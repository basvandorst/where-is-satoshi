You wouldn't even need to hard fork. Just get &gt; 51% of miners to agree to orphan and rewrite the chain and exclude the transaction. 12 hours of block rewards is only 900 BTC. Even 48 hours would still only be 3,600 BTC.
You could easily give the miners double that in exchange for reversing the 1M BTC transaction, or even a little more, without spending even 1% of the hoard (10,000 BTC). What miner wouldn't want 2x or 3x their normal income?

I'd argue that that's not really a paper wallet at that point.
Traditionally paper wallets are for a single keypair, not for a recovery seed, and if you were to stamp a keypair on metal you're encouraging yourself to reuse an address.

Not to mention clustered/decentralized filesystems like CephFS and LizardFS, which can scale to **petabytes** quite easily and cheaply, and can sustain 50MB/s write speeds on shitty hardware.
@_date: 2015-12-03 02:32:42
Then you're likely fine, but it's worth considering that if I was a malware writer, I'd make a wallet stealer that quietly activated a month or two after installation and not move the coins until, say, 3-6 months. That way my crack would be the popular one, and I could get tons of victims.
That sort of thing is what scares me - viruses that don't do damage for a while, and go undetected.

Completely agree. His expressions when answering the questions say it all. I'm 95% sure he is Satoshi, which is amazing considering I was 95% sure *someone else* was (a person that, like Craig, no-one has mentioned until now).

EDIT: Yes, you are safe***r***, but not completely safe. There may be malware attached to cracked releases that is so new that nothing picks it up yet. The release of a widely anticipated game like Fallout 4 is the perfect opportunity to infect unsuspecting users. 
Private trackers usually scan and audit things both before and after they're uploaded, but if the crack is tainted with a new virus or trojan they may mistakenly let it through anyway.

The block reward in the Genesis block can't technically be moved due to a quirk in the code. But I think you mean early coins in general that could be associated with Satoshi.

It's unlikely he threw them away. Read the rest of the thread.
@_date: 2014-11-25 18:56:51
Clearly you know better than these people and their DIRTY, DIRTY FIAT CURRENCY.
Unfortunately in the real world Bitcoin isn't considered real money. Which - don't get me wrong - is incredibly unfair and untrue. But that's how regular people see it and until it takes off in a ridiculous way people will continue to see it that way.
I'd say we're about 50% of the way there in terms of adoption. Maybe someone should make a remittance service for Bitcoin?

Interesting - any links?
"So, with five potential candidates, was Satoshi Nakamoto responsible for any of the recent spends of early bitcoins?
The answer is no, and the following visualization was prepared by Coinometrics, to show that none of Satoshi’s extraNonce-related Coinbase rewards have been spent. The originating blocks of the February 2014 example outlined above, are shown in orange. Satoshi’s long strands of mined blocks are clearly visible – and they all remain unspent."

@_date: 2014-12-22 19:10:15
True, but this is a much more active threat. Generally most people actively searching for Bitcoin on eBay will have enough of an interest in it to have some idea of the price (after all, that's probably what they're around for - to make money!) and thus will not be as affected.
(Note, I'm not saying most adopters are jumping on now to make money, but those un-savvy enough to use eBay to buy BTC definitely are! Pretty much everyone else is either being given it or using Coinbase)
@_date: 2014-12-17 00:29:35
That's... Oddly brilliant
@_date: 2014-10-27 19:15:49
I was actually tempted to write about that - consumer confusion and fragmentation within mobile payment systems only serves to make Bitcoin an even better alternative.

@_date: 2014-10-23 10:11:58
Very cool.
@_date: 2014-12-19 23:51:05
True... but that doesn't make coloured coins any less of a bad idea.
What happens when you accidentally include one as a tx fee? I know a lot of clients have protection for this, but coloured coins skate so close to danger that it's just not a good idea.
@_date: 2014-12-18 19:49:28
This one, apparently.
@_date: 2014-12-10 00:01:54
Could be a simple screwup, and Satoshi was known to try to obscure his language origin.

Unfortunately wealth inequality is a very real thing, so I feel for you. I think there's a place for tips &lt; $5 for sure, and as I said in cryptocurrency communities there really is no limits. But perception is a very real problem outside of these.

He may not end up giving them to his kids/heirs for fear of spoiling them.
@_date: 2014-10-30 19:07:17
It would be interesting to send half of the private key to them via registered mail, then the other half when it's signed for. That way you could have pretty decent proof you sent it.
@_date: 2014-10-05 22:38:11
Eh, who can tell. It's malleable.
@_date: 2014-08-16 22:42:06
True. It doesn't seem to fit with his personality to cash it out for money.
I guess I'm more interested in "spends" in the sense of moving coins around or buying things with them.
@_date: 2014-07-31 23:07:07


Really, you're using them as your icon?
They are traitors.
@_date: 2014-12-09 03:57:33
No. I just don't feel like wasting my time digging for stuff you can easily research yourself, sorry. It's **way more than a handful** to the point where I can't continue blaming the users. BCI has repeatedly fucked up and it shows. I suspect we're only going to find out more stuff like this over time.
@_date: 2014-11-25 19:14:47
Yeah, but I'm being optimistic as hell because I needed to balance the relatively negative nature of my comment. You're probably closer to right.
@_date: 2014-08-17 01:04:59
Interesting thought. I wish I could ask him what he'd do with them.
To me, him moving or spending the coins would be like a final demonstration that BTC can stand on its own, similarly to how he backed off hashrate once the network was strong.
Accordingly, I think we'll see him move his coins when he thinks the currency is very strong and won't be influenced much by his actions.
@_date: 2014-12-10 00:17:57
Creating doubt makes it more unlikely anyone will seriously dig.
@_date: 2014-12-08 20:24:46

Ephemeral with an NSA mirror, but yes.
@_date: 2014-08-17 19:32:28
As I posted earlier in the thread, Satoshi has said you should never delete a wallet, always keep it just in case. This makes me think it's unlikely he'd delete his private keys.
@_date: 2014-12-31 03:56:10


No, as reddit karma is useless by design. It acts almost solely as a reputation system.
It's a good question though :)
@_date: 2014-12-31 02:53:40
Well, that's why the etiquette specifically chooses a number low enough that the user has to actually spend some effort finding something they can spend Bitcoin on. That way the hope is they are exposed to the possibilities of BTC in the process - then that combines with the ease of use at checkout to show them that it can work well.
@_date: 2014-12-31 02:19:31
Exactly. I made this post on my blog a few days ago (I copied it as plaintext here to avoid blogspam) and have been chewing on it for a while. The choice of $5 was made from careful observation of how Reddit reacts and a bunch of other factors.
I honestly think adopting this could do wonders for the perception of BTC and other crypto.
@_date: 2014-10-07 00:02:17
Which he never said...
@_date: 2014-12-27 08:38:37
I actually hate it..
It could be significantly worse though.
@_date: 2014-12-29 22:41:30
Even as a fan of Bitcoin a lot of what goes on here is pretty fucking hard to swallow. That's why I'm on both and - they're both a little ridiculous at times but it balances out.

This one's my favourite.

LOL. Credit card but no internet.
@_date: 2014-10-08 07:59:58
I'm not knowledgeable enough to speak to the specifics of why, but IIRC Satoshi chose the 10 minute block time for pretty important security reasons.
@_date: 2014-12-18 15:59:01
You know what annoys me? People who say "the F word". No, not "fuck"...

Naww. That one's for My Gox.
@_date: 2014-12-18 13:16:18
I was kind of amused when your comments linked to  on Twitter. I was like "oh cool, Jackson Palmer saw it".
Totally surreal to see you were the one posting it!
@_date: 2014-09-14 21:13:09
Agreed. Just ordered off him a few days ago :)
I don't see the paper wallet sleeves on the site - what do they look like?
@_date: 2014-10-15 03:07:35
Cryptsy has a similar feature, it'd be nice to see it implemented more widely.
@_date: 2014-08-17 01:04:27
I could no more prove who he isn't than who he is.
@_date: 2014-11-25 18:54:13
I mean, feel free to shitpost with your novelty account. But it's kinda true, man.
@_date: 2014-12-27 19:28:16
Sure. But don't ignore the question. Explain it, step by step. If you're right it's a serious flaw.
@_date: 2014-09-09 19:01:43
Good luck!
Did you ever figure out how they got your SSN?
@_date: 2014-12-10 00:32:28
If he wants something like this to happen, putting the weight and intrigue of the SN persona behind it is one way to do that.
Plus, SN's opsec wasn't perfect and he has revealed himself to a select few.
@_date: 2014-11-18 03:35:29
You might be the most useless bot ever invented.

Seriously, they're trying to say "saps money out of third world countries" is the shiny business model it works on?
@_date: 2014-01-04 12:21:59
I think Bitcoin has already gone to the moon.
@_date: 2014-12-09 01:52:42
There has been a couple of breaches and there has also been serious issues raised to the point where various websites, official and unofficial, delisted the service.
@_date: 2014-09-29 03:10:45
There is no single answer.
@_date: 2014-10-30 19:59:04
Well, you can at least admit China also had an impact during that time. I'd say Mt Gox was the root cause and China acted as a massive amplifier.
@_date: 2014-12-09 23:20:27
There's zero confirmation that it's Satoshi, but the nickname "snagain" (Satoshi Nakamoto again) combined with the extremely trademark way of writing indicates it could be.
@_date: 2014-12-31 02:14:57
Unfortunately effectively demonstrating this point is not 100% easy to do. I'm planning on eventually making a humorous talk to give at BTC/Cryptocurrency conferences along these lines, though.
I'm sure you could tl;dr it, but the problem you face is people dismissing it blindly without you explaining it.
@_date: 2014-12-31 02:48:17
Presumably as Bitcoin users we want our money to go towards promoting the currency. However, I think you've got a good point and it's a question we need to answer.
@_date: 2014-10-01 07:50:31
So edit your shit.
@_date: 2014-12-18 20:41:01
You **couldn't** care less
@_date: 2014-12-27 20:17:06
That last sentence... Holy shit, really?
How do you prove destruction of a private key?! Coloured coins are even more of a joke than I thought... Holy crap.
@_date: 2014-12-18 15:58:21
Like Reddit has never fucking sworn on the front page before?
Just swear. Don't be a pussy about it. See how many shitty words you can fit into one expletive-laden comment.
@_date: 2014-11-13 20:13:17
Oh wait. You were serious.
@_date: 2014-12-11 20:02:34
@_date: 2014-12-31 01:07:27
Holy shit. Consider for a moment all the electricity involved in transmitting and receiving this tip... how many satoshis would that be worth?
@_date: 2014-10-29 04:13:29
If you did so through I think that was offchain. Let's see if it reacts to me saying $2000.
@_date: 2014-12-09 12:52:56
You seriously think Silk Road had fucking venture capital funding?
Or are you referring to SR2 issuing refunds after that hack?
@_date: 2014-09-12 09:44:28
Interesting - thanks for the tip! I might give them one last try...
@_date: 2014-12-29 08:51:08
No. I think it's less likely to end in horrible and unmitigated disaster, though.
Tell me, how do you lock an asset with coloured coins?
@_date: 2014-12-31 04:35:31
I mean that if you took every single piece of hardware involved and the running costs etc they incurred while processing the tip it's likely that would add up to 400 satoshi or more. Perhaps that's an exaggeration but it just served as an example.
@_date: 2014-12-31 04:40:53


I agree with you in theory. In fact I originally had a paragraph addressing exactly that. The issue is that if you consider the number of people tipping vs the overall size of reddit there's a slim chance someone will ever get tipped twice, a much lower chance they'll get tipped three times and an almost impossible chance they'll make it to four times.
The point is to make that "Whoa, what just happened here?" moment **actually, 100% genuine** - when you throw $5 at someone, people will *take notice*.
@_date: 2014-12-27 18:24:44
Holy shit, amazing.


I thought you were addressing FUD, not outright creating it. Tell me, how ***exactly*** do you see this issue occurring?
@_date: 2014-10-30 17:25:06
No, fuck the price.
User and merchant adoption and number of TXes is a much better indicator.
@_date: 2014-12-27 18:18:46
Tell me, how is any of that remotely better than using something that actually works, like Counterparty?
@_date: 2014-12-31 02:24:47
I agree this is less of a factor for Dogecoin - people play with it *because* it's silly - but it still matters there.
I have definitely observed this with Bitcoin though.
@_date: 2014-10-30 17:25:43
It would be awesome if Bitcoin adopted Semantic Versioning to help clarify this.
@_date: 2014-12-20 12:46:42
Hmm. It seems like a good idea but I don't know how well it will work in practice. 
Even if that's the case you'll be able to send coins to *bitcoin* addresses and fuck that up. 
@_date: 2014-12-09 12:55:49
Huh. I believe you but a source would be excellent.
@_date: 2014-08-18 20:17:38
Insight is also open source...
@_date: 2014-12-27 18:02:46
Haha, agreed. This is just for fun.
Pickup lines are lame anyways.
@_date: 2014-12-30 01:25:32
Not sure yet, sorry.
@_date: 2014-12-31 09:00:37
Same here.
@_date: 2014-08-17 04:34:29
Yup. Satoshi's coins entering circulation would be a very big deal.
@_date: 2014-08-17 00:28:58
Satoshi is not the feds.
@_date: 2014-10-30 19:15:30
This is... actually good for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-12-08 20:23:48
Hang on, from what I've seen he supposedly gave back all of it - most users just were either too embarrassed to come forward or don't use Reddit.
EDIT: also in many cases the original owner couldn't prove it was them.
@_date: 2014-10-24 06:56:08
It's awful.
@_date: 2014-12-05 23:05:06
"If I buy more coins my old ones become cheaper!"
@_date: 2014-12-27 21:03:51
Thank you for that. I sincerely appreciate you taking the time and effort to explain that all properly.
I'll give it a proper read later, it's going over my head right now. But thanks, without a hint of sarcasm.
@_date: 2014-10-08 16:46:23
I'm waiting for someone else to chime in. If they don't I'll hunt down a source.
@_date: 2014-12-17 03:26:09
This was the only time it was appropriate to tip in Satoshis... And you fucked it up.
@_date: 2014-08-01 03:31:44
They gave a nod of approval to the NY measures that will severely cripple all cryptocurrencies if they pass.
@_date: 2014-08-26 23:07:09
Short answer: don't.
@_date: 2014-09-12 00:17:24
Had the same issue. I've opened a ticket each time, and each time it's gone to 12 out of 4 confirmations before going through.
In short: stop using cryptsy. They suck.
@_date: 2014-12-19 07:25:56
Hey, it's better than changetip.
@_date: 2014-10-30 18:28:23
Yes you are.

Oh wait, you were serious. Let me laugh even harder.
That will only happen if snagain's plan comes to fruition.

@_date: 2014-10-19 00:46:06
Thank you for saying what was on my mind. +gold
@_date: 2014-12-31 03:51:37
Agreed. I don't mind it in cryptocurrency subreddits - it's a great example of the flexibility of this stuff - but outside it just pisses people off.
I actually saw a 1 satoshi tip today. It's worth considering that there were probably over 400 satoshis involved in the actual posting of the comment giving it...
@_date: 2014-08-13 05:48:17
Whoa! Interesting.
@_date: 2014-12-31 04:31:12
Yes, I did, and we pretty much agree with each other. But you asked for my opinion, so there it is :P
@_date: 2014-08-17 01:16:12
Yup c:
@_date: 2014-08-16 22:29:24
Haha. Indeed he does :)
@_date: 2014-10-30 17:23:05
Not quite. You have to download the whole thing but it trims it as it goes, so if you set a 5GB limit it'll only take 5GB of storage.
@_date: 2014-12-10 00:19:06
I think that's fair enough, but obsoleting SWIFT would be worth it for enemies of the US.
@_date: 2014-12-31 03:58:02
Sorry I lost you. It's still worth reading the rest in my opinion; I go into the details of why I said that.
@_date: 2014-12-31 04:32:45
$1 doesn't buy you anything, unfortunately (the core argument of the thread). I definitely appreciate it though! Thanks!
@_date: 2014-12-31 02:37:46
Well, slightly less since ChangeTip wasn't involved in mine. But my point is that his comment is tipping FAR less than the actual cost of transmitting it.
@_date: 2014-11-15 07:45:34
How do you guys make money, if you don't mind my asking?
@_date: 2014-11-24 21:52:11
Can we have the one without the obscure references to satoshis?
@_date: 2014-08-17 02:51:38


Oct. 3, 2010: Sigh… why delete a wallet instead of moving it aside and keeping the old copy just in case? You should never delete a wallet. - Satoshi
@_date: 2014-10-30 18:38:30
Yes. Credit will always matter, it'll just be done in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-12-18 03:38:06


And here you excellently demonstrated that you have neither knowledge of how Dogecoin works, nor a shred of credibility.
@_date: 2014-10-27 19:18:28
Yes, I'm aware it's ACH transfer. That's why I mentioned Coinbase, which uses the same damn system. FDIC protects against your *bank* going under. As far as I'm aware it doesn't help with fraud. Anyways, it's irrelevant because this post is being deleted anyways.

mt.gox leak? did I miss something?
"In a possibly related incident, a user on the BitcoinTalk forum posted a message–since deleted by the forum’s moderators–claiming to be offering for sale a 20 gigabyte stolen database from Mt. Gox, including the personal details of all its users and even scans of their passports. “This document will never be elsewhere published by us,” wrote the user, who went by the name nanashi____. “Selling it one or two times to make up personal loses from gox closure.” The hacker asked for a price of 100 bitcoins for the database, about $63,600 at current exchange rates. ‘"
@_date: 2014-11-22 13:31:19
Your title is borked, right? You mean they asked to remove "Bitcoin Vs. Western Union" as you said in your post.
@_date: 2014-12-09 02:09:06
Nothing really solid, but numerous reports from users that their funds were stolen with no recourse from BCI.
It's been known for a long time that things were a bit shoddy, though some of that blame admittedly lies on the users.
@_date: 2014-12-31 04:33:19
I don't think they do.
@_date: 2014-12-08 00:59:08
You got a donated PC... and then you threw it away?
@_date: 2014-09-12 07:44:12
Yep. It's between $600-$800 off contract depending on the country.
@_date: 2014-12-31 10:12:30
Then that's a serious bug and it needs to be fixed.
@_date: 2015-05-13 04:00:20
You can't counterfeit altcoins either. Double-spending doesn't duplicate the coin.

@_date: 2014-12-31 04:42:13
Well, I tested that with a number of my coworkers. Generally they were confused and a little taken aback - tiny, tiny gifts are cool, but in the form of money they have a different meaning.
@_date: 2017-02-10 00:41:12
Yes. Change proof of work and fire all the existing miners.
@_date: 2014-11-25 18:32:48
I know what a satoshi is.
The general public doesn't. And they don't need to. And I don't want them to have to. And trying to convince me otherwise is a fruitless effort.
Save the lingo for the inner circle. For people who care enough about Bitcoin to *want* to learn shit like this. We shouldn't force them.

I mean to some extent I agree, but it's also easy for people to fall into the trap.

Greed will fuck any system the minute it kicks in. Whether that greed is money or power, it doesn't matter.
The only people that should be pulling strings is people that consent to it and *don't want to*.
Anyone can tip the scales in any particular direction to make a tiny  difference in the world, they just need to have the consent of others.
Decentralization is the future, but it's an extremely hard problem to solve and requires logical understanding beyond any single person.
Remember, democracy is the worst form of government, but it's the best we've got so far ;)

**In my opinion**, you are acting like a spoiled child throughout this thread, making silly arguments and brutally downvoting Tulip.

You're welcome, and good luck!
PS: if you plan to use your phone as a wallet, leave the phone unmodified (don't jailbreak or root it), and use a phone that runs an up-to-date OS (an iPhone or Nexus, ideally). That will significantly help in keeping your mobile wallets safe.

If you're using an exchange, they control the keys. 
If you're using a wallet of your own - paper, trezor, mycelium, whatever - where you alone control your keys and what to do with them, then you own your btc.
There's lots of different forms of wallet, so do your research and find which suits you best. Just don't use an exchange or web wallet to store your coins.

Just... stop, dude.
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:32:52
Holy shit, what? I totally know one of these girls IRL!
So... Since you're probably in Seattle, want to hang out?
@_date: 2016-01-05 05:49:37


$0037 CAD?
@_date: 2016-01-18 12:37:54
Fair enough. I tweaked the language of the OP, let me know if that's acceptable.
@_date: 2016-03-10 10:41:11
You call both of them "bitcoin", as the chances of the blockchain splitting into two long-lived chains is extremely unlikely.
As soon as one chain becomes the clear winner, everyone will migrate to it. And almost all coins will be valid on both chains.
@_date: 2016-01-17 07:29:25
Yep. That's supposedly an "alternative" Bitcoin B, but it's fuck-ugly.
@_date: 2016-03-14 06:54:04

Believe what you want to believe.
@_date: 2016-01-05 05:50:38


It's actually "faux pas", but it's pronounced as fo-pa.
@_date: 2016-03-22 05:08:41
Yep. And the system can easily be gamed if there's rewards for node operators, so it's actually pretty hard to do that *well*.
@_date: 2016-01-20 06:54:38
Are you gonna pay for your lunch?
@_date: 2016-03-03 14:14:56
Why did you editorialize the title?
@_date: 2015-01-06 20:51:13
Because a shitty exchange was gone.
@_date: 2014-12-29 22:16:01
Coinbase already supports subscriptions.
@_date: 2016-01-16 09:03:00
I strongly doubt Ethereum themselves have anything to do with it. Still damaging to their brand and reputation though.
@_date: 2016-01-16 03:10:03
Aaaargh! Damn it, you beat me to it!
@_date: 2016-03-20 13:32:45
Also, **don't use BCI's wallet.** Even though it's probably fine, they have a history of amateur mistakes and problems.

Oh, so that's what the kids are calling it now? ;)

You can say fuck here.

Except that Moore's law wasn't actually meant to last longer than a decade, has been revised multiple times, and is predicted to stop or slow down dramatically in the next decade or so.
It started as "transistor count doubles every year", a decade later became "doubles every 2 years" and now is understood to mean "performance doubles every 18 to 24 months".
@_date: 2016-01-27 04:38:28
You can buy $15 a day of Bitcoin with a PayPal account. Not ideal as they take a cut of ~15% to cover fraud and fees. But they are trustworthy and they work.
@_date: 2016-03-14 14:41:50
Yes, I'm already aware of the benefits of a hardware wallet... but a Trezor is far too expensive to justify given the amount of BTC I own. 
However, if I end up a little richer and want to buy a LOT more, I'll probably get a trezor.

One of my favourite bands is called The Paper Raincoat. Thanks for reminding me of them :)

Saying "DOWN VOTE" is even more juvenile.
@_date: 2016-03-08 04:35:04
I don't care how many people "get it". It's misleading at best and malicious at worst.
@_date: 2016-03-31 15:17:08


That's a bug, not a feature...
@_date: 2017-03-20 07:08:50
Nope, hah. I wish.
@_date: 2016-03-15 03:32:32
Try measuring your wealth in "bits" instead ;)
@_date: 2017-03-20 09:09:52
Wow. You're coming off pretty harsh.
@_date: 2017-03-24 08:49:00
This would completely wreck the "permissionless" property of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-15 16:39:26
Why are you calling Bitcoin "her"? It's neither a woman nor a ship.
@_date: 2016-01-20 14:47:47
You mean decimate, but yes.
@_date: 2016-01-02 14:52:17
But none with those withdrawal addresses, and those exact quantities. It would be trivial to deanonymize you if I were a skilled attacker.
@_date: 2017-03-20 08:54:09
Really? 'Cause I don't think it's Craig either.
@_date: 2016-01-26 10:08:19
Not to mention that Satoshi's coins are always being carefully watched. Moving them at all would make huge waves that would affect the price.
@_date: 2017-03-20 06:20:30
Szabo is not Satoshi.
@_date: 2017-03-27 01:13:57
Saying "Saying 'Saying "DOWN VOTE" is even more juvenile' is as juvenile as you can get." is even more juvenile than that.
@_date: 2017-03-20 06:34:35


That would be a pretty major violation of their privacy. But no, Szabo is not Satoshi.
Nice sarcasm.
@_date: 2016-03-12 13:27:03
It's perfectly in line with what Core says.
@_date: 2016-03-08 05:52:26
Wow, such professionalism.
@_date: 2016-03-19 06:54:35


Minor nitpick here...
Please either use 40Mbit/s or 40Mbps (or the lower-case forms, 40mbit/s and 40mbps). The capitalized B usually represents bytes, where a lowercase b usually represents bits.
@_date: 2017-03-21 02:21:49
uh, can you not?
@_date: 2016-01-16 07:37:04
Yep. I liked Ethereum, this shit is turning me off!
@_date: 2016-01-26 07:47:01


Citation needed... Segwit doesn't count as a block size increase, though it helps.
@_date: 2014-09-29 02:35:58
...and somehow it's worse quality. How did you manage that!?
@_date: 2014-12-18 20:17:39
Yup. That's not chump change.
@_date: 2017-03-20 06:48:49


@_date: 2016-06-16 16:25:46
Yep. Also, there is no "official" value.
@_date: 2016-06-24 06:50:07
Despite that not being how you pronounce it...
@_date: 2016-06-18 19:15:14
It's Ethereum, not Etherium.
@_date: 2016-06-24 06:56:43
Bleh. That black and white B is non-standard and shouldn't be used. The rest look awesome though.
@_date: 2016-06-20 08:26:45
I don't mind Monero, but don't advertise it here.

Somehow that's funnier in lowercase. Now I'm imagining that character saying that quote very calmly.

@_date: 2016-06-01 15:59:18

@_date: 2016-11-14 06:17:27


@_date: 2017-01-09 10:27:22
I guess that's part of my point. You need to invest a lot of money for mining to be viable these days.
Thanks for the explanation. Makes sense to me.
@_date: 2016-12-13 04:40:45
That is literally impossible. You're talking about storing billions of tx in 8,000 bytes? If we pretend every single **bit** can store a tx, that gives us 64,000 tx max.
@_date: 2016-12-30 04:45:37






You were saying?
@_date: 2016-11-16 10:58:33


That statement is cringeworthy nowadays.
@_date: 2016-12-30 04:28:14


That is completely disingenuous. I deleted it because I made a better point in a different comment, not because it was wrong.
@_date: 2017-08-16 05:07:06
Have you ever tried syncing the blockchain over 2G?
@_date: 2016-12-30 05:16:12
That's my line.
@_date: 2017-08-22 04:45:29


Why do people feel the need to add stuff like that to comments? It makes me downvote you when I wouldn't have otherwise...
@_date: 2016-11-16 11:38:22
At least 100.
@_date: 2016-12-30 04:50:08
If you edit quickly enough they won't appear, but that only allows you enough time to fix typos, not to change something based on a reply. It has a very short timer to prevent exactly that.

@_date: 2016-12-30 04:31:13
I never said it was the first line in the video. I said it was the first line in the description.
As for it being facetious, that is not at all obvious so that doesn't feel like a valid defence.
@_date: 2016-12-30 04:20:41
First line in the video description: "This is the **official** Bitcoin song"
You were saying?
@_date: 2016-11-09 03:27:39


Uh, no.
We're not going to be able to transmit information faster than light for a long time. Reaching the other side of the world in a millisecond is not possible according to current physics.

Why do you resort to name-calling?
@_date: 2017-09-18 14:47:02
For a ballpark, I'd say that I personally wouldn't store more than around $3,000 USD on a single wallet.
Others may have wildly different figures. For some, $10,000 is a reasonable limit. For some a limit under $100,000 is unmanageable!
@_date: 2017-09-01 01:13:24
What about when your real money is worth less than it costs to produce it? 
@_date: 2018-02-21 10:12:36
Np, thanks for being chill about it
@_date: 2017-09-18 14:36:58
That depends on a lot of factors. I think it's going to vary from person to person based on how many secure places they have access to, both in a physical and digital sense, as well as their own personal risk tolerance.
@_date: 2017-10-16 07:42:45
@_date: 2017-09-26 04:49:25
You have a terrible attitude.

But bigger seats wouldn't allow you to fit more pe-OHHHHH
@_date: 2017-09-01 05:56:21
If we ever get to the point where a single satoshi is worth $1, we'll simply do a fork to add additional precision. We'll know many years ahead of time that it's necessary, so it can be planned over a ~2-3 year period and implemented in an uncontroversial way.
Unlike the blocksize debacle, I think just about everyone would agree with a precision fork.

Nice humblebrag... but you should probably split those coins across multiple hardware wallets (Trezor or KeepKey should be fine) and secure them as best you can.
Also, bragging about how much BTC you own is a great way to attract $5 wrench attacks.

Uh, browsers don't work like that.

Fees will slowly take over around the time the block reward really tapers off. Hopefully price will continue to rise during each halving like it has in the past.

They need a hardware wallet. In fact they need multiple hardware wallets...

Running 3 full nodes on one internet connection is pointless, unless you have a different public IP for each of them and allow connections properly.

Block reward isn't set to run out for a long time.

Is that really necessary?

Well, all censorship is bad, so how is it not the same thing?
@_date: 2015-09-04 14:01:32


And yet I'm okay with banning child pornography, snuff films and other evil shit...
@_date: 2017-10-25 00:02:07
Sure, if your browser gets exploited and your computer compromised that can happen.
Under normal circumstances each tab is sandboxed (true for Chrome, not true for Firefox) and killing it kills anything it was running.

@_date: 2015-09-13 03:38:02
I can't help but notice he uses similar language to Satoshi.

Can't wait to mine 2 satoshi a week on my smartphone and shorten its life by months/years :P

Why did you lump Dogecoin in there? What did it do wrong?

Hot damn I can't wait for part 2.

Probably not.

@_date: 2016-10-12 11:27:10
Maybe they mean they're not carrying/supporting any alt-coins.

Which is itself an absolute...

@_date: 2017-05-01 03:28:15
of course :)
thanks for being cool about it.

DO NOT use such a site! A bunch of those will be set up specifically to steal your coins!

It's Swype, actually. Perhaps proving your point...

Fair enough.

It's UASF, not USAF.

It just so happens that your friend here is only MOSTLY dead. There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. Mostly dead is slightly alive.

Electrum's site has been down for weeks for me.

@_date: 2015-10-17 12:00:15


I'm a subscriber to both and I find both extremely valuable, and post in both. I try to avoid participating in threads that Buttcoin links to - no brigading and all that.
My concern is that I could be singled out for posting to both subs, despite following the rules and rediquette to the letter. 
I don't come here to troll, nor do I come to Buttcoin to promote Bitcoin. I come here for the interesting insights, hopes and dreams, and I go to Buttcoin for the comedy and the reality.
I hope I'm welcome here with these new rules in mind.
@_date: 2016-05-22 10:30:31


Uhh, nice try.
It's wherewithal.
@_date: 2017-07-21 10:06:21
The altcoin is not called ABC or BU or BC or anything like that. At this stage it's "Bitcoin Cash", whatever that will end up meaning.
@_date: 2017-07-04 03:05:50


@_date: 2017-05-19 03:10:54
Completely agree.
@_date: 2016-05-05 05:52:02


Not sure why you're using a gendered word there.
@_date: 2015-10-05 13:09:27
Off-topic, but your name is awesome.
@_date: 2015-10-29 08:56:54
That would be a solid idea, except this is the case on Chrome, Safari and Firefox on OS X, and on Chrome for Android...
EDIT: Interesting! It works if I access it using my cellular connection. Maybe Telstra/Bigpond are censoring it?
@_date: 2016-05-22 10:58:52


Was that intentional? Either way, bravo...
@_date: 2016-05-04 06:39:58


Wow, you just reek of maturity.
@_date: 2016-05-02 17:49:10
Tenebrix. It was a fork of Tenebrix.
@_date: 2016-05-06 05:48:48


Why do you feel the need to corrupt the name?
@_date: 2016-05-20 01:46:05


It's actually "phishing" in this context.
@_date: 2017-07-17 10:17:07


Whoa! Can we not do that here?
@_date: 2017-07-24 01:31:09


**bear** in mind.
@_date: 2015-10-17 12:18:07
Thanks :) I hope you're right.
@_date: 2015-10-02 03:09:02
I'm disappointed to see this shit coming from you.
For shame.
@_date: 2017-07-07 07:41:25
Perhaps because the alert system is deprecated?
@_date: 2017-07-07 08:05:09
Yes, but the page you're linking to is a reflection of the alerts that have gone out on the network. It's legacy and not intended to still be used AFAIK.
@_date: 2016-05-05 06:20:29


You mean a Raspberry Pi?
@_date: 2015-10-03 05:01:53
That's a link to your opinion.
Thanks for the downvote, though.
@_date: 2016-05-20 07:50:30
Who's on first?
@_date: 2016-07-04 07:56:35


The irony of making a grammar mistake while calling someone stupid.
@_date: 2016-07-05 05:39:06
Shave and a haircut... two bits ;)

Do you mean passive *cooling*?

Can you please not use being gay (or being implied to be gay) as an insult?

Eh. I'm just trying to help.
@_date: 2016-07-04 08:19:17
Thanks for the downvote, sweetie. :)
EDIT: And again! I feel so loved!
@_date: 2016-07-23 08:05:54


That's a nasty DoS vector...
@_date: 2016-07-16 05:09:24
It's bad and confusing enough that it's likely going to stop me from using or recommending your service.
@_date: 2016-07-03 10:24:25
Mt Gox is fantastic. It's so secure I can't even access my funds, and no-one else can either!

@_date: 2018-12-24 04:27:51
I've got 4 of them and love them. Would make great full nodes some day. I use them as a distributed NAS.
@_date: 2017-06-21 00:51:54


This is patently false. In pruned mode they can help propagate blocks, but they can't help new nodes sync as they don't have blocks older than 144 blocks old (around 24 hours).
(That said, you can change how many blocks are stored in pruning mode if you want to).
@_date: 2017-06-22 06:41:45
@_date: 2017-06-08 01:13:20
Thanks for the transparency. It's much needed at this time.
@_date: 2017-07-17 10:39:35
Irregardless is not a word. You mean *regardless* or *irrespective*.
@_date: 2017-06-19 08:36:27
I'm going to respond anyways.
@_date: 2016-05-31 17:12:35
Wow. This could have some big implications.
@_date: 2017-06-01 02:00:44
my what?
@_date: 2016-07-13 08:09:19


My what?
