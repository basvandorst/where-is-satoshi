In the US an engagement ring counts as a present, so she gets to keep it if something happens.. If that's the case, I'd think that she'd get to keep both btc.

REITs. If you can afford BTC you can afford to invest in real estate.

Gold and REITs are both easier to buy online than BTC.

I could easily buy a REITs or Gold ETF through vanguard. Maybe there is clearing period, so you could be right that it's slightly slower, idk.
Either way, what OP said is wrong.

Do people on this sub really think banks are scared of crypto? Or that they wouldn't love for paper money to go away?
Is there a more delusional sub on the whole, than this one?

I dont think you know what the word 'value' means. If you can reliably trade it for stuff, how does it have no value?
This sub is as bad as flat earther subs.

You're right, Jamie Dimon is so concerned with the influence this sub has, that he pays me to come and take it down from within.
Way to crack the case.

Lol, so now I'm a shill for big banks? Like I said, the delusion on this sub is REAL.
@_date: 2019-10-30 19:58:51
You are a strange fella
@_date: 2019-10-30 15:27:03
The delusion is real with you...

In all fairness, he said Bitcoin was a scam. He always said there was a future for the block chain technology.
Thus sub loves to get their panties all bunched up....

Imagine drinking this much Kool Aid....

You're right, I'm the troll. Not this sub who constantly claims the world is going to end, and Bitcoin will save us all.
You people that buy and 'HODL' aren't doing crypto any favors by the way. Bitcoin isn't meant to be a longterm investment vehicle, it's meant to be used in transactions as a currency. 
The more ppl that bury it in their backyards, the worse off it is.
