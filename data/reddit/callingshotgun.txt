I suspect many who assume that are actually defining "failure" as "not a worldwide standard currency".  So while it might not match our definition of failure, they're at least being internally consistent.

I was under the impression they didn't have the necessary private key to the main address holding all those coins.  It's not like a house or physical good that can just change hands-  They need the private key in order to reflect on the blockchain that the bitcoins changed wallets.

I think the basic idea from their perspective is that they get your money up front, as opposed to the gradual drip of btc over the course of a year from the hashrate they sold you, and they can take that money and buy more mining hardware with it. When your year long contract is up, they'll have the mining power they bought with your money at the beginning of your contract, plus the mining power of your recently expired one.  I'm not saying this isn't risky, and I don't know how much better the profit margin on this is than just keeping all the mining power for themselves, I'm just saying there's a little more to it than "if it was profitable they'd keep it", since with btc buying now seems to have huge financial advantages over buying later.

I get why others voted for this change, but I *liked* having the 50% reinvstment managed for me.  It just happened by itself.  Do any havelock securities do it that way currently?

With the proliferation of vanity wallets, how difficult is it to generate an address that approximates this one?  By approximates, I mean will look similar to the lazy human, basically starting with "1GPW" and ending with "7g", because that's where the average person who actually spot-checks the matching signatures will look.

What does the doge say?

So, this ended up getting voted in, which makes me sad.  Part of the reason I invested in Petamine was that in stark contrast to other rigs like cex, you bought shares instead of raw gh/s, and the 50% re-invest meant that the GHS/share was ever-increasing.  The net effect of all this was that I didn't have to go in once a week and manually re-invest 50% of my dividend in growth of my position (it happened for me), and the cost/benefit of that reinvestment wasn't at the mercy of whatever price swing happened that day to share prices.

cex.io is currently selling ghs at roughly 16 cents.  It's another cloudhashing company, so, you know, grain of salt an everything, but GHS tend to sell on cex for around what they'll make if you keep them forever.  So assume a single gigahash will only ever make you 16 cents.  Hell, let's round up using the power of optimisim and say 20 cents.  Making those 20 cents over the next year or two will cost you 14 cents a month.
The important thing here is, at NO SCALE does it make sense to EVER purchase a cloudhashing contract from these guys again.  They're effectively charging more per month than any contract is capable of ever making back.
Which is sad, because I bought an 8 ghs contract from them a little over a year ago, and using the reinvestment, have managed to earn back about half a BC, and gradually grow my rig to 28, which are effectively worthless.
