Can someone explain this to me? I've done some research on the blockchain ect why is Bitcoin the central thing we need? Could we not have a different crypto currency? How do we combat, or is it something that even is a problem that the money supply is limited to 21 million bitcoins?

I agree Bitcoin is~~ inferior~~ superior but that was based off assumptions Fed would not raise rates and the economy would experience what we might be experiencing now if this downturn in China is the start of somthing

Kek MUHHH KEYNES MUHHH ANIMAL SPIRITS REEEEEE. 
Yea not like the Austrians figured out their Keynesians policy would lead to 2008 6 years before, but hey I’m sure have 0% interest rates for the last 10 years and 20 trillion in debt will have no repercussions just keep spending because hey in the long run we’re all dead right?

But apparently im a loon because I'm a libertarian and think both parties are two sides of the same coin. I don't give a fuck about muh free college, muh free healthcare, muh Jesus, muh bathrooms when we keep getting closer and closer to Tyranny.

Yea the Federal Reserve did great good thing we didn't have the worst market downturns in our country's history since 1913 
@_date: 2017-09-29 12:05:17
Sure in the short term, however the bubble created as a result will be much worse 
@_date: 2017-09-07 19:57:40
You're right 
I recommend people read Murray Rothbard's 'America's Great Depression' and Tom Woods 'Meltdown' for reading about it.
Also good regarding The Fed
