overly complicated, my goal is to create something simple that anyone can use sorta like a fusion of Quora and reddit.

good luck!

not dedicated to it.

What we have now works perfectly why overcomplicate it...
@_date: 2018-09-11 05:47:49
Do you have any advice? I'm open to suggestions although I thought it was pretty innovative myself.

not wishing anyone dead, its simply fact is it not? we all die of old age eventually... no amount of wealth or status can currently prevent it.
also why you hating on my posts in this sub lol.

I have only just created this site, it needs a much larger community to create the content.

Thank you (: although it is more of a Q&amp;A site rather than a place for general conversation like reddit, kinda like Quora i guess except dedicated towards Crypto.
@_date: 2018-07-16 23:44:18
thank you, i will try that quickly.
@_date: 2018-07-22 20:29:06
