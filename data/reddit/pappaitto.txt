They had their chance, but Bernie lost. Now its just average, progressively inflationary first-world fiat.

Love the username. Do you see any similarities between MtGox behaviour and Coinbase / Bitfinex behaviour nowadays?
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:16:04
Did you notice at some point the tide going from positive to negative overall? Media, reddit, everywhere? Or was it always a mixed pack?

Also would not be smart to stop researching once you've bought in.

Please consider turning some Lambos back to BTC and tear down that wall

Wow. How big is your mother's basement?

Same. Long Live Andreas. (btw, becoming his patron on Patreon is an investment for anyone holding BTC)

Did you see a lot of reddit posts / tweets with a "fuck, I was wrong, we were delusional, selling now" theme?
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:16:59
Is it? Thanks. Didn't know. Selling all my coins now. BRB.

Not much elaboration possible - essentially the downtime during the first 10K and some of the cryptotwitter hating on Coinbase + their position about 2X
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:14:30
Whats that about fake buy orders? ELI5 please

Damn Lambo lobby
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:29:57
That is great. Thanks a lot.
Btw, for a second I thought the survey on top was from the time of the first comments ($70) and thought people had really lost their mind around 2013.

Do you perceive the 1100 peak back then similar to today? In reddit / Twitter that is.
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:25:26
Because that's a slight acknowledgement of defeat. A few years ago they eliminated three zeros from the currency (and called it "strong", as if now we say that the 100 USD = 1 strongUSD, and the StUSD is the new currency). But they have been increasing the denominations.

Why did it seem a pretty clear floor?

Awesome reference
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:35:28
Yes, but I was thinking a dedicated laptop (cannot set up a rig in a hotel room). Could make sense?
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:45:24
Thanks for the solid answers. Dumb and very material question: Does the laptop have to be open while mining? Hotel staff might screw up if they see a big machine open and running something strange. 
When you say around 2 bucks per day, you mean at current 10K+ price?
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:56:41
That is awesome. 10K thanks. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:34:57
Can it be done and make sense nowadays with a laptop? One dedicated only to mining. What would I need?
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:02:48
Makes sense. No rush, in any case. Appreciate it!

It's me akai the infamous ~~Nigerian prince~~ Central Bank, gimme all your cryptos and I'll will give you my inheritance through the mail. FTFY

Hotel is owned by a Nigerian prince that scams people by email. I want to be his Robin Hood.
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:42:01
So a dedicated laptop with a powerful GPU is out of question?
