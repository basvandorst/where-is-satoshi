Everyone here will tell you you can't trust any exchange, that you need to control your own coins.  I beg to differ.  I don't keep my wealth in cash under my mattress, I trust banks, mutual funds, and IRA services to hold it.  Coinbase is no different.  Keeping large sums of BTC on a hardware or paper wallet that could easily be lost is foolish if you ask me.

you should always expect a rejection from X950 that lasts a week or so, look historically.  it's a very bad move to enter at 7950 hoping for +150. you could have entered on either of the two bounces today and made more than that.

I'm saying no one would sell BTC for monopoly money, so why do they accept USDT?  Because they believe that USDT will still be in their account the next day, and can still be traded for BTC and other coins in the future.  Not saying YOU have to believe this, just that the prevailing opinion is clearly that USDT is safe, otherwise all the USDT pairings would have no volume.

@_date: 2017-11-05 21:37:06
I disagree. When BTC peaked at 3k and started falling it was easy to worry about it being a bubble. Sure it might recover, but previous recoveries took years.  But each time it bounces back up and forms a new higher high it proves its reliability as an investment.  The recovery and rally after the China ban is the most impressive of all. Combine that will all the growing interest from wall street and mainstream investors and things are looking very bright for the next few years, I don't think we will be seeing drops over 30%, the last one was only 12%.

Shorts also buy, that's part of how they profit. They need to push the price back up so they can push it down again.  Over time it averages out and doesn't impact the price.

If people actually believed tethers were fake monopoly money don't you think they would refuse to sell their BTC for USDT?  Apparently no one in the market is worried.
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:39:36
people will instantly trade their BTC into alts.  BTC will fall 5% or so, alts will jump 10-20%.
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:29:38
What are you talking about "significant profit", standard investment returns are 6-10%/year.  If bitcoin delivers 20%/year it is one of the best investments available.  Currently it is giving that much every month if not every week.

@_date: 2017-09-10 05:21:38
its due to a number of things.  First, demand is dropping in China right now, so prices are lower there.  Second, USDT value spikes during a dump, so prices in USDT appear lower than they really are. Finally, arbitrage is not as easy as it sounds because most traders are looking for quick trades, profiting from arbitrage takes weeks because you have to use fiat bank transfers to get your money back to the starting exchange.

It all depends on what timeframe you are trading.  You can trade the monthly, weekly, daily, 4hr, 1hr, 15min. Wouldn't recommend going lower than that.  Long term hodlrs don't think of themselves as traders, but they still had to buy at some point and to get any value out of their investment they have to sell at some point, which means they are still traders.  They are just trading the long-term charts like the monthly.
Personally I put the most weight on the daily and the 4hr.  The Daily tells you the overall trend, it doesn't change direction that frequently.  The 4hr is a better indicator of the current "mood".  Inside bar breaks on the daily or 4hr are the main signals I use for trading.  The 15 min is a good indicator of whether the 4hr trend may have stalled or is still in progress (bull trend needs to continually make higher lows and higher highs on the 15 min.).  However it can easily stall out for a few hours and then resume so its not all that predictive, just depends on your risk tolerance with the current trade.
@_date: 2017-10-18 15:31:31
Its just standard fib retracement.  On the daily chart there was an unbroken bull move from 4140 all the way to 5900, an insanely big move.  Typically any bull move will retrace back around 50% of its gain, which predicts a drop to 5028.
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:29:24
imo if you are going to sell, only sell before the big round numbers. In other words, wait for $6,900-6,950, don't sell right as the breakout is getting started.

@_date: 2017-10-19 02:46:28
Its a short term pattern, long term is driven by fundamentals.  Short term trading opportunities come from the price overshooting and then undershooting its "true value" (the moving average).
Good traders don't rely on statistical analysis, that's not how the market works. The market is driven by emotion: greed and fear.  Greed drives it up, fear makes it drop. The mood of the market changes week by week, day by day, hour by hour.  During a bad downtrend, retracements will be over 50% and very rapid.  During a strong bull trend they will be less than 50% and slower.  Its not like an iron law that holds in all cases, it's more a reflection of the current mood.  If there is no retracement that just means the mood is extremely bullish, it doesn't mean "TA is bullshit".  It pays to be cautious and always expect a deep retracement.

FYI your kindness is to be applauded, but you should be aware that this kind of charity is one factor that keeps poor countries poor.  It is hard to accumulate enough money to start a business or move to a better location for a job when everyone in your family and everyone you run into on the street is begging you for every penny you have, part of the cycle of poverty.  I'd encourage you to make sure you accumulate some savings even while giving handouts.

So what?
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:30:35
Oh of course, it will hit a hard ceiling at some point, probably long before $1M+. But I think anything under $100K is fair game just based on some fraction of money flowing from gold into BTC.
@_date: 2017-10-21 00:21:59
I've been thinking about this, I think the price is really an illusion.  What matters is the % return on your investment.  When BTC was $1000 you could invest $1000 and double your money eventually.  Now that BTC is $6000 has anything changed? Not really, you can still invest $1000 and double your money given enough time.

Eventually most of those altcoins are going to die off, no one will use them or speculate on their value, so their value will go to zero.  It will be a survival of the 'fittest coin". These early valuations are all based on speculation about the future, which coins will survive.  The winners will be very valuable since the supply is limited and merchants are not going to want to support dozens of different currencies.
While I agree these cryptocurrenceis are of little practical use in the US, they are extremely valuable internationally and for anyone who wants to move money around the world.

Sort of...but the US Government could decide to start printing a trillion dollars a day whenever they want, rendering your current USD worthless.  That's just how fiat currencies work.  Look at Venezuela.  Also look at this 3rd definition of Fiat money here:

I just think there is a dangerous misconception here about how markets work.  Many people think if they have a problem with their phone company they should just complain until it's fixed.  If the company doesn't respond they call for regulation and get the government involved.  This is a route to disaster.  $ is the market signal, not complaints.

I was one of those people. Had an opportunity to invest in 2011 and passed it up.  Had another in 2013, passed it up.

Success breeds complaints.  Many of the most successful companies get thousands of complaints directed at them every day.  Every single person at my workplace thinks McDonalds is a crappy place to eat, because they are upper-middle class snobs.  Doesn't matter because McDonalds has plenty of customers every day.  
Companies only need to serve a big enough customer niche to be successful given their scale.  As long as the dollars keep flowing in the door, complaints don't matter. 
In the case of Coinbase, if people actually start leaving the service, then yes it will have an effect, but often complaints are just hot air, not backed by action.  Moving money from Coinbase to a different exchange could trigger a taxable event, so people may not be ready to jump ship based on just 1 day of downtime. Also how is a customer to know other exchanges won't suffer the exact same problem when the reach Coinbase's scale?
