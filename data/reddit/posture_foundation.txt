We are still in the adoption period. Most of common folks just heard/ gave serious thought  about btc  last November. Things will still go up and down. 
Check out this article about technology adoption:
After 4-5 years, BTC are still at awareness level. Not even 10% of redditors in this sub completely understand BTC. And the rest of the world just aware about it 60 days ago and still think btc as virtual monopoly money.. Things will stabilize once we reach the the top part of the curve (internalization, or some say stagnation). 
Meanwhile, keep your btc, and buy more when it drops again (it will)

Crap! You're right! 
 or they pay the staff &amp; bills in bitcoins (yeah, not gonna happened anytime soon)

What do you think about vircurex?
@_date: 2014-01-12 13:49:04
I feel you man...
If you can, get a cheap pc/android phone only for offline btc wallet.. 
Also, spread your bitcoins on several online wallets / exchanges.
 Until something better came.

Whoa! 20-25%?

Can you elaborate a not smooth transaction? Of and do you order internationally or you reside in US?
@_date: 2014-01-04 02:43:32
Oh, and thank you for the post, very very educative! Looking forward for more post from you!
@_date: 2014-01-19 04:00:57
Im interested in amagi metals, you have good experience with them?
@_date: 2014-01-13 06:35:50
It's not bad at all... Companies still need to pay 7% GST anyway.. Regardless what product they sell
The basic rule is, If a purchase/transaction happen in singapore, it is subject of GST. It is fair in that way.
Bitcoin is not a way to evade tax, it is  an alternative currency that have better properties than other traditional currencies... But evading tax is not one of them.
As long as they treat it as any other transactions (same sales tax/gst), instead of charging additional tax only for BTC or even criminalizing it, I'm fine with it.
@_date: 2014-01-08 04:58:18
Yes, but can also serve as your "online wallet" with yubi key / google authenticator...
Haven't have problem in withdrawing btc.. Havent tried withdraw in us/euro though... Cos their rate sucks

Its ok, it happened to everyone. 
Think of it as learning fee.
 Happened to me when I first invest in precious metals years ago. It forced me to study more on the thing i am investing in and not just following the herd, and learned to suppress my emotion when making financial decision... Take the lesson &amp; move on
@_date: 2013-12-19 01:10:26
Oh, and since my peers are in their 30s.. They are mature enough to understand that you only put money that you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2013-12-24 02:46:13
US and Myanmar. But I can understand why Myanmar does it.
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:43:53
Relax, you will only lose if you sell them now.
It is an opportunity to buy more, or if you don't have the cash it it time to sit back n relax. Go to other subeddit, and come back in march
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:33:13
I mean fiat money wise..
And thats why in my other comments, i said "price drop is actually good news: buy buy buy"
@_date: 2013-12-16 14:37:39
Haha, yeah, me too!

Investor mentality (according to me at least): 
- not being bugged up by daily ups and downs... Looking far ahead.. Especially for products that just launched 5 yrs ago and gained minor popularity a year ago.
- use your head, not emotion
- invest with cash that you can afford to lose
- study &amp; believe in what you invest, not just following the crowd: i put my money in bitcoin because i believe the benefit of decentralized currency free from gov'ment manipulation. I want this thing to success.
- so yeah, sit back and relax... Life is more than just money 
@_date: 2013-12-15 04:45:22
Very unrelated, but please please please make mint available in singapore.. At least for the 2 main major bank...
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:18:07
There is only 3 possible scenarios here:
1) sell lower than when you buy, and you'll lose cash.
2) or btc eventually just become worthless. And well you'll lose everything
3)or the price will go up again, and you will lose nothing (and gain some)
For me, I'd rather hold it until the end. Why? Because I believe in bitcoin.
I believe decentralized currency is what we need: Free from government control, free from manipulation by people with power. I believe bitcoin system can help our future generation creating a fairer economy. And I don't want Cyprus thing happened again
For me, You must believe in what you invest your money and time in, whether it is bitcoin, stocks, or gold
Another sample: You buy tesla stock because you want cleaner energy.

This kid is obviously smarter than me, and I bet his peers also able to graps the idea better than  me &amp; my generation. Man I feel old now 
Great parenting job, by the way!
@_date: 2013-12-19 06:06:18
Agreed that bitcoin might not be the one.
But in my opinion you are talking about problems so far ahead in the future. What happening now is public acceptance. Think of it when people are scared of putting their info in friendster &amp; myspace.. Think of Early early stage of myspace. We are in that stage.
One day will come where majority of the people are comfortable with the idea and start using them. By then we will start selecting which cryptocurrency that suits our needs. Then natural selections will begin and we will have our "facebook"... And maybe a "Linkdin" (for specific purpose)
Again this is just my opinion
@_date: 2013-12-16 18:27:52
The middleman argument was weird...  Is he talking about bitcoin, or all types of currency in general?
@_date: 2013-12-16 18:03:40
Well it still just rumors... So.. Well most of the articles are like these:
Not really reliable, but i guess the only reliable source for this one is tim cook himself.
Basically most of the articles says this: apple knows your credit card (itunes), knows where you are (apple map), knows in which room you are (ibeacon), knows that it IS in fact you (fingerprint)....  So, hnmmm (then they start speculating)
@_date: 2013-12-20 07:08:22
I was joking in my first sentence, sorry if I didn't word it properly
But C'mon, kid looks happy, daddy sounds proud... Ah well
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:29:55
I don't understand with this sub,
So The price drop. It is good news! Buy! Buy! But in proper percentage of your total portfolio.
This means you will have more bitcoins when the price hit 5000 or even 10000.
If you dont have cash with you, sit back and relax
Guys, if you want to invest, have investor mentality..
@_date: 2013-12-24 03:43:50
It's not for their generation
Just as credit cards &amp; emails are not for generation before them.
@_date: 2013-12-19 01:08:15
Yeah sorry, my wording is wrong.
I did introduce bitcoin to some colleagues, but i always told them don't jump in because the price was rising, but because you love the idea of bitcoin (unregulated, etc.) 
 And that they need to educate themselves first. 
And when some of  them don't agree with the idea of bitcoin, i respect their opinion.

Maintain your position =/= "if I keep on gambling, i might won back my money"
Oh, and it is stupid to gamble. The house always win. Always.
@_date: 2013-03-31 11:43:04
Hi! Im like you but few steps behind.. As in: I also invest in precious metal but not yet on bitcoin. just downloaded the wallet and haven't bought any bitcoins.. From which website did you choose to buy your coins?
@_date: 2013-12-20 02:12:16
Well, the kid has his own small business... I guess most of us don't.
Anyhow, look at the pic. Kid looked happy and proud... That's what matters..a proof that (mom n) dad did a good job.
@_date: 2013-12-16 14:47:31
I read about this in some other articles.
It is not just introducing another way of payment... It's trying to be the most convenient way of making payment.
 Basically apple wants to charge brick n mortars retailers just as apple charges artists in itunes &amp; app developers in appstore.
I don't think this will be popular though.. Unless maybe if apple take its percentage from credit card company, and not from the retailer's profit.
And I don't think this will affect much on bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 14:10:51
I start investing like... 5% of my total savings... Currently became 40% of my savings
