Yeah I cashed out a ton of BTC to cover my initial investment in BTC ... I could have like 30 extra BTC right now ... No regrets though because wherever this takes me it cost me nothing and is infinitely better than any video game I've ever played ... I also was forced to learn a lot about the markets and trading and the economy. If it crashed tomorrow I'd still be a better person from this wild ass ride ...

I made an initial investment of 4 BTC, through satoshi dice I've managed to turn that into 33 BTC (spent 13 BTC on various items) and I've still got 20 BTC left. Gambling is OK if you know when to stop, you also need to know when to just take the loss and step away.
I've always been good at gambling though but never really made so much money as I have on satoshi dice. In Vegas and on cruise ships I always manage to be up about $300 then I just stop, spend it on a lavish dinner or a show and consider it a successful trip. Some people are always chasing though thinking they can get back their losses or they get greedy and won't stop thinking they can make more money.
I will always remember though how I lost $60 on roulette in about 3 minutes at the casino near my house. That's when I stopped going there ... I have not been back since but that is the only time I've ever actually lost at gambling.

BTC as an investment is not really a good idea. BTC is a currency, 'investing' in it's like buying Euro's and hoping that the dollar crashes so you can have more dollars ...
To answer your question, in 1 month I have made about $2900 dollars from a $190 investment. I've spent 13 BTC and cashed out 9 BTC to cover my initial investment and clear about $300 USD cash profits. I have 20.3 left in my wallet at this moment that is worth almost $2000 USD.
This has been done through a combination of buying low, selling high and satoshi dice.
I would not reccomend this method to anyone as it is very risky and I am super lucky to have come out on top.
I plan to use BTC as a currency and I'm not holding out hope that I will hoard it and it will be worth 5k a coin one day.
If I do not spend it, It will never grow beyond what it is right now because of that mentality.
I'd reccomend you buy in as much as you can afford to lose and then explore all the things you can do with it. Be careful about gambling and short selling or you will be dissapointed. Instead check out bitcoinstore and bitmit and such things, maybe hold onto your BTC until the price settles, in the mean time offer goods and services that someone might want in exchange for BTC.
@_date: 2013-03-21 18:13:24
Because if everyone just invests and holds then ultimatley the currency is worth nothing.

I used to win hardcore at satoshi dice, I was up to 77 BTC from 3 BTC. I lost 24 BTC in one day (before the 'crash') and decided to look at how much 24 BTC was actually worth in dollars. Ouch. 
I felt like a tool but convinced myself 'it's free money I'm still on top' so right during the crash I sent all my BTC to 50% and won, cashed out enough BTC to cover my seed money and never played another game. Never will either because I saw this little demon inside me for the first time that was so wreckless and I've always been very calculating even if I usually take huge risks. Those simulations were exactly what was going to happen to me. I barely came out on top, I would advise anyone to stay away from gambling because it's a very slippery slope chasing that one loss all the way down. I can't imagine telling my wife I lost 8 grand on the internet especially when we just got rid of 28,000 in debt over the last 6 years we've been married.

This could be someone pumping the market to dump during the chaos that will surely ensue on Monday when the American banks open and people dump at an all-time high. I'm really not sure what is going on but it's not the usual ... hope it heads upwards though. I bought 5k USD worth of BTC at 133 and I won't even get credited until Tuesday ... I'm starting vacation tomorrow and promised myself I wouldn't watch the price while on vacation ... Might have to break that promise. I was hoping for some stability ... guess that was to much to ask for.

I'm still using coinbase. I got lucky and bought 37.6 BTC around 2100 EDT a few days ago .... They seem to have more coin available during the night and at random hours. I think it's all based on when Fred wakes up to start the day.
I love coinbase because of the direct integration with my bank account and no transfer fees for anything. Also back when the price for BTC was  $28 coinbase was really fast and reliable. They grew so fast now though that things are slow and transactions sometimes take hours to post but I'm still sticking with them.

There might be a problem due to finance laws. When you donate BTC say, $100 it might be worth $45 or $1000. It's the same reason you can't donate your car to Rand, or give him stock in a company.

One of the big things about prosecuting banks people fail to realize is a lot of people (myself included) have investment accounts with these banks. You start seizing their assets, people stop receiving their retirement money ... you ruin 401k's and starve my grandad. It's much easier to never let people see how insecure your retirement really is. Think about it like this too ... all this debate over Obamacare and how the system only works if everyone buys in ... if we take our money out of the banks and use bitcoin as our retirement they can't keep generating capital to keep paying their retirees. It only works if they have your money to loan and reap capital on investments and mortgages. It only works if everyone buys in. They are not going to come out and say that though because the market only works if people believe paper or a mineral or a hash has value. The only thing if real value in this world is fresh water, food and shelter but we use money to purchase those things ... thus it has its value.
You think these judges and senators don't have investments in these banks? They sieze 6 billion dollars from liberty reserve, no big deal because it's all 'criminals' and average Joes money. You start prosecuting HSBC people start dying in the street because they have no money to pay rent or buy food.

Coinbase let me go negative one during their issues. I was like fuck this I quit and threw all my btc at satoshi dice in 2 to 3 BTC increments I actually ended up betting 2.3 more BTC than I had in the account because of the lag. They all came back winners on the 48% and I quadrupled my BTC holdings but didn't find out for like 2 days. I even got back the winning on the coin I didn't actually own! Since then I've been very patient with coinbase, their bugs actually paid off for me.

This is why I wanted to be very transparent as far as giving my true identity thus opening myself up to legal action if I did run afoul of a client.
I'm still hesitant to really out myself and my personal details but I think it would go a long way towards building trust. It would be easier to call the cops on me for stealing from you than it would be to call them on some guy you met on craigslist who gave you a disposable email or phone number.

I thought this too until I did some research. LTC is actually more secure than Bitcoin because it would take 24 blocks to double spend as opposed to 6 blocks for BTC. The chances of someone getting 24 in a row are less than someone getting 6 in a row. 
Also the coin that got 51% was FTC.

Today I was considering a $2500 coin buy ... I'm still a little gun shy after almost losing $8000 during the correction. I'll sit it out until wednesday and see what happens with the market before I invest another huge chunk like that.
I was able to recover what I had invested by doing a 'hail mary' (pretty much the stupidest and most risky thing one could do at the time) I sent 47 BTC that I had bought at $239 to Satoshi Dice 50% and it came back as a win, so I cashed out the winnings and a little bit of my coin hoard at $120 and broke even ... I've still got my coin hoard (slightly dented) and I bought a bunch of shit on bitcoinstore and sold some to a gentleman in Toronto while I was on 'vacation' ... overall it's been absolutley wild and I'm enjoying this relative stability.
@_date: 2013-05-30 16:31:34
I think I will have to listen to your advice. I have a large reserve of BTC set aside for liability purposes but if someone wanted to push through a 1000 BTC order and the price went down 75% I might not be able to meet my guarantee. 
I'll have to grow my reserve fund until I can meet a certain criteria before offering that service. Do you think being able to cover 2000 BTC transaction with a 75% decline in price would be a reasonable amount of insurance?
I could post the address so people can verify the balance on blockchain.info? Would that put some fears to rest or is that just being stupid?

I think they got off easy with $50!
I could have sold the same coin over and over and over again for almost a grand every 24 hours. Wonder how long until they caught on? Haha but I told them up front about it and they let me keep $50 that they had overpaid me and just took the rest of the money back out via debit.

I put this in a waiting area that sees a ton of traffic. We have more than 200+ 18-36 year olds a week who have to wait for various things. Almost all of them are tech savvy and have mobile devices.
This often their last stop before disseminating to other parts of the world (US Navy ships). They have a lot of spare time to look up bitcoin on their phones if they don't already know about it. Those that do will most likely use it just for the novelty.
It's already turned some heads and today was dead as hell. I had a woman ask me about it and she sounded really interested. Also my co-workers are super curious and asking me to help get them started in trading bitcoins. 
I can't wait until next week when we will have the perfect storm of people converging in that waiting area. We are expecting about 200+ a day spending at least 3 hours there. I've stocked up on K-cups and can't wait to see what happens. It should be very interesting.

With all of the things I've been seeing about bitcoin in Argentina I am seriously considering going there for my annual Christmas vacation, the weather ought to be nice in December right?
I was going to go on a cruise but I would love to spend some BTC and of course my USD in Argentina!

Hey MtGox, you need a public affairs guy desperately. If you are in the market (and you should be) I'll do it for 0.01 BTC a day. This is a problem I've noticed with a couple Bitcoin companies like BFL and Gox. These guys seem like total amateurs when it comes to public relations. Your consumer base is very tech savvy, very smart and not very trusting of institutions or we wouldn't be involved in Bitcoin in the first place. Silence is the worst thing you can do to people like us. We fill in the blank with assumptions and theories. Real companies publish earning reports and have entire teams dedicated to image. They are honest (to a point) because they are accountable to their investors. Even though you are accountable to no one (yet) you should at least pretend you are in the big time and a legitimate business. Just tell the truth (or at least break it to us softly) I'd venture to say that most consumers nowadays are willing to forgive a lot and work with you if you are honest with them. We don't want you to be all corporate with us but you would gain a lot of respect if you talked to us like normal human beings. You would not have all this trouble, there would be no need for petitions and law suits. We are the future of consumers, it's time to get with the times on customer relations.
Edit: Coinbase seems to be the exception, I got so carried away with the negative I forgot to mention the positive.

There is a flaw in your logic my friend.
If you could double spend your coins at will then why would you want 50 BTC? Furthermore if you are such a genius that you found this exploit then why would you want more of this 'doomed' currency? Wouldn't some other genius find this exploit and then the currency would crash anyways?

I've thought about the idea of starting a bitcoin concierge service where you post a bounty and can tip for excellent service. Like say you wanted and would kill for tickets to a sold out concert or show, I'm pretty good at sweet talking and back dooring and downright deceiving people to get stuff like that. I also have a concierge service on my platinum card that is free I could just subcontract stuff like that out and still get paid for it. It would be minimal effort and all profit with no overhead.

Coinbase has rewarded me at least $70 worth of BTC for finding bugs (on accident). They've been very generous and honest in their dealings with me. 
Especially considering that one of the bugs I found was basically due to me using their API to spam thousands of small transactions to Satoshi Dice. I'm sure I've created one or two nightmares for their staff by stress testing things. I also created a double spend somehow that took months to resolve.
@_date: 2013-05-28 08:40:59
It's becoming harder and harder to get money into bitcoin ... I'm wondering if this is the 'then they fight you' stage.
@_date: 2013-04-24 15:47:11
Think about it like this, I bought the coin at $60 ... so technically I actually paid much less than I would have with fiat.
It's win win for both of us ...
What I paid 18 BTC for would have cost 30 BTC when I bought it! So essentially I got it for almost a 50% discount over fiat and now he has 40% more value than what I paid for it!
People always forget that aspect of it all.

I love coinbase.com. It's really easy to attach a bank account to them.

I bought in before this massive surge, I let my bitcoin appreciate then cashed out just enough to cover my initial investment. After I.did that I felt free to spend and use my bitcoin, I hit up the dice and other stuff to get BTC to spend on bitmit and bitcoin store. Every little thing I buy with BTC is a treat for me because as far as I'm concerned it's free money. Now I have a lot of cool shit. I don't feel bad spending $30 with of bitcoin on something then having that BTC turn into $60 the next day. I'm helping other people and getting free stuff in return. I've had to catch myself getting greedy and treating BTC like 'the precious' but I keep reminding myself that one day this could all be worth thousands or nothing at all so hoarding it and speculation are worthless. Save some, spend the rest and get what you want out of BTC. I had fallen into the greed trap but then stopped and asked myself when will it be enough? When I have $6000 or will it be $17000 ? The answer was disturbing to me, it would never be enough. When the object becomes to make money and hoard it just for the sake of making more money then you are missing out on life and no better than those greedy wall street bankers you so hate.

A lot of people are offended by that term.
I bought into BTC not to make a quick dollar, but because I believe it in as a currency and want to see it flourish. 
I've spent more BTC than a majority of people have ever even owned. People would call me an idiot for that but it's people like me that are going to drive adoption, not people who are hoarding and treating it like a stock trying to make a quick buck.
It's funny it just occurred to me how I am the consumer and now they are the fat cat banker that relies on me to keep spending for the value of their holdings to increase.
People like to hate on the 1% but when given the chance they blindly become the 1%.

It's weird watching peoples brains work. They see a big number like $200 and then it gets to like $205 and then it goes to $202 and they think 'oh fuck man, this is it, oh shit! sell sell sell!' 
Then people that were wishing they had bought more at $200 see it hit $200 and buy in and it's back to $205 ...
The weak hands are sitting there looking at the screen thinking 'maybe I should buy back in before it gets too high' ...
Today begins my vacation, around 9AM EDT I'm leaving to Canada for a week. I'm not going to check the price. I'm glad I got to see it hit $200 this morning and I hope that by the time I check back in next Saturday we are at least around the same price.
Good luck while I am gone and don't do anything stupid to break the market until I get back.

I would actually really like to hear your scenario, especially if it could prevent me from making the same mistakes in the future.
I have not received an official blessing from my lawyer on the wording of the dispute process but a general overview of it (not final product) is that in the event of a dispute between buyer and seller my wife and I would act as the investigating parties, by using the service you would have to agree that in case of a dispute you are obligated to provide us requested evidence that may include personal information, a reasonable amount of time will be allotted for you to provide the requested evidence/information. Failure to provide requested information will only damage your case. There will be no split rewards unless both parties agree upon a new price. Disputes due to exchange rate disparities will not be entertained, for instance someone buys a game from you for 1 BTC and the price drops to 14$ a coin we won't entertain the dispute unless both parties agree to a new price, if both parties don't agree then it's case closed and the BTC is sent to the receiving party. There will be no charge outside of the agreed upon escrow fee for dispute resolution. The goal is to act as a neutral party and gather information, objective measurable information and make an informed decision.
My goal is to be quick, I don't want to drag it out.

That would be regulation. Also if you started blacklists who's to say you won't end up on one? If they destroyed every dollar that was used in a crime we'd have no money left. I read somewhere that nearly every dollar in the US has cocaine residue on it. Not sure if true but it wouldn't surprise me.

I'm trying to talk a weapons manufacturer into accepting btc at the moment. Even if it starts out manually once they have some btc I'm sure they will like how the value appreciated. They sell it to me for a price and a week later is actually more money than what they sold it for. That's how you hook them.
@_date: 2013-04-22 16:53:54
I wonder what implications this would have for bitcoin if any?
 
It would definitely invite further regulation to virtual currencies, if people started using bitcoin more to avoid paying taxes for goods and services they would eventually pass a law saying that virtual currencies had to be taxed as well.

Consensus decision making is an awful thing.
Take for instance Occupy Wall Street, no one ever comes to a consensus when they were using their magical feelers 'hot and cold'.
So you say let the majority rule? That's how we end up with Obama and Hitler ...
If the majority ruled their would be no gay marriage because the majority are still against it.
Consensus is nice but there has to be systems built on top of it like the 'electoral college' otherwise the will of the majority is always going to trample the minority.
There has to be checks and balances like the Supreme Court to balance the Executive and Legislative branch.
Edit: Remember Human beings are fearful creatures and if consensus was allowed to rule there would never be any progress because people fear change.

When I first jumped on coinbase in February it was instantaneous ... this is not the service I had come to expect of them.
When they claimed they had it fixed I was like OK and it worked awesome for about 6 hours then around midnight on the 22nd of March it crashed hard and has been fucked up for days now. 
I'm really upset with them and tried to jump ship and transfer it all to my computers bitcoin address and that transaction has been pending for 2 days now.

lalicat was in a cave, looking for treasure. He found an old lamp, rubbed it, and a genie came out. The genie said "I will grant you three wishes, but your ex-wife will get double." lalicat agreed, and said "I wish I had a mansion." The genie granted it, and his ex-wife got two mansions. lalicat said "I would like a million satoshis." The genie again granted it and his ex-wife got two million satoshis. Then lalicat said, "Scare me half to death."

I have a sweet ass gaming rig and only get about 566Mhs. I'm part of triplemining.com and I rake in about 0.1 BTC a day. It's not much at all. I did the math and from like the 16th until now I've raked in about $40 USD.
I mine pretty much all the time except for the 3 hours a day that I am playing Battlefield 3.
I'm using an ATI HD 7970. It's about a $300 video card (was $600 when I bought it). 
I would not invest the $1500 into mining equipment. I would instead invest it in BTC.

The same thing was posted for April 1st anyone remember? 
This reminds me of what I used to do when I was a teenager on the internet back in the days of AOL. I used to crack passwords of guide accounts and phish for passwords to sign up for the AOL phone cards then sell them to my friends, then started 'carding' just bought laptops and video games ... graduated to making my own Trojans to steal passwords and billing information ... I'm not sure exactly what happened but I grew a conscience and stopped being an asshole. 
I see now I was a super troll before trolling was a thing ... this will always exist on the internet, it's the new juvenile delinquency. I admit it was fun as hell and I look back on that time in my life fondly regardless of the people I hurt.
My only hope is that these people grow up and realize that they are trying to destroy something beautiful and if they bought in and used their skills for something constructive they could really add to the community instead of wrecking it for everyone else. 
It's sad really. Still I don't believe much will come of this 'attack'.

I've got like 32 BTC just hanging out in 'coinbase space' unable to even send to another account or anything.

I was so desperate to buy coin the other day I was actually considering checking the box on coinbase allowing like 6 days to purchase at market price (it would not actually purchase till tomorrow night) this was when bitcoin was at $130 if I had checked the little box I'd be out about 2.5k returns on the initial 5k purchase. Luckily I refreshed and suddenly coins were available.

Basically yes. There is a script out there though that checks to see when coin is available to buy (because of their rolling limit). It would be nice to be able to set up options like that but I'm more of a buy and let appreciate for a minute then spend it on bitcoinstore and bitmit. I love collecting shit. I'm not a speculator at all but it would be a fun side game you know?

I'm waiting for a $5,006 purchase to clear from coinbase. I like them, I know they've had their issues but the tech support has always been good to me.
If they kicked back my $5k purchase especially after I've already bought more than $200 from them in the past I would be livid and that would be the last straw.
I guess I'll find out on the 10th of April.
@_date: 2013-05-30 15:10:41
My thought on doing it like that is that sometimes people need money to pay for set expenses. You might sell your Xbox360 for Bitcoin because you need to pay your phone bill. If you are getting a guaranteed amount knowing the price won't fluctuate and you won't have to cut into your other budget might give some people peace of mind. 
I would like to know why you think it's not a good feature? I welcome criticism especially if it can help me avoid a potential mistake.

There was already a huge increase in the price of LTC as soon as the news was announced.
The reasons are: 
Bringing LTC to gox opens up a huge amount of new money into LTC - even if it's just people holding their BTC on gox they can now convert it to LTC if they wanted.
It gives some legitimacy to LTC that is still lacking, having it traded on gox means it's made the 'big time' so to speak.
The biggest  reason people are missing is - merchant tools.
When gox implements LTC trading the merchant tools come along with it. Suddenly you can use LTC to buy things ...
If you are a merchant what will it hurt to add LTC to your website already accepting BTC?
This will open up the world to LTC and that is the true value of being traded on gox. People want money and they don't care if they are getting it in LTC or BTC - especially if they've already made the leap of accepting crypto-currencies for their business so I would expect widespread adoption.
Once LTC is trading on gox it's going to be impossible to put back in the box. Impossible to ignore as a crypto-currency. I love BTC and believe in BTC but I also realize that LTC is gaining legitimacy despite BTC.
I'm not ready to declare a new king of crypto, however - what came first? Myspace or Facebook? HD DVD or Blu Ray?
Often times it's the second iteration of an idea that takes hold because it's been refined.
We'll see. Either way I support crypto-currency and competition is always a good thing because it creates a reason to improve.
 
@_date: 2013-04-30 07:59:23

It would be an option you could use free of charge. I'd make up the difference out of pocket.
The reason it would be free of charge is because if the price goes up, you still get only the coin equaling the agreed upon USD amount. I would pocket the rest. 
I could consider making an 'insured option' where if the price goes down I make up the difference but if the price goes up or stays the same you get exactly the amount of coin agreed upon ... and just set the insured fee at 0.27%. How would you feel about that?

I made a purchase on ebay yesterday with bitcoins and it left a lot to be desired as far as security. Thankfully the seller was a trustworthy guy, if BTC were integrated into paypal it would be wonderful to be able to offer that security and consumer protection.
Still kind of sucks for the seller because ebay still took $200 in fees just for the listing and the price of the auction ... but in order to get mainstream people you need simplicity - plus they are used to the fees anyways.

Well the site caught up in a big way. To further highlight my lack of understanding of bitcoin when the transactions started to trickle in I thought it was simply refunding some bets I made to satoshi dice so I simply re-made the bets. It turns out those coins coming back were actually wins catching up from small bets i had made earlier and I bet all my winnings again and again and somehow managed to win on the 50% four times in a row. I quadrupled by bitcoin holdings out of ignorance and could have potentially lost over one thousand dollars. All is well that ends well. I'm just going to go ahead and stop messing with my account now.

On the positive side, these people that bought in at $200 are less likely to sell for quite some time, this seems to add some stability the higher the price goes and the more that they buy up from the people who are selling to make profits.

I've bought loads of shit with BTC. Before the 'crash' everyone thought I was stupid for spending it but I was buying stuff when the price was over 200 and getting excellent value. I basically got a ton of shit for free. Recently I bought a mining rig from a fellow redditor with BTC.

One thing I've realized no matter how bad life is right now, everything you've lost is nothing compared to everything you stand to gain in the next few years. I was in a very bad place after Iraq I had PTSD and didn't know it I was destroying my life and all of my relationships. I locked myself in a closet for 5 days with amphetamines and alcohol to the point where I was delusional and suicidal .... 8 years later I'm the happiest I've ever been, I'm married, make great money, have lots of friends and 2 beautiful daughters. Every single day is better than the last. I never thought it was possible. Please get help and don't do anything stupid. You never know how fast your life can change for the better. Remember it's always darkest before the dawn.

Their customer service is excellent for merchants. If you are just a trader and don't have a merchant set up they take their time helping you because you are not their big money accounts.
They've gotten infinitely better at customer service though in the last few months.
I've created a lot of problems for coinbase, back in the early days I created a script using their API to spam satoshi dice and crashed their shit for like 2 days. I was also able to sell coins that I technically didn't own after I crashed their back end server with my spamming. I also created a double spend and that took months for them to fix but for my troubles and honesty they have rewarded me more than $70 for finding bugs in their system.
They've only ended up actually owing me money once and when I brought it up they corrected it and credited me immediately. 
They are still in beta but I can't say enough good things about them. If they do manage to fuck something up they take responsibility and are not shy about refunding you.
@_date: 2013-04-27 01:09:44
You fail to realize that all of you 99% who hate the banks and hate the man are actually the man. You hold your BTC in hopes the price will go up and the price is driven by people adopting and spending BTC, trading it with one another. You feel a little spark of glee everytime you see a article that includes another company trading in BTC.
You are those assholes you claim to hate, you've become them by chance and now you will deny that's what you've become. You live on the backs of those who spend (like me) because you want to keep your precious BTC and not spend it and are just waiting on the chance to sell out and sell your fellow believers out when it reaches a 'peak'.
You have literally become everything you claim to hate. What's worse is that you will look at yourself in the mirror and say 'so what, I didn't sell out, I bought in' and you will justify it.
I just want you guys to realize, really think about it, you've become the scum you hated.

There was a supposed pump &amp; dump with a DDOS attack on the major exchanges that was allegedly supposed to go down today. I doubt it will. People are just seeding uncertainty in the hopes of snatching up bitcoin from the weak hands that panic sell.
Truth be told if I see it go below 80 again I'm going to buy with the fury of 1000 suns.
I spent about 13 BTC on various items in bitmit and bitcoinstore that are arriving this week and I'm super stoked to be able to buy more coins at a bargain to replace what I've spent.

I have been investing in my retirement for the last 10 years through my IRA. I'm on track to have $3 million in retirement if I live to be 65 and retire from my first career at 39. 
I could stop working at 39 and still retire. I think it's a little crazy to think that bitcoin is going to fund anyones retirement (besides the guys who are now bitcoin millionaires) but getting in at this stage is hardly going to supplement someones income enough to retire (in my opinion). 
If you are in bitcoin right now speculating hoping to fund your retirement I think you may end up like that greedy old and busted fellow you speak of.

I like it, except I think that might be a little too high for a 25% profit but then again I'm the consumer I'll always want better odds.

Also when it was for credit only, there was no such thing as a debit card? Now look around you, it's everywhere. You carry your wallet in your cellphone just scan and send. The verification and security will keep on evolving until the point that it will be instant and everywhere. This is in its infancy still.

I've been working towards getting this coded to automate the process as this is my ideal scenario but I'm having difficulty taking advantage of this. I've considered not going live until I can figure this out so that they don't really have to trust me with access to the funds ... I don't want to have to do all of this manually, that leaves room for error.
Edit: Forgot to add that the reason I went with this method was to do the 'lock-in price' escrow. Now that I am seriously reconsidering that feature I would not have to have access to the funds at all.

I've been a conservative all my life. I know that does not fly here on reddit. I always believed that no matter what if you were in the right time at the right place and made your millions then you earned them and deserved to keep them. If your parents did all the work and you inherited all of their hard work then you deserve to keep it because we all desire to do the same for our children. I believe all of this despite being homeless as a child. I do very very well as an adult but it's because my parents got their shit together and dug us out of poverty and I'm infinitely better off because of their hard work and what they passed on to me in terms of wealth and work ethic. Despite the fact I've got a lot more money because of bitcoin nowadays I was already in a good spot to begin with. People will always be jealous, being a liberal is all about jealousy as was occupy wallstreet. It's all about I want what you have because I missed the bus and I blame society. 
To all the newly minted rich I say, be proud of your foresight and remember fortune favors the bold. You could have played it safe and missed your chance but you didn't. That in itself puts you head and shoulders above your peers and is in keeping with the bold attitudes that founded this wonderful country and continues to bring bold and intrepid souls to our shores to seek a better life. 
Even if you're not an American you are recapturing that spirit that made individuals great, it's the willingness to take a chance and stay the course despite the naysayers ... 'it's a bubble' 'it's not even money' 'you're wasting your time' 'why don't you just focus on the real world' they live to discourage you because they're afraid to live at all.

They would take that out on the store owners requiring them to have positive ID before selling to anyone. Just like they do the exchanges ... think about it.

You would be surprised how many of us are young, successful professionals who don't have the time to go to the rallys but make time to go to the town hall meetings. If you go to a Tea Party town hall meeting is a whole different crowd. We actually joke that the only people that have time to go to a rally or protest are the retired and the disabled.

Good luck with that!' people don't really see the 'you get change back' aspect of it upon first glance. They forget that a dollar is made out of cents.

If I had a billion Chinamen with calculators I could pull off a decent hash rate.

What the fuck, that's an amazing bundle. Wow! I actually play all of those games.
I'm going to make it worth their effort today haha :)

0600-1530 with a half hour in wherever I can get it for lunch. Monday through Friday. These are sweet ass shore duty hours.

I would definitely pay for this. My car stereo integrates with Pandora via Bluetooth and I've not listened to the 'radio' in more than a year. I use Pandora daily for about an hour on my commute to and from work.

I'm not an expert at mining by any measure but I have a kick ass gaming rig and pull about 566Mhs. I jumped into slushes mining pool and in about 3 days of non stop mining I had gotten 0.15 BTC.
I hopped into a different mining pool triplemining.com and while the payouts are less frequent I can pull 0.3 every 2 or 3 days with a chance to win the jackpot of 0.4 every week. I only mine when I am at work and overnight and not using it to play video games after work (about 3 hours a day).
I use the money from mining in satoshi dice and have managed to quadruple my initial investment. I have not put any money into bitcoin since February but still just kept using my profit from mining to gamble with. 
It's nice when you have a significant amount of bitcoin to watch the price go up to 60USD and basically watch your money skyrocket. I've made about $160 from yesterday night until this morning with the price soaring.

Yeah if you live near a college campus :) haha, now that is a way to make some real money!

I just sent them the e-mail, we'll see how long it takes their tech support to get back to me. Thanks for making me feel better about doing this guys! I really appreciate it!

I suppose I could have.

I've been loading up my BTC-e account with litecoin mining to convert to BTC transfer to gox and sell at a profit but my LTC only generates 1 BTC every 10 days ... needless to say I'm not making much of a difference. The problem is getting money into the other exchanges to take advantage.

I was looking at the FPGA's that did exist, if you are not worried about power consumption and just looking for pure hashing power then you could consider looking for some higher end GPU like the HD 7970. 
I have an HD 7970 (for gaming) and when I mine I get about 650 M hash
It's quite comparable to the FPGA and actually cheaper (now) because people are trying to sell their FPGA for $1200 and up to try and recoup the investment they made.

I'm curious to know how this model stands up to recent inventions like the smartphone and tablets? 
It seems like the early majority is happening earlier and earlier. They are still trying to figure out all the things we can do with smartphones and thinking of new shit every day.
Also with 3DTV, DVR, Flat screen monitors and TV's ... Touchscreens - innovation comes so fast nowadays we don't even realize it. The cell phone crept into American society quite slowly compared to the internet but quite quickly compared to television. It's crazy to realize that a very select few people had heard of facebook in 2007. I remember when you still had to pick what university you had or were attending just to sign up for it, now look at it. 
If you really stop and think about it, it's amazing how fast things have changed. I remember hearing about youtube from some kid I was teaching in 2006. It seems like yesterday ...

I don't trust them. I've already pulled my seed money from the market because I don't trust anyone not to manipulate the currency. If I were greedy I would have kept it in hoping to make more and more but I've got a wife and kids. Now my bitcoin holdings are purely the interest that was generated on my seed money. Yeah it cut my holdings in half but who's to say it won't double or triple now with no risk to me?
