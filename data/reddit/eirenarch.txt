Are you sure your bank balance will be converted? Because I don't think this is how it works. I think only your pension and salary will be converted. Of course the government can mandate some strange form of nationalization of bank accounts through conversion but my understanding is that Greece doesn't want to do that and in any case the government should be worried about their physical safety if they tried.

How does it exclude my vote? I have the chance to vote for Paul and I lose and I am given the chance to give my opinion on the top 2 candidates. I think Trump is much better than Sanders so I vote for Trump. I don't see where my incentive not to vote lies.

I don't see how the fact that socialism can be democratic (in fact current democracies tend to lean left because everyone can vote as opposed to only people who pay taxes/own land can vote) goes against point. Even if the majority chooses socialism democratically they still force the rest to participate in their social system via the barrel of a government gun. I mean capitalism gives them the option to create a socialist company and redistribute the wealth as they see fit between the members/employees of the socialist company but they do not do that. They want to force everyone to participate.

Only people who pay taxes should be allowed to vote. If you are employed by the government you don't vote either.
@_date: 2015-06-21 11:58:39
I understand how democracy works. What I am saying is that capitalism is freedom while socialism is forcing people to do what the majority (or the powers that be in non-democratic socialism) wants. As I said a communist in a capitalist country is free to build his commune and establish communist rule there and live with other communists. A capitalist in socialist world must obey the socialist laws, pay taxes for people he does not wish to associate with, negotiate with unions, etc.

Highly unlikely to happen in Europe. Europe (especially Germany) has very strong economy to back the Euro. Can swallow any bank run. Of course there are things worse than bank runs but panic by normal people in Spain and Italy is unlikely to destroy the Euro.

Depends on your skills. With IT job you can make a decent living. There are other marketable skills (lawyers, running a business) but I doubt they will be a good fit for foreigners. Overall I would advise against that idea. There is a certain appeal to have your kids grow in somewhat tougher and more free environment (supposedly they would grow stronger and more independent) but there are things that certainly offset this like very bad health care. Also I don't know if you will be able to handle the culture shock. Your wife may also have a problem if she's been away for a while.

IE is really the best browser for touch on Windows. If you have a Windows machine with touch you should really try it. Now obviously Windows machines with touch are in general the new ultrabooks and convertibles and not many people bought them but those who did usually love them. Note that I am not talking about Metro mode IE (although it is true for it as well) but very regular desktop IE. Things like scrolling and zooming with touch are very smooth and satisfying. The only thing on Windows that comes close is Chrome. Firefox and Opera are just tragic. I think they treat touch as a mouse. Chrome is relatively good but IE is obviously better with more natural "physics" and things like rubber bands. I think I will never buy a portable (ultrabook/laptop) device without touch again and I think the main reason is IE. Also Apple are lying to you - MacBook Air will be much better with touch if they just admit it and implement it.

In my opinion the inflation should be very small and constant. People will not spend money if they have more than what is enough for their needs if there is no inflation. Ideally money should invested or borrowed if not used to buy things you want.
@_date: 2014-07-05 19:39:58

Well there are some gotchas
1) The version that is open sourced is not released yet.
2) The version that is open sourced is not fully compatible with the existing framework and the existing framework will continue to be developed. The stuff that is removed is mostly stuff people didn't like anyway and it makes the new version cleaner and faster but the full framework will continue to exist for backward compatibility
3) The part that is open sourced is the web stack and does not include technologies for making desktop apps like WPF and Windows Forms (for now).

The USA has a problem with the state providing monopoly to their providers by regulating who can put cables in the ground and in the air. This is the only reason they have problems with monopoly providers. Even then I see no reason why providers should provide access to incredibly costly Netflix.

I believe that the market solves all serious problems (including monopolies) in the absence of government regulation.

Obviously in the current situation there are problems with scaling. One side believes that the current devs are unable to solve the problem (or unwilling) and are willing to take the risk to try to scale it by increasing the block size even if it is risky.
@_date: 2017-03-19 13:30:25
And what happens with 1MB blocks today and how many percent of the mining done in China?
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:57:56
I don't know why the stupid 2MBs weren't approved last year. It certainly can work because increasing the blocksize has worked in the past. The people who were so worried about decentralization could have admitted that they do not have solution today and given themselves more time for the Lightening Network to arrive. I mean it is an increase to 2MB not unbound blocksize.
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:25:44

@_date: 2017-03-13 14:30:27
And this happened because blocks were too big?
@_date: 2017-03-03 11:28:44
I was thinking of buying when it was $30 and I thought that it might reach like $100 so I wanted to invest a hundred dollars in like 3 BTC. However at the time it was hard to buy (at least where I live and with my banks) and I decided that the trouble isn't worth it for that small of an investment and I wasn't ready to invest more. Too bad I was so lazy :( I later bought 1BTC at around $600 and later saw it fall to $200 but kept hodling.
@_date: 2017-03-18 20:10:44
Because as pointed out nobody has proposed blocksize increase which is not a hard fork (and no, SegWit does not count). In addition hard fork of this type has been done before.
@_date: 2017-03-19 12:54:11
Which will reduce the number of full nodes and destroy trust in BTC and therefore the price which is against the interests of the miners.

I wouldn't phrase it like that - more like I decided that the people who censor and ddos those who disagree cannot be the good guys. I don't see why I should be ashamed. I don't even comment much on the topic other than when I see someone claim there was no censorship or when they claim that there should be censorship (like now). The only thing I do is run a full node. I don't even know if I would sell my coins on Core chain if there is a split.
But basically yes I took sides not based on technical arguments. Why should I be ashamed of that?
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:00:56
Nah. I have 19 downloads of the app I just released. There must be at least 19 of us.
@_date: 2017-03-13 11:40:23
Obviously did it too late. I mean we wouldn't have this debate if they had increased the size on time, right? SegWit is complex and couldn't be implemented so fast? Well then maybe an increase to 2MB 2 years ago to give themselves time to implement whatever they think is best would have been appropriate. Surely if the network can work with 1MB blocks it could work with 2MB blocks without the sky falling.

Thanks. You can download it here -

1. Because if it counted there would be no debate. SegWit was always on the roadmap for Core supporters you can't claim that it is a compromise if it is the plan of one side either way.
2. The very word "compromise" means people will agree. Yes, if people don't agree there is no compromise.
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:41:08
Calling SegWit a compromise is quite absurd as it was Core's plan all the way through.
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:10:55
So if SegWit was not in the original plan what was the original plan. Not scaling ever?

My machine (the one running the node) has 8GB of RAM. What is the expected amount of RAM needed for 16MB blocks?
@_date: 2017-03-07 11:26:15
It seems to me that lately the censorship is gone. I however have had pretty mild comments supporting big blocks and even questions deleted in the past. This pushed me to running Full BU node at home and being DDoSed for doing so just motivated me more. I read the arguments and was on the fence but censorship pushed me to support the big blocks.
@_date: 2017-03-08 05:46:28
Yeah, turns out there are no separate permissions for downloading stuff and "acting as a server". Probably an NSA requirement
@_date: 2017-03-13 10:42:37
Core failed. The blocks are full, transactions are delayed, fees are rising. These are the facts. Core had the simple option to increase the block size to 2MB and work on whatever they are working on to scale the network. They did not increase the block size and did not deliver scaling solution - therefore they failed. Maybe BU will fail too, who knows but Core failed for sure.
@_date: 2017-03-13 10:38:56
I don't like centralization but hard drive space is very cheap so I will buy enough decentralization thank you.
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:19:38
May have been so but when the Hong Kong thing happened SegWit was already Core's plan.
@_date: 2017-03-19 11:18:44

If Segwit came with the promised 2MB blocksize increase there would be no opposition.
@_date: 2017-03-19 19:46:29
For starters .NET is open source but more importantly - so what?
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:25:32
The compromise was "increase the blocksize just slightly now (say 2MB instead of 8+MB) and add SegWit later". It even had its own client - Bitcoin Classic. Core and supporters did not accept this compromise.
@_date: 2016-01-17 00:12:14
I am not saying the censorship thing work (although it seems like the DDoS part was successful)
@_date: 2017-03-07 08:42:35
Obviously it is not.
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:39:42
Well I can't see how there could be a compromise on this plan ever. Even the new (SegWit) plan is debatable.
@_date: 2017-03-25 15:18:26
To sum it up it is not that you have observed economic majority behind Core it is that you observe that the economic majority will have trouble adopting BU because the surrounding tools kind of support Core. In addition exchanges did not claim that they would not support BU but that they would reserve the name Bitcoin for Core (those that did claim it anyway). It would be absurd for an exchange not to provide BU trading because at the very least core supporters are expected to sell their BU coins and buy Core coins for which they would need a BU-enabled exchange.

@_date: 2017-03-17 10:18:18
Well I when the Hong Kong thing happened I thought the idea was to increase the base blocksize and add 1MB via SegWit. Maybe I got it wrong and while I getting it wrong doesn't matter how did the miners get it wrong?
@_date: 2017-03-03 11:23:57

Can someone explain how BU leads to more centralization? I asked this question several months ago and got the comment deleted but seeing that censorship is much more relaxed now maybe someone will answer. The explanation I have seen is that it will require more hard drive space and more bandwidth to run a full node but these issues seem unimportant to me since even my 4 years old machine that I use as a backup has 1TB hard drive space and plenty of bandwidth and I just run a full node on the side.

I always use this explanation. I have 30 seconds so I would add "it can be sent through the internet and acquired through "mining" which are operations backed up by solid math which ensures that the end result resembles gold"

My personal view is that hodling Bitcoin is a political statement. Hodling when it crashes is a stronger stance than trading to make a profit.
@_date: 2016-06-10 07:40:30
Does the book require existing blockchain knowledge? Also what level of cryptography knowledge does it require?
@_date: 2017-01-01 22:05:31
Yeah but why are there more sellers there. Why wouldn't they sell at other exchanges? Why isn't anyone buying there (probably automatically) and selling on other exchanges? Now of course provides an answer. If these BTC are related to some criminal activity maybe people want to stay away from them.
@_date: 2017-01-01 18:43:06
I am looking at  and it looks like they average across several exchanges. What I find strange is that this thing BTC-e always lists far lower exchange rate than the others. Why is this the case?
@_date: 2017-01-05 01:06:43
I did not do any research on the story but I would expect that both the buyer and the seller hold non-negligible because they were first adopters. So they are probably not angry at all.
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:06:05
OK then I accept BCH, also ETH and Monero :) As for the plan I meant that I don't know what the plan is for BCH. The point is that it works today and the plan for BTC does not work today. If LN turns out to be great success then fine BCH can just take the code and use it.
@_date: 2017-01-08 12:40:34
I am not selling. Ever. I am not in for the money I am in for the freedom. Now of course I might buy things with the BTC I own directly but the BTC I own will never be exchanged for fiat while I own them.
@_date: 2016-06-13 11:32:08
Bitcoin may be an unwise investment but it is not just an investment. It is a political statement.

@_date: 2017-08-03 18:44:19
However if you do it for political reasons you don't have this problem. I am treating my BTC investment as a political donation. I don't do it for the profit. I do it because it makes the world a better place. Interestingly this strategy has multiplied my investment several times and I don't mind having more money but if BTC goes to zero... well I'll know I tried.
@_date: 2017-08-28 12:07:20
I don't know man... it works for sending value quick and cheap. I got a changetip from some guy, the first time I have seen that in years. The "huge bug" may be a problem for miners and BTC users but for BCH users everything works fine.
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:24:18
How has it failed?
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:10:19
Then sell it but if the market disagrees with your judgement don't blame the guy with the beer :)
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:27:44
So they are 100% sure that this will happen and it will happen with 100% certainty before the price increases further?

I'm in for a Tesla that I will buy with 1 BTC (without selling it for fiat). How much USD for the cheapest Tesla you can buy in Europe?
@_date: 2017-01-01 19:08:07
You could (in fact the exchanges do this for you) but you need to have enough USD to buy the bitcoins of everyone willing to sell under $1000
@_date: 2017-08-12 19:06:33
Technically we're already above $4000 because if you had 1 BTC before the fork the combine price of BTC + BCC is far above $4000
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:28:44
I don't know. I have to assume more people use it compared to BTC with these confirmation times and fees. The change tip bot now works:)
@_date: 2017-08-31 00:29:43
I wonder that too. I actually like the guy a lot other than his Bitcoin bullshit. I also hodl very physical gold (in my house). Just point out that both are not printed by the government and advise people to hedge between both.

No one I know pays with BTC now because of the wait times and fees.
I don't know what the plan is for big scaling. Satoshi's plan to let Moore's law sort things out sounds fine to me. It certainly works up to this point and the other plan does not (if it did we would have LN today)
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:22:42
The disagreement has been resolved by the fork. The fees are what the SegWit side gets.
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:44:40
I agree. When it reaches $10 000 there will be a correction to $7000 for a couple of months.
@_date: 2017-08-31 00:20:25
Why would people sell everything ever? If you have 1000 BTC and you think it won't go up sell 900, make a nice profit and keep some just in case.
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:40:44
It has not failed. It works for sending money over the internet relatively quickly and cheaply.

Trump is right in the sense that if you have a law it should be observed. Otherwise just remove all the laws governing immigration.
@_date: 2015-08-20 13:10:58
Obviously they fall in the category of laws that should be removed. There is absolutely nothing good in having a law that is not enforced. If we do not care if it is enforced we should remove it because it gives unfair advantage to people who break the law. If we care about it we should make sure it is enforced. The current immigration situation in the US is absolutely the worst option - everything is doing illegal things and nobody is trying to stop them.
There is this idea I think coming from ancient Rome (not actually implemented) that breaking each and every law should be punishable by death. If it is not worth punishing something with death then the thing is question is not really important and there should not be laws about it. I kind of agree with the general premise.
@_date: 2015-08-20 13:23:51
I don't live in the USA and we don't have most of these laws but as a matter of fact I did not break any of them today. Of course I have broken some of them at some point.

@_date: 2017-09-02 12:12:46
This is not realistic. Wouldn't that mean that BTC has like 10 times the market cap of gold? 50K though is realistic
@_date: 2017-09-02 21:26:25
Well Gold also has hodlers who aren't selling
@_date: 2017-09-01 18:34:36
I bought BTC during the 2013 rise out of pure fear of missing out. Before that I wanted to buy but was like that guy who didn't install a wallet :) Then Bitcoin crashed hard. I didn't have any problem hodling though because for me hodling BTC was a political position. Now I am approaching at ~9 times return of investment. Still hodling. I will either buy a Tesla car for 1 BTC, see it go to 0 or give it to my children. There is no middle road for me.
@_date: 2017-09-02 15:14:26
21 million coins * $1 000 000 is 21 trillion market cap isn't it? So 3 times the market cap of gold if gold market cap is 7 trillion (I saw higher estimate somewhere)

This is not how it works. If you vote for someone even if he doesn't win or especially if you know he won't win you are giving information to the system that you care deeply about the thing he stands for. Therefore you create an incentive for whoever gets elected to shift his positions slightly towards your position.
@_date: 2015-04-08 08:15:18
OK let me ask you something. Why does it matter what his position on climate change is? I mean what do people who care about climate change expect the US president to do? Go to war with China? Ban import from China? Because the Chinese don't care about climate change and anything anyone does is irrelevant as long as China and India continue to produce CO2.
@_date: 2017-01-04 18:20:31
Sadly it doesn't work this way because of taxes. In the US the price is reported before taxes and the taxes would be different anyway and also as far as I know there are subsidies for electric cars in the US
@_date: 2015-04-21 18:05:51
Because without the right to control your property you can lose control over your body for economic reasons.
@_date: 2015-04-08 13:02:08

I doubt Rand Paul is against contraceptives and sex education.
My stance on abortion is simple: is anyone obliged to do anything so another might live? My answer is definitely no.
@_date: 2015-04-17 09:23:08
I wouldn't support him because he supports bitcoin. The relationship between my libertarian views and my support for bitcoin is the other way around - I support btc because I am a libertarian. If I had to trade the right of abortion for lower taxes, free markets, legalized drugs, less state spying and less censorship I would do it in an instant.
@_date: 2015-04-20 14:32:14
The scope of this debate in the USA baffles me. How many voluntary abortions are there per year in the USA? Edit: Hmm just checked. More than a million per year. The number does seem pretty high.
@_date: 2015-04-17 07:29:31
I disagree with him on the abortion issues and in general I am undecided on the Palestine issues but you really can't expect to find a politician you agree with 100%. Or even a person you agree with 100%. In a democracy what you do is assign each issue weight and vote for the politician who gets the most points. I know that if I was an American Rand Paul would get by far the most points in my book.
@_date: 2015-04-20 14:50:18
Did you ever think that it may work the other way around. Bitcoin is not libertarian of course but I care more about libertarian ideas than Bitcoin. I support Bitcoin because I see it as an implementation of these ideas.
