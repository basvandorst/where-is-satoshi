Nah.  That's why you need TunaCoin.  All the tuna in the ocean are represented by TunaCoins.  
One TunaCoin = 648500 grams (648.5 kg) of tuna (the average weight of an adult tuna)
For simplicity sake, one Tunoshi is worth 0.000001 TunaCoin (6.485 grams of Tuna).  
Current exchange rates are 1 TunaCoin = $36328.97 (USD).
1 Tunoshi = $0.36

Yeah and paying ATM fees is fiat's fault?
@_date: 2019-03-27 02:12:11
Just buy TunaCoins.    Here, read my whitepaper, and invest in my Tuna ICO

Don't forget warm (ocean) storage.

This is completely different though.  In this case, you're just withdrawing tuna that you already own.  It's stored in your global tuna account, and you can withdraw (or deposit) portions of tuna at these ATMs.

TunaCoin - The first Tuna-backed cryptocurrency.
We'll leave the Tuna in the ocean for safekeeping, but each TunaCoin is worth 3 ounces of fresh, live tuna.

Except it's not.  I've been working in crypto since the early nineties. And "crypto" as the short form of "cryptography" has been well established for many decades longer than I've been involved in it.
Now, whenever people who work in crypto see the term "crypto" used to mean "cryptocurrency" it's confusing af.
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:02:43
How about cryptocurrency?
@_date: 2018-10-08 20:50:44
Bitcoin is just decentralized karma
@_date: 2017-08-11 20:01:07
I'd recommend not using the short form of "cryptography" that's been well established and in widespread use for decades.
@_date: 2017-08-11 05:32:25
The use of "crypto" to shorten "cryptocurrency" is the only thing I don't like about cryptocurrencies.

Nice try, Butterfly Labs' competitor.

Exactly. Just like Neal Stephenson's Earth tool in Snow Crash inspired and became Google Earth.  
Of course that happens a lot.
I was joking that a bunch of is re-interpreting a store in *The Simpsons* that sells cryptography and codes, using some kind of crazy Nostradamus-interpretation logic, and trying to say that BTC is going to hit 81000 because that's how much the crypto barn is worth in some game.  All because people who were unfamiliar with cryptography previously started abbreviating cryptocurrency as crypto. smh

And so, 
1. Famous entertainers famously play with tigers, stick their heads in tiger mouths, and other high risk stunts
2. Simpsons has an episode in which famous tiger-stunt-entertainer is attacked by tiger, literally the most likely scenario given enough time
3. Tiger finally bites tiger stunt guy
4. "sImPsOnS pReDiCt tEh FuTuRE" - OP while [OP'sFaceLikeThis.gif](

Posts like this one, full of people buying into it, is exactly why we have the ICOs we have.

Crypto = Cryptography?

I mean... all bitcoins are created out of thin air.  There's just a consensus as to how many there can be

Heck yes.  Can I staple you to a tree?

It amazes me how few people understand btc or blockchains in this sub.
@_date: 2019-01-23 17:47:22
You just worry about being bread from the future. I'll worry about stapling you to trees.
@_date: 2019-01-22 08:19:19
Link to the video?
The screenshot says "Loads of Codes," and a lot more about codes... codes isn't cryptocurrency, it's cryptography.

Every time.  It's like BTC people think they're going to crash the system, as if the system isn't just going to co-opt the tech and currency to continue as is.
A few days ago there was a thread where people were thinking that bitcoin will destroy banks (because you know... no one needs loans, or secure custodianship of assets with easy access from different regions or anything), and the IRS... as if the IRS never collected taxes from people who used cash, which is far less traceable than bitcoin.  
It's weird, man.
