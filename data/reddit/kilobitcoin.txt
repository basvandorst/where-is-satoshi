Because the concept can be expanded to build out solutions that are more generally useful. Imagine a trustless sidechain or entire communities of trustless sidechains. I have more questions than answers as well, but that was my attempt to ELI5.

In the most basic sense, any centralized service based on bitcoin can be considered a sidechain service. Surely you're aware of changetip? You send it bitcoin on the blockchain, and when you tip someone that transaction stays off the blockchain and is only recorded in the changetip database. The person you tipped tips two other people. Again, no blockchain updates have happened. The only place the value was transferred is the changetip database.
Another example is coinbase. If you send bitcoin to another coinbase user theres no blockchain transaction id. The only place the value was transferred is in the coinbase sidechain.
