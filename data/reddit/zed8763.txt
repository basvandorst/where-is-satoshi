Sign up on bitfinex.com and you can short coin instantly 
Step by step.
Load your "Trade" wallet with funds. These will be used to backup your loan (and will be deducted in case of a loss). I'm pretty sure this only works with BTC/LTC and not fiat. (some one correct me if i'm wrong).
When you think you have found your sweet spot, enter a sell amount and place your order at either market or place a limit order at a fixed price. This essentially initiates a "loan" and automatically you borrow BTC/LTC and your position is entered in the system.
In "open positions" you will see the value of your position. It always starts negative because of the spread. In order to profit on a short the buy price must go lower than your original sell order price.
To reduce the position or sell out slowly, enter buy orders again from the margin trading tab. To completely close the position you can simply click "close" next to "current positions" tab where your open position is listed.
Tips In times of low volume, be careful buying and selling large amounts. Even small orders of ~5 btc will effect price during low volume. You can stagger your orders over time in small increments.
Set some kind of stop loss. You can use limit, stop, or trailing stop orders to do this. For more info on how they work check out investopedia.
Be careful trading on margin! Your losses as well as profits are amplified. You can set your margin requirements in user settings. I suggest starting with 1:1 and then moving up as you get more comfortable.
Finally, never play with more than you can afford to lose. I have a fixed % i trade with and that's it. You may get some big wins, but always remember you will inevitably lose big as well. Keep track of your data as bitfinex logs suck. That way you will have a more accurate layout of how your doing.
Good luck!
