It's not incoherent, but probably requires further context to make sense to you.  You see, antinatalists believe their problems and other people's problems will be best resolved by bringing the human race to an end. The unfortunate lack of critical thinking here provides an excuse to be lazy. 


I am so proud of you for not blaming your parents in a situation like this.  You are a rare find in the antinatalist circle. I actually had a discussion with an antinatalist who adamantly declared his parents were to blame for bad choices he had made in life. 


If you say so

Weird that you bring religion into this

I've reported this comment to the moderators because it's off topic.

One who believes everything bad that happens to them is somebody else's fault

Nobody believes that the market will solve all problems.  It does however address a lot of things.  Your categorization of the market aa such breaks down in the face of your extremism.
Anyway, one wonders what you're doing in this sub.  You're obviously not a bitcoin advocate.  Trolling perhaps?

Again, you are mentally unstable and while you don't realize it you are digging yourself deeper and deeper into a hole you cannot get out of.  Now we have to add self-identity issues to your laundry list.
Check yourself in somewhere.  Get the help you need.

You are now officially an idiot.  You don't even know the full details of the philosophy you pretend to follow. Check in with your fellow rantinatalists for the highlights. 




No but I'd try my best to have you committed in order to better protect society. 


Further proof of your delusional state.  




Nor the most important, but that's not what he thought...

You keep saying that and yet you keep responding.  Can't deal with anything but your own invalid thoughts, can you?

David, it's not your fault.  Dr-Slay wandered a little too far off the path of his home r/antinatalism, got lost, and stumbled his way into here.
Notice how everything he "contributes" to the sub has nothing to do so much with cryptocurrency but with twists back into his own miserable personal agenda.  The deeply nuanced sociopathic hatred for mankind.
He has nothing.
He is nothing.
He will be quickly forgotten.

Market worship has nothing to do with death denialism. Your just painting things to fit your agenda.

Antinatalists are experts in this field

Ah, I see you're attempting to slide your antinatalist agenda in here again.  Reminder: Nobody asked for it and nobody cares
