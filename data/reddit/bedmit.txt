We already have some converts that are now Bitcoin's greatest assets... Timothy B. Lee for example.

They can only transfer BTC IOUs, like Ripple.

There is another cost you missed. If miners are not selective enough, their blocks are too big to be efficiently propagated to other miners, which leads to dropped blocks and missed profit.

IMO altcoins got "popular" for these reasons:
* lots of newbies with regret and thinking in style "I missed the boat with bitcoin, what is the next big thing"
* GPU miners lost their profits when FPGAs and ASICs arrived and had to switch to something else. They suddenly became incentivized to promote litecoins and primecoins.
* pump &amp; dumps are much easier done with altcoins and on newbies
I see these three reasons as the "perfect storm", the sum is greater than the parts. But they cannot be sustained and so cannot the price, compared to bitcoin.

No. He will have to make another transaction to your litecoin address. If he's missing funds from first one (should not be possible, but there could be a bug), he should contact the support.

If a person is proactive, this proactivity can be directed many ways and doesn't exclude community involvement. She even contacted members privately and asked for our input, something nobody else has done. I have no fears she will represent us well if elected.

Yes, except it's using blockchain.info servers for querying and pushing transactions.

Nice scenario, now I wish I'd have those BTC too...

I hope you know you can only hold IOUs, not real cryptocurrencies. IOUs are similar to having balances on online exchanges.

If he based his decision on volume, it was a mistake. MtGox does not have 80% market share anymore.

I never owned any litecoin. The hype is interesting though so I thought about it a little (copy-paste from yesterday):

So, where is Reddit?

With the data you have, there is still a chance to recover. You need a programmer to write you a customized bruteforce cracker, based on your hints.

The attacker stole about 2000 BTC, then worth less than 50000 USD. He was only semi-successful, because of the USD denominated limit; was there no limit, he would have made a killing.

He wasn't working there for a whole year, foundation was created at the end of september 2012. 15k for three months seems quite reasonable.

@_date: 2013-08-26 07:05:41
Did you at any point explain Bitcoin to your friends or relatives? You in a way represented Bitcoin, did you ask the community for permission to do that? 
As I cannot prevent you or Amir Taaki speaking about Bitcoin, the same way I cannot prevent a group (BF or DATA) to organize a meeting with government officials. Everyone is acting within their own agenda, community is just a sum of such individuals or groups.
@_date: 2013-11-15 11:26:22
What makes you think this is a requirement? The data is in the blockchain, you only have to use software, that knows how to interpret it (OSE server for now).

Beside privacy, there are also security benefits. Not long ago there were some problems with random number generators on androids and blockchain.info. People that didn't reuse addresses were safe from the exploit.

Is there only one OSE server or can anybody run their own? If the latter, I really don't see a problem!

Couple of positive OTC ratings for small sums of money means they can be trusted with small sums of money. When there are millions in the pot, things often change. Trust in crowds, trust in technology, but don't blindly trust (anonymous) individuals.

Basically I agree with you, but not 100%... It could be interpreted to be consumer good in a form of "shared ledger" or "limited digital 'commodity'"... there was perceived value in those two properties even before it was actually used as money.

When you create new GAuth accounts, first scan the barcode with barcode scanner and write the security code someplace safe. That way you can rebuild your phone authenticator when needed.

I very much doubt it. I signed up to CampBX in July 2011 with unique email address and the signup email was the only mail I ever received at that address until today. I've never seen a system with SMTP logs reaching that far back...

Imagine yourself investing a percentage and then imagine losing half of it in matter of hours. If it hurts too much, lower percentage and try again until you feel comfortable with the investment.

It is a security thing. There was a hack back in June 2011, when this rule alone prevented the attacker from stealing the majority of bitcoins in hot wallet. It would have been a disaster.

Have you thought about alternative explanations? Your PC could be infected and emails harvested. Or your previous ISP (employee) could harvest them. Is MtGox specific address the only one receiving spam?

Yes, you can buy streaming access:

I don't think this is possible, addresses are not compatible. Is your friend trustworthy?
@_date: 2013-09-27 13:15:35
While I understand your perception of XRP as a threat to Bitcoin, Ripple without XRP would not make much sense. In a world of multiple currencies and gateways issuing them, it is not reasonable to expect liquid markets for all possible combinations. But if you have at least one liquid market per gateway (gatewayX.IOU/XRP), the possibilities of exchange are limitless. XRP as a native currency (no counterparty risk) is acting as a glue between gateways.

this is technically possible and likely just a matter of time
@_date: 2013-09-27 14:56:34
I see the value in Ripple, the technical system and the company behind, with their whole business development strategy. I'm not affraid Ripple would suck the air out of Bitcoin; they are complementary, they can work great together, making the whole pie bigger instead of competing for percentage of it. Yes, XRPs are not as good store of value as bitcoins are. They are even more volatile and very overpriced IMO. But that doesn't mean they cannot be worth a lot in the future. I'm mostly betting on bitcoins though.
@_date: 2013-10-12 10:08:09
I sold my 50k XRP from first giveaway in Feb for 0.25 BTC (about 8 USD at the time), because I thought it couldn't be successful. After the price rise, I made my due diligence and am now very excited about Ripple. Still kicking myself for not doing it sooner.
You can read JoelKatz posts on bitcointalk [here]( his posts are clear and to the point. If you're a bit technical like me, it's time well spent.
