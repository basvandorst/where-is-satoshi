With current mining reward still at 25BTC, and [at most 600 transactions per block]( that's a 0.22% decrease in reward. If any miner's profits are that close to break even, they'd be done at the next difficulty increase anyway. Transaction volume has increased 10x since 2 years ago, and will continue to grow with increased adoption - which lower fees will help to bring about! 
tl;dr: miners aren't phased. transaction fees are a drop in the bucket, and many mining pools don't even shares them with the miners!

I applied to get "verified." if I can send USD, buy BTC, send BTC to coinbase, sell for USD - why aren't others who have both of these accounts doing this? Are BTC transfers still blocked?

I'd been waiting on buying a memory upgrade for my new laptop. Was sitting in my Amazon cart but I decided to use this opportunity to spend some bitcoins. 0.0956 BTC price was just a few bucks more than Amazon, but well worth it. Transaction was fast and seamless.

so my question is: how does mining software generate this "random" guess? It seems you'd want to avoid duplicating other people's work (like avoiding common lottery numbers). Would you start with your motherboard serial# and your mac address and ip address and add characters from there?

I noticed that between Circle and Coinbase, The total transaction cost is almost identical, if not slightly less on Coinbase. I'm convinced that Circle intentionally adjusts its exchange rate to build in transaction fees. I prefer how Coinbase is up front about it (which is not to say that they're not charging fees AND adjusting the rate). 
Also, the lack of an Android app for Circle is a bit annoying. I know it's coming, but the coinbase app is really quite convenient for quick buys/sells.

I think those who were around when bitcoin was the only coin, and maybe litecoin see the alts for what they are. Others who are coming in later to crypto feel like they missed the boat on bitcoin so they're trying to jump on what they think is the next ship with altcoins. Really just get on board with bitcoin - it's not too late.

How is it 100% risk? If you were hodling BTC before the fork, you hodl both after, you're playing both sides of the bet.

If bitcoin failed, it probably would have happened regardless of whether or not there was a fork. It's always been my sense that if bitcoin failed, everyone would be turned off of cryptocurriencies and they would all plummet for many months or years. But that was before ethereum existed and it was coins like dogecoin and litecoin that generally moved in lockstep with bitcoin and couldn't be traded directly for fiat currencies from exchanges. The times are definitely different today. I think we're at the point where diversity among coins is a good thing, but I still prefer to hold majority bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-12-13 00:06:00
I think it also depends on how you give it. I gifted some bitcoin to a neumismatic coin-collecting mom who thought it was interesting, a gen x cousin who thought it was cool and felt like she was in touch with the millennials, and another cousin who thought it was ok. I gave them a token bitcoin and a little explanation on what it was and how it works. I've kept a backup paper wallet for them in the likely case that they lose track of their key. I think it's a good gift in the way savings bonds can make good gifts. This year, they'll get an update on the value of their coin which would make it seem like a gift that keeps giving (so far).

I've never kept my bitcoin savings on an exchange (just a bit of spending money). But then these bubbles start building and I want to sell off a few coins (to buy back after the next crash). So I fire up my bitcoin machine and start syncing or loading up a paper wallet (btw I use Armory and QT). And by the time my wallet is sync'ed, the bubble has busted. Perhaps this isn't a bad strategy.

I'm afraid it would come off poorly - like you wanted to play your hobby on company equipment. The only way I could see it going well is if the guy in charge knew about bitcoin and likes the idea, but didn't know it could be mined on your hardware. Possibly bringing up that fact would be enough to get a casual green light. 
@_date: 2013-07-09 20:32:03
Folks who know R&amp;D and Manufacturing certainly understand what's going on even if they're not happy about it. The problem is that most of these customers are simply motivated by greed. You can't really sugar coat it. They're mad because they wanted to make money. The hobbyists and casual miners aren't the most vocal about the delays.

I'd like the approx $1 denomination to just be a "bit". Two bits for a soda. A hundred bits for that nice jacket. Tip the bartender a couple bits. And my crystal ball says .001 BTC will be approx equal to $1 in 10 years (1BTC ~ $1000)
At least in America, the UK and possibly the EU, we'll use a slang term equal to around that value. 5 bucks, 10 quid, what have you. It just needs to work with whatever is listed on a price tag and in whatever app you use to pay.

isn't the flow of blocks more or less self-regulating by increased difficulty? if anything, BTC price may continue to rise since buying will be the only way in (even now, at current prices, mining can be reasonably profitable, but not for long as difficulty rises faster than BTC value)

Thanks for the info. Definitely quite different dynamics at work between the two. I suppose an asicminer share should rise or fall in line with BTC value, while paying out dividends simultaneously 1% per week is ridiculously good compared to traditional stocks. The productivity of these shares I don't know about. Do they plan to continue to add hashing power to maintain a certain percentage of computing power? Are shares diluted? If so, how often and how much?
I kind of like the idea that GPU mining has a bit of built in hedge in the event of a bitcoin crash - that GPUs still have some (albeit quickly depreciating) value for gaming graphics. Not so with ASICs. $250 is probably better spent on mining shares with these kinds of dividends than on ASIC hardware, which continually gets less productive like GPUs.

Craigslist Ad? Maybe someone nearby has 50BTC from early mining and could use some cash. Could be a bit hairy situation with that much cash on the table, but to have a cup of coffee and chat it up while waiting for confirmation could be an interesting little adventure. I suppose it's not that much different than buying a car/motorcycle on CL, and I've done that.

If only BTC value would rise proportional to increased mining difficulty and hashrate to maintain that $5 per day per GH/s!

This is awesome. If you even used BTC for a portion of a down payment, and that's what got you in the door, it would really show the dealership that accepting BTC was a good move. Or if you bought a whole car in BTC and the dealer just immediately changed it out for USD, still a big win for everyone. 
@_date: 2013-05-31 19:52:40
Right now I'm getting around .044 BTC/day with right around 1.0 GH/s, counting pool fees, downtime, etc. It's constantly falling as hashing power is added, and there are more noticeable drops at each difficulty increase, which happen every two weeks. A miner can keep adding hashing power to maintain their income, or plan to let the productivity decrease with time.

How much does a share cost? I'm curious how it would compare to a GPU mining investment at today's difficulty and prices. 
To compare, you can mine about .026 BTC/day with a 500MH/s GPU miner that might cost around $400-$500 that you could sell when it's no longer profitable. 
@_date: 2013-07-10 17:22:58
That's just a sign of inexperience. Every young engineer thinks they can solve a problem and deliver a solution in a much shorter time than reality. It's extremely unfortunate that these individuals were interfacing with customers rather than someone with more experience, foresight, and tact. 
@_date: 2013-04-30 16:29:32
And that's a HUGE variable given bitcoin's price changes over the past year. Last last year, people were saying GPU mining wasn't even worth the electricity, which it wasnt - at $10/BTC. But if you'd kept mining, even eating a loss on power, you'd be way ahead today. It really comes down to whether or not you believe bitcoin will die or survive. Die it goes to $0, survive and it'll rise for years. 
@_date: 2013-06-27 08:10:24
but if they're already selling these GPUs to miners, a mining specific card would just cannibalize that 2-3%

They had a nearly year long R&amp;D redesign that included a new chip, board, and power supply. They're just now getting production going at the pace it should have been if their initial design worked as expected last year. 
@_date: 2013-05-21 00:43:09
If you're interested in mining, it still makes sense to GPU mine for now and have an ASIC preorder in. When the ASICs ship, you can sell the GPUs. If you're just waiting for ASICs, you're missing and already late ship, and you run the risk of near zero reward even when you get yours. It's like mine hedging. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 20:34:16
The thing I like about buying GPUs for mining is that if they become obsolete as miners, they're still great as GPUs. Sell them on bitmit/ebay/CL to a gamer and get at least half your hardware investment back.
That's the biggest problem I have with spending USD on any ASIC product - if they stop being profitable, they also become worthless.

I certainly didn't mean to say that customers *deserved* to get burnt. I have an order with BFL just like the rest of the queue. We'd all like to earn our investment back in bitcoin. But the folks who are screaming and complaining the loudest seem to be the ones that expected to earn 100x returns and are screaming bloody murder over delays which might make their gains much more modest. I kind of feel bad for the BFL crew for the unusually vile hate while they keep trying to release a quality product. That's not to say they should be completely let off the hook for their engineering incompetence and misleading promises, but they seem to get no credit for trying their best while being flamed from all sides.
