Still waiting for 5000...

I wanted to build a blog about how to use Bitcoin. Sort of a "Dummies guide" to using bitcoin for various financial tasks, but I got busy with other stuff and didn't have the time to do research for articles anyway. 
Thanks for all the good info you really are the future, I just think someone else can handle the domain and potential site much better than I can.

I think you mean [THE TANGLE](

See if the interest rates are low. That could be a good sign but yes, I personally believe (my views are mine alone and provided for entertainment purposes only) that the housing market is a bit pricey at the moment.

What I do is set my limit order way below what I think it will go to as insurance for when I go to sleep.

$100 or 100k? Gawd. What is it about Bitcoin that causes people's sense of a comma and common formatting to fly out the window?
100k by September of 2019.

This was my favorite post of the day. So thank you. It gives me a lot of hope.
 Even if I'm not a millionaire in USD standards  some day, I'll be able to proudly say that I bought amongst a lot of FUD and that I learned a lot of interesting things and met a few cool people along the way.

We haven't quite hit the "Death Cross" (according to my research/opinion...which are my own...for entertainment purposes only).
There also some speculation that it will drop over the next coming days. I'm personally waiting.
@_date: 2018-03-15 17:07:17
Hey hey heeeeeeeeeeeey!
@_date: 2018-03-26 12:56:07
You've said a lot bout the Death Cross coming in, so that tells me you look at a few (at least a few) charts.
Are you overall bear or bull on Bitcoin though? 
Also, you've been a redditor for only about a week?

I'm brand new to crypto. If I understand correctly: the best wallet is a hardware wallet or a paper wallet generated while not connected to the internet. Right?
I keep telling people that one of the tenants of Bitcoin and crypto is that you are in control of your own money and that you should limit any 3rd party access to it as much as possible.
I was about to transfer money to a Bitcoin IRA, but...as I said before...I don't trust third parties with my crypto.

You know that because of their bravery, they saved Greece, caused the rest of Greece to rally behind them, and now historians and military leaders still quote them and study the Battle of Thermopolye?

I think the key word to widespread adoption is : permissionless. 
(Is that actually two words? Should it be hyphenated?)
When your electric car can drop you off, offer rides, stop to get a recharge and pick up some food before your drive home, it will need a crypto address and function all on it's own. Imagine trying to do this on your own with your current bank

What you know as "technology" today is just the advancement and improvement of our understanding of the world around us. Moving from the stone to the bronze age was due to a "technological" advancement. Now sit down. Adults are talking.

Ok so that explains a lot. So can I send a payment from a non-lightning address to a lightning address?
@_date: 2018-03-26 16:52:26
Can I generate a paper wallet address that could receive coin on the lightning network, and then swipe it later back into the lightning network?

I don't expect to see a new ATH till October

The thing I keep hodling to:
Can you imagine a world where Bitcoin (and yes, I mean Bitcoin specifically) no longer exists?
Technically, I can, but it requires such suspension of disbelief on my own part that even the analytical part of brain starts to laugh at itself.
So if Bitcoin is here to stay, and every year gets adopted by more people who want to use it to move large sums of money without having to wait for their bank to conduct a transaction that "should be" instantaneous, then shouldn't the value and price of Bitcoin reflect that? Especially as it becomes increasingly finite? 
Because Bitcoin has wider adoption by general users than Ethereum, Litecoin, etc. And because it has lasting "brand recognition" I think that it will still be in the top 3 in ten years.

I have no idea but I have a limit buy in the 4-5 range. I didn't come up with this. The trader i talked to was about 75% sure it would continue dropping though. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 03:13:54
Nah. The current hodlers will...but we'll go down fighting

This is one of my favorite arguments for Bitcoin. The carbon power it takes to send mBTC from one wallet to another via a phone (without considering recording that on the block chain) is so infantesamaly small compared to the amount of work required to do that via banks. Hell... I wonder what it costs in energy for every dollar the US prints?

Useless Fiat...that I have to use in order to buy btc...


Rich...in what terms? Compared to Fiat? The same currency that we currently use to price BTC? Or will I still be rich when I own 1 btc compared to the hundereds of other guys from Wall Street that are buying 100 btc easily?


How can I make the moon comparison without Fiat?
