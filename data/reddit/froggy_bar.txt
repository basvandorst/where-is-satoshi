I thought exactly the same. Personally I feel that the simplest solution is the best solution in most situations.

My colleagues love coming up to me and saying "have you seen the price of bitcoin (or whatever crypto)" on the dips.
Yes areshole, I watch the price all day every day buying these fucking dips.
They never come and say "Hey you must be pretty happy today" when the market pops 40%
If you're not in the market, STFU about it and piss off. I don't have time for your shit.

I tried Bisq too, I shut it down after seeing there was no volume in the market.
However I do see huge potential for the decentralised exchange model, in so much as i'm going to go and fire it up now and put a few orders in the market to help create some liquidity.
This (Bisq &amp; decentralisation), as other users have commented is indeed the future.

Bitcoin, the B stands for Beverage (coffee or beer)
