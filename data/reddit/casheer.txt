I'd love to.  We'll be looking to integrate anything that has sufficient demand and doesn't pose security risks to the platform.  From my understanding, NXT certainly qualifies.  Although, I've heard it can be a bit of a challenge.

I agree and the answer is...absolutely not.  In fact, we'll also be offering merchant solutions that allow you to pay direct from any digital currency wallet, without even having a Casheer account.

Thanks!  We have no ETA as of now.  It's still really early.  The new main site should (hopefully) be up next week and we'll have more details.  We will certainly be keeping everyone up to date and following us on twitter may be the easiest way to access updates.

I can see how that wording would seem contradictory.  Wasn't meant that way, be I will take a look at better framing the copy on the full site, due very soon.  Thanks for pointing this out and thanks for the kudos.

Ha!  Nice catch...and thank you.  
@_date: 2014-07-20 22:44:07
Thank you!  These are not in stone but here's where we stand now:
~1% for standard merchants.
~0.5% for merchants operating as gateways  (Allowing cashback and deposit of fiat into the platform at their B&amp;M locations.)

Correct.  We view Casheer as a bridge for the general consumer to go from the legacy payment systems they currently use, to the payment systems of tomorrow.  Casheer will allow Joe Public to enter the world of digital currencies, without all the complication of the underlying tech and with a user interface and feature set, that really adds to the consumer value proposition.

Thank you for the heads up and the kudos.  You know, it's always the littlest things that manage to get by you, no matter how many times you review it.  There is certainly a lot of work ahead but we're excited that the vision seems to really be resonating.  We welcome your comments and suggestions, as this helps us build the products and features that people will find useful, as we work to help push the entire cryptocurrency space forward.  My thanks again.

1.  Payment rails like Bitcoin and Ripple are already free(ish).  So it's as simple as not adding fees, where none are needed.  Bypassing pre-internet rails like Visa, means we aren't beholden to the status quo.
2.  Not enough.  :)
Agreed...it's an incredibly exciting time.

Thanks for the kudos!
Anything that increases the utility of Bitcoin, is good for Bitcoin.  Casheer (pronounced - cashier) creates a viable pathway to mass adoption by allowing general consumers an easy method by which to transact with Bitcoin (or anything of value) without having to worry about whether the merchant accepts Bitcoin.
For example:  A merchant may only want to accept USD as payment.  No problem, simply pay the merchant with bitcoin and that payment will arrive to the merchant in USD, automatically and confirmed in seconds.  
Another example:  Let's say you wanted to send money to a friend in India but they need to pay a bill in Indian Rupees.  Again, no problem.  Simply send the equivalent Bitcoin (or any other currency you hold) and the payment will arrive in INR, automatically and confirmed in seconds.  
There really is no limit the value conversion possibilities and the best part is everyone wins.  You're happy to spend your Bitcoin and the receiver is happy to get their currency of choice.

Fair enough.  We absolutely intend to release an iOS app, although that depends on Apple and whether their current policy reversal stands.

Thank you, the OP and everyone for the kudos.  We welcome any thoughts, suggestions, questions or complaints.  All of these help ensure we are building products that you will find useful and can help grow the entire digital currency space.

If it was, no one here at Casheer did such.  I actually only knew this thread existed because of the spike in traffic on Google analytics.  :)

Bitpay is a single currency solution.  Not really a fair fight, plus no reason to "compete" with those in the space.  They aren't the problem...it's the incumbent payment processors and anyone who charges fees to send money from A -&gt; B.  This extraction of the worlds commercial wealth...will end.  
Thanks for taking the time to check it out.  Any and all feedback is welcome.

At this time, the direct option for fiat would be via Casheer gift card that will be available for purchase.  But that's not really much different than just adding the balance to your Casheer wallet.  (Which we assume most people will do)  Fiat simply can't do what crypto can do and thus a Direct Pay option is pretty exclusive to crypto.

Thanks for the great questions.
You wouldn't need to transfer from your customers bank to yours.  We collect payment from consumers on behalf of you the merchant. Then we deliver payment to you.  After all, who knows what currency your customer will pay with.  It could be bitcoin or even gold or something you don't directly accept.
That said, we can't do much if your bank imposes fees on you.  What we say is, you won't be charged for processing your customers payment.  So if you're currently accepting Visa at say 3% and your bank is imposing another fee to deposit those funds into your account...Casheer removes the 3% fee.  What banks do is unfortunately out of our hands for now.
There are banks now working with Ripple, but not yet in the capacity you're referring.  (At least to my knowledge)  2015 should be interesting in this arena. 
Most customers will pay via mobile payments.  QR and NFC.  (Like ApplePay)  Other will use the Web app to send payment from their computers.  (Like Paypal)  
@_date: 2015-01-01 23:34:16
Absolutely.  Pretty much what you're used to with any currency payment platform, without the processing fees of course.

Person A deposits say $100 into their Casheer wallet via ACH (or crypto asset).  We issue a balance of $100 to Person A's account.  Person A buys something from person B for $100 and person A's balance is sent instantly to Person B's Casheer wallet.  From there, Person B can withdrawal to their bank account or crypto wallet.  (Depending on the currency they choose to accept)  Again, just like Paypal.  Difference is, we simply don't charge the 3.5% (in Paypal's case) to send from A -&gt; B.  
Now, for those who don't like storing funds with a third party, there's the Direct Pay option.  As a Bitcoin holder for example, you can proceed to checkout, then simply send Bitcoin to the address provided at checkout.  (We guarantee the exchange rate for 15min)  You can flip over to your blockchain.io wallet for example, send the appropriate funds and the order will complete.  We in turn deliver say, USD to the merchant.  (Or whatever they prefer)
