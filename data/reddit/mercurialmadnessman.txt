Cross-border wires do take that long, it's nuts. Use Quadrigacx
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:33:24
Are you trading BTC/CAD / ETC/CAD on Quadrigacx? The volume is so low, should I move the coins to another exchange for trading purposes and only use Quadrigacx for deposits/withdrawals?

Yeah I like dealing with them too. Thanks for the tip

Damn straight!

That's pretty freaking cool, IMO

Are you using machine learning?
@_date: 2016-06-24 21:55:08
This is incredible

Significant advances in the industry in the past couple years
@_date: 2017-08-15 03:38:22
This was my first guess as well!

Just goes to show you'll need to hodl longer to see the same returns as earlier investors.
I would really like to see an update to this graph.

Never forget

Good point. I left a buy order overnight and the price went significantly higher and I lost those gains. Never again. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:33:34
Do orders expire? Or can they sit there forever?

You can angel invest with what you have. And the returns can be much better than even btc
