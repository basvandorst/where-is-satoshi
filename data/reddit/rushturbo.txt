welcome! good to have you here! You have a unique viewpoint that I'm hoping you will share with me. I'm working on a project to help introduce crypto currency to the masses. It would be REALLY helpful if you could give me 4 to 8 questions that you would've liked explained to you when learning about bitcoin initially. it could be anything. for example where is my bitcoin stored? how does mining work? anything :)

I also haven't received one and I signed up when it was first available.

At the very least, I would think some investigation is required.

I've already bought some but am waiting to see if it goes any lower before buying more. This is nothing to worry about and a nice opportunity to pick up some cheap bit coin :) Just remember we're talking about a technology of the future. Once it was invented it can't be uninvented. The blockchain is here to stay.

The stock photo from Shutterstock made me laugh! This person must be incredibly stupid if they believe people will fall for this.

Are you using some sort of coin mixing measure to keep people from seeing how much everyone is compensated?
