Yeah the language the reference client is written in doesn't really matter tho
@_date: 2019-07-09 19:13:02
Well his point still stands doesn't it?

Nobody said that only marketcap matters, but only looking at the proce is obviously not enough, due to differebt supplies.

@_date: 2019-03-07 18:14:47
Yeah but if you want to encourage more nodes through low hardware requirements, why shouldn't you do the same for miners, which are kinda more important?
Why do you worry about nodes needing more disk space, but not about the fact that anyone who would actually want to participate in the mining (and therefore consensus) process needs to buy an ASIC first.
EDIT: Mining pools are also bad regarding decentralization, so ...
@_date: 2019-03-29 14:43:32
It does not protect the seller tho, which is bad.
@_date: 2019-03-07 16:05:55
The miners determine what the consesus is so why would you say that the centralization of them is not bad at all/worse than the centralization of full nodes.
@_date: 2019-03-07 22:42:04
xD You edited your post and added the social consensus part while I was answering
And you should not say that "math" will rule over them, when you say that social consensus is the important part
What do you think would happen if someone reaches the majority of hashrate and starts acting malicious?  
Would the devs start setting checkpoints regularly to avoid someone rolling back the chain?  
Would they change the mining algo? (Which you could do in the first place to avoid centralization...)
If so, who would get to decide that? You can't let the miners vote in that case, malicious full nodes could also get spun up, so only the devs are left. 
If you have to trust the devs anyways, whats the point of miners, what advantage would you get by having them if the only thing they are good for is to decide what the next block is.
@_date: 2019-03-29 14:40:16
Even if we fork, you can just calculate the private key of unused addresses that revealed their public key, there is no way to avoid that?
@_date: 2019-03-07 16:00:41
well, a miner might need an ASIC aswell...
@_date: 2019-03-11 06:56:23
Yeah the reason is that someone who knows the address he wants to attack would have to bruteforce the public key first.
So as soon as you use an address you already spent from, its less secure to use this address.
I assume OP intended to also spend something in B (and use the other one as change address and then switch those), in which case its basically as safe as A. (If he does not intend to spend it, he could just use one address and does not have to switch between Y and Z.)
Also if quantum computing would actually be a risk, someone could calculate the priv key after you broadcasted a tx and double spend it with a higher fee than the original one, so it would get included in the block first.
@_date: 2019-03-07 17:59:20
Then why should nodes have lower hardware requirements than miners.
@_date: 2017-08-29 23:41:50
xD no, he asumes that there would be more than 21 million coins, at 21 million coins w/ a two Trillion Dollar market cap one btc would be worth ~$95238,0952
@_date: 2019-03-29 15:30:14
Again, I am talking about an **unused** address.
@_date: 2019-03-07 16:51:06
"miners don't need any hardware except for a big fan" ...
Why do you think that the decentralization of miners is less important than the nodes, if the miners are actually able to determine the consensus?

Do you have any source on it beeing tax free in Germany?
@_date: 2017-08-29 23:49:51
no, [this](
you are assuming that the limit of coins available would be ~23 million, which is wrong, since the actual limit is 21 million
@_date: 2019-03-07 22:14:27
What stops a bad actor from just faking a bunch if nodes? Nothing, he could just safe the blockchain once and have multiple nodes on different IPs act as full nodes (or don't safe it at all and just forward the info from another full node).
You use PoW to defend against those sybil attacks.
So of course they determine consensus, if the consensus would only depend on the majority of full nodes a malicious actor could spin up a bunch and take over the consensus.
@_date: 2017-08-14 00:12:31
yes, keep it in germany /s
@_date: 2018-10-19 09:54:11
Yeah thats right, if you invest in it and don't trade it for a year, you can keep the profit tax free.
But do you know whats the case if you want to offer a service for (exclusively) crypto?  
If I am only accepting bitcoin for a service and I am not selling the bitcoin I receive, I would probably still have to pay the 19% VAT in germany right?
If that is the case and I live only by using bitcoin, I would have to sell the crypto to pay the VAT, would there then be an additional tax because I did not keep it for a year?

How about you look @ the most profitable trade everytime, therefore
BCH-BTC pair, with BCH-&gt;USD over 10k
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:49:04
It also hit that route, bust just not on every exchange, yet!

Or can you send a link the the tx?

They probably won't care about you at all, if they make profit.
So its prob more like either they hate you, or they don't care about you!
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:39:59
it did, there are also other exchanges than gdax, e.g.:
Bithumb @ $10,567
HitBTC   @ $10,246
Coinone @ $10,558
Bittrex   @ $10,079
Binance @ $10,128
Poloniex @ $10,245
Also, I would bet, that when this post is on the frontpage, it will probably also have hit $10k on gdax!
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:43:34

@_date: 2017-11-28 07:34:06
..... yet again:
Also, ADA-BTC was over 10k, now it is below 10k again
BTC-&gt;ADA-&gt;USD was over 10k
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:33:56
it was kinda obvious that this was going to happen xDD
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:23:18
Yes, not every exchanges had it over $10k, but that doesn't matter, since the average of most of them was over 10k at one point in 2017!
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:32:02
xDD Simply MCAP(USD)/Supply(BTC)
~$3.7M/BTC, with the current supply of BTC
~$2.9M/BTC, with the maximum supply of BTC
But you would obviously have to take in account, that the value of the USD wouldn't stay the same, etc.
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:17:15
The average is below $10k now again
Not every one of those(, but some,) was a BTC/USD pair, but BTC/(other top coins), if you calculate what those coins would be worth, than you will get to those values, also:
 was already over $10k (look @ the history)
 was @ $9989
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:48:38
u know that "the great flood of vegeta" is what they are going to write into history books xD
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:36:35
100satoshi/byte atm. especially with the mempool getting flooded with many tx with ~this or even a way higher fee
There are some pools offering to prefer tx over another, but those are getting flooded too:
There are also paid services, which may be more or less legit, e.g. 
RBF may be an option, but it would probably also take some time until you got the btc to resend it/RBF it ... xD
@_date: 2017-11-25 12:46:09
he gets it
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:56:09
Ik, that this is not what most of the people are looking for, but those are just alternative routes (which I would probably also take)
But still it also hit $10k on some BTC-USD trading pairs!
@_date: 2017-11-04 09:30:48
You do realize, that your comment is nonsense, right?

Also, ADA-BTC was over 10k, now it is below 10k again

@_date: 2019-05-22 16:14:21
The address is a hash of the public key, so if you've got the address you can't calculate whats the public key, only the other way around.
The QR-Code you would be walking around with only encodes the address, not the private key, since you only need the address to recieve btc.
So as long as you don't send from the address, nobody could see the public key, if you did spend, someone could look for the public key in the blockchain.
@_date: 2019-05-22 16:06:45
When spending you sign the tx using your public key.
If your public key is revealed, an attacker would only have to break ECDSA to get to your private key, if it isn't the attacker would first have to find out/bruteforce which public key is the corresponding one to your address.
