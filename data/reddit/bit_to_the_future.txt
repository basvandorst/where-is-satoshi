More importantly, its 3 months worth of coins that can't be sold.  That individual would be able to use the coins purchased for collateral in a short.  Close the short with cash plus coins.  The ideas are not mutually exclusive.

This comment fits business men/the rich better. However it could also imply that the rich using these havens don't have a problem with other factors of our monetary system and allow for some undesirable aspects so long as it does not effect them.

Bitcoin may solve the big problem of how to peacefully transition from a closed system to a open, free, and new system where one has no one to blame but themselves if they see their spending power decrease because of its gains in usage.  If the bond holders you are referring to convert their entire holdings over to BTC then they would loose the current market cap of BTC compared to their bond investments.  A small number on the grand scheme of things i think you can agree.  They could do it gradually, or randomly...what ever they want.  
If Early adopters of fiat (credit) obtained value in terms of inflated asset prices why is it different or wrong for a bitcoiner to expect to gain value for being an early adopter of it?  Who you yourself I assume hold some?

@_date: 2016-04-05 17:15:37
I see both of your points and to be fair you can pimp the system either way.  Both an inflating currency and a deflating currency offer opportunities to make "magical increases".  I'm going to start by defining that in terms of spending power using just the currencies in question; not in conversion from one to the other.  
(this is simplified for conversational purposes)
step one: buy a financial instrument.
step two: wait
step three: sell financial instrument and/or collect its interest.
step one: wait
I've never seen this argument but its not so much about weather or not a currency is inflating or deflating but at what rates and what point in the life cycle the currency is in.  Now if we look at converting one to the other and factor in the above a rational actor will simply go where there is potentially more yield vs. risk in spending power terms.
In a time period where the efforts to get a deflationary currency are to difficult or costly to obtain due to lack of velocity, one will find that a debt based inflating currency is more attractive assuming the velocity is better and obtaining the unit isn't as difficult.
However, if paying back a loan of an inflating currency is too difficult due to low velocity one might opt to convert to a deflationary currency which offers the same amount or more in terms of spending power but in less time then taking the money up front from a late stage inflating currency.  Lenders of that currency will usually feel yields are poor and too risky which will perpetuate the problem and eventually be forced into other currencies that offer better returns.  (possibly at a loss depending on when they convert)
The irony is a low velocity in a deflating currency is natural, no bad intent can be conferred to the holder as it is in the direct self interest to spend less now.  Eventually this will end up like a late stage inflating currency as liquidity will dry up but this should take some time. 
Low velocity in a inflating currency (born out of debt) should not be in any actors self interest unless it is in its late stages where early adopters of that currency have paid there debt obligations and can hold that currency at a premium while late adopters are forced to take debt on.  The late adopters would never be able to pay off their debt as the velocity of the currency isn't fast enough due to lack of liquidity in the system.  Forcing more and more debt perpetuating the problem.  This is where the adoption of a deflationary currency in lieu of taking on debt would be more advantageous and may even offer a smooth transition due to the self interest of the actors.

How does one determine who is a "culprit".  This logic dictates allowing someone of authority to commit crimes so long as they catch others (of presumably less authority?) perpetrating the same crime.

You could NET 775K over 30 years if you left your deflationary currency on the sidelines, but you could also NET 7.5M if invested in the above scenario. 
Realized ROI is expedited in a deflationary system due to increases in the value of the returns themselves. This gives you the option to do what ever makes you happy with your money.
In an inflationary environment, if your not spending your money on investments then you are truly losing 2% a year.  You MUST look for short therm investments as long term investments are wholly unprofitable ventures in comparison.  We pay for this with outcomes that are not always sustainable or efficient in the long run.

I'm not sure why someone down voted you?  I thought that was a good explanation...that is unless your wrong but I assume someone would be all over that if that was the case...
So If i took all my coins out of all the places i have them and put them in a paper wallet pre fork, then let the fork happen, then go sell those coins on the exchanges operating on both networks i would double my money...
If i left them in an exchange, on line wallet, web platform, ect. who ever is "holding them" get to sell the other coins at exchanges in the platform they don't support.  Meaning any exchange picking the wrong side would literately have to go out of business and everyone on that exchange would loose there money?

Trade volume only indicates the amount of trades occurring.
If that was true then the S&amp;P should be considered "dead".
Constant trade volume shrinking sometimes leads to large fluctuations up or down.  Kind of like pushing on a spring or pulling an elastic band until release of tension.  Not always, but sometimes.

Purchasing power if money was simply held for 30 years at 2%:
Inflationary: 556,616.66

Deflationary: 1,775,844.69
Aren't returns based on initial capital outlay?  Which would make renewable all that more attractive as the input for energy is essentially free, therefore curtailing yearly fuel source expense such as gas/coal/oil ect. regardless of the effects of de/in-flation on those commodities?

@_date: 2015-06-05 15:02:55
depends on how its done...people who know how to work exchanges (and have stacks or lots of coin) dump the market lower by tapering there sales and shaking the coin from weak hands on the way down and buying it up at a discound.  once they are happy with there holdings they start a pump by buying for a set time to get people interested again and locking in their "extra coin".  Then they let it run on others money.  If it stalls they lend a helping hand and off it goes again. 
all the while there net value increases.
@_date: 2015-06-04 03:33:18
Luke, unlike many people I'm open to both sides of the debate.  You are clearly much more well versed then me on not only on bitcoin but coding in general and therefore when it comes to how the bitcoin engine should or shouldn't work I listen when you talk.
To me if the question of block size was to be decided by only the technical aspects then I would say you are 100% right and the increase is pretty pointless.  In fact it actually hurts users of the coin in various ways, especially miners! (Disclosure: Im one of "the few, the proud, the miners")
Being a miner kind of sucks now a days.  Don't get me wrong I make decent money doing it but the price of coin is really cutting us lean.  Some times i think these days of tough mining is kind of a good thing...thins the herd a bit leaving only us miners who believe in more then the dollar value of the coin.  Unfortunately dollars do matter  right now so its nice to think that even if your ROI is out at 3-4 years its worth investing in because you believe that bitcoin will take off!  This is what helps us miners through this tough time.  
On a purely technical analysis of what I would come to the conclusion that bigger blocks means leaner times and there is absolutely no reason for it yet.  I would have to be stupid to think any other way. 
What I will say is if a bigger blocks size helps "sell bitcoin" to sectors like the stock market, the real estate industry, fin tech companies, financial institutions, ect..  Then maybe thats just as important to bitcoins success as bitcoin being smooth as a babies butt.

I agree, as of right now the price is not due to blocksize.  
However if bigger blocks helps "sell" bitcoin to larger institutions (which i would have to imagine helps, and at very least dosen't hurt large institution adoption) then price would naturally rise do to larger institutions participation putting the network effect on speed. 
Side chains are a very valid candidate to help facilitate this in another form (technically speaking).  Again its a relatively new resource that needs to brand itself better before this discussion sparks again.

Your making a good point here.  Most people would rather get ripped off then put in the tiniest bit of effort to save a boat load of money.  
That being said I encourage all industries to step in and use the ledger...banking included.  They could bring all their customers to the coin, and those of us who care about maintaining our own finances would be able to continue on our own without using the institution.  The institutions would be getting to use a very secure technology that they don't even have to operate (low costs) but would bring there current clientele over to the chain therefore increasing the market size.  The institutions clientele wouldn't care what they are using as long as there not responsible for theft/loss/ect.
It wouldn't affect any of our principles but it (most likely) would increase our net worth.
@_date: 2015-06-02 02:59:36
It would have to be half but for the people who left there coins in an exchange that only accepted one version or the other they could not do the double spend.
Wouldn't this make every exchange go under?  Either by everyone pulling there coins out to be placed in a private wallet or this double spending thing I'm suggesting? 
I'm not trying to be an ass, I honestly think I'm missing something.

The value of bitcoin is what someone is willing to trade you for it.  I assume you use USD but what it trades for is somewhat irrelevant (not really but lets keep it simple).
Think of it like your in a room with 19 other individuals.  10 of which are trying sell and the other 9 (+ yourself) are trying to buy.  Out of the 10 trying to sell maybe you have 2 or 3 each lowering the price on each other, 2 or 3 more are posting a price above the other 2 or 3 and not budging.  The remaining guys are selling at a much higher price.  
You as a buyer obviously want to buy from the first set of guys selling at the lowest price.  Usually these guys don't have much to sell.  The next set of 2 or 3 guys have a medium amount to sell at a higher amount and the last set of guys have a huge amount to sell.  
Depending on how much you are looking to purchase you must pay "more" for each bitcoin.  This is not always the case as things will average out to a price per bitcoin over a large purchase.  
To complicate this you and the other 9 buyers "should" be trying to get the most bitcoin for the least amount of USD.  When they buyers are moving backwards the price goes down.  They may not accept any offer on the table and everyone has to lower there price.  The opposite is true when the buyers out bid each other.
Sellers and buyers have to meet somewhere and that is what you consider the value.  The spread is the difference between the highest buyers bid and the lowest sellers ask.
This is the 101 version and there are many many many games people play in these exchanges.  I would recommend reading up on markets and exchanges or learning (takes about a year but mileage will vary) with very low funds to start.  Until you know what a "bear trap" is you should hold off on playing big.

Although I'm not religious, I appreciate the general message of most religions.  I personally don't need the dogmatic religious offerings to remain morally aliened, however I would say a good deal of humanity uses those beliefs to "stay the course".  In those instances I appreciate there offerings.  
Applied back to SN and BTC, I agree with your general point...to much rule following is counter-productive.  My problem on both sides of the fence is the cherry picking of what rules and beliefs are infallible and what rules are not.  I believe we are all guilty of that.

Not at all, viruses steal all sorts of information including the currency and securities with our current system.  If a virus were to attack your trading platform and initiate a trade a third party could stop that trade.  For that security you must pay them.  Your payment is for your security, and multiple billions in profits for those 3rd parties.
A wise person would simply encrypt their key or store the keys offline to eliminate a virus as a possible threat, something that cannot be done currently, is free to do, and guaranteed not to be interfered with or botched by hostile or mismanaged 3rd parties.
The question boils down to how comfortable you are in your own ability to protect your assets.  I prefer to protect myself for free then rely on others for payment, especially when its this easy. 
@_date: 2016-03-12 23:34:00
All very true.  The Achilles heel of that system is the fundementals that it stands on.  I believe the biggest flawed belief is that people woudnt work...some might not, but others would be set free to transform the world.  Scary to some but historicaly  real freedom usually ends well.

not at all.  The dollar is not a store of value, they are probably both safe assets as of now.

Your right about something, the chain needs to be expanded before coin can go big.  This little stress test is not looking good because it is only encompassing the small die hard footprint that coin has.

You want everyone to eat there cake and have it too.

"indeed there is nobody to act as central bank or federal reserve to adjust the money supply as the population of users grows. That would have required a trusted party to determine the value, because I don't know a way for software to know the real world value of things."
Block argument aside, the store of value idea seems like two steps back and one step forward.  I'm not here to glorify satoshi as I assume thats the last thing they/him/her would want but using BTC as a fiat denominated store of value seems to me as grabbing the low fruit.  I'm open to all perspectives and would like to know the other side of this quote (if you agree with it) in terms of the store of value perspective.

To be fair, and look at everything equally, how is fiat different?  Everyone who was able to access credit in 1971 and lets say purchased a house for the median price of (aprox.) 24,000 are now sitting on a house valued at 200,000.  It is mostly paid for by now (i would assume) and if not the person refied along the way basically getting paid to own.

@_date: 2016-12-20 18:13:13
The purpose of the tool is to provide a standard unit of value that doesn't fluctuate so business may conduct itself among the population.  Independent of levers held by those who think they know better then you and I what the society wants.  
 
You are correct that inflation can happen in other ways if allowed.  Cost push inflation, Rising asset values, Demand pull inflation, higher taxes, ect.  The outcome is always the same though.  Inflation once out of the toothpaste tube is very hard to get back in the tube.  This leads to bigger and longer swings in the credit cycle.  I don't want to see future generations end up having its entire life inside one of those down swings.  This recession was very long and we are still not out of the woods so to speak. 
@_date: 2016-12-20 20:41:40
Again its concerning people think this way.  Your beliefs become your realities.  If you think you didn't get the job because of your race/gender/orientation ect. then you don't think its skill or knowledge holding you back.  Consequently you never seek out said knowledge or skill to remedy the root problem.  Its much easier to admit I didn't get selected because of something i can't change then something i need to expend effort on to acquire. 
there are a small percentage of people who will discriminate due to those factors, but those people tend to be less successful and and consequently less in a position to even be hiring in the first place.  That also goes both ways for gender/race/orientation ect.

Its concerning that people believe that limiting thought.  I'm not saying you are incorrect in some cases but speaking for myself I would employ who ever is going to produce more value in terms of financial gain with zero regard to their sexual orientation.  Economics dictates that those who share my thought process will push out those who don't.
I cannot play instruments and i have tried very hard to obtain that skill but it just did not work out in my case.  Having the state place me in a band because the private sector thinks i suck is not the answer.  The answer is to find what I am good at and use that skill to charge others willing to pay me for it.  I highly doubt that if a gay man walked into a successful business owners offices and told them they could save them X% of dollars or make them X% more dollars without costing them more then the savings/earnings that the vast majority of business owners would turn them down on the simple fact of orientation.

in a perfect world a banks assets should be zero, we don't live in that world and some level of bank owned assets are normal.  What we have now is a bit unsettling.  Not because the fact that its that high, but that it is that high in exchange for liquidity to the system.  As i understand it, they are keeping prices artificially high after borrowers couldn't repay loans which penalize those who never established themselves in the system.

so lets look at this on a macro level then:
On a macro level  (according to said research) the vast percent of the population intentionally pass up economic advantages over something as trivial as a candidates race/gender/orientation ect.  This fact has to be true if the research is true.
If that research is true, and the assumptions taken from it are due to a candidates race/gender/orientation there is a ginormous inefficiency in the market which could be exploited for massive profits to whoever does employees these candidates with greater qualifications.  Yet to this day no one, including the people who believe this, are able to realize these gains and/or have not acted on this massive inefficiency which if true would surely provide a giant economic incentive to do so.

I doubt this will get answered so late but I'll give it a go...
I never used Gox so consider me a third party here.  I'm a bit perplexed as to how mt. Gox couldn't "keep up the lie" (Please don't judge this post on its question, I'm simply putting myself in Marks shoes).  I worked out some napkin math and if the numbers in the press are true we are only talking about skimming $20 US per coin at market high.  At the time that bankruptcy was filled that value was about a 5% spread.  I don't want to bog this post down with match so I'll simply ask the question...
Was he balling out and blowing the funds?  Did you see any absurd purchases or lifestyles changes with him or people close to him?  Gox was also making money on a per transaction basis and in the big picture the money he skimmed was very small...I find it hard to believe he couldn't re-up and collect the pieces to keep his scam going.  I want to simply believe he was a perp who got in over his head but anyone smart enough to run such a low cost scam should be smart enough to bail themselves out as well.   
Again please don't take this post the wrong way...I'm not endorsing or supporting the scamming that apparently was going on at Gox.  The math just Doesn't seem to add up.

It's very hard to "disrupt" the normal.  I hate that term but its true.  Some will hold out and lose sales, its all based on a kind of fear.  Its just easier to ignore then adapt.  The human brain in action.

I'm skeptical on the economics myself...so don't take this as a defense but...
using these calculators: 
you can get pretty close to a break even at today's price level.  If 21 is banking on a solid increase in price then the economics get to the point of being very profitable for both themselves and the consumer.  The price needs to jump and maybe their whole business model is based on that assumption.

there is no "quick way" to get bitcoin other then:
even then you need to set something up, not impossible but you know the gig.  Hopefully once you get get into the bitcoin space you like what you see and can get more involved.   As far as wallets go the "easiest" is blockchain.info but if you think your going to use the coin in the future i recommend:
 
or breadwallet for iphone:
as long as what you say is true (not illegal) coinbase is a decent wallet for non-investment purposes (also has the ability to switch from cash to coin).  Circle.com has the same advantage.  Up to you on those two.

At least i got a chuckle out of this line from the AP link:
"Some senators were perplexed by the fact that virtual currency is not backed by a government."  The Emperor’s New Clothes much?
The worst part of all this is I could careless what I "use" for money...the problem is its so damn hard to earn/keep/retain value of the notes in issuance today.  "Necessity is the mother of invention" and the necessity is very very much here.

I think the future of mining will be done on the consumer level again...somewhat shortly.  If 21 inc isn't the catalyst there will be another company with a better plan.  
We may even see that cycle repeat itself a few times till only centralized mining can survive due to low block rewards.  I might be long gone by that point but who knows?

imagine super cheap asic chips distributed en masse and controlled by 21.  It would be "centralized control" similar to a pool setup.  They could throttle up or down at a whim with the consumer taking the risk (albeit small financially).
That business model could theoretically endanger the large mining operations that must run to sustain themselves.
Honestly i don't think they are solely in the mining game, and must have bigger plans but we'll see?
@_date: 2015-07-26 20:38:40
just for transparency I'm a miner, so this is not miner anti-miner propagander.  Just forward looking discussions.
the reality is node operators will be the "banks of bitcoins" if it were to continue to flourish.

I'd prefer not to give my public key out, so i guess my chances of having it fixed/explained is slim to none.  
That being said its very very strange.  Its like the coin i had in my myclium wallet disappeared according to blockchain.info...The only coin at that address is the small amount i sent to it from blockchain.info before i realized there was a problem.
If i try to send from mycellium it tells me transaction not found and 0 confirms come up and i cannot receive new funds to it, according to they mycellium wallet that is.

If I had stacks of bitcoin why would I want to be excluded from starting my own settlement device?  Why would anyone want it encoded and give away their source of (possible) future revenue?  Also wouldn't it be better to allow 3rd party options for these bitcoin banks to tie into for decentralisation purposes?

I'm not sure i completely understand your question, but if you are talking about buying bitcoins...
Join up with a seller weather it be coinbase, circle, local bitcoins, ect.  Then buy some bitcoins.  Take that first bitcoin of yours and head over to  and order yourself a trezor with some of that new fangled bitcoin of yours.  When it comes in, take whats left of your bitcoins and deposit it into the address on that device.  Make sure you back it up and when it comes to selling go back to the place you bought from and sell away.   
@_date: 2016-09-13 20:25:41
I agree.  Ultimately the banking sector gets to determine who gets to stay in business and who doesn't.  If me and you both make sprockets and i get a loan while you do not then my company will more likely be able to out sell your company.
I'm sure someone will say loans aren't issued arbitrarily and all i can say to that is GM, the fannies, citi, ect.  No amount of regulation can fix giving a ever smaller pool of financiers the ability to pick favorites on who gets to be business.

You are right.  However these features help the common user...I've been seeing more and more of these features lately.  The common user prob doesn't pay much attention to the price.  This bodes well for more advanced users and my guess, the soon to be new application oriented users.

Some might consider this a threat to bitcoin...
I look at this as WU and ripple being the ones afraid of bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-04-22 23:48:03
Look for products that are currently sold for bitcoin.  Then look for other vendors selling the same or similar products at a cheaper price who don't accept bitcoin.  Let the vendors who don't accept bitcoin know that you would have spent your money with them if they accepted bitcoin because they were cheaper.  Ask them to notify you if they ever plan to use that payment method in the future as they are cheaper but for now you are going to spend your money with a higher priced competitor.  
That was just one example but the idea is create demand for the product.
Most people are afraid of change and unfortunately "negative" (need based) tactics work better then "positive" (better for you) tactics.  If their competitor takes bitcoin then they will be forced to adopt it or lose market share.  Hopefully their is crossover with other products carried and you can jump around from company to company.  
This is fiction but is right on point (Possible NSFW language)

If currency was not fiat then it wouldn't matter that a bank gave you the boot, go get another.  However it is fiat and therefore its akin to locking the organization out of economic transactions.

Unfortunately the power to decree law, set tax standards, and borrow without collateral does not allow for fair play.  On a equal playing field no one would willingly choose a inflating currency.
I do not see how it would even be possible to abolish a the currency and its most likely not needed nor ever going to happen.  Simply put, BTC has been one of the best if not THE best investment since 2009.  Out of all the stocks one could buy at that time here are the best of the best returns I could find:
SCSS .25 to 31.00

The production speed is set correct, but the work required to get your share of that production changes and so it would follow the cost changes for your share. Transaction space is being commoditized.  I'm not sure what the effects of this would be but would love to see if someone has something on it or you could offer some insight?
