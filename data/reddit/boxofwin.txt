I'm waiting for Coinbase to reveal how they buy/sell BTC behind the scenes. When you authorize $2,000 for 100 BTC on a Monday, what happens exactly? Are the coins purchased instantly, at the going market price? Does Coinbase then keep the coins in escrow, and deliver them to you upon successful bank transfer? Does Coinbase wait until the money hits their bank account, and then execute the trade at a mystery price 7 days later? Does Coinbase run trades of their own on the side? WTF is going on over there that results in trades being cancelled like this? How can users possibly feel confident putting major volume through Coinbase with threads like this?
A few more of these threads and I'll have to switch to MtGox, and I really don't want to do that. Quite sad because Coinbase has the most potential out of any current American exchange, and they just added an API to buy/sell coins. 
It's about time the Coinbase guys showed their faces here.

Infinite number of clones = infinite opportunity for Bitcoin to integrate new innovations into the main client.
As for your other point, you could say the only thing giving USD value is "speculation" that people will continue accepting USD in the future. Given QE-infinity, I'm personally speculating that USD/EUR/JPY will continue to decline, and so far I continue to be correct.
Investors are clinging to USD given how bad EU is looking. But USD, the legacy banking system, and authoritarian regimes are less than spectacular. You can hoard gold, but that's ultimately just a shiny metal object, and there's hardly any infrastructure in place for everyday people to trade precious metals for goods and services. Especially not on the Internet. Especially not anonymously.
Bitcoin is the answer.

+1. While it may seem possible or even easy for the US government to demonize Bitcoin to the point where local retailers become too fearful to accept it, an attempted ban could blow up right in their faces.
The first country to publicly move against an alternative currency, especially one as hapless and small as Bitcoin, may succeed in the short term - especially if they move soonish. But given the sorry state of the global economy, any action to stop the flow of capital into safer havens could be akin to poking a hornet's nest. Blocking Bitcoin would be like blocking ATM cash withdrawals.
If the US gov tries to ban Bitcoin publicly and succeeds, sure, their circle jerk of cronies in big industry and media would be congratulating them. "Good job". Pat on the back.
But at the same time this publicity could be seen as an early warning sign that the bridge is burning and the emergency exits are starting to close.
Keep in mind rich people, when it comes to matters of money, are historically **always the first to leave**. Also, rich people know Bitcoin in higher numbers than you would think, and certainly they watch the markets closer than most.
Should this theoretical anti-Bitcoin scenario play out, it could have an interesting effect on cash reserves at banks. Of course, nothing happens in a vacuum and the outcome of a theoretical ban depends on the global financial and political outlook at the time of the ban.
In short, you should consider the very significant political and economic risk for any State to publicly sponsor action against alternative currencies, because it could accelerate the decline of confidence in the State's respective financial systems not to mention systems of governance.

I think the draw of gold and silver has more to do with the fact they've been used for such a long time as a store of value than their actual inherent value. They're ultimately just shiny metal objects. Whoopdie-doo. They're heavy, they're stealable, and there's no real infrastructure in place for everyday people to trade them for goods and services. In this respect, gold and silver both suffer from the same problem Bitcoin does, market adoption. You know how all your friends bitch about how you can't use Bitcoin at the grocery store, therefore Bitcoin is surely doomed? Yea, you probably can't use gold or silver at the grocery store either.
"Quick, get out the silver scale and let's calculate the true value right here in the grocery store by taking the weight of the silver and multiplying by the going market rate; oh and let me pull out my anti-counterfeit kit to make sure the silver is legit." And this is all supposed to be done by a 15 year old kid. Yea, gold is massively overpriced. Just let the elite hoard all the paperweight and shiny metallic objects.
Anyway, regarding your original question - you can't make an omelette without breaking a few eggs. Getting into anything new can be a frightening experience at first - that's just part of trying new things. But seriously, if you're an American, why even use MtGox? Just use Coinbase, it couldn't be easier. And DON'T trust Dwolla, they're no better than PayPal. Which is just about the worst insult you can give to a fledgling company in the payment space.
As far as price, if BTC sees mass market adoption the USD/BTC price will probably exceed $1000. You're worrying about price today because you're trying to "time the market". That's a workable strategy, but the only question that counts is whether Joe Dirt is going to use BTC one day. Because on that day, BTC might be over $1000 and early adopters 500x their investment. If you want to time the market go get $250,000 and program a high frequency trading bot, or something.

    We do what we must because we can.
    For the good of all of us
    Except the ones who are dead.
    But there's no sense crying over every mistake
    You just keep on trying till you run out of cake
    And the science gets done and you make a neat gun
    For the people who are still alive.
    I'm not even angry.
    I'm being so sincere right now.
    Even though you broke my heart and killed me.
    And tore me to pieces.
    And threw every piece into a fire.
    As they burned it hurt because
    I was so happy for you.
    Now these points of data make a beautiful line
    And we're out of beta we're releasing on time.
    So I'm GLaD I got burned think of all the things we learned
    For the people who are still alive.
    Go ahead and leave me.
    I think I prefer to stay inside.
    Maybe you'll find someone else to help you.
    Maybe Butterflylabs -
    THAT WAS A JOKE. HA HA, FAT CHANCE.
    Anyway, this cake is great:
    It's so delicious and moist.
    Look at me still talking when there's science to do.
    When I look out there it makes me GLaD I'm not you.
    I've experiments to run there is research to be done
    On the people who are still alive
    And believe me I am still alive.
    I'm doing science and I'm still alive.
    I feel FANTASTIC and I'm still alive.

And risk drawing even more attention to Bitcoin? Just imagine: the Western financial system is in its final throws. Meanwhlie the US gov't and major banks have lost all credibility. Then, in a moment of pure genius, the US gov't comes out with a nasty media propaganda campaign villainizing Bitcoin, while also wiping out every Bitcoin exchange, including international ones. American Bitcoiners are getting their doors busted down by SWAT teams. It's a worst nightmare scenario. So what then?
If the US gov't indeed sees Bitcoin as an existential threat, and decides to start ruining lives over it, well this would really be no different than their stance on cannabis. Importantly a "Bitcoin prohibition" would do nothing to diminish the inherently valuable properties of Bitcoin, nor would it scare away people in other countries from trading for BTC.
The bottom line is governments with an anti-Bitcoin agenda can do nothing but flail around wildly in the hopes of scaring the shit out of people. This is extremely risky behavior because their wild shenanigans would only drive more people to Bitcoin.
In trying to impose a Bitcoin prohibition, the US gov't would be fundamentally manipulating the financial markets without producing a better alternative. Result: utter failure. More Bitcoin demand, and higher Bitcoin prices. If you doubt it consult a history book for the effects of any prohibition. They make it more dangerous to use Bitcoin, prices increase, and in the case of the presently-unknown Bitcoin, demand would increase from all the publicity.

It's hard to put your finger on why gold is so overvalued. But to me it's about freedom. Bitcoin has value because it's designed expressly to maximize financial freedom. Bitcoin creates unmistakable, borderless, infinitely divisible, infinitely portable, infinitely durable, and instantly communicable financial freedom.
Gold on the other hand...
I mean, really! Right now there's very little incremental benefit to utilizing gold **in a vacuum** vs. plain USD when it comes to individual point-of-sale transactions. Cash and gold promise to do the exact same thing for you. Both USD and gold enable you to trade at the point-of-sale with a physical object of which represents a similar value to multiple parties. But even at the point of sale, things aren't that simple with gold. The price of gold fluctuates. Gold can be faked. Gold is heavy. Gold is bulky. Gold can be stolen from you by force. Gold doesn't do escrow out of the box, gold must be weighed on a scale, and on and on. There so many reasons why gold sucks besides the fact that it is extremely low tech. The only advantage of gold is it doesn't require the Web to function.
Conversely, Bitcoin can do all of the things gold can do, and more. Just print out your BTC private keys on paper bills and you have BTC cash. It's about as low tech as it gets assuming you at least have 3G to check the balance, and there are plenty of guys competing to come up with more elegant solutions.
But try paying in gold for goods across town. Try paying in gold for goods across *borders*. Try carrying your gold with you *anywhere*. Also, assuming you're holding physical gold, where are you going to keep your gold? Fucking in the ground, in your backyard somewhere? You're going to go find a shovel and dig it up every time you want to buy something? How are you going to do that without drawing attention to yourself? What happens if your back gives out? What happens if a central authority outlaws gold transactions as has occured in the past? What happens if a thief finds your impossible-to-find fireproof safe in your home or on your person and just steals it while you're asleep?
Oh but you have *weapons* to defend your gold stash? Weapons with 10 round magazines. Weapons subject to state control measures. You can buy better weapons with Bitcoin. You can buy better drugs too. You can buy ANYTHING, and you can buy it **with escrow**, anonymously, meaning you won't lose your ass if you're dealing with scammers, and you probably won't be killed for your actions. So in the event of an economic or political catastrophe, guaranteed you can buy everything worthwhile with your Bitcoin; but I bet you can't buy nearly as much with your gold. OK, maybe if the whole Internet goes down for a prolonged period and everyone is without power, AND the government actively does DPI against Bitcoin/Tor network activity on the level of China but worse. In the event of an utter worst nightmare breakdown of all societies in which all levels of government turn on the populace, you have your trusty gold so congrats. But you know what? Gold doesn't work over Tor.

Switch to Electrum. Memorize seed phrase. Fill with $1k and carry it with you everywhere you go, no computer involved. Profit.
Low tech thiefs can take your gold/silver at gunpoint. Follow you home too and stalk your vault. I'm much more confident carrying around a brainwallet.

We all want price stability. To be clear, my point is BTC *could* one day have price stability, and if so it will work better than it already does with loans. However such a scenario depends upon outside factors. If fiat falters, Bitcoin will be the clearly better alternative standardized indicator of wealth, price will soar at first then become stable, which will create an environment more conducive to loans. But the world needs to know about Bitcoin first. Face it the market cap is $200M. Most people don't care about BTC at all right now.
There's one major P2P loan marketplace in BTC: 
There's also an up and coming question mark: 
@_date: 2013-02-02 04:19:33
Price stability and mass market adoption of Bitcoin will go hand in hand; but mass adoption will only happen if/when fiat currency falters. This is the news the BTC market is waiting for, and until we either confidently clear a global recession or enter an unprecedented depression, there's no way people can arrive at a fair market value for Bitcoin as a substitute for USD, EUR, gold, etc. As of today, the USD is good enough for most people. That does not make me very confident.
An absence of economic and political information keeps a lid on Bitcoin demand and puts pressure on Bitcoin speculators to sell. Very little else does. At the same time, the global markets have never been so loaded and unpredictable. In 2013, we could easily see investors flee to safe assets, and Bitcoin competes with the likes of gold and silver. It also makes a ton more sense, but I digress. After multiple EU exits or a currency crisis here and there, who knows what the full market adoption of Bitcoin could look like.
So the Bitcoin price is driven by information, and right now we don't have enough of it to accurately price Bitcoin. Of course BTC loans are a problem! So don't loan any BTC. Problem solved.
Bitcoin works best today as a hedge against currency risk; it's better than gold, at a better price, and mostly because no one knows about it, and if they do know about it they don't understand it; and if they understand it, they don't see a need for it right now. USD is good enough. Adoption by everyday people will not occur until they have a "so what do I do" moment, e.g. 2007/2008. There must be an economic hit large enough to propel millions to the Internet to look for solutions. The chance of that happening, albeit small, is still greater than 0.
Will economic and social turmoil in Europe catalyze local retailers to accept and prefer Bitcoin? Will 2013 have us witness greater riots in Europe, or even riots in America? Markets change quickly, and the blood pressure is still rising.
A BTC/USD price of $50 is possible without significant economic and political downturn during 2013 just based on limited supply of BTC, but for a BTC/USD price of $100-$1000+, ordinary folks will have to be worried about their respective economies and currencies, and investors must be extremely worried. At that point, it will become a daily occurence for people to dump hundreds of thousands into Bitcoin at market price. And if we push &gt;$100, expect this to light a fire under Bitcoin innovation, and expect social recommendations to snowball. The BTC economy is a virtuous/viscious circle, depending which way BTC price goes. Basically the BTC price will do the opposite of what USD/EUR/JPY does. Importantly, we have to know what USD/EUR/JPY is going to do in 2013! If by some miracle these countries get their proverbial shit together in 2013, BTC could drop to the single digits and everyone will forget about it. However, political gridlock in US creates an environment of inaction and incompetence in Washington, and egos are blocking any semblance of progress anyway. I'm extremely bearish on global fiat. I count my blessings every day the global scheme continues unabated.

Think of a friend's email address.
If you know your friend's email address is johndoe what can you do with that information? Well, you can't really do much with it, aside from send it email, because you can't log into johndoe without knowing the password. Only John Doe, who knows the password to johndoe can interact with emails received at johndoe I repeat, this is because John Doe has the PASSWORD to johndoe
Enter Bitcoin. With Bitcoin, your email address is called your "public Bitcoin address". Your public Bitcoin address is where you receive Bitcoins, e.g. email. Just like an email address, if you know someone's public Bitcoin address, you really can't do anything with it except send it some Bitcoins. I repeat, this is because you must know the PASSWORD to the Bitcoin public address in order to really use it.
In the Bitcoin world, this "password' is called a PRIVATE KEY. So to reiterate, you need a PASSWORD to manage johndoe but you need a PRIVATE KEY to manage a Bitcoin public address, aka some string of text that looks like "12uadfj89radflkajsdlfk".
You can derive the private key - aka PASSWORD - for any Bitcoin public address by running a computer program that knows the Bitcoin algorithm. It's just really, REALLY hard to do. It would literally take decades for a very powerful computer to get the private key (PASSWORD) to a Bitcoin public address. But the important thing to note is that, unlike with an email address, a Bitcoin public address is ALWAYS associated with a specific Bitcoin private key, and ONLY with that particular key. This key CANNOT be changed or recovered like an email account password can. You must know the private key to get access to a Bitcoin public address.
Making a paper wallet is about protecting that private address as much as you can, by never letting the private address anywhere close to the Internet. The private key is your password, and it's your ticket to managing the Bitcoins sitting in a public address. This is why it's important to protect your private keys as much as possible. If that public address has Bitcoins sitting in it, then basically having a private key is the same thing as having money.
What you're doing with a paper wallet is generating a PRIVATE KEY to go with a public Bitcoin address, except you make sure not to tell anyone that you have the private key. This is just a security measure on your part. The public Bitcoin address ALREADY EXISTS, but no one fucking knows the private key, because again, it's really, really REALLY fucking difficult to derive the private key from its mathemtically associated public Bitcoin address. You can do it with a quantum computer, but for now it's virtually impossible.
With Gmail, you choose a password when you create a new account. With Bitcoin, you don't choose a password; you use a software program to generate a random private key, and that key acts as your password to one public address.
Once you have a private key generated, e.g. the PASSWORD to a Bitcoin public address, should anyone send BTC to that public address, you are now able to manage the address, just like John Doe is equipped to manage johndoe with his chosen password.
Now you might be thinking, if you can generate a private key like this from your computer, can't someone else also generate the same private key? Why, YES. YES someone else CAN generate that private key. But the odds are roughly 1 out of 2^256. In other words you're more likely to be struck by lightning than generate the same private key as someone else.
An offline paper wallet is ultimately just a private key you generated without being connected to the Internet. You use a software program to generate the private key, and write it down on paper. BAM. Now you own the associated public address, and there's no freaking way anyone can get that private key. You wrote the private key down on paper. Now whenever your friends send Bitcoins to the public address that goes with your private key, you can spend and transfer those Bitcoins with your password, which is written down on paper and hasn't ever touched the Internet.
HTH
