For an investment that long o would maybe just spend 500 a month.

Always do and thanks for the advice.

You should come join us at .  Its a cpu only coin and within a few months it will finnish its mining stage of about 124,000,000 quarks.  After that the block reward for miners will be 1 quark (worth ~8cents now) .  The reward is currently 2 quarks.  Its designed to be a currency not an investment.  Is has 6 different types of encryption so asics will never be made for it.  Gpu mining is horribly slow and unprofitable and never will be profitable.  The time for a quark transaction is 30 seconds,  time is money.  Last but not least there is a solid comunity of devs and helpful users,  we're very open to newcomers :)

Oh well it may go up again and I make a good profit from what I sell :P

I understand the risks of keyloggers ect. I mean i don't actually store any bitcoins on my pc. I just used a localbitcoins style site to send directly to the wallet address. Did I do something wrong? Anyway thanks for the advice and I do already use Ubuntu for all my main bitcoin trading ect.

The mining is actually about to be implemented so that the wallet will automatically use 10% of the cpu power by default.  At the moment though im assuming hash rates have dropped.  51% attacks are not possible because the developers added checkpoints to the blockchain,  everthing after a non matching checkpoint is ignored by the network.

Exactly what happened to me,  I would have put my life savings in it.  I would be a millionaire now...

0.01510574018 for &amp;10 is my offer.

So according to you 83,000 bitcoins were 'reversed' in transactions today (on average) in the one orphan block?. What happened to them and why is it a problem? Using the same maths 3000 quarkcoins were 'reversed' today.

Actually using a dice to generate 100 base 6 digits is apparently more random than any random algorithm.

Password encrypt it with truecrypt and upload it to a cloud of your choice.
@_date: 2014-03-05 20:51:58
Ok I was calculating under the assumption that there was an equal spread of transactions per block yesterday and taking away the number of coins that would be equal to the percentage of orphaned blocks. Same with Quark. So I understand that it is bad from an efficiency standpoint but is it ever detrimental to the actual transactions? Are coins ever 'lost' this way? If only in terms of efficiency then Quark is a CPU only coin, right now the network hashrate is 950MHs which is more than sufficient, therefore the overall economic cost of the 8% orphaned blocks per day isn't overly high. If coins are 'lost' then I think you will agree that there doesn't appear to be any realistic chance of it happening. If the orphaned blocks increase the confirmation time (if that is what you are suggesting) then the confirm time is still 38.262 seconds, better than most currencies.

No they mean the time for 1 confirm

Do they want donation or do they want profit though?

Its for this reason that I use   Direct to wallet instant buys feel so good.

Hi the community is interested in how we can help you? :) +5 qrk

Bitcoin services tend to bring in the malware and phishing emails. Tbh any sort of website where 'friends or 'other sellers'' can scrape your email from seem to be the culprit.
@_date: 2014-02-08 13:28:45
No I have explained about the private key and my nan isn't known for taking selfies or anything but thanks for the advice :)
@_date: 2014-03-05 18:39:34
Have you heard of this solves the transaction speed problem.  I would encourage you to give it a quick look.  +5 qrk
@_date: 2014-06-18 16:16:53
How much over the rate are you willing to give?
@_date: 2014-06-18 22:20:47
Yes that is true , ok on Friday after my last two finals bro. I've sold lots of quark but I always buy my bitcoin on exchange , but what can I say you have good rates :)

i mentioned that i had earnt some money and then told him the fundamentals he was amazed by the technology and then i told him about the increase and he said it was pretty impressive.
@_date: 2013-12-26 15:23:41
well there are other places offering the same deal. i suspect that netlix can bulk sell the codes to retailers at very low prices as they dont cost anything to make (like CDs).  What seller wouldnt sell for the industry standard price if they get more money for it?  Either way if i can get it at a discount i will not complain at that, and many others are the same as me.
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:32:18
i told my grandpa and he was amazed at it , ive had people at college wanting me to buy some for them
@_date: 2013-12-04 23:42:39
localbtc mate the extra is worth it sometimes 
@_date: 2013-12-25 07:48:22
Its a bitcoin clone I believe,  all the asics and fgpas moved in right away if it is.
@_date: 2013-12-26 15:40:27
Ouch hope that doesn't happen to me, the seller seemed too nice.
@_date: 2013-12-26 13:50:18
I am willing to send you the email conversation and any other proof you want then can you confirm it here please?, i live in the Uk and this guy just spent five days helping me to redeem the US voucher.

Middlecoin pool?
@_date: 2013-12-26 15:39:41
I honestly don't know why they are so cheap, I don't think they are stolen though because i don't see how you could steal a code. The seller sent me his personal email, full name and bitcoin address so you are welcome to do your own research if you want me to pm them to you. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 07:54:30
Whelp I tried man :)
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:15:31
I agree,  I bought in at 400 so in that respect I am lucky but this is my first crash and it's a missed opportunity all right. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 15:44:12
Hmm i hope it isn't... 
@_date: 2013-12-16 01:21:49
@_date: 2013-12-26 14:08:18
it is a private seller online selling gift vouchers, i can pm you proof if you are willing to confirm it here?
@_date: 2013-12-25 07:46:19
Wow, Santa,  many amaze!
