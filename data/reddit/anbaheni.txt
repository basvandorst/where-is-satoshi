If you buy a dog from a breeder instead of adopting from a shelter you are a selfish person who deserves to be shamed.

Exactly. This is a fact

Wow good job buying an animal when so many are in underfunded shelters miserable and abandoned by other awfull human beings

Yeah its a shame this didnt get more attention.
In regards to govs outright banning exchanges, that is of concern but there will always be jurisdictions where they can operate legally, like switzerland. Plus you dont need exchanges to get your money into crypto initially since you can find someone willing to sell bitcoin for cash in pretty much any city pretty easily.
Projects like substratum and nexus earth are moving really quickly to make a decentralized uncensored internet available to anyone anywhere on the planet. Their projects are moving very quickly as we could expect the first version of substratum available to users in january or feb 2018 and the first nexus earth low earth orbit internet satellites are also due to be launched next year you can see how quickly this space will outpace traditional institutions.
I think you are right when you say "we have already won"... we have managed to make an evolutionary step forward in terms of decentralizing financial services and that is just the beginning.
However I do worry about how governments are going to be able to cope with the new challenges this will prevsent.

It might be a little less convenient to go to the atm regularly but having even a small amount of cashnon you for day to day use has allot of benefits..

Exactly that... imagine you have a several hundred dollars worth of btc, eth, etc, bitshares, ripple, monero, litceoin and then you forget about them for 12 months... then you go and look at the value of them. You would be rich..
