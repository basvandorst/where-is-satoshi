Here's a chart showing the average transaction fee for bitcoin transactions over time:
It appears to be at about $15 now. So basically an ATM at a Vegas Casino. It's come down from $19.2 which is more like ATM at a strip club. This is fine, but you just gotta know about it before trying to spend your coin to buy a pack of gum.

I am probably misunderstanding the specific requirement then, but The rub is that it is the company policy that restricts trading of stocks, bonds and other securities without first checking a list. If it's on the list, you can't buy or sell it, or possibly are forced to sell it. If you already own it and want to sell it, too bad. If you already own it and want to keep it, the list might say you have to sell it.
Well they're changing their policy to include digital currencies (I guess regardless of whether they are securities) and I've heard that they're putting BTC on their list.

Never set your cash out points to nice round numbers. That's how you lose money.

I googled Dogecoin price and laughed out loud when the first result was: Dogecoin (DOGE) price, charts, market cap, and other metrics ...
That much analysis for dogecoin is just too much ridiculousness for me.

Oh god, can you imagine being a bitcoin developer and sending money using code you wrote, not sure whether there is a bug in your software... I'd rather do a trust fall into the arms of pennywise the clown.

I sadly sold mine at $7900 or so. Outdated insider trading laws are treating BTC as a security and because of the job of a family member who regularly has access to insider info on stocks and companies, I can't freely trade it any more. I could be forced to sell them during a dip without any notice, so I opted to sell when they were at near record highs. I am so sure it's going to 10,000 though. I'm super jelly.

You want to talk about high risk? Venezuela's Cash Is Now Worth Less Than Currency in 'World of Warcraft'. You could buy a million of them for like $30. If the economy ever recovers, you would be sitting pretty. Yes sir, indeed!
You're effectively betting that their newly "re-elected" president will die in some way or another, cause that's the only way that hell will end.

I would love a wallet that lets you set your own fee and deprioritize timeliness. Like set the fee to "I'll fucking wait, thank you"

Damn, this is amazing. I sold several at $7,900, but I'm only doing that to buy my wife a car.

It's not always a good idea to pay $100,000 down on your mortgage all at once if you suddenly find yourself with that much money. If you spend everything you've got just to be free of debt, and don't leave yourself extra money for emergencies then you are putting yourself at huge risk. It's better to keep the $100,000 invested and earning interest while also getting the mortgage tax deduction. If you lose your job, you can get your $100,000 out of the investments as needed, but if you use it to pay off your house, and lose your job, then you have nothing left for expenses or emergencies.
If your investment interest is greater than your mortgage rate then your mortgage is actually profitable. And that doesn't even take the mortgage tax deduction into account. I've already paid off one mortgage, sold that house, bought another one and I'm about to pay off my second mortgage. I only did it because I am extremely limited in what I can invest in. So all things being restricted, that was my best option. But most people have better options.

Don't forget about the guy who said he would personally suck every guys dick. We need to make sure if he ever goes to a baseball game that the jumbo-tron shows his face next to that quote. It's more efficient to take care of it while everyone is all in one place like that.

It's a company policy to help employees comply with insider trading laws. So there is a list you have to check before buying anything, however, once you have something, you can be prevented from selling it or forced to sell it quickly. So it's pretty risky to buy anything at all. That includes stocks and bonds. But you can buy and sell real estate, lend people money with interest or put your money to work in other ways.
Needless to say, I put a lot of money into my mortgage because that was the next best option. Paid off my house in like 5 years. But real-estate is crazy at the moment, so I'm replacing my cars, paying down my new house and hodling the rest in traditional bank accounts like a good little saver person.

No, I ~~checked~~ *asked about that specifically*. I was told my only option was to hold until the official policy came out and if it said I had a week to sell everything, I would have to comply. I decided to sell right away and have the flexibility to do it at a relatively high point.
Someone seriously needs to light a fire under ~~the SEC~~ *the company my relative works for* to fix their ~~laws~~ *policies*. Insider trading laws simply don't apply to mainline digital currencies like Bitcoin and Etherium. I can see how an ICO would be under that scrutiny though.

If you did this at coinbase, you basically broke even.

We shall see. When ~~coindesk~~ coinbase allows people to have access to their bitcoin cash on 1/1/18, we shall see.
Edit: fixed. thanks!

If I knew that, I wouldn't be using coinbase. Honestly, I would love some info on actual peer to peer transactions.
