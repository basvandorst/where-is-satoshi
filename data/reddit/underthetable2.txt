Sure. Just a correction. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 18:13:50
And a million other things neither. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 13:36:53
Funny. All day off topic general financial news gets posted here because eeeeeeverything is relevant to Bitcoin and it's all fine with you but mention Litecoin and you start complaining it doesn't belong here. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 20:21:33
Yeah, 5 people a week paying with Bitcoin. Huge loss. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 16:35:00
But obviously you are just joking as that would be the most idiotic theory ever. Right?
@_date: 2015-07-08 15:54:41
Have fun in fantasy land where Greece will adopt Bitcoin. 
My god...you people. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 18:51:30
Anybody not living in fantasy land could've told you this. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 18:30:51
Surprising. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 20:20:10
Nothing out of the ordinary in this sub. 
We just ignore it happened and do it again next week. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 13:03:53
Dude, it's a joke. Just a joke. He isn't trolling and he has 0 mod access. Calm down. It's reactions like yours that makes them do this. If only you would understand this. 
@_date: 2015-07-01 09:53:52
All those downvotes come from a few posts where he says Greece isn't adopting Bitcoin. 
Looks like he was right and that there was a lot of rage downvoting going on by Bitcoiners who expected to get rich off Greece. 
But hey, don't listen to this guy. He has a lot of downvotes. 
Anyway, back to your topic. 
What's next? Don't worry, this sub will find the next big thing to pump within a week. They have been doing this for 2 years. Just sit back and wait for the first post that says "THIS IS HUGE!"  
@_date: 2015-07-08 12:07:07
Bitcoin is not an option. It just isn't. 
I really wonder what alternate reality the downvoters live in. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 18:35:38
Didn't see that coming. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 19:54:09
It just has so little to do with Bitcoin. And even if you say it does than it's the same as Mtgox shutting down and Bitstamp getting hacked. Fiat user not affected. See how lame that sounds?
@_date: 2015-07-08 18:32:58
My bet is people will still be making nonsense posts on the internet. 
@_date: 2015-07-09 13:54:59
It's odd how everyone here considers it completely normal that every payment you make costs you a fee. Have you ever considered that the rest of the world might not be interested in a payment system where you get charged every single time you use it?
Oh and the best part is how for years you people have been promoting it as a free system. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 16:38:08
Thank god. 
@_date: 2015-07-01 09:21:19
Because this looks like Greece adopting Bitcoin to you?
@_date: 2015-07-08 15:56:07
It is what?
@_date: 2015-07-08 17:55:34
Bitcoin bitcoin bitcoin!!1!
@_date: 2015-07-08 16:02:13


Yeah horrible. Good thing Bitcoiners would never do such a thing. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 20:18:29
Fiat user not affected. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 16:45:03
Wooooohoooo Bitcoin!!!!
@_date: 2015-07-08 20:24:18


I stopped reading there. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 18:50:27
Yup. Only happened 30 times before. 
Someone is downvoting all my comments. Probably the person who fell for this shit 30 times. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 11:05:03
Please stop calling it a stress test. 
@_date: 2015-07-01 13:12:19
We've had 30 of these posts now and they are all equally useless as no real numbers are mentioned. Anyway, a 2 seconds look at the charts tells you all you need to know. Greece isn't buying coins. Can we please move on now and stop with these ridiculous pump posts. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 19:52:06
Biiiiiitcoin bitcoin bitcoin!!!1!
@_date: 2015-07-08 20:30:14
True. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 15:56:54
Bitcoin bitcoin bitcoin!
@_date: 2015-07-01 11:04:47
Give it up. The pump is over. 
There is no Greece and Bitcoin. I think that should be completely clear by now.
@_date: 2015-07-08 20:22:14
There must be so much dissapointment in your life. 
@_date: 2015-07-01 09:42:35
Greece is not hawt anymore. The pump is over. The dumping has started. So you're wasting your time. 
May i suggest finding a new country to pump since you are one of the top pumpers here?
I saw Puerto Rico going to shit might be the next hawt thing. You may want to check that one out. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 13:38:17
So as he said it can't handle it. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 16:26:24
So you went through my account and now are warning others about me because i pointed out a fact you don't like? Seriously?
@_date: 2015-07-01 13:16:16
Hilarious how you are getting downvoted. Reality is hitting hard now the price is declining. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 11:42:44
Why not?
@_date: 2015-07-08 21:01:58
Actually lots of people are who took advice from this sub. But that doesn't seem to bother you or anyone else here. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 15:50:27
It's so completely obvious i'm not even gonna explain it. Anybody with any sense of reality understands this. 
@_date: 2015-07-01 10:03:55
Such a crazy rally!
@_date: 2015-07-08 20:04:54
You seem a bit upset. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 17:38:21
Don't worry. Bitcoin is working far better than everyone expected. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 19:09:38
Neither are a zillion other things. Come on man. It just sounds so desperate. 
@_date: 2015-07-01 10:28:02
Bitcoin cracks as traders are done with the pump and now are dumping. Just like the previous 100 times. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 20:44:45
Where have i heard that before? Oh right, at 1200 1100 1000 900
800 700 600 500 and when we couldn't get any lower 400 and at the absolute bottom of 300.
