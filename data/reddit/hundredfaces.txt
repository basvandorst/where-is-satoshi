Thanks, I'll look into it :)

Wow, 300 sites of catching up :o Guess I'll read it in traffic tomorrow, until then, still studying FAQ's.

I guess nobody reads the description anymore, even though I wrote, that I am in file hosting business and we don't have to worry about electricity, because we have a flatline fee for our servers anyway. 
Anyway, case closed, I calculated everything and there is no point.

Ummm... I am not entirely sure what did you mean by that. I believe I didn't jump to any conlusions in my posts.

Did you mine with your regular PC, or dedicated hardware?

I am synchronizing both Bitcon-qt and Litecoin-qt as we speak, and reading about them in the meantime. I am actually pretty confused by the amount of different coins. According to this  I should start with GLDCoin as it was created this month and not many people jumped it yet. LTC seems more suitable for me until I do decide to make a rig or buy Bitcoins.

Yeah, I just used a similiar one and calculated everything, my hardware is too weak, so I decided to read more about buying BTC instead. Thanks for the link tho!

I don't even try to compare my current chances of investing into BTC to early adopters. Mainly,  what I was wondering was: should I invest into a mix of gaming/mining rig,  that I could use later for gaming and getting at least half of its price back or should I rather buy BTC and let them lay down in my wallet for like half a year (while observing BTC prices ofc). Both obviously while learning about BTC as this value is much closer to my curiosity than any real currency. I don't want to sound ignorant regarding the learning experience, I just believe that if mining simply became pointless,  then learning about buying BTC instead is a better time investment. Last but not least, a huge thanks for your willingness to share i information :-)

I understand you point of view, but your nick suggests that you are biased, just as economist would advise me to learn about economy as it is important part of every man's life and yet people have low to zero knowledge about it, if you get my point.

Very good post, thank you.

Just talked to a hardware-savvy friend of mine that lives on academic campus for another 2 years. Many people talk about how ASIC miners come out in 3 months, and we were thinking about investing in it together, as he does not pay for electricity. Could anyone provide me with a link where could I preorder ASIC miner, or maybe the one I found is a correct one? 
It either would be ASIC Miner, or this 4x Sapphire Radeon HD 7970 rig as fast as we could get our hands on it while learning more about BTC mining in the meantime.

I'll look it up as soon as I get home. Browsing on smartphone ducks.

Forgive my manners, but is this an answer coming from a miner, bitcoin investor or just an observer? The insights you told me are on the same level as discussions in the FAQ topics from 3 months ago, basically nothing changed? I tought that 3 months of time made the situation for to-be-miners worse, on the other hand rewards will be be constant for upcoming 3 years.
(I know this post looks a bit aggressively, it isn't, I'm just really trying to drill down into the topic).
@_date: 2013-05-27 14:07:48
Perfectly summarized, and yes, I was basically asking that :)
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:20:35
We dont pay for electricity - therefore I was simply interested if mining with that gear will provide ANY income, since we pay for those servers ANYWAY.
