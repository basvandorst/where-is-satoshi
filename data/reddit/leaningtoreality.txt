Exactly! And like Icarus, they will burn their little wax wings... ��  Banksters menthality... 2 confortable, to greedy, to fat... The begining of the end for them i suspect.... A true shame because we need more, much more entry doors from FIAT to crypto...

I am right there with you Nuno... The fact that the exchange it s decentralized does not mean " It has no rules", just means it s decentralized. What is there not to like!? Less hacks, less manipulation, and so on... Consensus on the works... Just like the cryptos we all love :) Till then, just a few half popped Hulks, half new half legacy... IMHO this present model of coinbase and the likes, it s just a hic up on the way... Like using oil to install solar panels... Beeing solar the end game, like using a nail to take off another nail.

Oh yea! Up market, down market.. sell or r buy they wet their peak... That s the business model. Lets see how long they will survive wen decentralized exchanges start to emerge and gain traccion... Or they evolution or they die... Binance CEO says its their plan to become a decentralized exchange, eventualy... If true.. Great! More please! FIAT to decentralized exchange... Then we ll have all cylinders firing! :)

Why anarchism has to equate with chaos on people´s minds!? It s not BTC a form of anarchism? :) It works! Maybe not in a way that pleases everybody, but it works. Dont you see so much chaos on lots of "organized" states troughout the world? 
I get your point, realy, but endeed self empowerment becomes with ineherent  and proportional responsability. To own our shit, for the good and for the bad its essential. You can have fire fighters and functional rules on an anarchist society! Why not!? 
I m not an anarchist, or a comunist or a capitalist for that sake, I am what I am and i gess there are diferent ways that fit diferent people and that s the beauty of this world. And... point made that we can have anarchist fire fighters and anarchic rules... and lot s of anarchists are juvenile and BTG it s probably a scam :)) But who knows!?
