I understand the technology but the sad truth is, it can only get so big before government sees the power of controlling everyone's assets slipping out of their hand. 
No the government can't steal your bitcoin, but they can make it near impossible to do anything with and force it underground which will drive the price down pretty hard. 
The question is how far away from this are we?
