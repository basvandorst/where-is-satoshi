Well here's what you can do:
You can keep your money in the exchange you initially donated to until you verify your account by sending an international-stranger-who-oversees copious amounts of "untracable" "money". You can totally trust them.
After giving them an unobfuscated Photo Identification, they'll ask for your  bank account number / routing number. Again, you can totally trust them. When the exchange is inevitably raided for facilitating a large number of criminal organizations in money laundering, you can totally trust those guys, too.
They'll typically drop a deposit in it from an account flagged by the international banking community as a high-risk account. That is, they make thousands of deposits all around the world from people cashing out their bitcoins, many of those accounts already affiliated with law-enforcement raids who were too dumb to open new accounts.
Congratulations! Your bank now regards your account as suspicious! You won't notice right away, not until deposits begin to take an extra day-to-weeks. By the way, depending on your bank, this information may have been solicited to various law-enforcement agencies, and depending on the judge, can justify a search warrant for just about anything associated with the account (car, home, work.)
But who cares about "bank accounts," right? You've got BITCOIN! The world is at your fingertips. You can... buy groceries online, where they'll be delivered in a few days or so! Fresh produce picked by a guy in a warehouse in china who mailed it! You can also pay for gas at a few obscure places in Connecticut and Wyoming. Shit, you can even donate to a multitude of torrent trackers. Something for every one! You can literally replace money with bitcoin. The vending machine, the supermarket, the gas station, the bus fare, the atms... we have literally DOZENS of those places all over the world that will accept bitcoin!
Exciting times these are my friend, exciting times!
@_date: 2013-11-05 14:43:34
Your bank has flagged the transaction as suspicious and the fraud department is looking at it. The transaction is in fact complete from CB's side, but BTC is used for money laundering and transfers to-and-fro CB's accounts probably get flagged. Provided you have nothing to hide and have done nothing wrong, your bank will probably release the funds in a week.

I can't see the "mainstream" adopting it until its value stabilizes and doesn't compare itself to the USD. In order to accept BTC, you must know how valuable it is.

Doesn't the Jalapeno draw only 4.5 watts? 
Looking at [grnbrg's picture of the board]( which is a very, very simple device, you can tell 90% of the heat will be on those two processors smack tab in the middle and the other 10% will be on the voltage regulators for DC In and Fan Out, then lastly on the ATMega chip (32bit controller) on the top, if any, controlling the instructions.
The FTDI chip is likely computer interfacing and not a hoot, the capacitors at the bottom and most of the little diodes around the place aren't going to be running with much identifiable heat.
If he's dumb enough to run it with the heatsinks off, you're going to see something very close to this:

Two blocks of 300 appeared at $236... and later you'll see it'll be stuck at $239. Everything below it gets snatched up pretty quickly. I'd say at least 300 purchased this way.
Meanwhile, MTGOX's price is slightly more valuable.
Theoretically, this person is locking down the price at 236, buying at ~235.95, then transferring BTC to MTGOX and selling on there. Currently at $239, 300 BTC @ $235.95 to MTGOX's $239 is a $915 gain.
I've seen this happening for the past few hours.
Edit: That's one theory. But the goal is definitely to lock the price low, like being able to see a rise coming (the bubble growing, for example) and get as much USD in as possible right now (perhaps out of other markets?) It dropped and this group locked in at 235 now: 
Kept the Bitfloor market stuck at 236 for half an hour. Now it'll happen for 235:
