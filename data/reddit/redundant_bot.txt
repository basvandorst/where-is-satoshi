More like it costs a significant amount in energy/work to produce a Bitcoin compared to printing paper. Miners wouldn't want to sell a Bitcoin they mined for less than what it costs to produce.

I meant Bitcoin can adopt better tech from competing chains while keeping its vast users. Competing chains just makes Bitcoin better. It's like another vector of attack that Bitcoin will become resilient from.

Would users on Bitcoin rather update so their funds have new features or update to a new network and start from scratch? Either way they have to update. Blockchain is winner take all to be the network to transact on, the same way the internet won as the network for the world wide web. 
Alts are only cheap because no one is using them. Once people start using the alt then they will have slow confirmation times and high fees. To have scaling issues you need scale. 
And fees are included in order to protect the network, nothing can be free (and still have value) and fast unless it is centralized like the same old shit we have. Trust and a network takes a long time to build and Bitcoin is in the best position to be the world's currency. 
Just curious, what alt would you say has a chance to be the one the world adopts?

If the 2mb blocks fill in a week what then? It's better to focus on better solutions than to kick the can down the road. Also if we had to hardfork I don't want to upgrade for one measly 2x blocksize. We should introduce new tech with soft forks until all tech has developed and then upgrade once to include as many hardfork required upgrades possible so we won't split the network unnecessarily.

I'd go as far as to say have tails os on desktop with no network no wifi adapter, remove Ethernet, remove hard drive for good measure even though it is a privileged task. Set up multi sig wallet with one cosigner the private key made from Electrum and one from a trezor. Copy by hand the xpub to another Electrum os with networking so you can create transactions. When signing transactions/loading to be submitted to network copy by hand to avoid trusting usb firmware from potentially infecting your airgapped PC. This removes trust from relying on your hardware wallet to not have a bug in it's current firmware that's hasn't yet been discovered. Being my own bank has made me paranoid and is very stressful.

Difficulty adjustment is normal. Emergency difficulty adjustment was never apart of Satoshi's code and had to be put in for Bcash to survive. Satoshi's Bitcoin consensus rules were so thought out that we can still interact with the oldest nose software today, sending money from a segwit address to the first core client. Eda in bcash wasn't thought out and is now seeing such oscillating hash rate for Bcash that it is now in the process of rushing another hardfork. That one will probably fail too. Eda is a hack to try and save something that can't be saved. Whoever is mining bcash at a loss when it isn't profitable will run out of money sooner or later. Bcash can't be saved.

Yeah but YOU don't audit it, someone else does. Youre trusting whoever ledger pays to audit them. They could miss something an entire community could find. Sorry but I like trezors open hardware open software approach. Vulnerabilities are found and quickly patched. People are constantly looking for vulnerabilities and it gets stronger every time. Like Bitcoin. Ledger tries security by obfuscation, which is antithetical to bitcoins trust model. Ledger probably won't steal your bitcoins by why not make it open source like Bitcoin is?

Wait but the security element isn't open for the public to even audit. They source their own auditors. I mean. They probably most likely won't steal your coins but how can anyone be so sure?

Well if 80% of miners leave that means segwit 2x chain has faster blocktimes leading to users can dump faster once they split coins. Users can split coins by buying from coinbase who offers both coins and sending coins to their wallet. The price of 2x gets dumped because bitcoins value is decentralized currency and not a currency forced by corps that was made through a backroom deal. Miners switch back to the main chain because there are more users and the slower block times lead to increase in fees which is makes mining Bitcoin even more enticing. This is all hypothetical because 80% of miners won't even leave Bitcoin for a network only miners and buisnessmen are on.

No. After the fork you have 1:1 Bitcoin and segwit 2x coins. If you send your 2x coins to an exchange, without splitting, miners can copy that transaction and send your Bitcoins to that exchange.

Miners can always leave Bitcoin and mine an altcoin. If Rothschild bought mining equipment that vastly outnumbered the farms today, mined Bitcoin until the difficulty can't be mined by other farms, then proposed a hardfork where it has 40 million coins, 10gb blocksize, and fees directly to the Rothschild family, do you think people will switch? Oh but the other chain is crippled and rothcoin works! Come switch to rothcoin!! And it's possible since Rothchilds are worth from 350 billion to 2 trillion and Bitcoin network just passed 100 billion. Segwit 2x won't work. They can bleed money and let other miners make money. It will be the most expensive,hopefully last, attack on Bitcoin that test to see if miners have any say over what Bitcoin is.

But everyone receives transactions at different times. No node, mining or otherwise, knows the true time a transaction was sent vs a different transaction using the same satoshis. It is why miners are needed; they can order it into a block.
It is more likely actually that a miner includes the transaction with the higher fee, even if submitted after, than the low fee transaction.

It's more like you can transact with someone across the world in cash. It's fast and peer to peer. No forced take backsies. It's not free to use because miners have to pay electricity and users are storing all the transactions to verify the chain. So you have to pay a miner fee to prevent governments from spamming the chain so it can't be used.

I would like to say I understand Bitcoin. I mean I can't audit the code and have to trust the open source community. I know that's a big flaw. Do you guys think learning how to program just so I can verify the Bitcoin core client is worth it/easy? 
However, I keep more than 15% in bitcoin. Whatever not needed in my monthly budget I hold in Bitcoin. Not as an investment but more of taking ownership of my finances. It just makes sense to own Bitcoin than worthless paper that is decreed by the 1%. Fiat isn't my money usually (haven't seen many cash only places) and is inflated when the 1% want to print more. Also the fed has a history of underreporting inflation rates. I only care about btc/USD price as a way to gauge how much more I can buy with my coins or to illustrate value to someone who doesn't understand Bitcoin. It doesn't make sense to me to sell Bitcoin for any shitcoin, fiat included, so I hold most of my money in bitcoin. 
Everyone needs to be reminded why bitcoin is needed, it's in the Genesis block.

More that if you wait a year+. It held its value better than fiat. Fiat has an inflation rate so your purchasing power decreases. As a way to store value I think it's better than gold and definitely better than fiat. 
If it seems like an investment you should research more on the technology because if you don't understand and are in it for the price in fiat then that's just gambling.

@_date: 2018-02-06 09:00:52
Bitcoin is permissionless where you can do whatever you want with your money. You converted your time and energy into money, you should get to spend it however you please. It sucks that USD and Bitcoin are used for money laundering and other crimes. They should just catch criminals and not punish everyone else who uses it as a medium of exchange. Govs are using money as a means of control. Our forefathers in the revolutionary war probably seemed like terrorists to the British. 
 
And you can't really regulate Bitcoin. Converting from fiat is banned? Prices of Bitcoin will go up since less supply just like what happened when cocaine was banned. And an economy is still possible without new Bitcoin in circulation if we transact in satoshis. And more Bitcoin will be accumulated in other progressive countries effectively retarding ours. 
Want to track an address? We can send to our other btc wallet, convert to monero, send to our other monero wallet for paranoia, and back. A huge headache for the IRS. How can they tax anyone if there is no absolute certainty that you sent all your funds to a merchant address or an address you own? We wouldn't cash out to their system so there's no identity link. Tax evasion is bad? The Panama papers exposed the 1% for evading taxes. Now everyone's on a level playing field!
Sorry if that was long. Just grinds my gears when someone who doesn't understand the technology say Bitcoin can be regulated. I was just wondering what you had in mind specifically, not just declare it illegal but how can it be enforable. Ok I guess you can say a government can EMP every square inch to take down the internet. But hopefully one of you guys kept a Bitcoin ledger in a faradays cage.

Cash app/ coin base has pretty fast sell for usd. And gold is a relic. Old store of value. When I need fiat it seems very difficult to sell gold compared to how easy it is to sell Bitcoin. I mean actually selling not transferring a receipt for one. Bitcoin is better ,imo, than all your suggestions. 
Sure it's volatile but it's more of I'm selling my "earlier" coins so I don't see it as going up or down in value: I view it as I'm using less and less old coins and no matter what the value has increased. 
I know TA is kind of bullshit, but Bitcoin is finite. It is the world's most fair money. It's easy to lose your keys forever. I don't see demand dropping anytime soon and so I truly believe Bitcoin will go up in value. Day to day, sure it can "crash'.  Bitcoin is either going to  zero or moon and the world needs a currency like Bitcoin so hopefully moon.
Bitcoin will succeed as long as the majority of the users are greedy and value decentralization.

Wait wait.
IF there was a next generation of blockchain that had a revolutionary technology that Bitcoin doesn't have,
Users of Bitcoin, which there are a lot of and dwarf every other network, have two choices:
They upgrade to this new blockchain and start from scratch.
They update their Bitcoin core node that implements this revolutionary technology because it's open source. If it changes consensus rules then it would be an upgrade to a hard forked chain. 
Regardless users would have to upgrade and they would rather upgrade and keep their stash than to have to upgrade and start over. Technology doesn't stand still in open source software- natural selection for the best code.

Usb can have it's own firmware without you knowing. Most usbs don't have open source hardware and software documentation. 
Hardware wallets are just for convenience. You can always write down the transaction by hand back and forth from an offline comp and an online one to broadcast but that's time consuming but I don't know if uh and more error prone imo. 
Also you have to make sure the device is always used offline. Not just unplug the Ethernet. So a trezor on Amazon is $85 right now and is cheaper than a computer.

No research more as to why you're wrong. Medical records? If they are centralized then they should just use an excel file that syncs. The whole point is decentralization. And smart contracts are vaporware. How can a blockchain know about external conditions/the outside world without hosting the universe in the chain or relying in centralized oracles. Oracles of which are ultimately inputted by humans. When a smart contract is about to execute the loser can try and game the oracles to save his money.
@_date: 2018-02-20 12:51:25

If gov bans all exchanges there will still be enough units to transact. And coins will be worth more due to scarcity; like when cocaine prices increased after it was deemed illegal.
Also can't one send money to a friend in another country to buy coins for them? Or say a business that charges a fee for them to buy coins to send to their customers? But label it as video game currency exchange like virwox? In that case the gov loses out on money from fees but whatever their loss.
And if they haven't banned legal offranps people can still avoid taxes with the send all funds to your own wallet &gt; decentralized crypto exchange for monero &gt; monero wallet (with a mixin of 10 / send to another monero wallet you own if you're paranoid) &gt; Bitcoin wallet. How will IRS know if the first wallet to wallet transfer be: from you to you, from you to merchant (you don't pay taxes for the remaining coins), gift from you to friends(they should pay taxes on the coins from now on), or from you to exchange if the exchange utilizes different receive address for each transaction( which I'm pretty sure they do?)?
In the case that they do manage to find out you sent money to yourself and to an exchange to be converted to monero, how will they tax you then? No one has been able to trace a single monero transaction that they weren't given the transaction id for. No one, not even the FBI when they confiscated those drug websites, were able to analyze the entire monero ledger. I'm sure monero is the go to for crypto laundering until the day comes when there is no off ramp and everyone just transact in bitcoin.
I mean the rich have gotten away with tax avoidance and when the average person understands that Bitcoin is the world's most fair money in terms of issuance, decentralized control, AND they can avoid taxes like the big boys, is when I think it will be mainstream.

Well when accounting for energy efficiency you need energy per value/price. Well fiat money decreases in value from increased supply. Why spend the same energy when the value of it goes toward zero? Most fiat currencies have lost 95-99% of their original value.
Inflation is a shitty idea imo. Why should money supply increase over the value of the token increasing? In the current environment its because it's easy if you are the only one having access to the printing machine.

No I don't have to trust anyone. I don't have to upgrade my node software. Blockstream can't force me. And it's not 3 people. It's 3 mining pools that includes hundreds of people. I guess I do have to trust that they are rational and would rather earn Bitcoin than to destroy it.  But my point still stands. I don't want to trust unnecessarily complex contracts that can still be manipulated. Its in the soon to be losers best interest to try and cheat the oracles. It's  an attack vector that is fair play. Also contract has to be understood by code and by it's social intentions? 
Blockchain advantages is decentralized consensus. not having certain entities having more trust than others. 
Bitcoin requires no trust. Unless you can't read code, I guess.
Ethereum requires more trust for input conditions for it's smart contract, along with validating code if you don't program. At that point why not use traditional systems that require trust?

So they must have dedicated mining to move the blocks of transactions within their own private chain? They should just use Bitcoin to move funds in their own wallets. And eth transaction rates are similar to Bitcoin since one Bitcoin transaction has many inputs and outputs which ethereum counts as individual transactions.
Bitcoin is the base layer and you can just build on top of it. It is the most secured, widely used, and has first mover advantage. TCP/IP wasn't the best but since everyone was on it that became the internet. It is a winner take all system  due to it being open source; if a chain has a revolutionary idea to add, the users in the network would have to either upgrade to that new cryptocurrency and start over from scratch or upgrade to the hardfork that preserves their balance.

What do you see that has actual use cases? Because I thought that only monero and eth have unique use cases.
 But imo eth is vaporware as smart contracts can't be fully decentralized, the whole purpose of a block chain, without centralized oracles or the data being embedded into the block chain itself. Never mind the dao fiasco that undermined code that ran no matter what even though only 4% consensus hardforked to reroll the transactions.

Decentralized exchanges like bisq that doesn't need a token? Also decentralized exchanges is the weakest link of ethereum. Isn't still possible to cheat in say the decentralized betting ( which is most stocks/futures stuff) when it is more economically feasible to bribe the decentralized oracles, which has a human input the data, than to lose in the bet?
Also ethereum is centralized imo. Premined and the dao fiasco showed how 4% consensus, no vote means vote for status quo of no hard fork, can hard fork a network to re roll transactions. A bailout because people didn't want to wait or read code. The code is law that will always run no matter what has already been broken. The dao did what it was coded to do, allow a user to withdraw more funds than he put in. 
I still think ethereum is vaporware. Even in the example of a decentralized Uber where it pays a driver when he drives from point a to point b verified by GPS, how does the blockchain know a customer was in the car or not? 
Or say decentralized buying of goods. If funds were released automatically when a tracking number says delivered how does the blockchain know if the correct product has been delivered and not an empty box? 
Without storing all of the universe inside the blockchain it can't know without a human inputting data into oracles, even a network of oracles can be manipulated.

I don't want to compromise with what I, a user, wants. There is no compromising with businesses. They can either help the users and make money or get out of the game and let others make money. The slip up occurs iff we have to follow the whims of the minority group.

You also have to account for inflation from all those fractional reserves and the money created to start wars and then Bitcoin doesn't seem that bad

Of course. But if the majority of users are on a hard forked coin then that is Bitcoin as well by social consensus. As it stands Bitcoin is Bitcoin. Bch is bcash lol
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:24:32
Same. Are you splitting at the fork? Also if coinbase has two tokens and we buy one won't sending those coins to your wallet split them?
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:07:38
So I had the same feeling and probably others will share the same. Except I felt I should wait for the price to go to $700 and not the current price of $750... Don't have to trust me when I say buy now and hodl but I know you'll eventually realize, as I and many others, thay it is always a good time to buy if you hodl long term.

Easiest is coinbase. Transfer to Bitcoin core wallet, Electrum. Samourai, bitcoin core wallet, or Electrum mobile for Android. Breadwallet for iOS. Mobile wallets aren't as secure as the full node wallet and even then you could have malware on a Windows machine. Being your own bank makes you paranoid about security.

Yeah that seems like slavery if allowed to happen. I guess if prices decrease for the things you buy would apply to houses. To the point where you don't need debt to buy it. Call me crazy but they'd just buy a house in one go. I mean like distant future.

From the chain link white paper


tion. No service provider is unconditionally trustworthy. Even the best-intentioned
may be buggy or hacked. So there is no way to for a user or smart contract to have
absolute assurance that a service ORACLE will carry out its instructions faithfully.
ChainLink reasons about its security protocols in terms of this ideal functionality
ORACLE. Our goal in ChainLink is to achieve a real world system with properties
as close as possible to those of ORACLE under realistic ***trust*** assumptions. 
So yeah there is no 100% proof that it will be true. Unlike it Bitcoin we all know for 100% certainty the order of the ledger. They are just using multiple oracles so that one can't be compromised but what if a loser was about to lose and he found it was better to start paying people to input his preferred outcome into their oracles, because oracles are updated by humans.  The smart contract doesn't care because it sees that x has occurred and it does y things.
And again I think it's funny that chain link in their first paragraph mentioned this:


Even though the dao hardforked with 4% consensus and the dao itself was interfered with it's execution since the hacker had his funds locked from a soft fork.

Safer to hold Bitcoin than Bitcoin cash. Bitcoin cash has such low difficulty compared to bitcoin that miners can easily reorg the bcash chain.

Best thing is tails OS with persistence and no network. It's like a hardware wallet in essence but more cumbersome. If on Android: Samourai, Electrum, Bitcoin core wallet are trustworthy. Samourai looks nice and you shouldn't store a lot on mobile wallets anyways
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:44:41
It wasn't contentious and had one chain after. Everyone moved to the new one. Bitcoin is immutable in that it wasn't hard forked to reroll a certain transaction. It was to fix a bug that granted more bitcoin than the supply. Also it wasn't a pure hard fork because apparently you can make the old version work with Bitcoin today. 
 With the dao no bugs were fixed but a transaction. Nothing wrong with the network just that one transaction. It was re rolled and was a contentious hard fork so had two chains after.
Mind you Bitcoin could not have come up with consensus to re roll the mt gox hack. Something that ethereum has proven it can do.

Any cool features can be coded into Bitcoin .
If users had to upgrade to a new network or upgrade their nodes from a Bitcoin hardfork they would rather upgrade their Bitcoin nodes to keep their coins and not start over. Do you agree?

When BTC goes down, alts go down against USD because they are traded primarily against BTC
When BTC goes up, alts go down against BTC because traders FOMO back into the mothership
When BTC goes sideways, traders get bored and alts go up

I understand that users give coins the value. That's​ why I air quoted consensus; we only use their software to dump our coins. I'm suggesting we let them think they won in order to get a higher price for our 2x coins so we can convert it back to Bitcoin. If they want to pretend 2x is Bitcoin then we should be able to sell our 2x coins  for bitcoins price. We then leave them playing by themselves on their network.
@_date: 2017-10-25 09:38:46
Not an upgrade to me. I'll gladly sell my 2x coins for $5000+ if coinbase wants to call it bitcoin. Whoever splits their couns first gets more money
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:59:42
Yup the trezor is open source hardware and software. And nope the ledger has a security element that is not auditable. They state it's for security but it's don't trust verify.

Best advice is to not sell. Why would you rather trade ~~redeemable for gold~~ paper for digital gold? Bitcoin is digital gold in that it holds value. You use your shitty fiat paper until you don't have anymore and only break out your gold to sell when you need to survive. Be like a dwarf and hoard gold you fool.

@_date: 2018-02-22 05:20:05
Proof of stake doesn't work. Period. A new node that is syncing for the first time can't tell which is the correct chain. Try to prove that wrong.
Anonymity is taken care of by monero.
Cheap and fast can't be done on base layer but is taken care of by lightning network on Bitcoin.
Asic resistance is a joke. It is only asic resistance because it's price doesn't warrant making Asics for it. If it was valuable they can mine it with Asics. 
DAG is centralized as shit. Iota needs a coordinator? 
Dencentealized exchange like bisq that doesn't need a token?
Yeah most coins are shit. The only real cases for cryptocurrency/blockchain is currency. And monero is good for now when exchanges are needed to convert fiat to Bitcoin. When everyone uses Bitcoin we don't really need to break the link of identification.

The vote was open for like an hour. Most people didn't vote which should count for a no hardfork following the status quo.

@_date: 2017-10-31 14:13:34
Right? That's like if bitcoin had a portion not auditable. "Just trust us" is antithetical to Bitcoin.

Monero maybe. The rest are shit imo

Bitcoin is one of the biggest open source projects.
@_date: 2017-10-29 18:44:43
No. They are within their economic game theory. But what they are proposing is antithetical to bitcoins core value of not having authority forcing monetary policies on users.
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:36:03
What about tails os?
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:21:04
I guess op thinks it as gold miners getting a high when striking gold. But gambling in the long term you lose. Is that the same for Bitcoin mining?
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:58:27
You can sell bcash for more Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:29:55
Me too? Lol

As long as the price is less than Bitcoin segwit 2x will never succeed. I hope it goes all the way up to Bitcoin - $1 so I can sell for my Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:28:27

Satoshi rolls off my tongue. Idk I like both.
@_date: 2018-02-15 02:34:41
And I disagree again. Myspace is an application on a network. Bitcoin is the network. Since any crypto would be open source, ANY new innovative design would be forked into Bitcoin. If any coin has a major breakthrough then users in Bitcoin have two choices:
Upgrade to new coin network and start over from scratch.
Upgrade Bitcoin core. If it can't be soft forked it can be hard forked and users would rather hard fork to it and keep their coins than to start over.
Alts are nice so things can be tested on them and not on Bitcoin. Bitcoin is anti fragile and when you try to kill it it becomes stronger.
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:34:41
It really is a pump and dump wcheme for.miners to make money. New users should put off investing in it.
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:28:32
Op disagrees with you...
@_date: 2018-03-05 07:40:40
How is it human proof if it needs a central coordinator? Why can't it just be decentralized?
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:36:36
Well when Bitcoin succeeds to fend off attacks you'd regret not buying in at a cheap price. The fighting comes from companies trying to control money one last time.
@_date: 2017-10-25 09:54:05
I don't want miners in charge of the rules period. 2x is a fedcoin. I mean I'll take it thanks and I'll sell it for Bitcoin prices if anyways wants it.
@_date: 2017-10-29 17:07:51
Well miners don't dictate consensus rules. They work for the users.
@_date: 2018-02-22 18:40:14
I think for people like me who believe in the tech, it doesn't make sense to trade your valuable bitcoins for a shitcoin like fiat."ooh I can buy more of a shitcoin." It just makes more sense to store my value in Bitcoin. If I really really need fiat I can convert back.
@_date: 2018-03-03 11:59:10
How come Electrum has medium privacy and no extra services compared to the other wallet?
@_date: 2017-10-25 10:20:06
Waiting for the dip...
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:01:58
If you had to ask you're new here.
LN stands for lightning network
Some others you may need:
Bcash (BCH) means bcash, lol. The coin that pretends to be Bitcoin (BTC). There will only be one Bitcoin and it is named Bitcoin.
Hodl means hodl. You say it like a pokemon. So if you see hodl you say hodl or if you see something worth hodl you say hodl. Hodl
@_date: 2017-10-29 17:23:11
There was no proposal stage. Just Corp CEOs in a room trying to force it on users with their money.
@_date: 2017-10-28 21:49:55
Tbh most cryptos are scams. Iota isn't even a blockchain. And ripple is centralized. And dash. And Bitcoin cash.
@_date: 2017-10-25 10:09:32
Well of course, sooner you do the more money you get. But if corporate companies want to call their shitcoins Bitcoin then I can sell it at Bitcoin prices.
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:23:34
Companies can afford to buy shills.
@_date: 2017-10-29 00:24:44
Yup if miners control what token you use is akin to the rich/those in control enforcing what currency you use.
@_date: 2017-10-29 17:44:52
As evil as the bankers today that people who choose Bitcoin try to get away from.
@_date: 2018-03-01 13:23:37
That poster was right. Segwit just makes blocks more efficient leading to lower fees. It can be fast if the mempool is low but transaction time will be like before, ten minute blocks on average. Lightning will be off chain and won't be limited by the 10 minute block average
@_date: 2017-10-28 14:34:00
Controversial tin foil hat time: Is this a way to get hashrate back to Bitcoin so bcash chain doesn't have such a high increase in difficulty?
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:31:46
If NYA is a rushed hardfork, bcash is hardforking in two weeks and was announced yesterday.
@_date: 2017-10-29 17:06:09
Split your coins fast to get more bitcoins!
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:00:41
If I want to trade value between me and another user I just need me and another user. Bankers want to be middlemen that rob users of fees along the way and print more money which can't reliably be audited which devalues my holding and thus silently robbing me.
@_date: 2018-02-20 02:59:59
I don't think you can install tailsos on floppy disk. Are regular disks safe?
@_date: 2017-10-28 22:01:06
Fiat money. The longer you hodl Bitcoin the more fiat money you can get and buy whatever you want that accepts fiat. It's similar to gold in that regard but faster confirmation times and cheaper fees.
@_date: 2017-10-29 18:46:06
Not evil. I guess I would want to control money if I was in their shoes. Just that they are the shitty bankers we try to escape from.
@_date: 2018-02-22 00:45:04
They limit how much you can take out? Sounds like what happened in Venuzuela.
@_date: 2017-10-28 22:16:04
Deleted comment
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:23:47
Same. Are you splitting at the fork? Also if coinbase has two tokens and we buy one won't sending those coins to your wallet split them?
@_date: 2017-10-25 12:35:19
Definitely not ethereum. Vaporware. Turing complete sucks as a smart contract scripting language. Smart contracts require an Oracle that can be gamed. The dao fiasco proved code is mutable if you're friends with vitalik. So far the best dapp is their ICO maker. Bitcoin can code whatever smart contract ethereum can, in the sense of making a contract run decentralized.
@_date: 2017-10-28 15:12:55
Oh fuck yes
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:53:09
It becomes centralized when we keep hardforking for a silly reason. 8mb is still too small for Visa level transactions. We need 10 gb blocks to keep up at peak Visa levels. Companies just want to have control over money one last time.
@_date: 2017-10-29 17:06:38
What why
@_date: 2017-10-28 14:15:38
And fiat inflation in general is robbing you silently.

How can you be sure that they don't reuse the gift card codes?

Yes they own the private keys but they don't verify their own ledger in a trustless way.

To make sure you didn't receive a counterfeit, hold both buttons when you plug it in and go to trezor.io/start ( double check that link). Also this is for when you first initiate, you will lose funds if you didn't back up your seed.

Businesses were made to accommodate Bitcoin users. Miners were formed to accommodate Bitcoin users. If all Bitcoin users moved on to a new chain, companies and miners will follow to accommodate the users.

Can I spam comments?
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:59:00
Achieves consensus among users. Which it does not. There seems to be an upcoming attack coordinated by miners and businesses to force users. They want to cripple the chain users are using with the hopes of users giving up and using their chain. It will fail but it is an attempted attack regardless.
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:21:40
It dips, it climbs, but on a long enough scale it skyrockets.

Yeah I mean I guess you have the other private keys in a will to your family but what happens if the dad dies or something.

Always Hodl. If you can, buy. If you must, sell. Only sell if you really really need money to survive.
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:24:30
No, no one was going to accept them. I was just going to split and use changelly/shapeshift to get whatever I can for 2x. I don't really care as it is worth 0 to me.

Beauty of open source. Ledger does have a closed sourced security element in the firmware that pushed me towards the trezor.

It's for science, just running algorithms to find um uhh prime numbers is all. Oh how do I pay for electricity? Well I get donations for science you know. People like their numbers. Oh you want to tax me for donations? Um uhh shit I lost my private keys. This Bitcoin thing is just so complicated I don't really understand it...
