I didn't realize they would have such a premium. I thought perhaps 2% or so, which I don't think would be excessive.
I don't use Coinbase because it's too slow. Coinbase Consumer makes me wait 30 days for some reason to get access to my funds, and though Coinbase Pro is faster, it currently limits me to $250 per week.
I think currently what I will do is use Abra to transfer it from my bank (far higher limits than Coinbase) and then convert to BTC. If Coinbase Pro ever lifts my limits I'll just use them.
This was mostly an experiment to see how it worked and how practical it would be.

I may end up doing that. I had no idea they would charge such a high exchange rate. I could see ~1%, which I've paid to some services like Cash App and Abra, but 3.5% seems excessive.

I actually didn't find my work through them. I just added my employer as an external source, and Bitwage gives me banking information. I add that banking information to my direct deposit info with my employer and they treat it like any other bank.

So what? I make around $100K, I live on maybe half of it, I can afford some volatility. When it comes back up, I'll regain all that and more.
Plus only about 60% is in bitcoin, so that 3% isn't out of my entire income.

Thanks. Currently I've memorized the seed, but I plan on finding some way to braille it out for more secure storage.

That's my concern as well.
@_date: 2018-08-16 17:24:33
Would that be safer than the offline option I described? I thought about using that as well.

Yes I live in the US. Why isn't it realistic here?

Awesome, I'm excited for that. I've never used a Raspberry Pi, so instructions for getting it all working together would be helpful as well.

Sorry, as I said in the post, I'm visually impaired. Neither of those options will work.

Are you still doing this? I was thinking about investing 40% in Vanguard, about 50% in crypto, and about 10% liquid in my bank account for things I have to pay cash for, like rent, or my wife's spending who doesn't use crypto. I have a Shift card to spend from my bitcoin balance.

No, it's offline, and I just use it to sign transactions, then broadcast with the online computer.

It was initially meant to be used for my side business, but business has been slow and I've mostly been using my main computer.
Is it enough just to not connect it to the internet anymore? I currently can't buy a whole new computer just for this. The offline computer is an iMac, just to clarify.
@_date: 2018-08-16 20:41:34
A little more complicated than that.
@_date: 2018-08-17 12:11:21
That's a really awesome demo, thanks! Any timeframe on this one? I am also the one who contacted you on Github, and I believe you said it was close to completion.

Computers are accessible. There's software that reads out text, called a screen reader. Can also use an iPhone for the same reason. But a hardware wallet wouldn't include text to speech.

Text to speech software on a computer. It'll speak out whatever I want to read. And touch typing doesn't require vision.
