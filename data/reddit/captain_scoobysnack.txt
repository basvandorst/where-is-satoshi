Bitcoin isn't going to stay the gold standard by doing nothing. If there's another coin that works better and gains adoption people will eventually move to it. People who aren't in crypto yet wont care that bitcoin was first.

It means after bitcoin you like to use hoodies. Or you become a sith lord. One of the two I think.

It's still early days. You can bet almost every country in the world will be moving to digital transactions for practically every purchase. That's when bitcoin/crypto will really shine. 
Few people knew how the internet worked when it first came out either. It needed to be made easy to use before mass adoption. Now my dad can use it because he just has to touch an icon of what he wants to do.

He's always been pro segwit. He's just not claiming it's going to fix everything. I agree it's not a very good analogy though.

...but he is...

That reminded me to check for the old coins I had stashed in my drawer. Found it!

I think it was uasf that forced their hand. It takes all power away from them. When charlie started calling for uasf, they all lined up to support segwit. They're only doing it now to avoid it on bitcoin too.

Consesus meeting was just them trying to save face. They got all the miners and Charlie on a video call and called it a round table and basically said ok you win.

So litecoin isn't a currency?

A good payment system that no one uses... Sounds like bitcoin in the early years.

Isn't that exactly what bitcoin was in the early years?

Wow the bias here is strong. I really don't care. I don't have loyalty to any one coin. It's pretty obvious what took place, if you want to keep thinking that then go ahead.
