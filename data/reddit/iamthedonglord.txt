I didn't say it wasn't working. I was clearly asking if these fees were going to stay this way, because if they are there is no incentive for someone buying bitcoin to buy a product to not use an altcoin.

I'm asking a question what does that mean

Also read the other comments to see it's not useable for every person lol

Not necessarily day to day, but any purchase comes with this insane fee so it's not viable in any scenario. Which I thought was the point of bitcoin, to overcome fiat currencies and become a widely used decentralized currency.

I'm not sure as to what segwit is, I don't know much about the coin's technicalities I'm an infrequent user.

Electrum is the one I’ve been using which has the high fees

45 percent upvoted I came here for more knowledge lmao I don't care but it's indicative of a community

i always thought one of the key aspects of bitcoin was 1. Decentralization and 2. Privacy so I was wondering since XMR is superior in the second part of that it would be a more viable coin. Do you think too much privacy is something that isn't viable for altcoins in the long run?

So the fees will go back down? Why/How 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:43:15
Who/when do you think the line will be drawn? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:15:31
I understand that, but bitcoin USED to be more useful then it is currently in terms of purchasing everyday items when a shop allows you to, now due to fees and timing it's near impossible unless you want to way overpay for your product. I came here to try to figure out if this was temporary or what

You're a fucking dick. I don't know much about the coin so I bought some and chose the fee within 5 blocks for $300 transaction using electrum and got a like 60$ fee. Explain yourself instead of being a dick. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:42:05
i use electrum to have it cleared in 5 blocks 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:42:15
electrum 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:12:15
That will cut my transaction fees in half? Any suggestions? Why do people always recommend electrum to me?

Is going through their support the only way I can obtain my identifier? 
@_date: 2015-10-27 23:16:48
they said if i give them my ip and date of account creation and stuff they can get it back so that doesn't sound true 
@_date: 2015-10-27 22:52:46
it was ;( 
I'm sure if i talk to them enough they will give me the identifier, I don't understand I've got the password why they would not give it to me
