I think bitcoin is going up, but your risk reward gets skewed by taxes on gains, don’t forget to factor that in. Also, I would buy Ethereum or another reliable altcoin, gains will be significantly larger.

You only have to be right once — about something so simple and clear as the future of cryptocurrency and you will have such outsized gains relative to general investment strategies. Someone can be a star hedge fund manager and have a mere fraction of your returns while you sit on 10x upside vs 0.5x downside risk/reward with bitcoin. In my opinion, any part of your portfolio not in cryptocurrency (BTC &amp; ETH) is a mistake.
