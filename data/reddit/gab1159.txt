I am french canadian so no problem here. How's yours??
@_date: 2014-01-12 09:22:33
Are you from Montreal? Why wait for the summer :P
I am dying to get a bitcoin ATM here. If you are serious about it and looking for a partner, let me know as I would be very interested in working on such a bitcoin-related project here in Montreal. It's a shame we have the Bitcoin Embassy but no actual working ATM. Montreal is already a tech-oriented city and to me it is a natural place for bitcoins to florish and thrive. 
Seeing how well the Vancouver ATM is doing and how "hard" new-comers find it to buy bitcoins, an ATM machine would be an instinctive go-to place to acquire bitcoins if there is enough exposure! 
Anyways, let me know if you are interested in leading the way ;)

They won't be able to withdraw. CaVirtex asks for proof of residency, so unless you are willing to declare false information about yourself, which in this case I believe would be illegal, changing the IP won't do much. 
I'm Canadian and using VPNs, and CaVirtex once blocked my account because they wanted to know why it appeared I was login in from different countries. Once I explained I was on a VPN, they whitelisted me and unblocked my account under an hour after sending my explanation.

I bookmarked it!
@_date: 2014-01-13 05:10:07
Alright I'm keeping that in mind :)
@_date: 2014-01-13 05:09:05
Yes no problem. I haven't really used reddit as a poster before commenting on this thread (registered specifically for that :P ), but I guess it's not rocket science neither!

So because we can't push our flawed solution enough we'll just start discrediting Bitcoin.
Pathetic.

Libre Office has the same features though

They don't even come close to understanding crypto lol

Fake polls. Fake news.

That remains to be proven.
@_date: 2017-01-27 20:09:27
Sometimes you need a tx to go right through. I've lost money once because of the backlog, not doing that again. So when the backlog is full, I just wait for it to clear, and that sucks. Good thing I like crypto so much because this is NOT a pleasant state.
Bitcoin used to be so simple and effective....
@_date: 2017-01-22 00:21:04
No you didn't
@_date: 2016-12-31 19:50:56
Seriously people need to stop using Excel and Microsoft Office product. Everything written in files can be accessed by the NSA through xKeyscore in real time. Go watch the Snowden Hollywood movie (not the actual interview) and you'll see just how invasive Office is. 
People should start using Libre Office which is the same as MO but fully open-source and free.
 Now imagine if you paste private keys on Office....just no!

Hmm that may make sense. Need to double check on that then.
@_date: 2017-01-31 23:22:50
No I'd rather wait than pay unnecessary high fees.

You just don't see it. He violated countless Reddit rules.
@_date: 2017-01-22 21:32:50
Highly deceptive
@_date: 2016-12-05 22:19:03
To be honest, he asked for this. I'm a part time lurker in bitcoin subs and don't even have much of an opinion on big blocks vs segwit...but he always come off like that kid who shitposts all day. Very unprofessional for him to be so openly and emotionally invested in debates filled mostly with rhetoric and hollow points. Both sides are doing this, but it's very unprofessional to see him act like an aggressive troll.
@_date: 2016-11-24 09:52:17

Trump is going to bring back a gold standard and soar BTC to Pluto
@_date: 2016-12-28 21:51:08
This is one of the biggest shills in crypto lately. He will pump coins he previously invested in and generally trolls and spew misinformation on social medias. Sometimes, what he says makes sense and he is right, but most of the time it is clear he has his own motives and an agenda. 
Barry is a tool.

Litteraly a quote from the video:
"If you are too stupid to believe Google over ME"
Seriously though, OneCoin is an obvious scam, why is this guy still free?
@_date: 2016-09-09 20:55:00
Because futures trading is fun and potentially very profitable.
@_date: 2016-09-22 16:34:33
I'm still interested by crypto and its leading coin even though I believe it's going downhill. Waiting to see if they fork/find a reliable solution.

@_date: 2016-09-05 03:37:43
I think that it may be for something like proof-of-existence? 
"Proof of Existence is just taking the hash of something and storing that hash in the Blockchain. Since the Blockchain stores all of the transactions confirmed and all hashes are unique, once that transaction is confirmed, it can be referenced again to prove that a particular document exists."
From 
Factom is a blockchain-based company for provably hosting files on its system, and it keeps hashes of every files uploaded anchored to the Bitcoin blockchain. Both Factom and MegaUpload 2.0 seem to operate in the same business...more or so. 
MegaUpload 2.0 would get its bitcoins from the premium account registration fees, and use a portion of it to generate micro-transactions that identify files uploaded on the platform.
I do see that as pointless though, they'd need to be much more than a cloud company to make any feature like this worth using, maybe they really are going for a reward system on who attracts who to the website. 
@_date: 2016-09-21 18:43:37
But couldn't the same apply to BTC? The more BTCs you have, the more mining equipement you can acquire. We're seeing a big centralization problem with BTC and China right now

@_date: 2016-09-11 22:26:55
? 
That moment = non-event. Anyone can move coins around and have it shown on the blockchain. 256 btc is not even a lot of money, it is pennies in the btc world. What's even the point of that link? Are you new to btc or something?
"That moment" that you will see everyday if  you stick your eyes to the blockchain.
@_date: 2016-09-22 06:14:33
What? No. 
@_date: 2016-09-19 10:00:35
An Ethereum smart contract would be more appropriate for that! Have a look on and ask about it, a dev may even pick the project up!

Try to create a PoS algorithm from scratch, Einstein, then tell me how "easy peasy" it is ;)
@_date: 2016-09-27 20:35:14
To be fair it does matter. If he's been doing this for 15+ years, the fact that he is still doing it right now doesn't hint to the fact that he'd be bearish on the global economy
@_date: 2016-09-08 17:41:22
Why not just use a cold wallet with strong encryption? Brainwallets are a recipe for disaster waiting to happen sometime in your life.

Expert on ranting and very extravagant personality. He did launch the MaxCoin live on his show and that failed horribly aha! 
He can be fun to watch at times but other times he's just irritating because he's gone on a rant for 5 minutes +
@_date: 2016-09-19 10:07:53
That's why the Ethereum Foundation supports and actively work on 3 different clients at the same time. Geth crashed but Parity nodes were okay for example (which makes the tweet false as not all nodes crashed).
Also, this is why Eth developper keep saying the project is NOT release ready and should be considered a beta or even an alpha. 
Ethereum keeps pushing the limit of blockchain technology, so of course it will meet obstacles and failures, but it is only because it is doing what no other dev team did before.
@_date: 2016-09-30 19:51:03
Wow what a load of freakin bullshit. They can all burn and ho bankrupt in the coming global economic crash.
We, crypto lovers and also gold bugs, will one day look at them suffer the consequences of their acts and feel good while our crypto portfolio increases in value :)

Ethereum + Bitcoin is money ruling I think

Yeah that's another problem. He doesn't have much credibility anymore other than the fact that he runs a show on a popular television news network.

I've been waiting for this for years. Too much ZH reading will make you want to watch the world burn just so you can say you called it ;)
@_date: 2016-09-22 05:06:08
Bitcoin is not fun or practical to use in its current state, so bad that I sold all my holdings months ago and enjoying other better, more innovative crypto project. The Core dev team and childish community is also part of the reasons I quit BTC.
Not trolling at all, but I think Bitcoin is dead or is dying. Better cryptos are coming out and starting to get real corporate interest, and I'm really not talking simply about Ethereum!
@_date: 2016-09-12 03:58:57
Oh that's cool! It can even make for a nice screensaver of some sort
