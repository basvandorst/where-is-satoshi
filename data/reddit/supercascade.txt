Shame you can't sticky this to the top of this subreddit until they fix this.

I'm a bit new to the cryptocoin landscape, but is there something in the  works for making a cryptocoin payment processor for vendors? A card payment is basically a little box connected to the internet. 
The hardware can't be too difficult to spec out, and the software could be opensource? I'd rather see the companies that are making crypto ATMs use those funds for a vendor payment system.

Guess I can use !b instead of !g from now on. Didn't even think !b would work but it does :)

but won't DNS just then rewrite the code in etherium thus running etherium in DNS on etherium under DNS?

there's about 13 million bitcoins mined. 1 trillion dollars shows up. demand, supply, ????, profit?

wow that's even worse. I've been with them for just a few weeks and always assumed Cavirtex was the name AND web address. Thanks for making me double check.

Haven't used them yet though. I've been using Cavirtex and so far no horror stories, although I didn't keep anything on Cavirtex until they implemeted 2FA which they now have.
@_date: 2014-04-05 16:11:55
I think you mean Cavirtex's good name?

Big props to Maidsafe making it to RT news! Once OpenBazaar get's a similar plug it will add to the momentum that is decentralization.

I think they blundered twice. First not having it the defacto standard on  iOS and Android, secondly for tacking it on and being too late for anyone to care anymore.
@_date: 2014-12-12 03:08:09
Yup, the gist of it is this. Mossad did 9/11, if middle america found out, it would be open season on jews. The end.

All of us. For every new person we introduce to bitcoin, they introduce another. For every time we ask a merchant, 'do you accept bitcoin?' we seed that idea into their heads. For every detractor of bitcoin, they inadvertently spread the message too.

Godammit it's gonna take 4 days to transfer $ to the exchanges.... BTC already jumped 20 fucking dollars.

The advantages are that you are taking business away from credit companies without having to hand over that power to some other shit-heels. That's good enough for me. Whenever I see this stupid argument against using bitcoin I wish you could all grasp the advantages of taking power away from these financial corps.

I'm guessing that the connection he's making is there will be an increase in interest to move towards bitcoin.

There's a party that will tell the Euro to fuck off if they come into power. If they begin the process of leaving the Euro it's quite possible that the value of the Euro will drop. However this is a simplistic explanation.

Front page headline, 'Dollars promote the use of cocaine!' People that have been using these new dollar note things say it's for true value, however nearly every dollar note in circulation so far has been found to have traces of cocaine. I don't want my children touching these things! These Dol-tards must be stopped.
