You will notice that often there is talk about "a route".
What this means is that in order for you to pay for your coffee, you can't just address the merchant directly, you need to find a number of 3rd parties that can facilitate your transaction. This is likely more than one chained.  Hence my reference to 4th etc.

No, you are incorrect. Easy to check for instance by the fact that you can't use bitcoin addresses to send your key to another person. There may be some likeness to bitcoin, but your LN transaction can't be offered to a miner. Hence its not a bitcoin transaction.

Read what newspapers etc promise and then tell me if you think he did too

Instead you make every node carry every store's full set of products, and push a new transaction whenever a change in price has to be published?  That sounds like a really bad way to spam the blockchain with non-transactional data.

Please explain how that is better than my debit card.  I don't really understand how dealing with an (semi-)anonymous 3rd party should make me fuzzy and warm inside.
I asked my mom and she said she'd rather do payment via a bank than someone she never met before.
Naturally, not having a 3rd party was what made Bitcoin great. It avoids all these questions.

Is a governmental 3-letter-acronym pushing you to "make the right decision for our country" ?

Bitcoin is the foundations that LN is planned to be build on top of. Just because you build on top of something doesn't make it the same.
If you build and run an app on Windows, I think MS will strongly disagree if you sell it as "it is Windows".

&lt;pedantic I_am_sorry="yes"&gt;
Apple never open sources their operating system or related stuff.
They just publish the documentation, absolutely no sources

Bitcoin is trustless. Lightning is not.
If you doubt this, then consider why Adam Black wrote;

There clearly is no need for insurance if you are right, and the owner of Blockstream says otherwise.  I belief him.

Most people ended up buying Bitcoin for reasons like it being an investment strategy or because they liked the idea of there being less control.  
Many liked the idea of not having a 3rd party.
Essentially all the benefits of Bitcoin don't apply to LN. You add 3rd (4th etc etc) parties to every transaction, after-all...
I will be quite surprised what the reasons are for people to start using LN. Why is it better than your debit card?

What is the actual thing shipped? An app? For which operating system(s)? Actual hardware?
We need to know! :)

Except for the last sentence.
@_date: 2015-12-15 12:29:22
You can't really compare it to Bitcoin; Bitcoin has advantages over the banks and the libertarians like it. LN doesn't get buy-in on any of that. Its likely going to be more risky and more expensive than your debit card.  
Who, other than some geeks, will want to use it?

The main reason is that SegWit is made to be a soft fork with such force, that it is extremely over complex. A better solution already exists that is 1/10th of the lines of code.


I have not seen any evidence of that.
@_date: 2016-09-12 16:19:55
You seem to agree with OP, if you read the conclusion he says the same thing.


@_date: 2016-09-12 16:17:50


Maybe you missed the point that SPV wallets currently do exactly that. They share other peoples node. 


 You don't have to do this, nobody is making you. You may want to relax a little, OP was making a suggestion, not forcing anyone to do anything.  You want to run your private node? Go ahead! Do it.
@_date: 2016-09-12 16:25:43


I think you completely misread the post if you are making this argument. OPs post makes clear that the node and the CPU/Storage and bandwidth in use today are **not going to cause any more decentralization** if scaled up.
Thats *all* that the story said.  Why you got your panties in a knot and start to attack it with so much text is beyond me.
@_date: 2016-09-22 13:19:45


You should back up your accusation with something.
@_date: 2015-11-16 09:17:20


Running a node is done out of selfish reasons, not altruism. If you can't come up with any good reasons, let me help you. But really you should re-think the idea that if you can't come up with a reason, than that means there is none...
People run a node because they want to have validated transactions and history. They can point their SPV wallet to their own node running at home.
A small community (think; church, school etc) can run a node to make everyone able to point their SPV wallet to, so a single individual in their own community is the only one that has to be trusted in payment traffic.
Same goes for companies doing payslip management or any other regular payouts.

It is different because BIP101 has a limit that is meant to avoid too big blocks that the network can't handle.


BIP101 is not limitless. It certainly has limits. So the premise in your question fails.
There has been a LOT of progress in the software, many different bugs and mistakes in the code have been fixed and now the system can handle many more transactions than it could 5 years ago. There is technically much less need for a block limit today than there was years ago.

I've been working in various committees and similar places which is really the meat of what companies call "Change-management".
The change-management is called in when, for instance, you want people to change from perforce to git followed by a change in working that is allowed by the new tool.
The most difficult places is where people end up identifying with the solution that is supposed to be replaced.  "this is the perforce expert" is really the worst thing you can hear when you end up coaxing this team. Because you know he will feel like its a personal affront to change to something (anything) new.


When I read this sentence I immediately thought about this experience I had where some internal (bug-managing) system was replaced with an off-the-shelf one. And the designer and maintainer was saying all these things too.
It didn't take a genius to find out that asking for more drafts, more tests and more simulations was really not about the new solution. If only demonstrated by the fact that this guy asked for more simulations, but refused to actually jump in and do those simulations in a collaborative way.
In change management, the argument you bring to the table is useless on its own.  It makes everyone suspect that the person bringing that onto the table is actively fighting the change. Nothing more.
In the end the change *will* happen. Rejection was never an option. And this reality always sets in and then the true colours of the guy will show. Will he embrace it? Or will he forever hold a grudge?
