If you never withdraw money from your "wallet" on the exchange, and especially if you mainly trade with other people on the exchange, then when you go to buy bitcoin, what's to stop the exchange from pocketing the coin and falsely incrementing what the website says your balance is?  Hell, they could do fractional reserve in this manner and no one (normies - the technically savvy could look at ledger records and see something amiss) would be the wiser until there's a run on the exchange.

Assuming much of 2016's growth was organic rather than based purely on hyper-speculation, I think it represents a 'floor' below which BTC is unlikely to go - around $600.  If the previous crash is any indication, then we're likely to stay above that floor, so I figure $1000-$1200 or so is where it will stabilize before slowly riding up again to the next rollercoaster.

The exact same thing happens with gold, in fact.  Rather than buying physical gold, people buy "certificates" of ownership or similar.  But there's no guarantee that there's actually gold behind it.  You can buy and sell these certificates and even make a profit, but if too many people requested physical gold for their certs, the system would collapse.

You can if people's wallets are all on the exchange and few people try withdrawing :o

Yes - like I said, technical users could tell.

This bill has bipartisan support from both Democrats and Republicans who have been office far longer than Trump was anything other than a reality tv host.

I wonder how many of these people have experience with traditional investing?  Like my retirement fund goes down all the time, sometimes for entire consecutive quarters (2008 lmao), but over the course of several years it grows.
