I completely agree. Bitcoin is the most popular coin because it's been around the longest which means that more people are aware of it. Nowadays you have inexperienced investors buying up as much bitcoin as they are willing to risk because they see that the price has rocketed. This kind of excessive buying is facilitated by the fact the people have had bitcoin in the corner of their minds for so long. Once mass adoption and public knowledge increases for more technologically advanced coins, bitcoin will be left in the dust. Just my opinion.

Could you elaborate a little? What knowledge of scaling block chains are you referring to (a link would be suffice). I'm just curious to hear why you have such faith in Bitcoin's superior scalability when there seem to be more versatile altcoins. 
(Just looking for an opinion :). Not looking to step on any toes)

Actually I would argue that the emergence of so many different altcoins is what is going to cause the eventual fall of bitcoin. Zcash, in particular, is being utilized to enhance Etheruem much more than Bitcoin. There's currently a large project with Zcash, ethereum, and JPMorgan at the moment which is focused on implementing the Zk Snarks tech into the ethereum chain for fast and private transaction records. This and instances like it show that the cryptocurrency industry is starting to move away (if they havent already) from the bitcoin fan favorite. This is just my opinion and I am open to critcism.
