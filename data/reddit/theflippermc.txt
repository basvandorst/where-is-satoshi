It'd be easy for me to remember, not sure about most people though. I currently remember a 50 character password for my laptop and a 32 character password for my password manager :P

No, proper brainwallets are used as the most secure type of cold storage.
A brainwallet with 24 words chosen with diceware, and maybe a randomly generated password on the end is the most secure cold storage possible.
My bitcoins are kept in a brainwallet with 24 words and a 24 character password on the end. That's more secure than paper wallets and most other kinds of cold storage, even if they use BIP38. Most people probably don't use a particularly strong password for the BIP encryption, so in theory someone could quite easily crack it, and very quickly if they have a botnet or something.

Yes, but once you've sent it somewhere else they don't care.
Example: if you send bitcoins to one of the many silk road-like markets around today directly from Coinbase, your account is shut. You send it to another wallet first, then there, they don't do anything. They monitor your first transaction, and take action depending on what that is - NOT the second.

Opening this in one tab then looking at  in another is oddly entertaining.
@_date: 2015-08-09 15:48:27
Yep. Took me a long time to remember them though, and a lot of just looking at a written copy when entering them.

Is it on one of the pages in the sidebar? Probably can't tell me but I really want that money...
@_date: 2015-08-15 20:59:25
What do you mean, *over*?
@_date: 2015-08-09 02:33:35
I did the same on Archive.org, and I can confirm that did not make a mistake - there have been no changes.
@_date: 2015-08-09 01:41:17
Did you add the phrase for this or was it already on there?
@_date: 2015-07-28 19:17:10
Didn't realize you could purchase bitcoins through Mycelium, I'll look into it, thanks :)
@_date: 2015-07-28 19:47:58
It's got 24 random words and a 24-character long, randomly generated password at the end. It's pretty secure, but thanks

I didn't say they didn't. I said they don't care what you do after the second transaction. There's been numerous reports of them taking action against an account when someone sends their bitcoins directly from Coinbase to a tor market, but not a single one where someones sent it to another wallet, then to a tor market.
Yes it's not a safe way to do it as it leaves an easy trail for police to follow, but whether or not Coinbase monitors that trail, it will still be followed by the police regardless.
What I'm trying to say is it doesn't matter if Coinbase monitors you past the first transaction, because if you're doing something that they'll shut your account down for, it won't matter for the police whether they monitor it or not.

Don't use Hive on your android phone. Lots of people have reported their wallet being wiped when they exit the app, and the recovery phrase not working.
@_date: 2015-07-28 21:40:21
Lol, we've all been there. Thanks for this :)
@_date: 2015-07-28 19:21:52
I thought the same about localbitcoins, don't feel like meeting up with a stranger.
And thanks for the ATM map, there's one fairly close to me, might be able to convince my parents to go if I have the cash and we're in the area.
@_date: 2015-07-28 20:01:11
I see it, thank you :-)
@_date: 2015-07-28 19:20:33
Link isn't loading for me, I'll try it later. Thanks
@_date: 2015-07-28 19:32:14
Thanks for the advice :)
@_date: 2015-07-28 21:24:13
I get my allowance in my bank, and I usually end up spending it fast. Getting it in bitcoin actually sounds like a pretty neat idea.
And thanks so much :) Promise I'm not a scammer :P
@_date: 2015-07-28 19:28:49
How exactly would those work? Does the person have to be with the same bank?
@_date: 2015-07-28 21:42:33
Hmm, think I might do that. Thanks for telling me 
@_date: 2015-07-28 19:18:13
I'm using a brainwallet with a randomly generated password at the end, and I think I'm going to stick with that. The address is 1Kr3y7yhu4CNstWRg68pWWTQqxZYj7xT4g
@_date: 2015-07-28 21:38:54


I got it, thank you :)
@_date: 2015-07-28 22:45:43
Thanks :)
@_date: 2015-07-28 23:48:12
Thanks for the bitcoins, and yes I absolutely am :)
@_date: 2015-07-28 19:20:05
Thank you so much &lt;3
@_date: 2015-07-28 20:49:36
Thank you, and I promise ;)
@_date: 2015-07-28 21:00:05
I'm actually in France right now (holiday), but I will definitely try to go to one of those! Looks cool
@_date: 2015-07-28 20:12:00
YES! Thanks so much, I didn't expect anyone to give me BTC &lt;3
@_date: 2015-07-28 19:20:15
Thanks :D
@_date: 2015-07-28 20:22:46
New to bitcoins, got some tips from some people today, would love some more :P Thanks for doing this!
@_date: 2015-07-28 21:41:15
Thank you :D
@_date: 2015-07-28 19:37:54
So close :P
