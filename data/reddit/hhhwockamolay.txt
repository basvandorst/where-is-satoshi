Buy ASAP 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:13:35
Yeah but the fees are more. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:10:47
Should’ve got in earlier 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:28:06
Buy now 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:42:07
Nobody knows. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:48:57
It’s not gonna happen immediately. It’s just another big push that’s getting people closer to buying. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:31:05
Oh no 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:10:10
If you bought through Coinbase, the price is locked in where you bought it. In 7 days you’ll have profit or deficit 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:23:53
Welcome to the fucking show 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:19:01
Should’ve used a different service then. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:46:48
It dropped like a rock for like 10 minutes then came back 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:13:20
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:10:00
There’s no guarantee it comes back up anytime soon if it drops. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:03:47
I mean nobody *really* knows what’s gonna happen. Most people on this sub are leaning towards believing Bitcoin will be a long term success, but nobody really knows.
If I were you I would deposit 50-100 a week to alleviate risk.

This is how banks work 
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:46:07
Edit: playing games like this seems like a decent idea when you see bitcoin going up semi consistently. But it ust takes one big correction or drop and you have lifelong financial problems. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:06:23
Sounds like you know what you want to do 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:17:41
Should’ve used a different service or bought in earlier. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:37:47
It would crash 
@_date: 2017-11-20 06:15:41
2017 is a part of it. If you want to know exactly where 2017 starts on the graph go on Google trends on Desktop. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:17:29
What’s the context? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:01:07
I’d wait til 100k but that’s me. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:35:46
It’s either going to hit 20k by like January 15th or crash. There’s no in between. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:21:16
Why would you not invest something like $50? You don’t have to invest thousands right away for it to be effective. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:26:51
Coinbase 
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:29:15
Buy buy buy 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:34:34
Buy before it hits 20k bro
