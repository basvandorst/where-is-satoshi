Yes, I do see it as being acceptable as a primary source of income for the average person because Bitcoins can be converted to a number of fiat currencies and deposited into a bank account via the Bitcoin exchanges, or sold for cash via local Bitcoin dealers.
The real challenge is finding enough consistent good paying work for Bitcoin for a primary income. Admittedly, that that may not be too easy in the current landscape.

Matthew had initially limited the bet total to 10,000 BTC, but then, after that limit was reached, he allowed people who had already placed bets to increase their bet significantly.

Looks like "let 'em burn" is in full effect when it comes to people addicted to gambling. They can load up on Lotto tickets or play slot machines all day long at an Indian casino. But I guess this is 'socially responsible' gambling because the government gets a cut, right?

Put your money in unaudited and uninsured accounts anywhere and see what happens. I'm continually shocked at how much money people are putting into these Bitcoin 'exchanges' that have no insurance, no accounting audits and no security audits. And this is especially shocking since so many other people have already been burned. There is a sucker born every minute....

At its core Bitcoin is simply a protocol. It is a protocol like TCP/IP is a protocol. If someone told you that TCP/IP was not 'practical for the average user', you would probably be confused because the average user doesn't need to know anything about TCP/IP. They just open up their web browser. 
To believe that Bitcoin will never be practical for the average user is to believe that it is impossible to build up the infrastructure around the Bitcoin protocol to make it practical for the average user to use. This to me is quite a bold claim.
Since Bitcoin is a protocol, it is open to every developer on the planet to develop something for. There are 0 restrictions on the usage of the Bitcoin protocol in software, and no single entity controls it. That alone makes me believe that the statement that 'Bitcoin will never be practical for the average user' has a low probability of being true. Making Bitcoin usable for the average person is not just a software problem, since it will have to bootstrap off of existing banking and payment systems, but every entrepreneur on the planet can try to solve those problems as well, with no restrictions on the use of Bitcoin itself. If I'm an entrepreneur and I want to use PayPal, I have to abide by an agreement with a lot of restrictions, give them a rake of every transaction and be worried that PayPal will want to do what I'm doing and put me out of business. Not so with Bitcoin, which is simply a protocol. It's for these reasons there are already a large number of Bitcoin startups trying to solve these problems for the average user.

Bitcoin has a lot more growing up to do in terms of the infrastructure around it, but the amount of development that has occurred with this relatively niche currency since it was launched in 2009 has been nothing short of incredible. Yes, there are still a lot of gaps in terms of being able to buy/sell BTC in a lot of countries, but it will only get better over time (short of regulatory problems). 
I don't think anyone here is suggesting that you switch your entire business to using BTC. But switching to BTC on the margin and finding the situations where it works well now (this seems to be what you are doing) is a good way to go. You should consider it a hedge against the risk of your PayPal account being frozen. My claim is that Bitcoin's properties make it inherently superior to PayPal or any of the mainstream payment/banking systems, regardless of the current difficulties and problems with using it. 
One way anyone can get BTC without going through any bank, exchange or local dealer is to simply work for it! Or you can sell stuff online for it.

I think the key difference here is that you can keep most of your BTC in cold storage and have a small amount of BTC in a cloud based wallet like coinbase for convenient, instantaneous transactions. I also suspect that coinbase would lose to competitors quickly if they became as bad as PayPal since people could rapidly move their coins to another service.

MtGox is not the only way to acquire BTC. There is no fixed fee for acquiring BTC, because there are many ways to acquire it outside of exchanges. In any event, you are comparing apples and oranges in my opinion. As it was explained above, PayPal is not a 'cash' medium of exchange because of charge backs and account closures/freezes. I cannot work for anyone in the world for PayPal without worrying about those risks. This is not true for Bitcoin. Once anyone sends it to me, it's better than cash in the bank.
You are comparing your situation which is working with trusted individuals that you are fairly certain will not trigger a chargeback or account freeze on your PayPal account to a completely different situation that was described in the article, which is working for **anyone** in the world. In that case, the risk is the person not sending you your BTC for your work, but PayPal or any payment system will have that risk as well.

Oh **hell** no. As optimistic as I am about Bitcoin, I don't think it is ready for the Super Bowl demographic. They will go to bitcoin.org, download the client, watch it sit for about 10 minutes doing 'nothing' and then uninstall it.

And what politician would want to be the one *responsible* for the banks losing billions? None of course. They would actually be better off letting Bitcoin be the scapegoat.
BTW, one part of the equation we are missing here are the developers. Bitcoin is a protocol that can be baked directly into any app, no questions asked. There is no way the government would release a digital currency backed by fiat that had no red tape. It would be regulated to hell and would probably be hell to implement into an app. I talked to some developers who looked at the APIs for MintChip. They said it was terrible. On the development side of things you can't beat 0 regulation.

Unfortunately, mtgox is the only way to go for that kind of volume. You can sell the coins pretty much right away, but you have to wait to get verified to get the USD out.
1. Create an account at mtgox.com
2. Set up 2 factor authentication on mtgox: 
3. Transfer bitcoins into mtgox (should take about an hour)
4. Sell coins on mtgox
5. Put name and address info and upload documents to start verification process on mtgox
6. Once you are verified on mtgox, set up bank wire transfer to get USD funds out

The problem with your analogy is that the appeal of Bitcoin is that it is not controlled by a single entity, let alone a corporate entity. The worst that could happen if your word processor software company fails is you can't get support until you install a new word processor from another competing company.
If the company/entity that controls your money fails, you are potentially going to be living on the streets. Or even if the company doesn't fail, you have given up control of your money to a single corporate entity that can manipulate it. That's why there is major suspicion of Ripple: people don't like the fact that a huge number of the XRPs are controlled by a single company.
As for governments, people trust government issued currency because governments can persist indefinitely through their power to tax everything. This is not to say that they *will* persist indefinitely, because they can certainly fail if they screw up, but the perception is there that the government can't/won't go out of business.
There could be proprietary competition with Bitcoin, but it would have to be a company that completely open sourced their currency and did not premine it and control it. Although, if they don't control the currency, they have to come up with some other business model. I'm not sure what that business model would be.

Sounds like a generic response to me. I bet he says that to almost every suggestion that comes into his email box. Heck, he probably has an assistant to sort through spam and other B.S. and reply with generic responses. Shuttleworth is probably way too busy to even think about Bitcoin. Maybe you should email some other guys at Canonical who actually have time to review the suggestion.

A government might be able to release a competing digital currency that was backed by their existing fiat currency, this is true. I believe Canada tried to do this with MintChip. However, there is a big problem with them doing this. In fact, there are 2 competing outcomes, neither of which makes sense:
*1 The government makes the digital currency so it is on par (or even better) with cryptocurrencies in terms of ease of transfer and low fees. As part of this, of course, the government allows you to store your digital currency on storage media such as USB sticks, mobile phones etc.*
In this case, the government would be throwing the banks and other financial institutions under the bus. The institutions of the legacy banking system would literally stand to lose billions, if not trillions on all the fees they collect on the inefficiencies of the fiat banking system. This includes ATM fees, overdraft fees, debit card fees, money order fees etc. For instance, if I can safely and securely store all my money on my mobile phone, USB stick and or hard drive and be able to transmit that to anyone in an instant, why would I have a checking account at a bank? If no one had to have a checking account, everyone would pull their money out of the banks and the banks would collapse.
*2 The government creates a digital currency but ties it down with all kinds of fees, limits and complexities.*
In this case, the government might be able to *improve* on the existing legacy banking system, but in general the system is still going to suck and be very expensive for consumers and businesses. This of course means that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin will continue to grow and thrive because they sidestep all of the rules that the government would impose on its digital currency.
TLDR: The government would be throwing its cronies in the legacy banking system under the bus if it released a digital currency that significantly improved upon the legacy banking system.

I don't think the problem is getting money in. The problem is getting it out. If you want to transfer out more than the paltry amounts at level 0 verification, you have to get into the 'verified' AML queue, which is backed up by thousands of accounts. Then, when you add a withdrawal method, it has to be verified, that takes a couple weeks as well.
