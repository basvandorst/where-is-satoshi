I believe silver's going to bring the greatest return to those who buy it while its low.
People have been hoarding gold in vaults forever, while we treat silver like as an industrial metal (as it's the 2nd most used commodity in the world next to oil) and use it in tons of products which eventually get thrown in the trash, leaving silver being way more scarce than we're lead to believe.
Some people even believe that there's less above ground silver than there is above ground gold. If that's the case, then silver investors are going to see a huge return.
I bet all you bitcoiners are going to downvote the hell out of this.

I really hope this is a joke

Have you been to the shibecoin website?

Dogecoins done all this in its 8 month lifespan while Bitcoin's been around since 2009. Where was bitcoin 8 months after it had been created?
Just cause somebody posted an article about dumping all his doge for bitcoin doesn't really mean anything to me. Hell, if I was going to dump all my Doge Id rather sell em for something like XCurrency way before I'd consider Bitcoin.

You're the only one who said anything about Doge overtaking bitcoin.
And the fact that 90% of the coins have been mined shows that Doge has become popular as fuck in a ridiculously short amount of time. Pretty important stuff when you're talking about currencies becoming accepted by the public.

I swear you bitcoiners sound like the most butthurt, bitter group of people I've ever talked to.
I don't get it. A lot of people who are into bitcoin talk about how its gonna change the world and take down the powers that be, while at the same time, the algorithm its based on was created by the NSA.
At the end of the day, bitcoin and Dogecoin are pretty much the same thing. One just has faster transaction times, better marketing, a friendlier community, a hashing algorithm that wasn't created by the NSA, and a Nascar.

So how ya been?

Gold can't go to zero.

What was bitcoin worth 7 months after it was created?

So it wouldn't bother you if you sold something to somebody and had to wait a few hours to receive payment when you could have sold the same thing to somebody whos payment you could receive instantly?

Doge has way faster transaction times than bitcoin. That being said, I don't really see how you could say it's a joke.
It's also become so popular with in its 8 month lifespan that 90% of all the coins have been mined, while Bitcoin has only become popular enough to have had about 62% of the coins mined since 2009.
As far as Im concerned, if bitcoiners make fun of Dogecoin, youre pretty much making fun of yourself.

You realize that if you had bought Doge when I said was the time to buy, you would have made a pretty sweet return, yes?
If you had bought bitcoin, you'd be looking at a loss.

Cause I bring logic to the table?
@_date: 2014-07-29 13:47:00
I havn't seen all of these videos but the 2nd one you posted is full of flaws. Don't get me wrong, I love cryptos but there is a lot of misinfo in that video.
@_date: 2014-07-29 14:19:12
I think yall are forgetting the fact that Dogecoin is only 7 months old. Where was bitcoin at after 7 months of its creation? 
@_date: 2014-06-05 15:35:11
Silvers gonna dominate PMs
@_date: 2014-08-14 17:50:29
Doesn't mean shit... Bitcoin flash crashed to $.01 before it peaked. 
Nows the time to buy.
@_date: 2014-02-26 05:15:32
How did you reach that conclusion?
@_date: 2014-09-28 14:25:45
I bet you wish you had bought some Doge when I said it was a good time to buy.
