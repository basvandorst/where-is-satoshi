Thanks for your input. :)

Yes, that is exactly what I'm saying. I'm saying that if the trend continues (**IF!**), we could likely see stupid high numbers for bitcoin tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:12:46
Yup, it totally was lol. I feel silly now hahaha.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:53:41
Actually, I'm looking at this trend continuing over the next 24 hours. I agree, when the cme starts bitcoin futures trading, we are likely to see a big drop. But they won't start for a few days.
I'm not saying that we are definitely going that high. Just that it's the next target if the trend continues and volume picks up again
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:13:02
If the trend continues and the volume keeps up, sometime within the next 24 hours.

I noticed a pattern on bitcoin over the past few days. I have no idea if the trend will continue, and it could pop at any time.
That being said, it made a 2.618 fibonacci move the last two cycles. The next 2.618 fib projection would be at about 35 million korean ~~Wan~~ Won (lol sorry for typo), or about $32,000 USD. I do not anticipate it will sustain these highs permanently, and I'm sure the snap back will be very hard when it happens.
Hate on me for technical analysis all you want, but this is just the pattern that I'm seeing. :)

Uhh... that doesn't make sense. But okay.
I'm not dogging bitcoin. Its likely to do amazingly well. Bitcoin has advantages that precious metals do not, particularly in the area of electronic transfer.
But, do you really think that the history of the monetary use of precious metals is invalid... because blockchain? Lol. Get real bud. Not to mention of course the industrial use of both gold and silver.
Edit: Besides... why would I be interested in the price 5000 years later? lol. I'm interested in the price tomorrow and for the foreseeable future within my lifetime.
@_date: 2017-02-17 12:40:10


Yes, I agree with this. There are a great many things about the financial system that should not be the way they are and certainly create the capacity for abuse of the system. That in itself doesn't mean that the system **will** undeniably die.


Maybe. I might even say probably. But, can you substantiate that with proof? Just how much are you willing to risk to assume that's true? How far of a leap of faith are you willing to make? Are you making that leap of faith blindly? Based on speculation? Or based on hard data and facts?
Your paradigm of how the world should work is not necessarily what will happen within your lifetime.
Be wise. Hedge accordingly.

They charge the merchant fees.
If you're buying from Coinbase for example, they would be the merchant and be charged the fee by the credit card company.
The merchant will typically pass the cost of that fee onto you, which is why there's a large fee on Coinbase if you purchase with a credit card than a bank transfer (I think its 3.99% if I recall correctly?)

Ahh, CNBC and their gold hating rhetoric. Looks like they might be lightening up slightly on Bitcoin though. That's interesting for sure.
@_date: 2017-02-23 21:06:59
I don't look at it so black and white.
There are components of centralization, and there always will be. Those components of centralization MUST serve a utility to the market in some way or another - and if they don't maintain that utility and don't protect the value that they hold properly, they're eventually doomed to fail.
However, it seems to me that bitcoin, at its core, will always be decentralized.
Of course, I could be mistaken.
And I'd never want to see a 'board of directors' of bitcoin, or any other central group of decision makers. If that ever happened, I wouldn't take bitcoin seriously anymore and would just view it like any other financial asset. And I'd probably look for a new place to store my value.
95% consensus may be slow, yes. But its deliberate and fair.

I love this list. Did you make it?
I absolutely LOVE bitcoin, but I think its foolish not to evaluate it exclusively in terms of its strengths -- its important to also consider its weaknesses.
@_date: 2017-02-17 16:20:32
Yes, definitely. At this stage in the game, I already have enough phyzz. I'm going almost 100% bitcoin with my capital because of that.
If I was new to the game at this point, I'd probably skip gold and go 70% bitcoin and 30% silver. But that's just me :)
@_date: 2017-02-24 22:26:16
You're a rock star, thank you so much!
@_date: 2017-02-24 19:10:16
Still not confirmed, but funds also aren't in the wallet. Keep waiting?
Thanks again :D
@_date: 2017-02-17 15:30:36
This guy gets it ^^
I agree that the transition is likely to occur eventually.
But also believe that it will probably happen very gradually, if it declines at all. Edit: And I tend to believe that precious metals are very highly undervalued already. I don't anticipate that will persist indefinitely, and I believe that the free market will eventually revalue its price far higher than we presently see it in dollar terms today.
But definitely... once cryptocurrency is generally accepted worldwide, I agree that its probably going to take some 'market share' from precious metals. Some. Probably not all.
Crypto and bitcoin is a much bigger threat to *cash* than it is to precious metals.

I recently started following Clif High. To be sure, he's made some interesting predictions, and some of them have come true. My favorite one recently has been [Atmospheric Rivers](
About bitcoin specifically, I went back to verify that bitcoin had bounced between 400-428 3 times as he stated it would (verifying this after the 'prediction' had been made and fulfilled -- so in retrospect I don't know with 100% certainty that the prediction was made *before* the price action), and I personally observed 888 USD all over the exchanges. Also personally observed 1088 as a significant number too.
Could be confirmation bias. I suppose time will tell.
If it hits 1488 by the end of March like he's talking about, I'll definitely be paying keen attention to him.
His ALTA reports are available at halfpasthuman.com for a measly $15. Some of the most interesting reading.
I'm not saying I believe everything in it as gospel necessarily, but I'm paying attention to see if his track record is still as good as ~~everyone~~ some people are saying it is.
I still haven't decided whether i think he's a total quack or a genius. I think he's either AMAZINGLY good at bullshitting, or he very well could be the real McCoy. That's just my thoughts though.
Very clever guy, definitely.
Here's another one he just did with Sarah Westall:

Your points are well stated.
I find it necessary again to point out that I never said that gold was superior (or even that bitcoin was superior). I still maintain that they are (and likely will continue to be for at least some time) complementary assets more than they are competing assets.
If you think that bitcoin is superior... well, that's fine. I don't have the desire to convince you otherwise or to disprove you (in fact, I probably couldn't since many of the points you present are not falsifiable and instead are well thought out speculation). Much of what you stated must be borne out over time -- which again was part of the point that I made.
(As an aside, I like silver a hell of a lot more than I like gold. I think it has far greater real world industrial demand and necessity than gold does, the gold to silver ratio is very heavily skewed toward undervaluing silver, and there are no large stockpiles of silver in the world like there is of gold.)
On the other hand, if your musings are simply an explanation of the facts and your interpretation of them, then on the whole I agree with you, and it was a pleasure to read them :)
@_date: 2017-02-17 19:53:30
I can assure you that I understand the mechanism.
And in general I agree with you, in concept, that "bitcoin offers literally everything gold offers as an asset plus more".
You seem to be misinterpreting my statement, so let me clarify :)
Bitcoin is in its infancy still. Its biggest threats are government regulation (stifling its growth, but probably not outright killing it) and competing cryptocurrencies (none on the horizon at the moment that really pose a threat, but that could change).
I'm simply stating that gold (and silver!!!) are proven stores of value.
I don't wish to disprove your claim :) I actually agree with it by and large. 
@_date: 2017-02-25 03:07:06
This I could almost see as really happening.
@_date: 2017-02-24 02:12:52
Thanks ��
About 3 days... So if nothing is confirmed by Saturday, check the balance of the sending address, and if the balance is unchanged from the original transaction attempts, then resend with a larger fee - right?
@_date: 2017-02-17 12:44:17
Except you're not taking into consideration that gold has at least a 5,000 year history of operating as money and as a store of value.
Bitcoin *may* be a store of value. But it needs to prove itself.
Bitcoin is still in its infancy when you compare it with gold's history.
Bitcoin and gold are *not* competitors. They are complementary assets. Its better to hold both than it is to hold one - but either are certainly way better than cash.
I like silver a lot, too.

The markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.

@_date: 2017-03-01 12:43:44
Just wait on silver. The real fireworks are coming later ;-)
I'm a big fan of both bitcoin and silver. I'm very excited to see which one performs better.
Being intimately familiar with both bitcoin and silver and the factors that contribute to their fundamental value, I can truly say its anyone's guess as to which one will outperform the other. But I think both will do astonishingly well :)
@_date: 2017-03-03 12:55:26
This comment above matches my sentiment.
Taking profits? I wouldn't do that unless it was into another store of value. Gold, Silver, or perhaps another crypto I like.
If you take profits and the dollar (or your local currency) dumps in value, then you're throwing your money away.
Lets not forget that all fiat currencies eventually reach the true value.
I'm all for taking profits, but why put it into the dollar, euro, yen, yuan, etc? 
@_date: 2017-02-11 13:41:14

His speech reflects only a surface level knowledge of bitcoin, but betrays a lack of understanding at the core level.
I'm optimistic he'll be willing to admit defeat and jump on board eventually. He seems like an honest guy.

From what I hear, matching sequential numbers is considered good luck in China, and its kind of a big deal.
If you look back and see the peak on January 4th on OKCoin, it was 8888.
Quoting from here: 




If China starts leading the market, these would definitely be numbers to watch, both in Yuan, as well as their dollar/euro conversion counterpart (or whatever your local currency is).

Transferring my bitcoin off of coinbase to my own paper wallet. I'm done seeing these posts.
@_date: 2017-01-31 15:33:33
YES! The entire interface is quite clunky and can make trading a little confusing sometimes. More than once have I created an order that executed (or did not execute) in a manner contrary to how I planned.
I understand how to trade. I understand the orders. I just think Kraken's interface needs some work.
That being said... I'm just glad you guys did an audit of your bitcoin a few years ago. I'd love to see a yearly (or even monthly) audit as well.

I like to transfer USD to coinbase, and then to GDAX and just use a limit or market order. 
Market order on GDAX - 0 fee
Limit order on GDAX - .25%
Bitcoin purchase with bank transfer on Coinbase - 1.99%
Bitcoin purchase with credit/debit on Coinbase - 3.99%
