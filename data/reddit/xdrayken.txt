Bitcoin as a currency won't mean much unless it finds a way to be the bridge between the other projects using their own currency to fuel their technology, there's a reason why a bunch of people jumped ship at 15-20k when they figured out there were too many idiots pouring in (check 24h volume trends and media spread), and instead started investing in Alts that had strong projects backing them.  
  
The thing with bitcoin is that it's essentially the blockchain technology's prototype - it's nothing but a currency which can only find use if it's given the opportunity to be used by companies etc - the real deal lies within projects that utilize blockchain technology for more than just a currency, things like transactions that carry information, like API requests, 3D rendering etc - using the blockchain like a supercomputer that processes information for countless people all at once.  
  
Bitcoin is great, most definitely not a scam, right now we're just seeing a correction but the major sell-off by morons is definitely not helping - BTC is still in a very good state considering that at this point, it's still at a 1100% increase over the last year - but bitcoin's use is limited since it relies on others to be used, rather than itself.

The idiots came in around Nov 27, now they're shitting themselves, we're currently directly on the projected line even with this "crash" - even if it goes down to $7k we'll still be right along the upwards line that started early 2017.  
  
People seem to be forgetting that BTC barely was at 900$ at the start of last year - they'd rather just be pointing out that it's crashing from the 20k that was created by the morons who came in late in the year, surprised that the price is correcting back to its original projection.

That's not meaningless, it's an explanation of what the guy above you meant which you clearly didn't get.  
  
And the reason why this is happening is because the market is silent after a shitty event, people tend to become paranoid when they have to wait during those scenarios. The market should correct itself when China comes clean with their intentions.

Chill the fuck out, you're complaining about someone making a joke concerning the state of bitcoin and the reaction of users who know what they're doing towards it.

There are more sell offers than buy offers, which means people constantly undercutting eachother to sell off their BTC, which means the price drops.

Same amount of time for everyone I know. Not sure what's going wrong in your case.

You have an impressive form of mental retardation, it's quite obvious you're trying to act like you're on a high horse for no fucking reason to hide the fact that you're insanely mentally challenged. All this over a fucking joke picture about Bitcoin and its price dip, pathetic. Feels like you're a very insecure little person using the internet as a tool to feel better about yourself by blowing things out of proportion, in order to make yourself feel like the narcissistic tool you've always wanted to be.

As said, person in question is a "BTC n00b" so he probably has no idea how any of that is done.

Coinbase and Bittrex took me about five to ten minutes for full verification.
