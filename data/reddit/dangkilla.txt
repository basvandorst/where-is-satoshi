I have an acquaintance stupidly investing in Off-market penny stocks via OTC pink slips. Yes, like in Wolf of Wall Street. That stock will sky rocket from 2 cents, any day now

Can confirm.

The average person doesn't know the difference, so yeah, I don't see how brigading BCH  is going to help.

Good info. Thanks.

Can you explain the security issues with NFC? I imagine it's RF, so someone can steal your Bitcoin over-the-air? I'm clueless, so just curious if you know.

Tether your fiat to BTC!

We need to get above $520B probably to hit $12K for BTC, so there is still time to make money hodling and buying on the dips.

QR is good for 2nd and 3rd world countries at least.

He took the weekend off during the hack of summer of 2011 - while his employees and people who flew around the world were working? I'd say he was inept. He sounds like a schlub who just wanted a big paycheck for doing the bare minimum.
[Here's a library]( from his github repo.

I think he would have ran if he really planned it out.

Do you mean Coinbase.com or is this a technical term?

Don't spend it all in one place, young shibe

Interesting tidbit - they had deleted all their tweets as far back as January 7th. Now all of their tweets are gone.

They practically give OS X away now anyways. OSX's BSD kernel is stable and awesome. I love it.
@_date: 2014-02-22 20:13:56
Okay, thank you.

It looks like the documents were confirmed as genuine. 
It's sad that Mt. Gox was so poorly run. It seems like Mark didn't care for business much.

And the TradeHill links is now dead, as I read this thread 5 months later.

Twitter and Facebook are just tools. Apparently you don't need them, but they can be handy.
Anyhow, thanks for the post!

I've been in IT since '96, and it still took me a while to understand the basics.
@_date: 2014-02-22 19:58:36
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:15:55
They've also deleted all of their tweets.

Sometimes you can invest in yourself. Sometimes you might want to invest in others. My favorite charity is The Sheltering Arms Atlanta if anybody hasnt setup a charity on  yet. Help an underprivileged child get a good education and day care for parents who work two jobs

Thanks for the correction

99.99% would be 8 hours of downtime. Five decimals is the industry standard so it is 99.99222% uptime, about 40 minutes which still seems kind of high.

Ha, I saw Dido shooting that video in front of Mann's Chinese theatre...

Well, that area used to be shady back then, so you never know...
