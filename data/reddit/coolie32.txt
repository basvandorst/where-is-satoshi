Want to sell them to me?
@_date: 2018-06-20 16:25:01
Seriously though...Where have you been. You can definitely tell who reads up and who listens up with bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-20 18:22:04
Spend 5 min researching Bitcoin...You'll find a few. I'm not going to run down each lie and why it's a lie...That takes the fun out of the research that needs to be done.
@_date: 2018-06-20 18:23:24
Ps "I know it's going to crash"...Is a lie! No one can know that....Happy reading!

I'm an MSB, Coinbase banned me last November. I'll try kucoin. 
@_date: 2019-08-30 19:40:45
So what are you doing on message board with college and high school kids old man!? Reddit and r/bitcoin specifically, is the largest Bitcoin forum in the world. Nothing even comes close! But I guess you wouldn't know this seeing as your Reddit account is 2 days old! I understand your comment more now...
@_date: 2018-06-20 16:04:51
@_date: 2019-08-30 18:30:25
Why? This is a Bitcoin form with millions of eyes on it. Seems perfect if i'm looking for people who know other people with Bitcoin. I've got 4 emails already from people who know someone with that much coin. Its a little bit more work but whatever. Life is a grind. Grind towards wealth!

The license I have with FinCEN costs $6.9 million in its self and can be found on the FinCEN. gov website!! But hey thanks for trolling on something you know nothing about! Super clever and helpful!
@_date: 2018-06-20 16:19:53
Well put! Just trying to bring a little awareness. You cant ever just read 1 article about a subject with Bitcoin or Crypto. Have to read 5 or 6...Then make your own. Everyone just need to stay strong and not give in the the bs that is being put out there.
@_date: 2019-08-30 18:43:56
Lmao Goons hahaha Why do people even post when they are just talking trash and look stupid! Is this how to got your jollys today...Someone laughing at you??
@_date: 2018-06-20 15:51:05
You're going to listen to them when they tell you it's going to crash and stay away!?!? No thank you!
@_date: 2019-08-30 18:28:30
Its super legit. You can PM me and I can show you my credentials or whatever is needed. I already have the LOI and POF. My last seller fell off the map apparently. Its a no brainer with those with the coin and 100% backed and secured by a few banks.
@_date: 2019-08-30 20:11:30
Its not for me. Its for an exchange! I have a couple seller below even, just looking for a good deal. The last 2 crypto brokers I used over the last few years I found off a post just like this on Reddit. I have the FinCEN. gov license to sell crypto legally in the US and my main contact at NOBLE (that I found in this channel and used several times) has fallen off the earth or something. Haven't heard from him in a few months.
@_date: 2019-08-30 19:03:59
How is it unbelievable that someone posted a post on the largest Bitcoin forum in the world, that they were looking for Bitcoin!? You answered with a great answer too that was helpful, that I will be looking into. Not sure what was so crazy about the post and its location!? There are billions of dollars in Bitcoin traded everyday. Why not broker some of those deals?? I already have the impossible to get FinCEN license. And already own my own Bitcoin ATM Company for the last few years.
@_date: 2018-06-20 19:47:28
If you want to do it that way go ahead. The beauty of this is everyone does it there own way. 
@_date: 2018-06-20 16:21:43
Lol ok guy
@_date: 2019-08-30 18:11:59
They sell it for scratch thought. I've found well below even from some sellers, but in this bear market its harder to get lower numbers.
@_date: 2018-06-20 16:28:05
Truth! I mean unfortunately we are in an age of talking before researching what they are even talking about...
@_date: 2019-08-30 20:25:34
I have a FinCEN license to sell and broker crypto deals. I've found my last 2 brokers/sellers even buyers off this channel from a post just like this. Its for an exchange I already have POF and LOI for 120k units from them and they can meet in person at first or whatever needs to happen to start small and build trust to accomplish whats needed.

@_date: 2018-03-24 19:32:09
Give them all to me before natural selection takes you. ��
@_date: 2018-03-27 00:29:39
Go watch the GREED on Silk Road. Good Documentary on him.
@_date: 2018-03-27 05:12:52
Yes. Sorry wasn't clear on that. Great documentary.
@_date: 2018-07-03 05:17:27
And at that many it comes with a - infront of the %
@_date: 2018-07-03 05:27:23
Are there any that work with US customers? 
@_date: 2018-07-03 05:16:36
Do you have over 50,000 units?
@_date: 2018-07-03 07:44:00
Ok will do thanks
@_date: 2018-04-05 02:57:13
@_date: 2018-04-05 03:24:25

@_date: 2018-04-05 05:14:31
Ok, I reached out. Thanks! Appreciate the help!
@_date: 2018-04-08 19:04:42
Youre pretty much retarded! ��
@_date: 2018-04-05 03:21:00
I have personal accounts with millions in them. Looking for a bank that allows my MSB as a business account.
@_date: 2018-04-01 22:11:38
"Correct if I'm wrong" You can't prove that you are right for someone to "Prove you wrong" can you prove yourself right...no! Yes, you are wrong and no one can prove the future.
@_date: 2018-04-09 14:52:37
The internet!
@_date: 2018-04-05 03:31:51
Like I said. I'm well aware of the prince...Hence why I'm reaching out all over the place. I'll find paydirt eventually.
@_date: 2018-04-10 00:02:32
Then the internet would have gone down and the only way that would happen is if all the power in the world would go out and if that's the case we will be back to trading skins and were all in a world of pain.
@_date: 2018-04-12 05:42:33
Been there for about a year now actually. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 17:07:38
Buy now!
@_date: 2018-04-05 02:46:46
I'm an MSB, they won't let me be a customer because of that. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 19:49:03
I can't send a pic, but my security program tells me this app has had hundred of user complaints that their devices got hacked during the time they were using it. My system security wont even let me keep it after downloading.
@_date: 2018-04-15 15:02:35
Coinpot is a trojan that opens a portal to your phone that allow people to hack into your phone fyi. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 16:19:22
Yes I got the Gucci mens G and paid Bitcoin and the process was super easy. Good work guys!
@_date: 2018-04-05 05:29:19
And I get nothing but "there nothing we can do" from them. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 19:06:37
It's a vary useful app, go troll somewhere else!
@_date: 2018-04-09 14:59:16
Then download blockchain.info app. No info needed but an email.
@_date: 2018-04-05 16:58:39
Thank you. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 15:00:56
Forsure. We gotta keep Bitcoin present! Must...push....through...the system!!
@_date: 2018-04-05 03:34:27
Most have limits of transferring money out.

My wife's family is in India and bought some this morning!
@_date: 2018-04-10 00:07:01
Touche! Yes! Go Bitcoin lol
@_date: 2018-04-12 05:40:41
Seriously!? There needs to be common sense of course when trading....This was so stupid. He's mad he jumped in and empty pool and that it hurt lmao...Natural Selection takes its course.
@_date: 2018-04-05 05:19:18
They banned me in Nov. Cause I'm an MSB after 10 months with em.
@_date: 2018-04-09 14:49:39
No it isnt!
@_date: 2018-04-05 02:54:37
Will they allow an MSB to open an account? Most other banks won't.
@_date: 2018-04-11 00:11:08
@_date: 2018-04-05 05:24:26
How would I get ahold of him? Seems like a long shot. I never did anything illegal. Had 94 Bitcoins with them at a point. They just up and pushed me out.
