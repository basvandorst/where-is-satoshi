I had a shirt made with my seed phrase printed in big letters on the back.
Been wearing it out in public for almost a year and the 0.1 BTC is still in the wallet.
Not even joking.

It's because the ElectrumX software is poorly documented, difficult to configure, and hard to use even by someone with development experience

As an Australian I apologize for Craig Wright. He is a shame of Australians

Can I buy one off you as a present for my dad?
I'll pay a good price that's worth your time. Please PM me if you can

Would the position be full-time/part-time, or just casual advice?
Could we learn some more about the project?
I've developed functional enterprise level wallet systems for about 20 cryptocurrencies, can program in Solidity, and have a solid understanding of Blockchain. I'm not super advanced in the scripting languages of any single currency except Ethereum though.

Irrelevent unless they are US based. The SEC is not the world police. It's very arrogant of people from the USA to assume the world has to worry about their obscure regulations

If I'm not mistaken it costs a decent sum of money to trademark something, so once it's invalidated they have mostly wasted their own resources and time

What can they really do against an overseas company with no link to the US?
They can't extradite individuals, because it's the company that they have to take action against. And they can't seize money if the ICO was performed with cryptocurrency

I wouldn't count this as FUD.
Satoshi solo mining is not a bad thing. At the time BTC was worth nothing and he invented it, of course it's going to have to be centralized before it becomes decentralized

Lol they took more than 6 months just to verify my ID documents. I'd completely forgotten about them and moved on to other exchanges when I finally got the email saying I'd been accepted.
I can 100% believe this wait time is credible

Banks are actually in a better position than ever before financially.
We all love BTC, but banks aren't going away anytime soon.

Anyone with Omnicore and a copy of the BTC blockchain can verify the number of Tether in circulation with a single typed command

Comparing fiat currencies like USD and Zimbabwe is like comparing Bitcoin and Bitconnect as cryptocurrencies

I support Bitcoin but I don't like these arguments.
Objectively speaking more digital currencies have already failed than fiat currencies, with a shorter average lifespan.

Don't stress, this is a very easy brute force, the possible combinations will take a couple minutes at best for a computer to try

As a software engineer who has been in similar situations upgrading legacy systems I felt really bad reading this. I know how it feels to have the public on your back, the CEO breathing down your neck, while everything you do to the codebase seems to break more shit, and the stress level of the entire situation rapidly spirals.
I can picture the exact fiasco as it would have played out: A bunch of devs working 20 hour shifts, dripping sweat, while they desperately try and figure out how to get everything working again. The customer service staff are repeatedly brought to tears by irate customers as the phones ring off the hook. Meanwhile, everyone else just paces around the room trying to keep the panic out of their voices when they talk.

This is why it's time for new alternatives to LocalBitcoins.
Check out  it's decentralized, no verification requirements, more currencies, and a profit sharing model.

Could we get in touch regarding your skillset?
