RemindMeBTC! 20000

For your first question, it probably just checks if it is greater then the number you put in, not equal to, and if it is not it should be literally 1 character change (maybe 2 or 3 depending on the language) to make the reminder go off.

@_date: 2017-12-07 11:39:49

@_date: 2017-12-07 11:58:41
How much do you think it will drop at 20k?
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:23:37
What makes you think this, or is it an absolute guess?
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:44:23
Youre pretty much begging. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:11:55
In what way?
