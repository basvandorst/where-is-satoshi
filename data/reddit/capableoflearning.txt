How come that there are many many more people than you who may have lost their savings, but they're able to shut the fuck up? =) thought about it?

Yeah I think I'm with you on that. OGs are definitely not the majority of readers, I mean I don't even count as an OG I guess as I didn't even experience Mt.Gox... and on top of that there are enough OGs that also enjoy memes... 
I guess I just had to spurt out some anger which accumulated over the last 2 years. Man, this roller coaster guy got posted every 100 bucks we went up.. it was obnoxious at some point.

Well I guess you deserve a big thanks from the people who are still visiting this subreddit on a daily basis. But I think I will stay over at and as long as there is no policy banning the "artwork"-shilling and limiting the memes to like 2 per page or something like that. Not that it makes a difference that a random guy is not visiting this subreddit anymore, but I still wanted to state my opinion on that as I **was** a regular visitor through 2015 and 2016. 
Oh yeah, and ban the word hodl, that would help a lot.

could you (/anyone) explain this "squeezing shorts" term?
I always thought this means that people who short bitcoin just take their profit when the price goes up due to whale'isch movement...
@_date: 2017-02-21 12:39:00
so there is a szenario where we might see a second huge bearwhale if the price keeps rising like this and the Chinese guy can't cover up the pops with buying more positions? (assuming that [this]( was some sort of similar thing)
Edit: I noticed that I haven't thought through this correctly lol. Obviously when a short gets popped the person who shorted has to **BUY** off of the market instead of selling. Which would cause higher demand. Got it. And thank you :)

Your line of argumentation is so strong dude. Thumbs up.
@_date: 2017-02-21 12:16:13
so basically , the squeeze refers to contracts where people who shorted bitcoin HAVE TO pay the 10 BTC back to the person who borrowed them from when price rises above a certain limit (50$ in your example) and the process of "squeezing" means the price gets closer and closer to this certain limit? And the "pop" means that the certain limit has been crossed? :)
And do you have a reference to 


? Would be very interesting to see. Did I understand correctly that this Chinese(?) big guy lost a shitton of money because he just tried to increase his position further and further because he couldn't accept his loss?
@_date: 2017-02-14 09:17:46
you think the price movement is directly connected to the Flynn thing? I thought it would be a reaction to the good news from China..
@_date: 2017-02-13 09:06:36
it's not "really" manipulation in the first place. It's the PBoC again. Last twitter post from cnLedger:

ah ok. I thought you meant the trade engine. Like when Bitfinex got hacked it "froze" ;)
Edit: regarding price, if it would be impactful, we'd have seen price movement before the news come out. Usually insiders sell before it appears on news. That's when the price movement already starts. But in general, there's no real price movement since or before then. :P we safe I guess.
@_date: 2019-03-13 12:11:21
Okay I think I understand the AMP scenario now and I also think that it does not really fit what I was talking about. My scenario really is only one route that has limited capacity and that the end useres of this route want to use the route for a payment that is bigger than the capacity of the route. So they split up the payment into multiple smaller payments that fit the route and are executed subsequently. So if the limit is 20$ and you want to route 100$, you just send 5x 20$ from your channel to the end channel. Would that be possible? Or is the risk to high that one channel might get closed in the process or something similar?
@_date: 2019-03-13 12:12:25
But if the 40$ payment is completed, is the channel from node3 to node4 not at 40$ capacity again and can be used for a subsequent payment? 
@_date: 2019-03-13 13:00:13
Yes I acutally meant the balance. When the payment arrives at node6, the balance of node3 and node4 changes back to their original state again, right? 
It's first 40:0 (node3balance:node4balance), then 0:40 and when the payment is completed the balance is 40:0 again, so that, theoretically, the next 40$ payment could go through the route. That's what I mean. Because to facilitate a payment between node1 and node6 , the balances of nodes 2,3,4 and 5 only change temporarily. When the payment arrives at node6, the balances of 2,3,4 and 5 go back to where they were before the payment happened and thus are ready for the next 40$ payment.

I bought all my bitcoins in september last year when price was 480. I got a little in touch with Hodl already :p not pretending to be a senior or something, but I've sat in the rollercoaster at least once already.
@_date: 2019-03-13 13:01:47
is there no possibility to notify or something like that? Or maybe the wallet could check the channel states (-&gt; balances). If the wallet sees, that for example node2 is at the "old" balance again (the balance before the first 40$ payment), the wallet could interpret it as "Okay, the route is ready for the next payment again." or something. Unfortunately I'm not too tech savvy. :/
@_date: 2019-03-13 10:13:43

@_date: 2019-03-13 13:26:25
Seems as if I'm retarded. all the time I thought of the LN in a wrong way. I always thought the channel balances would be rebalanced at the end of each LN transaction so that the balances of the intermediaries would be the same before and after the transaction. My bad.

If this post doesn't get more upvotes than that roller coaster shit (funny the first 3 times, not funny the next 2.205.025.205.108.103.125.676 times), yes, we'd need a new subreddit.
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:53:34
I'm not quite sure if this is the right way to calculate that. I'll give it a shot myself:
I subtracted the size of every block they mined from 999kB and added those all together coming to a total of 9507 kB of missed transactions. According to the [mempool]( the top 9507 kB of transactions are in the range of 280+ sat/byte. Looking into the total fee table, there are sitting 33.9 BTC in there at time I'm writing this. Assuming they'd consume all of these if they included the transactions into there block they'd have 33.9 BTC more than now. 33.9 BTC @ 4300 USD = **145.770 USD**
Don't know if this is a senseful attempt at calculating this. Feels correct tho.
@_date: 2017-01-06 13:30:45

(the one full block is included in the 4 blocks which are bigger than 900 kB so there are 14 "other" blocks)

There are some blocks which include SegWit transactions, so those blocks are not mined with ASICBOOST. Some have no SegWit transactions tho
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:03:41
~~*max blocksize is 1000 kB~~
*max blockweight is 4000 which corresponds to 1000kB if there are no SegWit transactions included in the block.

(title states something like "Digital currency Bitcoin on bull run", city of 20.000 people, local newspaper) 
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:03:17
Normally, blocks are something like 999.XXX kB in size bc the blocksize is 1000 kB. Miners should try to stuff as many transactions into blocks as possible to clear the mempool so transactions get confirmed faster. In AntPool's blocks, there's much free space for transactions but they're not including them into their blocks. Reason for this? I can't tell actually. Could be sabotage, could be wrong software, could be busted ASICboost, ... it's just an observation.

Sounds good so far, support is vary important. 
Thing is I would only use USDT as a value store for a few hours / minutes. Because as long as I can sell them 1:1 for the "actual" $ price and BTC drops, I can buy back in the BTC and just increased the amount of BTC I have. Never considered selling or using USDT. I just don't know enough about ETH, ETC, XMR or ZAC to blindly trade into them if Bitcoin stagnates. The fear... ;)

@_date: 2016-12-26 12:55:02
I want to explain to my friends how the process of mining and sending Bitcoins work but I'm not 100% sure how it works. 
I understand that mining is rewarded with coins (currently 12.5 / block if I understood correctly?). The full node which is lucky to mine the block will be rewarded. In case of a pool, the reward is more or less divided into parts equal to the hash power everybody puts into the pool. So now you have Bitcoins and can send them. (Eli5 version) 
Here are my questions (and if my sumup above has mistakes I HIGHLY appreciate if somebody could correct me) :
Is mining the process of confirming transactions which are in the memepool atm? 
If so, do all Bitcoin transactions go into the memepool? 
If so, how does the memepool work? Like first come first served? Or are there transactions who will never be confirmed because no node is picking them up? 
Then, "blocks": one block is 1mb big and is filled with transactions untill it hits "the current block size", right? Is this block size the size people are debating about all the time? 
How does the reward system work exactly? Is it like the person who adds the last transaction to a block gets the entire reward? If yes, how does it work? Does this person automatically have a wallet? And what is actually sent to him? I always read about (private) keys and stuff. And where do they come from? It seems as if a god sends private keys with which you can identify your new Bitcoins out of nirvana into your wallet.
How can Bitcoins be lost for ever?
What is in my Bitcoin wallet? Is it a Bitcoin or keys to a Bitcoin? If it's the key, what stops me from keeping the key, then send the key to multiple addresses?
That escalated quickly.. I'm sorry for having so many questions. Additionally English is not my first language. Please excuse me if I sound like an idiot. I appreciate every response. :)
@_date: 2016-12-07 22:01:47
Sounds good for everybody who has some bitcoins :) thanks for your explanation!
@_date: 2016-12-27 15:10:44
Thank you very much for answering :) there were very many things that I haven't had any clue about. Thank you really!
Also some of your answers created some more questions. I hope I'm not too exhausting ;)


I always thought it was a very big pool where all transactions go b/c there were certain articles and posts on here where people complained about "the mempool" filling up. (For reference: [[1]]( [[2]]( What are those people talking about? Is it like most full nodes and there mempools are just structured the same way and thus look so equal that one could just call it "THE mempool" b/c it looks similar for everybody who runs a node?


If you run your node in a pool, what keeps you from sending all the 12.5 coins to your own wallet if your node is the node which is allowed to determine the address? Or is it like you transfer all the power over your node to the pool's administration and THEY can send the 12.5 coins from your node to THEIR wallet and distribute them afterwards to all miners participating in the pool?
And what is actually being sent if one says "sending bitcoins"? The way I understand it for now is that transactions are listed in blocks. Those blocks are listed on the blockchain. And if your wallet is notified or notices that a transaction with its particular address is listed on the blockchain, it will just add the number of coins to the wallet which is determined in the transaction. (and thus nothing is acutally being sent to a wallet). And the private key is just to show everybody (without showing the key) , that you're the owner of that wallet. Is this somewhat correct?
Thank you very much for your time and sorry that I'm answering late. Time around Christmas is not filled with much internet time for me ;)
@_date: 2016-12-27 16:54:56
First of all thank you veeerrryyy very much for your effort. You're really the part of the bitcoin community I like most ;) it's like spreading "the word of bitcoin". And I will try to get as many of my friends in the boat or at least interested or informed about bitcoin as I can. Thanks to your answers. 
So there came some more questions to my mind, especially about the transaction-system.


So basically the miner verifies your transaction privately, and as soon as the current block has found its solution (this math problem thing), the transaction is written down into the block? How could anybody know if there still enough space in the block if everybody would verify transactions privately? In other words, what would happen if miners are faster in confirming transactions and thus reaching the blocksize faster with transactions, than the block itself found the solution to the problem? Wouldn't there be an extreme amount of confirmed transactions which could not be written down into a block because the block is already at the 1mb barrier?
And another thing about the blocks: is the process of confirming transactions and solving the mathmatical problem whose solution is written down into the block the same process? If no, who is doing which task? Whos solves the problem, and who confirms the transactions? Would both be possible tasks for a full node? (reading about a "full node" in this moment, are there "not full" nodes?) and how does that all relate to the difficulty? How can it be so dynamic? It's so fascinating...
Thanks in advance. I really appreciate your effort :)

@_date: 2017-11-17 23:07:43




May I present to you: the community guidelines of this subreddit. The buzz terms you should look out for are "news", "discussion", "new information" and "avoid repetition". Which would basically cause every meme to disappear because the memes on the front page are reposted several thousand times and have absolutely nothing to do with news, information or discussion. Can't argue with this. Period.

I swear to god we need a third subreddit for Bitcoin right about now if the mods don't make a meme-filter system for this subreddit. I mean like, I'm not the guy that's against memes in general, I actually love memes. But the memes in this subreddit are so fucking low effort, contentless and make the real Bitcoin-news, the purpose of this subreddit, disappear.

The mods didn't reject my suggestions, they have a tunnel vision for censoring stuff they don't like and are not doing ANYTHING else. It is not about me having bad ideas. It's about them not caring about anything else. the simplest solution would be to implement a flair system for memes. If you've got a problem with this solution, that makes YOU a selfish child who has never heard of the word compromise. Everyone would be happy with that solution. There wouldn't be "an expense of every one else" and this has never been my intention.
Additionally the community did not reject my post. Otherwise it wouldn't have made it to the front page. There are many people who're just annoyed by the memes and agree with what I'm saying. Posts like mine come up on a regular basis.

That's a good point. But I think it's not a flawless point because it assumes that fees are inevitably going to go down at a point where the transaction is going through. If we look at 2017, there were many people who thought like you, but fees rose so rapidly that their transactions were never included in a block and dropped out of the mempool. 
Taking your example, the 1-2 days transaction would only go through if fees would not start rising in the coming days. If you're unlucky it could very well happen that your transaction is not going through. Also saving 95% on fees seems a little bit anecdotal (I really don't want to sound mean or anything). Taking my example, the median transaction fee in Sat/B was around 50. For you to save 95%, you'd need to get a transaction included in a block with a Sat/B fee of 2.5. 2.5Sat/B transactions were not cleared from the mempool for over a month at the time. :/

The thing is, I'm not quite sure if what you're saying is even possible. Not every person who is using the internet is running his or her own DNS server. The internet only works because we have those few and we more or less have to trust them.. don't we? Ofc they're somewhat a huge risk vector but what better solutions are there? 
In addition to that, Moore's law should apply at some point. When there is more and more bandwidth for less cost, more disk space for less cost etc. as Moore's law takes effect, so should the blocksize increase to allow scaling. Or is that an utterly ridiculous thought? The full-node-operation-cost should be equal if the bandwidth cost goes down but bandwith usage goes up due to bigger blocks.

Thanks for your input. I think there were some TILs in your comment for me.
Most importantly, the closure fee being three times as large as the next-block fee at the time of the cannel creation is very interesting. I think there haven't acutally been periods where


this happened. So that's good. But on the other hand what this means is that it's economically not sensible to open a channel with a balance that is smaller than the combined fees for opening and closing the channel. If we're sitting inside a tight fee-competition like in late 2017 this might be a problem. 
What I'm trying to say is, if the blocks are full for a too long time period, there might be people who are excluded from participating in LN if they only want to make micro payments. Let's make an example:
It's 24.12.2017 and I really want to start using Bitcoin as a payment system for small regular payments. I see that the fees (for now) are very high and I know that broadcasting very tiny payments to the blockchain is just not sensible. So I think "Hey, why don't I just use LN?". I go ahead and think about what I'm going to use it for and how it be most sensible. Let's say I drink a coffee every morning when I go to work. That coffee costs 1$. I work 20 days a month, so I go ahead and open a 20$-LN-channel with starbucks as I don't want to lock up too many of my funds in a channel but also not too less. I want to open the channel on the 01.01.2019 so I can buy myself a coffee every morning before work in January. The median fee on 01.01.2019 was 14.26$ ([bitinfocharts]( which would mean that I'd have to pay 14.26$ * 1 (opening) + 14.26$ * 3 (closing) = 57.04$ in fees for using a 20$-LN-channel. (I hope I understood what you said correctly.)
Ofc you can go ahead and say that micro-payments are somewhat utopian for Bitcoin, like the coffee-payment-example. But I, as a user, really wish this was a thing because it would be extremely cool and imho this would be a very good thing to increase adoption. Ofc you can also go ahead and say that late 2017 was a worst case scenario.... but to be fair, if we don't think about worst case scenarios we would be bad in risk management.
@_date: 2019-04-08 10:31:03
I think we don't disagree on many points. The only thing me might disagree on is the priority of things. If I understand you correctly, you think that people not running full nodes because of their complexity is the biggest problem right now because we need way more full nodes to secure the mobile wallets. Imo that's perfectly reasonable. 
But I think there is no scenario in which a big portion of the Bitcoin users is going to run a full node because people are too lazy to try to understand it. What we had to do would be to smuggle a full node into their systems without them "really" knowing about it. Like your router example. That would be very nice because if it was running on its own without maintenance, the user would probably not care too much. But for this scenario to happen, there would need to be mass adoption first and imo mass adoption is held back if the usability of Bitcoin is decreasing over time. 
Also according to your argumentation


a blocksize increase wouldn't dramatically decrease the number of full node operators if the increase is somewhat sensible (not f***ing 8mb like Bcash lol). 
@_date: 2019-04-08 11:12:24
But what if the high fees exclude people from participating in LN?
@_date: 2019-04-08 08:56:28


The LN may need bigger blocks because otherwise the anti-scam-mechanism does not work. If somebody wants to scam me, I just broadcast the channel state to the blockchain, right?. But if for example the channel balance is smaller than the transaction-fee, there is no way to broadcast it to the network. I mean you can broadcast it ofc but the chance of it getting into a block is extremely low if the payed fees are well below average.
If the blocks are constantly full and the transactions/10 minutes rate is higher than the blockchain can process, the fee competition is going to start again which leads to increasing fees, bit by bit. And as fees increase, LN gets more vulnerable because more and more channels lose the ability to protectively broadcast their channelstate to the blockchain as the fees rise above the balance of the channel.
I would be very happy if I was mistaken here but I'm relatively sure that I'm not mistaken. Please change my mind if I'm wrong.

I'm totally with you on that and I also read and responded to the comment you linked. It's nice that there's improvement but the way we achieved it was imo not optimal. The way it happened was basically through pain. Back in the days before SegWit was acitvated (May-Jun '17) the first big mempool backlog occured which made Bitcoin a pain in the ass to use. The thing is that it was a pain in the ass for the **users** and that's what I'm a little bit sad about. The users basically had to complain to exchanges and other service providers and also complain in general that fees are too high and that there has to be something done about it which led too the UASF which then forced the network to integrate SegWit. This was not civil at all and the costs were big. I mean, humans learn best through pain I guess, but is there really no other way to prevent 2017 from happening again? Like solving the problem before it occurs again and causes pain for the end user?

Yeah, just lable any discussion that doesn't fit your agenda as FUD. Nice way of engaging with things buddy.
@_date: 2019-04-08 10:35:42
Thank you for your input.
I never argued about a limit being senseless. There should always be a limit. But the limit should not harm the usability to the point where using LN as a 2nd layer-solution for micro-payments becomes un-economical. See the example I've given in the other [comment](
@_date: 2016-02-18 08:23:04
That's so fucking cool :) I would love to have one, but I'm from Germany unfortunately :/
@_date: 2019-04-08 11:23:18
Channel factorys might enable opening multiple channels in one transaction... Maybe someday there is a decentralized channel factory that can open hundreds of channels per transaction. Like what batching did to exchanges
@_date: 2019-04-08 13:04:08
the channels should be non-custodial, yes. Otherwise it would be a very bad soluation since custodial services stand somewhat against Bitcoin in itself. I honestly don't know how the factories would be set up though.

stay calm. This is happening all the time. This is not even a drop worth mentioning in the history of bitcoin. I invested into bitcoin 1 year ago, when the bubble rushed from 200$ to 500$ and then back to 300$. I invested all I had  (I'm a student, and yes, that was hell of a retarded move). Know what I learned from that and from the halvening? BTC price is volatile as fuck, yes, but it is eventually going higher step by step. Compare the entire history of bitcoin. It recovered from all its deaths. And believe me, this little 30$ drop is nothing. See you in 2 years ;)
@_date: 2018-03-05 18:52:57
no. The point I'm trying to make is actually a reference to a [post]
( that has reached hot on this subreddit. It was about a tweet of a shill type of guy who makes a big deal out of virtually anything which is related to core. People like this just spread their "us vs. them"-mentality and do no good to the ecosystem. He also tried to make a big deal out of the block which had 65% witnesstx in it. My point is that it's not really worth mentioning (=trying to make a big deal out of it) it because there were many blocks in the past which had way more witnesstx.
@_date: 2018-03-03 18:53:31
I can't understand why sane people still follow these guys. They're the shills from our side, right at the spot where Roger and fake Satoshi are for Bitcoin Cash. They're trying to make a big deal out of everything Core-related. They twist everything so that it fits their narrative. 
This^ is basically no news. There have been blocks with more than 80% segwit transactions. See here:  . I've been following these guys, also Ben Verret, Richard Heart (although this guy might just be trolling 24/7), and the like and they're more or less just creating noise. My advice is to follow people with big minds (,  is the best example for high end non-biased technical discussion about Bitcoin) instead of big mouths.

and Coinbase is definitely not filling this entire space every day. Millions of transactions per day is just plain bullshit. We're below 200k transactions per day atm. Even if, and that's a big "if", Coinbase was 25% of those, they'd do 50k transactions a day. Not 1m. The only thing that MIGHT be possible would be millions of outputs.

I think somebody should just prevent ppl from panic selling their btcs now to prevent popping the bubble right? :d
@_date: 2015-11-11 06:18:03
Your answer is pretty much what I expected. Thank you very much. The good thing is that I've never spend any of my money because I don't really know what to buy. I'm 19 years old, earning round about 1.000€/month and I don't really feel broke by now. 
I already informed myself a little bit about BTC. I don't know if it's just naivety again but there's one argument which caught me: "BTC is a currency with a limited amount of money. As it is totally anonymous, there will always be users willing to pay for it. And as we all know, a limited and demanded recourse will always increase in value over the long term." this is why I didn't panic sell at ~430. I believe that there's a day when BTC has to be on a higher level than a week ago again. I don't care if this day cones within a month or 40 years. I just want to come out of this story with +-0 or better.

I personally came here to know about Bitcoin, to get into interesting discussions about it, like to extend my knowledge all in all, step by step. Wether it's about how it works, about wallets, maybe even about the price once in a while (I personally don't like price-talk either in this subreddit, bc imo it belongs to and this f***ing roller-coaster guy is the biggest circle-jerk in the history of humanity), how to secure your Bitcoins and also about PRODUCTIVE discussion about scaling and BTC-technology in general. But the past X months was just like "BU IS BAD. SEGWIT IS GOOD. AND BTW, ACTIVATE UASF)))))))))". This is just retarded.

yeah, it's because of UASF, ofc. Because every person who heard of Bitcoin once in their lives know what a "fork" is, right? It's not because the price is rising. I mean, that was basically every time the reason why the google trend went up. But this time, it's TOTALLY different because the news reported solely about the new super soft fork which is going to kick in, and not about the rising price. Holy shit people in this subreddit are so fucking narrow-minded and can't see ANYTHING else apart from this dogshitfucking scaling debate.

I guess I've provoked some false assumptions in my title. I'm holding Bitcoins for almost 2 years now and have been following the scene from the time I owned the first ones on. I just wanted to enhance my knowledge about how Bitcoin works since I've read many opinions on why SegWit would be very bad for Bitcoin. I didn't want to be to biased and just follow the hype-train, and this is why I want to understand Bitcoin to a ... somewhat full degree so that I can form my own opinion.  But I still thank you for your warm welcome note. :) and the vs. shenanigans just annoy me. I feel you.

this is senseless. So far Bitcoin is no threat to the banking system. There is not a single chance that in like 2 years or so the financial world is overtaken by bitcoin. Thus there is no relation between banking stocks' value and bitcoin adoption as of right now. The point is, if he (and his advisors) would think that Bitcoin could be a revolutionary asset or technology, they'd just ditch there banking stocks and buy Bitcoin instead as Bitcoin would, if the revolution would acutally come, provide waaayy bigger profits than any bank stock. Imagine how much he'd gain if he buys as many Bitcoins OTC as he can from liquidating his bank stocks. He'd easily tenfold the entire holding of Berk if another bullrun like the last one would occur.
He's not trash talking Bitcoin because he's in fear of Bitcoin being the revolution everybody in here wants. He's trash talking it because he just believes that it's trash. Simple as that.
