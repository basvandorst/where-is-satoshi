You are 100% missing the point. Don't spend money you don't have on crypto, especially if it's on a credit card. Plain and simple.

Honestly, you shouldn't be able to buy crypto with a CC. If the coins you invest in do not have a higher return than the ridiculously high credit card interest rates you'd lose anyway. 
When you use a credit card you're using money you do not have and turning it into a currency that is tangible and treated as cash by a growing number of vendors - sounds a lot like a cash advance to me.
There's a saying in investing, "never invest more than you can afford to lose". If you don't have any money to invest (credit != money) you shouldn't be investing...

So, you're trying to tell me that you'd rather use a credit card to buy crypto instead of using money you already have, such as bank card? That's just stupid.

 You're right that not all cards are "credit cards", however that is what my comment was targeting.
Also, when you use a credit card, whether it's just to pay bills and accumulate points or not, you are still spending money that is not yours; until you payoff your balance. 
Specifically, in this instance paying bills is not the question at hand, it's purchasing crypto with the intention of trading or hodling. Either of which is indeed debt. If someone has 5k cash and they decide to buy 5k worth of crypto on their CC instead doesn't that show that they are not willing to lose their own cash?

No, you're not in debt while eating at a restaurant...unless you choose to pay for it with your credit card. 
You're example really has nothing to do with the topic, the debt we're discussing here is specifically when you pay for something with a CC. Buying anything on credit is debt until you pay it off.
