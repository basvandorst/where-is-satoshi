Just wait. Look at the bitcoin growth chart over the last year, it's still growing exponentially. It is normal that people sell before christmas.

Why is everybody having problems with transactions? I pay nearly no TX fees from my core full node and the transaction is really fast.

Bitcoin cash (fake Bitcoin) is crashing since yesterday.

This "crashing" is just people selling before christmas. It happens every year.

I invested my money in things that are not a scam and actually have a real value :)
Did you switch to bitcoin "cash"? How much money did you make in the last month? How much money did you make when bitcoin rose from 8k to 15k ?

At least it's not a scam like BCH.

Run a core full node and backup your wallet. It's more secure than some stupid company.

It is a good opportunity for new people to buy bitcoin.

Bitcoin is the best crypto currency. Just look at the exponential growth and how much shit it survived.

It's fake. Police searches of your home (Hausdurchsuchungen) are never 5 PM. They are always 6-12 AM. And 5 police officers and 2 guys? This is just fake.
