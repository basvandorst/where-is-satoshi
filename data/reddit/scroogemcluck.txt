I see what you mean, but if it grows to as large a scale as some people dream, then in 15 years they will still call 'us' early adopters.

I just really learned about bitcoin a couple of months ago. I can't say I understand every single technical aspect of it but from what I've read it seems to have enormous potential and a lot of behind the scenes momentum. Regardless of the long term success I think it is a truly remarkable experiment and I'm enjoying the ride. It's rather exciting to think (daydream) that we are the ones who joined the financial revolution near the beginning.

Not that I've found. I'm assuming you're in Canada (debit card) and every exchange website that I looked into in Canada requires ID to link a bank account. The only other option is localbitcoins. I ended up just sucking it up and signing up for an exchange with my ID. I don't see what anyone can do with a picture of my driver's license.

Oh my god. That was amazing. I just saw this for the first time, greatest 3 minute example of bandwagon jumping I've ever seen. This is the human nature that drives Bitcoin adoption. To the moonwalk.

PeerToPeer Value Transfer Protocol (P2PVTP), or something like that. Then you let it get called bitcoin in everyday conversation and the skeptics can still have a technical sounding name to mollify them.

Well I'm in Canada so I'm not 100% sure how it works in the states but from what I've read most exchanges follow KYC(Know Your Customer) regulations which involves some form of ID. Maybe someone living in the US can give you more accurate information.
