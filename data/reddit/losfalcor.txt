 How will this effect btc prices
@_date: 2017-01-19 23:10:26
Just as a reference, I ended up using local coins cause I thought there was no fee in the invoice. I paid 487$ and got 425$ in btc. Not very good at math, but I think that's more than 11%

On blockchain app it guides you to load via an Athena atm in downtown,  so I figured they were closely linked 
@_date: 2017-01-20 01:01:31
Which is about 15%. Idk if that's the users fee or PayPal fee. So in short, think the btc atm is better and saves money

I did it before, just can't remember how much the fee was. If it's 40$ or so,  I can live with it. Beats the drive, gas and time for the convience.  Currently checking out the Athena website to find out about fees

Does this include blockchain? I'm a bit lost here
@_date: 2017-01-17 21:43:40
Apparently it's 11%

I have been getting spam, but I know better than to reply. I didn't mean to post my real email. Overlooked it. It's been changed. The only bitcoin sites I've been to lately is blockchain and localbitcoin exchange. Have these sites been compromised..  also, what might be hacked? My email. My phone, my bitcoin account?

Yeah. Last night i placed two transactions about 30 minutes apart. The first one got confirmed after 50 minutes. The one after has yet to be confirmed and its been about 24 hours. I attempted to use viabtc transaction accelerator but get error 'submissions are beyond limit. Try again later'. Hopefully this kinda thing doesn't crash?

I get error submissions are beyond limit
