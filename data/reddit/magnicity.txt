I haven't received any bitcoins yet so it's not an issue.  I remember reading that a blockchain was not stored locally and so is more vulnerable to theft.  Is there much reason to worry?

Hmm, doesn't sound secure.  I just broke out a pc with xp that I haven't used in years and only then for about 10 min so it's pretty much brand new.  I think I'll use that to process bitcoins until I get an android.

Thank you.

Thanks, I'm doing that now.

I'm in California using Astound on a MBP.  I doubt it's my ISP unless they've grossly overexaggerated the speed we purchased, which is possible.  It's not my account though, so there's nothing I can do about that.  I ran disk utility tonight and repaired some permissions on my mac and it seems less sluggish.  I'll be scanning the pc all night for viruses/malware and then I'll try the bitcoin software on that since it's like new  with almost nothing on the hd.
edit:  it's like new but it's a lemon with a rattling hard drive so I will use an online wallet on my Mac for now.

Lol at "suffer".  I guess this is a first world problem - Bitcoin syncs so slowly that I had to pull my other computer out of the closet to use!  And now my desk is crowded!

I haven't received any coins or even properly registered the thing, it was just slowly synching after the initial d/l.  I already delleted it earlier then ran disk utility and corrected a few probs.  I'll probably do the Electrum on the Mac tomorrow just to get started then leave the pc to d/l the full thing.  Thanks for all the help everyone.  I hope to get this done because I am intrigued.

I've read tons about that and it is my fantasy.  My pc is a lemon though and I'm going to try to get dell to replace it although it's been [awhile](  When/if that happens I am THERE!  :-)

Thanks to everyone for the help.  The pc is busted so I'll try the online wallet, electrum or multibit later this evening on the Mac.  I'm determined to make this work!

Good info.  I'll look into it.  Thanks.
