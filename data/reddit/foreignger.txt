so is it better to leave BTC in exchanges so that u get the Clone coins added right away?

just like BTC is not 100% going to keep going up right? I mean if you suggest to just bitcoin at that price then it's the same thing as what I am currently trying to do, right???

Guys I need help.   I have been trying to buy bitcoins but I do have a 250$ limit per week @ coinbase.    I cannot take advantage of any dips that happens.   Please point me in the right direction. I wanna invest about 2k when it dips.

Where do I get the keys? I don't remember putting in a password or keys. This was way back in 2013.
Can I just import my wallet file into bitcoin core and get privkey from the debug console?
also how much is .32 mBTC?  Probably not worth downloading the whole blockchain over it?

let's say I have an account with bittrex and coinbase which doesn't accept trading in my coins into FIAT currency( canadian here).
What is my option to turn it into monopoly money???
Sorry for the newb question but I have yet to cash out any of my hard earned money(100 CAD)  but I intend to dump. more in the near future ( around 1-3k).    I just wanna make sure I will be able to cash out.    What are my options?    I know I can sell them on Kijiji etc but is there an easier way?    Selling through brick and moretar ATM is an option too but the fees is ridiculous.

I can download bitcoin core and retrace the see there right?

im really not chasing alts but the way things are right now, it's almost a given that the alts will go up.   As you can see I want to convert it back to bitcoins when the price is right.

ok thanks but how much is .32 mBTC worth?
