The ATM, which Coinage operates, lets you buy Bitcoins using cash or sell them from your digital wallet, withdrawing cash. The price of Bitcoin at the ATM in this video is based on the Bitstamp exchange. 
And the process is a bit more involved than what you may be used to with a typical ATM—to comply with money laundering regulations, users need to scan a government-issued ID (and a sample pubic hair).

Just want to add to point 1. It's too slow for retail transactions.
It can be slow to become spendable too:
Briefly, a while back I sent 0.07 to a friend of mine towards paying for an 'item'. He wanted to settle the cost using BTC from Mycelium on in his S3  (but did not have enough 'credit') .
The transaction appeared almost instantly on his phone but he could not make the payment until a confirmation made my BTC tx spendable. Confirmation 1 did come and the purchase was settled but it was like 15 minutes later. 
I understand that zero confirmations are OK for small transactions, but for BTC to become spendable taking that long it is really not ideal in many other instances.
A faster way to get the 1st confirmation through would make Bitcoin much more usable. 
Saying that, I fully believe in Bitcoin,  as for security I am ok, MtGox is taking care of mine atm. ;(-

Contrary to public speculation, Bitcoin CEO Mark Karpeles will have you know that after halting virtual transactions on his "Magic: The Gathering Online Exchange" for the second, and likely final time, that he has in fact not run away with any all too real money that may still be found at the now defunct exchange of virtual stuff.
*Dear MtGox Customers,*
 
As there is a lot of speculation regarding MtGox and its future, I would like to use this opportunity to reassure everyone that I am still in Japan, and working very hard with the support of different parties to find a solution to our recent issues.
Furthermore I would like to kindly ask that people refrain from asking questions to our staff: they have been instructed not to give any response or information. Please visit this page for further announcements and updates.

Chinese people can read Chinese and talk to each other on IRC and forums, considering these factors the selling on exchanges (especially Chinese ones) has been going on FAR FAR  too long to be just another rumour. **But lets keep an open mind until it is 100% clear, we'll see how it turns out by the next 12 hours**.
Accounts must be shut by April 15, preventing investors in the commodity that advocates promote as a digital currency from doing fund transfers to the exchanges, according to a Caixin news report citing a notice sent to banks and third-party payment companies this month.

Britain’s tax authority plans to ditch its levy on Bitcoin trading only days after the collapse of Mt Gox, one of the virtual currency’s leading exchanges, losing almost $500m of customer deposits.
The UK’s welcoming approach to Bitcoin contrasts with the approach of other countries, amid concerns about its use for tax evasion and money laundering as well as its notoriety for wide fluctuations in value.
In a meeting with a group of UK traders last week, HM Revenue &amp; Customs said it would not charge the 20 per cent VAT tax on trades, which entrepreneurs had complained made their businesses globally uncompetitive. HMRC went a step further, saying it would not charge the tax on their margins either.
The ruling sidesteps the thorny question of whether to class Bitcoin as a currency, but effectively treats it as such, and bases its policy on the EU law that exempts payments and transfers of “negotiable instruments” from tax.
Governments worldwide have wrestled with the conundrum of how to deal with virtual currencies, as businesses hoping to profit from a small but growing economy have lobbied for regulation that would allow them to flourish.
High quality global journalism requires investment.

*If you connect using Bitcoin-QT the other peers only know that you are broadcasting a transaction, they will not know if it originated from you or someone else.  There are no IP addresses in the Blockchain.*
The confusion comes from the web site Blockchain.info.  They list a “Relayed by IP” address but that is just the first IP address they saw broadcast the transaction, not necessarily who originated the transaction.  It is easy to configure Bitcoin-QT to connect to peers that do not publish IP address information.

You appear to make assumptions and judgement from unqualified and misinformed research, yours it is indeed an amateurish counter productive bitter and pessimistic exercise.

My opinion is that as part of the interpretation of this new currency border control, Bitcoin will also be included within the tax. The authorities will have to acknowledge Bitcoin under a currency status and not commodity and VAT should only be charged on the service attached to the transfer and not the currency value.
I am aware that you don't have to declare such transactions, but if you want to turn your BTC to fiat you have to enter the banking system , the fun then begins.

The remittance Market is HUGE, the flow of Bitcoin is essentially towards 'third and fourth' World countries.
 
The problem at the moment is that these countries do not offer easy ways to cash out or spend Bitcoin locally. 
So, for this to take off we need the infrastructure at the receiving end,  here it is a new HUGE opportunity to invest, anyone for it? (Bitpay?)

No charge
Customers can use the Paym service, which will be embedded into existing mobile banking apps, to send small amounts of money using a mobile number, without requiring a sort code and account number.
The system will ask you to confirm the name of the person receiving the money as an extra security check.
Customers without a smartphone can still register to receive payments, although a smart phone app is required to send money. Customers will be able to send up to £250 a day through Paym.
Payments made through Paym will usually transfer instantly through the Faster Payments system.
Later in 2014, Clydesdale Bank, First Direct, Isle of Man Bank, NatWest/RBS and Yorkshire Bank will sign up to the service, followed by Nationwide Building Society in early 2015. Metro Bank and Ulster Bank are finalising their plans.
Paym – pronounced "Pay–Em" – will then be available on more than nine out of 10 current accounts.
To make a payment, customers can either select a contact from their phone or key in a mobile number. The app will ask you to confirm the name of the recipient and the amount before the money is sent.
Adrian Kamellard, chief executive of the Payments Council, said: “Our research suggests that every adult in the UK is lending just under £5 per week to someone they know. Small sums like this soon add up, so it’s great that Paym will give people a new option of quickly and securely paying someone back – whether it’s for lunch, a train ticket or just a cup of tea.”

*The recent attention given to Bitcoin and Coin (  )- the two newest stars in the financial technology world – vividly illustrates that there exists a major demand to simplify the financial lives of consumers. Coin packages up to eight cards (debit, reward, membership, etc.) into one “Coin” swipeable card. Bitcoin is the Internet of Money and makes online purchases anywhere faster, simpler and anonymous*.
*While the popularity of both innovations has grown quickly (even though Coin is not yet available), they still face key uphill battles because of their unconventional path to success by not partnering with a trusted financial service provider first*.

Extract Financial Times
	
Bitcoin is facing the biggest test of confidence in the nascent virtual currency, after its oldest and most famous exchange went dark and customers feared the loss of $400m worth of Bitcoin.
Mt Gox – a contraction of Magic the Gathering Online Exchange, after its origins as an exchange for the trading cards game – suddenly deleted its Twitter history and then pulled its website offline on Tuesday, prompting a swirl of rumour and recrimination.
Calls and emails to Mt Gox spokespeople seeking comment on the allegations were not returned, but while it remains unclear exactly what has happened, the exchange’s customers were coming to terms with the likelihood that they will not see their funds again.
Mt Gox had suspended customer withdrawals last month, but continued to allow trading, even as concerns mounted. It blamed the restrictions on a “bug” in Bitcoin, which allowed fraudsters to make it difficult for exchanges to track transactions, but other exchanges said they had implemented fixes for the problem.

The data points of connection at the end, the blockchain in this case are non valid in referring the originating IP once it is masked through layers and packets encryption on the way to it. The origin has to be caught, backward tracking is not as simple as reversing data.
 
IPs can obliviously be traced before network stealth gets implemented and logically at the start of the tx.  A 'standard' connection can be spoofed and recorded at any point in time.
blockchain.info and coinbase connections don't work the same way.

So Mark had no financial motivation for 'stealing', it would have been counter-productive and unnecessary,..... some say.
The shut-down of the exchange appears to be the result of something that has been brewing from quite sometime, months, years maybe. 
MtGox has been having 'problems' far too long. 
So if it is not financial, could it be technical? keys, back up, cold storage whatever mess that was? But to go unnoticed for so long? Don't think so.
Damage Bitcoin reputation:
1) A third party envelopment, Government/s + back standers (TPTB) Banks? Wanting MtGox to fail big time so to damage Bitcoin reputation? Countries can be destabilized, surely this exchange is not untouchable. 
2) Government Transactions Enquiry:
Request of information about all transactions with gagging orders attached and data restrictions been applied to block transit of Fiat and Bitcoin, practically known as seizing.
We may never find out the truth. Mark is starting to look like the victim not the guilty party. But which one is it?

Google, the search giant, is working on incorporating bitcoins into its payment solutions notwithstanding the controversy surrounding the virtual currency.
"We are working in the payments team to figure out how to incorporate bitcoin into our plans,"
Sridhar Ramaswamy ( )  from Google Payments, told Jarar Malik, a bitcoin enthusiast and founder of J.A.M Studios, a music studio.
Malik also conducted a survey at the behest of Google, which showed that users wanted the search firm to incorporate bitcoins into its payment solutions.
About 5,935 people submitted 1,395 suggestions and cast 52,960 votes, in the survey that was commissioned by Ariel Bardin, V-P, Google Payments.
Interestingly, in the survey most users wanted Google to incorporate Dogecoin, one of the fastest growing crypto-currency.
The top echelons at Google too share the enthusiasm about virtual currencies.
Eric Schmidt, former CEO of Google, feels crypto-currency should be more influential. Jared Cohen, director of Google Ideas, also says crypto-currencies, not necessarily bitcoins, are inevitable at Google and everywhere, but it needs more regulation. Both Schmidt and Cohen recently wrote a book called "The New Digital Age" and are on a book tour.

U.S. firms are pushing ahead with plans to open bitcoin exchanges catering to professional traders, after the closing of a Tokyo-based exchange sent shock waves through the virtual-currency world.
Perseus Telecom,
 a provider of high-speed telecommunications lines for securities exchanges and trading firms, is joining forces with bitcoin-trading platform Atlas ATS
 and Strevus Inc.,
 which produces compliance-management tools for financial institutions and other firms, to build one or more U.S.-based digital-currency exchanges in the U.S. and elsewhere.
The move by Perseus comes after SecondMarket Inc., a platform for trading shares of private companies, said it is putting together an exchange in collaboration with a number of global banks and bitcoin companies
The push is being driven by strong demand for bitcoin-trading capabilities from Perseus's clients in the high-frequency trading industry, said Perseus Chief Executive Jock Percy.
The firm has created a separate digital-currency unit and already has received $2 million in revenue commitments, the company said. High-frequency trading firms use computers to dart in and out of markets within milliseconds to profit from minuscule pricing advantages.

Why trying to justify what Bitcoin is turning into, comparing it to shitPal or accepting $1 fees, that makes it useful to just a small spectrum of users. Face it, as it stands now this is not the Bitcoin I, or anyone else bought in 2011/2013, the global acceptance view with low fee and fast transfer has turned into a fking joke, the magic is now a nightmare. 
And lets not even go into technical bullshit that eventually segwit, LT ... how, when?????? and on and on, it does work for everyone or it does not. And it does not right now. 
Feel free to downvote, just keep watching it slip away. Core doesn't want or seem unable to brake this inpasse and BU is kicking it hard as it loses credibility. 
Nothing can hack Bitcoin, that was one of its major strenght, so? but it looks that there is another way to destroy it and it is happening. Are we awaiting for a miracle? Never gonna happen,  ffs lets get the magic back into Bitcoin. Now. Happy?

Added this now 
Wake up 
as fredititorstonecrypt said 12 days ago 
I don't understand.
Ethereum now has developers at all of the world's largest companies working on it.  Bitcoin has people developing applications on top of the network. Ethereum has more people working on the protocol itself.
Bitcoin's basic programming language is incredibly simple. All of bitcoin development is limited by effectively having to be written in the equivalent of BASIC.
Changing a cryptocurrency's underlying feature set often requires a hard fork. Bitcoin hasn't hard forked since 2010. People might be writing amazing new features for it, but the bitcoin network hasn't adopted any of those new features.
Speaking practically, what changes to the bitcoin core code have been made in 3 years, compared to everything that ethereum's been doing? We can't even get SegWit implemented, and Segwit is the equivalent of a 2 week project in the ethereum development world.
What specifically has bitcoin developed that isn't available on the ethereum platform? I can name 30 things that ethereum has developed that bitcoin hasn't. As far as I know, every feature of bitcoin has been copied into the ethereum platform.

It was about Bitcoin losing ground to Altcoins, it was inviting a discussion  about Bitcoin needing to address and solve network issues now or fading away. 
 Ref:
3 years ago, nearly 100% of transactions that were submitted to the network were confirmed within 30 minutes. Today, that number is &lt;50%, and more than 10% of all transactions submitted take more than 5 hours to confirm.
And the transfer of Bitcoins into Altcoins continues and accelerates as I am writing. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 18:30:42
“Bitcoin Core is 95 percent of the developments of Bitcoin. It’s people who have dedicated their lives very often at no pay to do this for years. I don’t subscribe to conspiracy theories. Three years ago, we were wondering about how we are going to fund developments. Now we have a very well funded team of Core developers and a very robust team of Core developers.

No matter how you evaluate or use strategic plans, variables are by definition variables, there are no calculations that will edge you a guaranteed positive return in this volatile space. Only inside trading can really help you, or, use your instinct and common sense and go for it. 
FYI I am passionate about Bitcoin, but I must admit I am unfaithful sometimes, but only when really necessary.

*For me, it is good news that Chinese GOV ban cryptocoin trade, which will definitely promote global cryptocoin market to be healthy. Chinese miners or traders are not loyal to the ideology of cryptocoin and what they only care is how much profit they can make from it, which has become the cancer of the whole cryptocoin market. There would be another big step for Chinese GOV. I believe that they would cut the power supply from the hydropower station to mining farms, which means disasters for super mining farms.*

 So you can buy more and after you want Bitcoin to shoot up again. What a clever idea. 
I want Bitcoin to go to $10000 so I can sell before  it 'crashes' to $5000 and buy more. Same Bitcoins, just different parameters and opposite way of thinking.

DON'T WORRY your fee is good,  as for right now, 12 hours max should do it. After the first confirmation comes in the next confirmations should come much much faster.

At this point in time, in order to get Bitcoin to fulfill its operational sustainability we need 'crazy' ideas.  
Crazy ideas are the norm with crazy people, but they can work extremely well when passionate thinkers decide to do whatever it takes for as long as it takes in order to get shit done. 
Luke is passionate and crazy in a positive way. Now,for example Roger  Ver....is,&lt; fill in  this space&gt;. Take your pick

It's never a good idea to shit on too many bitcoiners at once. Mark Karpeles was confronted by Kolin Burges back in early 2014. 
Not everyone is polite and courteous as Kolin, the world is full of crazy people doing crazy things.  
BIP 148 is a bit late,  WU can just retire laughing with millions coming out his rear. What's more he is not doing anything illegal, but seriousely how would you/anyone else act in his place?

Miners should not have such a dominating power over Bitcoin structural implementation. Unfortunately, unless we have &gt; a Core solution to this, nothing will change soon and again it will re-surface at a later stage when financially viable.
Bitcoin will have to wait. 
If mining was concentrated in the USA instead of China it would make no difference. Can't blame the hated miners if they take this profitable easy given opportunity. They don't give a shit, but would you?

It is psychologically relative to gdp per capita. 
In SOMALIA $0.003 to $0.006 is a big move, in LIECHTENSTEIN $3000 to $6000 is a big move too. 
I think, for both scenarios, unsustainable is a very loose definition that does not take account of other important parameters.

Briefly cause I am on mobile and travelling, I hope it will help you.
others can also advice you, you could try this:
First make a few copies of wallet etc info you have in a couple of separate folders.
If you are on  Windows,
Download MultiBit latest version
Install it,
Close it,
Go to My computer&gt; Windows&gt;Users&gt; click the name of your pc User&gt; AppData&gt;Roaming&gt;Multibit&gt; swap a copy of your original wallet with multibit.wallet in your possession, keep both wallets copies in a separate folder as back up.
Start MultiBit
Now you should need to let multibit update, syncronyze all the blocks , could take a day, once Multibit is fully syncronyzed you can send your Bitcoins to any Bitcoin address you want , using the wallet password you said you had, or just keep them there.
If that doesn't work download an older version of MultiBit Classic
  and follow the same steps
