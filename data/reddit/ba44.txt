like I said you dont have to fund it!!!!!! god damn. nobody has to  fund it. just have fun cracking!? what the hell. why are yall bitching over a opportunity to win a free bitcoin? I dont get it. if you think its a scam then dont fund? simple as that

thats up to yall. I'm not funding it anymore. I will check the wallet everyday and every time I see that It has gone up a btc I will drop another hint. This isn't suppose to be a quick thing. I want a lot of people to see this and attempt it! The hints do stop at 500 but like I said, after 20 hints it should be pretty crackable. I whole idea is to get the wallet above 1btc so the winner gets more then one btc. This could take a year, who knows. Just a fun contest to past time.

YOU DO NOT HAVE TO FUND THE WALLET! YOU ARE WELCOME TO FUCKING GUESS. ITS A FREE BITCOIN. STOP BITCHING AND TRY TO SOLVE IT. IF YOU THINK ITS A SCAM THEN DONT PARTICIPATE. SIMPLE AS THAT.

what kind of charity could i work with to do this??? and if I did this then the winner the cracks the code only gets 1btc so that defeats the purpose. Like I said nobody has to fund it. Its there for people to try to crack. I could care less if someone cracks it or not. the btc is there and will remain there until someone finds it.

you're not paying me at all. I swear im not stealing funds. its sad that everyone assumes that people want to steal btc but thats the negativity that comes wtih btc due to its past. I'm not really trying to go out of my way to help someone get free coin lol. nobody has to fund it. you can attempt to solve it without hints. idcccccc. its one btc... I seriously have a wallet with over 200 btc in it, swear. Think I really care about ripping someone? Have fun. Im done responding to commetns! if you dont want to participate don't, its that simple

Thank and yes I understand. someone stole 40 coins from me when I first started. I just dont like to be bashed when IM giving away 100 dollars... wtf. but I see why people are concerned. if you go to my bitcontalk page you will see that I made a change and will upload one hint a day just in case it doestn get fund. I have no intention of scamming people and just dont appreciate people attacking me when Im giving away something.

nobody has to fund it whatsoever! you can look on my bitcointalk.org page. Im a jr member. Im just promoting btc. Idc if nobody funds it at all. the btc will remain in the account until someone does. call it a scam if you want but you dont have to participate! promise ha
