This is stupid. That $2500 he lost is FDIC insured if it was fraud done through a bank/credit union. The charges easily get reversed. If your PC is infected with malware and your coins are stolen, you are absolutely fucked. Not wise to keep savings in crypto IMO, but to each his own.

Edit it with notepad. Do you see anything you have typed before such as what you wrote on this thread? If not you're likely fine. Alot of junk is in %temp% not only keylogs.. and not every .dat file is where keylogs are stored. :)

Seriously..? Close all of your browsers/instant messaging clients, open CMD as an admin and type netstat -n
This will give you all of the connections being made to your computer.. you were most likely hit with a rat or some other sort of malware, meaning it requires an internet connection to access your pc. You will likely see some odd foreign addresses and can look into them. 9/10 it will be a VPN/RDP connecting to you..
You can also run netstat -b in CMD (as an admin) and it will show you active connections + which process they are coming from.. check %temp% and %appdata% for any .dat files outside of folders... or suspcious folder names with files inside of them.. This is usually where keylogs are stored. Most of the time you can open the file with notepad and you will see plaintext logs. &amp; Finally, run system config and check for anything out of the ordinary under the 'startup' tab..
Let me know if you find ANYTHING at all that is questionable. I bet tracing this moron down that stole your coin would be cake, and they likely do not know how to properly clean that much money.
