Does he have a predictions website you can link?

Much crash. So excite.

Government debt is always at an all time high since it never goes down, so that point doesn't count.

Sounds like a similar theory to the one about JP Morgan and other banks suppressing the price of silver and gold (to make the dollar appear stronger.)

They can never buy all of the bitcoins. Even if one bitcoin existed it could be divided up as much as needed.

Will you be able to put them in a taco?
@_date: 2012-09-11 01:48:47
Fuck it we'll do it live!

You have "open source" and "open", which are similar. You could replace one with something like "fast."

I wonder how many were lost in wildfires, hurricanes and other acts of nature.

Please delete the article about wolves too. As I have never seen one in real life, I can confirm they do not exist as a real animal.

I would guess that there is a significant percent of people who want or have bitcoins but do not know about the reward halving.

No thanks.

Trolls will be trolls.

Sorry, not using anything that isn't from bitcoin.org
@_date: 2011-12-15 03:02:36
I'm too lazy to go through all these, but one of them might do the trick  
@_date: 2013-04-06 01:32:14
Maybe this is good. Bitcoin is too dependent on MtGox.
@_date: 2013-11-28 02:26:47
But the item wasn't priced in dollars.
@_date: 2013-11-22 00:52:23
Sell sell sell!

Cue FBI raid in 3...2...1...
@_date: 2013-07-25 01:42:18
Banning people who know people that know about bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-05-14 23:29:32
I'm sorry but there is now a $5 fee for going outside.
@_date: 2013-02-13 00:14:52
Try paying your taxes with it.

Mostly because merchants are too lazy or have other reasons why they don't want to charge two different prices for cash and credit.
