I sent in almost 100 dollars. They of course wanted photos of my ID so of course I sent them. They immediately sent an email saying that they were not good enough quality try again. So I took pics of it again. Then 6 hours later then declined my payment and accused me of fraud, "called me a fraudster", but still charged my card.
Your payment request has been declined.
Please note that we do not disclose the reason for declined payments. **This is because unfortunately we have seen these reasons being used by fraudsters to create fraudulent transactions.**

Please note that your credit card has NOT been charged. The funds have been placed on authorization hold in order to reserve the amount in case the payment was approved. Since your transaction has been declined, this authorization check will be voided. This typically takes the bank 48\-72 business hours \(not including Saturday or Sunday\). Please let us know if you do not see the funds released after that time.
