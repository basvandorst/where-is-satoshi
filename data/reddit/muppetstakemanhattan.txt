Feedback is easy to fake and you've been caught lying about how long your site has been in business.
@_date: 2016-08-05 13:55:51
You're having trouble finding the exact match because it is rarer than the others, they are not offered for sale very often and you should get a good premium for it.  I'd pay 1.5btc for one.  You should check out bitcointalk.org collectible section.

He's talking about ether, many smart speculators are putting a percentage of their money into it and buying their position.  I converted 30% of my Bitcoin as a hedge and I'm pretty happy with my positions.  I'm long term Bitcoin and still deciding on ether because it is still young and unproven with a long roadmap left to travel but the potential is there just like with Bitcoin.

You are not correct, please learn about the subject before you speak, in this case BIP38.  It is very good and even a short password using a mix of Unicode characters can be impossible to crack.
@_date: 2016-01-24 18:39:16
I'll post a wallet to this sub later this week when I am better equipped to generate it.  I think 1btc should be enough to entice people to try.
Actually it shouldn't be because it's basically impossible to crack!
@_date: 2016-03-06 15:54:53
If you replace ethereum with Bitcoin and smart contracts with crypto currency your post reads differently.  But I don't disagree with you either.
@_date: 2016-01-28 02:07:22
Yes, there is currently an altcoin pump and dump in progress and I'd speculate that the price of bitcoin has been flat because people have been putting money into buying a position in that coin. 
@_date: 2016-01-25 10:40:21
That makes no sense, why even have the site then if it doesn't matter?  Because they want it to matter and if it does why would I trust them?  Obviously I wouldn't because it can be gamed.
@_date: 2016-03-05 16:58:16
Diversification into other viable alternatives.  There is really only one other horse in the race right now and if you're a smart speculator you will hedge one against the other.

Hey everyone, it's alright we can trust them, they're verified!
@_date: 2016-01-25 09:36:38
The admins can just create a bunch of verified users to do the same thing.  Why should we trust them?
@_date: 2016-01-20 02:12:45
  
Google searches are flat since November 2015.  People arent looking at it.
@_date: 2016-01-21 02:51:15
This is the answer
@_date: 2016-01-24 16:51:13
I'd be happy to encrypt a BIP38 wallet and let you try to crack it.  I'd bet any amount of money that you can't.
@_date: 2016-01-20 02:02:30
I've had this discussion with merchants and told them they would pay less in fees if they accepted it directly and some have said they just don't care, it's not worth the training and book keeping hassle.  The thing hindering merchant adoption is ubiquity and that doesn't come over night or even over a few years it takes time.

How do you achieve stability when the asset backing it is not stable?
You'd have to manipulate the supply and in that case we have fiat already filing that role.
@_date: 2016-09-17 04:13:33
What?  How do you get priced out of something you can buy tiny amounts of?

I do this for fun.  I made a bunch of paper wallets with .02 btc on them back in 2013 and I occasionally leave them or hide them in certain situations.  They all say clearly to redeem them and how and I've left a couple of dozen over the years and only two have been redeemed and both of those are very recent.  I'll eventually sweep the ones that weren't redeemed.
