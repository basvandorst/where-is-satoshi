You're going to have a go at someone for being pedantic online? You must be new.

TBH the crash has only made me want to buy Bitcoins, i feel like an idiot for not buying in at £10 or so way back when.
Only i have NO freaking idea how to, even having read the FAQs and whatnot. I don't really 'trust' coinbase like websites from what people have said about them.
Oh well.

Hence why i'm not, and do not claim to be an investor.

if 1btc is $600 then you have to pay roughly $600 for 1 btc... i fail to see your question.
It's like saying "how much can i pay for a ferrari? I don't have £100,000 but i want one"?
You don't need to buy a whole bitcoin, you could buy 0.1 or 0.01 or whatever.

I didn't downvote every time i replied, i downvoted you all at once after a few replies. 
Generally i never upvote or downvote, i downvoted because i disagree that your comments add anything to the discussion, isn't that what they're for?
Either way you seem rather angry about something so i'm going to be on my merry way, whether you're annoyed i was pedantic or not i answered his question which is what he was after.
Have a nice day.

If his question was how much can he pay for 1 btc, it's exactly the same.
