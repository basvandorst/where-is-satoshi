Governments use AML as an excuse to invade your privacy.

My girlfriend is Bitcoin.

I’m not sure, but even if lightning is successful, people will still find value in BCH for philosophical reasons and also because BTC has strayed further away from the original white paper.

The ATM service provider prices the Bitcoin in your local currency, so you would need to use Canukistan dollars.

1 bitcoin would be worth 1 bitcoin and maybe a sandwich with chips and a drink would cost 10 Satoshis.

And what happens if most of those transactions are done on the lightning network?
@_date: 2019-07-12 17:53:50
I am so sick of hearing the black market argument.
@_date: 2019-07-08 20:08:38
Yeah, that’s a Bitcoin ATM. Is that in an airport or a mall?
@_date: 2019-06-27 11:53:26
Read the Bitcoin Standard and Digital Gold if you get a chance.

Begone thot!

Yes, but the meme is referring to no coiners.

Quick maths.

You would make a billion dollars.
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:34:55
No, it’s not too late to buy. You need to decide for yourself though. It could go up a lot higher, but it also makes sense for a pullback.
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:24:36
If hypothetically most transactions would take place on the lightning network then wouldn’t the BTC chain be vulnerable due to a lack of on chain transactions and therefore a lack of miners?
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:54:34
I’m not sure. Consider buying from a bitcoin ATM in the future and have it sent to a trusted wallet.
@_date: 2019-06-28 01:33:01
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:52:10
Thanks for the answer.

I prefer using a picture of a trash can to explain lightning.
@_date: 2019-12-30 12:17:00
About $3.50.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:05:25
Yeah Bitcoin ATMs do charge high fees, so that’s the downside. As far as refunds go, they will still need you to verify your identity, so I don’t think you really have any options unfortunately.
@_date: 2019-09-07 18:03:51
Check this out. 
Some ATMs don’t require an ID. It depends on your area.

He should put together a petition and send it to Bitcoin. Oh wait....
