That simply isn't true. The land price is not the only factor. The price of the construction of a home in USD per square foot has gone from about $21 per sq ft to $120 per sq foot from 1973 to 2013.

That's true. Building technology has changed. Although, they actually use less real lumber now. I believe I saw in another source that the 2017 rate is about $150 per foot. My only point is that there is inflation. The USD is losing its purchasing power in multiple economic sectors. I have no intention to oversimplify. There are lots of contributing factors to price changes.

In order to get the roughly stable rate that this article suggests, they have to "inflation-adjust" it. 
And it is almost $150 USD per sq foot in 2017 
The dollar is losing its purchasing power for housing, and not just for land.

My bet is we end up in a multi-crypto world, just like we have now, but bitcoin is one of the major answers.

I completely disagree that there is no inflation. There may not be inflation in low end apparel, or in electronics, or in plastic toys. Global efficiencies, technology and competition have applied enormous deflationary pressures on these categories. However, in medicine, in groceries, (particularly quality or organic foods), in restaurant prices (both low end and high end), in real estate, in rent, in utilities and in event ticket prices, and across most equity classes, we are seeing rising prices. There is definitely inflation. And yes, I understand that rising prices and inflation are not the same thing.

The negative trolls are out in force today.

Really interesting. However, given the volume increases on the street, it makes me wonder if some exchanges are self-enriching and manipulating the price with fractional reserve practices. Thoughts?

I like that he or she remained anonymous. Thank you. God bless and farewell.

I hope someone who receives one of these has the courage to go very public and loud, and not comply with the no disclosure rule. No disclosure rules in a "voluntary" investigation letter are deeply wrong and, in my opinion, unconstitutional. These no disclosure gag orders are meant to keep people from organizing. We shouldn't stand for it.

I live in Utah County about 20 minutes from Provo. I'm going to Provo tomorrow for a business lunch. I can sell some bitcoin to her for cash. Send me a PM.

This is a great list to show what differentiates you. Very impressive.

An API key is NOT a Bitcoin Address. They are very different things. Coinbase provides addresses to which you can send bitcoin, but they are not the same thing as a wallet where you own the private key. It is more like a bank account, as Coinbase controls the funds. I've never used Bitfinex, so I can't help you there.

Fantastic. I love how the BTC symbol is formed by the negative space - as if it is emerging from the space between the fiats.

Anything Peter Schiff says about Bitcoin is suspect. He makes his living selling gold.

It also says a lot about humanity's relationship with saving money. One thing crypto is changing is the way we save. It is a good thing.

Yeah, it will certainly feel outdated for longtime bitcoiners. I think Rise and Rise of Bitcoin started production in 2011 or 2012, and released in 2014 in October. Production for Life on Bitcoin started in July of 2013.
