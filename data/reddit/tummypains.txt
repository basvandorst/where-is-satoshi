The way I treat BTC-






@_date: 2018-04-22 01:58:18


Visa knows.
Shift knows.
Coinbase knows.
You know.
So instead of keeping all this cash, you keep more bitcoin.
You stop relying on USD and begin to DCA your income to bitcoin.
Now imagine if 300,000,000 people were using Shift.
The taco bell manager is using it. The CEO is using it. Maybe nows the time to accept BTC directly?
How do you not understand that every transaction = more adoption?
@_date: 2018-04-22 02:21:20
Im convinced you are either anti BTC, or some buttcoin/fed reserve shill. No one could be this dumb.
Adoption is good. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 00:11:17
Taco bell can deal with adoption. If 100% of consumers were willing to spend BTC, maybe taco bell would have a feature that makes it cheaper for them as a merchant.
@_date: 2018-04-22 00:34:41
What exactly do you mean it doesnt use BTC at all?
I have 0 USD in coinbase. So it spends BTC.
Taco Bell might convert it, but thats their problem.
If everyone starts using these cards, they will see demand for BTC.
@_date: 2018-04-21 20:05:38
Either, whatever works. 
EDIT: I suppose I prefer something with 2FA so someone cant break in and steal it.
Theyd need to break in and hold me hostage too.
@_date: 2018-04-21 22:08:47
Everyone needs to GTFO coinbase right now.
If the US decides to ban BTC, coinbase will freeze everything.
@_date: 2018-04-22 00:56:16
This is laughable.
Do you know what consumers even are?
They are 50% of the transaction.
If you think adoption is better using USD, you have no idea what makes up our market. Everything is trade, and having a bitcoin bank between me and a merchant puts everyone one step closer to BTC adoption.
@_date: 2018-04-22 13:02:07
Yep, need a wallet.
@_date: 2018-04-22 01:59:38
It has 0 fees.
I'll trust that.
Until taco bell has QR codes for bitcoin, this is a way to spend bitcoin everywhere.
@_date: 2018-04-21 22:07:32
This news has convinced me to close my account that has existed since 2011.
They have 100% lost my trust. 
@_date: 2018-04-21 19:33:51
Well guess thats the end of my time with coinbase, been using them since 2011.
Where should I move it to next?
Was thinking about doing a USB wallet somehow. Whats the modern way people are doing it?
@_date: 2018-04-21 20:05:17
Trezor is expensive.
Why not store everything offline in a USB?
@_date: 2018-04-21 20:03:53
They are locking accounts.
The entire purpose of BTC is to have control of your own money.
Coinbase lost my trust. 
@_date: 2018-04-21 23:03:57
It reduces my need for USD.
We shouldnt discount that.
LN does not let me pay at Taco Bell.
LN is probably best for peer to peer.
@_date: 2018-04-21 22:09:36
Coinbase to coinbase + Shift card had solved all of my problems for BTC without fees.
However then they fucked up with Wikileaks and now I need to bail.

Chem engineer here.
Nuclear chemistry may(or may not) be around the corner.
If we find some new energy solution or method of nuclear engineering, gold will be made like diamonds.
I dont think gold is safe in our lifetime.
