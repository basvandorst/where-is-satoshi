You mean how do you prove that you bought bitcoin had it since the land before time and if Bitcoin is actually worth a lot. Sounds to me they just don't want to make you rich.

I don't know when or if I will ever get the chance to buy anything early enough so that I could cash out big. I bought it back in the day to basically buy need and other stuff. I never once thought of it from a stock market kind of way. With the amount that I was considering buying if I allowed myself to go broke I probably could of had a house 75% of the way paid for.

I am hoping that Dogecoin will allow me to get a 2018 Chevy Impala but by the time it takes off there will probably be an EV vehicle that is better in every way.

What is the consensus here? That bitcoin will come back or that "bitcoin will never die. It keeps going up and up."

I second the losing investment part. I got $2,400 worth right now but when I bought it it was like $450.

I saw that post yesterday and all I thought about was Buddy's book from the movie anger management.
