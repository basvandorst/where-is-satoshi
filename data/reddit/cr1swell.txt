How is that misleading? I'm gonna go ahead and assume you've never traded anything before (not just crypto).
The exchanges profit from this same behavior, it's business.
@_date: 2018-09-27 03:55:45
And it all has nothing to do with the price of BTC being traded, crazy huh?

Mass Adoption /s
We need education before Mass Adoption.

No you can't. Have you tried it or did you just read a headline? 
@_date: 2018-08-30 02:29:46
You just use a broker/coinbase and authorize yahoo finance to access your account and share details. That's a hard pass for me.
@_date: 2018-08-02 07:35:19
Gee. I wonder who wants all their BTC to suddenly be worth more before this rejection (yet again....) In the 8200-8400 range.

Shit news, price is down. You really just skipped 12 months of price suppression. Please educate yourself, do yourself a favor and delete this shit post.

Replace Banks with Exchanges and it still holds true.

Yet another post that sounds like every other "Crypto Influencer, Advocate, Proponent"
What you fail to realize is that the price of BTC has nothing to do with Bitcoin and/or Cryptography.
When more and more people realize it, the general interest of "hodl"ing and buying bitcoin will eventually die down. 
This isn't what will be used as a currency going forward. We aren't there yet, we still have a shit-load of work to do to find out what the majority consensus will be when deciding on THE currency (that's right, just 1) that will be used as a potential global currency.
All these current crypto-currencies are just bullshit, they are useless and will have zero value in the future. Maybe as valuable as pogs or something similar.

This sub never had it, most communities and echo-chambers rarely do. The politics of these moderated discussion threads rules over any real back-and-forth rhetoric.
@_date: 2019-01-23 18:19:31
is it though?

And then invented a way for shitcoins to PAY binance to list their shitcoin to pump &amp; dump and exit scam while abandoning the project on github.

I think we get the double top attempt then get rejected, we need to test the waters of 5200-5500 range again to see if it holds. For reference, My char has been pretty fucking spot on this entire year, most recently one of my last posts to show what I'm looking for during the summer.
