Ugh. The US dollar doesn't mean cash. It means the US dollar which I can use with my debt card. I thought you were a financial advisor. I think a financial advisor would know the difference between cash and dollar. I leaned that in first year Econ. 
So basically you've been getting pissy because you didn't understand the question to begin with. Good times. 
So many mature people in this sub.

See you're not actually answering any of my points while I continually respond to yours. You seem to be getting angry by this bringing my age and education up is kind of irrelevant and insulting.  I've been nothing but polite to you and only asked you questions I honestly am looking for an answer for because it doesn't make sense to me.  Im sorry if your answer's don't seem like real benefits to an average consumer to me but would you prefer I lied and said they did?  But like I said I have no background in finance so here I am trying to learn. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 04:46:25

"Current system won't be able to go on forever". Firstly what are these huge issues and why won't the system be able to go on cause I honestly can't see them. Second I could be wrong but isn't that kind of a limitation of Bitcoin in that there's a limited about of coins that can ever be produced?
I like most people are not interested in speculation or over throwing of "corrupt systems". What I'm wondering is why is it beneficial for my mother to buy her morning coffee with Bitcoin rather than the US dollar.  I think that's the barrier you guys will
Have to over come to make this thing mainstream. 
@_date: 2016-08-01 22:21:59
Thanks for the dick answer to an honest question douchebag.  Considering I thought the goal was to have Bitcoin used by more people educating the wider public on its merits is something that's going to have to happen and dick answer like this will just further alienate people. 
If you're unable to tell me any reason to actually use Bitcoin that's a different story. Then you're just trekking out dick comments to cover for your own ignorance. In which case go away your opinion isn't valued. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 02:56:51
Thank you

See you really are crazy. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 00:31:55
Oh no I appreciate the knowledge dude. After being attacked for being a troll on here repeatedly you're a breath of fresh air. 
See I'd disagree on the email comparison again because the phone could t provide the same kind of information that email could that could be stored and pulled up again if needed. 
And yea like I said having reversible transactions is something I think most consumers would want. I personally have received charges on my credit card not made by me, made a call to visa and the charges were removed. If it was Bitcoin my money would have been gone. 
I don't deny that it's a fascinating technology that most likely will be very important in the future. I just don't see it being used on the consumer side anytime soon. I see the blockchain technology being used to speed up and secure our current banking system but not do away with it. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 07:17:08
True about others using cash.  
Friend loaning me cash in a cash only situation is kinda an obscure way to show how useful Bitcoin is though. Maybe I'll be in a cash only
Situation while still having full access to my phone and also in quick proximity to a friend with an abundance of cash will to trade for Bitcoin is not very likely not to mention I can't remember the last time I was in a cash only situation. 
Assets do get stolen but I we we speak about Bitcoin as used by the average consumer.  My bank and credit card have both been stolen and had money taken from them. With Bitcoin I'd be shit out of luck. With my debit and credit things were straightened out and funded quickly. 
Honestly not trying to be a dick or anything but I still don't see it. I get that the tech behind Bitcoin probably will be important going forward but as far as Bitcoin becoming a commonly used currency in the western world I just don't see happening.  I just don't see enough people having enough problem with their day to day banking for Bitcoin to seem like a viable alternative.  Speed doesn't seem to be a benefit to the average person since debit transaction are nearly instantaneous including emails money transfers between people. I see the no refundability of Bitcoin to be a negative not s plus since theirs no way to reverse changes or stop payment to a scam. Once your money's gone it's gone where as when my credit card was stolen and used in a scam 100% of the money way refunded.

@_date: 2016-08-02 07:28:29
Well not really average but I definitely agree that the blockchain technology will be important in banking technology in the future.  My question was more on daily usage I guess. The buddies I've got that are bullish on Bitcoin are the type who think it's the new currency that people are going to use day to day instead of the dollar which I just don't see happening. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 05:42:40
No making a typo while typing on a tiny keyboard on a cell phone is a common occurrence for most people . Consistently trying to make a point and failing while spinning some delusion in ones head about a conspiracy to take down Bitcoin through Reddit  that you are going to single handily stop is not common to most people.  That's the schizophrenia talking. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 05:11:50
Basically you're a loser who's accomplished nothing here or in your life and you're very likely suffering the early stages of schizophrenia and should seek help.

It's an issue in that we should be putting regulation in them to prevent flooding the market but at this point it's not a guarantee or ever likely that that would happen.

Jesus what bank were you using?
@_date: 2016-08-02 05:05:34
Lol seriously dude you have severe delusional problems. How exactly did to get me to show my true colours? I had a good conversation with several people here while being interrupted by your obsessive childish trolling. I said in the post title that I didn't see the point in it as use for a consumer. You've  accomplished nothing here and in your life but making yourself look stupid. You are a sad lonely person.  
How exactly is asking how Bitcoin is useful for a consumer on Reddit sabotaging Bitcoin?  Is Bitcoin so weak that it's at risk of being hurt by someone with a 2 month old Reddit account asking a question.  If anyone has sabotaged Bitcoin here it's been you with you stupid ignorant insulting responses to an honest question. 
You seem to be convinced that I'm some secret wall street shill sent here to make Bitcoin look bad. I invite you to check out my comment history. Now if what you say is true that means wall streets been paying me for two month to talk about game of thrones, video games, and US politics and TODAY launched our master plan to make Bitcoin look bad by posting a question on Reddit. Damn you're a genius  our scheme is ruined lol. 
You have delusions of grandeur my friend. You want your life to be more exciting and more importantly significant than it is so you imagine things in your mind like "the banisters are out to get Bitcoin I have to stop them by being a douche on Reddit". This is a serious condition and actually an early sign of [Schizophrenia]( You should seriously get mental help fast before it to late.

@_date: 2016-08-01 23:49:02
I'm just using my mother as a general example of the average consumer who isn't tech savy. 
I can totally see the behind the scenes of the banking system moving into a Bitcoin base technology, I'm betting not with Bitcoin though, I'd assume some other crypto designed with the banks in mind.  That's still not the consumer using Bitcoin though. That's the system using something like it to manage national dollars 
@_date: 2016-08-04 04:51:28
Um because my bank card gives me access to my dollars. Cash debit credit same currency.  Difference being if I loose my debit I don't loose my cash. 
My debit card that holds dollars isn't cash. 
If I loose my debit which is more or less the only currency I carry and what the majority of transaction are done on I cal the bank, Cancel it, and go get s new card. 
If you loose the password and back ups to your saving in Bitcoin it's gone forever as you said. 
So here you've given me your point and I've clearly explained why I don't think it's a benefit. Is anything I've said wrong? If calling me a troll makes you feel better about your inability to convince me you do what you gotta do. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 00:24:25
Well I'm not living in the us and I'm not going to prove it because I don't gamble. 
@_date: 2016-08-01 23:29:25
That 3-5 days is there for security purposes though to ensure a fraud hasn't taken place. From a lot of the lost Bitcoin stories I've heard that could actually be helpful. More importantly your average consumer isn't transferring over 10000 on the regular so not really important. 
I've not tried to transfer money internationally but again not something an average consumer is concerned with. I have accessed my bank account to withdrawal / deposit / transfer money problem free in numerous 3rd world countries, one of which being Cuba, problem free. 
No I live in a first world country. Now when Bitcoin was first brought to attention a few years ago it was at around $1200 us. I checked today and it's around half that, keeping inflation in account it's worth less than half so I don't see this as a viable alternative to volatile currencies either.  
I don't deal with transactions no but your pout is kind of another strike against Bitcoin from a consumer perspective. As I consumer I want the protection to know if something has happened scam wise I can stop a payment. 
The structure of the banking system as it relates to building apps again isn't a concern for an average consumer. 
Again my question isn't about investing it's about adoption. I assume the eventual goal
Is to have Bitcoin used as an actual
Currency, why does the mom who's intimidated by technology want to switch to Bitcoin. Why does it benefit her?
@_date: 2016-08-02 00:03:22
So no answer. Thanks
@_date: 2016-08-02 01:46:46
But, and I could be wrong here, doesn't the fact that there's a limited amount of bit coin able to be produced doesn't that mean that it's inherently inflationary. I mean once all bitcoins are mined and accounted for won't the price sky rocket because of the scarcity?
@_date: 2016-08-04 03:59:17
Yes several times. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 01:11:36
Thanks. You're the one of the very few  people on here who's actually given me a mature thoughtful answer. 
From the consumer perspective this all seems speculative though. Yea the money supply thing is definitely an issue but we're dealing in maybes there. 
Debt is at an all time high yes but debts owed to us are too. National debt isn't the same as credit card debt in that way. 
Interest rates have been stagnant yes but Bitcoin had had several large  ups and downs over the same period. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 01:22:45
Lol How is this a fake post?  Read the fucking thing buddy. I've had a very good conversation with serval people on here. Responded to just about everyone. 
Jesus does it make you feel like a big man to stock people on Reddit. Does that make you feel better about your pathetic life?
@_date: 2016-08-04 04:45:10
Sorry missed this one 
I worked as a bartender/ server regularly up until recently. 90% of people use debit or credit. And using Bitcoin in that situation would be a giant pain in the ass so no advantage.  Again assuming I'm trolling. Again you seem to be getting angry for some reason. I'm not trolling unless you consider asking questions and not agreeing with your answers trolling. I said right in the title of this post I don't see the point in Bitcoin even after having two close friends who been enthusiast for a while. I'm sorry you didn't tell me anything they haven't. 
No if I lost my cards if walk over to the bank and get a new card. What kind of shitty bank to you use?
Yea I really don't think the average person is conserved about the insurance on their gold bars lol. 
Why would I have 500 000 in my bank account?  If I had that kind of money the majority of it would be out in investments. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 00:33:08
Umm I was simply stating what I think is going to happen with it in the future. Not what I think should happen. I have no opinion on would should happen. One of the reasons I'm here asking questions. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:50:46
If you did last before last night you'd be 10% poorer today. Did your bank fees take 10% from you?  If not bitcoins not worth it. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 04:56:58
 But you've already told me if I loose my password and back ups I'm shit out of luck. I don't keep my savings in cash but people do and argue for keeping their savings in Bitcoin. 
I'm not arguing for cash. I'm not sure why you think I am?  I've repeatedly said I don't use cash. 
I never said cash is a benefit over Bitcoin although being that only select retailers accept Bitcoin and everyone accepts dollars I'd say it does. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 05:53:33
Again quit lying we both know you have 
@_date: 2016-08-04 05:25:07

@_date: 2016-08-03 17:50:16

@_date: 2016-08-02 01:31:01
Lol dude yours is 10 month older. What does that have to do with anything? 
If we're talking about the validity of accounts you may notice that you're karma's at 164 while mines 2277.  Not that i give a fuck about karma but it seems more likely that yours is the shill account.  Did the banksters send you here to make bitcoin look bad, cause if they did its working.
If it makes you feel better about your poor decisions to assume everyone who has an opinion different than yours is a shill account you do that but I'll tell you delusions of grandeur are another sign of severe mental disorder. I really hope you get the help you need before you hurt yourself.

Deflationary not a good thing though. Kinda hard for an economy to grow if the value of goods and services is falling. What incentive would I have to start a business. I'd make a huge investment and what I produce may be worth significantly less by the time I production moving.

Wasn't really going for votes I was asking a question but you just keep telling yourself what you gotta tell yourself to keep from feeling depressed about your life.  I got some very good mature answers from several people while you were throwing your tantrum 
Does it make you feel good to be an asshole
Online?  Do you have so little importance in your day to day life that you have to come on Reddit and stock people to feel better. That's really creepy. Again through this thread I've provided links to several mental health services groups that may be able to help you with that. 
@_date: 2016-08-01 23:36:12
First thank you for the mature honest answer. 
See I don't see it like email because when email came out there was no easy alternative ways to instantaneously send text based messages. Bitcoin there is alternatives. If I want to transfer money to a friend right now I can do an email money transfer in seconds and doesn't cost me anything. Yes I pay banking fees but those cover a myriad of other services offered by that bank as well including security and the ability to stop payments.  That and most people don't transfer money that often. Not as often as they send messages. 
Good point on the third world though. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 02:31:48
So if it's no issue to keep your coins yourself what's the point of keeping them in an exchange?
@_date: 2016-08-02 00:25:44
If assuming that anyone who questions Bitcoin is a troll sent by the "banisters" (you lost all respect when you used that word) makes you feel better about yourself you go right ahead and do that. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 00:58:34
Again continue making up stories to yourself if it helps you feel better about your life. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 05:19:46
No I'm not a fan of using credit cards so I only have one.  Your a financial advisor and you have a department store credit card?  Never hiring you lol. 
Can't replace multiple banks cards in one trip no. I may have to walk 10 minutes. Point is they can be replaced. If you lose / have your backups  and password stolen yours can't be replaced. 
It's clearly easier to type into a phone then walk to a bank but I'll put up with that walk if it means I can be confident that my life savings won't disappear if I do somehow simple like loose a Password and backups. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 01:03:07
That's not actually true. Please read the tread again and notice all the people I've responded to and asked further questions. Again you do see the irony of calling someone a troll while currently trolling their account right. That is a true story about hearing about it at 1200 again if it makes you feel better about your small life to assume people on the internet asking honest questions are "R3" trolls you do that but please seek a  mental health professionals because You clearly have some deep issues. 
@_date: 2016-08-01 22:18:28

@_date: 2016-08-04 05:55:37
Wait a minute. Just flipping through your comment"
"Right now, due to a series of unfortunate events, my monthly expenses are about $300 more than my monthly income. Every month I have to dip into my savings just to survive. I'm racking up credit card debt and eating one meal a day. I can probably survive for another 4 -5 months at this rate. After that, idk what I'm going to do.  
If a billionaire sent me a Bitcoin it wouldn't get me out of my financial hardship necessarily, however it would keep me afloat for another 30 days. Giving me an extra 30 days to find another job or at least a part time one." 
Yea doesn't sound like I should be taking financial advice from you lol. Good luck finding that part time job though. 
And you sellMutual  funds?  So you do sales is what you're saying. Ha yea I've known a few people who took that 4 week course too. No wonder you kept saying "I work in finance" with out saying what you actually do even after me asking. 
Peace homie. Sell sell sell
@_date: 2016-08-04 04:34:32
If you lose your cash your shit out of luck yes but most people don't keep any serious amount of money in cash.  They keep it in a insured bank. Not having access to my saving if I lose something Or have it stolen isn't a safe way to store money. 
Sorry for the typos. On my phone and not proof reading. 
Yes I know you work in finance, you've mentioned it several times (without mentioning what you actually do mind you). I'm sure you see situations everyday where Bitcoin could help but most people don't work in finance. 
Trolls are often polite?  First would you prefer I was an asshole then?  I don't get it?  You assume someone who doesn't see the benefit in what your talking about is a troll?  Seems like you're dodging the issue. 
I responded to every one of your points and most points on this thread on why I don't think there's a benefit. If you're wondering why I've seen a single benefit to the average consumer after all these comments you can go back and read my responses there. 
I didn't say instant global transfer of wealth wasn't a benefit. I said it not a typical regular concern of the average consumer.  
@_date: 2016-08-01 23:51:31

@_date: 2016-08-02 06:26:14
Cash isn't really a concern though. I almost never carry cash.  Those valuables are kinda irrelevant since we're talking about Bitcoin as a currency for someone to use. Your moms Jewelry isn't currency (I know technically anything but you know what I mean).  
Couldn't that theoretical person check there account to see if there's money's there?  But again cash isn't really a huge concern of mine. 
Average consumer doesn't need to move currency globally.

@_date: 2016-08-04 02:38:02
Well not really. I haven't carried cash in a long time and on the rare occasion I do it's a very small amount. If I were to loose my credit or debit card I'd call the bank and have any charges that were incurred reversed, which I have done in the past. And if my bank were robbed we got the CDIC up here in Canada that insures your deposits. So if my bank is robbed My deposits are insured up to 100 000, if they're in a Bitcoin exchange they're just gone. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:49:40
Isn't that kind of an advantage of traditional banking over Bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-08-02 00:41:47
No that's true actually. It was around Christmas that year and it plummeted a few months later. Again though if it makes you feel better about your life to tell yourself I'm a "R3" troll you go right ahead and do that. I may suggest you seek a mental health professional though. Accusing someone of trolling while commenting multiple times of everything they've posted is fucking nuts. You're clearly projecting your deep seeded issues onto me and this discussion. I hope you get the help you need before it's to late.

But, correct me if I'm wrong,  haven't there been a lot of hacked Bitcoin accounts and locked up accounts.  I've actually had someone clown my credit card somehow and use it, it was caught by the banking software and they called immediately to see if it was actually me and removed the charges when it was clear it wasn't. If that was if someone had gotten Bitcoin password (sorry kind of a nood) would I just be shit out of luck. The transactions couldn't be reversed at all right?
@_date: 2016-08-01 23:30:10
I heard that 5 years ago. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 00:57:22
Thanks you for you're mature and thought out response. 
1) in your first case I'm a little confused. How does Bitcoin help there. My thinking that is the consumer won't be willing to pay unless your an established comedian in which case you have to go to ads.  That and yea YouTube adds are annoying but most people aren't willing to pay to have them removed I don't think. They already has a service that offers that right now although I'm not sure how much it is. 
2)  Steam does take a cut but isn't there an advantage to being on their system and catalog (full disclosure I'm not a steam user so I'm guessing here)?   For most people wouldn't it be easier to get discovered there then on your own spot. Again if your an established game developer it's a different story but were talking Indies here. 
3). Does Bitcoin actually hold any advantage over a debit/credit card with NFC in that situation though?  It's not really hard to secure a NFC station these days.  Edit: not sure if you guys have NFC bank and credit cards where your at but we've had them here for years now.  How would Bitcoin be better than tapping my debit card and how would NFC work with Bitcoin?
Oh I'm not arguing that the blockchain technology isn't innovative and going to be important behind the scenes going forward. I just don't get why an average person would benefit from Bitcoin.

Truth hurt?  What do you expect when you stock someone on Reddit. You clearly have a life that doesn't matter and are trying to make yourself feel less worthless. 
What basic concepts. Again I was asking about usefulness of Bitcoin for a consumer because I can't see it and after being on here tonight I still don't see it. you've claimed im some "R3" spy sent here to bring down bitcoin by asking a question and you're gonna stop me. You're absolutely fucking crazy. Yo need to be medicated and treated by a professional. Please follow the links I've provided you before you hurt someone other than yourself, because you don't matter.

None of this tells me, an average consumer,  why I would want to use Bitcoin vs the US dollar. 
1). It's great that it's a new an exciting technology by why should the average mom in America switch?  
2). Instant transaction?  From what I've heard the wait can be quite long for Bitcoin transaction to go through.  Waiting for business hours went away with online banking years ago. Again not a concern. 
3) has nothing to do with the question asked.
