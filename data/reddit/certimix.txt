Where did you get that "he must have entered the hospital for his final stay around April, 2010" ?
Isn't that private information?

So it's an imprecise figure.
Thanks.

Interesting note regarding Gregory Maxwell ideas. Can you post the link to the discussion thread?
My preliminary analysis is that any irreversible computation that flips approximately the same number of memory bits consumes approximately the same. Functions that continuously replaces previous values in memory with pseudo-random words, such as the computations performed by scrypt or RandMemoHash or Bitcoin sha-256, will consume the approximately equal, and a lot more power than any "search" based PoW or hash function (such as Coocko Cycles). 
I known no evidence than xor-ing, shifting, or adding requires less power than, say, multiplying, in CPUs. RAM memory writes consumption should be weighted against raw computations on registers, but I guess the consumption factor is not above 1:5.
But since the speedup for doing non sequential computations could be as high 2K:1 in an ASIC, this is the first variable one must tackle. So, if you aim is to prevent the use of ASICs, then both scrypt or RandMemoHash should do, even if one consumes ten times the power of the other.

Also another possibility is fix  is by creating a puzzle so that miners need to prove they have a local copy of the block-chain itself, as permacoin can do. Then there will be very incentive to use pools, since each miner would be almost like a normal node...

It's disgusting to see these journalist tactics to destroy this man's privacy. I hope he is not the Bitcoin's Satoshi. I still think he's not. And I hope nobody is hurt because of this. It was never my intention to uncover Satoshi and the research I did, I did it to decide whether I should invest in Bitcoin or not.

Solving  is easy: use a 5-seconds block interval. Then the granularity is 120 times higher. Nimblecoin.org does it. But requires a hard-fork.
@_date: 2015-05-05 21:34:54
I would like to add that rising the block size is not the only possible immediate solution (nor the best). Decreasing the block interval rate to 1 minute is the best technical solution. Orphan rate can be easily kept at the current rate by several known and simple protocol solutions. It will not hurt mining pools if latency is optimized. It has the additional benefit of reducing the payment time (or in other words, increasing the granularity of a secure confirmation). 
Since everyone is posting about it now (not to mention innumerable past posts), I’ll do a new post on this subject soon.
I researched on this long ago, and I was able to put down block interval time to 5 seconds (see  Probably Bitcoin can't go that low, because going that low requires replacing the current block subsidy structure for a shared-subsidy using the DECOR+ protocol. But at least it can go safely to 1 minute, keeping the 1 megabyte block size.

It was unexpected for us that people caught attention of the recently created website while we were still in stealth mode. We don't need funding nor donations. 
Please be patient until we show our open source code to the world!
Thanks, Sergio Lerner.

The idea of approximate adders exist in the literature. AFAIK approximate adders try to exploit the fact that lower significant bits are generally less important than higher significant bits, so they make approximations adding the lsbs, but not the msbs. The idea of an approximate adder that reduces the propagation of the carry is, AFAIK, completely novel. It should be, since random looking numbers whose lsbs and msbs are equally important can only appear in cryptography. Within the cryptography field, approximate adders can only appear in hashing or cracking, since neither encryption nor signing can be made approximate without making the scheme useless or vulnerable. And within hashing, an approximate addition can only be useful if there is a trial and error procedure, such as cracking passwords or Bitcoin mining. To summarize, I'm 99% sure that carry reduced addition is a novel idea (at least in literature, maybe other people have thought about it before, but not published it).

I've not do it. It would be really cool (and easy) to perform such analysis. It can also be used to tell if hashers are being overclocked or under-powered (and so long carry propagations are leading to errors). It would be really interesting to find information in such  strange side-channel!

Also each Firmcoin carries a private-key that can be used to authenticate the device (but obviously this is worthless if the device is physically compromised!).
@_date: 2013-06-15 20:00:07
You can redeem the funds and reload funds at any later time. Also a Firmcoin is much more durable than a paper wallet.

I audited a preliminary version of protocol 2 (the tech paper, not the source), and It seems ok.

He have a database of high quality images of every Firmcoin manufactured, and we provide a lower quality database for off-line usage. Just take a photo of the Firmcoin and verify its physical authenticity.

From the "paper":
"The Bitcoin community believes [9] that the vast majority of the early mining operations were carried out by Satoshi Nakamoto, and that during this early period he accumulated about one million bitcoins (..) by mining most of the first 20,000 blocks. "
[9] Lerner S. D.: The Well Deserved Fortune of Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin creator, Vi-sionary and Genius, Bitslog, 17 april 2013,
This is totally misleading! 
From my a post just a few days after that: 
"Another interesting fact is that the pattern starts just after the genesis block, in block 1. ...It seems that block 12 is the first mined by another user."
So two hours after the true Bitcoin genesis block was released, there were other people mining. And other early miners during 2009 accumulated more than 300K bitcoins.
The conclusion of the paper is completely flawed.

More evidence that blocks at height 320, 357 , 509, 407, 541, 666 are not Satoshi's 
@_date: 2013-06-14 18:25:20
The e-paper is an excellent idea. That's was our first idea. The only drawback is that we found it a bit expensive right now. Maybe if a few months that changes. Do you have a cheap e-paper component in mind?

The Firmcoin has two capacitive buttons. You have to press only one to redeem the private key. If you press both, then the private key cannot be retrieved for a few seconds.
