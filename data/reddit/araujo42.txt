Government should not manipulate the economy.
I saw on one of your answers that banks invest my money, but in reality they actually invest like 20x that nowadays...or something, right?
I think bitcoin is going to change our consumption culture.

Miners need that type of hedge, right? Cool.
@_date: 2019-08-20 00:48:47

What are your objetives with bitcoin? 
House? Retirement?

What happens in a situation where i have 3 houses on different countries and live 4 mouths per year on each?
@_date: 2019-02-19 18:46:47
I disagree that send/receive/transaction works pretty good right now because my country (alike many other i think) has a bunch of rules/tax when i purchase something overseas that cost me time and money.
Yes, i need credit card, a big part of e-commerce still need it too.

But now they do have a deadline, we will see.

I heard that bank experience on EUA isn't good, maybe that explain your comment.
But my experience on Brazil is realy different, that so many options here that is 100% digital and most of them are highly intuitive.search (nubank, picpay or even other options here)
I know that cryptocurrency is the future, but u cannot say the UX of cryptocurrency apps are good just because your options avalible right now are trash.
@_date: 2019-02-19 16:52:09
I agree, that one of the major benefy of Bitcoin, but thats dosent change the fact thats cryptocurrency UX are not good.

What is the correlation between anti-brexit and ant-democracy, the citizens there didnt vote for it and elected a man that promisse that?

Iam a ledger user.
I use my pin to make transaction, i will only use my 24 word passphrase when i lost or change my cold wallet.
@_date: 2019-12-16 04:02:58
The majority of fiat is already digital, do you think they will just include "crypto-dollar" like Venezuela did?
Blockchain on a centralized system? Why?
@_date: 2019-12-14 22:56:20
Like they did with drugs and intelectual property (piracy), right?
@_date: 2019-02-19 18:30:46
I plan to travel and i would love to know how much bitcoin/sat per bitcoin/sat i have to pay to withdraw them as dollars.
@_date: 2019-12-13 04:31:07
Iam not USA citizen.
You dont have to report your funds or your wallet to the government yet, right? 
How would they track/tax ppl exchanging BTC to products/services? And ppl exchaging BTC to gift cards on sites without kyc and then using them? And p2p ?
@_date: 2019-04-21 00:00:50
Thats what some ppl call as "smart contract".

Can i withdraw 0,1 bitcoin in usd cash in one of those atm without any sort of id (as an tourist for example)?
There is some site that i can simulate that withdraw?
@_date: 2019-09-10 03:28:59
Probably that coin already exist.
Do you really think bitcoin is about technology? The social part i what really matter.
Software can and will change, bitcoin is really diferent than 10y ago.
@_date: 2019-09-22 13:17:54
Long term, yes. 
Short term, definitely the opposite.
@_date: 2019-05-24 02:02:04
I trade my time for fiat than trade everyy i can into bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-18 02:17:29
I do have a HW and i only know my 24 word's, if i lost my HW iam fkd???

@_date: 2018-12-08 13:47:26
Ok, lets suppose that the whole Bitcoin was minned and all of them are on the LN, what would minners do?
51% attack?
@_date: 2019-05-23 21:09:21
I would say that bitcoin is everything you want it to be. (Collection, currency, valuation reserve, investment etc)
@_date: 2018-12-08 16:54:48
Since all the Bitcoin are on LN, why would i have problem transfering a very large amount of Bitcoin there?
Is transfer fee on chain kinda flat and LN depends direct on amount(%) ?
So transfering high amount of Bitcoin on chain became cheaper but take more time to process?
