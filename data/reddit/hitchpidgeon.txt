I'm a working class father of 2 and a homeowner... this sounds like an untrue claim. Can you provide a source or explanation?

What about people who can't earn money? Or can't hold a job because of emotional problems or addiction? Or can't get a job bc they are an ex felon or an unregistered immigrant? Money is useless unless you can use it to harness the efforts of other people? Bet you are fun to hang out with.

By "Grassroots/astroturfing. I get it" I meant now I  understand the connection between the words. Like astroturf is fake grass(roots). But yeah I see how my title was confusing.

Grassroots/astroturf. Got it. Nope, I'm just a guy who posted a photo of my menu board.

What's astroturfing mean? 
This is the menu board for a popup brunch my wife and I have monthly at a bar near our house. I had 3 convos with customers about BTC today. The people who haven't heard of btc don't mention it. The ones who know about btc get nerdy and want to talk abt it. We started adding B to the payment options 4 months ago. This is the first brunch anybody commented.

Wealth is having more than other people. Money or assets. Poverty is not having access to the things you need because you don't have enough money. Wealth creation due to inflation or asset and cash accumulation creates an imbalance of power and access. As that imbalance grows, poverty increases. 
I agree with your third statement, that if you have everything you need, what's the difference? I'm ok with wealth, as long as we provide for the needs of humanity. There is room for both, but not in the free market.

Triggered. Veiled insult. It's no mystery why there is poverty. The mystery is that while we have the technology to provide the basics to all humans, we choose not to do so.

Interesting you mention health care... only for people who can afford it? 
You are quick with the insults, is all I meant. If your arguments are reasonable, let them stand alone.

The only ingredients we bought were eggs, bacon and yogurt. Everything else made from scratch.

Newb here, but seems like mycelium will let us do that... but I really just want people to get used to seeing BTC everywhere. Thing is, nobody has even mentioned it! I would probs give a discount just for someone showing interest.

God my brother and my dad. They are three but really one. It's complicated.
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:14:17
See? I replied to the original post instead of your comment!

Got it. Whew.

With money like that he could reorganize society. Better Nakamoto than a Koch or a Clinton.
