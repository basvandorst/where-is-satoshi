I wish i know how. Leave me totally at blank spot to think about it.
@_date: 2019-10-04 19:08:04
Yes. I very confident with the safety of my passphrase and seeds.

Just for the record and info.
Regarding updating to latest firmware by Trezor for TREZOR One which is 1.8.3..there is 2 main step..
They release a Bitcoin-Only supported for the latest firmware but its an option...but the thing is, the way to update is kind of different from previous update.
First of all, when u connected your device and update firmware notification appears..and u will follow those steps like previous firmware updates.
but the thing is, after update, u will be required to do extra step to get the Bitcoin-Only firmware and this might be the problem is.
Like i said,  i just update to 1.8.3 and i didnt proceed with the Bitcoin-Only firmware. And then this happen to me.
More info can refer here: 
@_date: 2019-10-05 15:29:26
Which device u have mate? One or T? Until which steps u update your firmware? Only via web update or u finish those steps until u did the /custom_firmwares for Bitcoin-Only too?
@_date: 2019-10-05 01:30:10
@_date: 2019-10-04 15:07:48
Updating TREZOR wallet just required u to connect your device while holding the 2 buttons (for TREZOR One) to enter bootloader mode and then the TREZOR web will uploading new firmware and update your device and then u will be ask to reconnect. All is done via TREZOR website.
@_date: 2019-10-05 16:42:56
Selfish? Not sure how u interpret and understand my comments. 
If theres anyone else who experience the same thing, then i guess it will be good to discuss and get to the bottom of this. Of course losing BTC is not something anyone especially those who really care about their BTC and use hardware wallet to make sure its totally safe. 
But well its up to u on how u wanna think about my comments. if i say something wrong and might cause confusion or hatred in your heart. then am sorry. 
by the way, english it not the main language in my country. so might be the way i write my english is bad though.
@_date: 2019-10-04 16:38:32
Ok sure thanks mate for the good suggestion.

last transaction before it was hacked and BTC was stolen, it did show that is the bitcoin change address.
@_date: 2019-10-04 15:22:49
From TREZOR official website. Never trust 3rd party even they said its unopened.
@_date: 2019-10-07 11:16:27
This is the address when i ping trezor.io
@_date: 2019-10-04 21:59:59
I wish i can assume all that but i just cannot because its impossible.
@_date: 2019-10-04 21:00:48
How can anyone seen my seed? Thats the question am seeking for..because its written on paper not in any device which connected to internet. i never done that. and that paper contain my seed was keep inside my safebox since day 1. and no one can access my safebox. not even my wife.
@_date: 2019-10-04 15:22:13
Should be. This is not the first time am updating my Trezor. Everytime theres is an update, it will appear on top of the wallet interface after u enter Pincode and access your wallet.
@_date: 2019-10-04 19:47:33
Thats what i believe 2 years ago..and i still believe it until now.
@_date: 2019-10-04 21:52:52
Its generated during the 1st initial setup when i received it...it was over 2 years ago and i wrote it myself on the papers that came together with the device package.
@_date: 2019-10-04 15:55:39
Sure will do.
@_date: 2019-10-04 19:01:21
Yes true. The last transaction is not done by me. And it was done during my sleeping hours. 
Is it the only way someone can access my wallet just by having my seed with them? because seed is 100% safe with me..never been enter to any website or use for wallet recovery.
@_date: 2019-10-04 19:31:17
Am posting on Reddit asking if anyone have same experience. I really want to how how this could happen. Or am i the only one experience this out of several thousand of TREZOR user?
@_date: 2019-10-04 15:05:54
Not sure. I dont even know that wallet can be trace by IP as my understanding that blockchain do not store IP address. But that it was i get from the web bitcoinwhoswho (dot) com when i enter that address. It shows everything including transactions and IP Address, most probably location of the BTC wallet address. No so sure.
@_date: 2019-10-04 20:58:07
it was over 2 yrs ago and i wrote it down on paper where there is no webcam or any camera nearby.
Am a person who is very concern about security of my BTC and i have read, follow and take all the necessary action which is related to the safety of my BTC wallet.
@_date: 2019-10-04 20:53:04
@_date: 2019-10-05 16:56:28
Its from Trezor. 
Chrome extension for TREZOR Version 1.2.7
Exchange data with the device named 127.0.0.1
Access any of these USB devices
Bitcoin Wallet [TREZOR] from SatoshiLabs
unknown devices from InterBiometrics
Communicate with cooperating websites
@_date: 2019-10-04 21:27:52
So this might be the reason?
@_date: 2019-10-04 18:33:22
If u are referring that 'He' is me, then u r wrong. Updating TREZOR firmware never required to enter seed unless wanna do wallet recovery and if u are saying about the first time i receive the TREZOR, it was over 2yrs ago..and seed was on paper physically. And i never use those seed because i never recovery my wallet before this happen.
@_date: 2019-10-05 16:25:15
Yes if u have Trezor Bridge Extension installed for Chrome, a popup will appear top right corner when u connected your device.
@_date: 2019-10-06 16:52:45
Trace my BTC and seems now it is at this address and looks like lotsa small amount of BTC have been transfer to this address in 1 day.
Origin address is [ where my BTC was transfer from my wallet without my knowledge.
@_date: 2019-10-04 20:10:14
Which part u r saying am changing my story? I just dont get it.
@_date: 2019-10-04 16:53:30
I dont mind if they ask too. But they just emailed me and ask for XPubs and i already send to them. Let see what can they find out with what happened to my BTC wallet.
@_date: 2019-10-04 19:46:52
Please i hope u can spend some time to read all my replies.
@_date: 2019-10-04 21:29:01
I need other reason because phishing site not an option because i never enter it anywhere and there is no possible leaked.
@_date: 2019-10-04 16:27:04
thats the thing, ive been checking it too. That chrome extension is from TREZOR not from 3rd party developer. Its still under TREZOR securities. Suppose.
@_date: 2019-10-04 18:25:05
Yeah me too. Losing my BTC is 1 thing..but the other thing, when someone able to access my TREZOR wallet and stole my BTC..thats security measure about TREZOR.
@_date: 2019-10-04 16:24:42
Yeah..i know. I have been taking care all securities measure and this happened. Really make me shocked.
@_date: 2019-10-12 08:49:17
If theres anyway can prove this...then this might be the reason my TREZOR wallet been access by unknown and BTC gone.
@_date: 2019-10-04 15:00:04
Yeah never happen to me before i always believe it safe to keep my BTC on TREZOR hardware wallet and this thing happened really make me shocked. I have 3 TREZOR by the way...2 unit TREZOR One and 1 unit TREZOR Model-T. Now wondering if all of them are still safe to use.
@_date: 2019-10-07 11:55:44
Yes mate.
@_date: 2019-10-04 15:41:31
MY 1st concern is the safety of using TREZOR. Ive been using it for over 2yrs now and never experience this. And i have more than 1 TREZOR where i use to keep my BTC.
@_date: 2019-10-04 19:31:35
Am posting on Reddit asking if anyone have same experience. I really want to know how this could happen. Or am i the only one experience this out of several thousand of TREZOR user?
@_date: 2019-10-04 20:51:32
Am not really sure about this firmware updates..its kind of different from TREZOR this time...because it says its Bitcoin-Only and when u update thru web, those altcoins still appear and then u need to make few other step to continue the update. 
i think u can read it here. But me, i just did the update thru web wallet. which is until step no.2
Check it here: 
@_date: 2019-10-04 14:37:21
Already did even i already contact their support but no respond. Too bad ive been using and trusting them for over 2yrs now. sigh...
@_date: 2019-10-04 21:56:50
hardware access is impossible. i can guarantee that. the only possible way is software access. pin and passphrase is memorisable, they only can get it if they can extract my brain or access my memory..seed are on paper never on any device and was kept safe in safebox.
@_date: 2019-10-04 21:39:57
I wish i can show you my transaction or is there anyway i can show it without need to screen capture and send it here?
5.63 BTC was received at 23.35AM and after confirmations, i made 1 BTC and 2 BTC payment both at almost same time exactly at 23.44AM. So that is around 9 minutes after i received 5.63BTC.
0.4 BTC was made at 00.45 AM which is around 1 hours after that. 
Then device was disconnected and i went to sleep.
Device was connected again at 21.22 PM the next day to make another BTC payment and i found out my BTC balance was 0 BTC and i saw last transaction was at 9.30 AM which is during my sleeping hours. Total balance was sent out and its not done by me.
I do want to get to the bottom of this and find out how can someone access my wallet and make the transfer.
There is no way anyone can know my seed or PIN or have access to my device. Its impossible. And i dont know how else to say this, its impossible.
The thing that i know and for sure is i did the firmware update before i receive that 5.63 BTC because the last transaction i did before that was on 29 August 2019  for the amount 0.22 BTC and with balance remaining 0.00599957 BTC and also that the date where i last connected my TREZOR device to my iMac to access my wallet.

Reply from TREZOR Support Team, just now
Thank you for getting back to me.  
 I wholeheartedly recommend you contact the authorities (if you haven't already) and report a theft.  
There are basically 2 scenarios of what could have happened:  
1) Either some 3rd person did use your Trezor physically for confirming the transaction  
or  
2) Your private keys (represented by your recovery seed) were compromised and the attacker did use them to sign the transaction. This is possible since you can recover your wallet including your private keys by performing a recovery to a compatible wallet.  
Unfortunately, we cannot say what exactly happened, since as I've mentioned earlier, we hold no control over your accounts, assets or access details, we do not track the activity on your account as well. Such information is not available from the blockchain as well, it only shows the transaction details such as the amount, destination and the time when the transaction was mined.  
Please let me express our sympathy, we're very sorry about this.  
Let me know if there's anything else we should cover or explain, we are ready to provide you with the necessary support.
@_date: 2019-10-04 14:58:15
Thats what confusing me because there is no way anyone who can guess or have my PIN+passphrase or have access to my mnemonic seed+passphrase. I always concern about all this security measure to keep my BTC safe.
@_date: 2019-10-04 16:29:45
Like i mentioned, this happened after i update firmware to the latest one for TREZOR One which is version 1.8.3. 
It just released by TREZOR and kind of unique update because its for Bitcoin-Only and they eliminate altcoins.
@_date: 2019-10-04 16:26:01
No its ok for asking. 
My wife have no idea what is BTC or cryptocurrency and no she never bring anyone into the house. She is fulltime housewife.

Theres is no word need to be enter when using TREZOR. Only PINCODE.
@_date: 2019-10-04 18:20:06
There no way to get a copy, updates is done thru web. When u connected TREZOR on bootloader mode, latest firmware will be uploaded from their server to your TREZOR device and then u will be ask to reconnect after done installing new firmware.
@_date: 2019-10-04 19:46:42

Am using chrome and when i connect my TREZOR, notification will appear and when i click it, will open web brower which is  And then option to select either my device is Trezor One or Trezor Model T.
When i click my device which is Trezor One, will redirect to this web  id&gt;/account/0 and asking for Pincode.
TREZOR have this app for chrome called Trezor Bridge
@_date: 2019-10-04 20:55:10
Thats what i believe but what happen it totally other side. I want to say the same but the thing is there is no one.
@_date: 2019-10-07 11:04:40
1st received the package from TREZOR, it comes with 2 pieces of blank paper where i wrote those seed myself. I only use 1 paper out of 2 that i received. The other still blank and never been use. And both papers in my safebox since then.
@_date: 2019-10-05 00:59:01
Seed have been written on paper since day 1 and it was over 2yrs ago. Ive been keeping it safe with no one have access to it and i never use it or enter it in any website before. And also i never recover my wallet before this happen.
@_date: 2019-10-04 14:38:55
Ok sure will do. Thanks mate
@_date: 2019-10-05 18:58:44
Ok thanks mate.
@_date: 2019-10-07 11:01:21
I received reply from Trezor Support Team today. Here is what they asked and my reply to them.
Thanks for the update.  
Unfortunately, it seems that there has been a transaction made out of your wallet without your authorization. This is the transaction in question:
[  
If this is correct and you were not the one to sign this transaction, then there are basically 2 scenarios of what could have happened, since each transaction must be signed by using private keys of the respective address.  
1) Either some 3rd person did use your Trezor physically for confirming the transaction  
or  
2) Your private keys (represented by your recovery seed) were compromised and the attacker did use them to sign the transaction. This is possible since you can recover your wallet including your private keys by performing a recovery to a compatible wallet. Please, see our user manual to learn more about the recovery seed and recovery process:  
[  
[  
Now I need to ask you a few questions that could help us figure out what happened in your case:  
Regarding point no.1:  
• Are there multiple individuals with physical access to your Trezor device?  
• Are the multiple individuals with a knowledge of your PIN and passphrase (if used)?  
Regarding point no.2:  
• Are there multiple individuals with access to your recovery seed words?  
• Was the recovery seed ever entered into some 3rd party app/wallet or claiming tool for example?  
• Did you, at any point, search for Trezor Wallet (or just Trezor) using Google or any other search engine in order to access your funds? Furthermore, and this is crucial;  
• Have you ever entered your seed to a form as pictured in the following article: [  
• Do you keep the recovery seed in physical or digital form?  
• Do you use passphrase protection?  
Please get back to me with your feedback.
My reply to them.
Hello there,
Regarding point no.1:  
• Are there multiple individuals with physical access to your Trezor device?
\- NO, Only me.
  
• Are the multiple individuals with a knowledge of your PIN and passphrase (if used)?
\- NO, Only me and its never written only in my head.  
Regarding point no.2:
• Are there multiple individuals with access to your recovery seed words?
\- NO, Only me.
  
• Was the recovery seed ever entered into some 3rd party app/wallet or claiming tool for example?
\- NO, Never.
  
• Did you, at any point, search for Trezor Wallet (or just Trezor) using Google or any other search engine in order to access your funds? Furthermore, and this is crucial;
\- NO, Never.
  
• Have you ever entered your seed to a form as pictured in the following article: [
\- NO, Never.
  
• Do you keep the recovery seed in physical or digital form?
\- In physical from. I wrote it myself on the paper that comes with the package when i 1st did the initial setup over 2yrs ago.
  
• Do you use passphrase protection?
\- Sadly NO for this wallet.
@_date: 2019-10-07 12:02:05
None at this moment. I use this extension long time before but never uninstalled. Maybe its my bad.
@_date: 2019-10-05 18:41:41
Thanks mate but can be more specific on how to do that.
@_date: 2019-10-04 18:43:58
How is that possible? Do you have TREZOR or ever update your TREZOR firmware?
Its all done via TREZOR's web. And if u want to say the url is wrong website, then you are wrong..this is not my first time updating my TREZOR and checking url have became my habit because we are talking about safety of BTC here.
@_date: 2019-10-04 17:41:34
I already move all my BTC from this TREZOR and also from the other 2 TREZOR that i have to new wallet. Don't think i should gamble this after what had happened.
@_date: 2019-10-04 20:20:00
Urgh..what is wrong by writing TREZOR or Trezor..their logo is all capital letter so i am just feel it a good way to write like that.
Am not sure what i have missing. Since my 1st post i have tell everything and try to answer all comments cause i hope it will helps to find what cause all this. Not sure what else i should say. 
Please guys, please dont even think this is just a story or just to create FUD. I posting about what i have experience yesterday...and what happen to my TREZOR or Trezor..and am trying to find anyone who have same experience and how it this possible to happen. 
Some of you might be TREZOR owner too..so you should know how is its security level and none that happen to me should not happen but it did happen so i want to know how it is possible...
And dont ask about securities measure from user side as my side, all have been taking care of...how should i say this...its been taking care of since the 1st day i receive my TREZOR..ive been reading about BTC got hack too..ive been studying about its safety and how to keep it safe..that why at the first place i bought TREZOR..back then am using KeepKey before i choose to use TREZOR. So i hope no question about securities measure that ive taken to keep my BTC safe.
@_date: 2019-10-04 18:36:08
I sent email to support after i found my TREZOR was access by someone and BTC was stolen yesterday and they just replied few minutes after i create this thread.
They asking for web browser history and XPubs. I already sent to them and waiting for them to check what is going on and how did this happen.
@_date: 2019-10-12 08:54:22
They dont admit it and i guess they will never admit it even what had happened to me is just right after i do the firmware updates from them. And it seems no one is having the same issue. 
What is the % of TREZOR user that receive BTC right after they do the firmware updates? And then they make payout and leave the balance in their TREZOR wallet and believe that its safe like usual and then they found out the next day, wallet accessed by unknown, balance was 0 and BTC was gone.
@_date: 2019-10-04 17:09:21
The only thing i know is ive been using TREZOR for over 2yrs and have done lots of transaction and nothing ever happen. And am taking care of all the securities measurement because i kept most of my BTC in my TREZOR.
This thing only happened to me after the lastest firmware updates. And am totally shocked and cant believe what had happened because all this while i have full faith on TREZOR and also i never heard any TREZOR been hacked before.
@_date: 2019-10-04 19:04:01
Am sorry if u think and feel that i discredit TREZOR. 
Ive been using TREZOR for over 2 yrs. my 1st transaction on my TREZOR was September 2017. And all this while, TREZOR is where i kept my BTC, receive and make payment using BTC. 
I trust TREZOR and have faith with their product. But then this thing happen and make me shocked. Try getting your BTC wallet suddenly got 0 BTC and u found out your last transaction is not done by u then u will understand my situation.
@_date: 2019-10-06 04:28:46
Thanks. U made it very clear on the facts. so i hope non will ask same question again.
Regarding scenario,
1. yeah people forgot but what i clearly remember, it was written 2 years ago and no one is there at that moment only me and it was kept safe right after that. In a safebox yes.
2. This is what am really concern actually not sure if thats the cause or its justr coincidence but am sure if i dont make that 3 transaction after i received 5.63 BTC after the firmware update, i will lost it all.
3. Keylogger or MiTM might be the cause and i already scan my iMac using Malwarebytes and Bitdefender and found nothing. Imac is clean. Let me know if theres any software that i can use other thant this 2.
4. Might be the case too.
@_date: 2019-10-04 15:43:33
Sigh...totally no idea how this happen.
@_date: 2019-10-04 14:57:10
Nope. All steps on the browser TREZOR website. Theres no need to input seed words or anything. But i read somewhere that updating TREZOR firmware will expose xPub Keys to TREZOR itself.
@_date: 2019-10-04 15:30:06
Ah ok noted. Thanks for the info mate.
@_date: 2019-10-04 18:41:24
Am sorry, I dont get it what is wrong with u sir. Some people is asking same questions or give good comments..but yours are totally different.
@_date: 2019-10-04 22:33:37
Yes i know but i believe my safebox is completely safe.
@_date: 2019-10-04 14:07:28
I have update my TREZOR One to 1.8.3 firmware but i don't update to custom firmware for Bitcoin-only. And then I use my TREZOR like usual to receive BTC payment and also make payment.
This happen to me yesterday before i received BTC payment for 5.63BTC. When i connect my TREZOR, it asked for firmware update and i did follow those steps and successfully update my TREZOR.
Then i receive my BTC payment from sender for 5.63 BTC at 23.35PM (GMT+8) and i have a few 0.00599957 BTC in my wallet. So new balance is 5.63599957 BTC.
And after confirmations, i made 3 payments which is 1 BTC, 2 BTC both at 23.44 PM(GMT+8) and 0.4 BTC at 00.45AM (GMT+8).Then i went to sleep. My last balance is 2.23588614 BTC
And today when i woke up and want to make another payment, after connect my TREZOR, saw my BTC wallet balance was 0 BTC. And last transaction was made during my sleeping hours. it was done at 9.30AM (GMT+8). My 2.23588614 BTC (total balance) was sent to this unknown address: 1C3tZZKPj6cQ8GsFh513sPZKqE6PPVgCBY and from this address, those BTC split and sent to this 2 unknown address: 3B3HHqgC9Y8S9YgkjkmDRkFt6yd8fdRoW7 and bc1qd8astppht3ugtklmn9ldckjle8u3940c7j3hpp
At this time i write this, that both address still have my BTC.
Update: From this address bc1qd8astppht3ugtklmn9ldckjle8u3940c7j3hpp have been sent to the other address 3B3HHqgC9Y8S9YgkjkmDRkFt6yd8fdRoW7
Can monitor here: [
Am totally confused with what had happened as it never happened to me before and i kept most of my BTC in my TREZOR because i trust its securities features but then this happen and this is out of my mind.
I have my TREZOR Pin Enable and it is always with me and in my safebox when i go to sleep. And also there is no way i ever share my Private Keys to anyone.
So what should i consider this? My TREZOR got hacked?
Email to support have been done. Talk to support via Twitter have been done. Open thread at Reddit have been done but was removed by admin.
Please help me on this. what is going on with TREZOR? No longer reliable on the securities features? If anyone have same experience please let me know..
@_date: 2019-10-04 14:25:05
Ive been tracking and i found this web bitcoinwhoswho and it show ip address for the address 1C3tZZKPj6cQ8GsFh513sPZKqE6PPVgCBY which is IP: 108.199.239.172 and 88.99.170.66
@_date: 2019-10-04 15:36:07
Yes i still can see all past transaction. 
Trezor hardware wallet allows u to have as many account to keep your BTC as u want. And each account can generate wallet address as many as u want and i still can see all past transaction for the last 2 years since 1st transaction been made using this wallet.
@_date: 2019-10-04 18:54:47
Yeah i saw and realize at the first place that transaction is legit and its done from my wallet. The thing that i wonder is how is it someone able to access my TREZOR wallet after ive taking care of all those securities measure. 
The only thing i can recall is firmware updates that ive done right before i received that 5.63 BTC. 
So am asking if there is other TREZOR user who experience the same thing that happen to me. 
@_date: 2019-10-04 16:24:05
Checked and its TREZOR genuine and valid website.
@_date: 2019-10-07 14:53:53
My reply
Scenario 1
\- its impossible and I can guarantee that. No one is in the house and am living with my wife and when this happened, she is not in the country. I just send her to airport on 30th September because her flight is at 11.55AM, Monday 30th September 2019. My wallet was accessed on 9.30AM GMT+8, 3rd October 2019. And even my wife still haven’t back yet and she is still outstation and will be back by 17th October 2019.
Scenerio 2
\- That is what I want to figure out how did attacker manage to get my private keys since recovery seed it safe with me. It was written by me on that paper that comes with the package over 2yrs ago and it was kept safe in my safe box.
By the way, what is the compatible wallet that u said? Any example?
@_date: 2019-10-04 20:43:48
ok let me try to be specific and i hope its help to find how this could happen. And others, please i hope u guys read this too.
Yesterday am going to receive payment of 5.63BTC so i connect my TREZOR like usual. Once USB is connected, a popup from Trezor Bridge appear and i click it and it will open TREZOR website. I did check the url as usual too. Then i select my device and continue to wallet and enter my PIN.
Then i saw a notification on top of the screen on my wallet interface asking for firmware update. At this time i didnt know that this update is Bitcoin-Only and will eliminate other altcoins. So i just proceed with the firmware update.
I disconnect and then reconnect with 2 button push on my TREZOR One to enter bootloader mode.
Once the web recognize my device in bootloader mode, i need to tick that i have my seed with me. Then i need to confirm update on my device. And web begin uploading and install new firmware on my device. And finally i was ask to reconnect.
After reconnect, i access my wallet as usual after enter the PIN. And then i receive 5.63 BTC payment. I have few BTC before i receive this payment which is 0.00599957 BTC. Total after receive payment is 5.63599957 BTC
I made 3 payment after confirmations which is 1 BTC at first, 2 BTC on second transaction both at same time  at 23.44 AM GMT+8 and 0.40 BTC on 3rd transaction at 00.45AM GMT+8 before i disconnect and go to sleep. My TREZOR back into my safebox. 
The next day, i want to make another BTC payment and when i connect and access my BTC wallet as usual, my BTC balance was 0 and last transaction was made during my sleeping hour at 9.30AM in the morning which is at this time am still havent wake up yet. 
And after i found out this, i still cant think that my TREZOR was hacked because from what i understand, it is impossible but it really happened. so i decide to contact Support team via email, Twitter and also Facebook page and i also open threat in here, Reddit asking if anyone having same experience but most probably my acc is still new, that threat was removed. Automated msg says that my account with Reddit is too young and need to wait 1 day.
And today i repost again in both r/Bitcoin and r/TREZOR and also right after i repost, i receive email from Support Team from TREZOR and they ask from my browser history and XPub..i already replied to them and give what they ask.
So am i missing anything here? This is all happen.
Your question how did it differ from previous one, well the process is just the same, nothing out of usual or different from previous firmware update process but i can tell this is the only update that changes the numbering box on the device. i dont know how to explain it..but previously the box contain numbers for PIN..its perfectly square but after the firmware update, its not a box anymore, more like a paint swipe with number on it...i dont know how to explain it really. but its different and its obvious. For those who is using TREZOR should understand what am saying.
@_date: 2019-10-04 21:20:35
I have update to 1.8.3 for Trezor One. And during this happen, i only update until step 2 if u read in the that Trezor Blog. Current firmware version am using now yes its confirm 1.8.3
@_date: 2019-10-04 23:14:11
Was wondering, if hacker were able to initiate transaction without hardware wallet so there is probably serious break on firmware side. So most probably I have update an infected firmware? And the firmware where I update my device is already infected originally from TREZOR?
Is there any possibility iMac can be infected by Trojan and some trojan on my iMac probably changed the url to incorrect (controlled by hacker) source and I were updated from wrong source? Can Trojan could changed the url where I download the firmware right after the download begin? But am 100% sure the url is correct every time i access my wallet or do firmware updates.
@_date: 2019-10-04 18:19:00
Thats why am asking if anyone else have the same experienced. The latest firmware updates just release recently and the way to update is kind of different from previous firmware updates. 
And i also said am concern about the safety of using TREZOR because i have other unit that have been updated to the latest firmware too.
@_date: 2019-10-04 18:58:48
I did it yesterday before i received that 5.63 BTC and yes its a requirement to check the checksum and make sure its match then only the update will begin.
@_date: 2019-10-04 16:52:16
Yes there is a build in camera on my iMac..but i never expose my seed or passphrase in front of my imac. And i dont know why i should do that, seed is just for wallet recovery and i never recover my wallet before this happen.
@_date: 2019-10-05 02:26:39
I don't expect anyone to believe what am telling in fact this is digitally world anyone can be anyone but what am telling it is what happened to me and i experience it myself. Theres no point asking or begging people to believe. This is truly happened to me and i want to know why and how this could even happened. And i really hope there will be other people too who experience the same thing and rise their hand here. 
Its up to u guys to consider this a FUD, or fake or daydream story but i have no other intention except to find out what and how this could happen..this is related to security of using TREZOR and ive been using it over 2 yrs and this is not my one and only TREZOR and this kind of thing never happened to me before. For me this is serious matter and it need to be solve.
@_date: 2019-10-05 19:01:15
no i dont see prey.log in the list.
@_date: 2019-10-05 15:33:06
@_date: 2019-10-05 10:16:07
Am focus on option 2 because that the only possible way at this moment after all other securities measure was checked.
@_date: 2019-10-04 15:31:07
No chance at all. Been living with my wife and no one else in the house. And also my wife have no idea at all about BTC or cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2019-10-04 15:20:58
Am not sure. here is my wallet where i receive payment and make payment to. **3LP8G1hdV64iJLJfRtFCLjbpYwnwbwEAmv**
@_date: 2019-10-04 14:43:52
I do understand it but the things is its not me who do the transfer. Like i said, that transaction is made during my sleep and i was shocked when i want to make another transfer after i woke up..my balance was 0. Entire balance was sent out to an unknown BTC wallet address which is this 1C3tZZKPj6cQ8GsFh513sPZKqE6PPVgCBY
@_date: 2019-10-04 15:01:42
Never. I always keep my 24 seed on paper, physical not online and its always with me.
@_date: 2019-10-05 17:07:59
Ok thanks mate.
@_date: 2019-10-04 16:23:21
Just ordinary cryptocurrency user. Not a software or developer.
@_date: 2019-10-04 15:38:22
Yeah mate. Totally shocked me.
@_date: 2019-10-05 10:07:12
Not sure who are u referring to. 
But what am telling here is everything that happened. I dont know why people keep thinking that seed is not perfectly safe and been expose when the real fact it is perfectly safe with me all the time. Simply exposing to other person or website will never been done. At the first place, ive said 4-5 yrs ago am using KeepKey and then am switching to TREZOR because its more compact until now am only using TREZOR as my hardware wallet..and this have been said in my other comments..so i hope you u guys can think of that am not keeping some small amount of BTC...if i wanna do so, blockchain wallet in iOS would be good enough..hardware wallet is the best option when u come to keep lots of BTC. And thats why security is the most important thing. 
Almost every person here is asking the same question and pointing that might be me exposing my seed, pin and someone have access to my TREZOR physically...well none of this ever happen. Never happen at all. So please stop asking question related to this. Am also totally shock, weird, and hard to believe what just happened and cant think of how a person able to access my TREZOR wallet without have physical access to it, and bypass almost everything and make a transaction without my knowledge. And there is no other person near me where am staying when this happen..not in the house or the house have been broke in..no its not. This is done by someone with unknown location.
Like i said the only thing i remember before all this happened, before i receive that 5.63 BTC was i did the firmware updates, this might somehow open a window. My wallet might have been targeted like some of you think of..i cant deny that. but i want to find out how he manage to hacked into my wallet. this is what i need to focus on so might be some necessary action need to be taken other than keeping seed safe, keeping device safe, not to expose to anyone, not to simply enter it in any web. Extra precaution need to be taken other than all this.
And also, who is here did the firmware update? TREZOR One with firmware 1.8.3...i saw none...no one did? Please if u are TREZOR user and did the firmware updates, please rise your hand and let me...let us know if u experience the same thing that happened to me. Right now the only thing i saw is repeated comments and questions. Please guys do some reading before u ask. Am willing to give as much info as i can to get to the bottom of this. Just please do simply say that seed been expose or what so ever nonsense or keep asking same questions. If u cant come out with good comment that helping to solve this, then just be a reader and together we see how this thing goes..meanwhile i still haven't receive any respond from Trezor Support Team..and still waiting.
@_date: 2019-10-04 15:23:31
Yeah sure. TREZOR support just replied my email and waiting for them to find out what is happening.
@_date: 2019-10-05 16:31:02
Not sure if u quite get what am seeking for. Am a user of TREZOR for over 2 years and suddenly this happen. And am not using 1 device, but 3 in total all is TREZOR. So i hope u can understand how much i trust them and then this happen, am just want to make sure its really safe. really really safe especially with the latest firmware updates because all this happen just right after i did the update. Am also not sure if it's a coincidence or what..but that is what happened.
If theres any flaw on the firmware, only TREZOR know
If theres any possibility someone could have access to wallet thru the firmware, only TREZOR know 
But i dont see any fast respond or feedback from them and until now i still havent receive reply in my email after ive provide what they ask from me.
Maybe its not clear enough. I say it simple. I just want to make sure its really safe so i can still use it again.
@_date: 2019-10-04 19:59:55
I dont know how to say it since this keep coming out.
Seed or passphrase never been enter into TREZOR or any website. Why should i deny this if its really never been done.
To make transaction using TREZOR, just need to click confirm on the device after u check address and amount is match on the web.
@_date: 2019-10-04 19:37:54
I dont input passphrase or seed into any site. 
Am not sure what are u referring to...but updating TREZOR does not require any seed or passphrase to be enter in TREZOR web or any web.
@_date: 2019-10-04 15:11:00
Most probably. But this just happened after i update the firmware and like i said, never happened before. And i always disconnect my TREZOR from my imac after using it to make payment or receive payment.
@_date: 2019-10-04 16:50:33
True indeed. But the thing is seed is on paper physically and always safe with me...in safebox of course. And seed never been use because i never recover my wallet before it happen. Passphrase also safe with me no one ever know and i never reveal it anywhere, any website or to anyone.
In simple words, ive been taking care of all the securities measure because i use my TREZOR to keep most of my BTC and there is no way i will take it for granted.
@_date: 2019-10-04 19:07:02
Yes i confirm and need to confirm it on TREZOR device itself. Then only TREZOR web will continue with uploading and installing firmware on TREZOR device.
@_date: 2019-10-04 20:53:32
Well i hope its ok to say it here. It just numbers.
@_date: 2019-10-04 18:39:56
Yes and whats wrong with my story? I just write what happened. Is there anything else i need to tell that am missing? let me know if u need any more input. Thanks
@_date: 2019-10-04 19:52:22
Nothing i can do now. Still confused and wondering and waiting for TREZOR to respond to my email.
Not sure what to comment with what u have said but am totally sure with securities measure that ive taken.
@_date: 2019-10-04 17:01:59
Yes i always do. And by the way, am using Chrome with Trezor Bridge extension installed. So when device is connected, a popup will apprear and when click it, will open Trezor official website with all the steps need to follow to access Trezor wallet.
@_date: 2019-10-04 15:32:54
Keep in my safebox. Not in a purse or pocket or anywhere near my desktop.
By the way, when connecting the device to any pc, laptops or macs, it still require Pincode and no one ever know the Pincode too.
@_date: 2019-10-05 16:26:26
Am not sure if he want to, i dont see he his comments in this threat or in the other 2 threat but am messaging with him even just now. Not sure if he want to be mention here. i just hope if he want, he will surely reply this comment.
@_date: 2019-10-04 14:55:38
Yeah thats my receiving address. :(
@_date: 2019-10-04 17:11:10
Hmm...nice info.
@_date: 2019-10-12 08:47:50
not so much updates. replied from support also doesnt help much.
@_date: 2019-10-07 11:10:02
@_date: 2019-10-04 19:54:42
Nah not even close. I setup myself and since beginning its only me. Everything is kept and safe with me. Not sure about your location but where i live, its hard to find people who use TREZOR, the price is consider kind of expensive for most people here.
@_date: 2019-10-04 21:27:22
Yes understood. I have my passphrase same with my PIN number so its easy to remember and that might make me confuse when replying and i assume its the same.
@_date: 2019-10-04 16:59:59
The very first time is over 2yrs ago and ive been using this with hundreds transactions. 
Peeking my seed or passphrase thru camera on my imac is almost impossible.
@_date: 2019-10-05 00:41:17
Nah phishing site is not possible. Why should i lie about it.
@_date: 2019-10-05 16:33:06
Looks like u did the same like i did. Do u have any transaction made right after the update?
@_date: 2019-10-05 16:24:28
Yeah i do understand it. And am still waiting if there is anyone in the world who have same experience..please dont let me think that i am the only one.
@_date: 2019-10-05 00:54:15
Their Support did reply my 1st email that was sent to them and they asking for web browser history and XPub and i already provide that to them. Now still waiting for their next reply.
@_date: 2019-10-04 14:38:29
Yes of course. Security of my BTC is always top priority. All security measure have been taking care of. But not sure what happened. It just happened after the new update from them which is 1.8.3 for TREZOR One device.
@_date: 2019-10-04 22:07:57
Am waiting for their answer and reply too. I already replied to their email and provide what they ask for. 
Am telling them the same thing too if they ask further question. What ever am saying here is what had happened. 
I want to know the answer how is it possible to happen because this really make me shocked and confused.
@_date: 2019-10-04 20:10:39
Yeah i do. Built in camera on my iMac.
@_date: 2019-10-04 20:08:17
Actually someone asked this before.
First of all, its bookmarked because its written in TREZOR web regarding security measure so i already did it since beginning. For your info, i kept all my BTC is TREZOR, this is the only hardware wallet that i have other than BTC wallet on my iPhone just to keep few amount less than 0.1 BTC.
This is how i usually use my TREZOR, when am going to receive payment or send payment, i will connect my TREZOR to my iMac and am using Chrome browser with Trezor Bridge extension installed. So a popup will appear on top right corner and when i click it, will open TREZOR website where i need to select my device either TREZOR One or TREZOR Model-T. And yes of course each time i will check the url just to make sure its not phishing website or hacker might compromised Trezor Bridge Chrome Extension.
Then after select my device, a small popup will apprear with a video from TREZOR show and to make sure TREZOR is sealed safely for those who just received brand new TREZOR and a button there to choose to continue to wallet.
When click that button, will open my wallet and number of pin will appear on TREZOR device to show the location of the number and i need to enter it then i will be able to access my BTC wallet.
When sending out BTC payment, receiver address will appear on device and i need to check if its match and need to confirm, then goes for amount of BTC need to check its match and confirm. 
After finish using my TREZOR, i will disconnect and a popup appear either to forget or remember and i always choose to forget device.
@_date: 2019-10-05 17:06:58
U want to called all this just FUD? Well its up to u. Like i said, i only need supportive comments to get to the bottom of this. You are not helping. Thanks
@_date: 2019-10-04 17:43:28
Ah ok. So i dont think its reliable. If he/she able to hacked my TREZOR wallet, for sure he will use VPN to hide his or her IP Address.
@_date: 2019-10-04 19:24:18
Am living with my wife and theres no one else in the house. And also my wife have no idea at all what is BTC or cryptocurrency.
I just want to figure out on how someone able to access my wallet and stole all my remaining BTC in my wallet. it was done between my last transaction which is at 00.45 AM GMT+8 and the hacker sent out all my BTC at 9.30AM GMT+8.
If anyone asking about what the last thing i did to my TREZOR, last thing i did was update the firmware and that might be somehow a way for hacker to able to access my wallet thru the update or during the update or thru the firmware itself. Because i never enter seed to any website, seed and passphrase and device itself is always safe with me. Not in my palm hand, not in my pants pocket but in my safebox. Please dont ask if anyone can access my safebox because the answer is no one.
@_date: 2019-10-04 15:03:13
Sorry i dont know that it shouldnt be use for more than once. My bad.
@_date: 2019-10-05 16:36:42
1. I do have VPN Unlimited but hardly use it. i only use it for certain purpose such as to access web that have been blocked by Govt. For example: Medium.com
2. No. Only BTC.
3. No. Only on my iMac since early 2018 but this is different iMac from the one i use during the first initial setup 2 years ago. Both still with me but the other iMac cant be use and its broken. So its stay in the store room.
@_date: 2019-10-04 15:09:14
Seed words written on paper and its safe with me all the time. By the way, there is no other person in my house except my wife. And she have no idea what Bitcoin or cryptocurrency is.
@_date: 2019-10-04 15:55:06
I dont think phishing site is the cause to this because am using Chrome with installed Trezor Bridge. When connected TREZOR, a notification from Trezor Bridge for Chrome will appear on top right corner of the screen and when click it will open Trezor official website which is [ and there will be option to choose device either Trezor One or Trezor Model T before it ask for pincode to access wallet.
And i always check those url few times before i enter my device pincode.
And number for pincode will apprear on the device and u will enter it on browser according to the location of the numbers on 9 empty box on the device.
@_date: 2019-10-04 18:59:17
Its ok no problem. I understand. ;)
@_date: 2019-10-05 18:37:27
Seems like you're 100% sure with the safety of your hardware wallet, i assume u are using TREZOR too.
If yes, which model do u use and did u do the latest firmware updates and make transaction right after the update?
If not, then what else i can say. I hope, if not now, maybe someday theres something u can learn from what had happened to me.
@_date: 2019-10-04 19:28:14
What could have been taken during firmware updates? Or during the firmware update process? Seed? Passphrase? Private key? What hacker need to be able to access my TREZOR wallet and make the transfer? 
Everytime want to send out BTC payment, need to confirm on TREZOR device itself. So am totally confuse and cant stop thinking how this possible to happen.
I believe only TREZOR knows more detail about this update even if its got flaw or wormhole in the firmware updates. Am still waiting TREZOR team to check and respond.
@_date: 2019-10-04 16:54:34
What could have happen? Will be able to trace the hacker? I would like to find out who is it too if possible.
But still my concern is the safety of using my TREZOR. It really disturb me right now.
@_date: 2019-10-05 17:14:46
Which part i doesnt want to accept?
I dont think i make any mistake that compromised my seed or device. I am very sure of it. If this is what u are saying i doesnt want to accept then what else i can say. But losing my BTC, i do accept that and thats not my 1st concern other than securities of my device and BTC.
@_date: 2019-10-04 16:42:16
Yeah do some trading too on several exchanges platform.
@_date: 2019-10-04 19:46:48
Please i hope u can spend some time to read all my replies.
@_date: 2019-10-04 17:05:11
Am using the same iMac at home which i use it until now and same imac to access my wallet and do the last transaction before it was hacked and lost my BTC. 
Chrome is not safe either? Sigh..
@_date: 2019-10-04 14:54:42
@_date: 2019-10-04 21:54:04
I wrote it myself. 2 pieces of papers that comes together with the package its blank.
@_date: 2019-10-05 16:23:27
