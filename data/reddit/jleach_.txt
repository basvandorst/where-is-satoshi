I ran into an engineer a few weeks back working on a vending machine (for clients) that accepts BTC for MJ in Colorado and Washington.

You mean self driving getaway car.

This won't work. You need to wait until it is released in the Trademark Journal then file an official opposition (+ pay $750CAD).
If anyone on the forum wants to bankroll the initiative I don't mind articulating and presenting the opposition. PM me.

Secure 'em. Move them to an off-line (cold storage) wallet.

Make sure any wallet you use is *NOT* accessible by the people who run it. There was one like this several weeks ago where the system was `hacked` and everyones funds were drained.
Just because they say its secure on the website doesn't mean it is. Only you need to access your BTC. Maybe consider not keeping all your BTC in the same wallet or on-line either.

So Twitter, a company with no revenue, sells shares for $26, they jump to $48. And people ask if BTC is broken? I'd say no more broken than the stock market.

I did for software development, can't say the response has been overwhelming. But I imagine people are more interested converting BTC into Pizza rather than mobile apps. Lets see how the experiment goes in 2014.

I second the person who said don't invest anything you can't afford to loose. Having said that, I think the price has dropped quite a bit over the last week and it may be a good time to `buy the dip`, especially if you're loping long term (several years out).
Over and Out.
By the way, if you use an on-line wallet make sure that only you can access it and NOT the people who run the site. Just because it says secure on the website does not mean it is.

I'll sell you a dozen good ideas for a $1 err, that's probably 1 Satoshi right. Anyway, if you want to turn an idea into a mobile app, site, etc LMK.
I was thinking of a site that lets you donate directly to people who need it (Philippines) via BTC rather than through an organization; somehow the money we donate never ends up where its needed.

I've walked passed it a few times now and haven't seen any lineups; the first day it opened was pretty crazy.

Never regret selling and making a profit.

I think that if the US dollar hist some turbulence when QE tapering begins, say in March 2014, then gold should do quite well. There are several billion people on the planet who have never heard of BTC who will go to gold if the shit (economic) hits the fan.
BTC is a good complement to gold since you can't really use gold to do on-line transactions or send it (anywhere). Maybe think of gold as a savings account and BTC as a checking.
Perhaps we should start a gold backed crypto-currency. Anyone else in?
