I had something more like Electrum in mind. 
@_date: 2012-08-19 19:40:14
of the BTC, compound interest :) 
@_date: 2012-08-19 19:20:51
We shall see. Luckily I locked my coins with hashking at 1.9% a week untill october, I don't have to worry, I'm not trading anyway :D
@_date: 2012-10-08 10:18:58
..if he didn't loose it all with Zeek.
@_date: 2012-08-19 17:54:05
You think it's going to work?
@_date: 2012-08-25 10:19:57
Wow! You are the only one who could convince me, thanks! I might check it out now
@_date: 2012-10-10 20:59:31
Theymos what's going on with our assets? Or is Nefario a lonely cowboy?
@_date: 2012-09-10 10:47:13
Oh hello pirate!
@_date: 2012-10-10 12:00:14
mpex is bigger?
@_date: 2012-08-23 21:46:56
I'd love to check it out, however as I'm not a coder myself I can't take that risk :( 
@_date: 2012-10-12 23:05:28
LTC is going to pop
@_date: 2012-08-26 03:26:58
Damn he is ugly!
@_date: 2012-08-17 14:35:19
reddit always is so naive. I call bubble
@_date: 2012-10-11 09:54:21
That's most unfortunate, however how on earth did it come to the point where he has control over EVERYTHING related to GLBSE, from code to BTC? 
@_date: 2012-11-22 16:13:29
nah, just chill. you will have to wait, but eventually you will get the money.
@_date: 2013-03-27 22:20:08
Wouldn't 2*0.6% that mtgox takes be more than 10$? This always baffled me. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:50:36
Wanna bet?
@_date: 2013-01-23 18:44:03
lol you ain't gonna be a weed king pal
@_date: 2013-02-21 11:16:09
spot on.
@_date: 2013-02-02 10:33:33
What if BTC exchange rate drops between the time you accept the transaction and the bank transfer completes?
@_date: 2013-01-24 09:13:18
Been singing it since Pirate quit.
@_date: 2013-03-23 14:10:04
The more I read this subreddit the more I agree or at least uderstand that blog.
@_date: 2013-07-24 13:07:37
Isn't the whole purpose of bitcoin NOT to trust any 3rd party with our money? 
@_date: 2013-03-05 19:34:39
bitcoin economy lol. It aint economy if you pay taxes in flat.
@_date: 2013-07-24 15:23:35
Yeah, but I don't keep them in gox. Bank =/= exchange.
@_date: 2013-03-01 18:42:08
Whatever you do, wait for this bubble to pop!!!
@_date: 2013-01-04 08:41:30
Everything I earned got stolen.
@_date: 2013-01-22 15:11:23
But how does one determines how much $ is a bitcoin? USD exchange rate at the moment of the transaction?
@_date: 2013-02-02 15:48:11
this is a gem
@_date: 2013-07-23 22:09:56
@_date: 2013-02-02 10:36:36
I guess this is money laundering. 
@_date: 2013-02-04 14:33:19
Funny how drug agencies try to take credit for what customs did.
@_date: 2013-01-02 14:09:50
DO NOT buy any BTC shares nor coupons etc. Been there, done that. 
@_date: 2013-01-24 18:30:20
280$ isn't enough for a reddit campaign ;) ?
@_date: 2013-01-24 07:10:40
you don't like it, you jump in!
@_date: 2013-03-05 17:24:09
wait till it pops
@_date: 2013-01-22 13:33:31
How does a buisness owner explain BTC  to IRS ?
@_date: 2013-04-03 10:47:10
@_date: 2013-01-31 23:54:08
great initiative!
@_date: 2013-03-01 18:04:41
Damn it bubble, just pop already! The suspense is killing me.
@_date: 2013-04-03 07:52:24
So... it's useless.
