I bought a watch!

True but I'm only recommending it to transmit not use.
New advice, create blockchain, sweep private key, use new addresses.
@_date: 2014-01-10 05:44:30
Same here, I buy the exact amount then send. Coinbase rounding up is annoying though.
@_date: 2014-01-01 14:20:51
Blockchain is not 100% correct

@_date: 2014-01-02 12:50:13
Beware, scammer owner and they own your private keys. Use blockchain!
