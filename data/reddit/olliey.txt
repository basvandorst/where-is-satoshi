Having your medical records stolen is not a small negative side effect. It would be hard to face a victim of extortion and claim that the benefits I have experienced from bitcoin are worth his suffering. 
Equally, for gun ownership. Valuing your freedom to own a gun over the suffering of somebody that has been a victim of gun violence is a very very troubling attitude. Effective or not, gun control is a measure that attempts to reduce the number of gun related deaths. Even a small reduction is a valuable achievement. 
I feel that Bitcoiners need to acknowledge that there are legitimate reasons  for the government to limit their freedoms in order to prevent bitcoin being used to harm people. People will suffer because of the activites that bitcoin enables.

Maybe this argument makes sense from krugmans perspective. I.e. from the perspective of someone trying to design a monetary system. He wants us to use a money that encourages a type of behaviour, that is spending not hoarding. Because this is to the benefit of the economy as a whole. Good for him, but that has absolutely no bearing on our decision as investors. We are free to own whatever currency or commodities suit our purposes. 
@_date: 2017-02-09 13:51:58
They are not equivalent solutions. It is wrong to frame the discussion as a decision between two choices. 
This is not :
Shall I have chicken or fish for dinner.
Nor: 
Shall I have chicken or a hot dog that I found in the street for dinner. 
But it is : 
Shall I have chicken or some gravel for dinner.
Because segregated witness is a solution that works and bitcoin unlimited does not work.

It is being worked on at the moment. Each node could store a subset of blocks. But afaict the problem is that this could be used to identify the node. And nodes should be anon. 
If your node stores blocks 1 to 5000 for example and there are only another dozen nodes that store only these blocks then attackers can track you down to within a dozen nodes.
I don't see why the node cannot shift the pattern of blocks that it stores every so often.
 was on irc discussing the problem

I think it's entirely possible for Chinese officials to orchestrate something like this. Not for nothing is the  Chinese gov. often described as a kleptocracy. 
I lived there for 5 years and often saw similar things to this. Using the regulations as pretext. Inconsistently enforced regulation. 
A few months ago bitcoin was being promoted on Chinese state television. That can't happen without support of an insider at a high level. The market is so sensitive to any gov. pronouncements and there is no oversight on frontrunning.

Just wrong. It is implemented well. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 12:37:02
I don't see any reason for it not behaving the way that it is now. Currently 30 blocks per hour. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 12:11:46
It also means that blocks are mined at a much faster rate. ~3 days for a 2016 block cycle. So the bcash halving might happen by next year.

A lot of the blocks from unkown sources are signalling segwit. I was wondering if some large pools are testing segwit on these blocks. Is there a way to find out? 
@_date: 2016-12-07 21:49:02
How did you make the transactions ?
@_date: 2016-12-26 22:35:59
A few months ago I played around with xcp. I traded tokens in in the decentralised exchange. I must have made about 200 transactions in a week. It was fun. I think the xcp devs have not made much of a fuss about the rising cost of transactions and have focused on working around the problem, with their version of the lightning network etc. So I think it is a really good under appreciated project and I hope that it can adapt. 
The experience showed me how many transactions on the bitcoin blockchain are not so critical. So many transactions will evaporate once the fees start to rise a little. 
@_date: 2016-11-16 16:11:31
Yes. Miners mine to get the block reward. Which makes existing coins less valuable.
If 5000 dollars of electricity is spent to mine a block of 1000 transactions then each transaction costs 5 dollars. 
Holders in effect pay for 99 percent of the transaction. 
@_date: 2016-12-08 22:32:31
Also btcc have 54. There is also bitcoin knots and bitcore

I hate seeing bitcoiners say please. We shouldn't have to do that.
@_date: 2017-04-06 00:34:17
Absolutely, the long list strengthens the argument.
I would say that the empty block hypothetical is an attack because it prevents people from sending transactions and disrupts the network. Asic boost does not disrupt the network. 
If you argue that asic boost is an attack then people could reasonably argue that there are alternate solutions such as asking people to resign their patents.  Using a technical solution to solve a real world problem seems unprecedented or unique in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-04-05 22:48:25
Is it correct to characterise asicboost as an attack ?
Surely the implementation of mining hardware/software is not determined by the protocol. Setting aside the legality of patents etc, asicboost could be from now on be implemented on all machines. 
The question then comes down to should everyone have it or no-one have it. 
@_date: 2017-04-06 00:16:38
"The proof of work function can be done with less worth than it proves" 
But it still retains the same statistical properties, Poisson distribution etc. And it applies equally to all participants. It still is essentially a proof of work, or not ?
I just think that strictly speaking the basis for the argument for this bip is that it enables scaling solutions like segwit. 
@_date: 2017-04-05 23:29:23
That argument seems a little shaky to me. If back in the day someone had patented asic mining, Would you have changed bitcoins proof of work. 
The "attack" in this situation is the patent, government monopoly etc. It only has a contingent relationship to the technical details.
@_date: 2017-04-24 11:56:24
Not all of the miners signalling unlimited were using unlimited software. Possibly only bitcoin.com were using unlimited. 
@_date: 2017-04-05 22:21:59
Does the bip proposed by Maxwell break the mining equipment that runs asicboost. Or just normalise the efficiency.

How safe is it to reuse the same address to send and receive coins?
Is this what hd wallets were invented for? Why does an hd wallet seem to generate so many keys in normal everyday use. 
I am trying to find the best way to generate a 12 word passphrase. Which i can import to use in mycelium and then delete. But mycelium only had one passphrase for the whole hd structure 
@_date: 2016-10-12 00:49:13

@_date: 2016-10-24 15:44:50

Great post
@_date: 2016-10-25 12:52:56
Thank you for your answer. 
Yes I think it is not wise to use the mycelium single address feature. 
I was hoping to set up a system where I have a set of  12 word phrases each the seed of an hd wallet. Which I can import into mycelium if I need to use them. But they won't stay in mycelium. 
I really like the cold storage spending feature on mycelium. but the concept of a change address  for each transaction is confusing. I know people have lost coins because they did not back up correctly.
How does the wallet know what the structure of the hd wallet is, when just a 12 word seed is input? Does it derive it somehow from the blockchain ?
It's odd that mycelium won't let you generate a new independent hd wallet.

I don't think it has anything to do with being verifiable or not. If you know a bitcoin address you can verify the balance because it's public info. Cold wallets are more secure because the private key is not on a computer that is connected to the internet. That gives peace of mind to large investors.

I feel that Roger is winning the argument, on the show at least. Which is a shame because he is wrong imo.

It seems like the distribution of mining pools has become slightly less centralised in recent months. (Discuss fish and antpool used to account for 50 percent of blocks. Now more like 30 percent.)
Is this because transaction fees are higher? The large mining pool transactions are too expensive to pay out on pools that have thousands of miners contributing. (Also I guess that pools pay out less frequently. Meaning people are making more efficient use of the blockchain ) 
It would be interesting to analyse the dynamics of the distribution of the sizes of miners and distribution of pools. 
Would the advent of scnorr signatures and lightning network mean that that these large transactions can be simplified significantly meaning that pools can become centralised again? 
@_date: 2016-10-24 13:59:10

I disagree with the idea that it is easy to change CNY to other currencies. 
I also lived there and it was almost impossible for me as a foreigner to convert my RMB to GBP. I needed to use a Chinese friends bank account every time. 
It is possible for Chinese people to convert, but they are limited to 50,000 RMB per year (could be wrong on this). I know that there are ways to convert on the grey market but they must be very limited. I remember people hanging round outside the bank asking me if I had any Rubles to sell. 
If it was possible to change easily we would not see such big differences on the chinese and western exchanges.

Wild speculation here. 
The 4 people that have come forward (Jon Matonis, Gavin Andresen, Ian Grigg and JVP) have all made some pretty cryptic comments about this. They have not retracted their statements. They have not said that they have been tricked. 
Ian Grigg and JVP make comments about not being able to connect the real person to the keys. And seem to have a connection to this Project Promtheus. They talk about playing the long game. 
Gavin has said we should ask him again in 6 months. 
All this makes me believe that the controller of the key has revealed this fact to people in such a way that they cannot prove it to others. If that is the case then they have done it in a deliberately confusing and trickster like way.

Is the approach of the devs that if there is a hard fork then lots of changes should be bundled into one fork at the same time? Because the soft forks so far have been one change at a time which seems sensible.

People won't give you a serious answer to this question because Bitcoiners spend a large amount of time questioning their assessment of a the value of a Bitcoin.

Banks are able to lend profitably because they have access to the salary details of their account holders. They can therefore judge the risk of lending to someone better than other lenders and so on average make more. Fewer people not paying back the money. 
But If you get paid in Bitcoin. Your salary is publicly viewable on the blockchain. And so all lenders can judge your credit worthiness.

Would it be possible to encrypt, using the genesis block public key, a message containing the private key of an address containing e.g. 1 bitcoin. 
The owner of the genesis block private key could move the coin. 
So i know that somebody controls the key. But i do not know who it is. 
Would i be able to prove to others that i know that somebody controls the key. 
Sorry if there are misconceptions. 
@_date: 2016-05-10 13:32:09
