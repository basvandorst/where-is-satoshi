What I don't get is Silk Road 2 is a black market bazaar not an exchange, so why in the world are any bitcoins being held by the owners of the site?
Admittedly I've never used either SRs, but I always assumed it was just a craiglist style listing for black market goods.  You don't see many listing sites also holding the money you're planning on using, that to me screams scam from the get go.   I've been trying to read up but still haven't found any info explaining why they were holding peoples bitcoins.

One of the many reasons why mass manipulation through PR firms using the media is possible.  They want public perception to equate Mt Gox with Bitcoin, so running stories that Mt. Gox has bankrupt will make the uninformed masses believe Bitcoin has crashed.
While this one writer has done a stellar job, the disinfo being spread is still doing it's job.  Even on Pardon The Interuption today(sports talk show on ESPN), they led with a joke about how Bitcoin has crashed and asked if anyone was foolish enough to think it was real money.  It's the kind of thing that's viewed by millions, and will stick in their heads more than this article they'll never read.

I hate to break it to you, but reddit isn't "the internet".  Just because doge does well here doesn't mean it's doing better or growing faster overall.
It's a meme based coin, it's on reddit, so obviously Doge is going to do well here.

You bring up a good point while trying to belittle Bitcoin.  Imagine the even more amazing things that could of been done with Bitcoin, which already had a substantial userbase and infrastructure, if Dogecoin's userbase had backed Bitcoin instead of creating their own "from the ground up" coin to make a bunch of money?   
We could be much closer to having a mainstream cryptocurrency if reddit's userbase would of backed Bitcoin instead of making their own alt, splitting the cryptocurrency community on this site.
But hey, such fun, much wow, etc etc
@_date: 2014-02-02 22:25:00
Depends on how often it recalculates.  If it's at every X number of blocks and the number is high enough a mass exodus can effectively kill the coin.

Unless doge plans on piggybacking off the existing infrastructure and millions invested in new companies by the tech sector(hint: it can't because it's impossible), it has no chance at replacing Bitcoin.
It's far from trivial to catch up on the 5 year head start Bitcion has had, especially when the two coins don't use the same mining protocal.
@_date: 2014-02-14 16:33:10
Why were people giving their bitcoins to the website hosts though, they aren't selling the drugs they are just hosting the listings.  You don't give your money to Craig before buying something off Craigslist for example.

1.  This has been disproven many a times when it comes to Bitcoin.  The "common sense" assumption is mass hoarding will occur, however in practice many of those with Bitcoins actually spend because it's much easier to use them than it is to turn them into fiat and then by what you need, plus it grows the community.  The resent sales successes of Tigerdirect and Overstock when accepting Bitcoin show this.
2.  This is a huge downside to doge imo, because it makes it another inflationary currency.  One of the primary points of Bitcoin was to move society away from currency that will eventually be worth much less, printed into oblivion.
3.  This is the key point.  GPU miners are keeping a plethora of alt coins afloat that bring no real innovation.  They just copy/pasta the same code with a few minor changes, call it a new "clever" name ala dogecoin and have now created a new coin they can get in on at the start to get rich quick off of.
Dogecoin is just another alt, it's just reddit's alt so the posters here treat it like it's the next best thing while ignoring the innovation and actual potential to succeed Bitcoin has.
@_date: 2014-05-23 16:00:12
because it's the altcoin of reddit, without reddit doge would of crashed by now along with the hundreds of other alt copy cats.
@_date: 2014-05-23 15:54:58
I'll never respect dogecoin users.  They took what could have been an amazing combination, bitcoin and reddit's huge userbase, and instead made their own attempt at a get rich quick scheme many of them claimed bitcoin to be.
When you're trying to grow the popularity of something that has years of many people's hard work and tens of millions of dollars invested in it's infrastructure, you hope people would use it and work to make it better instead of mockingly making their own version based off a funny meme.

@_date: 2014-02-04 16:29:48
Dogecoin and it's user base is primarily a huge FU to Bitcoin, if we're going to be honest.
It's a mockery, and worse yet it takes away from the potential growth of Bitcoin which has a "outside of reddit" userbase, infrastructure, and investors that can actually give it a real future as the primary digital currency.
Reddit still could be a excellent opportunity to help the continued growth and success of Bitcoin, but with Dogecoin garnering so much attention of the user base we'll have to wait till the meme kids move on to something new.
@_date: 2014-05-23 15:58:26

The main point I see is this "bubble" is happening without the general public having a clue what is going on.  What really sent the dotcom bubble over the edge was when the media ran hard with how great it was and how much money was to be made, then people who had no idea what the internet was put their life savings in to companies to get rich quick and boom you've got a overvalued bubble ready to pop.
Once grams and gramps start asking you to help them buy a bitcoin because they saw the pretty news lady say it was a good investment, then you know there is likely a bubble that's soon to pop.  IMO we're at least a good month or so from that happening and by then who knows where BTC will be at.

This is what I think happened, no bubble popping just a orchestrated DDoS attack coinciding with massive buy and sell orders at specific points.  Unfortunately if this did happen it's still a nasty vulnerability that needs to be improved upon if we're every going to have bitcoin "make it" in the long run.
With current tech there is no way to stop DDoS attacks afaik, so the only solution is to work towards a concentrated effort to not use Mt Gox and hope others create more exchanges to compete.  Very difficult to do however as Mt Gox has in a way become synonymous with Bitcoin for many users and most if not all news reports discussing the currency.

I'll just say you should widen your informational net when it comes to guns and their negative and positive impacts on societies that own them. The recent Daily Show 3 part piece on Australia was a excellent example of the MSM presenting half truths to villify guns, and Im a huge Daily Show fan.  The internet has plenty of contrary viewpoints with statistics from post "gun removal" Australia that should make any thinking person reconsider their fearful position on guns.  Any time someone includes suicides in their statistical arguments against gun violence you have to know they have a blatant agenda that isn't honest.
As far as the economic based points I'll just say this. Libertarianism isn't anarchism, we understand you need some form of government and it needs taxes to survive.  The point is the current version of government is so vast and corrupt, that we've got to do whatever we can to limit spending on all the pork.  Until we can get serious about corruption and work towards removing it(GL!), the next best thing is to limit the corrupt government's power over society and let the free market work.  Right now with TBTF, there is no true free market only the corporate controlled government's version of the free market.
As for social services, I can't speak for all libertarians but I completely understand the current necessity for them.  The effects of just cutting these programs would be disastrous without first fixing the cause, which is the horrible costs of medical care for all Americans and the drastic wage growth disparity over the last 40-50 years.  Until that happens we need those programs to stay strong, unfortunately our "liberal" president is already offering them up on the chopping block in his budget proposals.
I think I understand why you feel you're not a libertarian from your explanations. I hope I've shed a little light on these issues as to why you could eventually become a libertarian over whatever you currently consider yourself.

Thanks for giving the community more exposure and more importantly giving us a inside look at Mt Gox.  
I do take a bit of issue with your initial explanation of bitcion, especially trying to focus on initial early adopters gaining "hordes" of bitcioins while those now get very little from mining.  To use that as a starting point is very dubious, framing the argument from the perspective that anyone trying to get into bitcion now has missed the boat.  
As far as bitcoin pieces in the MSM go, this was about as unbiased as you can expect.  Good to see something that wasn't a blatant hit piece.

You and many many others, which is why it will be very hard to "crash".  Since there is a limited amount out there and more and more figuring out what Bitcoins actually are instead of just listening to the "tulip 2.0" talking heads, it will take something drastic for the next large correction.

From what I've read on the bitcoin talk forums armory is the way to go for improved security so I use it personally and have already had to import my backed up coins after a mobo installation required a clean OS install, which worked fine.  
Only issue I've had so far is trying to set it up on a friends old/slow laptop(2 gig ram, unsure on cpu).  You need to run it on top of the bitcoin-qt wallet and the initial syncing up with the blockchain really lags his machine out.  Could just be something wrong with his comp though.

Real reason price WAS dropping(already back over 100), bitcoin is very volatile and two big stories came out late last night.  One legit one hoax.
Legit - BitcoinATM investor drops from the project the night before the planned media day.  Huge blow to the project, appears it may fall through.
Hoax - Mt. Gox raided by Japanese authorities.  CNN put up a ireport late last night that Mt Gox was raided, it's still up as I type and is linked from the main site.  It also claims that all users will have their accounts frozen by Friday, pretty good scare tactic eh?  Mt Gox has posted on their facebook that the raid never happened, but Im sure any CNN reader who saw that and was a casual bitcoin user would sell like mad which we saw earlier today.

The point of bitcoin is growing your potential market with little initial risk, not competing with your existing USD sales.  It's not like accepting bitcoin makes you no longer accept paypal/google wallet, it's a supplement to your current online sales strategy.

Bitcoin will reach those of lower income and education when the current tech barriers are taken down or muted through innovation by the community.

Word to the wise when it comes to mining profitability "projections".  As someone who blindly followed the mining projection charts of 2012 when deciding whether or not to buy a mining rig realizes now, there is one very important factor you cannot predict which is price.  
At the time bitcoins were $10-15 each, so all the fancy charts showed very little profit to be made with a long ROI due to projected difficulty increases.  However what ended up happening as we all saw was bitcions skyrocketed in value since that time meaning those who mined during the projected to be "barely profitable" times made a killing.
So the big question becomes will we see a increase in price to match the upcoming increase in difficulty that we saw earlier this year or are the two completely independent of one another?   These ASICs going online will bring a ton of thps, but can bitcoins community match that growth with an increased userbase?
@_date: 2013-11-09 21:46:06
What is happening with bitcoin is extremely common for something that has the potential to be immensely valuable in the future.  Periods of highs followed by corrections(sell offs).   To claim it's just a bubble infers that the price will eventually crash to near nothing which history has shown to be unfounded.
We're only in what we currently see as a high, we can all expect a correction at some point but it won't be below ~250(previous high) and I surely will be buying back in at that point.  Due to the potential value and growing market use Bitcoin is poised to continue to set new highs after corrections unless something drastic happens to try and stop it from succeeding.

Paid for?  yes. Avalon and Butterfly both have been taking orders for many months now.
Received?  that's the million mBTC question..
Avalon is the only one to have shipped so far, batch 1 of 300 units.  Not sure when the next batch is due or how many units there are.  They've already sold out of orders for batch 3 so the next time they take orders it will be for batch 4.  Oh btw they go for ~10k US, AND you can only place orders in BTC so if you plan on ordering, get to converting.
Butterfly started taking orders before Avalon and have yet to ship, with their latest claimed shipping date being "2 weeks".  They have taken many many orders without producing anything which has some people questioning whether they will ever produce.  They do offer many different units at varying prices(anywhere from ~500-30k US) and accept non BTC currency for orders.  I personally can't trust them enough to order before they at least start shipping the first batch, but by then it may be too late to start mining difficulty wise when you actually receive yours.

Going from 50 to 267 in few days is a bubble
Going from 400 to 900 in a day is a bubble
Going from 850 to 950 in a day is just normal growth.   
Believe me you'll know the difference when the next bubble expands, it'll rapidly rise and pop around 1500-1700 imo.

At the current value for bitcoins GPU mining will die out sometime between now and June 1st, when difficulty is projected to spike from the current 9 mil to 23.6 mil.
Of course if bitcoins rise in value, profitability could continue on for GPU miners.  It's a pretty big risk to jump in at this point however.

Didn't you hear?  Your coins are worthless, all that trading that's going on where people are spending 80-90 USD this very instant for a bitcoin is just your imagination.
At least, that's what I've come to understand from reading all the anti bitcoin trolls festering in this subreddit this fine evening.

You're just naive enough to believe people can get to the highest positions in their respective fields(in this case journalism) by being ignorant.
Others understand that the media is just a bunch of yes men and women who parrot what their higher ups tell them to run as stories.  "Reporters" have become "Repeaters" for decades now, and all main stream media stories have a collective bias for the status quo and against establishment rocking ideas like bitcoin.

"never buy bitcoins"
"what can you buy with bitcoins?" "drugs"
great press for the mainstream who have no clue what bitcoins are....

Bitpay is better for merchants imo. It's much more reliable and lets you decide how much you want to convert to fiat or hold on to from your sales.
It makes the volatility argument moot imo, if you can convert to fiat at the point of sale then it doesn't matter if Bitcoins increase or decrease afterwards.

The repeaters don't know, Im talking about the people who actually choose which stories get reported on and give the repeaters their talking points that promote the establishment's agenda.
The editors, and their bosses, are the ones who are far from ignorant and to believe they get to those levels in this industry by being ignorant is like I said earlier, naive to put it kindly.  It's understandable why you'd think that, it's very hard to come to grips with the reality that people in power don't want whats best for the common man.  It's much easier for the human mind to white wash it away as ignorance.

Is it time to implement a 51% rule/suggestion on exchanges like we do mining pools?
The community is currently too reliant on Mt Gox to succeed long term, it seems most agree, how can we fix it?  Just saying "use other exchanges" is a great start, but we really need to somehow do more.
