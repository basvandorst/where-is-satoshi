I’ll say it again and again:
Play stupid games, get a life sentence.
Run a market for drugs, human trafficking, extorsion, fraud, rental killers... who is the fucking mental that defends this psycopath?!

Drop wirex ASAP.
They are the most fraudulent company i ever experienced.

Point per point:
1. If there are more criminals receiving lesser sentences, that doesn’t make you any better.
There is law, and there are criminals, period.
Judges and lawyers do their work at the very best of their abilities.
2. Would you condemn a life sentence to a street drug trafficker who killed and ruined potentially thousands of lifes? I would, not blinking.
Now, what if that trafficker even developed a WHOLE NEW market, hiding behind stupid libertarian ideologies and provided harder ways to identify and prosecute... Death penalty, create a scary precedent for Ross 2.0
3. Even if executions, human trafficking etc... were not allowed, there was demand. It doesn’t takes any knowledge to stumble upon such sites in the dark web. The fact that the platform was used to connect individuals with those criminals is enough.
Yes, drugs should be legalized and prescrived to people in medical conditions.
No, this guy should rotten in jail.
Yes, so far Silk Road is the only TESTED use case for Bitcoin at the moment, and it created a social stigma for everyone related to crypto.

I don’t care about him, but your intentions to convince a +90YO rich man to buy something.
@_date: 2019-07-14 15:46:59
It doesn’t matter how you think it is, you’re taking profit out of him.
It’s clear you don’t love your gp.
@_date: 2019-07-24 14:12:15
They are sick twisted fuckers

Who in the hell really thinks 4% (+–13M/327M) of USA has some bitcoin exposure?
@_date: 2019-07-19 07:57:50
Full of shit, the guy’s a clown.
@_date: 2019-07-14 13:23:58
He‘s alone... weird tactic to get people‘s interest. 
Kind of lunatic, but nvmd.
@_date: 2019-07-14 15:47:50
People, don’t be this guy.
@_date: 2019-07-14 13:26:35
Bitcoin and crypto is the most corrupted asset already... don‘t trust the phallacies you’re being told.

If you sell enough during the bull rull, if your transactions completes before the chain gets ridiculously expensive and slow, if you dont sell it the day before moon, if your exchange wallet doesn’t get “hacked”, if your exchange does not stop accepting new registrations, if your exchange doesn’t go to “unscheduled upgrade”, if CZ Binance doesnt attempts a fucking re-org...
You might get a house afterwards.

Bravo, nick.
@_date: 2019-07-14 13:13:09
Oh well... that‘s embarrasing

Your grandpa has made more money than you will ever do.
You’re not teaching him anything, you’re profiting from his fortune and hard earned money.
I bet you’re counting the days already...

@_date: 2019-08-03 23:07:00
OP where’s that “Centre de la Vila”? 
I nevere have heard of it!
@_date: 2019-08-07 15:24:08
Perfect, now you have been not only scammed, but made yourself a target...
Do not ever reveal how much you have, I-DI-OT!
You see the internet cable right there? 
Yes, that one... cut it off
@_date: 2019-08-10 11:22:15
Oh thanks men! Well sumarized!
I used electrum to create the address but I couldn‘t create a 3XXX address... don‘t ask me why :/
Where can I create a 3 wallet? Which „provider“?
Thanks a lot!
