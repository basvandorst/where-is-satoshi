Well it's suppose to open up soon! I'd rather have my funds available once trading opens up then having to wait 3-4 days.

Yeah LTC &amp; peercoin

They do accept deposits at BMO though.

But it's also $99/m for unlimited trades.

Thank you for your input. I was looking for an answer from someone possibly in my country who has already done their taxes and included bitcoin in previous years. I thought I could get a general idea before calling the cra in the morning.

I got this same auto reply on Monday... I'm assuming this means we're on a list and just have to wait.

Its major fault is lack of volume. Good e change though.

I completely agree. I wanted to cry for weeks. I bought only 40 coins at 720 around the whole nothing event of jan 30th.. This was after weeks of the price being 800-840. After the whole gox throw down I threw them into cold storage and lost the chance to sell them in the 700s at a small loss.... 6 weeks later it's below 400. I keep positive in the thoughts of 'if it can drop that much it can also rise by the same amount'. I've since invested in another 50 coins and made some good calls and I would be pretty much even if I sold my coins in storage thanks to day trading..

Like below, I feel that's an unfair assumption. They launched alts jan 30th ish. Since then the outside markets have been all over the place while VoS has stayed the almost the same.

After some googling it appears to be an issue with chrome accepting secure certificates.. But stamp is the only site I've ever gotten the error on. 
@_date: 2014-05-24 23:36:04
I was wondering if anyone else gets this error. Usually I just press back and it fixes itself but I've gotten it on many computers and I'm just wondering what it's all about.

A month. 1% of ~$10000 is $100. After that you're saving money.

Average day trader? I can rack up $100 in fees on stamp depending on the day. Unless you're messing around with less then 10btc it's actually a great deal.

I like it. It just takes days because I can't get verified because I'm not American. I was wondering if an American bank account would allow me to be verified, or not because coinbase also does a credit check to verify.
