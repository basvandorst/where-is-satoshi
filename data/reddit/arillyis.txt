It's the most recent data. I get annoyed when people bring up what happened in 2014; like somehow that could happen again. There was basically 1 barely competent exchange that "collapsed" after a "hack." Things are completely different now.

I hear you. Any relatively long term  prediction can't be substantiated. 
All i'm saying is one freak event from 2014 is the least representative of bitcoin today and I get so sick of how often people toss it around like the exact thing is going to happen. 
However I do disagree that an equally damaging event could occur just as easily because there are more exchanges and those exchanges actually know what theyre doing now (not run by a fool), plus more people secure their coins off exchanges.

I'm imagining you actually bought 2 dollars worth of btc with the min 2.99 fee

I like your acknowledgement of their enthusiasm.

This continues to be the theory but continues to not be what happens.

I hear ya. So say i move my coins to a hardware wallet during the split. After the split bittrex says it supports both. What happens then? How would i transfer and split from my wallet to bittrex? 
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:11:56
Can you give a bit more explanation? I have mine on bittrex and id like to know what issues that could create if left there during the split. 
I see this short response everywhere with little or no explanation. I get that its always good to control your own keys, but what makes it more crucial during the split?
@_date: 2017-10-18 12:52:18
Fuck you to your current boss/moving to the tropics money for sure

Is the seed just the 26 word phrase it gives? Then is that the only thing i would need if my ledger broke?
@_date: 2017-10-20 01:03:17
I recently (in the last week) purchased a ledger nano s on amazon and got it in 3 days. You can transfer from coinbase very easily. Before buying my ledger I had moved some coin from coinbase to bittrex and it was a hassle (their verification process is overkill and their support staff is swamped) and ultimately costlier since i had to pay fees for transactions each way. Buying with coinbase and transferring to hardware is very simple and i suggest it for now before the split. Seems like everything is unclear after that. 
(Split is next week right?)

You really see no way in which someone could possibly buy a vacation home with a hypothetical 5 million dollars?
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:31:13
Drug-related, but I see your point.
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:44:09
Hah I hear ya. Level with me though. How bout buy a vacation home in that tropical country that you can rent out while you/family/friends aren't there? Best of both worlds. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:27:46
Dozens, you say?
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:55:54
Maybe its just a fishing boat. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 08:54:51
Wait, did they release their source of the DNC leaks?
Serious question btw.
