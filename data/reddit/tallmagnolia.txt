I think you should look at who is influencing government. It's money and special interests with lots of money pushing policy. The majority of "the government" are made up of average people. Middle class people, even. It seems like a lot of people direct their anger at "the government" without realizing who is pulling the strings. Let's take back our government and make it work for us instead of the special interests with the most money.

LoL, you are really confused if you aren't being sarcastic. You should consider the implications of using sarcastic tones in plain text. Frankly, everything you said is stupid, but you're naive to believe that libertarianism is the solution.

You're regressing, you were doing better for a minute there. Please try much, much harder.

Yes the actual fuck, even. I was drawn to libertarianism at first myself, until I realized that its biggest promoters were rich neo-cons. It's kind of a bait and switch really. It promises more liberty/freedom but dismantles the systems that give 99% of us freedom from tyranny. 
It only serves the wealthy and those who control production. It relies on the false premis that there is a natural free market out there, currently restrained by regulations. The opposite is true and the "free market" has been warped and manipulated by a number of players and factors. Most notably, those who promote libertarianism.

Its all the same, dude. Neoconservatism is ever changing. Don't rely on Google definitions to substitute research on your end.  It's you and these "libertarians" and Tea Partiers who are confused. Neoconservatism has changed every decade from the moment it was born in the 60s. Whether or not it supports the MIC,  perpetual war, the war on drugs, the revolving door, the media and the federal reserve it seeks to rule government through oligarchy. The players are the same. You guys pretend to be so enlightened, what a fucking joke. Bring on the downvote brigade, pussies.

When you say they tend to miss out on them, I think they fall for them most often and high end investors are more cautious. That is only my perception though.

It's scary how circe jerky you and your friends are. I'm not a statist, but because someone disagrees with me and linked me to your shitty sub you all jump on board. That guy even started making pathetically flawed strawman arguments for me, shit I would never say. It's pretty sad, really. There's something I've learned about many libertarians I've met, they are pissed off and lack social critical thinking skills. They are smart people who have been looking for a good political system to follow, and when they are let down they give up.
@_date: 2014-07-06 15:10:48
I can't even put the effort into reading your shitty responses. That's the problem, why I can't answer your questions. 
@_date: 2014-07-06 16:19:02
It's not at all. It has been co-opted. You will learn one day, I'm sure. There is no political system designed to serve you, it's a cancer. Or not... maybe one day I'll learn something new, but in the mean time political systems are not working in your favor, especially libertarianism. 
@_date: 2014-07-05 18:45:48
That's the ultra-liberal wrapping paper, fool. You are right about one thing, present politics do not serve you.

This is great, you can present your own bad arguments and defeat them all by yourself! Now THAT is something to love. Do you have any other strawman arguments you would like to attribute to your shadow? I would love to hear your next argument, which you will surely shoot down all by yourself.

Are you a downvote brigade puss?
@_date: 2014-10-03 18:58:10
They way it's phrased here makes it sound like some kind of conspiracy. Citizens generally trust the government more than individuals to obtain more firepower. As much as they might abuse the weapons, they would be far more frightening in the hands of private citizens or organizations. We are more oppressed through means of policy and money than firepower, by orders of magnitude.

Political labels as most people understand them are a joke. The last two democratic presidents have been moderate conservatives. Starting with Clinton who redefined welfare into disability which pushed obsolete workers away from state liability and on to the federal government. Then, of course, he repealed Glass-Steagall. 
Obama is much the same, supporting the revolving door and appointing conservative industry insiders to government positions. His only problem is that congress is in gridlock. It hasn't "changed" so much as its ever evolving. 
Cheney doesn't need a new label, he is just a key player on the MIC who succeeded in producing astounding results for he Haliburton crowd. I know what the problem is here. Neocons have succeeded in convincing you and most others that there is a subset political group that is worse than the others who deserve this label, and the rest aren't quite as bad. It's simply not the case, because they are all part of the same oligarchical set. This is the point that libertarians miss the most. Libertarianism isn't a rejection of these systems, it's an acceptance of the end game system that neocons are looking for, because it was created by them. The evidence is right there in the neocon/libertarian think tanks I mentioned earlier. 
*War is being privatized, and the police are becoming the new national army. It doesn't get any clearer than that.

In this case, ultra-rich, ultra-conservative republicans who created the Tea Party which is the libertarian wing of the ultra-conservative movement. They fund think tanks like the Cato Institute, The Heritage Foundation and The Chamber of Commerce. Thanks to them and the astrotrurf Tea Party movement congress has been effectively deadlocked since 2008. 
They have basically gotten what they want, ineffective government that works only for the lobbyists and big fat money. Thanks to them we have super-PACs, welfare subsidized minimum wages and growing disillusionment with our government. Because of this the "democratic" party has kneejerked right and President Obama has become the most moderate conservative president in 30 years. They are the Oligarchs in this plutocracy, the United States of America. 
Neo-con: the new conservative.  Satisfied?
@_date: 2014-07-05 17:48:13
Libertarianism is neo-conservatism in a paper thin, faux ultra-liberal wrapping paper. I cannot support anything endorsed so fervently by the Kochs.
@_date: 2014-07-06 03:21:20
These libertarian clowns are just a bunch of circlejerks looking for any reason to claim another soul, too high and mighty to admit that their movement was created by ultra-rich neo-cons and can't see how a downvote brigade is the biggest circle jerk of all time.

LOL, poor libertarian... the only evidence you need is to see who is promoting libertarianism. They are actively subverting your liberty through current political systems, lobbies and vast amounts of money. If you think there is such a thing as the free market, then look to see who has ruined it. It's a giant pitcher of kool-aid, buddy.
