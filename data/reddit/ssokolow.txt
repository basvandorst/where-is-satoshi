The Pyra is a pocketable gaming laptop. The Shield is an Android-powered gaming console made portable. They're completely different things.
I own its precursor, the OpenPandora, and here's what I mean when I describe both of them as "pocketable gaming laptops":
* Full QWERTY-variant keyboards (Pyra has an improved layout)
* Shoulder buttons mapped to modifier keys (eg. Ctrl, Alt,...) when running in "full desktop GUI" mode for easy key combos.
* Resistive touchscreens for enough precision to control a traditional desktop OS's mouse-oriented UI using the included stylus.
* Mouse drivers which allow you to use the analog sticks like the touchpoint microjoystick on an IBM/Lenovo Thinkpad.
* Real Linux, fully supported. (An Ångstrom Linux variant on the Pandora, real Debian Linux on the Pyra)
* A completely unlocked yet unbrickable bootloader and an OS where the 3D blob is purely in userspace, allowing ongoing kernel updates.
  * For the Pandora, there's actually a utility that lets you hot-swap 3D blob versions to work around bugs discovered after vendor support ended.
  * Some people run their Pandora IDEs on the Pandora rather than cross-compiling. The Pyra's higher-resolution screen and faster processor will make that much more feasible.
* An enthusiastic community with some really brilliant ARM assembly hackers and a package ecosystem oriented around coming as preconfigured as legally possible. (eg. PCSX-ReARMed emulates backups of my aging PSX CDs on my 600MHz Pandora better than regular PCSX does on my Athlon II X2 270 desktop.)
Also, both the Pandora and the Pyra are roughly the same dimensions as an original Nintendo DS but more blocky to fit the additional hardware. Much more pocketable than the Shield's "chubby XBox controller" design.

As an OpenPandora owner who both legally emulates Playstation games (I'm a bit of a collector) and uses the analog sticks like an IBM TrackPoint mouse, I can second that.
With the addition of enough shoulder buttons to map all four relevant modifier keys (Ctrl, Alt, Shift, Fn), I expect the Pyra to be the only device I've ever seen which makes desktop apps comfortable on the go. (I've never been a big fan of touchpads and I can't stand the lack of tactile feedback with an on-screen keyboard.)

Here are a few reasons I bought the OpenPandora that an Ubuntu phone can't replicate:
* Tactile feedback without having to carry around a folding Bluetooth keyboard and find a table.
* Shoulder buttons mapped to Ctrl/Alt/etc. so desktop key combos can still be performed comfortably.
* Integrated physical gaming controls for when I feel like taking a break.
* Completely unlocked but with an unbrickable first-stage loader.
* Resistive touchscreen so I can use my fingernail as a high-precision stylus (desktop apps wouldn't know what to do with a multi-touch gesture anyway)
* Components chosen so that any unavoidable binary blobs (eg. 3D driver) will be completely in userspace and won't block ongoing kernel upgrades (This is why the Pandora got the SoC it did and the Pyra's was chosen to maintain maximum compatibility with all of the great, well-optimized ports).
* Debian Linux with the most standard componentry possible, not Ubuntu's strange "reinvent the world" platform stack that had to be dragged, kicking and screaming, from Upstart to systemD and is still going full-steam ahead with Mir despite their arguments against Wayland+libhybris being proven false long ago and their "this'll be ready much quicker" projections having slipped to a laughable degree.
* No cellular modem in the Pandora while the Pyra's is optional and a separate chip connected over internal USB ([no DMA]( and it has no control over its indicator light. (eg. I can either omit GPS support or have a SIM slot with minimal worry about IMSI/IMEI-logging devices when not in use)
* Two external SD card slots for lots of storage and, for the Pyra, the internal storage can be overridden by a MicroSD card.
* Analog sticks can be used like an IBM TouchPoint microjoystick mouse (I'm not a big fan of touchpads and the desktop apps I want to run aren't optimized for a direct-touch screen, so I tend to use them more than the resistive touchscreen.)
* Gaming buttons are mapped to Page Up/Page Down/Home/End when using the desktop, which compensates beautifully for the lack of direct-touch scrolling and shortcomings of TouchPoint-style mice.
* Enthusiastic community which developed things like [glshim]( (Like Wine, but for running things which use immediate-mode OpenGL on OpenGL ES devices) and a patchset for SDL which offloads scaling to the GPU's hardware overlay support.
**EDIT:** Sorry for the BBcode. Recovering from an all-nighter and spent too much time on BBcode-based forums recently.
