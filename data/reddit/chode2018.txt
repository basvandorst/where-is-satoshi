eventually the usd as it exists today will fail. Money is created when debt is created and so any talk of paying the debt off is ludicrous. It can’t happen. Not since Andrew Jackson has the United States been financially free.

No it will not take that long.

Two words, Andrew Jackson. The eternal foe of speculative central banks, the only person to pay down debt of a major nation in the last few hundred years.....possibly longer than that. The banks literally tried to kill him a few times. Then when that didn’t work and he did pay off the debt, the Bank of England raised rates which screwed the US for years. 
The fed is private. No one knows who owns it and benefits from it, but it isn’t common folk. It loans money at interest. The national debt is a method of theft, subjugation, and repression: it cannot be paid off in the traditional sense of using assets to pay down debt. Every dollar out there has interest due on it. 
If a dollar is created, a dollar plus another percentage of a dollar is owed back. So take this example. $1,000 is created at 1%. So $1,010 is owed back. But if taking the loan created the money, and in this example this is the first transaction, where do you get the $10 in interest that doesn’t exist? Easy, take out another loan.  And so on. 
If you bought a house and didn’t pay the debt, the bank would take your house. If the national debt isn’t paid, the credit rating would tank and lots of other collateral based things would happen. Full faith and CREDIT. But the fed just wants to stay in control of everything, they don’t want to take ownership of collateral since they own everything anyway. 
So in sum, any talk of anyone in a position of authority in the government to change favorably, audit, or eradicate the fed has no meaning. It won’t happen. I thought Ron Paul was on to something for a while but he would have gotten sniped out if he was president and his son is a phony. Also, any talk of the debt being paid off is also a complete joke as I just mentioned above. It can’t be, by design. 
Bitcoin is actually very Jeffersonian/Jacksonian because both camps favored competing, sound money coming from banks that had specie, tangible assets, and no speculative funny business. Bitcoin is as auditable and hard as it gets. Its everything gold is without the drawbacks.

The basic premise is that those in control of the money supply own and control everything. And they do not permit perfect audit trails. Even if we were on a gold standard they wouldn’t let you see how much gold. That’s why btc is so important. Decentralized and perfect audit trail.

Cash already has a negative return, it’s called Inflation.

He had a slightly psychotic laugh that conveys he knows how unbelievably rich he will become (or is now). A laugh that can only be laughed when that person truly doesn’t care and the other person’s buy in truly doesn’t matter. I find his arguments very convincing.

Article states only accredited investors can buy gbtc. This is incorrect.
