Holy shit you can make money out of this with monthly subscriptions? 
I already have a working code base with most markets supported. (they all offer fairly easy to use APIs anyway). Took me just three hours yesterday.  
Time to setup a nice web service with RoR.

So that's the reason it is falling that hard? Or is the person responsible for the hack mass selling the coins?
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:52:49
Well you could also just rewind it. 
10,000€! When 1000€?

This sub is getting more and more ridiculous... Mods should do something and delete these false accusations. It makes this sub look terrible.

THat's a valid question and the answer is: yes. Hodl until you want to cash out / need money. There isn't anything more to it.

They just sold when they thought they made good profit.

You should make sure everyone reads the line: "This data is useless" because it were only 560 votes, people could vote multiple times, not even secured by any means - just change IP - vote again.  
And no the readers and users from those two sites are not the same. Not one of my friends and co-workers who are located in Germany and use bitcoin.de have ever been on the blog at all. They were quite surprised that there was a poll when I asked them about it.
I would really love such a poll in a big exchange in which every user only has one vote.

Noooo, I need you to crash not to raise!

You are dumb. Go to Western Europe. Works perfectly fine there.

Thx. So having it dynamically means I will never run into problems.

What the fuck are you talking about? Right now I can go to any medical institution including dentists, eye doctors, any you can imagine and get treated within 1h without making an appointment. Or I can make an appointment and skip all the waiting. Everything for free.

Why is it hodl and not hold?
@_date: 2017-04-30 23:16:30
It's only 100k.... that's what you earn in a year. Not worth losing a friendship. 
@_date: 2017-04-30 23:19:29
True, but would those people know about Bitcoin and its value?

What's an ETF?

Obvious choice. Future of money and future of cars work nicely together.

What? In Europe you buy internet access from a provider and you get VOIP (free calls in all of your country) which is the standard here for every telephone, plus free HD TV over internet. All phones (not mobiles!) and TVs are using this system. If not there are free routers with built-in converters.

Are you me? I bought high because that was the only time I had some spare money. And I needed some emergency money so I had to sell some low.... fuck me.
@_date: 2017-05-03 11:19:43
Honest question. What about the people who don't care if Bitcoin hits 5k or stays at 1k. Some people just want to use it as a currency and therefore they don't care if they get 1Bitcoin for their 1000Bucks or more since they just want to spend their money using crypto.

The 12 words are the private keys? Got it!

Well that's a pretty shitty thing to say about refugees...
@_date: 2017-07-15 23:51:58
hodling is dumb. Why hodl when you can make 2 BTC out of 1BTC?

Write your own script that buys whenever there is a X-% drop over time period Y. And sell when there is a Z% over another time period A increase. Then have some worst-case scenario prevention triggers - done. 
@_date: 2017-05-03 13:56:20
I am not sure about that. If you only look at Indie for example. There are lots of people who only use it as currency for spending their money. And India's population is huge. It seems more realistic that there are at least 50% if not more.

I am using jaxx.io wallet. Do they have my private keys? 
Is there a better wallet for bitcoin as well as ether?

First by realizing it isn't as big as a threat as they make you think it is. People should be more concerned about a lot of other things that cause deaths than foreign terrorism. If you actually go by numbers there are other issues far more crucial in preventing deaths and money spent in these areas would help more than any sort of counterterrorism.
