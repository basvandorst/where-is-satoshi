Sorry that I came off as a pedant, I didn't intend to. What I listed were concerns / questions that I have at my current understanding of bitcoin systems. I haven't yet found the answers, or even much discussion, of these points.
Thank you for the reference, I will check it out.

The more I learn about Bitcoin, the dimmer the lightbulb gets.
I don't see how the amount of energy that needs to be poured into the system to keep it decentralized is sustainable in the long run.
Nor do I see how the system can scale to global transaction numbers, even with side chains.

Not to mention that the entire premise of "decentralized currency" is misleading considering the pseudo-governing body making decisions about long term changes in the algorithm. 
Do you trust the [people]( voting on forks to have your best interest in mind? How are these people going to be different from the current 'state' in 5 years time? 10 years time?

So who proposes the forks? Who decides on which forks are committed? How is this group different from a governing body - or further, the FED?
What prevents this body from deciding that the arbitrary cutoff of 21 million bitcoins is too low, attrition from accidental loss of coins is a problem, and voting to issue a new set of coins to miners? Say 100 million?
There're still people in control of / editing the underlying code. The changes to this code will benefit or harm their interests. Bitcoin is not inherently divorced from societal processes. Bitcoin is not an anarcho-capitalist solution, there is still power distributed, just to different people.
