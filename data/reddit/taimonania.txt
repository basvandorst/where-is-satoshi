I agree with everything you say except one point: the reason why we can't send any transaction isn't because of an attack from BCH or someone outside the community.
It is because BTC got too popular and there was or is no immediate solution to scale except bigger blocks, and for some reason the majority of people think to increase the block size limit to 2-8MB will doom BTC. 
I think it is the other way round. If BTC would scale on-chain for the short-term, to give developers time to implement LN, then the attack of BCH wouldn't have been possible at all.
In the end we probably have to increase the block size limit anyways, even when LN is working ...

You are wrong (in my opinion) concerning Hard forks. Hard forks with consensus are a necessary step to improve software and shouldn't be avoided. The problem with Bitcoin was/still is that there is no consensus in the community or the miners which way to go.
And I think that's the case because both sides (BTC and BCH) are going forward with extreme solutions: don't scale at all on-chain (BTC) [but wants to scale off-chain] and scale as much as possible on-chain (BCH) [but doesn't want to scale off-chain short-term].
Edit: As was mentioned in a comment: BTC of course plans to implement other options to scale off-chain. Such as LN.

Only problem is the routing algorithm doesn't exist/work yet :/
So it could still take some time until this bot can withdraw funds

Why would a lot of 0 fee txs cause the price to go up? Those who want their tx to confirm fast (and probably also all the algorithms) look at the fee of the current txs that are included into a block, and how many there are somewhat cheaper.
Right now txs with 0-200 sat/byte don't do much to the price since they aren't confirmed at all anyways in the foreseeable future.

Thank you very much! We have the same opinion, I just got the terminology wrong ...
I thought if an update is backwards-compatible it is a soft work, and if it is not it is a hard fork. Didn't know the further distinction that you can have a non-backwards-compatible update with consensus which is also a soft fork.
Thanks for incentivizing me to do a research about that ;)

I think you are the only one in here who thought about the opportunity cost the miners lose. 
But do you really think it is profitable to pump the fee price up? They would have to do this constantly, constantly missing out opportunity fees.
Is there some source that calculated this?

Actually Bitcoin Cash is worth about 1/5th of Bitcoin (Core) right now. Where are you getting your data from?
Right now 1 BCH is ~0.21 BTC
Even if you look at the total (percentage) growth of BTC vs BCH since the fork, BCH is slightly ahead right now.
I don't think this data says much about the future, but if you're doing an argument, CryptoKid9, please use the real data or provide a source for your claims.

The last paragraph is paraphrasing what Roger said in a wrong way, I think.
He said this only about BTC. He thinks right now it is better to keep your BTC on an exchange because when hashing power suddenly leaves for BCH there will be a lot less blocks mined and it will be incredibly expensive (or even impossible) to move your BTC to an exchange and trade it.

Yes that is right. Didn't want to spread confusion, just wanted to emphasize the difference.
I edited and included this.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:31:55
But the fundamental argument (as I understand it) that BCH does isn't about the technology in the whitepaper, it is about the vision and ideology that Bitcoin should be a p2p network that enables everybody to do cheap transactions, be anonymous and function well as a currency.
At most of these points Bitcoin (Core), as it is right now, fails miserably. 
This is the factual truth right now and I really don't understand why we can't scale short-term on-chain and long-term off-chain with LN ...

Thanks for your informative and totally grown-up answer. I really appreciate debates on this level of intelligence. /s

Real question here: Doesn't segwit increase the block size? As I understood it this isn't a compression, but a method to have bigger blocks without increasing the block size limit. Isn't that true?

Had the same problem. You can use the Coinbase-App to verify a second form of identification, which will then "synchronise" with GDAX.
Works way better than their verification in the browser.

Really nice looking site! Better than everything I've seen so far.
One usability recommendation: 
When adding a new transaction it would be really nice to be able to type in the actual amount I have paid for the e.g. BTCs, rather than the rate (had to recalculate it for every transaction, since I don't remember)
Also, I would love to be able to use EUR instead of USD as currency in a new transaction.
Other than that, really nice work you've done there!

Already now the miners are partially paid by transaction fees. While the reward by creating new bitcoins decrease the transaction fees will continue to pay the miners.
