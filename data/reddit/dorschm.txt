Nah it's some older woman lol super cheap Chinese shit your dad did to your place i guess it's yours for a lot more if you deliver it was and you can move in the tutorial as well as a possible alternative to advertisements on the site and I'll show yah but I forgot raven has the keys by accident and I'll show you how much for soon.

We don't sell any narcotics sorry.

Sounds like a clever scam to make some money with no corporate info.
@_date: 2014-02-01 21:13:50
Thanks I appreciate it. However I am specifically targeting Canada so other countries opinions on Bitcoin does not matter so much.
@_date: 2014-01-15 00:31:16
We are upgrading to a new server soon. I was not expecting this many members so quickly in the soft launch period.
@_date: 2014-02-01 06:23:45
That's why I want some help with it. It is an intro to a Business Plan I am writing for local business owners to convince them to take Bitcoin.

The site is new and we are still forming the FAQ. All the ads on the site are provided by the site, advertisers purchase credits here and advertise here. 
What makes you think this is fraud or is soliciting dumb advertisers? What is dumb about advertising directly to bitcoin interested users?
@_date: 2014-06-25 04:33:25
Oh no? Is it a scam or something? 
@_date: 2014-01-11 05:40:46
You're looking at it as a per member basis, when only 4 members have withdrawn. But you're free to have your opinion.
@_date: 2014-02-01 02:09:25
I looked at that list a few days ago and it only had BMO, it is much more updated, thanks for the share.
@_date: 2014-01-11 07:15:46
You can see more proper information here regarding payments:
Just wanted to let you know that it is in no way a statistic that should be assumed to be every members earnings. Less then 1% of the total members have requested a withdrawal so far as the site is in its infancy.
@_date: 2014-02-01 02:48:36
Try translating the message, problem is there is nothing to care about in this for most people due to the fact that:
* They are not in Hong-Kong   
* The message is not translated
* The only thing that may grab anyone's attention is the QR code, which is now becoming like a banner ad to most people and automatically ignored by the brain.

I am still trying to get bitcoin off BitVegas
@_date: 2014-02-01 21:15:20
Wow that is good stuff. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-01-10 06:59:16
It's nice to see at least one pleasant comment before I go to bed. :)
@_date: 2014-01-10 06:10:19
That is the payouts requested in the first day so far, that is correct.
@_date: 2014-05-12 07:55:26
God dammit. You are not white you racist. Not even albino's are truly white. At most your light brown or off pink. Now quit being a racist and learn the word Caucasian.
@_date: 2014-01-10 06:05:32
The website is only a day old. We have only had two payouts of about a dollar each.
My websites are honest, even if it's a low number.
@_date: 2014-02-01 06:22:37
That seems to be what I am going to have to do. Not that bad a plan with insurance anyways.
@_date: 2014-01-10 06:05:04
There is no fraud here, there is more to earn paying my members and keeping them then scamming them.
@_date: 2014-02-01 02:19:10
Not be be a downer, just sharing some info here. 
The old post didn't go anywhere and on Reddit, you can trust people saw it, they just didn't care enough to post.
@_date: 2014-02-01 02:03:56
Yes that is the issue, even at the bank I have a personal account they would not allow me to open a business account. Apparently they have a "anit-bitcoin policy due to how new it is and the lack of laws in place at the current time" and will not allow any bitcoin related business to open an account.
@_date: 2014-02-21 09:31:48
Thank you very much for the review! Reading things like this really brightens my day.
@_date: 2014-05-05 20:00:36
The design will be up soon, till then the site is just blank default and basically only accepting registrations.
@_date: 2014-01-10 06:25:10
Do you all hate the website so much? Websites like this can only help bitcoin and don't hurt it.
Or are you all mad as you feel I am advertising?
 I don't understand this sub-reddit sometimes.
@_date: 2014-02-01 03:37:19
No one, likely a scammer due to this. (Not that OP is a scammer)
@_date: 2014-01-10 05:36:31
Seems many people want to earn their first bit and faucets are not fast enough.
@_date: 2017-01-11 20:38:00
Lol you still got it wrong even with the edit.
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:00:25
SNES had that too in Japan and it was better :P
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:58:49
How? Because it hasn't yet.
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:21:03
How fast something gets 'sold out' is not any indicator of quality or even sales. I can sell out my 10 boxes of crap and say it sells better because it sold out, meanwhile someone selling 1000 boxes out of 2000 isn't sold out but they sure sold a lot more....

I just keep hearing that all cloud mining is a scam but I mean there are enough buyers on nicehash that I make a good return so it's gotta be profitable to purchase the hashes or at least cheaper than buying the alt coins directly that the hashes end up mining. Otherwise why are people buying?
@_date: 2017-10-25 03:25:08
Never heard of prohashing. Are they often more profitable for GPU mining?
@_date: 2017-10-05 22:45:41
This is what your post looks like:  
It's just odd formatting is all, you do have two point number 1's and no point 2, and the 2nd point 1 is in quotes. Not quotation marks, but quote formatting.
@_date: 2017-10-25 03:31:48
Are you GPU Mining? Which do you find better? I have 2 1060's and 1 1070 and make about 0.7-1 btm a day with nicehash.
EDIT: Oh it looks like they don't really even support GPU mining. Well that solves that issue for me :p
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:29:07
Switching mining payouts? What do you use?
@_date: 2017-10-06 08:49:19
I use them as a miner but am not sure how it works for buyers. How is it different than cloud mining? Do you buy a specific amount of hashes delivered instantly for like a second rather than a constant hash rate forever?
@_date: 2017-10-05 22:46:43
What about nicehash? Or is that different?
@_date: 2016-10-09 16:28:00
@_date: 2017-07-29 22:44:37
If that's truly the case, why is everyone withdrawing?
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:54:15
Because the only reason they don't want to support it is so they can claim all the bcc left on the site.
@_date: 2013-12-09 06:42:45
No, you would be banned if you did so, it is only for new players. I would also get in trouble. :p

As someone from the EU, you know 9000% more about Canada then an American does.
(American's pride themselves in their ignorance of Canada)

Shoot me a PM to get the code. :)
@_date: 2013-12-09 06:43:34
I gave out several codes to people PMing me, and it seems there is no disinterest in this, how it is at negative votes?
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:28:00
Download the game, and during signup at the login screen, put the code I PM'd you. The bonus is tremendous!
