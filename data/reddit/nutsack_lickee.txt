I would suggest finding a way to collaborate with the guys that are creating that new email protocol that uses encryption as a standard (Levinson et. al.). This is a great feature and would be a selling point for that new system.

Feels good to read that article over my VPN + TOR. Oh, and posting this anonymously so I can actually express my genuine opinion, a right guaranteed to me by the 1st and 4th amendments of the Constitution, the supreme law of the land.

That's the risk premium for no MTL.

I would think this would be very important, and should be trivial to implement.

Most people here do not understand how a business works, and could never (successfully) run one themselves. The Bitcoin economy is very shallow right now and the Trezor is priced appropriately. I would guess we are 5-10 years away from a Trezor that is priced at $1. 
Judging by the majority of the comments I've seen ("Walmart" Bitcoiners) there will be many people here that will learn hard lessons about security, cost and value in the future.

How about the after-sale support? Firmware updates as security issues evolve? Not only is the Trezor hardware and software service superb, but the Trezor support and security updates are second to none.

I'm interested to hear why this may be.

No, I use bitrefill.com and it works perfect.

You can, but the threshold is unknown by the public. The principle is the same for firearms - you can buy and sell privately, but if you do "too much" without a license you'll go to prison.

Well, I didn't know this - I guess I should stop using it for my daily purchases and go back to fiat. And I suppose all those exchanges should shut down too.

Ok, you tell me what I just purchased with my BTC. I'll even give you a hint to give you a headstart - the payment came out of Darkwallet. 


This doesn't make any sense at all. 


And this is just crazy.
@_date: 2015-02-01 01:24:04


Yes, download Chrome and the DarkWallet plugin and you should be in good shape.

This is sorely needed - build this into iOS an Android apps and it'll take off quick, especially in developing countries.

I don't get why you guys just don't ignore this shit - it's not even a competitor to the Trezor, it just doesn't compete in the same market space.

I find it odd that this is repeated in this forum. I use it for almost every purchase - it's almost instant and doesn't require me to use the banking system (Americans can't bank overseas). It is a true *intra-national* currency the promotes strong financial responsibility.

Exactly why the project will probably need to be open-sourced and completely distributed.
