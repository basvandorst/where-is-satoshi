A handful of miners holding us all to ransom ?
But bitcoin is still decentralised right ?

Send some of your spare BTC to yourself, but with bare minimum, sub standard fees.
Actually, wallet creators could build this in, setting a absolute minimum Tx fee as standard. Sure, you'll have to wait, but if enough people did this, in order to get paid, the miners would eventually have to start accepting those transactions.  
Maybe we the little people can enforce lower fees rather than them enforcing higher fees.
we are not powerless, we just have to work together on a strategy.

I don't know much about Bitcoin's problems, there appears to be some sort of bottleneck.
How about some sort of add on to Apps, to create a sidechain network.
So developer A, who's building, let's say a AngryBirds app (for example) he adds in to his code, some extra code which handles in the background, some of BTC extra traffic, and he gets some of the fees.
By allowing anyone to incorporate code in to their apps, they can get paid, and help increase and secure the Bitcoin network.

Cruel, but yea, go on, give us a laugh.

Not your fault, the Wallet / Network shouldn't allow you to send a TX without enough Fees. If low fees are an option, then it's the Network or Wallet designers error.

I've had Txs take hours, (i'm stingy when it comes to fees) they usually go through.

Sounds promising, once implemented, will take the brakes off BTC, might make a good buying opportunity just before launch.
Thanks for the explanation.

I don't want it to confirm.
Otherwise I'll lose over $100 in transaction fees.
Can't understand why the miners haven't snapped it up already.
Maybe they're taking pity on me and allowing the transaction to fail.
My own fault of course, not paying attention.
I'll see what happens, put it down to experience.

Still not confirmed, well over 24 hrs later.
Thanks for the replies, something else I just noticed, is that some wallets I try to import the private key into tell me it's invalid.
Maybe that's why the network has not validated it.
I'll just have to wait and see what happens.
I've deleted the private key, (It's a brainwallet, so I can recover it) s the wallet does not keep rebroadasting.
If I et lucky and it's rejected, I'll have a go at consolidating the inputs. Thanks for the replies.

I still like shape shift, great service and innovation.  
@_date: 2017-06-04 04:43:57
What !!!!!!!
I want Bitcoin to plummet to around $1 so I can buy a few more.
@_date: 2017-06-04 04:28:02
Yea, volatility adds a little excitement to money.
@_date: 2017-06-04 04:37:04
Spread your risk, maybe look in to the top 5 or ten altcoins by market cap.
@_date: 2017-06-04 04:27:09
Great, now I'll be able to afford the transaction fees....no wait...
@_date: 2017-06-04 04:45:45
If Bitcoin is only doing around 7 transactions per second, then this price is purely speculative.
The actual real economy behind Bitcoin should have it on a price of $50 or less.
