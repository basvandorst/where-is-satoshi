Bitcoin is a fake currency and a bubble.

Anyone can go clone btc right now and create more on another blockchain.... Alt coins reveal this inflationary aspect.

Here is the other perspective....
I like kicking "buttcoiners" (bitcoin buyers) when price is down because it's been annoying to watch the market reward stupidity as it has done with btc.
I'm sure there is a plethora of investors like me who view btc as a bubble and who are aggravated by the hubris of naive dumb money who have latched onto a golden swan event and fancy themselves market gurus....coming to poke the buttcoiners when the price is down and saying "I told you so".

I think your screen is upside down.

Depends on what your cost of the position is.....

It works until it doesn't.

This only works when you aren't buying a dying asset.

What kind of currency loses 80% of its value in less than a year....?
There is not going to be mass adoption.... There was never going to be mass adoption..... Smart money pumped it, waited for the dumb money to enter in, and then they left it, and then once the euphoria died so did the interest of dumb money. All that's left are speculators playing both sides and bag holders who are capitulating one by one.
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:59:31
Yup... I like don't like seeing stupidity make money.
@_date: 2018-11-21 14:44:32
Where did you get half a million from?
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:55:33
Bitcoin is AOL.... Blockchain is the Internet.
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:52:04
No new money entering and bag holders capitulating
@_date: 2018-11-21 04:31:32
There is no adoption 
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:56:56
Markets don't reward stupidity forever.... 
@_date: 2018-11-21 04:56:54
It would still be $0.80 overvalued....

Btc hasn't changed.... Its perceived use/value has changed.
