The comment by Satoshi "It's been turned over to other people. They are in charge of it now. I no longer have any connection" does not sound like he was talking about his past engineering work in general, as he claims in the AP story. It sounds like he was talking about a specific project, like, say, bitcoin.

This is one reason why many people on r/bitcoin were so vicious toward Leah McGrath Goodman: Finding Satoshi Nakamoto would create a single point of attack for anti-bitcoin forces. Sexism in male-dominated bitcoinland probably played a role as well.

Andreas made it clear at all times that he had no inside information on Mt. Gox and was just speculating that its problems were due to incompetence and it would probably be back to normal soon. He was saying people should stay away from Mt. Gox at least since its problems circa $260. He never gives investment advice and has told me directly that all predictions about the future price of bitcoin are worthless, and he said it could be $2 tomorrow (when it was about to hit an all-time high). This is why we don't need any leaders in bitcoin. The fear mongers will try to smear whatever leaders emerge.

Bitcoiners, who were suddenly experts in journalism after Newsweek, don't understand that anonymous articles lack credibility.

That's the way I look at my mining rig too. I didn't make a profit in bitcoin terms, but it forced me to hold onto my bitcoins.

It sure is fun to fantasize about an astronomically high price. Even though all predictions about price are worthless, threads like this put me in a good mood.

I think when he is young and bitcoin is in the crapper (relatively speaking, but actually the best investment ever since its creation) is the perfect time to put a small amount into bitcoin every month. Saving in a 401(k) will end with confiscation of the 401(k) in exchange for Treasuries. Mark my words. And check how well this investment is performing in a year.

Just got the Associated Press subscription email newsletter "AP Stylebook Updates," and "bitcoin" has been added.
The stylebook is a reference book/website for journalists and editors.
I guess this means the AP thinks bitcoin will be in the news for a while.

I have already recouped in fiat my initial investment in bitcoin, and still have bitcoin that represent a 1500% gain on that initial investment. But because of Mt. Gox negative publicity, members of my family are suggesting that I cash out because it is too risky. I responded by showing a chart going back to 2009 and explaining all the past crashes and crises and the way the price keeps going up. Not sure I got through, but man, people are so easily frightened. What's not to like about a 1500% gain? Should I put the money in stocks instead? Sheesh.

Your assertion that a person starting out saving for retirement should stick to conservative investments is the opposite of conventional investment thinking. It is while you are young that you can afford to take risks with a high upside.

Here's their definition:
bitcoin - A digital currency created and exchanged independent of banks or governments. The currency can be converted into cash when deposited into accounts at prices set in online trading. Lowercase in all uses.

In a court of law, yes. But we are talking about logic here, not a trial.

Bitcoiners are used to large price drops. And to rearm themselves for another such attack, the government would have to buy bitcoin again.

Newsweek writer Leah McGrath Goodman, who spent two months researching the story, told the AP: "I stand completely by my exchange with Mr. Nakamoto. There was no confusion whatsoever about the context of our conversation -- and his acknowledgment of his involvement in Bitcoin."
I tend to believe her.

What if the business decides not to "invest" its profits at all, but instead to keep them in bitcoin. Where is this expressly prohibited?

It is interesting to watch the despair phase in this subreddit. Things are truly negative these days. As an earlier adopter, I can watch it with some detachment. (As a late entrant into the last bull market in gold, I have experienced seeing my investments lose value and felt that pain too.) But with bitcoin, we are witnessing a network effect, which makes exponential growth normal, as argued in this oldie but goodie video.

Would that be the pre-order mess in which we pre-ordered and paid you, you kept our machines and mined with them while the reward was still high, and then shipped them to us when there was almost no money left to be made?
