Yes. Bitcoin is Digital Gold, aka Gold 2.0, aka Ideal Money since it's ideal unit of account and store of value.

Why there aren't bids from the issuer in the order book?
@_date: 2015-05-18 07:22:14


Why are you so sure about it?
@_date: 2014-05-12 05:56:34
I also just recently started to run a full node on one of my 24/7 servers. It's currently at around 40 connected nodes :)
I'm doing this to serve the network. &lt;3

@_date: 2015-05-18 07:38:16
Yes I can see that there are bids and asks.
There aren't however ANY bids from the issuer. Why is this?

I wonder what they discussed on that meeting, lot of relevant people at the same table, anyhow.
@_date: 2017-02-23 19:27:59
Yup, last meeting, on the 30th of August 2016 and they were able to release the memo on the same day as the meeting was held:
@_date: 2017-02-23 18:17:35
Yup, the BTC was at about 975 usd at the time of the meeting...

Which "bitcoin etf" traded on pink sheets did SEC halt?
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:02:50
The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing, under normal circumstances, in U.S. exchange-traded bitcoin-linked derivative instruments ("Bitcoin Instruments") and pooled investment vehicles and exchange-traded products that provide exposure to bitcoin (together with Bitcoin Instruments, "Bitcoin Investments").
 
The Fund is an actively managed exchange-traded fund ("ETF") and should not be confused with one that is designed to track the performance of a specified index.
@_date: 2017-08-26 17:33:23
10k when the ledgerX exchange kicks in next month.
20-40k when the ETF is approved for NYSE.
@_date: 2017-08-12 06:07:56
This kind of an app for all the financial instruments would be super awesome. 
Thx for making if for the cryptos.

What is the best way to move bitcoins from a paper wallet to a hardware wallet?

With all the time, money, development effort, brain-resources and regulation invested into Bitcoin, I am fairly sure that there won't ever be another &gt;&gt;major&gt;&gt; blockchain to overrule it. 
Seriously, all the best minds are working on Bitcoin, other chains have scarcely maybe 1-2 smart people working on them. It is not enough.

How about replacing the dice roll with user interaction, for example the last decimal of the time interval between user pressing the buttons?
@_date: 2015-04-24 15:24:55
Never, it seems

I did find couple while there were no GPU miners. Now that I think it I should have done it a little longer than just the couple days.

This is by far the coolest thing I've seen in a very long time. Thanks :)

Sorry, I misread your original message (where/when).
I don't know in which exchanges said options would be listed on.
@_date: 2015-03-22 08:15:59
For Russian government policy this is suitable:
Kleptocracy, alternatively cleptocracy or kleptarchy, (from Greek: κλέπτης - kleptēs, "thief"[1] and κράτος - kratos, "power, rule",[2] hence "rule by thieves") is a form of political and government corruption where the government exists to increase the personal wealth and political power of its officials and the ruling class at the expense of the wider population, often with pretense of honest service.

Bitcoin may very well do for money what Internet did for information. It liberates you from the controlling institutions and brings you the many joys of a technological advancement.
