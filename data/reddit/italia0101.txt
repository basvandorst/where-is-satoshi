@_date: 2017-12-21 13:48:17
Lol trash 
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:50:26
lol you're asking questions no one knows the answer to dude, 
" is it almost at its max value "  i mean this is just funny 
We dont know , its a gamble, it might be at its max right now , tomorrow or the next day , 
it might be at 0.5% of its max value ... it might crash to nothing in a week .
We dont know, dont look for someone to tell you here because as i've said , we dont know, its speculation 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:28:42
buy some more probably... but i have a problem
also stop orders.
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:48:00
this should clear it up a bit, 
Also you dont have to convert to euros drom GBP once its on coinbase .. i just tried sending £9 to revolut from my GBP wallet , it auto converts to Euro and sends to revolut
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:26:54
its not 12 million.. he has 1 million apparently 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:52:25
Yea , just kinda blows it doens't show you before you buy now :( 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:10:58
incoming DIP
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:06:37
Because you won't be able to do it "instantaneously" at all
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:17:33
yea its ass , i tried all day , didn't work, then tried it next day and worked straight away . bitcoin world just going nuts atm , no one can keep up 
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:45:08
I mean, short term yea you messed up... Long term? Possibly you're still super early to the party 
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:39:48
"make love to your wife "

@_date: 2017-12-01 22:54:45
No sir, YOU don't understand bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:10:49
One days ATH ( all time high) is another days dip. Invest it now! 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:26:12
when you started that week... that was now a dip... mind blown.
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:29:09
Meh, complaints but not solutions 
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:16:24
Sounds scammy 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:26:15
well ... people said it was too late to invest at 
and now 16k 
we dont know, this train could crash in the next minute , or it could go up another 6k .. 
point is you may still be super early to the party ... or not. its a gamble at this point, if you believe in the technology and the vision i'd say invest, if you're doing it to make you rich quick.. not so much
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:50:59
100k dayum., you like to live dangerously 
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:26:49
I feel your pain... in the exact same boat, sent mine Saturday as well although i don't believe Revolut did anything about it till Monday 
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:46:07
Because futures is coming 
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:32:40
Translation - where can I get rich 
@_date: 2017-12-31 11:36:11
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:59:52
Lol ,  sure, if you can afford it, just don't blame everyone if it drops tomorrow 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:02:48

@_date: 2017-12-22 09:55:39

@_date: 2017-12-05 20:36:04
Maybe... Or maybe you just messed up. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:41:18

@_date: 2017-12-21 08:29:50
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:40:51
no just you..... of course people are lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:28:11
unfortunatly i already have it ... just to let you know you can't send bitcoin to revolut or take it out of revolut just yet 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:28:52
oops indeed.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:08:46
Bitcoin baby, sometimes it just spins in circles 
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:12:17
O sure... Oh wait nah , no thanks 
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:02:05
Nah takes longer than a day 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:50:46
nah that's not right, should be around 0.003 ish or something like that
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:06:14
No one knows.  If you're looking for short term gain id stay away. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:13:46
Tell us something we don't know 
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:57:39
rolling downhill atm
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:14:15
You won't get rich, you already sound like you have wet hands 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:37:51
Perfect example of why we need bitcoin to work 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:23:51
Revolut? Nah they are fine, been using them for a while 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:24:43
Good point, i agree, the fees are a killer ,
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:14:44
18 k in 10 seconds LOL
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:50:14
Get your point , but the UKs £ is worth a lot, 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:27:31
people can protect themselves with stop orders...
@_date: 2017-12-28 09:18:59
Gdax better 
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:05:02
Wall o text. Get the feeling you like the sound of your own voice.

@_date: 2017-12-07 16:20:27
$20 ? yea fuck it 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:34:40
Lol Yea, there's a fair few people that think it may see a dip on the 10th ( futures ) or the 18th ( CME ) ... one things for sure, its either going up or down lol.
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:06:33
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:40:48
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:50:38
How long did it take? 
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:27:34
It's worth.. Maybe. It's a risk, only invest if you can afford to lose it
Is it too late? Maybe, maybe not, no one really knows, just speculation.
There is a chance you're still super early to the party. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:45:58
Afaik you can't load them to the wallet there can you? Just buy from them then it's there but can't take out 
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:49:16
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:59:50
Revolut does work, are you sure you activated the euro wallet correctly? There's a few steps
Open revolut
Click settings in the corner
Go to euro
Then turn it on 
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:19:27
Revisit this post in 5 years , you'll shoot yourself lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:45:57

@_date: 2017-12-04 14:11:23
For a newbie use Coinbase, it's easy, has a good ui etc , hte fees are high, but it's a very easy way to get going at least.

@_date: 2017-12-25 10:14:36
"Coinbase is a piece of shit company"
Proceeds to recommend gdax lol
They the same company 
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:46:25
In 8 hours this coin will be a shitcoin .... I'm kidding btw
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:45:49
Are you using 2fa.. Shouldn't be another fee
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:55:40
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:32:54
i was wrong... its going up..TO THE MOON
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:51:38
I'm going out too, to the bank to get my fiat money to buy bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:39:21
its called arbitrage ... yea people do it BUT , its not as easy as you think,  the time it takes to move the bitcoin around can be quite long.. you may lose out , not to mention fees, withdrawl / deposit fees etc
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:52:25
Its so true, last night i woke up at 2am to check the price.... i have a serious problem
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:37:05
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:05:13
Yea , takes a while at the moment, how much did you do as the fee? if too small it'll take ages
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:07:04
"hard" lol 300-500 is not hard at all
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:48:53
That was stupid,  if you're freaking out take some out. If you can't afford to lose it take some out! 
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:39:21
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:09:17

@_date: 2017-12-22 11:11:57
tell us something we don't know
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:10:45
Electrum is where I moved to
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:44:50
Because you can use gdax with Coinbase which also has no fee 
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:01:30
Hodl, tie your hands up if they're weak 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:21:14

@_date: 2017-12-07 14:43:34
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:43:57
If you can afford to lose it.... Otherwise do not do it. No one knows where it's going, it's speculation. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:30:09

@_date: 2017-12-22 10:06:24

@_date: 2017-12-17 13:50:48
Tbh it's really easy to understand? They worried they might lose everything so sell sell sell. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:05:45
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:24:45
It's over 9000!!!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:29:11
Do not put all your savings into this...
Seriously, how would you feel if you woke up and bitcoin was worth nothing, your 10k? Zip nada. Gone. ...
For me that's the perfect test or what your OK to lose 
 Don't be silly, only invest what you would be OK with losing.
Don't get into this to "get rich quick" 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:33:38
Nah. good try though
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:10:03
Gtfo, all you have achieved is everyone here now hates you 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:17:51
yea its probably too fast.... maybe ... 
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:40:31
Might see a correction.prrtty soon... Then again might not 
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:16:02
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:14:58
If you have a high fee , not very long at all , depends on the fee
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:21:10
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:39:47
If you did you were dumb 
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:56:51

@_date: 2017-12-07 16:01:58
also true
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:13:01
depends on the fee?  if you didn't put enough it might never get done with the current volume
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:47:46
Just buy it outright? or manage to trade up 
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:37:08
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:08:27
It's a fee for the transaction yeah
