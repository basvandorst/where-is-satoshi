"Internet: miss-attributing shitty quotes that don't make any sense." - Abraham Lincoln
Doing the same thing over and over and recording the results is literally what the scientific method looks like in practice.

Bitcoin cold storage is a very relevant example of security by obscurity. Someone COULD break into your house and steal your thumb drive, but it's a lot less likely.

You did mix up the order. You generally want a hypothesis before beginning an experiment. Your goal during the experiment should be to invalidate the hypothesis, and if you fail, then your hypothesis is more likely to become a theory after further study.

They say security by obscurity is not security, but I think that's bs. No matter how careful you are, you wouldn't stand a chance against a nation state level attack. The only way to keep technology secure is to just... not use it much. For your daily drivers, assume you're already compromised in some way.

This is barely even a legible sentence. It sounds like something I might have put in an essay when I was 13. Please wait a few more years before forming strong opinions, tia

p hacking and the source of funding for science is the problem. The scientific method is not the problem. The scientific method has remained largely unchanged for thousands of years.

What if I look back and all I see is work I didn't want to do? What if money would give me the opportunity to actually do things?

This one gets the wall.

So basically what you're saying is that you spent the best years of your life working, and now that you're older, you can't enjoy it as much? How is this supposed to be encouraging?

Jobs are a catastrophic drain on our society and they're destroying our planet.
Work is good. Making the world better is good.
Jobs are capitalists stealing your productivity to make money for themselves.

Not exactly. Inflation is driven by an increase in the supply of money. A central government causes inflation by literally just giving themselves money. It devalues the currency, but increases their share of the total.

Fedora 25 under the hood. But what you're looking at is a tiling window manager called i3wm, which can be used with just about any *nix distro.

I've never used this option before. Good to know it's there though. I'll likely play around with it in the future.
And I'm not on a VPN. It turns green when I am on a VPN. Don't want to accidentally route my porn viewing through the datacenter.

I dare anyone to reverse this. I don't think it's possible. If you use a single bitmap filter, I can see how that works. This... not a chance.
And for their consolation, they'd get my bank account balances and the last 4 digits of the account numbers.

I'm kinda pissed that given any time period in the last half decade, the right choice would literally have just been to buy as much as possible. I got started way too late.
@_date: 2017-01-19 23:50:36
How about "There are no great minds."?
@_date: 2017-01-06 20:30:17
It's kinda the same mechanism as fiat currency. We're all going to die after a finite amount of time, which makes time a scarce resource. We trade time off our lives for money, and then use the money to trade value. So in effect, the value of bitcoin stands in directly for time on your life.
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:28:47
Yeah, I gave up on day trading when I realized I was underperforming the market. Still hard to not watch it.
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:22:19
I should have known better than to buy on a Sunday night. Down $700. Oh well, is what it is. I like the volatility, as long as it goes back up.
@_date: 2017-08-14 02:28:20
Today might have been a bad day. Then again, starting on any "bad day" in the last half decade would have worked out just fine so vOv
@_date: 2017-08-14 14:24:18
Truth is I would've gotten into cryptocurrencies a long time ago, but I was starving for most of the last decade. Oh well. Opportunity cost and all that.

Man, if you could have timed that right: bch -&gt; btc -&gt; bch, you could have just cleared like 100% in 15 minutes.

In the IT industry, 1 in 10 people does 10x the work of the other 9. It's a well known trend, and that 1 in 10 person gets headhunted by everybody.
Being one of those 1 in 10, I can honestly say it's not that I'm particularly talented. I'm actually kinda dumb. But everyone else is just so god awful.

No, you're right. It's the other way around. He's rich because he's got no qualms about taking people for all they're worth.
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:17:18
Yeah, that was an exaggeration. Half-a-decade in and out of prison would be more accurate.
