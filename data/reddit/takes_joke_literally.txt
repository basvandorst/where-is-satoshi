I studied charts for trends of price and volumes, considered externalities which may have contributed to those trends such as governmental policies, opening of futures markets, directly pertinent news events such as the coinbase scandal and bitcoin cash issue, lightning, segwit, alts, seasonal trends, etc... then went with my gut on nailing down a prediction with a price and timeline.

I guess I'll stop buying insurance then since it's so unlikely things will ever happen.  In fact, let's stop considering the possibility of outside chances altogether.  I mean, why even look both ways before crossing the street?  I *probably* won't get hit.

If they're completely arbitrary it means they're not based on anything. 
Are you trying to answer your own question, or do you really want an answer?
Sounds like you went into this with a confirmation bias and don't really want to think thoughts you didn't already think.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:46:47
We're all guessing, mang.  A guess isn't wrong until it is or isn't.

My expert prediction on record: the floor of this crash is at ~$6100.
It should occur about 19 days from now. (Monday Feb 5 is the beginning of the bounce)
Let's see if I'm right.

wouldn't *we* be stupid to reduce an entire human being to this hasty evaluation based on a news clip with no context or background?

The contraction *it's* is just that; a contraction which combines two words.  In the case of *it's*, it is usually combining *it is* or *it has*.
The way you've used it to show possession is incorrect.  The possessive word *its* does not need an apostrophe, just like how "his, hers, ours, theirs, yours, etc." don't need one.
Do you see how I was able to interact with you just now without my first words being hateful and belligerent? Try that.

Come on, Sam.  You think there's a fixed percentage for "a young investor"?  There's the concept of tolerance for risk, to start with.  Do you have income? Assets? Liabilities? Other things worth considering?
You need to budget what you need to survive, and then see what's left over and be smart about what you do with it.  NOBODY knows exactly what bitcoin or anything else is going to do.  So, don't gamble more than you can afford to lose, hope for the best, prepare for the worst, and be an awesome person of substance in the meantime.

The wife decided that we're gonna HODL.  I was gonna do that anyway, but the way she said it made me wanna say "I'll do what I want! You're not the boss of me!" (who am I kidding though, she is)

I literally think I installed "Bitcoin Wallet".  It appears as an option on bitcoin.org just like Mycelium or breadwallet... 
 
@_date: 2017-08-07 14:53:02
Okay, I'll look into that...
In the meantime: is the "BTC Wallet" i see my coins in on Coinbase the same as "Bitcoin Wallet" that I downloaded from bitcoin.org?  Should these accounts be linkable?  if not linked/linkable, can I xFer from the coinbase one to the app to store on my phone?
@_date: 2017-08-07 14:45:15
And yes, it appears they are just in Coinbase, is there a way to transfer them to the phone?

What does SPEDN mean, though?  HODL is an initialism which represents "Hold On for Dear Life".  It's not just a cutesy transposition of consonants...

I was about to install bitcoin core, but it is gonna download 240GB of blockchain? Does every wallet require the 240GB blockchain to be installed on the device?  That's more space than I want to devote. I originally had the bitcoin wallet app on my phone.

If you like smoking grass, you should try smoking marijuana.  still green and natural, but it gets you high, too!

It wasn't the beginning of an upward surge, but actual I was [dead-on]( regarding the "floor of the crash"
we all wanted it to bounce to the moon the next day, but good things are worth waiting for.
