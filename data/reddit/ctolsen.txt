Totally agree – sorry for perhaps repeating the obvious. I think the furthest you can go is saying they both have their roots in antiauthoritarian movements and that the groups involved, while agreeing on some things, in the end took different paths towards that goal.

There are commonalities between classical liberalism and socialism though, and workers and peasants have played important roles in the development of classical liberalism. I guess you could say they were only linked insofar as they both wanted to democratise authority, but that liberalism got off the train before we were talking about democratisation of wealth and production.
But I will say that there are groups important to liberal reform, such as French physiocracy, British radicals, and so on, that were also important in the later development of socialism.

Or wire transfer, which dwarfs any other method of transfer in total sums. Unless he meant consumer transactions.

Could be many reasons for dropping a charge like that. First of all, the evidence could become inadmissible because of a technicality DPR's lawyers found. Bureaucratic glitch in getting the warrant, say – it's still inadmissible even though it's not fabricated.
Otherwise, they might think that it's hard to get a conviction on it right now, or that it's easier to sail through a conviction on other stuff then charge him with the attempted murder later.

There's nothing in the indictment that supports that, after a quick skim. They figured out the location of the server which you can do in a host of different ways, and took it from there.

It's also a tiny country – I went there for a month once and ended up meeting the PM and a minister randomly in a restaurant on separate occasions. 
They don't have much to lose either, they're friendly to offshore banking and are likely seeing this as an experiment in staying that way.
Lovely country, too. Absolutely one of the most beautiful places on the planet.

Screen readers use information from the UI library to prioritise as well. Far from all the information on the screen is relevant, and you can't do that with pure text. Although I'm sure ncurses and the like have accessibility features.

No, they're not. They sometimes want you to applaud on cue, such as when going to commercial, that's all.
But you are well warmed up by a stand-up comic and Jon himself before the show. Things get a lot funnier then.

While this guy is the definition of "against us" for the government, this seizure and arrest was done pretty much within the realms of laws as they should be. They located the server, got information from the company, and figured out who he was. No waterboarding required.

There is a chance that some of these people don't share your ideas and think they're supporting a system they find reasonable, you know. We could have a discussion about people projecting their power onto others, but I'm pretty sure that I could find a big proportion of the populace who would actively choose government as is if given the opportunity.

Also, I fail to understand what technology has to do with this. I couldn't buy disability insurance privately before the blockchain was invented?

Gold has a certain value as a tangible commodity, if not just because it's nice and shiny, also because it's been like that for a long time. If Bitcoins aren't used they will basically be a weird financial derivative with no real backing.

Ketamine is being heavily researched for its antidepressant properties even though it's controlled. Biggest problem right now is it's not turning out as great as it looked like for a bit.

What, no. This is not how any of this works. Using Tor is not illegal. Owning a marketplace set up with the *intention* – important word – of letting other trade illegal goods, on the other hand, is.
Tor was created by the goddamn Navy.

It's a clear indication that selling drugs is against the law. What were authorities going to do when Silk Road popped up, sit and watch?
I'm glad we have these markets, and they will never go away, but the government wouldn't suddenly just go "Oh, drugs are being sold online now, that's exactly what we've been waiting for! Call off the dogs!"
If anything, the enforcement of these markets could have been a lot harsher, had it been on the same terms as the rest of the War on Drugs. Ulbricht wasn't hit with a single bullet or flashbang.
@_date: 2015-02-05 15:49:06
That's not what happened though. What happened was that the government found some information on servers they searched, but the servers could technically be absolutely anyone's. DPR could have claimed ownership of them and had standing to challenge the search.
Your neighbour, depending on circumstance, would possibly have standing to challenge the search without claiming the guns, especially if the storage in question was with your permission. It depends on the circumstances though.

It's not really a single source – it's the fact that studies are generally small, and the fact that it's incredibly hard to test against placebo when you're using a drug that so clearly makes you high. Research has also generally tested on shorter periods of time.
Keeping all that in mind, the results aren't in any way mind-blowing. It might be a useful treatment, it might not. It might end up being emergency medicine for depression, which is great to have, but not living up to its promise. 
Only more research can tell us all that, and we'll have answers in a couple of years.
@_date: 2015-02-18 21:57:55
Oh come on. I get that people are against how the laws are, but you're saying offering a marketplace where people can buy and sell drugs is legal and the proceeds and escrow from that activity is fair game.
Of course it's bloody illegal, what the hell. It doesn't matter if something was to be used for rolling paper, the market was intentionally set up for illegal activities. I'd like to see anyone argue differently in court.
@_date: 2015-02-18 21:53:15
If it were stocks – like governments around the world are sitting on in huge quantities after bank bailouts – they would have made a public tender for selling them, and basically hired someone to ease them into the market.
I guess there are no institutions that would be able to handle this for bitcoin in a satisfactory manner yet. There would be a lot of due diligence involved. Can't say I blame them, given how many exchanges have fared, and I don't think it's reasonable that they should retain the competence to do it themselves.
Or it could just be how the Marshals treat seized property in general.

There are many drugs with proven benefits and widespread medical use on the controlled substances list.
@_date: 2015-02-11 22:45:42
...to see widespread medical use they've had to go through a few hoops to get there, so they've had those trials aplenty. Not to mention that ketamine is a heavily researched drug these days.
I'd agree it's much more difficult in terms of psychedelics, although that's almost as much the fault of the research community leaving it behind as the government making it hard.

I meant that saying he is relevant to economics isn't true for all he does, as in this context he's a political thinker. 
The fact that he didn't actually say what's on the picture makes it even less relevant for this sub.

Because it would be insane and unsustainable if you could take the government to court over them illegally searching someone else's property. You need [standing]( to challenge something.
