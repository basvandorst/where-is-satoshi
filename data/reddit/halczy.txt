FXBTC Announcement
Today, FXBTC, like many of Bitcoin exchanges in China, received multiple phone calls from our banks asking us to cancel our accounts with them. Their reason is that the PBOC has ask them to enforce their regulations regarding Bitcoin. Some of the banks even ask us to cancel our accounts no later than tomorrow. FXBTC here confirms those are not rumors, PBOC had indeed sent out memos to banks and third-party payment processing companies, asking them to terminate their business relationships with Bitcoin related companies. FXBTC hope to keep serving our customers. However, since the banks gave us the ultimatum to either cancel our accounts soon or have our asset frozen. We had to made the following difficult decisions
Starting on April 3rd, we will no longer process CNY deposits. Also, we will no longer process CNY withdraws as well after this Sunday (April 6th). We have not receive any message from CaiFuTong (third-party payment processor). Therefore, you can continue to use CaiFuTong to deposit and withdraw for now. We regret these decisions and we are deeply sorry.

OKCoin Announcement
Dear OKCoin Customers,
We were just notified by our third-party payment processors that they need to temporarily suspend their services with us. OKCoin will stop processing deposits via recharge-codes. Direct bank deposits and withdraws are not effected. We are sorry about the inconvenience.

The recharge codes mentioned above are like BTC-e codes. You can buy them through 3rd parties and it is faster than bank transfers.
