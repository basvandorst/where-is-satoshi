Bitcoin may not be at fault, but there are *hundreds* of altcoins that can still be GPU-mined (and some that claim to be "ASIC-resistant", therefore always able to be mined with a GPU in theory). Graphics card prices aren't dropping anytime soon.

How could people not have heard of it? Anyone who has been on Coinbase within the past few days would have noticed that they now have a fourth currency for sale.

DuckDuckGo FTW
Shame there isn't an equivalent YouTube alternative... (Nor a good Android alternative. \*sigh*)

Waze is owned by Google 
@_date: 2018-09-26 07:25:09
I seriously doubt DDG gets its results from Google cause they're often *way* different than Google's even when searching for the exact same term.

I'm putting half. I make minimum wage, so even if bitcoin collapses and I lose everything, it won't ruin me because it wasn't a whole lot of money to begin with...
@_date: 2018-09-28 04:22:27
Yeah but now they're making 10nm ones. Better efficiency = bigger gains. 
@_date: 2018-08-13 20:31:56
SegWhat? 
@_date: 2018-08-06 23:43:19
It's literally in the first tab (General). Check the box that says "Temporarily set top-level sites to TRUSTED". 
@_date: 2018-08-06 22:03:43
It's not so bad once you've used it for awhile and have a good chunk of safe scripts enabled. Also, you can set it to always allow scripts originating from the TLD itself, which is good enough for many sites to be functional without doing any shady background shit.

Psychedelics have been proven to help form new connections in the brain, so basically they traded BTC for *more* brain cells.

BITCOIN IS DYING SELL YOUR HOUSE 
@_date: 2018-10-25 21:16:14
Except which has been unsurprisingly quiet lately. 
@_date: 2018-10-15 10:02:21
Remember when everyone lost their collective shit when Bitcoin hit a massive $500?
Pepperidge Farms remembers.

How? Can I run one part time on my regular PC or do I need to dedicate a server to it? 
@_date: 2018-06-27 18:46:23
No. 
@_date: 2018-06-19 19:56:25
No you'd have to use a satellite connection, and the latency would be unbearable. 
@_date: 2018-06-02 20:22:17
But I don't know of anything I can spend it on that isn't drugs, and I don't want any drugs right now. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 20:06:28
Won't that eat up all my data when I'm not on wifi and drain my battery? Or are you talking about buying a cheap used tablet and turning it into a dedicated server? 
@_date: 2018-06-24 19:53:32
You don't normally have auto rotate toggled off? It doesn't annoy you when your phone rotates when you didn't want it to? 
@_date: 2019-08-24 15:42:41
I've always used Coinbase. It's easy, convenient, and instant; never had an issue.
@_date: 2018-06-19 04:14:25
Bought when it first hit 10k. Feels bad, man. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 19:26:27
¿Por qué no los dos? 
@_date: 2018-06-19 19:55:39
Will a node work on a satellite connection? Do bitcoin transactions care about latency? 
@_date: 2019-10-04 14:52:36
Sorry to disappoint, but it's actually a BMW with Supra badges.
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:18:55
What's the catch?
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:24:04
No. More coin for me.
@_date: 2019-12-23 16:40:18
Then what *can* we do to support it?
@_date: 2019-12-31 03:09:36
It frustrates me that Bill didn't emphasize the importance of that fact that you can get information from anywhere in the world at any time.
@_date: 2019-12-23 19:12:30
I'm already doing that, though. I want to help a little more.
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:27:07
There are also smartwatches that run on Android if you want something a bit more stylish.
@_date: 2019-04-19 20:04:39
It's been great since Vista, problem is that most people with the OS were running it on low budget, pre-built trash PCs.
@_date: 2018-11-05 18:14:15
Yeah well we're in 2018 now. 
@_date: 2018-11-09 12:36:08
no u

IDK I posted that comment from mobile. If I hold down the equals sign it gives me a not equal option. (SwiftKey keyboard) 
@_date: 2018-11-08 19:43:05
Jesus christ people, learn how to type this: ≠
@_date: 2018-11-08 20:54:18
Then copy and paste like I do. It takes two seconds to Google "not equal sign" 
@_date: 2017-09-28 00:16:23
Yes. Buy now.
@_date: 2017-09-04 19:58:26
Because it hasn't hit the mainstream yet, but has a lot of potential. If Bitcoin becomes wildly accepted, you can expect to see quite a few young millionaires pop up out of nowhere the day that happens.
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:25:47
Why shouldn't you buy your coin on Coinbase? I do so with a credit card all the time and have never had any issues. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:23:41
It's actually a lot easier than it sounds. Once you've set up your account and linked it with your bank, buying coin is quicker than buying something off of Amazon. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:54:30
I've seen that video before but all it did is make me understand things even *less*. 
Anyway, are you going to translate your comment or not?
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:37:25
What's Electrum's policy? I'm new to this as well and this is the only wallet I'm comfortable with. (Well, new-ish. First bought coin back in 2014.)
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:38:00
Can you translate this to English, please?
@_date: 2018-07-22 18:41:53
Yeah seriously if you can provide a valid ID then you might as well just use Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:27:55
Have an offsite backup too just in case your house burns down. Or just memorize it. 
@_date: 2018-07-22 18:42:39
1-3% is reasonable, anything more isn't. 
@_date: 2018-07-22 20:24:22
Yup it's the same amount credit card machine vendors charge. 
@_date: 2019-05-01 20:09:39
I don't even know how to interpret this data
@_date: 2019-05-03 05:43:33
Awesome, man. You didn't have to do that just for me.
