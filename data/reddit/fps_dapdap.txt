When you say “just want to use it for bitcoin” does that imply that you could turn it off/on? Meaning whenever I use GADX or any other exchange then I would “turn on” linux and all other times I would just be using Windows?

Thanks for all the info! A few questions:
Is it one or the other? Run linux or reinstall windows?
For running linux, is the “USB” method the best?
For reinstalling windows, you stated earlier to do this before you start using the laptop. Did you literally mean before you use it at all? Or is it okay to download the Windows 10 media creation tool on the new laptop and then perform the reinstillation?
You have been extremely helpful. I really appreciate it.

Okay Rick.

Side question: does it matter that my new laptop has a solid state drive rather than a hard drive?

Wow this is a shit ton of info. I’ll be deciphering this once I get off of work. Thanks!

Thanks for the reply! I have see a lot of people talk about running a USB version of linux. Sorry if this is technically an “incorrect” statement as I am not familiar with this process. How difficult is it to do this? And could you point me in the right direction to a step-by-step guide?
Also, how does one go about “reinstalling” windows on a brand new computer? Not sure if this is a difficult process either. I apologize for the noon questions. Just trying to gather as much information/research as possible.
