How can you be so definitely against Bitcoin? I believe in it personally, but I'm not ignoring the possibility that it does die. Life isn't so black and white. No need to get sarcastic and mock people for having a different opinion than you.

I did for a few months. Don't really keep up with the price much anymore. I'm not planning to sell for quite some time anyways, so I don't really care how it changes short term.

Unless I end up in desperate need for money, I don't really ever plan on selling off all of my btc. I'll withdraw some as my investment goes up in value, but I'm definitely a long term believer of bitcoin.

Manipulators are being investigated, so manipulators AKA whales are dumping and exiting BTC, hence the recent steep drop in price. That leads to lower, more stable prices, enticing big money to join the party and creating more trust in the future of BTC. Incoming mass adoption and moon. Buckle in, boys. Rocket is leaving soon. 
This may seem bad short term, but this is just what we needed. This is progress!

I remember hearing about it being up to like $700 some years ago. It was on an article about silk road. I was too young to think about investing or the bigger picture of Bitcoin back then. I never thought twice about it until the past 6 months.

According to  there is $1.63t USD in circulation. It's interesting to imagine that there would be over 10x the value in Bitcoin compared to tangible USD.

If nobody would sell, then there wouldn't be a price. The price is 100% dependant on supply and demand. Bitcoin would be a million dollars each if people were willing to buy for that price and other people were willing to sell for that price.

I don't necessarily think it's either. I think we came down from a very unorganic, overbought high of nearly $20k, and we're been searching for an accurate price for bitcoin. Adoption is great, but unless something phenomenally positive happens for bitcoin, I expect a slow climb up from the bottom we find. There may be sudden periods of quick growth through our climb, but mass adoption generally won't happen overnight. 
@_date: 2018-06-21 20:46:55

If you have .5btc, you don't have half of somebody else's btc. You simply have .5btc. Think of it this way, the base unit is a Satoshi. If you have 100,000,000 Satoshis, then it is considered one Bitcoin. Compare it to fiat. If you sell your neighbor your gaming PC for $1,000, you wouldn't receive a "whole grand", it would be one thousand dollars that would be considered a grand.
@_date: 2018-06-26 16:48:47
How do you compare the rarity of something without mass (bitcoin) to the physical objects of gold and diamonds? Bitcoin also isn't perfect by any means, as everything has their flaws. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of bitcoin, but I can't take this post seriously. 
Also, there's not 21 million bitcoin yet, nor will there ever be due to permanently lost coins.

You're right, but think about how little the steps really are in the grand scheme. I mean it's not like we've seen Amazon or Walmart or Costco start accepting crypto. A jewelry store accepting them and more BTMs popping up is great, but it's just a drop in the bucket. Most people still know a very minimal amount about crypto.
