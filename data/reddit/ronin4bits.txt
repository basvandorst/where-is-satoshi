Well, now, that's just the kind of logic that won't go anywhere when corrupt lawmakers get involved...
As far as I understand the charges, he had no idea who anyone was he was transacting with. Acting as a money service broker without license and ignoring "know your customer" regulations, to boot.
I'm in your side that this is lopsided and corrupt--a shining example of the dual justice system we now have in America. Sad...

Why is their shopping cart still running? You'd think someone in the courts would make turning that off a priority...

Ok, Dude, if I may call you that... when they buy bitcoin from me and send USD to my bank, what do you call that? Get a clue.
Any way, there's CampBX too.

Why so angry, man? Why so mean about what you "think" you know about me, my investments, or my technical and/or educational background.
At least I can speak, write and understand English... Someone that fancies themselves a dictator would be demanding draconian regulation (that's you) instead of supporting a system that requires caveat emptor (that's me).
Have you tried support -- they've always responded relatively soon if I have a legitimate question about a transaction, my balance, etc... I've used Coinbase for almost 2 years and have never had one problem. I'm fully documented, well funded and not shady.
You...?? Well, maybe not so much on any of that "legitimacy" stuff, huh?
Personally, I like that they cancel transactions on shady idiots, like you...

The author says "people want a currency with a stable value." He doesn't have you on that one.  I would like him to show us any one that (currently) is...  Buying power of the USD has eroded over 97% since our current centralized bank took over. This author is a propagadist idiot.

You can do instant with Coinbase, if you're willing to give them a bunch of personal info and put a credit card on file--then you can buy small amounts instantly.

There's no financial intermediary involved in Bitcoin transactions, i.e. no one to reverse a transaction for you if you send money to a bogus merchant, or otherwise get ripped off by someone. The pro of this is that there's no "Mastercard" or "Visa" involved charging everyone 2-3+ % for doing this, so it's cheaper to move money; the con is that these companies aren't in the middle of things inflating prices to provide this protection. 
If you need a university professor (or Reddit) to explain this to you,  perhaps you should heed the advice...
tl/dr If you get ripped off in a bitcoin transaction, Visa won't be there to protect the consumer...

Coinbase let's you send right to an email address and will walk them through getting their online wallet setup to claim it. I know a lot of people bash them, but I've never had a problem...
You could also do a btc-e code, but that's a little more complicated and their even shadier, imo

Government compulsion would be one very big reason why any (US-based) ISP might care. Like it or not, they are a choke point for information. This is why winning the net neutrality fight is important.  You're right that they can be circumvented, but there's definitely other reasons to think they might play a role aside from whether or not they accept it.

Seriously can't even believe I'm debating this with you...
If I was in the business of buying and selling bitcoin, per the Unites States Internal Revenue Service, then yes, that would make me an exchange -- a regulated MSB.
Ask anyone selling large amounts of btc on localbitcoins how your argument holds up with the Feds.
You are wrong here.

You mean you want the Federal Reserve System...??

Do.you listen to yourself? You are right... you can only buy at the ask and sell at the bid. That's right...
Stop insulting me. You have no idea who I am or what I know about exchanges.
I do know you just defined one for me.

Half of the world doesn't use Apple-anything. Just my opinion, but I see this as good for Bitcoin, as it furthers the concept of mobile payments as a whole for the mainstream user.

Anonymous sources and lots of speculation about who's responsible for the attacks... Not saying this didn't happen, but this is a lot of "hearsay as news" atm.
Maybe one of the reputable independent news sources will vet the facts before the entire American public gets on the Bloomberg/msm "let's bomb Russia" bandwagon. I can't wait for a real journalism outlet to get to the bottom of this for us.

I'm in VA and would pledge the same to the VA/CDL if they'd accept it.

There should be no speculating. The blog says right in it that they only cover the hot funds...
Also, note that like most other things they seem to do, they aren't going cheap and offering flimsy insurance--they're using one of world's largest and most liquid insurers.
imo, this is a lot of win.

So what's the "why the delay" button say...?
