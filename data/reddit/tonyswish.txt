I remember seeing the "big announcements" meaning less and less during 2014 as I was with BitPay. Ending the year with the Microsoft announcement really capped off really everything we built to.
Credibility is here, now it's time to get to work and improve the system!
@_date: 2015-05-08 04:46:35
Thank you for the compliment.
Unfortunately I don't want to give out how we get our guests, but some are as simple as just emailing and asking.... Working with Glenn Jacobs, Shooter Jennings and Steve Albini was incredibly, incredibly easy. All three are great people who are honest and prompt, so easy to work with.
@_date: 2015-05-08 03:57:27
Most people don't care about financial topics whatsoever and that includes high profile people. Albini is a hero of mine and he reaffirmed what I believed about people's interest in bitcoin in general.
Oh and I promoted my podcast a lot at [decentralize.fm](
@_date: 2015-05-08 08:06:23
That is an awesome story. It's hard to remember being a pre-Internet music fan, I was one but it was just so different and much more expensive.
His forums are awesome but they sure don't like bitcoin, which actually surprised me as it was so overwhelming. 80% negative but that board was 99% negative. I'm not the type to push it so I wouldn't bring it up there, but I did register and am doing the lurk moar thing because that's actually great advice.
Honestly the reason Albini isn't a bitcoiner is that he doesn't care about Finance and that's really it, at least that's how it came across to me but you can listen for yourself. I never really cared about finance either, but I liked technology so I got into it.
@_date: 2015-05-11 18:58:26
Thanks for noting Augur! This list also would have been something I loved for the last podcast we did at decentralize.fm, but I will definitely refer to it in the future.
@_date: 2015-05-08 07:23:30
Nothing we can say publicly.
@_date: 2015-05-08 03:59:58
Thank you! Comments like these make me happier than one would ever imagine as they confirm that someone is enjoying what I help to create.
Our topics are very niche and it's not the easiest to find a sizable audience who shares interest in those topics, in fact finding 3 people who wanted to do a show like this with me was nearly impossible until I started working in the field.
Please keep listening and if you have time, any help spreading the word would be amazing. Either way, thank you for your comment as it definitely improved my day :-)

The truth is, I have no idea who you are and I doubt you know Ryan in real life, nor do you know his character or his talent. Ryan is the kind of person who didn't need Reddit and he can write his own ticket, he's a part of this scene because he cares and he's passionate about it.
I would never write this post to defend myself, but I saw how influential and talented he is with the development of Copay. Your trolling is obvious but it made me sad so I felt the need to reply.
@_date: 2015-01-22 09:57:44
Thank you! I thought the Twitter campaign in particular was a huge success.
@_date: 2015-01-22 04:39:46
Just for clarification, Vitalik's only role with the company is as an advisor...not quite sure how there was a miscommunication there but wanted to clarify.
@_date: 2015-01-10 08:18:22
Thanks! To be fair most of the companies I am interested in are located there, I was mostly trying to be diplomatic.
I do know that working with you was fantastic, and I've never been more sad to leave a group of people. I hope you are doing well at Reddit and we still want you on our podcast when you are ready and have time.
@_date: 2015-01-12 00:49:09
Just for the record I was not "behind the bitcoin bowl", the only thing I had to do with it was the social media campaign and press anouncements.
@_date: 2015-01-17 03:40:26
Thanks James! You are damn impressive yourself!
@_date: 2015-05-08 07:25:22
This is awesome! I am a pretty big fan too, but I do prefer Shellac as it's just more my style.
If you enjoy the interview please share it and spread the word, also feel free to share any quotes you loved that he said... my favorite on another listen was:
“I think the concept of Intellectual Property is so wrong at it’s face that something else needs to be codified into law, because using Intellectual Property as the basis for everything limits the behavior of normal people into these odd prescribed things that serve only the corporate interest and don't benefit any individual creator.”
@_date: 2015-01-22 09:29:09
Just to reiterate, I was only behind the commercials and the social media campaign....not the bowl game sponsorship itself!
@_date: 2015-01-30 19:43:29
No, you can only judge him by what you assume from the Internet and the Internet's opinion. Checkout Copay and Insight. He has done work that matters, you just choose to argue.
@_date: 2015-01-09 15:41:16
Thank you!
I have no plans now, definitely looking for any interesting opportunities. This is actually the first time in my adult life I have been unemployed so it feels a bit odd, but I have been offered opportunities recently and with some of the recent successes I have had, I feel confident.
I want to stay in decentralized technology and my podcast with some fellow BitPayers named [Decentralize]( is going to continue on.
In my time at BitPay I definitely grew tons of confidence and knowledge about this space, I don't think there is anyone under the "marketing" umbrella that can bring to the table what I can. Being the rare marketing guy that hung out with the developers and grew those relationships really helped me understand things in a different way than a lot of people in the field.
@_date: 2015-01-17 03:48:28
Thank you very much as well!
@_date: 2015-01-09 18:26:25
Message sent. Thanks for the interest!

Thank you so much, I replied to your other comment as well. The feeling is more than reciprocated!
@_date: 2015-01-17 00:55:07
Thanks Ryan, I'm excited as hell for this.
It also means I will be in San Francisco more, starting at the OReilly Conference at the end of this month. What places do I need to go to when I'm out there? It will be my first time ever.
@_date: 2015-01-09 15:55:09
Not too sure, but Bitcoin will be involved. I'm not someone who likes to stay idle so I am already on the hustle.
I was part of a lot of successful projects at BitPay so I am hoping I can continue my run of success somewhere else! The  campaign was my baby and I have some even better ideas I want to do either independently or with a future employer.
@_date: 2015-01-09 18:28:48
I'm not sure, I would like to stay here as it is the headquarters of the Payments Industry and any Bitcoin company should have at least some presence in Atlanta. I'm open though.
@_date: 2015-01-09 16:34:06
There were so many but off the top of my head:
- The Bitcoin Bowl Social Media campaign
- Both commercials that aired on ESPN
- Reaching out to my contacts in the music industry (50 Cent)
- Building the relationship with Warner Bros. and promoting the Mastodon release
- Closed a few deals (one with a company with $80 million in yearly revenue) and I'm not even in Sales
- Creating video and digital content for the Microsoft and Copay announcements

Ryan is the farthest thing from an idiot.
He is a smart advocate as well, I worked with him at BitPay and I can't say enough positive things about Ryan. Wherever he ends up will be extremely lucky to have him on their team.

There are tons of them, you just have to know where to look and see through the fakes.
Good leaders do so by example, not by hype and bullshit.
@_date: 2015-04-29 00:20:57
Thank you for the Augur mention, we agree it's exciting and I agree that a lot of the others you mention have tons of potential as well.

@_date: 2015-04-29 01:06:33
When people read more about it, they often say that which is awesome. Even people not familiar with prediction markets have said this so we want to continue spreading the word!
@_date: 2015-04-24 06:35:04
I laughed really hard at this
@_date: 2015-04-29 22:40:21
Basically a decentralized prediction market has the potential to create the most accurate forecasting measures possible. If the userbase is large enough the projection is more accurate due to the number of predictions made by those wagering.
**A good example:**
"In 2007, Columbia Business School Professor Michael Mauboussin asked his 73 students to estimate the number of jelly beans in a jar.
Their estimates ranged from 250 to 4,100. There were 1,116 candies. The average error, which only two students beat, was 700. That is a 62% rate of error.
  
However, despite the b-school students' poor judgment, the average of their guesses was 1,151— only 3% away from the actual number of jelly beans."
 
This study has been repeated in many forms, and the results remain the same. We are bringing this convergence of beliefs to every subject from politics to climatology, harnessing the wisdom of the crowd; and forcing the crowd to put their money where their mouth is.
The easiest way to explain is from a few examples on our website [Augur.net]( Check out the section "What we do" and feel free to reach out to us on Twitter [ and we can answer any further questions.
@_date: 2015-04-18 00:14:58
This article helps to make me realize how amazing it is to be working with Augur and the brilliant individuals I am in daily contact with.
I've only spent one week in the house and I have to say it was intense and I learned more in that one week than in 4 years of college. So proud to be a part of Augur!
I will say one more thing....the castle and the community in general is definitely full of characters.
@_date: 2015-04-01 23:10:49
Part of what he is saying is true, it's still too complicated and people have to get over decades of the instilled connotation of what money is.
On the plus side, the slow growth of bitcoin is helping to ensure that it can steadily scale to more use. Everyone wants to be rich and are impatient, if you care about the tech you are happy as can be by the adoption rate.
@_date: 2015-04-27 21:10:20
A video is coming very soon as well to explain the process, it's been produced as we speak.
@_date: 2015-04-09 06:06:08
Getting them to accept it wouldn't be easy as it is a publicly traded company. I have had conversations about Bitcoin with more than a few of the company's performers (Curtis Axel being the other public name, but the other names are pretty large).
George Barrios, Triple H, any of the McMahons, Kevin Dunn or maybe a select few other executives would be the ones I would need to speak with. Give me 15 minutes and I believe I could easily convince them to do it, and knowing their desire to stay cutting edge, they would be a far better target than any of the "major" sports brands.
When I was at BitPay, I was making inroads.... I hope that someone from CoinBase, BitPay, BitNet or someone else reads this and contacts me as I would love to finish that job.
@_date: 2015-04-18 01:12:04
Yes, I work remotely and I wish the article discussed more about the actual brilliant people who are in and out of the house.
@_date: 2015-03-26 02:30:14
I've worked in Bitcoin for a minute and didn't understand how much is happening to San Francisco until I was there.
Firstly, try meetup.com as they list a lot of events.
It's most important to realize that the community won't be bending over backwards to help you here and in order to really gain an audience on Twitter you will need to get a reputation of someone who is knowledgable and trustworthy about Bitcoin or related technologies.
Good luck to you and feel free to ask me questions on Twitter: [
@_date: 2015-03-26 06:06:25
This reply is hilarious, the only reason I'm acknowledging it though is to state that there is not an eye in the middle. Keep trollin dude.

The one thing they did forget (or I forgot to emphasize when I talked to the Author) is a link to my Podcast!
It's with Eric Martindale, James Walpole and Charles Ferguson and you can check it out at [decentralize.fm]( and follow us on Twitter [ We have had some pretty interesting guests like Shooter Jennings, BitPay CEO Stephen Pair, Bitcoin Core Dev &amp; BitSat/Dunvegan Space mastermind Jeff Garzik and Augur's lead developer Joey Krug. 
Please give it a shot and give us your feedback, especially on requests for guests. We try not to limit it to just Bitcoin/Blockchain related topics and will also be speaking with people who may be innovators in a field that may have changed the way information is delivered. In fact we have already talked to Bryan Alvarez, the co-host on the most popular "Internet Radio Show" on eYada.com, a 1999 startup that did podcasting over 5 years before the term was born. It's my favorite episode as I was a loyal listener at the time (and still am). I'm hoping to do more things like this with all of the hosts involved in the future.
@_date: 2015-03-26 05:53:53
When you use the term "independent bands" it could mean a variety of things. I would recommend any business accept Bitcoin as there is no risk if you use a payment processor that converts to Fiat, and it will get the band attention if you post it here and on other Bitcoin related places on the net.
For smaller artists the gain is really for promotion and maybe exposure. Both of these remain as the artist gets larger, but the savings for a larger indie artist can be large as the 0% processing fees do significant amounts of money when the volume is high.
The biggest way it could help both indie and major label artists is by utilizing micropayments for royalties. ASCAP is usually used by artists, and for smaller bands the royalties are tiny but removing the cost of doing the transaction is a huge benefit.
The last (and maybe most immediately relevant) way is to setup a tip.me account from ChangeTip and put that URL on all of your social feeds. If an artist is proactive and a part of the Bitcoin community (see Shooter Jennings and YTCracker), the community tends to be more generous to that artist.

I would love to do a presentation like this in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York or Nashville. If any music or crypto conferences are interested please contact me, and follow me on Twitter [
Something I would love to do is to get a panel with myself, Shooter Jennings and maybe one of the guys I worked with at Warner Bros. Records to discuss things like this. I am swamped with 3 projects right now so I am not able to proactively "sell" this panel, but if any larger tech/bitcoin/music conference is interested, please contact me and I'm sure I could make it happen.
@_date: 2015-03-18 08:45:23

If I was in someone from Ripple's shoes I would do the same thing.

@_date: 2015-03-26 01:45:24
Some of the details I am leaving to describe at the event itself, but I will say a bit here.
Warner actually came to us which is shocking, it was to work with a different band that didn't pan out. In general Warner Bros. were amazing to work with and shattered every expectation and previous experience with a major label. The VP of Marketing is a guy by the name of J. Scavo and I can't speak enough about how foreward thinking, intelligent and professional he was. Since working with him I found out that many in music feel the same way and he is genuinely one of the smartest people working at a label in any position.
The other person who helped was a guy by the name of Kazy Brown, he was real creative and since I worked in music we were on the same page with many of the ideas for campaigns that we had (most didn't pan out).
I may put this on YouTube but unsure, I would like to do a similar speaking engagement at a larger Bitcoin event to really explain why this sort of thing helps out Bitcoin more than most realize. Having names of cultural interest that accept it really does help to give Bitcoin credibility to a new audience. Through Bitcoin I also became amazing friends with Shooter Jennings and I can't say enough positive about him.
@_date: 2015-03-26 06:50:37
Thanks for the kind words and if the lightbulb ever goes off in your company, have them contact me and I would be happy to share with them the best route from the tech end and the press side.
Send me a direct message and I can share more with you, if you are interested.
@_date: 2015-03-26 05:34:35
A few I can tell you are:
* Ashton Kutcher
* Joe Rogan
* Daryl Palumbo (Lead singer of Glassjaw &amp; Head Automatica)
* Val Venis (former WWE wrestler)
* Jon Fitch (former UFC fighter)
* One member of Slipknot (not sure which, but I know one of them is super into it)
* Death Grips (Not only my favorite band at the moment but they leaked an album on TOR and accept Bitcoin through their merch seller, HelloMerch.com)
* Richard Sherman (Plays for the Seahawks and accepts Bitcoin on his webstore)
I'm sure there's more, but those are a few I found out about via various means. If someone else can make some additions it would be super helpful!
@_date: 2015-03-18 11:00:58
This was something I helped launch at Money 2020 and I have to say the developers did a wonderful job.
Seeing them bust their ass to both finish the app and implement NFC in such a short time after the ApplePay announcement really made me happy that it is getting this praise. Being a part of the launch itself is one of my favorite things I was involved with at the company.
The hidden gem is the "ding" sound when a transaction is made, this was another late addition by Chaz Ferguson that ended up being instantly memorable. We used the ding in our Bitcoin Bowl commercials and every part of me believes it should be the definitive sound of bitcoin, in the same way cha-ching is to dollars.

Explaining Bitcoin can be difficult, explaining what a prediction marketplace is while also explaining the utilization of Ethereum instead of Bitcoin is extremely difficult.
That difficulty is why I took the job, and he did this interview within my first two weeks at Augur.
@_date: 2015-03-18 08:37:34
Really? That's awesome! I would love to chat with you... do you have Skype or Twitter?? What's the best way to get ahold of you?
@_date: 2015-03-26 11:17:45
We just moved and have literally nothing up on the walls yet! It's the last room we have to do. Augur is also decentralized and built on Ethereum so it's much different in how it's implemented. Check out the [Augur White Paper]( and see what we are doing.
The growth of the platform will be necessary for the increased accuracy of the predictions, but having a growing platform doesn't mean that the markets being used aren't effective and usable. Our lead devs are leading a pretty open environment with the community and we are all trying to be open about everything, and we are hoping that leads to the public's trust.
@_date: 2015-03-26 04:16:50
Unfortunately none of the artists will be appearing to speak (that I am aware of currently that is). Mastodon are currently on tour so I doubt that would happen either way.

According to [this Coindesk article]( he is an investor in Coinbase.
I'm a big Nas fan myself and would love to get in contact with him to talk about Bitcoin on our podcast [decentralize.fm]( (for another cheap plug). Unfortunately a lot of these higher profile celebrities who are also investors tend to avoid doing media.

Thank you for posting that. Fortunately, the success I had in the past year with a well-known brand and contacts I made resulted in recruiters contacting me rather often. I know what I offer would be perfect for BitNet but if they have any interest, they know who I am and where I'm at.
It is a really nice position to be in as the demand for Marketing people in tech isn't always very high. I think the whole  campaign really increased my visibility and I'm so thankful for all the help I had with it. 
@_date: 2015-03-26 04:09:58
Shooter has become a great friend through this whole bitcoin scene, he has also done so much to help out Bitcoin with few knowing. I can't say enough positive things about this guy.
In addition to the interview you posted, Shooter actually was the very first guest on my own podcast that I do with some friends who are current and former BitPay employees. Check out the podcast at [decentralize.me]( and you can go directly to his episode [here](
Just a note that the episode with Shooter was our very first one and since then we have changed hosts and formats, so the new episodes sound much better and have improved quality. As for the guest interview, Shooter was fantastic and we couldn't have asked for someone better to kick off our show.

Somehow I missed seeing this when it was originally posted so I do apologize for the slow response, I did share it with the rest of the Augur team so they may chime in as well. I (Tony Sakich) have been with Augur since the beginning of the year and have been impressed with the intelligence and integrity of the team.
Yes we are having a crowdsale, if you don't want to participate then you don't have to, and if you want to make sure your advice to avoid participating is known...that is fine too.
What does bother me is how you just label it a scam without any research, backing or evidence to substantiate your claim. Clearly you are not a fan of alt-coins, but you use melodramatic language and assumptions to make it sound like our project is the root of all evil. Until our product launches and we actually exist, skepticism is more than valid and we are happy to address all questions that are skeptical in a public forum.
The reason this post bothered me so much personally is that I was with BitPay which undeniably has one of the best reputations in the crypto space, this is because of their hard and honest work. When Jeremy approached me to join Augur I was skeptical (as I should have been), but the more I learned and talked with team members, the more I realized that these were not scammers. 
Since joining, I have had the opportunity to chat about Augur with people like Robin Hanson, Elizabeth Stark, Erik Voorhees, Ari Kaplan and many more. The depth of these discussions and their reactions have been across the board, but the word "scam" was never used.
So UnitPayments, don't invest in altcoins if they bother you so much and continue to raise alarms to ones that you feel are not worth investing in to others. Please don't label us as a scam when we haven't even launched yet. Please research us more and research prediction markets more. Look into blogs like Overcoming Bias and Less Wrong, read what Nate Silver has to say about Prediction Markets. 
Also realize that anyone from the Augur team will be glad to answer questions about our product to anyone, in fact I'm posting our Twitter handles here so anyone reading this thread can ask us any questions they have. Some of us (Myself, Joey, Jack &amp; Jeremy) are more active on Twitter than others (Scott and Chris) so please [tweet me]( and I will be happy to make sure the person gets back to you if they don't see the question.

Multiple payment processors offer free or next to free processing and they pay out in fiat, it's really doing nothing but increasing who can buy your product, especially digitally as bitcoin is a global currency. There is literally no reason to not accept it if you are selling a digital product, that's the one place where bitcoin truly shines.
@_date: 2015-02-08 21:22:51
A good move is simply to befriend and inform higher profile people who already know about bitcoin. Slow and steady is the way growth should be handled.
