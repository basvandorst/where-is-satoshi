The only way to minimize the cap gains hit is to hold for over 1 year. Then it's considered long-term gains.

Using a single blockchain isn't decentralized. The cryptospace has several dimensions of decentralization which can be utilized.

My name is ………………. from Ghana, I want to know the ruling of a Muslim investing into crypto
Like bitcoin, Gcrcoins , Litecoin, etc.
Wa Salam
My Answer:Dear Br. …………..
Assalamu Alaykum wa Rahmatu Allahi wa Barakatuh.


permissible as money. Therefore until such coins are adopted by a formal government they are
not acceptable as money. Beside speculation in money is not permissible anyway.

Dear Brother in Islam
I have to doubt and want to confirm the same in the light of sharia from you.
These days we are getting advertisements of BIT COIN and how this is going to be a future of
currency. I want to know whether Investing in BITCOIN is HALAL as per Sharia Law.
Jazaka Allah Khair

Dear Br. Riaz
Assalamu Alaykum wa Rahmatu Allahi wa Barakatuh
I believe that any claimed currency cannot be recognized unless it is adopted by a formal
government. Without being a currency of a country (not a phony government) any such
currency cannot be recognized in Shari’ah. it you deal with bitcoin not as a currency it is then
merely illusion and claim.

Libertarian Socialism is entirely possible through the blockchain. In fact, it could be the only possible implementation - removing corruption through decentralization. It could be like some sort of inverse staking system, where the volume of the wallet determines the payout but larger wallets get less. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:26:34
It doesn't take out of your wallet. All wallets receive dividends in a staking system, but the staking rewards are inverted so that smaller volume wallets receive a larger % relative to their balance. This "EBTcoin" would have to use another decentralized identity tech to prevent fraud.

While Crassius was rich as fuck, Mansa Musa was so rich that during his pilgrimage to Mecca, he gave away so much gold that inflation collapsed the local economies behind him. On his return trip, he had to buy it all back with interest in order to deflate the gold supply. Show me a single Roman with that much personal wealth - no Caesar possessed the entire treasury of the Empire.

@_date: 2017-11-30 19:47:41
Deflationary assets don't work well as currencies since they store value and discourage trade. Most cryptos in the market today have some level of inflation, including bitcoin - what do you think mining is? It's inflation, just asymptotically fixed inflation.
@_date: 2017-11-04 01:45:32
That's not historically accurate though. Check the blockchain.

Yeah but how do I get it onto a debit card? BitPay provides a quality service even if they're no better than a bank. At least their mobile app gives you the private keys, unlike coinbase. This proposal is basically just LocalBitcoins but as a dApp.
@_date: 2017-09-29 20:48:08
Unfortunately, real-world payment applications require at least one, if not three, confirmations on the chain before validating a transaction. This is just a security feature of these application layers due to lack of fraud-correction services with a decentralized tech, not a failure of the bitcoin protocol. For instance, if I use BitPay to buy a game on Steam, it requires 1 confirm before validating the transaction. If I use the BitPay app to sell my coins and then use my BitPay debit card, however, it's instantaneous because it's all off-chain.

One thousanth of a coin is only worth $5.75 right now so it's pretty meaningless and such a purchase would probably cost more than it's worth in fees. Once you can afford a couple hundred dollars worth, whatever price it's at, then it'll be worth investing.

Many of the rises are created by the snowballing hype and increasing adoption injecting fresh money into the bitcoin ecosystem. However,  one of the events that brought bitcoin into mainstream attention was the arrest of Ross Ulbricht and seizure of the Silk Road. This, along with increasing attention from regulators and the media, preceded the meteoric rise in late 2013. The crashes are more easily related to news and events in said ecosystem, such as Mt. Gox insolvency.

You shouldn't be too concerned about such a low amount. Once you reach the point of having enough bitcoin that losing it would be problematic, you might want to take your own security into consideration.

Still, gold's industrial value is far below it's speculative price. Bitcoin's value comes from creating digital scarcity, which is itself rare. To say that bitcoin's value is an illusion is as true as saying the value provided by Facebook or Reddit are illusions. It's a way to create non-duplicable data which is extremely valuable in the information age. Facebook, Reddit, etc only have value as long as they have users. Same with Bitcoin. Get with the new paradigm or perish.
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:57:04
First, you keep checking. Then, you realize that shorting your position can let you make *more* bitcoin. Then you start trading, which has to be the most thrilling thing one can do from a phone.
