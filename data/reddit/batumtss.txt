It’s not as easy as you think, whales don’t automatically make profit. Savvy manipulation is required, and its usually timed with the news. If there’s no liquidity that person is not going to profit, because the average price will be lower than his average buy in price. It doesn’t always work out.
@_date: 2019-07-27 16:00:26
This is an example of retail buying near the top. You should never use money you’re willing to lose. You’re gambling half your 5 years savings, if it’s money you’re worried about. I’m still not sure why you didn’t buy at around 3k -4K and decided to buy after a 200%+ increase.
@_date: 2019-07-27 16:02:39
I still don’t fucking understand why people are using most of their savings to buy bitcoin after a 200+% increase this year. Where are these people getting investment advice from? My guess would be this sub.
@_date: 2019-07-27 16:19:58
But your original post you said 9-10k. Alright man nvm you do you.
@_date: 2019-07-18 16:56:49
Maybe, or maybe it's some whale/whales using the current events to pump it, then to dump it after the fomo to make easy bucks. Hence, why I think it's going to chop up and down.
@_date: 2019-07-27 15:55:58
Tell me exactly how government regulation will change this? You think one government will have jurisdiction over the world to control this? Not happening.
@_date: 2019-07-19 21:21:58
They’re not a US based exchange how the fuck will the US government shut down bitmex.
@_date: 2019-07-18 16:34:14
This honestly looks like complete price manipulation to get newbies to fomo. I have a feeling it'll chop up and down to fuck with all the new guys entering the market. 15% in a few hours is absolutely not organic growth. Be careful out there.
@_date: 2019-07-10 17:45:54
Market got too greedy, not an organic growth so lots of people taking profits - therefore a correction.

@_date: 2019-08-31 18:52:21
I really think we're both arguing about different things here, I'm arguing about privacy features, i agree generally with what you said about bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-05 20:34:10
It goes both ways now that it’s pumped like crazy in a week, everyone’s coming out with good predictions, and telling each other to buy. Usually these are good indicators that the opposite may happen soon. It’s also a good example of good traders/investors buying when there’s blood on the streets and selling when the eurphoria is getting overblown in mainstream media/ social media. When you feel euphoric after a huge increase in a short span of time. It’s a good indication that your should be cautious too.
@_date: 2019-08-05 20:38:11
Lol until it drops down by 3-4K like it did last week. BTC is always a risky investment. Not sure why you consider this crazy fluctuation as “stable”
@_date: 2019-08-24 22:56:33
Can confirm I lost a lot of BTC trying to trade, I spent a lot of time learning trading, and it's still hard. My best method was simply to DCA at major dips and forget about it.
@_date: 2019-08-07 15:06:48
lol these whales truly fucking with all the fomo newbies.
@_date: 2019-08-28 21:25:39
It's also very risky to catch a falling knife, this could dip more after it broke 10k. Panic tends to take some time to set in, especially with Asia still asleep. I'd wait till the price stabilizes. Don't forget how BTC kept crashing from 5k to 3k, after it dipped from 6k to 5k.
@_date: 2019-08-29 00:27:23
Why would it need privacy when there are other cryptos out there that has that feature already. If bitcoin implements this feature, and that would require a consensus because it's not owned by one person, do you think governments will take kindly to money that can be hidden and untraceable? It would give governments more incentive to ban people from owning it.
@_date: 2019-08-29 00:45:14
Are you sure about that? Because if every government bans bitcoin, like China. It would go underground and become associated with the black market, that is not a recipe for mass adoption, that's the complete opposite. Bitcoin would be heading backwards.
@_date: 2019-08-30 22:49:47
I don't think you get it, sure you obviously can't ban bitcoin, but governments absolutely can fuck with the off and on ramps of accessing ability to buy bitcoins. You assume the majority of people out there are technically savvy if you think mass adoption of bitcoin can occur when government decide to shutdown exchanges, and are stop them from selling bitcoin.
Like i said they can push it underground but that is exactly not how global "currency" will not be adopted. It's been underground and used to buy stuff by the technically saavy small minority for years, that won't change if governments do their best to stop people from using and buying bitcoin. What I'm saying is by adding privacy features this might give governments more incentive to slow down or try and stop the adoption of bitcoin.
Storing, buying and selling bitcoin is already hard enough for a lot of people to understand. Only a tiny population of the U.S own bitcoins for this reason.
It's naive to think government actions will have no effect on the adoption of bitcoin. They want to be able to track people's money. You can do that to an extent with bitcoin. You can't do that with monero. Which is why I think monero will have a special use case especially for black markets and won't be used as a global currency everyone uses in their everyday lives.
I also meant the post of the guy who said we need privacy in bitcoin, not the original topic of this entire thread.
@_date: 2019-08-29 00:24:21
Please explain how the SEC is going to close BITMEX, do you even know where BITMEX is located?
@_date: 2019-08-05 20:47:25
Lol I think you’ll be ok then even if bitcoin did go to 0. Everything I post I also assume others will read it, so it wasn’t meant to be only directed at you. I’m just seeing so many people in this subreddit telling each other to keep buying, and making all these claims about how bitcoin is going to continue to rocket because of China. Yeah that’s usually a red flag to me, and a good time to be cautious. I mean someone’s gotta tell the new guys to be cautious or they’ll make absurd financial decisions based on what this sub tells them.
@_date: 2019-08-29 15:56:39
Did you even read the thread from the beginning? Not exactly sure what your point is in regards to privacy.
I agree it's in the acceptance phase, but implementing privacy features is NOT what bitcoin should be going for, because that would quickly change whether or not it will continue to stay in this acceptance phase. 
If you want privacy, use monero. There's already a crypto out there for that. Privacy is a special use case, I don't think crypto like monero will become mainstream, it will have a strong use case because black market will always be around. But we don't want to force bitcoin underground.
@_date: 2019-08-05 19:06:24
It had already been at 9k smart guy. 25%+ in a week and you choose to buy now. I’m just wondering why people keep buying after pumping like that. It’s happened so many times on this forum, I’ve seen people say they’ve put in half their savings at 13k and complain about it after. Just be wary about how overhyped bitcoin gets, and don’t buy into it, especially when you’re in these types of threads. 
otherwise you’ll find yourself buying near the top. And for your sake I hope it isn’t your savings and this money you can afford to lose. When something moves up like that fast there’s usually a hard correction.
If you’re doing this long term and planning on averaging down or up then w/e just hope it keeps going up. But there doesn’t seem to be any good reason why the price has pumped this fast in a short time. It’s all based on hype.
@_date: 2019-08-06 17:49:08
I understand what you're saying, but you're assuming everyone got in early. The reason why it's pumping is because new people are getting in without understanding the risks. Gold is generally not a good investment either, all the great investors like Buffet say the same thing - they're both highly speculative commodities. Which should be considered high risk. It went from 20k to 3k back to 10k, that's extremely volatile and therefore risky for your average person. When you hear people throwing in their life savings when BTC was at 15k, I'm willing to bet most of those people sold at a loss out of panic. That's the very definition of risky. And it should not be any more than 5-10% of your portfolio because BTC's value is based on speculation. It's not being used as currency because of the slow transactions and volatility. If it's being compared to gold, it's still way more volatile than gold. This may be a dream for great traders, but for your average investors it's definitely risky. Especially considering that lots of government regulations worldwide have yet to decide how to control crypto.
@_date: 2019-08-29 16:17:34
I think the issue with btc as a safe haven is volatility. It's not safe if it can go from 14000$ to 9.5k in a month or so. People find gold safer because it's marketcap is so damn high these kinds of volatility aren't an issue. The comparatively low marketcap for crypto makes it easy to manipulate by the big players unlike gold.
@_date: 2019-08-05 20:22:43
Ok man good for you then. I wasn’t trying to imply whale pumping. But w/e is happening in China doesn’t seem like a good reason to invest in bitcoin after a 25% pump. That’s just me. It’s pumping because the media and people spreading the media are hyping up the idea that it’s going up because of China. I’m assuming now that you aren’t new here. 
I’m just throwing out word of caution to the new guys who keep lamenting buying the top on this subreddit. It’s generally not a good idea to buy after it has pumped more than 25% in just a week. There just seems to be a lot of new guys fomoing based on this news hype, or w/e hype people like to circulate around the web to keep pumping the price.
It’s the new retail guys who get the short end of the stick. It’s a dangerous speculative game to try play the price of bitcoin based on what’s going on in China. And I’m also assuming a lot of newbies are buying now because all these so called “pundits” are screaming bitcoin will rise because of this news. 
And most of them usually seem to be using money they can’t afford to lose. If they care about that money and doing it long term, then w/e I don’t think it’s a big deal. But I bet you anything most of these people on here just can’t be patient enough to invest long term, and they’ll end up trying to trade in the short to medium term. And get burned in doing so.
@_date: 2019-08-29 19:51:11
That's not at all what I was trying to say. Gold is obviously manipulated too.
@_date: 2019-08-30 01:32:17
Now it's a strong resistance
@_date: 2019-08-29 16:02:16
That's my point though, we don't want to force bitcoin underground... we don't want it to have illegal status. That will defeat the purpose of it becoming a global "currency." I don't know why some people want privacy features on bitcoin when there are other cryptos already there that are faster too. It's also funny you're comparing bitcoin to drugs, one's an addictive substance, and the other is as of right now a useless currency.
People working on bitcoin simply needs to focus on developing transaction speed, fees and accessibility, because currently those are big problems for bitcoin. Privacy features is not what we need for bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-29 00:07:16
A falling knife tends to last for some time, not just one hour. I'd at least wait a day or a few and see where the price settles. If it pumps right after the one hour drop it's very likely just a dead cat bounce and will fall back down fairly quickly as well.
@_date: 2019-10-04 16:53:18
People just like to loosely throw around the word 'scam" on this subrreddit
@_date: 2019-08-05 18:09:41
Wait are people on here still buying after a big pump? Why do people keep doing this on here, as oppose to buying at 9k...
@_date: 2019-08-28 21:15:15
It probably will, big dips like this usually take days to recover not hours, it may dip for a few days before it makes a recovery i think.

The guy is a psychopath, i don't think he cares, he's holed up in his bunker with his army of security guards. He's the finance version of the Joker, wants it his way or have everything get burned down. Only difference, he's going to fail miserably doing so.

Dude wtf has bitcoin have anything to do with dogs, that’s what it’s about, don’t be an idiot.
@_date: 2019-09-06 18:16:14
the fucking chart looks like last year when it kept getting rejected at lower highs, then blasts thru 6k finally. Except this time it's with 10k, really hope that's not the case. Buyers are losing steam.
@_date: 2019-09-06 20:58:02
Come to think of it, yeah I realized I can get some more for cheaper before the halving. Sounds like a good thing actually lol.
@_date: 2018-12-07 00:42:44
BTC SV is pumping hard, me thinks Craig Wright and co are selling BCH and BTC for his SV. It's exactly like what happened last year, people are buying into the flippening narrative, whoever is buying SV right now at least put a stop loss, because buying that pump is going to wreck you hard like it did with BCH last year.
