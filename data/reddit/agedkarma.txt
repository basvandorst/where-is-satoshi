Yes I agree with the comic. But just remember Myspace was the first one to be cool. Then facebook came along as a follow up. Just because you are king of the forest today doesn't mean the next youngster coming up can't dethrone you.

So I think you mean the volume is up. People are buying and selling. The interesting thing is the activity.

The race is one. To anyone 100% secure that bitcoin can never be dethroned I would like to remind you to check out my Myspace page. 
Edit: to clarify, I only have bitcoin and hope it is the winner, but it is hubris to think that it has to be the winner.

How does that work with Germany being a part of the Euro? Doesn't it cause problems if one Euro country declares it has two currencies?

Best example of this: The black and white TV adoption. It followed exactly the logitistic curve, then died down to near zero, reason? A new logistic curve belonging to color TV had taken off.

Bitcoin should stablize as we get more people using and more people buying and selling at any given time. Before the volume was so low that of course you will see really big swings.

Show him the price history of bitcoin. His eyes will naturally follow it upward. He'll be begging you to let him earn your bit coin off you.

I live in the USA and I don't think very often about converting my dollars into Euros. Why? Because everything around me I want to buy is priced and accepting dollars. I think we are seeing that start to happen with bitcoins. Once bitcoins are a more standard pricing measure at more outlets people will not think of bitcoins as majic investment, but as just money.
@_date: 2013-12-04 03:17:02
This is sort of interesting. Imagine if "liking" something paid .000000001 bitcoin. Or if those annoying "click and forward on to cure cancer" things cost the sender .000001 bitcoin. With a tiny toll like that maybe those silly things would cease to be.

One thing to keep in mind though is that a logistic growth function works really well when you know what long term saturation looks like. For phones we know there will at most be something like 6.5 billion users are most. We are limited by a count of people. Coinage doesn't have such a natural 1:1 relationship to count of people.

I was thinking more in a general sense of how 2 currencies would cause problems in that one could inflate and change separate from the other. All the reasons that when the Euro was adopted they at the same time discontinued the deuchmark.

This makes sense - I like how the winning number is very public and a single individual can't change it (if they could, they should be out buying/selling google!). Also it is nice that this is proportional odds and the total amount brought in is flexible. You don't have to worry about having 1000 tickets and each ticket costing 1 mBC. You can take in as much or as little as the whole group play and each person is buying a proportion of winning.

I think Bill Gates proposed something similar back years ago related to spam. If all email cost .00000000001 cents to send, then no one would really care except the people sending out 1000000000 emails, which naturally would kill off the market for mass email without really hurting the little guy. The problem was that micro payments like that in dollars is tough (but not in BC) and that email wasn't just run by a central company (but facebook is) to enforce the cost.

Gold is heavy and tough to amass in the physical bullion (In USA), bitcoin is lite and there is no such thing as "collector" bitcoin, it is all bullion.

You do sort of have a vested interest in promoting bitcoin. The more people that use it and have it and buy and sell with it, the more your bitcoins are more solidly likely to last the long haul of adoption. Don't feel bad about it. You are doing your self a small favor and introducing them to the future.
That being said, please feel free to send me bitcointip to help promote the stability this subreddit's coin. My nephews are all getting paper wallets for Christmas and a few more mBT wouldn't hurt. They are young, but they are tomorrow's bitcoin users.

I'm no techno-genious, I joined the air force right out of high school and am currently stationed in the Med. But I do keep tabs on this because my wife is hot on the idea of bitcoins. My read on this from stories earlier today was that this huge theft was almost certain to be caught soon because of the ability to track transaction and 96 millions is hard to miss. But why doesn't this guy just cash out in some exchange and hit the road with money in some swiss bank with a nice chunk in change. Is there some technical reason he is still hanging out in bitcoin world being chased?
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:42:25
I serve in the air force, deployed in the Mediterranean mostly. My wife has asked about this and so have many of my fellow service men. It would certainly make more sense than the bank transfers and western union and paypals of the world making their commission on our work overseas. But then I see an post like this and it really gives me some pause.

Here is the full text. It displays strangely for me (firefox).
Fiction: How Walmart wanted to become bitcoin early adopter
Those who belong to grammar police please do not continue as you would be offended. I am not a native speaker.
Year of Bitcoin
I start to feel that bitcoin would replace “selfie” as the word of the year 2014. Or Satoshi?
Still I didn’t saw that any major retailer accepts bitcoin as a medium of exchange during my travels around Europe. But I tend to look up to the sky,so who knows. I know, Amazon. But Amazon is not a grocery store.
I see people starting to believe that exponential growth in media coverage of bitcoins means the same as actual business adoption. I only wait for news that astronauts in space received their bitcoins securely into their space wallet. Maybe good tip for Richard Branson.
Previously I have covered several aspect of bitcoin ranging from benefits, to concerns over concentration and discussed cash infrastructure behind bitcoin market. Or looking at the activity of biggest accounts.
If I only knew
If I would ever mined and held bitcoins, I would possibly have cashed out too early.
Around $100 or so. I admit that and it took me a while to grasp why I had concerns over bright future for bitcoin.
Now imagine myself having been that clever one and that I own my mined bitcoins until today.
Price around $1100. Knowing that no major retailer is on board, no hedge funds, no banks, no private funds that would openly confirm that. I would expect this only to be beginning.
I expect to have one bitcoin for 1 million if I am patient.
That being said. The bigger the demand from retailers and other speculators, the higher the price I can expect.
Bitcoin for retail?
So now I will play the scenario of getting Walmart into bitcoin game.
They want to get in early as the price can only go up.
You want to be first in the game as more market share you own, the better control of bitcoin price fluctuation.
The bigger share of bitcoins you own, the bigger the power over other bitcoin adopters or companies profit margins that are involved in bitcoin market on smaller scale.
And you never know if Apple, Google or China got into the game. Because we play the game of anonimity. I can imagine few paranoid CEOs to freak over profit margins threatened by other bitcoin holders.Or what if they started their own virtual currency?
You never know when someone big needs to exit fast. Even for the fun of it. The risk is there.
The thing I believe most people miss is that bitcoin is NOT a legal tender.
So in case of Walmart if you do not want to present your shareholders and Wall Street with bitcoin statement, you would need to get cash out of bitcoins. Your capital structure would need to incorporate bitcoins.
Every time Walmart needs to exit into cash they would need a certain level of pre funded cash accounts on their preferred bitcoin exchange that can take their bitcoins or may face steep price drop. They do not have time to get into cash slowly, they are not miners, they do business.
The more is Walmart successful in getting people buy with bitcoins the bigger will be his request upon bitcoin exchanges to have enough newcomers with fresh cash, or speculators jumping in and out, who do not commit prominently to new cash inflows.
Yes, that can be balanced by the same customers ..people wanting to convert more and more cash into bitcoin to go to Walmart to buy stuff.
Retail supply chains
But still Walmart needs to pay various supply chains most of which are not that high on crypto-currency. They want to be paid in cash because they do not understand the legal framework of bitcoin market and do know about possible market concentration behind anonymity, and don’t want to threaten their profit margins until they are able to get into cash.
Because you know, they need to pay taxes in cash and they need to express their financial statements and capital cushions in legal tender means.
And so Walmart needs also get into cash. Why? Because they need to pay taxes and present shareholders and legal entities with revenue streams backed by legal tender.
Or do we think nations dependent on taxes more and more in this economic environment would believe companies reporting certain anonymous wallets so they then convert it through MtGox exchange rate to fiat to claim taxes? Yes we trust you, it is only these 45 wallets.
Every bigger company would try to corner the market to get control over price fluctuations, securing that way their profit margins.
Why would not Google, Apple sit down and throw into bitcoin all the cash if it was making sense?
And how would you know they didn’t do it already when there is that valued anonymity? You dillute your wallets so you never know how much market concentration there is.
Someone can hold 51% and you wouldn’t know. Would you risk that someone is trying to corner the market and get biggest share? How would you explain it to company shareholders?
Imaginary conversation:
Hey: Hey guys, Walmart went out of the game sooner. They wanted to have cash secured for tax purposes. You know they still don’t take bitcoins as legal tender.
How: But Google took all cash demand on our bitcoin exchange. Either we need to wait and sell for small amounts, or we can damage the price.
Hey: Try to call other exchange.
How: They are in the same situation, Apple wanted to pay taxes.
Hey: Ok, but I need to pay my taxes on time. So call government and your suppliers that we will pay in bitcoin.
How:Ok I will get back to you when I hear from them.
And what about grocery stores?
Correct me if I am wrong, but no country in the world accepted bitcoin as official legal tender. Please do not expect it to become widely used medium of exchange anytime soon.
Adjust accordingly.
The bitcoin exponential price is in my opinion the biggest threat to market that got ahead of its own capital infrastructure.

I would love to see a China bit coin crash - gives me a great chance to pick up bit coin from panic sellers.

So your level of bitcoin stays constant. So you really aren't increasing you savings, you are keeping the accounting constant.
