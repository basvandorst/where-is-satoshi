Ryan X. Charles here. The author reached out to me to comment before publication, but I was occupied and didn't have time. I have one important clarification that keeps coming up:
Our focus is on getting content creators paid, not on decentralized content storage. Although I am to blame for originally describing this project as a "decentralized reddit", we have decided to narrow our focus significantly to launch faster and are not decentralizing content storage.
We are, however, using decentralized p2p payments based on bitcoin. We're using a shallow Lightning Network-like system with one node. Users control their private keys.
@_date: 2016-08-01 18:50:09
No. Content storage is not decentralized.

tldr: to scale bitcoin to global adoption, even if it is only used as a settlement network and not for most transactions, we need ~10,000 times larger blocks.

That would require that I write a book. There will be a long articlish announcement in the technology soon that should go a long way towards answering your questions.
Assuming someone else wants to buy your reddit notes, you will be able to sell them for real money.

It is possible to run a full node in a web browser using Web RTC for p2p connections and IndexDB to store the blockchain. At least some nodes would need to understand both the normal tcp p2p protocol and the Web RTC flavored version for both p2p networks to overlap. In my opinion, ultimately bitcoin core should be updated to support Web RTC connections.

Suppose you have a 3-of-5 wallet, and one person dies, and their keys are lost. There are still 4 people around, and only 3 of them are necessary to send bitcoins out of the wallet. So they can still spend the bitcoins.
If, however, 3 people die and their keys are lost, then you only have 2 people left, which is not sufficient for the 3-of-5 wallet. So the bitcoins will be permanently inaccessible in in that case.

@_date: 2014-11-15 15:44:33
Although I'm delighted Alexis has re-joined reddit, it is incorrect that Yishan was anti-bitcoin. Yishan was so pro-bitcoin that he had the foresight to hire a cryptocurrency engineer, myself, and it was his idea to use cryptocurrency technology to create reddit's decentralized digital asset. Yishan deserves a huge amount of credit for being so pro-bitcoin.
Almost everyone goes through a stage of learning with bitcoin that starts with some level of misinformation. When I first heard about bitcoin in early 2011, I assumed it was a startup company trying to compete with PayPal, which I wasn't interested in, so I ignored it for several months. When I finally bothered to research it in detail, I realized how much better bitcoin was than I had thought and how terribly wrong I had been.
From the looks of the timing of this post, Yishan was about 90% of the way through that process in March. By September, when I joined and when he announced the cryptocurrency give back project, he must have been nearly 100% of the way through that process.
The give back project is not up in the air. We are moving forward at full speed. We are not at this very moment prepared to make any announcements about it, since we want to make sure we first nail the technical, legal, and community components. However, I've been very public about what I believe is the right technology for this project (for instance,  ), and my view is unlikely to change.

Bitcore developer here. Try running this command on that address:




The isValid command will reliably tell you if the address is valid. It's unintuitive if you can create an invalid address though. We should consider throwing an error in that case.
@_date: 2014-12-21 01:15:35
A financial system needs a common medium of exchange, and bitcoin fills that need. Other digital assets, like reddit notes, are not a medium of exchange. Although I realize we have been vague on the details, it is not intended to act like a currency, although it will have value.
If reddit notes do end up launching on a sidechain, it will be easy to exchange them for sidechain BTC, e.g. "SBTC", which can then be traded with real BTC either via the two-way peg or via atomic swaps. If things work out as I expect, this will work smoothly.
The "goal" of all this is just to give something back to the reddit community using the best available technology. Also note that there are other network effects than the ones you have mentioned here (I can't remember if you mentioned them in your blog post or not), including "software network effects" and "economy network effects":
* "software network effects" - by building stuff very close to bitcoin, we maximize our leverage of existing open-source software tools which only require minor additions to work with reddit notes
* "economy network effects" - by building stuff very close to bitcoin, we maximize our leverage of existing companies and ecosystem that require only minor changes to work with reddit notes

We are going to create a decentralized digital asset. My tentative plan is to launch either using one of the colored coins protocols or a sidechain, depending on how rapidly a compelling sidechain can be created. Either way I would like the sidechain and colored coin assets to be interchangeable. There is at least one way to do this, using cross-chain atomic transactions, described here:
It may also be possible to use something like the sidechain two-way peg, except that is easier said than done, because bitcoin does not validate the color transactions, so the proofs are big, meaning the transactions moving colored coins to the sidechain would be very big.
But in any case, we are indeed moving forward with creating a "cryptocurrency", though I prefer the term digital asset.
@_date: 2014-12-19 20:04:58
If you follow me on reddit or twitter, I think you would see that I am extremely transparent. The place where we are deliberately opaque is legal, because we are only interested in operating within the law and want to be sure we get that right before being public about it.

It doesn't have to do with "need", but rather, what is the most secure technology with the best community and best network effects? Colored coins allow us to satisfy our product requirements while maximally leveraging the bitcoin economy. Sidechains are the same, except with the benefit that they will have more flexibility in the future, and with the cost that they may not be ready in time for our launch.


Everything was on the table, including Counterparty and Ethereum, when I did my initial research. Many options were taken off the table as it was realized they were deficient compared to better options.
@_date: 2014-12-19 19:21:51
The post is deliberately vague about the actual technology. Everything I said before is correct. Not an altcoin. Will be colored coins or sidechains.
@_date: 2014-04-18 21:17:30
No, creating and broadcasting transactions can be done with just bitcore. Running a node that validates blocks, however, requires bitcoind.

Colored coins or sidechains.
@_date: 2014-12-19 20:08:59
Counterparty is awesome and is the right tool for a lot of projects, but there are a few reasons that make it less than ideal for reddit. I have outlined some of that in previous comments and will have more to say when we make our technology announcement.
@_date: 2014-12-19 20:41:28
Yes, correct!
@_date: 2014-12-31 18:12:06
This is not true. Both BIP39 (what Trezor uses) and BIP38 allow for password-protected seeds. They are equally secure.
@_date: 2014-12-11 19:02:52

Hmm, I haven't used bitcointalk in years. Do you think that would be more appropriate than our subreddit, ?
@_date: 2014-12-19 19:19:56
Correct. We are not making an altcoin. It is a decentralized digital asset that will almost certainly be based on either colored coins or sidechains.
@_date: 2014-12-19 22:48:03
Good point. Namecoins are an "altcoin" but they are not in competition with bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-09 19:53:05
Some Googling reveals you're probably right about that, I never actually investigated the source to know for sure. Do you happen to know where I can see this check in the source?
@_date: 2014-11-15 20:46:28
I'm in that group. I learned early in my bitcoin life that prophesizing the glorious cryptoanarchist future didn't convince anyone of anything and only put me on the receiving end of anti-bitcoin hate. Now instead of prophesizing, I just build the cryptofinancial system. Other people can figure it out for themselves.

Yeah, agreed. We haven't really solved that problem, but making decentralized things user-friendly is part of our goal.
@_date: 2014-03-11 02:06:00
At BitPay, one of our primary motivations with bitcore (a javascript bitcoin library) is to get better multisig user-friendliness. We have a tool called cosign that does this right now, but it is not user-friendly. We're committed to improving this. We greatly appreciate new developers joining our efforts.

I'm the engineer behind the project. The latest is that we've made an enormous amount of progress figuring out the technical, legal, and community components. I'm aiming to have an announcement about the technology in December. Spoiler: it will probably be colored coins and/or sidechains.
I love the prospects for sidechains in the long-term, but I'm not yet convinced they will be ready in time for this project. Colored coins satisfy all of our needs for now and are secure, and their ownly downside is that they don't have as many features as sidechains will have. Also we may run up to the blocksize limit soon. As an engineer, I'm hedging my bets and writing software compatible with both. I'll probably delay the decision about actual underlying protocol to use for a while yet until I'm sure I've made the best choice.

No, "altcoins" are currencies in competition with bitcoin either as a distinct currency unit or as an entirely separately mined currency. This is nothing like that.
@_date: 2014-12-19 19:20:54
"premined"? It is not mined at all. All of the reddit notes will be given to the community.
Edit: Also, it is not an altcoin (will be colored coins or sidechains).
@_date: 2014-07-09 16:24:10
Ryan de BitPay here. ScriptSigs with a size over 520 bytes are not relayed. Manuel calculated the relay-able M-of-N sizes here: 
Effectively this means you need to stick to small M-of-N sizes if you want your transactions to get in a block. I think this is now changed in bitcoin core master, but it will take a while before most nodes upgrade.
@_date: 2014-12-20 03:32:18
Yep! I'm well aware of that. And yes, I have access to the repo. Your protocol is on my list of options for colored coins. However over the past couple of months, I have halted my research on determining which protocol was best since we didn't need to make that decision quite yet, and there was a lot of other stuff to do. I hope to take another look at yours and the other colored coins protocols again soon.
@_date: 2014-12-19 19:32:08
Sure. At the moment I'm primarily focused on the reddit notes project (of course), but all the software I'm building is deliberately flexible so that we will have other ways to integrate things like bitcoin and dogecoin into reddit better. If you follow me on github, literally all the actual source code I'm writing is immediately open-sourced and available for anyone to follow or participate in: 
@_date: 2014-12-19 22:39:17
Lemme put it another way ... if we use "currency", it will be bitcoin, not reddit notes. reddit notes serve a different purpose than currency.
@_date: 2014-03-26 22:54:30
Coinpunk is an awesome project that we totally support. We had intended to start contributing to Coinpunk, but we realized there was a need for a new type of wallet for multisig, and it made more sense to start from scratch on that rather than try to build it in to an existing wallet.

Hey, I really appreciate your kind words. Thanks a lot!
@_date: 2014-12-21 00:42:49
I've actually already read your article on network effects, and IIRC I agreed with all of it. Of course, in normal conversation, it would be burdensome to have that level of rigor.
Both colored coins and sidechains share bitcoin's currency network effects, which is a very important component. See Oleg's article, "The universe wants one money": 
Ideally, we would have all network effects. If there was already a standard, secure technology for issuing a digital asset, that is what we would use. "Secure" is a bit hard to define, but it includes decentralization. See Nick Szabo's article "Trusted third parties are security holes": 
Since such a standard does not yet exist, we will help to define that standard, and both colored coins and sidechains are candidates for that.
Counterparty is inferior to colored coins for our purposes because the protocol is more complicated, changes frequently, adds the unnecessary XCP component, and I'm not convinced it's even secure at a fundamental level, largely because it is much harder to audit than colored coins. I think the right way to solve the problems Counterparty is trying to solve is through the use of sidechains. In any case, we don't actually need that advanced functionality for our product. However, it would be nice to be compatible with it.
Also keep in mind there will be an actual technical announcement in the future where I will explain my reasoning in detail.

Hey friends, reddit cryptocurrency engineer here. The post is deliberately vague about technology and legal. For one, we're holding back on committing to a particular technology just because the bitcoin world changes very fast, and we want to make sure we pick the right choice. However, almost certainly it will be either colored coins or sidechains.
Legally, we originally announced we're issuing a "cryptocurrency" that will be "backed" by reddit shares. Issuing such a thing would be illegal since we are not a public company. We have mostly figured out a legal strategy that allows us to give something of actual value to the community, but we are not ready at this moment to announce it.
This post was simply to update the community on our progress (i.e., it is called reddit notes), and to show you the subreddit you can follow to stay up-to-date if you wish: @_date: 2014-04-18 21:02:00

Yep, I remember witcoin and actually use it way back in the day. It was never super popular, but the core idea was there.
I had an idea for a different way to do this that would help with spam. Rather than actually spend money on upvoting, it could be based on simply proving that you have a certain amount of bitcoins buried in a certain number of blocks. That way you don't have to pay to upvote, but at the same time, it is not "free" exactly. Only people who actually have, say, at least 0.1 bitcoin buried under a bunch of blocks would be able to upvote. You couldn't create 1000 spam accounts for upvoting without locking up 100 bitcoins.

This is NOT a patent of multisig. It is a patent of the specific details of the BitGo wallet. If we didn't have patents, we could easily become victims of bigger companies that do. We will have more information soon on how we intend to use this for defensive purposes only.
See Ben D's response: 
@_date: 2014-12-19 22:42:24
Yes. Nutshell: Users hold the private keys, and multisig will be involved, probably via an authenticator app on your phone. The authenticator may be optional to enhance usability for people who care less about security.

And that is absolutely necessary before most of the bitcoin 2.0 ideas make any sense anyway.

All this makes perfect sense post facto, but what's not obvious from the outside is how turbulent things were on the inside. In the span of a mere 4 months, the following things happened: they announced raising $50 million, the CEO quit, many other people quit, many were hired, the entire remote company moved to SF, to a new office the location of which changed dramatically from Daly City to SOMA, and many people were reassigned to new positions constituting a new org structure, and I was hired and fired. It is obvious to me in hindsight how I could have played politics in this environment, but it was not at all obvious as it was occurring. Also I made the strategic albeit perhaps incorrect decision to actually try to get things done in this environment rather than play the game.

It certainly may be. However, note that modern browsers have something called IndexedDB which can store huge amounts of data, and would be a way to cache derived addresses.

I earned my income in 100% bitcoin for a year. This was mostly during the period when bitcoin was falling in price. I got by just fine by selling most of the bitcoin as soon as I earned it. I spent a lot where I could, particularly by using Gyft to buy gift cards.
It was educational to live on bitcoin. I would do it again. Except, I would pick a time when the price was going up more than down.

I will be happy to share the nitty gritty details at some point in the future, but right now they are internal secrets and reddit as a company will figure out what type of announcements to make about that project. Once reddit announces things and the stuff I know is no longer secret, I will happily talk about it.

I theorize that bitcoin developers are too interested in cryptography and AI to notice glaring market opportunities in payments.
Edit: Also, the link you gave actually does not contain the above idea, but rather micropayment channels, which do not actually need to play a role in the example I gave. Normal bitcoin transactions would probably suffice for v1.

Hey everyone, it is correct that I spent a large fraction of my time at reddit implementing bitcoin in javascript. The purpose of this was severalfold. First of all, I wanted to build the infrastructure for reddit's cryptofinancial system. This sounds a little bit ridiculous in hindsight because the new leadership is so uninterested in bitcoin that I think something like that is not going to happen for a long time.
The major application of that I was developing was the reddit wallet. You can see in fullnode that I had gotten as far as transaction building and validation in javascript, *including a script interpreter*, which is not exactly trivial if your goal is to make it completely compatible with bitcoin core. My code passes all the relevant script tests from bitcoin core so it at least comes close (although I do not recommend anybody rely on this code to run an actual full node - please don't yell at me, Peter Todd).
The reddit wallet, should it have existed, had absolutely enormous potential. The goal was to make it really easy for redditors to have and transact in digital assets, particularly bitcoin, dogecoin, and reddit notes, as well as any other assets using whatever protocol we ultimately used for reddit notes (probably colored coins or sidechains).
Consider the implications of making p2p payments possible on the world's largest pseudonymous communication platform. It had the potential to play a large role in the global economy. It is a tragedy that this opportunity will now be missed (or at least substantially delayed).
Besides simply enabling reddit's wallet, I also had a very deliberate strategy in developing what I did when I did and how I did. It needed to be open-source, both because I think that this was the best strategy for reddit and for bitcoin, and also because it was the best strategy for me personally. I figured the worst thing that could happen at reddit was that we could launch something and it would fail. What actually happened was that we launched nothing and I got fired. In only 4 months. This was worse than the worst outcome I thought was possible. Fortunately, I wrote a lot of highly relevant open-source software during my brief tenure so that any prospective employers, clients, or co-founders can see that at least I wasn't stagnating during this time.
Also, it was very educational to implement everything myself.


Unfortunately, I am not friends with Yishan and have not been in touch with him since he left. However, I think he's a great guy and probably will try to contact him soon as it would be really interesting to catch up and talk about everything that has happened.


reddit is an awesome company, but sadly this is an accurate assessment. While Yishan was CEO, I reported directly to him, as the lead engineer of the sadly never-to-be cryptocurrency engineering wing of reddit. When Yishan left, I reported to no one. I had no formal meetings with anyone, and the only communication I had with other people at the company was informal. Being fired became a very real possibility, but I hung on as long as possible hoping I could maybe endure despite the challenges, because the upside was so incredible. That didn't last.

@_date: 2015-01-31 15:12:28
I wouldn't do anything different. Before Yishan left, I was working on his pet project, directly in communication with the CEO. After he left, I had no communication with the new executives. That was out of my control. (Although like I said, I could have tried harder to communicate with them, but that would have meant playing politics all day, which I decided was not the best use of my time. Perhaps that would have made the difference. I dunno.)
Edit. Although since you asked about a fresh start, that is the situation I am in now. I'm considering all of my options, but I remain comitted to making bitcoin happen.
@_date: 2015-01-10 20:13:56


I'm no longer at BitPay, but I doubt that's in the plan. The way we solved this problem with Copay was for the client to do the BIP32 discovery. Your browser code could be what searches for new addresses. There is code in Copay that does that.
I'm presently creating a wallet that will do BIP32 discovery. Ultimately I intend to get SPV working in the browser (which is possible via Web RTC gateway nodes - long story), but may provide a backend service similar to what you are building as a fall-back. I may use Insight, but I'm also considering the [new address index btcd]( There is also now [watch-only addresses in bitcoin core]( that may also work.

Hey everyone, what happened today was very unfortunate, but I think it makes sense for reddit as a company. This was not surprising for those familiar with what's happening at reddit right now, but for those who are unaware, here's the story.
I was hired as cryptocurency engineer in September, for which I left my job at BitPay. I was won-over by the then-CEO Yishan, who had an awesome vision for the future of reddit, including cryptocurrency as the financial system of the internet city that is reddit. However, Yishan suddenly and unexpectedly resigned his position a month or two later, probably due to exhaustion. This was in the midst of great existing turmoil at the company, such as moving the entire, formerly-remote company to SF, raising a new round of $50 million, and celebgate.
More turmoil followed, and new leadership took over the reins. I have complete confidence in the new leadership, but cryptocurrency is not in their plans. This is not surprising, because they basically have their hands full with all sorts of other stuff. This has nothing to do with the screen shot that was posted the other day.
I'm fairly confident cryptocurrency will return to reddit in the coming years (and of course you can still buy reddit gold with bitcoin), but it will have to wait a while for things to calm down. Meanwhile, best of luck to everyone who will get to witness the new era of reddit from the inside. It was cool to be a part of the historic front-page of the internet, at least for a while. Also, for the record, I'm pretty sure I was the first person in history to have the official title "cryptocurrency engineer".

No. I had one extremely brief meeting with Ellen, and one reasonably long half-hour-or-so meeting with Dan (the new VP of product). I had no meetings with Alexis. I had no opportunity to pitch what I was doing to the new leadership.
FWIW, post-Yishan, I considered whether the best use of my time was to play politics at reddit or write software. I decided to focus on writing software, because if playing politics all day was actually necessary to keep my job, I would probably be better off elsewhere. Sadly that is what happened.

Yes I think you're probably right. In hindsight it's obvious the only way I could have continued at reddit was to go out of my way to communicate with and pitch my work to the new executives. That was my mistake to miss that opportunity. But meanwhile I wrote actually useful and educational software. I couldn't have done both at the same time. Perhaps spending all day pitching bitcoin would have been better. It wouldn't have been as fun though.

Here's an example. The "pay for wireless with bitcoin" idea:
Step 1. Company X makes it easy for anybody to earn bitcoin by making their wireless router or cell phone hotspot publicly accessible.
Step 2. The default settings send 50% of the revenue directly to Company X, which most people don't bother to change because Company X makes it so easy and they like Company X.
Result: Everyone wins. People have an incentive to make their wireless points publicly visible because they earn money. People who want wireless can now access more internet hotspots for cheaper. Company X earns enough revenue to make the next killer idea.
Edit: Credit for this idea goes to Andrew Barisser. Give him money.

FWIW, as I noted in the linked article, "reddit notes", which originally was the unnamed cryptocurrency give-back project, was not actually my idea, and I didn't know I would be working on it until I joined the company. I believe the project was ill-conceived, mostly because it was legally next-to-impossible to execute. Decentralizing reddit achieves the same aim, with far fewer (if any) legal headaches.

I don't want to create a prototype if there is no interest (it takes a lot longer than the two hours or so that it took to write the article). There is obviously interest, so I may do just that.
If you think I'm all theory and no substance - you must not be familiar with my software work. There are many thousands of people that use my code in production.


The users. But if a company is founded to build it, the company will do most of the hosting.


I don't know, but I think people will want to reward content creators. Changetip has been very successful with that model.


You will know you're paying the user who posted the content, because the content will be signed, and you can make a payment to the owner of that key. e.g., without payment channels, you could just derive a new address and send the bitcoins to that address. With payment channels, we would use a hub and spoke mechanism, so, again, you know the payments are going to the correct bitcoin address.
It would still be possible for users to copy other users' content and repost it - I'm not sure how to prevent that. But perhaps there is a way. I'm open to suggestions.
@_date: 2015-07-06 15:15:09

Yes, interesting point. Probably the proof-of-concept would be absolutely minimal and implement almost nothing that reddit currently implements - except links, posts, and uptipping.


Totally agreed. However, this would be the first ever social media web app where users get directly paid for their work. I think there is a huge, huge opportunity to make that a reality. I bet users would love it, if executed correctly.


Yes, I probably should, but people get what reddit is and that it has problems, and that there is an opportunity to fix those problems with this technology.

I'm generally in favor of increasing the block size, but obviously with great caution. We have no official company stance on it. Yes, I think an increased blocksize is necessary for our segregated funds to be as useful as possible. We've run some numbers on this stuff, and in a nutshell, fees are going to be expensive if we starting having full blocks, so we may need to decrease settlement speeds if the blocksize doesn't increase soon enough.

I'm pretty sure we can make it as easy to use as reddit. My vision is for something based on web technologies. This will both make it possible for people to run completely independent nodes, while also making the thing easily accessible (i.e., there will still be a website for people who don't want to bother to clone a github repo).
I've never made a decentralized reddit before either - it will be new for all of us! I don't think anything quite like this has ever existed before, especially considering p2p payments will be integrated. It will be a learning experience for everyone. I think anyone who is passionate about the idea will have something to offer. Deep coding experience is not a requirement.

Our protocol is based on and is similar to the Lightning Network. However, it is not protocol-compatible. My understand is the Lightning protocol is not yet settled. It is possible and desirable that we reconcile our protocols once the "real" Lightning protocol is settled.

Hey friends, just want to answer some questions and clarify a few things. Yours is a platform for getting people paid for creating and discovering good content with bitcoin micropayments. We've had the product working for a while with normal bitcoin transactions, but fees are too high.

Here was an update when we got the micropayments working in a simulated environment: 
Here is a video of the product with normal bitcoin transactions: 
Yours Core is the name of the logic that runs both in a web browser and on the server, and contains our bitcoin wallet implementation. The Yours UI uses Yours Core. We are now in the process of integrating our micropayments technology into Yours Core. We are not finished with this process. As I said in the tweet, we have finished *step 1* of this process, which is to make the funding transaction possible. We have tested that on testnet. There are two other transaction types involved in micropayments: commitment transactions and spending transactions. We have not integrated or tested those in our platform yet.
The reason why the platform is called "Yours" is because it's all about your content. If it's your content and your money, it's Yours.

Would you mind giving more detail? I have used BitInstant and would like to know if it is really worth avoiding them.
@_date: 2012-06-27 16:32:36
Why would anyone choose to use freicoin, where they lose value continuously, when they could use bitcoin, where they do not lose value continuously?
@_date: 2016-09-03 00:48:38
Datt is Yours. If you like Datt, you'll like Yours too.
@_date: 2016-09-12 18:33:34
Hey friends, Ryan X. Charles here, cofounder &amp; CEO of Yours. I can answer any questions you may have :)
@_date: 2016-09-02 19:40:22
We're going to launch in phases, starting with a small invite-only audience on bitcoin testnet. That will occur soon - but we haven't decided on a date yet.
@_date: 2016-09-13 00:41:37
On Day 1, all users will have channels open with the Yours Oracle. All routes are User A -&gt; Oracle -&gt; User B, so routing is trivial. However, we will still need to solve the full routing problem for full decentralization. That will happen sometime after launch.
@_date: 2016-09-02 22:44:31
Exactly - it is very googlable actually.
@_date: 2016-09-13 00:39:17
Our only limits are the transactions that have to be the blockchain. Once you're "in", there are no limits. However, realistically, people will go in and out of the micropayments system regularly. Funding your wallet will require two on-chain transactions, and cashing out takes one.
@_date: 2015-04-25 20:06:51
Yes. The decision was made by cofounder Ben Davenport.
@_date: 2015-04-25 18:22:32
Hey, BitGo engineer here. I feel absolutely terrible that this happened to you. If this is a bug with the recovery tool, we will refund you 85 BTC. I'm investigating what happened and will post more information here soon.
@_date: 2015-04-17 21:40:21
"Sr. iOS Devloper" - I think I found your guy: 
@_date: 2015-04-25 20:16:03
I'm still investigating, so it's definitely possible, and would be quite a coincidence otherwise. However the numbers used are not 32 bit ints, but 64 bit floats, which do not have the same overflow problem. But I still haven't found the error, so I don't know yet. The recovery tool also retrieves data from third party APIs, so it's possible something went wrong with one of the APIs.
@_date: 2015-04-25 20:07:11
Thanks for the info, that's useful. Right now I'm basically reading through the source code of the txRebuild() function and marking it up trying to figure out where a miscalculation may have happened.
For others reading this, note that the recovery tool in question is for legacy wallets only, and does not affect most BitGo users, since most users are using the new HD wallet format. There is a completely different recovery tool for those wallets.
@_date: 2015-04-25 23:47:27
Thanks a lot!
@_date: 2015-04-25 20:31:32
The recovery tool is written in javascript, which only has one built-in number type, 64 bit floating points. Happy to debate the merits of javascript another time, but either way, whatever the problem is, 32 bit int overflow is unlikely in this case.
@_date: 2015-04-25 23:27:30
Turns out the problem was a 32 bit int overflow problem after all. The recovery tool was using an outdated version of bitcoinjs-lib that did a right shift on values, converting them to 32 bit ints. Will post more info soon.
Edit: Ben Chan posted the gory details here: 
@_date: 2015-09-01 17:46:42
Yep. witcoin.
@_date: 2016-10-20 19:38:45


Yeah that sounds like a pretty fair characterization. Would love to do an AMA - perhaps sometime around our general launch. That will be early 2017.
@_date: 2016-10-20 15:21:13
segwit and a block size increase are not mutually exclusive. I think both are necessary in the short-/medium-term. Long-term perhaps there are other ways to scale bitcoin that don't require increasing the block size. However, the situation is totally outside of our control, so we have hedged to be able to launch no matter what happens. With or without segwit or a block size increase.
@_date: 2016-10-20 15:19:34
To the users, it's just a website.
Our code is all node.js/javascript, written in an isomorphic way so that everything that runs in a browser also runs on a server.
@_date: 2016-10-20 19:42:16
Thanks :)
Not sure about downvoting - we haven't figured out a way to do that that makes sense. But we think the real answer is empowering our users to figure out the right way to do things like that for their subcommunities/submarkets.
@_date: 2015-04-25 20:56:49
Thanks a lot for your patience. We're trying to rebuild the situation on testnet right now. I'll let you know what we learn.
@_date: 2016-10-20 18:16:16
No, we will default to dollars and other local fiat currencies. Yes, this means your balance will fluctuate with the price of bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-10-20 16:25:31
"force"? You are free to implement such a client yourself, but if there is only 0.01% customer demand we can't justify the extra time and effort that would take for us to implement.
@_date: 2016-10-20 15:22:30
Ha, never heard that one before. We will revisit the logo when the time is right.
@_date: 2015-04-25 19:23:27
That's probably not it, since the legacy recovery tool does not use 32 bit ints.
@_date: 2016-10-20 03:32:57


Yes. Malleability doesn't prevent the system from functioning, but it is a very irritating problem that AFAIK can only be solved with segwit.


We've tuned the required confirmations to 0 for testing/demo purposes :)


The company does. Theoretically with the social product we will earn enough money to be able to afford this. The long-term answer is to have many Alices.


Privacy is not one of our goals. Assume all transactions are public.


Maybe long-term, definitely not at first. Our goal is the minimal thing that works for launch.


It uses the user's full normal bitcoin balance to fund their channel. For the oracle, it uses 10,000 bits (~$6). We'll figure out the best way to handle this with time.


Yes, you can close a channel at any time and get your money.
@_date: 2016-10-20 18:13:44
The curation model is just one model. The real power of the platform is in letting moderators pick the economic rules for their communities. e.g., imagine something like Shutterstock, but where anybody can post an image and you can see the preview and buy the full resolution version for 10 cents. Enabling that feature for moderators is relatively easy once we have micropayments working. The curation model is good for bootstrapping.
@_date: 2016-10-20 18:16:43
Thanks Ian :)
@_date: 2016-10-20 03:48:44
It's not accurate to say "you have to trust Alice". This system is trust-minimized. And yes, we will be adopting segwit when possible.
As for privacy concerns, note that we are a social product first, and bitcoin wallet second. Our users don't care about privacy of their transactions - everything is public.
@_date: 2016-10-20 15:21:35
I think seeing other people earn money will inspire our users to up their game.
@_date: 2016-10-05 02:12:05
I'm teaching a weekly class on programming bitcoin stuff that you might find valuable. 
@_date: 2015-03-22 21:24:47
No, if a transaction does not have enough signatures, then it is invalid, and won't be relayed by the (bitcoin) network. There either needs to be a parallel p2p network, or a server that stores the transactions, or the peers need to communicate directory to each other.
@_date: 2016-10-20 03:49:40
Long-term, yes. For the early versions, no.
@_date: 2015-03-17 20:26:25
It would be great if you could add BitGo to the list, if you're the owner.
@_date: 2015-03-22 21:51:29






In principle, yes, but extending the bitcoin p2p protocol and getting everyone to adopt your changes it not trivial.
@_date: 2016-10-20 15:53:06
The company runs an Insight server that the users use to interact with the blockchain. Technically it would be possible for users to use their own Insight instance, but I think almost no one would do that, so we haven't implemented support for that and probably won't.
@_date: 2016-10-20 15:18:31
Alice and all other users rely on using our company's Insight server to access the blockchain. Theoretically each user could run their own full node for this, but that is not something we have implemented.
@_date: 2015-03-14 04:09:13
It's interesting how when some people start to understand, they only go part way, and don't realize the full potential of bitcoin is to replace the entire legacy financial system, not just replace part of it.
@_date: 2015-03-22 15:08:06
This is something we've wanted to do in the multisig world for a while, but no one has yet designed a communication protocol for this to work smoothly.
@_date: 2016-10-20 15:17:23
With our polling-based messaging system, no. However, we will probably upgrade our messaging system to use sockets, which will go much faster. Probably 10ms will still be too small, but probably every 200ms or so is possible. Theoretically, there is no limit (other than physical limits like the speed of light) - the limits are just software architecture problems.
@_date: 2016-10-20 03:51:16
For the first version, the user will have to log in regularly to monitor their channels. Long-term, we will provide a service that does the monitoring.
@_date: 2015-02-01 03:09:09
Awesome! Will check it out.
edit: I read the description, and indeed, it sounds exceptionally similar. If it's too similar, I wouldn't be interested in competing with you guys, and I'll come up with another idea. Great work!
@_date: 2016-10-20 14:58:27
Increasing the block size and segwit are not mutually exclusive. Unfortunately it is true that BU as implemented does not simultaneously support segwit.
@_date: 2015-02-01 04:01:55
Yep. As I said to the other comment: What happened is a certain anti-bitcoin subreddit has latched onto me as King Bitcoin and they troll everything I say and do, including most especially this post. They hoard downvote every positive post.
@_date: 2015-03-22 19:25:46
Yes, the HD structures either need to the the same, or compatible. Also, there needs to be a common communication protocol so that my wallet can easily tell yours that there is a transaction waiting to be signed.
@_date: 2015-02-01 04:51:05
lol. You guys have more threads about me than You're making this about me.
@_date: 2015-02-01 03:45:34
Yes, partnering with a company that has a bunch of hotspots would be perfect!
@_date: 2015-02-01 03:19:44
Thanks a lot for your very detailed response. I am not familiar with OpenWRT, but that is quite possibly the correct approach.
@_date: 2015-02-01 03:46:07
Thanks a lot! For what it's worth, it turns out the guys at  are doing something highly similar. So similar in fact that I may just tip the hat to them and I'll do something different.
@_date: 2015-02-26 17:58:10
Thanks ... I re-read the article looking for the name of the company or the people involved, and that was oddly missing.
@_date: 2015-02-01 02:51:19
The people who run the apps will be responsible for knowing if it is against the TOS of ISPs, just like people who rent their apartments on AirBnB are the ones responsible for knowing if their rental agreement allows it.
@_date: 2015-02-01 05:09:11
lol. Thanks for your concern, but I'm sure I'll be all right. These guys look great, and I'm extremely optimistic about their project!
@_date: 2015-02-01 04:09:25
Um, yeah, of course, if we do it! Note however that I've since learned another company is doing something extremely similar: 
....I would not want to harm their chances, so if there isn't enough room in the market for me too, I'll have to come up with a different idea.
@_date: 2015-02-01 02:49:45
Yes, the idea is quite old. And it is basically a missed opportunity. No one has really tried to do it yet.
@_date: 2015-02-01 04:30:56
Vitalik pointed out a really great way to do this that is better than what I described. The app should be something you just run on your laptop, and it makes a wireless bridge to whatever network your laptop is connected to. This would solve the problem 90% of the time way less headache than worrying about routers at all.
@_date: 2015-02-01 05:06:43
Yep. I was unaware of the existence of this project. I think these guys look great, and I'm not too keen on directly competing with another bitcoin company. I think it's better if we all do distinct functions and not compete with each other. So if I do something wireless, it will be different than them. With that being said, the notion of "bitcoin wireless" probably has room for many companies.
@_date: 2015-02-01 02:55:37
There is nothing "classic" about this. I think you'll notice if you actually read my original plan, there is a very explicit, revenue-generating business plan, which is the entire purpose of starting the company. Although the software will be open-source, the default settings will send a portion of the revenue to Bitcoin Wireless. Most people will not bother to change the default settings.
@_date: 2015-02-01 03:06:45
Thanks, I will look into that. The weird proxy thing is just an easy way to make a proof-of-concept. It's almost certainly not the way most people will actually use Bitcoin Wireless.
@_date: 2015-03-16 16:47:17
Wat? There are no transaction fees for normal users.
@_date: 2015-02-01 02:50:36
That's part of the goal. Making life better for everyone by making bitcoin easy for everyone to use.
@_date: 2015-02-01 04:03:06
I'm familiar with Foxtrot, and that is not what this is like at all. Foxtrot is about creating a meshnet layer on top of the existing internet that can be paid for with bitcoin, and maybe one day will be extended to a physical meshnet. Bitcoin Wireless however is about wireless internet on Day 1.
@_date: 2015-02-01 05:23:15
All of the browser-side stuff will be done in javascript, but I've been tempted a lot recently by both Go and Rust, so I may prefer one of those for the backend stuff.
@_date: 2015-02-01 06:31:13
In the best possible way!
@_date: 2015-02-01 04:25:14
Yes that's probably correct. If this became popular, the ISPs would probably make it an issue and want to get it to stop. The way to prevent that is to 1) Pay the ISPs by bringing them into the revenue loop. 2) Replace the internet with a decentralized meshnet. ISPs as we currently understand them no longer exist.
@_date: 2015-02-01 03:34:24
Yes, I think you're right. Your idea is more the spirit of what I was trying to do. A very simple app, downloaded to a laptop, and the person with the laptop can simply make their laptop a forwarded WiFi hotspot. If the other guys doing the very similar thing, (  ) , are not doing this, maybe that's what I will do.
@_date: 2015-02-01 04:21:40
Yeah, MP3s were bad for music third parties, but they weren't bad for artists, no? Music has never been more alive than today. Open technology is better for everyone. If your business depends on owning something that can be made irrelevant by open-source software, you're doing it wrong.
@_date: 2015-02-01 03:28:27
@_date: 2015-02-01 03:08:01
Quite possibly, I'm not sure. If that is the case, we will have to warn people who download the app that they are responsible for understanding their contract with their ISP, and they will take on the risk if this is a breach of that.
@_date: 2015-02-01 04:07:40
Ooh, that's a great idea! I love the idea of integrating with Google Maps so you can know where to jump to next to continue having internet access.
@_date: 2015-02-01 04:49:35
Agreed, that would be a good feature. You could force them to be on a VPN by, say, making sure they are directly connecting to a known VPN and only that known VPN.
@_date: 2015-02-01 04:47:47
Agreed that flashing firmware makes things harder. Vitalik had a great idea in this thread which I think is better which is you should just run an app on your laptop that makes your laptop's internet publically accessible, which is probably possible with most wifi cards. I followed you on twitter. Send me a DM!
@_date: 2015-02-01 02:44:47
Our work will be completely open-source. It will not be possible to undercut us, as we will develop everything as cheaply as possible.
@_date: 2015-02-01 03:39:09
Yes, it's similar, but they're missing the key ingredient: bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-01 04:05:30
Yes! I did not know they existed, but what they are doing is extremely similar. I wish them the best of luck. If what they are doing is too similar, I will opt to let them have the market and I will do something else.
@_date: 2015-02-01 02:42:08
Yes, exactly. The best use case is probably traveling.
@_date: 2015-02-01 02:44:09


This is nothing like Boingo.


Leverage technology first, and find customers second. Not the other way around.
@_date: 2015-02-01 04:08:32
I think over the long run it would ultimately become the defacto way to pay for internet access. Wireless signals are available, and your computer automatically negotiates to get the best rate, and you pay with bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-01 03:43:52
Yes! All those configurations of course would definitely be possible. A lot of people would want to block criminal content so as to limit liability.
@_date: 2015-02-01 03:46:57
Thanks a lot for the link. Look forward to reading it.
@_date: 2015-02-01 04:13:10
Yeah, people can always go to Starbucks, but wouldn't it be 1000 times easier if you could just pay to access one of the zillions of wireless routers you can see from your hotel room, so that you don't have to go anywhere?
@_date: 2015-02-20 02:37:17
A place to spend my bytcoin!
@_date: 2015-02-01 03:39:19
Yep! That would be awesome.
@_date: 2015-02-01 02:49:26
Sure, agreed, but it's a lot easier to solve a problem that basically requires writing an app (and a later version will ultimately require getting software onto the routers themselves - a problem we can solve later).
@_date: 2015-02-03 17:56:35
I was let go, and the project is indefinitely shelved. Explanation here: 
@_date: 2015-02-01 02:47:49
I honestly hadn't though of that, but I'm more interested for the immediate future in finding revenue-generating business plans.
@_date: 2015-02-01 03:28:00
Yes, this is definitely a valid concern. However I think it is analogous to the problem of visitors destroying an AirBnB rental. I think the way to solve this may be with some type of insurance.
@_date: 2015-02-01 03:05:01
Yes, that's the exact idea of crowdfunding. Our future customers are funding us now. Note that bitcoin naturally provides the type of incentive you are talking about. The people that crowdfund us almost certainly will own bitcoin, which will rise in value a little higher a little sooner if Bitcoin Wireless takes off.
@_date: 2015-02-01 04:01:36
What happened is a certain anti-bitcoin subreddit has latched onto me as King Bitcoin and they troll everything I say and do, including most especially this post. They hoard downvote every positive post.
@_date: 2015-02-01 04:50:15
Thanks, someone else mentioned dd-wrt and I'm investigating it.
@_date: 2015-02-01 02:48:36
fullnode has an (IMO) better interface, has faster cryptography. Hopefully soon it will have SPV and full node support, but right now I would recommend people use either bitcoinjs or bitcore instead of fullnode.
@_date: 2016-07-14 17:50:45
Thanks for your input :) I think that's a fine argument, but my experience actually talking about this project with non-blockchain people showed "Yours" was the better name for a mainstream audience, but the sample size was low. We'll see what happens when we actually launch.
@_date: 2015-02-01 03:31:18
I'm open to that, although I don't see how that would be better. We simply need payments, and bitcoin already exists with a stronger network effect.
@_date: 2015-02-01 03:26:23
Yes. That's just a prototype description to show that it easy to make something that works to show people it is technically possible. The right approach, as many others are suggesting here, may be to edit the firmware.
@_date: 2015-02-01 02:46:56
Thanks a lot! Yes, I think there is liability, but it is not fundamentally different than AirBnB or Uber. The liability is not a fatal problem.
@_date: 2015-02-01 03:21:57
Yes, I think baking into firmware is definitely the ultimate goal. I will have to research all the relevant technologies before deciding which technology is best for v1 prototype.
@_date: 2015-02-03 17:50:49
No. Explanation here: 
@_date: 2015-02-01 02:56:09
I completely agree. This could be truly frictionless internet available everywhere. Bitcoin payments is the right way to solve this problem.
@_date: 2015-02-01 02:41:45
I think this is wrong. This is not about home internet access, but about getting internet to every place on the planet. With Bitcoin Wireless, people would have an incentive to set up routers all over the world and get paid. You could travel on a Safari and have cheap internet the whole time with this. Not to mention communities where most people can't afford home internet.
@_date: 2016-07-14 23:26:51
"Yours" makes more sense to a mainstream audience. We actually put a lot of effort into finding the right name, and everybody outside r/bitcoin loves "Yours".
@_date: 2015-02-01 03:43:04
I think Vitalik's idea, mentioned here in this thread, is probably the right approach. Instead of worrying about routers, just make an app that you run on your laptop that makes your laptop's WiFi available. I'm fairly sure that would be possible with anybody's existing hardware.
@_date: 2015-02-01 04:23:00
Yes, that would be possible. Of course everyone should have a VPN to make that not possible. But that's not a business I'm trying to get into.
@_date: 2015-02-08 20:59:06
@_date: 2015-02-01 02:46:21
I think it will be much better for the community if it is open-source. There is no reason to keep anything proprietary. By having the moral authority as the company that made it happen, we will have success like other open-source companies. An interested analogy is the fashion industry, where the leading companies have many imitators, but nonetheless have no problems with customers, because some customers want the real thing. Imitators are not an issue.
@_date: 2015-02-01 04:48:39
Because people get paid, they have an incentive to set up spots all over the place. It would be like a more bottom-up approach to putting ISPs all over the place.
@_date: 2015-02-01 03:30:49
Don't underestimate the power of Default Settings if you make something really easy to use.
@_date: 2015-02-01 02:50:09
Because your cell phone internet access doesn't work everywhere, isn't fast enough, and is too expensive.
@_date: 2016-07-14 15:39:44
"Datt" makes sense if you're marketing only to people in the blockchain community, but "Yours" is much more appealing to a mainstream audience. That is why we changed.
See: 
@_date: 2015-02-01 03:40:38
Totally agree with you. If you read the explanation, you'll see that by paying in advance, you get exactly that quantity of bandwidth that you pay for available to you once it goes live.
@_date: 2015-02-01 04:29:39
Yep! That's part of what makes this great and possible. Privacy-preserving p2p payments.
@_date: 2015-02-01 03:35:50
I think about them a lot and how to make the world a better place in spite of them.
@_date: 2016-07-14 19:04:08
Thank you for your input.
@_date: 2015-02-01 03:29:03
There are many ways to solve this. Payment channels, proof-of-bitcoin, multisig with escrow, etc.
@_date: 2015-02-01 02:45:03
There is no reason to keep it closed-source. Open-source on Day 1.
@_date: 2016-07-14 21:18:23
Don't bring my father into this.
@_date: 2015-02-03 17:13:42
I posted an explanation here: 
@_date: 2016-07-04 16:06:30
Now that I'm my own boss, my project can't be doomed by others' mismanagement :)
Datt = Yours.

@_date: 2016-07-04 16:05:32
@_date: 2015-02-01 05:38:22
Yes exactly!
@_date: 2015-02-01 04:52:05
Thanks, that's a really good suggestion.
@_date: 2016-07-04 16:05:19
We think it would be cool if people could get paid with bitcoin micropayments for producing internet content. So we're making an app that incentivizes people to make payments to creators. For this to be possible, we must also design and implement our own micropayment protocol based on Lightning Network theory.

Wow, thanks for your extremely high quality comment! I like the idea of combining the HTLC into the checksig - I think I understand how that's possible, but will need to ruminate on it a bit more. We will definitely factor this stuff into our design. Long-term we hope to be compatible with whatever the standard ends up being for Lightning.

This is part of the myth of democracy. The people responsible for government are the people actually making decisions and performing actions for the government, not ordinary people who happen to live within the territory that government claims it has a monopoly on violence over.
With that being said, I do agree that participating in bitcoin is subversive.

Fantastic idea. IMO the best way to get this done is to do it yourself. Learn how to program. Here are some technologies you could learn to use to implement this:
express (for node.js)
twitter bootstrap
Learn what these are and put them together and your can make your idea. That's exactly what I'm doing, except on my own idea rather than this one.

I believe that is correct. Additionally, the bitcoin address does not even expose the public key. It is the hash of the public key. And quantum computers are not fundamentally better at breaking hashes.

Better to accidentally receive 10 BTC than send 10 BTC.
@_date: 2013-01-14 17:21:54
Excellent point - perception matters. One way to accept bitcoin then while mostly maintaining perception is to subtly hide the option, perhaps by having an "alternate payment options" button. This wouldn't do much to advertise bitcoin to the ignorant, but it would still allow people to pay with bitcoin if they so choose. People who actually want to pay with bitcoin would probably think to click the "alternate payment options" button and would be delighted to see bitcoin as an option.

Why would they do that when they can confiscate bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-09-29 13:35:30
The money supply is an irrelevant number, since prices for things can change. The distribution of purchasing power is what matters. When the Fed creates new money, or when fractional reserve banks create new money, they are taking purchasing power from people who have money and giving it to the people who get the new money. It is not necessary to create new money - it's just a subtle form of theft.
@_date: 2013-07-07 17:32:53
Ha, awesome, I had the exact same idea but hadn't gotten around to implementing it yet. Good work.

Acknowledged. It's a tough problem.


The same argument could be made for using the dollar over bitcoin. Maybe a better solution is to learn from the mistakes of the past to make an entirely new system.

I just did the same. My only problem is Namecheap waits ~1hr (presumably 6 confirmations) before your bitcoin funds are deposited. This is kind of annoying since if they built their system specifically for bitcoin, purchases would be instant (in the event the transaction doesn't make it through 6 confirmations, they could revoke their services). Still, it's great that they take bitcoin.

The way to utilise bitcoin for large transfers is to hold bitcoin and not do conversions to fiat currencies. Then the fees are negligible, and the convenience is extremely high.

No, I'm not freaking out. The opposite. I fully expect small centralized organizations that support monetary liberty, like Liberty Reserve, to be shut down by governments. Meanwhile, I fully expect bitcoin to march on in spite of all government attacks.

A lot of people will tell you this is risky, but risk is subjective. I trust you've thoroughly researched bitcoin and understand what you're getting into, and therefore understand that bitcoin is far less risky that most uninformed outsiders would have you believe. Welcome to the club.
@_date: 2013-05-23 13:36:42
No. At the time I believed there could only be one because competitors could be 51% attackers by bitcoin miners and destroyed. What I missed was that an altcoin, like litecoin, could use a fundamentally different hashing algorithm that can't be attacked by bitcoin miners. So there dan be more that one if they use significantly different hashing algorithms.
@_date: 2013-03-01 16:45:25
It's right. When you create a transaction, you broadcast the public key, which can be hashed to find that it corresponds to the address.

It most certainly is not, since these powerful people have created a situation that they can't get out. The only thing they can do is delay the inevitable, which is what they are doing. Bitcoin can work in the long run. The dollar can't.


Actually, only a small elite benefit from the dollar. Most people would be better with bitcoin, which is why they will adopt bitcoin instead.

1. "Only invest what you can afford to lose" goes for fiat as well. Some of us believe bitcoin is less risky than fiat, and thus prefer to keep our savings in bitcoin. 
2. Diversify in proportion to your judgment of the quality of different assets. It's reasonable to be all-in bitcoin if you judge it to be the best of all assets you are aware of.
3. Definitely use cold storage.

I believe bitcoin will play a more significant role in the future of commerce than the US dollar, and in fact I further believe that all fiat currencies will suffer hyperinflation as bitcoin replaces them for internet commerce, international trade, and other economic activities (although fiat currencies may still exist for local trade - I'm not sure). So I'm a bitcoin true believer. However, I recognize that I may be wrong, so I try to read the criticisms of bitcoin in case I have missed something important. It's rare that I read a criticism and don't roll my eyes because the critic has misunderstood some basic element of bitcoin. You are pointing out a feature of many criticisms - many critics absolutely hate bitcoin with a passion. I don't know why they have such strong feelings against bitcoin, but their feelings don't change the plausibility of bitcoin dominating commerce in the future.
@_date: 2013-08-03 17:26:11


Not only will they let the dollar fall to zero, they are actively pursuing that option by printing spectacular amounts of money. Their interest is not in maintaining the value of the dollar. Their interest is in maintaining their control of the financial system. They will try this will all their might, but they will not be able to overcome the market forces that choose bitcoin.


There's no doomsday, just the collapse of the fiat currency financial system. Life will go on.
And there is a need to educate people about these facts, since this information is useful in determining how and to what extent to get involved in bitcoin.
