If it doesn't break Bitcoin, which it doesn't seem to, and certain devs agree to stop blocking the stream of transactions (at least temporarily) because they get something they want, I say go for it. Consensus inherently requires compromise with contentious issues. Most of the small-blockers want to kill SPV, and I don't disagree with them on that. It's quite insecure. Having a middle ground between SPV and a full node would help reduce the number of SPV clients. Fully-validating nodes still have to transmit 4MB of data either way, though, so segwit seems more like a political solution that appeals to the interests of Blockstream than an actual scalability solution. 
It's really nothing more than BIP 102 with some shiny pork attached to it to help achieve consensus. I don't buy the fearmongering about hard forks. BIP66 was more problematic than the hard forks during Bitcoin's history, and it was a soft fork.
I might disagree wholeheartedly with the small-block vision of Bitcoin, but I'm not trying to disparage the political nature of segwit. It's no different from any other political issue in human history. I just don't like that nobody's calling a spade a spade. If you think segwit is a proper scalability solution, you should think BIP 102 is, too, and if you don't, you either care more about extension blocks and malleability than small blocks, or you're being misled by an ingenious rebranding of jgarzik's proposal.

Miners can't choose to mine larger blocks if they choose right now. It's ironic that you're suggesting miners and nodes should dictate the block size. Keeping the status quo deprives them of that freedom.

After stepping away from the project for over five years to allow a more decentralized governance to evolve, why on earth would he do that? It seems to me like he was terrified of being Kim Dotcom'ed by the CIA, and that's becoming less of a threat to him with each passing day. Bitcoin's gone mainstream at this point. If he's really Satoshi, he deserves to be able to continue his work. 
Besides, he's one man. There's one for-profit corporation with far more influence on Core development at this point.

Your views are completely contradictory. You refuse to support bigger blocks. In fact, you've called for smaller blocks in the past. This kills Bitcoin as a currency. Lightning isn't going to fix that, it's vaporware, and it's not going to scale past ~100 tps anyhow. Now, you're killing non-monetary uses of Bitcoin, too. What use case of Bitcoin do you support? The one where R3 buys out your employer and makes you a millionaire?

Blockstream's stranglehold on Core just got a little weaker. I can't say I'm upset. 
I do hope Wladimir's comment is just a generic excuse and not a sign that he's sick or something, though. Despite my difference of opinion regarding the block size, he definitely contributed more to BTC than I ever will,  and I wish him the best. I'm just glad there's one less small-block zealot on the commit list.

Wired is a lot more credible than Newsweek, and the evidence they present is pretty damn compelling.

Why would you post this on Reddit instead of talking to a lawyer? If this is real, delete this, idiot.

To be fair, we're not talking about an Average Joe working under the table. We're talking about ~$450M USD in BTC, which is roughly $20 per Australian citizen. 
I'm not defending the raid, it doesn't seem like there's nearly enough evidence yet for police action to be taken against our possible Satoshi, but I'm just saying, you're making it sound like they raided a waitress for undeclared tips...

No need to apologize. Skepticism is a good thing, especially when it comes to this subreddit.

The size of individual blocks is already decided by miners. It's why certain pools mine empty blocks while the mempool is stacked full. Nodes can refuse to broadcast low-fee txs, and miners can choose to continue to mine 500KB blocks if they so please. They don't need more control than that. The maximum block size is just that -- a maximum.

I remember when this sub thought Ulbrict was incredibly sloppy, yet now, some people think Wright did this by mistake. 
Wired and Gizmodo had a mountain of evidence, albeit none of it conclusive. I don't think they'll become the next Newsweek.

Ideally, we all want exponential growth, but with the current state of bandwidth out of China, it's rather reckless to lock into. In the short term, we need bigger blocks. It's the future everyone's uncertain about, and the nice thing about a linear model is that relative growth slows with each year. If bandwidth winds up being less of an issue due to a variety of factors, we can always fork again. This is a fantastic compromise in the meantime.
Have you considered taking the lead role on Core? It'd be great if we could have a moderate like yourself in that role after departure.

Full nodes still have to transmit the same amount of data (4MB). Segwit prevents malleability and allows for a block-only node to be run which uses far less bandwidth. Frankly, this is a political solution masquerading as a scalability solution. It's tying a bunch of very-useful pork to a block size increase, and it's playing off the (IMO, meaningless) distinction between soft and hard forks. Everyone seems to forget how smoothly the one hard fork in Bitcoin's history went compared to BIP66's soft fork. 
This is how consensus is formed in all political systems. I'm not trying to trash segwit, but the way it's being marketed is incredibly confusing to less-technical users. It's just jgarzik's BIP 102 with a one-time 4MB increase and some additional pork.

Say what you will about &lt;REDACTED&gt;, but the block size issue had been stonewalled for years. If the controversial nature of  &lt;REDACTED&gt; motivated the other devs to actually do something, I'd say that's a success for Gavin.

If you can use their exchange instead of their brokerage, the fees drop to 0.25% for market orders.
@_date: 2015-12-14 07:05:55
Even as a supporter of bigger blocks, this makes sense to me. There should be a minimum fee for consuming network bandwidth. Nodes shouldn't be broadcasting spam to the entire network.
