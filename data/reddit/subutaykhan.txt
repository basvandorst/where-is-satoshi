What do you mean return ? you wanna sell your bitcoins ever ? I hope you sell at the tops and buy back at the bottoms. More bitcoins

Long Term..altcoins ?. No

In my opinion selling at tops and buying back at lows is also work. Reading, researching, analysing everyday like Benjamin graham or warren Buffet did or still does a stock is really interesting. Watch milton Bergs Video with truevision on youtube. Investing in Stocks or crypto currencies is real work. Its not just holding.

Guys what do you think about the yield inversion. Many people say that historically 1 year after the yield inversion there has always been a economic crisis. How would that affect bitcoin since we will go sideways this year ?

But isnt that risky ? How long was bitcoin in the 200 dollar accumulation Range? How long in the 3k-4k accumulation range ? Long enough ! If i put it into tether and wait for a year there is a risk it might get hacked or the exchange get hacked. If i withdraw the money i have enough time to onboard again. So what if it takes a week ? Im Kind scared to hold my tether on an exchange...or can i have tether on Trezor ? What i would do is withdraw my money and then i have almost a year time to "update" the Limits on the particular exchange. Am i wrong ?

That is why many companies Split their Stocks so that people are more motivated to buy. In my opinion it would be a very smart Marketing move if exchanges and other platforms sit Down together and market the Term satoshi or sats rather then saying "you are buying 0.001 bitcoin" .

My Problem is that the way davinci said it he meant like when bitcoin reaches 100k or 1 million. But in my opinion even at 1 million there is still so much money in the world that is parked in Different Markets trillions and trillions of dollars where you have 0.1 to lets say 2% growth...that growth is nothing. On top of that bitcoin isnt just stuff thats Shiny ..with layer 2, 3 solutions you can have so many things that can be programmed on top of bitcoin.

Back then there were no ETFs manipulating the price. You couldnt short it. After 20k everything changed and  that is why the stock to flow prediction is flawed. Everyone else is just trying to sell their bags.

There are a Lot of people who made money investing and he is not the First human in this world to realize that infinite money printing is bad. I just to like him when i was 15 because he talked about the truth about the federeal Reserve. But it is just embarrassing how he is shamelessly Schilling his gold Website  bitcoiners know the value of assets like gold no one denies that. But either he is acting like this on purpose or he is an Idiot. Both are bad.

I dont remember the exact date but i think i beard about bitcoin First on RT in 2013 and back then i was starting to get super interested in the economy and conspiracy Theories about the Rothschilds and so on. Many right things that i learned but also many wrong things ..i was young. So i watch this clip on RT about Bitcoin with Max Keiser and unfortunately i had all this Information/Propaganda in my head that the Governments want to bring Digital Currency and microchip people and distract from the fact that Gold is real money. I knew about the whole history of how governments debased currencies and even limited or forbid the purchase of Gold. So for me it was clear....All of a sudden the Mainstream Media talks about bitcoin and they want to make it attractive to the people. I believed it was a Tool to enslave people. I wish i looked more into it to learn that it is the exact opposite. But back then there was no talk about how bitcoin is against the banking system. They just talked about how you could have money on the phone....wow how interesting. It really pisses me off sometimes how much i researched and knew at that time about the economy and history more than my friends but i just didnt look more into bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-01 13:07:13
Im pretty certain banks are accumulating bitcoin right now because they know what could Happen to the price in 1 or 2 years. Buy low sell high.

It is not important what is used as money. Gold is too scarce to be a good money. Silver is better. It could even be a wooden Stick like the tally stick. The important issue is who controls the money Supply and how much is issued. Gold is easily suppressed and manipulated.

I think you feel miserable because that goal of reaching that certain amount of money which many people can never dream about has been achieved and that was the only dream you had. That is a mistake. Look at billionaires ..why do they keep going ? Are they happy ?. They are motivated as hell no matter how much money they jave because they dont have a fix goal of 100k or 1m. Dont set yourself one final goal. There are so many things you can still achieve. You can start a business or multiple businesses and become even more successful ..whatever your inner voice tells you you have to have a vision in life. If your only vision is retiring early.. well as you see youv'e done that so what now ? Keep going. You can fund so many things. You can start a small indie gaming start up with just a little money down. You can do whatever you want now. Im sorry to say this i dobt want to hurt anyone bit i personally think that people who get depressed after making a lot of money have no vision and creativity. Look at all those lottery winners who's only dream in life it was to buy a house...so now they buy 10 houses and they dont understand why they are unhappy. Its because they dont even realize what they could get rolling with that money. I personally would never stop. Im interested in gaming, movies, clothing business ..so many things you can do.
