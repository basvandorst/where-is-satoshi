It’s been close to 24 hours now and it’s not in my account. The block chain says “unconfirmed transaction”. I didn’t pay that much in fees. Could that have something to do with it?

As in, I profited on my investment, so should I take that profit amount and buy more bitcoin?

Thank you. I'm using Gemini. I guess it's stored in their cloud? Is that safe?

Thank you so much for all of this information. OK I think I'm understanding a little bit better. So Hypothetically speaking if the price of bit coin goes up, I profit, and want to buy more bitcoin with that increase in value, I sell that small fraction to gain the USD and buy more (which is my goal).

Thank you! Done!

Hi all. First timer here. I've been admiring and watching this exciting ride and decided to buy in at 3400. Should I reinvest the returns? Anything to keep in mind as a newb? I'm using Gemini.

If someone is making a profit right now with this surge, should they reinvest that profit back into BTC while it's still high?

Sorry, like I said I'm new and still getting the language down. I haven't sold any bitcoin, the value of my bitcoin investment went up. I want to take that rise and put it back in. My question is is it better to put that fraction back in, or withdraw the cash to recoup my investment.

I saw an alert on the site earlier today about temporary maintenance. Let's hope it's back on sooner than later. Now I see the importance of moving BTC into a wallet.

Hi. Just bought my first fraction of a BTC at 3400. New to the world. Have been wanting to get in for a while now. Should I reinvest my returns? Anything to keep in mind as a newb?
@_date: 2017-09-17 15:51:41
Ok thanks. Worth buying at the $255 it's at now? 
@_date: 2017-09-16 01:34:08
Thank you so much. I appreciate the insight :)

Hmm, now what if breadwallet gets affected? It still sounds like the BTC are stored elsewhere?
@_date: 2017-09-16 01:13:25
Hmm ok. Does that require additional app/software? Am I trading speed and convenience of trading time for security? Am I using Gemini to buy/sell and bread wallet to store it?

Just downloaded it. Thanks.

When I contacted (TD), the suspicious transactions had other people's names attached to them (of which I wrote down). But those could be innocent people caught up in something like this too.. wouldn't someone having my account and routing number (like that on a checkbook) be enough to forge my identity and gain access to that account to make purchases?

Thanks for this. What should I do now? Is this whole wifi network compromised? Or just my machine? Is my BTC safe on electrum right now? Is my ETH safe on Gemini? Ideally, I would like to put both of these on my ledger nano s.
