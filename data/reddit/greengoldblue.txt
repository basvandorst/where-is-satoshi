"..for those who want to transmit money overseas without bearing any exchange rate risk ... the key would be to build exchanges that offer options contracts. It would work as follows. The sender goes onto a local Bitcoin exchange in her home country and buys 10 bitcoins. Simultaneously, the receiver goes onto a local Bitcoin exchange for his local currency and purchases an option to sell Bitcoins at the then-prevailing exchange rate at any time in the next couple of hours. Then the sender transmits the Bitcoins and the receiver exercises his option."
How viable is this? I think it is an awesome idea when attempting to transmit BTC internationally without being at the mercy of BTC price fluctuations.

Is there a transaction fee when withdrawing from a ATM? For example, if I use Bank A's Debit Card to withdraw from Bank B's ATM machine, there is usually a charge between $1.50 to $5 (the higher fee ones usually being private ATMs like in gas stations and bars).
