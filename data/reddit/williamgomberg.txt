So, not buying his album made me hundreds!
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:33:53
Me too.  I want to buy in low to bring my average cost/btc down so I can profit even if it only reaches a bit over 10k.. tough times and I only have 20% of my total dedicated cash reserved for BTC left right now.  want to put it in low but it's so unpredictable

Asia going easy on us
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:26:23
I agree it is difficult.  I've Dollar Cost Averaged these last few days and the overall average I payed is 10200$/btc... not too bad, but Im also debating when i should buy more and how low it'll go.  Im open to suggestions but of course no one really knows!

Do you guys think Asia is gonna bring the price higher or lower (short term)? Bought in at 9500, debating if I should put in a bit more now and HODL, or wait a few hours and buy the rest then.

Crypto is very risky.  However, I do see potential in it.  What I'd recommend, right now, is to HODL.  If you're overly worried all the time, maybe even sell your bitcoin next time it nears 10.5k so you can break even.
Then, Dollar Cost Average every week with small amounts.  What this means is, that every week, you buy a small amount of Bitcoin, which is safer than buying it all at once, because you aren't buying it all at one price, so if it goes down a bit, it's alright, because the AVERAGE price you paid is going to be lower, too.
Best of luck, I'm fairly new to this myslef!

I don't think you have to verify with small amounts.  Back when I used coinbase, I didn't have to.. Don't quote me o that though.

Dollar Cost Averaged my position to an average price of 10200$/btc.  I have a few hundred bucks left to buy low.  I'm just gonna HODL and buy the rest of my position when I deem it to not go much lower.  Anyone think it'll be at 10k anytime in the next two weeks, even briefly?
@_date: 2018-03-10 18:48:34
Who thinks we'll see 10k briefly in the next 48 hours?
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:18:04
Is it recovering?  Should I wait before buying?
@_date: 2018-03-11 15:08:47
Which HIGH volume margin trading exchange without required verification for small amounts would you recommend?
@_date: 2018-03-09 16:25:02
Here we go again!
@_date: 2018-03-09 01:03:53
very bold and detailed prediction. we'll see.

Buy at 8600, think it’ll pump back to 9400+ this weekend for small EZ profit?
@_date: 2018-03-08 21:07:25
No, it is based on the amount as well.  That's why a single whale transaction makes the volume go up like crazy.
@_date: 2018-03-08 21:08:59
Seems to be rising a bit.  What are you guys going to do?  Buy now, or wait it out?  Are you expecting a larger dip?  Of course no one actually knows, just want to hear some input, I plan myself on buying a bit, just waiting on when..
@_date: 2018-03-08 21:06:37
Technically, yes, it can buy at 10500.  But in practice, it will most likely buy very close to your designated price, so long as the volume isn't too big.
