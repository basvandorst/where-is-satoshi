Since it was free i would say hold on to it for right now you have nothing to loss.I would say wait two weeks when the market settles down and go from there. Or you can do what i do and sell high on the markets and buy low. Ive more then doubled my bitcoins in the past few days. Plus its kind of fun learning how the market works so when it does go up again you'll know how to trade.

Blockchain is great for keeping your money online. But there has been cases of wallets being hacked but they wont be going after your .22 ;). Its been mostly huge accounts being hacked. Try no using google as much as possible. I wouldnt even suggest using internet explore,chrome or anything that is not compatible with the tor browser for security purposes. Never follow any wiki links either when looking up how-to's on btc they can send you to fraudulent phishing websites. If you are really concerned about being offline look into using a paper wallet. The only issue is if you lose it youre out of your btc forever. For now though i would either keep it in blockchain or keep it on a trading site like mtgox or btc-e

Under history to the right next to the transaction there is a green check mark when you hover of it, it says confirmed. The other thing i didnt mention was when i was attempting to transfer the bitcoins it gave the refreshing circle. That page never reload like previous times. Instead after about an hour i opened another page to check if it had just stalled. That's when i saw the green arrow under the transactions history. I just tried logging on again. They tried to block my ip again just right now. Ive been taking plenty of screenshot just in case they try to delete my btc-e account. I have no problem uploading photos if you guys would like to see them though. If you would like to check the chainblock blebled47 has submitted the address below. Hopefully someone can help :/

I would agree with you other than they responded almost immediately when i was just asking a simple questions.... but as soon as it came down to the bitcoins that were missing they didnt respond at all and just tried to block me? Doesnt make sense....

Thanks for the input everyone! Finally they fix it and my bitcoins are returned!!!!!! I appreciate everyones help and if anyone has a similar problem feel free to contact me and ill guide you in the right direction. Ultimately the only person that can fix the issue on the site is the admin dont bother with anyone else go straight to him. Emailing,skyping and messaging didnt work until today. So keep on it if you are in a similar situation.
