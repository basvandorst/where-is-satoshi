They will tell you.

If you have that much invested go get yourself a trezor (or 2), and a cryptosteel to go with it; the peace of mind will be well worth the cost.

Quite surprised their fees are so low really.
@_date: 2015-06-30 17:49:59
If you lose or smash your Trezor you are indeed out $170 Cdn, but your BTC are safe. If you own more BTC than the cost of the Trezor I highly recommend buying one.
@_date: 2015-12-04 01:24:42
So if I write a thing here

@_date: 2015-06-30 00:29:12
Whoa now! That's just too much logic all at once. Care to water that down and spoon feed it over time?
@_date: 2015-06-27 20:39:34
Just do it. Wait... If the BTC you own is worth more than the cost of a Trezor, buy one right now. If you plan on owning more BTC than the cost of the Trezor go get one eventually.
Pros: Very secure. I can use it on random computers that may or may not be spying on me, and have no worries that my accounts will be compromised. 
Small form factor, I carry mine with me everyday in my fob pocket (that weird little pocket typically on the right  side of your pants that isn't good for holding anything else...) and tend to forget that it is there, unless I pat check it before I leave the house.
Peace of mind, the Trezor allows multiple wallets each accessed with a different pass code, AFAIK you can have an infinite amount of accounts associated with a Trezor, each one standing independent of the others (ie: no way to tell that the BTC are associated with the same device or same person)
Cons: Uhhh I dunno. It's a pretty cool little piece of tech. It can get stolen? But even then It's useless to the person who stole it, they can't access anything inside. I've read reports of people accidentally washing them, but they still work after, so that's not a con...
I'm sure there is some reason why they are horrible, but I sure haven't figured that out yet. I wish I could justify buying another one TBH.

Here have an upvote for trying. I assume you are being downvoted for a slight error in your post. You cannot "get anything delivered in 2 days from amazon" unless you already have a credit card. If you don't you'd have to wait weeks for the bank to approve you, and more time after that to recieve your cc in the mail. If you already have a cc, then you can order as your post said, but then again, if you already had your btc you could spend those as well. You were comparing apples to oranges.  Hope that makes sense for you.

Bondholders have to be the most ignorant subset of any investors  almost anywhere. They are out there competing with people who own CD's, and invest in pyramid schemes. The amount of money made on bonds is nothing... you've only locked your money away for a set amount of time. In half of the cases of 'investing' in bonds an individual would literally be better off burying their money in their backyard, at least then they could access it whenever they wanted. Imagining people with such little knowledge of finances buying bitcoins is too far of a stretch for me.

Partly you are right, but Windows is written to be usable, after that, they patch it up for security. Linux is written for security first, then usability afterwards. If a patch makes the system more secure, but harder to use for the consumer, the patch is still implemented. Plus is there is a vulnerability in windows, you have to wait for a windows employee to care. If they don't, it never gets fixed (google zero-day exploit for some info on unfixed vulnerabilities, that will likely forever be ignored). Linux is different. If something is wrong, hotfixes are available immediately, even before official repositories make the change. Linux has security by security, make more secure by obscurity.

I'm all in on BTC, but very Thursday I like to act under the assumption that the Blockchain tech is a new form of CIA proprietary. Look at it this way: Create a new form of cash, create a ledger that records all transactions made with this new form of cash. Convince people to use this cash for buying and selling drugs and guns, (and Harry Potter, and the Holy Bible). Review records of transactions, use metadata to deanonymize the players involved, stage a massive raid and convince everyone that TOR was at fault, and that the blockchain had nothing to do with it...

I haven't been following the news in a minute, is this something new that you can link me to, or is it the same old story from before? In regards to BofA I own stock, and have followed the story off and on. The fines they're paying are for giving out loans to people whom they knew couldn't pay them back (not the same as stealing, just exploiting human greed, ie. those people shouldn't borrow money they can't pay back to begin with). And that wasn't even BofA, that was a bunch of smaller banks throughout the country that BofA bought after the collapse in 2006-08, but people felt that BofA should have forgiven all of those bad loans instead of repossessing peoples homes. Anyway, I still do business with BofA because they don't steal people's money (well... not in the way people think), that and I don't like them, and they pay me to do business with them. (anyway back to work, I'll fix this shitpost later)

Practical: Depends on how hard it is to get to the ATM. If it's close, that is awesome, and I envy you. 
If you keep it safe a paper wallet is a great way to store bitcoin, just put it in a safe or rent a safety deposit box from your bank. (usually less than $40 a year in the US)
I have no idea if it prints a new wallet as I have never used one.
The ATM should be secure, but the best way to be sure is to immediately transfer the BTC from the paper wallet they gave you (in case they or a man-in-the-middle attacker has your private keys) into an offline wallet you have created yourself . You could then either keep the keys on your offline computer or print them yourself and store those paper wallets in a safe.

In terms of investment, it's hard to recommend cryptocurrencies at all, but if I were going to make recommendation I would stick with BTC. Merchant adoption is through the roof, news in Argentina is vaguely interesting, what is supposed to be happening in Dominica next year is mind-blowing, the security of the network is unparalleled, and no other cryptocurrency I'm aware of offers anything new to the ecosystem. (and if you are looking at something that is losing value as days go by, like Doge for example, do not buy any and call it an investment.)

I'm all for personal responsibility. I would never accept those loans as they were, and  just don't feel bad for people who raked up tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt without properly thinking about how they were going to deal with the debt later in life. But again, it wasn't BofA or the other major banks who were overly guilty of giving out bad loans, it was the small banks that they bought to stop them from going under. Everyone sadly wants a free lunch,  and wanted their loans to be forgiven, but if they were how would that be fair to responsible people who didn't rack up needless debt? should we further a system that encourages the least productive members?

Yup. I think we've started to get to the point in society where people aren't as happy to pay for a product before they use it as they used to be. Do I want to pay 12 USD for a product I may not enjoy? Nope. Would I watch your documentary and donate when prompted at the end if I like your product? Absolutely. In fact if you do that, I may donate more than once, years after purchasing the original product on that one night when I gathered a new appreciation for what you had created. Start putting QR codes on your products and people I show your videos to have the opportunity to pay you for your service. As a linux user I don't HAVE to pay for my operating system or programs, and I never will pay for a program first, but if you create something that becomes useful to me I will likely pay you more for it than your asking price.

Today I'm a Bitcoin Libertarian, and this unregulated market does not benefit me personally, and the only reason I don't believe that Ghash has a responsibility to limit themselves is because it is very important for people, for users, to recognize when a monopoly might be being built, and go about the process of disbanding it ourselves. Personally I think that it would be in Ghash's best interest to limit themselves to 40% or 45% and cement themselves as 1 of only 2 possible pools of that size. If honest companies limit themselves, there is a good possibility that they will be driven out by less scrupulous businesses in the future, and all the while we'll be asking them to please disband.

If this were to take off what would stop them from doing exactly what banks did? Decide that the gold backing isn't really necessary once the currency can stand on it's own? The main idea behind this is to "make gold more acceptable as a form of currency by combining its appeal as a store of value and a much more efficient medium of exchange", this is just paper money 2.0, since the spender still doesn't have any gold, just a promise of gold.

I'm guessing that people saw that it was fully funded, and isn't in danger of failing. People who are on the fence no longer have the need to pledge their money just to see the device made, now they can wait for release, see the communities reaction, and possibly get version 2. Combine this with the fact that the stretch goals really are pointless to the BTC community and we have a seemingly unpopular campaign.
 I think the device will do very well personally, and funded it very soon after it was announced. I also think that not giving anyone large amounts of money before their product is released is a smart move, especially in the BTC-sphere, we've had too many businesses spring up just to disappear again with our bits.

If it were to be done I would assume it would be a covert agency, such as the CIA, who would do such a thing. We don't want newspaper articles popping up about the White House mining coins, so a covert agency is the best bet. If one of these agencies used tax dollars to build the most awesome, amazing mining rigs ever conceivable by man, I doubt they would want to disrupt bitcoin (for one, BTC is at it's core a record of every transaction made, it's not anonymous, it's pseudonymous, and if the gov't can track everyone on tor because a few people fucked up and left massive metadata trails, then the same can most likely be said of btc) when they could instead have a machine that is almost literally printing money for them.

Sadly I wish it were as simple as what you described, but it can't work like that. You could make a purchase with you credit card, receive your BTC, call you cc company and reverse the transaction.

As much as I agree with everything that you've said, I don't necessarily think that this is a bad thing (I'm talking about this kind of drama in general). Open projects, while they are strongly centralized in the people writing the code and proving funding,  ultimately are in the hands of the community.
Let's take Linux and Microsoft for example. The Linux community is a very dramatic and often childish place with developers and community leaders constantly calling each other out for coding or design decisions, and people correctly comment on how unappealing this is. These same arguments tend to go on behind closed doors in organizations like Microsoft (or the Federal Reserve), and while the decisions being made will ultimately affect the end user, we have no idea what has been decided, nor do we have any say in the process. In open projects we don't have to accept end-products, we have the opportunity to see things as they unfold and to an extent get our opinions heard (Hi Gavin! Hi Peter!). In the very end, if you're a miner, you get to decide if all of the developers work even goes into effect. Having said that, all of this is being recorded for posterity, so think before you make an ass out of yourself guys.

Well the original design had nothing to do with BTC, IIRC. I believe the company had been around awhile, gotten into BTC, and then decided to revamp their smart card as a Bitcoin product. The BTC community let them know that certain design decisions (the extent to which the card created metadata from your transactions for one) wasn't cool, and they've redesigned according to those, and other more realistic specs. That's not to say gen 2 or 3 won't have all the bells and whistles. If anyone can correct me or add to this, please do.

I think what he is getting at isn't that we shouldn't use btc, but that we shouldn't encourage the conception that it is or ever can be anonymous, by doing so people will use it to do things they want to be secret, and will in effect be displaaying those secrets to the world.

So one way to look at this is 56 mBTC, that gets rid of a few numbers. The closer 1 BTC is to $1000, the closer 1 mBTC is to $1. So if the price is just under $1000, then 56mBTC is ~$50.  The price can fluctuate quite a bit and you can still get a fairly accurate guess of the items price. (mBTC can be read as millibit or Milly).

If Gavin talking to the CIA against Satoshi's wishes had anything to do with Satoshi removing himself from the public eye, why should we trust BitcoinXT? Since the inception of btc when we think of an outsider attacking the network we always seem to focus on a 51% attack, and congratulate Satoshi on making this unprofitable; while what we see happening today would be a more realistic attack on the network, bypassing the code itself and attacking people's faith in the system. What's happening now may not rattle OUR faith in btc, but I can definitely see this driving away anyone with a mild interest in the network. I'm not saying Gavin is attacking the network, but this shows me one way that "those in power" could go about destroying btc from the inside. I am fully aware this is FUD against Gavin, and pretty tinfoil hatty, and without any really basis, but it has been on my mind for the last few days, and I wanted to read everyone's thoughts on the matter.

If you ever do anything illegal coinbase/circle et al will most likely freeze your account. 
If you aren't thorough with mycelium (ie make a safe backup from a safe phone) you can lose your own BTC.
So what it comes down to is your own use case and whether you trust yourself more than a licensed exchange.
Let me put it this way, I control all of my own coins, because I love computers and like learning about security.  I recommend that all of my friends stick with exchanges, because I know them, and I know how bad the average computer user is with something as simple as backups or  passwords.

Personally I would rather trust a stranger with only x amount of btc than give that person my credit card info and trust that they only use it once for the amount we agreed upon. I will never use my credit card on a personal site, but I use btc that way all of the time, it's much safer for those types of transactions.
@_date: 2017-04-07 19:57:48
People seem to ignore the fact that legacy systems are not actually instant either, just because you walk in and out of a store does not mean that the money transfer was instant, it typically takes 1-5 DAYS for the transfer of value. A 10 minute confirmation time doesn't mean you have to sit in a store for 10 minutes (tbh this may happen to you, but only because people are not used to btc yet) it means that the receiver has to wait 10 minutes before they can spend it themselves.

...or steal a credit card, use it in the store, and if they didn't ID you (which is standard)  they get nothing when the rightful owner reports the theft. It's a million times easier than double spending. I use local bitcoins to buy BTC and have never asked someone to wait for conf if they are in a hurry, and have never had any double spent. Granted now that CPFP is the norm, and BTC age doesn't mean shit this is closer and closer to being a realistic attack.

For best printing open the file with GIMP (or photoshop) and ignore page margins. We've done a bit of tweaking to get the images to line up and have had pretty good luck  on multiple printers (just not on the first try). If you can't get the images to line up I can get the artist to upload the back image without the borders. Oh yea, and if you had a few bits to spare, and no GIMP/photoshop skills of your own my friend said he could put your qr codes into the image for .05 BTC.

You could do that. You could also set a password on the Trezor, which acts as a 25th word. When you log into the Trezor it asks for a password, and no matter what you type it accepts that as correct and generates a new wallet. If you then have 7 different passwords, they lead to 7 different wallets. This would make it easier to store the passwords, but your use case is up to you.

If they got rid of the fingerprint scanner and wireless charger and could lower the price this would be a more viable wallet. they shouldn't store 1/3 of my keys or ask for my personal info either.

Well shit up to the front page.

For a simple into to Bitcoin go check out the Joe Rogan experience  where he first interviews Andreas Antonopolous. Joe is a little gruff and is a total bro dude but he's amazingly open-minded and surprisingly intelligent. He asks tons of questions and Andreas gives awesome answers.
If you are in the US use either Circle or Coinbase to buy your bitcoins (I use coinbase) just know that both companies want A LOT of personal info from you to protect their own asses. If that's not to your liking try local bitcoins or the local trader built into the Android Mycelium wallet,  you'll pay more than with Circle or Coinbase, have to deal with strangers and wads of cash, but you can preserve your anonymity.
 Its a large and confusing subject as everything you learn only leads to more questions, you'll either end up reading the Whitepaper (which I do recommend) and looking at code, or eventually realizing you don't need to know everything about the engine, you just need to know how to drive, fill up your tank and get from point a to point b. Hope that helps.

I'm not sure what they are actually doing yet either, but my thinking went like this; as a content creator your not really writing data in the blockchain per se, but using a Satoshi as a key for other content. Taking my other post into consideration they could end up creating something akin to iTunes where consumers buy directly from artists, and then by trading satoshis to other fans are actually trading their rights of (consumer) ownership with other music fans. This would create a system where only one person would 'own' a specific copy of a specific piece of digital media, but would be able to give it away or even resell it at a later date, effectively giving up the ability to play the song, read the article etc... to an extent they would be recreating the old system that we had with physical cds, books, what have you, but in a digital world.

I think this device could be useful for digital music. a musician takes a song or album, tags it to a Satoshi and sells it for xBTC, the transfer of the song is free, automatically included in 21inc's block, and can then be traded to someone else at a later date, also for free. Either I'm totally wrong, or this could actually be a really awesome innovation to create scarcity of digital goods without having to lock them to a persons account permanently. Imogene Heap (and others) have been trying to find a way to use the blockchain to share their music, and they may have just been beaten to the finish line.

Bitcoin is a neat... not even technology, just a neat way of doing things, and if it takes off people who own some would make a little money, and that is, of course exciting to think about; but is definitely a detractor to the more exciting things going on in the Bitcoin world.

If I remember correctly one could 'translate' that into english as "The information in a system is inversely proportional to the ability to accurately predict the outcome of that system".
Hopefully that's correct, because I like to look at life like that. If you know what tomorrow will bring, there is no more information. Shake it up.
Or I remembered it wrong, and you can carry on. Or I'm just delusional.

thanks for the review, sadly/thankfully I'm not in the market for another hardware wallet (trezor is still rockin my socks) but I may well end up getting a Gen. 2 down the line.
I would really like to see them produce a cheaper version without the wireless charger and fingerprint scanner though, for my spending bits a long pin is good enough.
One question, if the company were to dissapear would the wallet continue to work? They are paying for the 2g connection currently aren't they? Does that affect the longevity of this device?

What if BTC wasn't created by a benevolent Japanese man with with the future of humanity in mind? What if it wasn't even created by a gov't agency to monitor our every transaction through mountains of metadata. What if BTC was created by corporations? What if industry finally got tired of gov'ts being in control of money? Maybe they're tired of running off to tax shelters overseas (and then having those accounts shut down) and incurring fines for treating the working individual like trash, and they want to be in charge of the whole system? In my mind corporations and gov'ts have always been working hand in hand, but what if their agreements were only because gov't printed the money and had the armies? What happens when armies can be purchased (and they can) and our new corporate overlords have no invested interest in any particular nation?

This doesn't autogenerate addresses or anything fancy like that, but if you have a safe computer, gimp/photoshop skills, and your public/private key you can use these bills a friend of mine designed; they make awesome cold storage or a great gift.

Don't donate to that address on the bill, the artist has since lost the private keys cause not techy.

It sounds like you used someone's referral link to join CB, probably allowing them to get a dollar from CB in the process (it used to be $5), if you can find the specific referral link that you used (or ask them to look it up) then it may be in their best intest to ban that persons account. Sorry someone used you for their own gain, but it isn't really CB's fault, just some shitty person.

Anonymity is a heavy interest of mine, as are mental games. So let's figure out how your 'cash' bitcoins could be actually anonymous, it might help other people. Your 'cash' coins can't be bought with a CC, wire transfer, or anything of the sort. So maybe local bitcoins? If that's the service you use, you must have a second laptop, or live CD that is only used for this purpose. This laptop of course was purchased with cash, and has never been online at your home. Am I on the right track so far? Before we continue, please correct any mistakes I may have made, and clear up the process by which you have acheived anonymity, we all have alot to learn from eachother.

If you use the same computer to send bitcoins that you've used to send the above message, you are not anonymous. Just pointing that out, in case you haven't taken metadata into your calculations.

I found the buyer!
@_date: 2015-02-13 23:18:46
AFAIK the only people who have one so far are the devs themselves and 1 or 2 people who bought the beta model on Kickstarter. I'm supposed to be in the first round of shipments which keeps getting pushed back. They were going to be released Oct, but have had a few production issues along the way (cases coming from the factory a different size than ordered, chip manufacturers being unable to flash the device etc...), but seem to be working things out, and hopefully I'll be ranting and raving about it soon.
@_date: 2015-02-20 00:01:09
It depends on timeframe. I have no idea what BTC will be worth tomorrow, or a week from now, but there is enough information out there for me to assume that the price will fluctuate around $5-10 during the day. So for each BTC I buy and sell, I would be making 10-40 cents per trade, every couple minutes. 
If you're interested, go to  [coinbase  example exchange]( bring a pencil and a pad of paper, pick a price that looks high for the last 1/2 hour or so and "sell", mark the time, the price and the fact that it was a sale in your notepad. When the price looks a little better, buy it back. You'll find that selling lower than you want by several cents and buying higher than you want by several cents can increase the amount of trades per hour dramatically.
This isn't quite realistic, just because BTC hit a certain price doesn't mean YOUR coins were sold, but it's a decent enough idea. I've been doing this for awhile now, a little every day, and as soon as the exchange opens in my state I'm going to go out and make mistakes.

Everyone seems to think that we should be out in the streets evangelizing, and spreading the good ol' word of Bitcoin to the masses, which from a disruptive point of view makes sense. But I don't think the Winklevii are really in it for the disruption, I think they're in it or the money. And if they really think that BTC could be worth more than it is now, maybe it's in their best interest to keep their mouths shut, and acquire a greater market share while it's still cheap to do so..

Won't most legacy email systems auto reject your massages? Like Hotmail, gmail, yahoo etc... I was under the impression they would only accept messages from 'trusted third parties' and than running your own email client was fine in house, but that it was useless out in the 'real' world'.

I have two pin and password protected trezors, one in my home, one on the other coast. I use mycelium as a watch only wallet so if something bad happens I can kill myself now instead of waiting for a year like some rube. I have a cryptosteel as well to prevent the fire/water scenarios, and because I'm a dork and like my toys. I give paper wallets created with the mycelium entropy to loved ones as gifts (but only on special occasions, otherwise I covet it like that pirates booty.) If I didn't spend all my extra cash on btc I'd buy a few other techie toys to play with, but I thibk I'll  live for now.

I'm going to guess that IF you were banned for excessive tipping, you were probably banned for basically dusting everyone.

You're probably going to have to use localbitcoins or find an adult willing to create an account at circle or coinbase. Stop telling people WHY you want BTC, you're probably scaring people away as you are basically asking them to help you commit a crime, then there are people who don't care about law, but don't think anyone under 18 should be using drugs. Hell, find another reason YOU are interested in BTC, and don't use them illegally (unless you are very paranoid and smart you will be creating a digital trail between you and your DOC)

I think one of the most interesting use cases for Bitcoin is peer to peer transactions online. I've bought quite a few consumer goods being sold by individuals I'd never give credit card info to. Right now the average person needs to use a third party service and pay fees to accomplish this.

I backed the Entropy, I use Mycelium on Android, and have quite a bit or respect for what you have accomplished so far, and look forward to seeing what you create in the future (the Bitcoin Card!). Having said that, this video diminishes your credibility as a company. If I didn't *already* know who you were, this video would not entice me to learn more about you, and I honestly might walk away with the impression further implanted in my mind that BTC was 'drug money'.
I don't mean to be rude, because I truly do think your company is awesome, but you need to make commercials aimed at adults, this current approach is a little embarassing. Someone looking into your company online for the first time are going to be seeing this instead of a real portrayal of your products. Take your time in creating your next ad, there is no hurry, and there are many of us standing behind you guys already.
