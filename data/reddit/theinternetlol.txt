Coinbase has worked fine for me.  I've never bought from them, but I've withdrawn to my bank account without any issues,.

Maybe he bought them at $1000 and is a youngster

That's an interesting question, because there's the possibility that shares of the ETF can fluctuate in value independent of the Fiat value of BTC.  This will of course have the added benefit/negative of acting as an additional metric influencing BTC/Fiat prices.  Also, for people that aren't "tech savvy" but have pre-existing portfolios, it can make investing in BTC a bit more accessible.  As easy as wallets are to manage, that kind of thing is still beyond a lot of people.  There are plenty of people out there that actually think they won a free Ipad when they see a popup telling them so.
Ideally, I think it will help the price as BTC trading will be in a more familiar format for a lot of investors.  Unlike mutual funds, ETF shares can be actively traded the entire market day.  This will likely exponentially increase the trades done per day because as of right now, there are just a handful of exchanges on which BTC is traded.
It's when/if some of the mammoths like Goldman Sachs get involved that things will get really interesting, either for the better or otherwise.

Hi, and thanks for this!  Unfortunately you didn't format the command correctly.  It would be 10000 bits.  You need to have your reddit account linked to the change tip site and then your btc deposited in change tip before you can give it out in that manner.  Either way, thanks for remembering.

Simplest way would be to sell them to Coinbase

Well in that case, if you want to jump through a few hoops, you could sell them on Bitstamp.
