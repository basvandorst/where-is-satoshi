I am from Russia myself and have a lot in BTC-e. BTC-e registered in Cyprys and Bulgaria and won't be affected by this.
May be they won't be able to accept deposits with russian qiwi in future but i don't care.

I think that Chinese case is worse because China produces much more than USA and has a lot of goods to sell worlwide. Their goverment made really stupid step i believe.

India is the poorest country in the world
why anybody should even care about india? thats nonesense. they don't play any role in bitcoin adoption anyway.

or if you going to spend your bitcoins get out of China

Unfortunately merchants cannot accept BTC or show prices in BTC.
So people can only speculate with BTC in China. And Bobby tells that there is no another way.
Sounds not so good.

I hate it, because it's bad news now.
Bobby confirms that goods cannot be sold for BTC even via merchants.
In china you cannot play with the law we all know.
I am not going to sell my coins and advise to everybody to hold it.
