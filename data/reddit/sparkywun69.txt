my advice? incorporate to hold assets  and make yourself CEO.  Store EVERYTHING THERE.
Its it own legal entity.  She will have a nightmare of a time going after it (still possible) and as CEO you dictate your own salary (don't take one.)

Interesting! Thanks for the update!

Aside from normal life functions and the cost of dating.  All my other monies get invested (in stocks and funds and some into BTC).
I treat daytrading crypto like gambling and I was keep a reserve just incase I fuck up royally.
No vice life is where its at.  I'm pretty far ahead of my peers.

Its too bad.
In the new year those Monero cards would probably help you out alot.

so, just to clarify...
the BTC I just leave on the exchange (ex bittrex) will not be affected?
