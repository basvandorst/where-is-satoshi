this is the longest sideways movement I can remember.  We have stabilized for at least the last three weeks.  This descending wedge has to break soon, or am I missing something.  I know stabilization is great, which would mean that more influx of money would bring prices up.  This market has me scratching my head every day.

If this is a representation of the current fight against Fiat then I would say that Bitcoin and especially altcoins are getting destroyed by that bear. Regardless of past results this does not take away from its recent activity of being a good investment.  You can downvoted me yet it is still cringey.

I like it but it's cringey propaganda for a product that is 1/5 value it was a year ago.

Who are the biggest criminals in the world? Bankers.  It absolutely has value, because people put value on it. USD is a piece of paper backed by a private bank the "federal" reserve which has nothing to do with the government.  No one runs or owns Bitcoin. There is no Bitcoin office or CEO.  I'm not here for short term gains.  You're just contributing to the fud. Thanks

I said the same thing in the summer.  now its beyond ridiculous.  im easily down 2/3 my initial investment.  I feel horrible, but i am also in for the long haul.  buying more.  whats the worst that can happen? I'm already down 40k
@_date: 2018-11-25 13:04:34
Or maybe the boys are fud'ing out while the men are tripling down.  I don't see wealthy people chickening out. Only the fuckboys
@_date: 2019-01-08 00:44:01
And I'll buy even more at 1k

I'm very much in the green. It's a sale to me. If you got in last December then yeah I feel bad for people.  Dollar cost averaging is solid strategy that has nothing to do with betting on indexes.  I made tons on Xmas day when fools panicked.  
It's not like there's a run on the banks in France or anything /s

Remind me in a year who is the fool.  They said I was foolish 4 years ago too. I'm still laughing all the way to the bank

How is buying cheap Bitcoin at 1k comparative to Nick Leeson?

There will only be 21M btc ever. So at some point it will balance itself out.  There is also no btc manager or CEO.  Not sure where it's going but I'm not going anywhere
