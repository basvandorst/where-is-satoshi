Very nice website, great products, accepts btc, and free shipping! I found this a month back and ordered myself a sweet slider.
 Quality of glass is the best I've ever seen, and it was cheaper than the shit bowl I bought with my bong. Not exaggerating a bit.

Cryptolabs and butterfly labs both have prototypes posted on their websites...I own a trezor and I just bought it instead of waiting on one of these. After some research, I feel much more safe with my coins stored in a device with the smallest area of attack. (No biometric scans, cameras, WiFi, or microsd slot)

I think capitalism is caught in the crossfire here. I agree with so much of what you said that I'm probably just nitpicking at this point. 
I think bitcoin is our way out. State financial manipulation is at the root of many of society's problems today. However its worth mentioning that capitalism/free markets are the natural state of order between people. I like the goals of leftist mentality but they can not be achieved without a workable system of cooperation. Capitalism is that system when its not contorted to other ends.

The blockchain is a distributed peer to peer ledger of transactions. When anyone makes a transaction, that transaction is sent to thousands of computers to "upload" to the blockchain independently. Each computer that accepts the transaction adds it, along with the other transactions that occurred in that roughly 10-minute block, to a text file called the blockchain. No one person or business can deny your transaction unless 51% of the network denies it together. The value of a system that protects against double spending with no single point of failure or trust varies greatly from person to person, the result being a highly volatile infancy.

The value of the coins is actually in the blockchain. People see value in the security and reliability that it provides for transactions... You are right that the exact value is based on agreement between all of us, but you can apply the same logic to government backed fiat or even gold
