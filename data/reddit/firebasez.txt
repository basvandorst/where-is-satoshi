So you can open a payment channel, deposit funds, lock your funds away, deduct from them over time to reconcile them with the payment channel the seller also has to open using tab technology that isn't yet available, or... just increase the blocksize?

How successful are tabs?

At least they can just print more.

u/benevolentCheese and u/nOpe-nope, with **bitcoin** you can:   
      
* send your money directly to anyone anywhere in the world in minutes
* transact micro-payments
* access and use your money 24/7 
* avoid bank delays
* avoid bank fees
* avoid bank limits
* avoid financial middlemen
* avoid **[fractional reserve banking](
* avoid debasing (Venezuela, Zimbabwe...)
* optimize transactions
* save billions in inefficient third-party transaction fees and interference
* have more control over your money than banks or the FED
* bank the unbanked in lesser developed countries   
   
**Once,** for example, I bought a car in Mumbai. I had to transfer money from my U.S. bank to do this.  It took six weeks.  Six weeks.  And numerous international phone calls.  Why, when an ATM in India can tell you your bank balance in the U.S. in under 30 seconds?  If the Toyota dealer accepted bitcoin, we could have concluded that transaction in minutes. For a few dollars. Win-win.   
Here's a 2013 **[article]( worth a quick look. Then, bitcoin was $147. The article says bitcoin was in a bubble.   
**But** flip the question around and ask yourself, **"How are banks better than bitcoin?"** Banks offer security and insurance, for example, and some people are more comfortable having a bank or government act as a third party in the middle of a transaction instead of computer code. So you may still conclude that banks are better than bitcoin. Fair enough. Many do. But don't dismiss bitcoin without considering what it *does*.  Don't just look at its price. Look at it's *utility*. It's valuable because it's useful. And it's useful because it *does* things. **Better.**

Fiat is in the bubble. Not bitcoin. Short term correction, long term rise.

Many who call bitcoin a tulip-ponzi-scheme-delusional-bubble-child do so because they only look at bitcoin's price. They dismiss, or don't consider, it's utility. Bitcoin is *valuable* because it is *useful*. And it's useful because it *does* things. **Better.**

$10? I'd assess higher. But here's where I agree with you. Bitcoin isn't in a bubble just because it's price is high or it ascended quickly. It's in a bubble **IF** its *price* has disproportionately outpaced the value of its *utility*.  That's the heart of the debate, and what you highlight here. Has it?

Good point. I haven't researched it, but wonder how bitcoin's distribution compares to the U.S. dollar.

Where do the Holders get the coins from? The miners, verifying transactions and producing coins. How do the miners transact them? Through exchanges (merchants) to Holders.  How does all this tech work? The developers. Each group working together makes the collective ecosystem. If all Holders hold coin X, for example, but all miners mine coin Y, Holders can't buy, transact or move coin X and the chain freezes.

Because BCH transactions are faster and cheaper than BTC transactions.

Taking your factory analogy further... How often do we go to Amazon (or Exxon, Samsung, Apple...) to order something because it's the biggest, fastest, cheapest and easiest? Sure I'd like a gourmet burger today for lunch, but McDonalds is quick, cheap and dependable.  And who are our money factories?  We even use factories we don't want to - like Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America - because we have to - because better factories (cyrptocurrency) are still being built.

This is what the bitcoin cash community and myself believe  - bitcoin has more utility when used as **both** a medium of exchange and store of value. Given this, BCH strives to speed transactions and reduce fees.

* **I've had similar experiences.** I mention bitcoin in normal conversations whenever sensible. Recently, for example, I asked a U.S. government (USG) Financial Management Director if USG employees overseas could transfer money in bitcoin instead of checks. She'd never thought of this and barely knew what bitcoin was - as a financial director accountable for numerous international transactions for 8 hours a day 5 days a week. For her whole career.
* **Likewise,**  I recently mentioned bitcoin to another senior, well-read, well-traveled professional. He replied, "Bitcoin? I thought that was a scam?"
* **Try it. Mention it to some people.**
* But this is good. We're early adopters.  What happens when these mainstream folks enter crypto?
