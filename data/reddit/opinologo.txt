My impression is the person will want to save them first. Once you got them it will be easy to think about spending them eventually.  
Regarding a third person it wasn't mentioned as a possibility but I guess if such person is available he/she should be able to step in at any moment.

remember that Gox is based in Japan which is an independent country last time I checked.

You don't believe that wallets in Windows PC's are unsafe? Really?
@_date: 2014-01-13 21:39:38
Good news. Although the spread is huge! 70 USD.

what Mike Hearn (Lighthouse creator) says is that new Bitcoin features take too much time due to not many developers available and bounties not work very well to attract new talent, so this Bitcoin crowfunding app is meant to solve this issue.

Not necessarily, I think we are more than happy to exchange bitcoins for goods and services, which is becoming easier and easier with the current adoption trend. 
If the relative value between bitcoins and those good and services (valued in fiat) favor bitcoin, that's a only a positive situation.

nice video and very nice edition. Only detail sometimes the background music is too loud and wouldn't let me hear the interviews.

59:30 Gavin is questioned if he is Satoshi Nakamoto and he got immediately a red face (while denying)! Was he lying? 
@_date: 2014-04-06 01:00:23
Andreas is definitely in trouble now :)
@_date: 2014-04-14 11:39:26
I wonder if you also need to provide your id and hand if you are buying
@_date: 2014-08-02 04:54:59
with a url shortener you can spell it on the phone. Easy.

nice guy that Karpeles. I hope he goes in prison for many years.

and not having the option to print as much pesos as they want? I doubt it.
@_date: 2014-09-15 10:41:08
he makes a point in the presentation video (posted before in this sub) by showing how long other bitcoin developments took (around 12 ans 18 months) 
@_date: 2014-05-14 10:57:50


I know that this should be the case, but are you sure there is a linear relationship between amount of dollars and general inflation?
@_date: 2014-03-29 15:11:18
thanks OP

freedom / democracy / people's power. I wonder what is a better driver to convince.
@_date: 2014-10-24 23:50:28
Sorry but a bitcoin wallet in a windows PC is way outside my comfort zone.
@_date: 2014-03-29 15:12:47
from the story, you insert cash and got bitcoins, so no registration is needed. On the other hand you cannot get cash for bitcoins...

Very inspiring talk. A short version could be: We have two types of brains, the rational one, the neocortex, that understands facts but doesn't drive actions or decisions. Instead, our limbic brain is reponsible for our feelings but doesn't understand facts. When we need to convince about something is better to explain the why first (emotions and beliefs) then the how, then the what. Usually companies start from the what and that's why the fail, because they might convince your neocortex but that doesn't drive your decision. Examples include people without resources but driven by passion are the ones that convince others and ultimately succeed.

Email can be hacked, yes, but you still need the phrase and I don't think I can transmit a pk over the phone
@_date: 2014-03-24 13:27:15

@_date: 2014-07-06 13:44:27
And subways can also have transmission stations.

does anybody knows what is the exchange rate? I am wondering whether is better than coinjar...
@_date: 2014-06-11 10:12:20
I like "Bitcoin, the global currency" Global sounds better than international is direct and easy to understand.

With Coinbase you can pay with your Coinbase account (faster) or just send Bitcoins from your wallet to the address mentioned by the Coinbase merchant. 
I guess it should be the same for Bitpay and Bitstamp but can't confirm. 
@_date: 2013-12-22 01:22:36
any chance there is a youtube link of this match? :)
@_date: 2013-12-29 05:58:35
but maybe better than 50% for capital gains.
@_date: 2013-11-10 10:27:29
not that arbitrary as it is the biggest number that can easily be represented in any programming language by using regular float numbers.
