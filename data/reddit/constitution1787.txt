My possible Future:  Check bitcoin every 10 minutes, lose job because of it, liquidate everything to buy at ATH, expose fiat for the illusion it is, watch BTC crash and burn, move back in with parents, work as a barista for new fiat and, now here is the important part...realize that the love of family and the experience of this ride, good or bad, was beautiful.  No regrets either way. All in.

Fully agree - pay your taxes people!  Even if you don't like the system, you have to play in it for now.  Just HODL to the point where taxes are a negligible part of your portfolio.  It's a cost to do business.

Most people do not start investing at 18, so good on you for that.  Bitcoin is a volatile asset class with a hot track record.  Assess your risk and invest what you feel like.  Listen to yourself, always.  If you learn a few lessons, like losing half or all of it, well you have a long time to recover.  If it goes to the moon, well, awesome.  I've been through 300% gains on Matthew china funds, penny stocks and a bubble or two.  I will say that nothing has ever compared to the past few years in BTC.  Nothing.  Take that for what it is worth.
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:33:23
Also, invest as you learn with DCA.  Reward yourself for putting in the time to understand this unique asset class with incremental buys.  It will forge good behavior...or, go all the hell in and HODL.

If anyone is actually saying that, they want you to get your coins out so they can have some.  2013-2015 sucked for ppl in BTC, low gains, then it rose.  We are at a transition period but the back end will be stable and stronger.  HODL.  Seriously, don't panic sell.

While I can appreciate your enthusiasm for this subject personally, it is highly irrelevant and offensive to start a conversation like this.

Your investing strategy is flawed.  First, wait until I sell.  100% of the time, price spike to ATH within a week.  Next, when my FOMO kicks in, I'll buy back in.  This is your cue to sell.  Yep, price drop.  I have tried to game myself and buy and sell randomly, but the outcome is the same.  Do exactly the opposite of me.  ;)

Why?  I know the mantra is if you don't control your private keys, you don't control your coins.  But, 2FA is dependent on your phone, sim card, account security, etc.  All easily spoofed, cloned and compromised.  SO anyone with any amount of coins/tokens online, or accessed with 2FA is a potential target.  Millions of dollars are on exchanges.  I think what you meant to say is "not relevant to responsible cryptocurrency users" which I would agree in full.

BITTREX is up - to play the dips, you can convert BTC to USDT and put in a buy order for your price point drops.  WOuld only do this with a little % of BTC.  Oh, and if you see that the trading page is inactive - type in the trade page instead (  Works like a charm

I just read up on this potential.  It seems that him selling the coins or moving them would signify lack of faith by him in the technology.  I could go down the rabbit's hole on this one, but I think dumping the coins without some pre-conveyed intention would not occur IMO.

Yea, and mining roughly 80% (17/21 million) of the world's gold in comparison to Bitcoin would require a lot of energy too.  Most mining power is a one-time input.  What is more representative is the cost to mine per unit value of mined coin.  Bad math inbound: 8 years at 29,000 GWh (per Sol) divided by 17 million = .0136 GWh per coin (average). @ $.12/KWH = ~$120,000/GWh so about $1637/coin to mine.  Gold is about $1,000/oz to mine.

Had a nightmare that BTC and BCH were both at $3k.  Take this strategy for what it is worth if you want to trade but are new, nervous and susceptible to FUDL:
Under normal fluctuations, DCA about $50/week or whatever you can afford.  Under steep rises...HODL.  Under attacks or dips, this is where a good method can help curb emotional response.  
1. Use only when BTC drops $500 or more (assume a start point of $7,000 for this example)
2. For every $100 BTC drops, buy $100 (or some set level you decide on) down to $6,000
3. For every $100 more BTC drops, buy $200 (or some increased set level you decide on) down to $5,000
4. If BTC rises again by at least $500, go to step 1
5. New starting point and percentages based on what current prices are and your own threshold for investing.
6. DO NOT DEVIATE - if you believe in the technology and are in it for the long haul, be consistent.

A good assessment.  When Warren Buffet talks about bitcoin having no value I always think back to seaside communities trading sea shells, glass beads, etc.  What gave these value as a ledger was the consensus among the community.  Consensus is accelerating in Bitcoin and it has excellent ledger attributes.

We are in a 6-month or less lull in the gains of BTC.  People will play but it will stagnate.  After that, I expect a large swing up to at least 9k within 6-12 months, perhaps more.  This is the calm before the next storm.

Diamonds...more common than sand, but traded at a premium based on the best marketing campaign by a cartel in known human history, unreliable source transparency (blood diamonds, etc).
