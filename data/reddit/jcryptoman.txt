this guy bought before a dip and is freaking out, he probably sold at a loss then became angry and swear at random people; so another one behaving like an idiot, he is not the first and won't be the last!

no, this one is different. max supply is 10.1m and max block size is 3mb every 5min and there are no wallets or exchanges listed that support it. the other link looks to be more comprehensive...

you can see on the youtube video there is no logo on the case in the demo.

The fork to increase block size already happened in August, right?

BCH seems safer for now with much more upside than BTC at this level, just my opinion, but bear in mind the segwit drama will make BTC volatile until a winner is made.

No worries, they are London based (you can visit their office with an appointment) and use a foreign bank for cash deposits (UK banks are not very open to hold cash for bitcoin exchanges) and use cold storage for the coins.

Coinfloor has BCH/BCC BTC with **no trading fee** so good for you if you want to trade it rather than buy and hold for long term. The liquidity on the exchange is better for BTC than BCH/BCC but overall you get a decent volume.

Just look up "social investment", it's sometimes more attractive than mainstream investment and you can get tax relief.
