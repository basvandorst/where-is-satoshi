Stop parroting that bullshit. I can afford it but I just don't like losing money because GDAX decides they can fuck their customers over repeatedly with no consequences. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:33:36


You could easily prove me wrong if you were right about any of this but you realized you're entire argument here has been proving you wrong so now it's don't feed the troll. Mm hmm. That's what I thought. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:46:54
That's not a point. It could exit scam at any time. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:43:51
I was kidding. I thought the guy was joking around asking that question. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:39:59


Again saying stuff you don't even understand.. You just fucking bought in and you have no idea what you're even saying. Please explain. I'd love to hear this. 


A lot of words that didn't actually say anything. The above quote means NOTHING.

God bless moms for their funny and sigh-inducing ignorance sometimes. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:16:25
I already did argue the point. You just bought your first crypto and now you think you're some kind of expert just like everyone else in this sub who just bought in, so you go around and give awful advice like you know anything about anything. I'm tired of this shit. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:14:37
Still waiting on that explanation that you said I should read up on! Or will you just admit you have no idea what you're talking about. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:57:41
So how low do you think it's going to go on this South Korea banning bitcoin FUD?
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:36:22
Okay, now I know this whole thread is a joke. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:31:18
All of the people in the world who called bitcoin a bubble are funded by traditional investors? Do you believe everything that comes out of your mouth? 
I'm invested in bitcoin and it's CLEARLY a bubble. You'd have to be a knob to think otherwise. The entire crypto marketcap is. How many times have you even used bitcoin? For a coin with zero use do YOU think it is worth $14,000 a coin? Think about it. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:23:45
Coinbase and GDAX may go down sometimes but ALL of your money and your coins are fully insured there. Can you say that about any of these other shit exchanges? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:49:27
Yeah give advice to use exchanges in Ukraine with only 10 employees that could exit scam at any time. Awesome advise.

How the fuck is this rally still going? Does bitcoin not dip anymore? 
This is just getting retarded now. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:23:06
I know all that. Can't you see that you're completely proving my point about the big exchanges? How thick are you? You mentioning cold wallet MEANS NOTHING because every single cent you store on Coinbase is a hot wallet. You're only reading how Coinbase themselves stores the coins which doesn't matter to you or anyone else except their security team. 
Show me any of the small exchanges that insures even 1 cent of the money you have on there. YOU CAN'T.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:41:40
This whole leaving your btc address is so lame. Like internet pan handling. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:01:12
Me too. So do we get paid by GDAX now for missing all the trade I would've done? When is this fucking issue supposed to be resolved. This is fucked. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:22:51
You said the big exchanges are less reliable than the smaller ones. That's patently false. The smaller exchanges can and do close down and take everyone's money. Not to mention that the bigger ones are regulated and some have insurance for you on the money and coins you have in there. That's just ignorant advice you gave. That's all. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:47:08


There you go again with spelling errors I wouldn't have made in 3rd grade. Holy shit. This is why so many people think the cryptocurrency space in inhabited by a bunch of retards. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:36:19
Bigotry? Do you even know what that means? It's a fact that bitstamp is way more shady than the major exchanges. And learn how to spell. Jesus christ are you middle school or something? 
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:24:16
Every media source in the US has been calling this a bubble, because it is. Haven't you watched the news? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:22:46
You must've sent to the wrong address. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:13:49
Yeah.. this is the maturity we're dealing with here who are giving out advice. I hope bitstamp takes all your money and runs.

Oh, so you can use it to buy drugs online so its value of $14,000 is right on point? Are you serious right now? You have to be joking.
Not to mention that there are plenty of other coins that can do the same thing much better than bitcoin. Are they worth $14,000 too now? 
@_date: 2017-08-06 01:58:39
This guy is such a douche. I wonder how he's fairing now that BCH is circling the drain.

Just go to the places where free speech and expression is stifled the most. I know you probably think kotakuinaction is some kind of hate sub but this is just another one of those things you're wrong about. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:59:03
Ah, so this Wednesday. Interesting. So the price will probably fly upwards after the transaction fees go down and speeds go up, right? 
@_date: 2017-08-05 16:54:00
When you buy with ACH (assuming through coinbase) the price you paid initially is the price you got it for, so you are along for the ride if you bought with ACH.
@_date: 2017-08-05 18:10:21
Well, I have fiat too and have nothing but good things to say about the FED and the greenback. If you change your mind and want to open your mind to the real world of non-SJW bullshit then let me know and I'll welcome you with open arms.
Have a nice weekend. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 02:06:55


When is this happening and where can I keep up with this? 
@_date: 2017-08-05 20:06:13
It's a long and complicated story but basically there was a brutal civil war in the bitcoin community that went on for a long time leading up till August 1st when bitcoin split in two. The idea was to let the market decide which one would be the real bitcoin as people would vote with their dollar and sell the one they didn't want. The true bitcoin established dominance over the forked bitcoin, which is called "bitcoin cash," and once this was clear the crypto market regained much of the market cap that it lost during the weeks up to the August 1st split as fiat was rushed back in from the sidelines. 
It rose quickly in the last few days so I'm expecting some kind of pullback but it shouldn't be too drastic as it was hovering around $2,800 before August 1st and a major upgrade is set in place next week to make transactions with bitcoin quicker and cheaper. You know the saying, buy the rumor sell the news. If it keeps rising before implementation of the upgrade then it will probably drop as people realize it's overbought in anticipation for that and people going full FOMO (fear of missing out). 
@_date: 2017-08-05 16:52:45
The price you paid when you bought it is the price you get when the ACH goes through. You're good. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 00:18:07
I think you need to be 18. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 16:57:49
Put half in bitcoin and half in ethereum, both available on Coinbase. You can thank me later. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 16:41:28


Do you have any proof of this? I've heard that large funds are waiting for a big pullback so it wouldn't make sense that they would all of a sudden FOMO yesterday. These large funds are very systematic with their entry points. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 19:31:37
;)   Okay well we're not enemies. Sorry for my harsh words earlier. I was bit of an asshole quite unprovoked. 
I hope you have a good weekend. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 16:45:45
google it. It's a video. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 16:34:47
You can always afford part of one, say 0.1. And perhaps you can buy more later. 
You also have the option to buy ethereum, which also has much room to go higher and is a lot cheaper. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 17:10:19
I use both Gemini and Coinbase. Both are US based. In my opinion Gemini is the best as it's more stable and has less fees. It's a bit more difficult to get confirmed to buy there though as the are fully regulated in the same manner as a bank, so it can take a week or 2. 
Make sure to pick up some ethereum (ETH) too. The price is cheap compared to bitcoin and has the possibility for huge growth soon. Ethereum is available on both Coinbase and Gemini. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 18:00:25
Well they have different exchange markets going on. Neither coinbase or gemini make the price at all - the market does. They tend to follow each other but not exactly. For instance there could be a breakout on gemini where many people buy on that website at once, so the price increases there, and it could take a little bit for crypto people as whole to realize what's happened and that will cause people to rush to coinbase to buy, thus sending the price up there and so on. This happens throughout all the exchanges and when you look up a price from a non-exchange you'll see the average of all the different markets selling. On gemini you'll see all the people bidding, etc. With coinbase you can go to GDAX.com and see the same thing. GDAX is the exchange market connected to coinbase so you can use your coinbase login info. 
Join us in r/ethtrader and get addicted like the rest of us.
@_date: 2017-08-05 20:17:37
Ohh, okay. Yeah I've only done that once because it took a good while. 
On Gemini I receive my wire transfers within hours. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 17:32:49
No problem! Now you can go back to spending your time bitching and whining about Trump all day. Have fun!
@_date: 2017-08-05 16:38:38
Buy some ethereum too. it's cheap and will go much higher. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 17:42:22
It will surely go down hard many times in the future but you'll be waiting a long time if you expect it to implode. Now go back to your safe space. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 16:37:09
Is that in November? Is the market expected to go crazy like it did for BCH? 
@_date: 2017-08-05 16:56:15
One of the best methods is burning the information to a CD or DVD. Those things are way more stable than flash drives and they're cheap so you can burn many copies of the disks for a few cents.

@_date: 2018-03-01 04:11:31
But muh bitcoin is like so totes worth 11k! Undervalued! Just like when I sold near 20k and people called me dumb when I was calling it a speculative bubble about to burst. 
It is completely 100% speculation. But muh lightning network! And let's be clear, the bubble still hasn't burst yet even if it dropped a lot since 20k. I'll ride the wave but this house of cards can only go on for so long. I prefer to be realistic instead of countless people in this space who put on bulltard rose-colored glasses. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:42:49
 Oh ok, I retract that then. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:32:27
Then inject positivity. I won't stop you. But what you're suggesting is very far stretched so as to feel like you're injecting so much positivity that it feels forced. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:02:30
I'm just saying if it came down to it people will be able to buy no matter what. There isn't going to be a time when people are going to want to buy but not be able to. And *if* that time came the price certainly wouldn't rise because there would be no buying which is necessary for the price to rise to begin with. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:24:55
Except that's not true? Don't be a dumbass. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:55:14
Ding ding ding. 
The "buy the fucking dip" people are repeatedly saying that because they don't want the price to fall lower. It's that simple. If they felt so strongly about it then wouldn't feel the need to publicly make fun of others for not buying the dip. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:38:21
I remember you guys saying that when it dipped for cheap 17k bitcoin. I guess any bitcoin is cheap as long as it's in a dip? 
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:10:56
I think we're going lower and have been spot on so far. But opinions are like assholes. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:33:44
Not to mention we aren't paid an average yearly salary of $500 anymore.

@_date: 2018-02-28 22:59:47
Looks like the market is finally getting privy to the fact that bitcoin can only rise on massive buys and subsequent fomos. Bitcoin's inability to rise organically suggests extreme desperation and manipulation which does not bode well for bitcoin at all.

So you're taking out loans to buy bitcoin? *sigh*
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:07:09
I would assume so as well. I'm just pointing out that a lot of these super bullish comments are from brand new accounts. Very fishy. They could all be coming from one person for all we know. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:32:39
I'm saying that the probability goes up considerably that these bullish accounts are fake created by 1 or 2 people attempting to manipulate the market. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:26:59


@_date: 2018-02-13 06:31:22
'Cause we are. The tether situation hasn't gone away like a dark cloud in the distance.
@_date: 2018-03-01 04:06:49
How predictable a response is that. See, this is is how I know bitcoin is full of mindless idiots. I've made out quite well on the backs of idiots like yourself. Keep it up. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 23:19:50
Just look at the charts. See the rises through long green candles based on huge buys to convince the masses of window licking bitcoin investors to believe a bull market is in effect. Then they look at their shitty TA and see that they've broken out of this or that downtrend and that the rocket ship is loading up. You can literally fool bitcoin investors 100% of the time. They're the only group of people that are totally unable to learn and when more and more institutional (read: smart) investors come into this space they're going to eat everyone's lunch.
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:31:25
Older accounts have a much higher probability of being real as opposed to new accounts that could all be created by one person.
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:11:46
It depends on the tether situation, which may not be known for awhile. If tether is insolvent then we will go WAY lower than here. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:23:20
You needed bitcoin to buy an item? Hmm. Why does it make me think you're buying drugs? You know LE is tracking bitcoin purchases all the way back to 2011 so I'd rethink that. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:27:44
@_date: 2018-03-04 00:59:08
I just made a coin where only 10 million will ever exist, -ever. I guess that means the price of my coin should be more than double bitcoin's!
@_date: 2018-02-13 06:27:09
You think FOMO kicking in will be a good thing for bitcoin? See this is why people make fun of bitcoin investors. They just don't get it. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 04:53:08
If that happened you would owe me 1000 dollars. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 01:08:22
Yeah, many in this space talk about how evil fiat and regular financial institutions are and clearly they just don't get it. Many are straight up crazy like 9/11 truthers. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:31:23
These people don't have any clue what economics is or how it works. durr hurr, USD is a shitcoin! Inflation! Illuminati! NWO! Keep drinking the kool-aid, sheeple! 
Makes me embarrassed to also be invested in crypto considering all the morons in this space. It's mind-numbing. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:35:47
Yeah, it's all speculation at this point in comparison to buying something like AAPL which actually has numbers you can go over to figure out how much it's worth. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 21:24:04
You don't think it will succeed? How do you mean?
Does this mean you're not invested in btc if you assume it will likely fall hard after not succeeding? 
@_date: 2017-07-18 00:43:21
Yes, this is a trap.
@_date: 2017-07-12 22:50:03
But what I guess I'm really wondering is when this uncertainty will be over. I know nobody can really answer this but is there any chance that everything will be normal when Segwit is enacted or do we still have to worry about a potential 2x enaction or potential activation problems in late August or early Sept for Segwit, etc. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 21:21:04
There's a good chance we're in a bear market still due to the this uncertainty. I'm waiting. The green of today is a FOMO beartrap. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 21:41:32
Do you consider this a good thing? I'm confused on whether segwit or segwit2x will be better. 
If miners agree to segwit today does that mean segwit2x is still on the table for august 1st?
@_date: 2017-07-12 21:18:42
If Segwit gets activated early would that mean that there's no more uncertainty for August?
@_date: 2017-07-12 23:04:55
And that can theoretically happen at any time it gets to 51%? Wouldn't there be uncertainty before it actually gets activated in late August?
