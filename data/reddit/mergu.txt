Sad to see people misguided by the BCH cult, there's no convincing you all. BCH hard forked off the Bitcoin chain, introducing a new blocksize limit and creating its own new chain incompatible with Bitcoin. Segregated Witness was a soft fork. These are verifiable facts.

Rootstock, Liquid

In three years we'll definitely see widespread Segwit adoption, Lightning Network, Rootstock, Liquid, and many other new technologies added to Bitcoin. Although I enjoy upwards price movement, I'm even more excited about this.
Very likely in my personal opinion.

Yep, things are looking great for Bitcoin. Welcome back to the community~

It's not true, hence the revision.

I'm glad this is a place that's free of all altcoin / troll / shill nonsense.

The price is irrelevant, Bitcoin will continue to be improved and strengthened with every commit. Focus on the tech, this isn't a get-rich-quick scheme. 
@_date: 2018-06-05 11:17:21
You've been misled. Bitcoin Core is a software implementation of Bitcoin, the same as Bitcoin ABC is an implementation of Bcash. Bitcoin sees over 200k transactions a day, while bcash struggles to break 20k

Sad to see people in the space for so long buying into these tinfoil hat conspiracy theories. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 07:01:33
I understand people are upset about bitcoin.org not listing Coinbase and Bitpay. I don't understand how this is related to Core devs as you mentioned earlier.

Optimistic guess - Between 0 and infinity
Pessimistic guess - Between 0 and infinity
Let's focus on the tech and not the price.

 Bitcoin Core? How can I use a software implementation of Bitcoin to make payments? O.o
@_date: 2018-02-14 18:43:27
Even if 60% of the network went with Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin would still be Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash would still be Bitcoin Cash. There wasn't a 'split', Bitcoin Cash forked off of the Bitcoin chain. Imagine taking an exit off the interstate, if that helps.
@_date: 2018-03-16 00:34:43
Unfortunately I don't
@_date: 2018-03-12 11:45:49
That exact 'confusion' you experience stems from a malicious attempt to steal the Bitcoin name by folks in the other sub. Bitcoin is, and will always be, Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 20:01:31
Keep in mind 2nd layer scaling solutions can make sub-satoshi payments.

LN is a disruptive technology. It will become more user-friendly over time.

It's perfectly easy to explain to friends. Ver is deliberately misleading people who think they're purchasing Bitcoin.
