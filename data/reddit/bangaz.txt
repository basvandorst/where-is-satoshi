Nope not yet. I do plan to try some of them as my partner and I do a lot of sales of websites and hosting in XBT. Bitpay may just meet our needs in that!

Do you have to meetup with them? Nope.
But I was just starting out and was using it for cash trades in person. Only ever did $100-$200 at a time. This was before I could get a business bank account. 
For most other payment methods you could just use one of the other big services that is much cheaper. The only real advantage to localbitcoin is the meetup cash option

Haven't tried mintpal, may need to give it a try instead of just keeping with Cryptsy with small coins.

Hmm I'd rather not use BTER. Chinese company with no real info on who the company is. No proof of solvency. Lots of people claim BTER has stolen their coins (do a google search) not really worth it.
Agreed Cryptsy can have slow withdraws but I've gotten them all at least :P

It really depends on price that your bank charge to accept those wires. I've heard fees from $5 to $100. At $5 an exchange can function at $100 no one would use it.
I have heard some exchanges say 'oh well we only want big volume traders' but without lots of small volume traders you would not have anyone for them to trade with.
So bankwire is ok depending on price. What currency pairs will you have? What type of support team?

Can you imagine if Google creates a wallet service for XBT or even includes it in Google Wallet as functional payment?

They should look at what VoS did. They built a method based on the Bitcoin standard with work from the Bitcoin core devs. That's the best way to do it. Although even one of the audits would be better than nothing.

Happy to try other exchanges if it has payment methods I can use. Good luck.

You say you support BTC but act like an old world bank. Hidden fees all you want is fat checks!
What do we want to see from you? Nothing. I'd rather go with Quadrigacx or VoS. Quadrigacx is cheap and VoS are good people we can trust.

Ah that's pretty damn awesome! I imagine you still need a credit card at the hotel though to pay in case of damages?

Thanks Adam you and the team do such good work and it is great to see you replying here!

Not familiar with it. Is it an exchange?
