Much to the opposite of what people think, online retail companies will probably be driving the price down for a while as bitcoins will constantly be spilled onto the market at a faster rate than people are looking to buy.

What theymos said below... as I understand it your bitcoin address is a hash of your public key. So just knowing everyone's addresses isn't good enough to just through quantum computing power at. The public key for an address you might target is apparently revealed in a transaction when a bitcoin is sent from the address. 
So theoretically I guess if I have 1000 bitcoin in an address and I've spent bitcoin from it in the past (so it has outputs and not just inputs), the public key will be made public already in the blockchain in the past somewhere and the attacked could figure out my private key from it? Whereas if I have 1000 bitcoin in an address that hasn't produced a transaction output yet, my public key has yet to be revealed to the world?
Hopefully I can get an answer from someone on that last paragraph.

Yep. And this reflects the other point people have been making that we won't see the 'true' positive reflection in price from today's Senate hearings until a week from now...after everyone watching has waited the awful 5-7 days it takes to upload money into a bitcoin exchange.
Until it takes a person 5 minutes to set up an account/wallet and transfer wealth, the vertical slope will wait in the shadows. Which is a great thing for those still feeling like they missed out on buying bitcoins cheap.

I read this article too. The headline makes it out to be like a huge waste of money or something but the author later states in the article that the miners are still making a return despite the cited cost of power consumption. So...move along folks? It seems like the author thought did the calculations before anyone else so they thought that it was reason enough to write up something on it even though it's essentially irrelevant.

A key thing to remember in all these bitcoin attack scenarios is that as soon as someone well invested (time, resources, and money) in bitcoin disrupts bitcoin in a way that removes all the public's trust in it, it immediately devalues bitcoin immensely, rendering the attacker's bitcoin wealth worthless.
It's sort of a self-perpetuating system and I don't see anyone spending that extreme amount of time and effort to do something on this scale unless they are a pure 100% anarchist. Even then, what's the most someone's done out of pure anarchy? How much effort did it take?

Well, we saw excellent growth this past week and this news (I believe) will garner trust from potential buyers around the world, causing more exponential growth. How long it will last, I'm not sure, but I believe this coming week will see excellent growth as many more people will want to get in after hearing the US government's positive response.
@_date: 2013-12-20 07:28:52
Absolutely not, in my opinion. 
Those guys and girls running it are smarter than you think and they are doing an incredible service to the bitcoin world. They discuss the main hot topics from the past week, some more of the under-the-radar type issues, technical aspects of the bitcoin protocol, future solutions to problems we see today, and they also bring on a whole array of guests, from CEOs of bitcoin start-ups to creators of coins (Mastercoin, Protoshares, etc.) and they also include talks from various conferences happening all over the world.
They provide the best bang-for-your-buck bitcoin news and they come at you twice a week with shows. It is certainly clear (to me at least) they put in a ton of effort into each recording, so if they are just "pumping" bitcoin they are doing it with a ton of work ethic and complex and interesting analytical discussions.

This is a very informative video. Notably, I think it's fascinating that the "private" part of Facebook and Twitter's growth will be the inherently "public" version of Bitcoin's growth. All the world will be able to see what once went on behind the scenes. A learning lesson for all in that the volatility in the early stages will benefit those that took the time to understand bitcoin and its unbelievably value long-term and it will hurt most of those with poor knowledge or looking to make a quick buck.

Ahhhhh, thank you. I'm so sorry, I definitely sounded like a noob. 
Earlier this week I was using Bitinstant through blockchain.info, which worked wonderfully fast and I have no problems. If I ask this same question regarding how the Blockchain.info/Bitinstant/ZipZap method works, what would be the answer?

@_date: 2013-04-13 22:03:50
You can try localbitcoins.com. I haven't tried it yet, but it allows you to meet up with people who live nearby you and are selling their bitcoins. You bring your cash and you have them transfer the bitcoins to your wallet (that you can make for free and quickly on websites like blockchain.info/wallet) right in front of you (through their smartphone, for example). Once you see the transaction goes through, you give them the cash. No third party to nickel and dime you!
If nobody is selling a lot of 200-250 bitcoins you can just try and scoop up bitcoins from a few people until it adds up to the amount you want. 
Also, it's probably good to take the same precautions as someone would on craigslist and meet somewhere public!

One question I have pertaining to multisig wallets is if a wallet has 11 private keys, does it need 10 signatures? Or can it be programmed to have just 6? This would be useful for "majority vote" decisions in the league that would require there to be 3-4 bad owners as opposed to only 1 to mess up the payouts.

It's a psychological hurdle that will be overcome by research and experience.
Personally, I've found the more I read about bitcoin the more confident I am with my decisions. And the more I make decisions the more confident I become still. It's a reinforcement loop that rewards the early adopters the most. 
Those who are the least confident and adopt bitcoin 5-10 years from now will have the intuitive interfaces built for them already as replacements to the confidence they could have obtained by researching or experiencing earlier.

Many of your arguments are valid, but just know that most of them are typical for a "startup" technology. If Bitcoin truly has potential, many of the "integration into society" problems it still faces will be fixed and Bitcoin will become just that for the average consumer to use on a daily basis. 
What gives me hope is that Bitcoin is already attracting the the engineers, the programmers, the critical thinkers, the entrepreneurs, etc. to help solve the integration problem. You may only see and hear about some of their work a little bit now, but I believe there are still MANY at work behind the scenes working on the Bitcoin platform that haven't exposed their work to the public yet.
Bitcoin is a completely new monetary platform that is still in its "laboratory" phase. We have yet to reach the "clinical trials" yet, but I'm confident that that time will come because brilliant, forward-thinking minds are dedicating themselves to it. I believe Bitcoin rewards those who take the time to research it, invest in it, and innovate with it in its early days.

1. Create wallet on blockchain.info.
2. Once you have wallet, click "Buy with cash" button.
3. Enter amount of cash you want to use and click next or whatever
4. Get redirected to ZipZap page where they create a payment slip for you with a unique account number and the cash amount you entered. Find on the provided map a store location nearest you that has a Moneygram station (there's another service too but the closest one to me is a Moneygram station).
5. Bring payment slip and exact cash amount to Moneygram station at the store, pick up the red Moneygram phone, and be prompted through steps where you enter you information, account number, and another code referencing the ZipZap company that is crediting you with the bitcoins. The payment slip has these instructions on it too.
6. At the end of phone "call", you will be instructed to give the money to the clerk behind the counter at the store. Confirm amount and your name and voila! You should be getting an email within 15 minutes confirming the bitcoins placed into your wallet.

I've used this method all 4 times I've bought bitcoin using cash and I've never had a poor experience. In fact for me their service has IMPROVED over time. Before the $236 crash I would receive the confirmation email by the time I got home from CVS (~12 minutes). Just today I did my 4th purchase and I got my confirmation email BY THE TIME I GOT IN MY CAR TO LEAVE. Seriously, like 30 seconds tops. 
As long as you follow the steps and don't enter in anything incorrectly, you will have a good experience. 
More bluntly: If you aren't a stupid person, you will be fine.

I just tried putting money through BitInstant into my Blockchain wallet ealier today which was, as I found out when I got home, right as the Mt.Gox hold began. I have yet to receive the funds. Is this likely because they somehow rely on Mt.Gox?
I've done service with them the past few days without any issues at ALL (my wallet was funded by the time I got home). I trust it will be there, but I'm wondering if I shouldn't be expecting it until after 10pm?
And also, what exchange rate would likely be honored? If it opens at 10pm and I finally receive the transaction and say BTCs are at $50 per, will that be the rate that's honored or will it be the $120 rate that existed at the time I deposited the cash?

Same here. I bought $200 and $300 yesterday and today, respectively. The drive to the Moneygram station at my local CVS is about a 12 minute drive. By the time I've pulled in to my driveway coming home I've already received emails confirming the transaction and telling me I have had my wallet credited. 
It's great service if you know what you are doing (which isn't that hard, these were my first purchases ever!)
@_date: 2013-04-13 22:19:24
Ah, sorry about that!
Outside of mining, I think any service that allows you to exchange USD for bitcoins is going to charge some type of fee otherwise the service isn't making money (obviously). But once you're "in" and you have your bitcoins, you can send them around willy nilly without any fees at all (or nearly negligle fees, I believe). 
For the cheapest way, try finding some service with a flat transaction fee rather than a proportional transaction fee, especially with the high amount you are looking to buy. It could be the difference between paying $3 and $300!

While possibly dangerous, the altcoin "game" need to be played out because they act as real, ongoing experiments as to what works and what doesn't work as a cryptocurrency. Perhaps some type of attribute in an altcoin turns out to be unexpectedly useful! Or perhaps most altcoins will fizzle and die like some predict because they thrive on hype without a foundation.
If anything, the market testing out and investing in different cryptocurrencies helps the landscape EVOLVE. Scamcoins will fail and take down everyone with them. Coins that fill a little niche or provide some innovative twist (beyond just "knob turning" of blockchain parameters) will most likely succeed in some way or at least provide the more popular altcoins with new improvement protocols to add.
People might lose money investing in potato chip coins, but they will learn from this. It hardens the community and it provides incentive for someone to try something new and exciting in an altcoin because people will try it out as a real-life experiment. That coin might ultimately fail too, but even a fail is a positive for cryptocurrency as a whole because it brings the theoretical to the tangible by showing us what WON'T work, not just what WILL.
