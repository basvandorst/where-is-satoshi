Oh my god... Did you read the captions on the pictures? That entire page is more fabricated than IDK what.

LMFAO! Not a cult. Not a cult. Not a cult.
The fact that you think people are being paid to make fun of bitcoin is hilarious all in itself. To the moon!

Meanwhile, in Italy, 30% of the population is not connected to the internet.

Mate, are you kidding me? Goldman Sachs, the banking giant, has a lot of negative things reported on its wiki page. That doesn't stop the company from completing $1+ trillion worth of mergers and acquisition deals, does not stop them from operating their $1 trillion asset management division... It does not stop Goldman Sachs from being extremely successful. And you're complaining about bitcoin having bad publicity? 
All of these major banking organizations have relatively shitty Wikipedia pages. These companies are all still extremely successful, though.

Awwwwwwwwww. Want to downvote all of my posts to? Go ahead, baby. Just keep telling yourself that it is not a cult... not a cult...

Paid shills to undermine a "currency" that can easily be destroyed!

K. 
But that wouldn't apply to Ross.

Don't make such a shitty cover.

Totally just a few years away from mass adoption! Totally!

5 weeks? It took them 3 days for me. And that's because I was being slow and had many things to do.

You said it. Defrauding someone is illegal.


*Citation needed* on the "hundreds of billions" claim. Also, HSBC is not a person. They also did not escape without punishment. They were fined $1.9 billion. Not much, but enough to hurt its U.S. operations.


Your figure is off by $550 trillion.


*Citation needed* on the highlighted part.




Tell that to Standard &amp; Poors who recently got their asses spanked with a paddle by the New York Attorney General.

This is in New York City near City College of New York.

Because O.P. put a nice caption on a picture of a bunch of women smiling because of photo of them is being taken?

He is already being helped out. The problem is that no one really knew about his financial state.

Thank bb. Still, not a cult, not a cult, not a cult... keep telling yourself that until you begin to feel impressionable.

Because not living in America would make a difference? Federal authorities are still going investigate his criminal enterprise and demand for his extradition and I highly, highly doubt that other countries would turn down that request.

This is true! But many people still use cars. Like New York City, businesses hubs are all spread out and while most commuters use rail, subway, cabs, and buses, a large percentage of people own cars as well.

Were you talking about bitcoiners being generally more clueless and myopic than the general population? Because that is the only thing your original post revealed.
@_date: 2015-02-10 18:27:45
I do.
@_date: 2015-02-10 02:38:17
It's a photo of women smiling because a picture is being taken of them. seems appropriate.
@_date: 2015-02-12 02:25:42
Yes, trolls are necessary to undermine cult like sub cultures.
@_date: 2015-02-06 13:05:31
Of course you did! Now go ahead and name for all of us 5(and if you're serious, 6) separate entities where you used bitcoin to pay for your goods. Please.
@_date: 2015-02-09 14:20:25
Good lord, did you just use a Mike Maloney video as a method of giving credence to your comment? Would you also like to point me to Alex Jones as a credible source on what climate change is all about?
@_date: 2015-02-06 17:54:15
And this is why no one takes you guys nor bitcoin seriously.
@_date: 2015-02-10 02:43:24
My previous comment wasn't ad hominem. My previous comment was a straight up insult directed towards you.
@_date: 2015-02-06 19:10:14
Good! Now say it with me: to the moon!
