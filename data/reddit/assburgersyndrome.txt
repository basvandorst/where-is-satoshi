No, Trendon Shavers is the one with the baseball cap on (next to guy giving middle finger).

Yes, they are assumed independent. And you're right, its not really true. Independence is assumed, but then the co-variance is measured. Fitting the model is what measures the co-variance.
And yes, there is incitement to trade in the same direction of a big order. Because the bigger the trade, the more likely it is to be an informed trade. (or rather than the size of one trade, its the amount of trades per time interval). As the article mentions, it has the same "statistical mechanics" as some physical systems, eg earthquakes. I.e., its not *necessarily* true that a bigger earthquake will follow after some smaller tremors. But that it was tends to happens. In other words, trends have the tendency to continue, but sometimes they do reverse.

Another way to look at it, is that production stops being profitable, or at least equally as much a crapshoot as speculation, when future prices are uncertain. Future prices become more uncertain when liquidity supply is lower than demand (spreads get bigger when that happens; supplying liquidity is placing limit orders, taking liquidity is placing market orders). Its when liquidity dries up that markets go haywire (you get big price spikes and crashes, due to the enormous spread). So maybe more liquidity is part of the solution here, not part of the problem.

Third parties will still be needed to store all the fiat IOUs which back the price of bitcoin. These third parties are called exchanges. The market needs that fiat on the order books supporting the price, or the price collapses.

But its a broad brush to paint all of HFT as non-productive skimming and front-running. Read the book "Dark Pools: The Rise of the Machine Traders and the Rigging of the U.S. Stock Market". The scandalous part comes when you have exchanges which, at the behest of HFT firms, secretly implement special order types which can effectively front-run the standard, documented order types. With a system like that, the inner-circle who know the secret order types become liquidity parasites on the outer-circle of statistics PhD's who are actually doing the hard work of trying to provide liquidity to a chaotic, emotionally-driven mob of market speculators.

Can anyone clarify what they mean by "bitcoin transfers"? Does that mean no bitcoin deposits, not even small ones? Or just large bitcoin withdrawals?

Even without government fiat, there would still be speculation. If the whole world used nothing but bitcoin and alt-chains, there would still be speculation between them, and speculation on the price of everything else. Even if the government stopped printing, who could stop a horde of alt-chain promoters from pump-n-dump schemes to sell their pet crypto-currencies? Who is to say which crypto-currency is artificial and which one is honest?
Speculation is inevitable. The definition of free markets pretty much means that participants are free to speculate. The association that an artificial market/currency will be plagued by speculation, while an honest/free market will not, doesn't make sense.

The criminal complaint never said he wired $80k to a bank account in australia. It claimed that DPR had said "Not long ago, I had a clean hit done for $80k". It also claimed that DPR sent 1,670 BTC (~$150k) to redandwhite, including the transaction record (transaction hash?).
Where are you getting this $80k wire transfer to a bank account?

imaged since mid-2012? I thought the FBI doc said the image was from July 24 2013...
