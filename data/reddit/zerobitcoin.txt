May be Satoshi was not a deity or infallible but he was the one who ever better understood what Bitcoin is and what could be! Better than any other person in the world even now!

In YOUR opinion they are doing what you say, you can be wrong.
@_date: 2016-06-13 11:39:49
The year was wrong, just this.
@_date: 2016-06-12 15:08:06
I strongly agree.

In the next years, maximum by the 2020, the bitcoin price will be 10000 usd.

Bitcoin cultist? Again? Do you call everyone as this? What are you? A blockchain cultist? Or an eth r3 fan?
@_date: 2017-08-08 09:51:45
Bitcoin yes, altcoins such eth will know decline

So if you bought it in the worst moments still you have 3 times more in 4 years and half, if you bought at 1200 usd in the worst moment , what are you complaining about?

 You need better glasses!

I take pleasure in seeing R3 and all bankers fail, a lot of pleausure, almost an orgasm.

What is it over?
@_date: 2017-04-16 19:24:03
Core, Blockstream!
@_date: 2017-04-16 18:49:07
Early adopters have to step out of Bitcoin because they are millionaire? This way of thinking is insane. Lets fork Roger, we want the real Bitcoin back!!
@_date: 2017-04-17 21:05:41

@_date: 2016-12-02 02:53:27

@_date: 2016-07-07 09:13:35
