Is there anyone bought coin in LiteKoin? Prices seem too much cheaper. A key question is why they don't sell coins via well known exchange sites like MtGox, BitStamp...

Are deposits accepted by MtGox now, I am not sure. Does anyone here know?

It was my hope, it was my future that I bought bitcoin. I paid years of my saving to him and trusted him (or to mt.gox). Now I still believe in bitcoin and bitcoin's future. But I cant buy bitcoin because i have no such money. Karpeles must go in jail as soon as possible, Japan must do that. Because he has stollen our money or he cant save. I have never known about Katpeles but I KNEW JAPAN, I knew if a japan accused to stole anything he/she will make "harakiri". Government of Japan must do something about gox as soon as possible. Because Karpeles also killed trust of people to Japan. There is an exchange in my country and now working well as legal. I could transfer my bitcoins to there in few minutes but I didnt. Why? Because I trusted to Japan's company. This is the most important point. Also I trusted in Bitcoin Foundation because he was a member of it and Mt.Gox was Gold Member. Briefly I think I am a victim of "Trusting to Japan" and "Trusting to Bitcoin Foundation". Since last year, I repeatedly have adviced bitcoin almost everyone. While my friends working with Turkish exchange as known "BTCTurk" I was working with and trusting to  a Japan Company Mt.Gox. I feel deeply sorry and almost depressed. I am sure that 0.5 billion $ is not much for The State of Japan, but 10000$ is too much for me and my future. I lost 10000$ due to trusted on Japan and secondly to Bitcoin Foundation.

I have just signed in Overstock.com and wanted to buy some stuff but I couldnt see any option about Bitcoin payment. Then i logged in to their customer care chat service and told them about the problem which i mentioned above. She said that they are still working on it. But at chat time I noticed that they accepting bitcoin payment indirectly from Coinbase and told her about that. I suppose she has very little information about the subject. I investigated on the site and i saw Bitcoint payment option on  . I think this is a big news.

Mr. Karpeles, unfortunately you are in a big fault. It is obvious and you told that you have your own software for processing accounts, transactions, withdrawals and anything else, it that true? You are right or wrong, it doesnt matter but it has been valued and your exchange rate is 1/2 as btc/usd. What else is absent for you and your company, which other exchange companies had?

Yes, it is the same exactly, it seems down. It is the important QuarkCoin exchange site. Hope they will back :(

I advice that buy Quarkcoin with half or quarter of your btc account. I think it has chance to be at least x2-4 in a short term (It has x100 in last month). You can exchange it at Cryptsy.

Apple seems afraid of Bitcoin very much, because they have many credit card account registered in AppleStore.
