I appreciate your input.

It's not too late bro. A lot of people think BTC will be in the millions one day. Jumping from 5k to 12k is nothing.

Why would I be offended are you calling me a nocoiner

Has anyone actually figured out what is going on? because if it's climbing this high for no reason it's just going to drop again
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:14:22
U too

I haven't had problems with Robinhood or Coinbase. It's not ideal but it's convenient. What are people saying bad about Robinhood?

Eh depends how much you need the money. If I was in high school I would cash out immediately and feel like the richest kid ever. But at this point in life I guess I'm more inclined to hold out and see if BTC reaches 1 million like John McAfee is telling everyone lol.

BTC is not the only crypto in town. If I were you I'd focus on other types of crypto like ChainLink and Iota. Hold your breath and hope they explode.

I'm going to miss all my family and friends as they melt in nocoin purgatory, but not really.

That's what I'm here to figure out. I have no idea. Starting to come back down though.
Edit: NOPE!!

What did he mean by this?

I bought at 5k and I was so tempted to sell after I reached a 100% return but I'm hanging on for the ride. ��THAT'S THE WAY I LIKE IT BABY I DON'T WANT TO LIVE FOREVER��

Well I'm happy to be out with almost triple my money. Probably not going to use them again
@_date: 2019-06-22 04:23:49
Lol fixed. I have no idea why it entered my head that could make sense.

I just sold all the crypto I bought on Robinhood. This is the first time BTC has gotten hot since they started doing crypto offerings and I feel like they are going to mess it up. ������⏳
