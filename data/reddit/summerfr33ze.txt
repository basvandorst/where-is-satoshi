Even if they did bring the great depression there would've been no economy to crash without banking. Banking brings a massive expansion of credit without which creating a big company would be impossible and creating a small one would be a hundred times harder. The nerds could not have created internet companies without capital that just wouldn't exist without banking. Bitcoin doesn't provide a replacement for banking at all (although Ethereum does). Your understanding of how finance works comes from libertarian internet memes. Read a book.

Technically he allowed a man named Harold Brown to use his equipment and labs to electrocute dogs. I've never seen anything that was properly sourced to prove he actually electrocuted animals on his own. If you read the article you posted you'll notice that it claims he electrocuted Topsy. It also contains other false information so I wouldn't rely on these kinds of articles. Wikipedia is generally a way better source because false information is generally challenged and removed.

Really now? Maybe on a history sub, but in general on reddit  (or YouTube, or many other sites) if you see a post about either Tesla or Edison you'll see about a hundred posts about how great Tesla was or how Edison was an evil bastard and then zero that actually talk facts. This is about the fifth time I find one of these posts and I have to be the first (or one of the very few) to point out that no, Edison didn't really electrocute an elephant and no, Edison didn't just "steal" from his employees/competitors.

Edison didn't personally electrocute dogs. He allowed an electrical engineer named Harold Brown to electrocute dogs in one of his labs. Harold Brown had no financial interest in Edison's company. He truly believed that AC power was dangerous and would kill many people. This was based on an actual series of deaths caused by AC based systems in NYC. It's also a small part of Edison's legacy, and I could just as easily make Tesla look bad. Edison pledged never to develop weapons of war, and was not known as a supporter of eugenics. Tesla tried to develop a death ray and was an ardent supporter of eugenics. See how easy that is?
EDIT: Also, I really doubt Edison actually thought that AC was superior, because if he did, the smart business decision was to switch to AC like a lot of his employees had been telling him to. He was erring on the side of caution due to the perceived danger associated with the higher voltages involved in AC. This was a period of about five years where he made a misjudgment about a technology, but it's overshadowed by his other accomplishments, like creating one of the first industrial labs where great minds came together and made entire new industries.

This is just false. The first invention of Edison's that made him famous was the first device to record and playback sound, the phonograph. He created this before he even had employees, and was dubbed "The Wizard of Menlo Park" for it. At his lab he played a lead role in developing the technologies built by it, everything from practical lightbulbs, to a universal stock ticker, to helping develop the most advanced motion picture camera of it's time. Saying "nearly all of his so called inventions were invented by his underlings" is just factually incorrect. And since you called them "so-called" inventions, I'm curious what your definition of an invention is. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 11:42:24
"I say he had a random guy electrocute dogs"
Except that's not what happened. He was contacted by Harold Brown who was at that point already known for his anti-AC views because of deaths due to AC in NYC. Words matter. If you have to distort history just to make a point then what ground do you stand on? And actually calling Edison a "non contributing benefactor makes me think you don't have the slightest idea of the contributions of Edison himself. It's ironic you disparage the 20th century way of doing things when it was usually Edison coming up with the ideas and implementing them with his employees, compared to the usual modern CEO who's usually focused purely on executive decisions.

It wasn't contract work. Tesla was already being paid for it as an employee. And it was basic work fixing machines, its not the same thing as selling a patent.

The article I got was this:
So you're conflating insider trading by either an employe(s) at the company or an outsider with knowledge of the company with the company itself engaging in a pump and dump scheme that would immediately implicate them? If Coinbase added a shitcoin to their fund everybody would know about it, people who owned the fund would sell, and they'd lose their management fee. It's totally crazy.

The information on Harold Brown is on the War of the Currents page too
"Brown, determined to prove alternating current was more dangerous than direct current, at some point contacted Thomas Edison to see if he could make use of equipment to conduct experiments.[\[fn 2\]]( Edison immediately offered to assist Brown in his crusade against AC companies. Before long, Brown was loaned space and equipment at Edison's West Orange, New Jersey laboratory, as well as laboratory assistant [Arthur Kennelly](
Brown paid local children to collect stray dogs off the street for his experiments with direct and alternating current.[\[64\]]( After much experimentation killing a series of dogs, Brown held a public demonstration on July 30 in a lecture room at [Columbia College]( With many participants shouting for the demonstration to stop and others walking out, Brown subjected a caged dog to several shocks with increasing levels of direct current up to 1000 volts, which the dog survived. Brown then applied 330 volts of alternating current which killed the dog. Four days later he held a second demonstration to answer critics' claims that the DC probably weakened the dog before it died. In this second demonstration, three dogs were killed in quick succession with 300 volts of AC.[\[66\]]( Brown wrote to a college that he was sure this demonstration would get the New York Board of Electrical Control to limit AC installations to 300 volts. Brown's campaign to restrict AC to 300 volts went nowhere but legislation did come close to passing in Ohio and Virginia.[\[67\]](  
As for Topsy's electrocution, Edison's film company went to film Topsy's electrocution. that's why his name is on the film. Again the electrocution happened a decade after the War of the Currents ended and Edison was no longer in the electricity business. Edison would have no motive to electrocute Topsy. The only information that contradicts this was fabricated over time. As for people who doubt that Edison personally electrocuted animals, they would include anyone who has read the actual history.

Basically yes, it's this need for a hero/villain story where you have this god-like figure and you need a devil who's trying to bring them down. So every bad part about Edison's life is magnified whereas every good part about Tesla's is magnified. So for instance, people will claim something like "Edison stole the idea for the light bulb" because he innovated on previous light bulbs, even though those light bulbs were not long-lasting or commercially practical. Tesla's main contribution was the \*commutatorless\* AC motor, but nobody claims that he stole the idea from earlier AC motors, and some people, and that Oatmeal comic about Tesla, go as far as to claim that he "invented AC". This is ridiculous because AC was around before he was born. And Tesla and Edison wouldn't have had anything to do with each other at all except that Tesla worked at Edison's lab for a short amount of time and sold a patent to Edison's competitor. So yeah, they're two men who didn't actually have much to do with each other, and probably only met each other a few times at Edison's lab. The story is just convoluted to fit a narrative that people who don't care about history can be entertained by. You could just as easily make a hero/villain narrative about Tesla and Marconi, and it would probably be more accurate given that they actually had a patent dispute.

I think crypto will mostly be a currency for making transactions within virtual worlds, and then when those virtual worlds get big enough people will start to use it more in the real world.  The advantage of crypto in a virtual world is that you don't have to build any central banking system into the software so the economy would be easier to implement and be less vulnerable to hacking. Smart contracts will allow pretty much every kind of transaction you can do in real life without central control. You could get a mortgage on a virtual house that's coded as a smart contract, and instead of it being issued by a bank in the game it would be kept on the blockchain. This allows more scalability because the server running the virtual world doesn't have to keep track of everything.

"Because ultimately, Tesla was right about AC distribution vs. DC. Everything you use today is because of what Tesla's work"
And the work a hundred other people did in AC. Tesla's main contribution was a commutatorless AC Motor, which was invented concurrently by another inventor in the same year.
"kind of a jerk in general most notably for stiffing Tesla out of money "
I assume you're talking about the entry in Tesla's autobiography, My Inventions, where he says " *The Manager had promised me fifty thousand dollars on the completion of this task but it turned out to be a practical joke. This gave me a painful shock and I resigned my position.”*
The problem with this is that we don't know who "the manager" is. It also doesn't make sense that Tesla was offered what would be a million dollars in today's money for his work fixing machines. If Tesla didn't take it as some kind of asshole joke then he was misreading the situation. It's not like they just hand out a million dollars to employees as a job well done. 
@_date: 2018-06-16 19:20:41

That's a myth. Topsy The Elephant was electrocuted a decade after the War of the Currents ended by the amusement park where she lived, for killing a spectator, among other things. Edison wasn't even involved in the electricity business at that point and his former company had switched to AC power distribution by then. 
[  
Edison believed AC was dangerous, but it's pretty irrelevant to his legacy given what he achieved. But you'll never hear about his achievements on the internet because people would rather believe in internet myths about the War of The Currents than actual reality. 
@_date: 2018-06-16 19:24:16
I'd love to dispute this again. This idea that tesla was screwed out of pay is based on an entry in Tesla's journal where he claimed"*The Manager had promised me fifty thousand dollars on the completion of this task but it turned out to be a practical joke. This gave me a painful shock and I resigned my position.”*
The problem with this is that there's a good chance that the manager he's referring to isn't actually Edison but someone else in the company. The other problem is that $50,000 would be over a million dollars in today's money and Tesla should've known that the company wouldn't actually have that kind of money on hand to pay as a bonus. This is not "screwing tesla out of tens of thousands of dollars of pay" this is a manager just being an asshole.

"...JUST because you believe it will be worth more money someday you are by definition - gambling"
OK Let's define some things:
Investment- In general, to **invest** is to allocate money in the expectation of some benefit in the future
Gambling-  **Gambling** is the wagering of [money]( or something of [value]( (referred to as "the stakes") on an [event]( with an uncertain outcome with the primary intent of winning money or material goods.
OK so we've established that the line between investment and gambling isn't so clear, and you can't say that investing bitcoin is by definition gambling but not by definition investment. Bitcoin just isn't that useful as money in its present state, but I think it probably will be in the future. Why should I be using it now when I don't think it's useful now? Generating transactions just for the sake of transactions is not sustainable and will probably just increase volatility as a bunch of people do it, decide it's a waste of time, and then just give up. It's better if people just use Bitcoin when it makes sense to use Bitcoin. People held Amazon stock for years with the expectation that eventually someday the company would turn a profit, and similarly, people will hold bitcoin for years until it has a good use case. I don't think it will be long before cryptocurrencies become the official currencies of virtual worlds and \*that\* is a proper use case for crypto. I'm holding my Ether because I am certain that virtual worlds will be an amazing use case for Ethereum. If everyone who held Ether went out and started spending it now it would have a short term effect and there'd be no point to it. If we wait until the use case arrives it'll go from nobody actually using it as a currency to \*everyone\* using it as a currency. I want to be holding Ethereum then, because at that point I will make a really good return on my money.

None of those are good reasons for widespread adoption of Bitcoin over the next few years. Banks closing an account for using Bitcoin isn't an issue for people who don't use Bitcoin. Most people don't regularly make large cash transactions, or do wire transfers for over $10,000, or gift people large amounts of money. Most people are not going to learn Bitcoin just to do these things, especially considering buying all of that Bitcoin is going to raise it's own flags, just like you said, and also considering like I mentioned people are wary of the volatility. Theyre only going to use Bitcoin for those purposes if they already regularly use Bitcoin. Which would only happen if a use case for Bitcoin popped up within the next few years that drove adoption. I'm not saying Bitcoin isnt going to be really popular in the future. I'm saying if you make claims about it making up 10% of the economy like Tim Draper is doing then you need to explain why people would be regularly using it. 
@_date: 2019-09-17 20:09:26
Full control is certainly not the current reality of bitcoin. People have no idea about whether their bitcoin will be worth more or less from day to day, their money is less secure than it would be in a bank (it's possible to lose a key, but in order to lose money from a bank the entire country's financial system would have to break down.) In terms of control the only clear benefit of Bitcoin is making it easier to evade taxes or launder money. You can't have something equivalent to the security of a bank with bitcoin. And as for your whole libertarian pseudoeconomics trash vs governmental ass kissing thing, it's a false dichotomy. Why don't we just do neither? Fiat sucks because inflation sucks and it's expensive to move money across borders. Bitcoin sucks for a whole host of reasons. Ethereum is the future. Peace.

@_date: 2018-07-27 00:11:34
Right, but people have to start adopting it first before everyone starts using it. In order for that to happen Bitcoin needs a use case that a lot of people want it for. So discussions about the near future of bitcoin need to involve use cases, not things that people don't actually care about in a currency. The reason why I invested in Ethereum is that I think that smart contracts will play a massive role in virtual worlds. That's the kind of thing that discussions of the value of crypto have to be about. 
@_date: 2019-09-17 17:42:06
Those ignorant people have no control over society and there's really no use in making childish jokes about them because they're not going to learn anything from it. This sub has to be more about convincing smart people that bitcoin is more useful or secure or what have you than regular currency instead of being memes full of libertarian pseudoeconomics trash that makes the entire crypto community look like a bunch of schizophrenic retards. And it really shouldn't be that hard but then how are you supposed to elevate a discussion full of people whose understanding of economics goes as far as some ron paul blog post.

"Everyone will be using crypto 4 years from now because it's more secure 
Except thefts from your bank acct are pretty rare and they are insured against anyway, and everyday people run a much higher risk of losing their Bitcoin wallet and being unable to recover it, or having it on an exchange and having it be hacked. 
"Also it's deflationary, so it doesn't lose value"
Meaningless when it's so volatile that most people would just convert it back to dollars
Neither of the reasons he gave make sense for why most people would be using it.
