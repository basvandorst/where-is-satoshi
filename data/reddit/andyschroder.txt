In the free world, you have a choice of your unit system.
I personally prefer a rationally designed unit system, that is designed to work well with the decimal counting system that has been used for the last several hundred (maybe thousand) years. With a global unit of exchange, there is no reason not to use a global unit of measure.
With bitcoin, you are already working with a different currency, so there is already a conversion factor, so there is no reason to not also adopt a more logical measurement system along with a more logical currency.

Gases, liquids, supercritical fluids, liquid vapor mixtures, and any other "fluid like" product, such as grain, cereal, etc. are all possible applications. The device can also be adapted to things like electric car battery charging, which is a flow of electrons, but not really a fluid. The work flow may need to change a bit for longer duration purchases (like battery charging).

I appreciate the tip, but I'm a bit weary of the "changetip" application. When I try to collect the tip, it makes me connect my reddit account to "changetip". It requests my identity permission, which seems a bit excessive based on the extent of the privileges defined in the reddit api ( If you are able to explain to me in a technical way why I should trust this process of connecting accounts, or send a tip straight to my bitcoin address shown on this page,  I would appreciate it. Sorry to be difficult here for a .865mBTC tip, but I am just not comfortable to the "changetip" application.

You should probably check out my proposed bluetooth related BIPs. They do not include BLE, but could be extended.

The payee must have an internet connection. This can usually be a stable wired connection because the payee is normally in a fixed location that they own or rent. If they are a mobile vendor then they may need to have a dedicated cellular internet plan with a high gain antenna mounted on the top of their vehicle (if in a remote area). The point is that the payee is usually in a lot more control or knowledge of the location of sale (and therefor the internet connection), whereas a payer is not (particularly with fuel sales).

I am still searching for a pilot installation customer for the technology.
I believe that barter exchanges are legal in most parts of the free world.

Thanks for the info. Will have to assess the applicability of this technology.

Some similiar thoughts are included in here:

Presently I have implemented a fixed sale rate. As you will notice in my first video, I mention the importance of ancoring the purchasing power of bitcoin to physical commodities that are regularly consumed by society, and not centralized currency exchanges or collectable commodities. This was a principle motivation for the creation of this technology in the first place. With this goal in mind, I'd like to encourage manual changes in sale rates, which will provide more stability in the purchasing power. If customers do desire rapidly varying exchange rates tied to centralized currency exchanges, I can provide that capability as well, and if I do, I will fix the exchange rate to that which occured when the bitcoin payment address was presented to the customer. Fuel stations don't currently change their sale rate while you are in the middle of pumping, and I don't plan to do so either.

I'd also like to remind everyone about my bitcoin enabled fuel dispsenser that I've developed....

You might want to read some of satoshi's writings:
I have not yet implemented this kind of statistical analysis yet, but plan to do so. The same problem exists for each and every point of sale system that will ever exist for bitcoin. There are companies working to provide risk assessment of this type of situation. I'm not concerned that the problem can't be mitigated. If it can't, bitcoin has some big problems moving into the real world, that aren't specific to my device.

I think you are trying to make things way more complicate than they need to be. The point of bitcoin is to remove as many middle men, steps, vendor lock in, and complexities from trade as possible.

1. QR code can initiate the bitcoin payment protocol over bluetooth, however, BIP72 only supports one URL which isn't good for backwards compatibility. I will be proposing a new draft BIP in a few days that will expand the number of URLs that can be provided. So, as of right now I have the QR code configured for https based payment protocol, and will be producing another video soon that shows payment protocol over https.
2. This is an issue and it has been suggested by someone else to do what you are saying. I'll have to discuss this with the wallet developers to see what their thoughts are. The best way to do it would be to add a field to the payment protocol to pass the data. I'm not sure how desired this would be though because it then puts sole trust in the payee to provide valid blockchain data and Bitcoin is supposed to be a trustless system.

I would like to share my prototype fuel pump that accepts bitcoin with everyone reading this in case you have not already seen it yet.
@_date: 2014-10-13 01:07:02
Thanks for the video suggestions. I am always trying to improve my video production skills!
You may want to watch one of my earlier videos that is a much quicker and simpler demo.
I have no plans to cross fade or time lapse any part of the demonstration. There are too many fake bitcoin devices out there that I need to be clear that this is REAL.
Bluetooth low energy is not involved in this version of the fluid disepenser, but I am considering it in the future. It's still an emerging technology.
I believe a screen is required by most weights and measures regulations. Even the size of the lettering is typically specified. However, regulations can be revised if there is enough interest as technologies evolve.. If you watch my first demonstration video, you will see an HTML based interface that I developed. This was just a proof of concept though, so the refresh rate was quite low, but it can be done without requiring a specific app.

Any contacts you can send my way regarding commercialization would be greatly appreciated (fuel station owners, fuel station designers/contractors, etc.). I'm always interested in hearing about other applications people are interested in because it helps me know what other markets are of most interest.

I am looking into why this pump is a little loud. However, in future installations where the entire station is bitcoin equipt, a central sumbersible turbine pump would be used, which would be much quieter, and also placed remotely underground where the customer will not hear it.
Removal of the nozzle is required in order for a QR code to be displayed.
If you just have a button you can press to request a new QR code, then there is no way to know if some just walks up and presses that button and with no intention to actually purchase fuel (some delinquent kid/adult, or someone trying to spy on the fuel station owner and track their sales). Or maybe someone intended to purchase fuel, but then changed their mind (maybe they didn't actually have any bitcoins with them like they thought). Or maybe the person is just really slow at making payment (maybe a kid is acting up, or they got a phone call immediately after they pressed a QR code request button). In all these cases, how do you know when to time out the QR code that was displayed?
The process may not be what you are used to, but there are actually no more steps this way. Especially when this is integrated into dispensers that have a small switch that the nozzle touches when it is removed (so you don't have to manually rotate the switch like I have configured).
@_date: 2014-02-04 01:36:39
stay tuned. version 2 will be announced soon....
@_date: 2014-10-12 18:42:46
1. The reason the nozzle has to be removed first is because it is a proof of work indicating the customer has a real intention to make a purchase. I could choose to add a button for this but the user is already going to remove the nozzle anyway, so it's an extra unecessary step. The proof of work is needed because a new bitcoin address is generated for each customer, after the customer has indicated a payment would like to be made. The goal is to reduce the number of unused bitcoin addresses and also not allow anyone to harvest bitcoin addresses that a pump issues before a customer makes payment (this improves the privacy and security of the system). So, QR code is not displayed and NFC radio is off on the disenser until they remove the nozzle.
2. Please check out some of my previous videos. I'll also be creating another video soon that demonstrates the refund process using the bitcoin payment protocol.
3. There are a lot of extensions that can be made to the payment protocol to improve the process. I'm only interested in supporting features that I'm confident will be adopted by many wallet creators, so what gets included will be determined over time as discussion occurs with the wallet creators.

Mycelium is not the only one! There are many non-BIP70 wallets out there, but I at least wanted to showcase Mycelium for its HD capability and open source design, because there are many wallets that are still single address, closed source, and give their users no private key control, which is even worse.

My bitcoin fluid dispenser also features offline payments using bluetooth and NFC. It doesn't use bitpay and is a peer to peer node:
Here are some details regarding a draft specfication of the protocol:
@_date: 2014-10-12 16:10:39
Micropayment channels are definitely a consideration. The main reasons I am currently focusing on the prepay process right now is because fuel payments aren't typically micropayments and they are also quickly returned. Also, I don't know of any bitcoin wallet GUI that even supports micropayments right now, so it is hard to demonstrate in a simple way.

Well, geographically yes, but organizationally, I see those 1,000 nodes to be really be 1 since amazon is a single entity.
@_date: 2016-12-03 15:20:20
Yes, but I'd rather help other nodes more that are promoting more decentralization. Why waste my bandwidth on nodes that are in a data center controlled by a single organization when I could instead provide more resources to other nodes that are not centrally controlled?

I am aware of those links, but bitcointalk.org is a website that has known to be hacked. I don't really trust it because it is a third party, and even less because it is a third party that has been known to be hacked.
I'm aware of "goatpig" stating his new key on that link, but I don't see why that statement should be trusted without other parties endorsing the key. I don't see why one would trust just an announcement by someone who alleges to be "goatpig".
Although "etotheipi" has indicated an endorsement of "goatpig" in one of the links above, first that endorsement is not signed, and second, it indicates no public key for "goatpig" to trust.
