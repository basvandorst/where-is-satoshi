I wholeheartedly agree regarding CyanogenMod, though I haven't touched a stock Nexus device in a while to really compare the two.  There are a ton of useful apps that require root, TitaniumBackup being my favorite.  Backing up automatically to my SD card + Dropbox (or wherever) is very useful when playing around with ROMs and not wanting to do the whole re-installation process manually..

Ha, awesome.  I hope the new OS and hardware will be to your liking, especially with the more accepting nature of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
Wireless charging, alternate keyboards, custom ROMs (though stock should be quite nice on the N5), freedom of apps and app stores.. Just a few things you'll have gained with the new platform.

Not rooting doesn't mean you're necessarily any more or less secure than someone who has rooted.  
Though I do agree with no assumptions, at some point you need to take responsibility for reading reviews, installing, and inevitably trusting the developers who created your OS and your apps.  I think it'd be safer to assume that the stock ROMs from Google, CyanogenMod, and other reputable sources are fairly safe.  App wise, don't download sketchy programs, same as on a desktop OS.  And to your point, definitely encrypt backups of personal data.  TitaniumBackup offers this feature (at least in the Pro version), and the OS also has an encryption method that would ensure a lost phone would remain locked (data wise) to potential intruders.
