I should clarify, by Bitcoin noob I meant I'm trying to learn on how it is being used by speculators, what are causing the dips and highs, how the miner's margins are being changed, how it is affected by global currency markets, i.e. crash of ruble, use in countries with high inflation etc.
I wouldn't be so quick to jump to the biggest thing since the Internet, Bitcoin has yet to be challenged in a real regulatory environment, besides the Russians banning the usage. Globally it is a drop in the bucket in terms of BTC in circulation even though I want to see it succeed outside the influences of fiscal authorities. If it succeeds it will be a game changer, but in its current state, it isn't yet, in my uneducated opinion.

Yup! I bought at $500 and got to see it drop to below $300.

That's just how I see it myself! Which is why I'm interested in seeing it succeed, I bought a small amount of BTC myself at around $500 and got to see it drop to below $300, so I'm wary about its volatility of it's currency on a day to day basis until it picks up more stability.

Thanks for the tip! I do cautiously follow the potential future of Bitcoin which is why I'd love to find out more about it.

Me too! I agree that cryptocurrencies are going to revolutionize the world, I'm just not sure it will be BTC which will be the one that ends up becoming the largest.

I have a bit of a cautious investment in bitcoin myself but I'm really hesitant about Bitcoin's price going up. 
From my gut, I think Bitcoin is just going to be a tester currency, they're feeling it out and letting it build before it has any actual sizable effect on any currencies. Russia is banning it in 2015 and we could see Bitcoin facing similar bans elsewhere in the leadup to a regulated virtual currency a la Bitcoin. It strikes me as similar to the boom of online poker sites into a multi billion dollar industry in the US only to be severely neutered once they decided to drop the hammer.
There is no single person to prosecute in the case of Bitcoin but the regulatory risk of the US or other countries just straight up banning it is too high. Even the words of the Fed chairman that virtual currencies show long term promise doesn't hold much cred until there is actual legality built in for Bitcoin.

Bitcoin trending towards $130 in the near future? 
Is there a reason for Chinese speculators for leaving the market? i.e. when there's a lot of money exiting China and parking into assets like foreign companies, why would they leave the market in BTC, unless they see BTC as overvalued at present?
Would the Russian's ruble crisis have any effect on BTC? Even though they've supposedly banned the usage of Bitcoin there.

That's why I worry for the future of Bitcoin because those outdated and corrupt systems usually go to heavy measures to ensure their survival.

Because Trump is President.
