The number of addresses can be increased.


There always will be. The amount of decimal places can be increased, increasing the supply without increasing the total amount. If say, 200 years into the future, 1 Satoshi is worth $1 (assuming usd are still in existence), and we need smaller change, more decimal places can be included.

Whenever I explain it, it always turns out that I've been talking to trolls. Not saying you are, just saying I've wasted my time each and every time before (which is kind of frustrating).
So I stopped myself explaining it a while back. But I'll say it in brief.
Infinite addresses (they can be increased) - maths
Infinite coin (within a finite amount) - maths
Infinite maths (the maths that the network works on is infinite) - maths
A while back some clever mathematician discovered the multiple infinites, numbers within numbers. It was pretty, but at the time not so applicable. Such things have been used in physics since. Bitcoin also makes use of combining multiple infinites. This is rather powerful, and obviously maths based.

Let  us say, for the sake of argument, that the banking cartel that runs the world, also runs the US Fed (gov &amp; money printer). The IMF is owned by the US and likely a few of the other 'greek financiers' that we keep hearing about.
Now lets pretend that the aim of the banking cartel is to see how much they can make Greece bleed, and greeks start fleeing to bitcoin via Coinbase.
Wondering how the banking cartel will react to that, would they use their US thugs to attack Coinbase (on various levels) .. or feel helpless as they've already exerted as much obvious anti-bitcoin force in the US as they've been able to do without overly revealing their domination/control of the US.

It is unfeasibly large and fixed, currently. It can be increased with code. A coin can not currently be divided below one satoshi, but it can be implemented to do so.
In around 3,160 years (if I remember correctly), there might be address issues, depending upon the rate of population growth it could be sooner. But such an issue will be addressed far sooner than that.

That said though, for my own reasons (which I can't say why, sorry, because this is obviously not my real handle), I do support the 20MB move.
And the 'bigger block size' issue will occur again. It will have to increase further for mass adoption. 20MB is only the 1st time, to be quite honest, I am surprised that there is such a fuss about it.
And this point in time, with such an **extremely** low adoption rate it is far, far easier, to do a rollback if anything untoward occurs. 
There is now gain without much relative risk, and this is the time that such risk should be taken, there will be further obstacles to overcome, which will be far trickier than this. This has and is a great opportunity for the community to work together to solve such an issue.
In the future, the respective community will be far bigger.

medium of exchange (nationally and globally - can you throw your credit card at your computer screen and send funds to any individual in the world that has, say, a phone? internet access? an email address?)
fungibility - please send me 10c using your credit card
store of value - because what credit cards use (fiat) has increased its value by 95% over the last 100 years.. oh wait..

Ok, and how are the topics I highlighted not infinite?
Edit: Because of the attempted disparaging of my knowledge of Cantor, which is a mild ad hominen btw, it would have been better to use Cantor to prove me wrong, rather than just saying "you no understand Cantor, therefore you should not be listened to". The assumption is that **you** know Cantor better than the person you are saying does not. And if you really do, then you should use that knowledge to prove your point.
And because you have not answered as to how what I highlighted are **not** infinite. I feel the need to point you towards Cantor myself, indeed, the very same thing you are have brought up to say that I am wrong.
You referenced the very thing that backs up the infinite of Bitcoin while stating that the person doing so lacks an understanding of Cantor, presumably because you know Cantor better (which you might), but you have not seen how the continuum hypothesis is applicable, which leads your original premise to be questionable.

I agree, but not because of the volatility. You probably don't know (most don't), but most countries rely on volatility in the fiat market for their own survivability (they trade on the FOREX).
So it always makes me chuckle a bit inside when I hear people say stuff like you just did.
Also, it unfortunately shows your general lack of understanding of various businesses in the space that do currency conversions at no loss to volatility. But hey, don't let facts and reality keep you down!


Exactly, and explained above, the 'volatility' issue is a red herring used to detract from bitcoin and is actually something very much sought after, not just by nations, but also by a vast amount of traders the world over who are attracted to volatility. You can not make money from a completely stable currency the way countries and traders make money in the contemporary age.

It was a statement that I lacked knowledge of Cantor insinuating that because of the lack of knowledge my statement that bitcoin uses infinities was wrong.
(or was he saying that I lack knowledge of Cantor, but my statement of bitcoin is correct?)
The insinuation through lack of knowledge.
When if the opposition is providing a sound argument, then just state why its wrong. E.g. Bitcoin is not infinite because xyz and therefore does not fall under Cantor's theorems.
@_date: 2015-06-01 22:30:09

No but seriously, there a few reasons, capital control, identity, taxation. If a government fully adopted bitcoin as its national currency it would get none of these (though capital control is just excess bullshit). Without identity and taxation they would be starving themselves.

I disagree with that.
We are at the 3rd 'lull/dip', and at a much larger business adoption rate.
The adoption of bitcoin (and various digital currencies, because it won't all just flow into bitcoin), will be primarily done by the less wealthy. As initially, for the very wealthy, it has little interest. There is no perceived sense of financial injustice, nor need (not all people, just most).
And it is fair to say that the illegal elements of society was drawn to it first. With any precious metals, items, etc, in the past, societies illegal elements that tend to value its worth quicker than most. But saying that, the black market is huge and whatever is in digital currency is an extremely small % (probably less than 0.01% considering the total estimated $ worth of the black market).
So it's more likely that the less wealthy adopt bitcoin sooner than the average wealthy. And that the individual will before all big business and governments. 
Eventually (more) big business and then governments will adopt (partially or in all), but they won't throw 100% of their financial resources into it at once, they will bit by bit, and this will show the individual that it is worth adopting. And the individual will find it quicker, as they won't have to wait for specific risk factors to be addressed like big business and government will do.
There will still be some die hard individual that don't adopt until 'finally', but hey, there's always some..

Microsoft has competition - 
So does Adobe and google, and commodity based firms, all airlines, you can google each one and find them easily enough. I can't think of anything that does not have competition (apart from fiat pre-bitcoin), maybe there is something neither of us have thought of.
Fiat has had no competition for hundreds of years (originally it had gold/silver until that was phased out, and it is arguable whether it was forcibly phased out by the banks at the time).

How do they dampen volatility?
Do they not create illusionary wealth that can then be used for arbitrage over the entire sector, and this causes higher volatility as the market tries to equalize each time margin accounts are created/used?
For example .. What would be quicker for the market (via arbitrage) to equalize the value?
(1) If I sold 10 bitcoins on exchange B, and other traders arbitraged to equal the value. Or (2) if I sold 10,000 bitcoins on exchange B and arbitrage kicked in to equalize?

There exists trading groups, team with other traders, converge on an exchange sell/sell/sell/buy/buy/buy, etc, knock on effects.
But there are also HFT bots that equalize exchanges, so grouped traders would have to be careful and there's a fair chance of them losing out.

I can see shorts creating selling pressure .. but why would it create buying pressure?
If the shorts get cancelled/removed then yes, I can see that causing buying pressure, but whilst they exist, I see the pressure towards a selling trend (as the 'money' waits at the lower end, not the upper).

The decimal places can be increased (upon consensual agreement).
There are many types of infinities, numbers within numbers and so on.
So, yes, it is (potentially) infinite.
In 500 years time when we 'might' start running into "coins are running out" type of issues = add 2 decimal places (assuming bitcoin is still dominant or that money is even a 'thing' by then). And that's currency sorted for another 500-1000 years.
And its not even inflation. You simply can not do this type of economics within the current (fiat) system (it would otherwise be known as inflation, and as always, the extra funds are diverted to the already very wealthy).
Within an 'extra decimal' monetary system, nothing gets inflated, everyones wealth stays the same.

See ..
Your answer describes how its excellent .. for the individual, for greed/profit.
But how it helps the market no one seems to know ... ? Rather than creating extra volatility due shorts/calls and arbitrage ...
A downwards price spiral can be signaled without the need for margin trading. People can still trade and there are still clear signs of either upwards or downward trends, again, without margin.
I am honestly seeking an answer (if there is a suitable one), that addresses why its good for the market as a whole.
And I've seen others say "it's good for (stopping) volatility.." and never explain why .. as the reality and how it works in practice is that it creates extra volatility through excess arbitrage and market hype through illusion trading ..
Maybe I'm wrong .. but I've asked in a few places now and no one can seem to give a clear answer as to why its good for the market, not just for the individual profit.
You can make excellent profit with margin, especially with insider knowledge, and against newbie traders. Regardless of whether a market is crashing or not.
But margin trading also **relies** on volatility, 0 volatility = 0 profit, the more volatility in a sector the more a margin trader stands to make. It is in the best interest of a margin trader to create volatility. It's like making the town arsonist the chief fireman.
Short squeezing does not create extra volatility.. it just forces bears to become bulls, the volatility stays the same, it just changes direction.


That's financial colluding, and carries illegal elements (insider trading) depending on how its done. Short squeezing can occur regardless of how many traders collude, depending upon the sector.
But your answer of short squeezing does not address excess arbitrage caused by margin, which is what I was trying to point out that causes extra (unneeded) volatility within the market, and when margin calls occur this volatility increases (either way).
But hey, thank you for your time and answer :)
@_date: 2014-10-09 17:15:11
Hope you reply, serious question - out of curiosity, why exactly do you say Shorts are good for bitcoin?
For the individual, yes, making a profit out of others, sure. But good for the system?
Personally I disagree with them, potentially (in a larger market) they 'might' be useful, but overall I think they're damaging to the small economy and that not everything from the 'traditional system' should be copy/pasted onto the new system.
But that said.. I'm open to being convinced otherwise.

I would recommend to disallow the practice of margin trading in certain countries via certain regulations as a particular type of business (as an exchange).


Aye, as you say, hence my questions so I can formulate a clearer picture.


As mentioned, you can define regulations to eliminate the practice of margin trading, basically making it illegal, but yes, shorting would continue.


Yes, you are quite right and I agree, that individuals (or groups) could still borrow from other bodies to use to sell bitcoins, but then these would be the actual bitcoins (as they would need to move them onto a platform). These used for shorting would be 'real bitcoins', rather than 'illusionary' ones created by an exchange for their own and their (good) traders benefits.
And margin trading is so very easy to game with insider info.
I guess it would be better to say that I have no issue with 'shorting' then (if it (the borrow) was to come 'outside' the exchange platform), but the margin that allows excessive 'gaming the system', that's the particular issue, that I have issue with (too much issue!).
Thank you :)

That's just .. daft.
That's like saying "the businesses which accept credit/debit cards don't really accept credit/debit cards, they just accept hard cash"
These merchants accepting bitcoin are still making savings and offering their customers far more privacy and security and opening up their wares to a potentially (or already) far wider audience, the more they sell for bitcoin the more they will realize.
It would be better if they did keep it all as bitcoin, but you're missing quite a few significant points about accepting it all.

If say, you brought your bitcoins at $350, and when you transfer them back to dollars they are worth (avg) $500, which you get $500, then that counts as gains (the $150), and 'legally' you should state those gains and pay taxes on it.
But, that is the UK, I'm fairly sure it is the same in the US, but you should get that double checked.
Truth of the matter is that it is very hard for the IRS (or HMRC) to tell that you made profit and they rely on you giving up the information. If say you made a lot of profit and you suddenly had a speedboat (or something similar) outside your property, then they probably would investigate further.

Which is where Bitcoin fits in. Well done for answering your own doubt.
Remember, keyword - POTENTIAL (e.g. like the internet had/has the potential to be a global phenomenon (it's still widely unused, but is used globally and has far more potential use).
And the infrastructure (computers) for the internet still eluded most people when it 'started' (started getting attention, mid 90's). And of course all the software had to be built (and is still being built).
Yet most of the infrastructure for Bitcoin adoption is already there, just lacking software infrastructure which is being crazily built upon as we speak.

The banks set that up (the pre 1913 'panics'), check out various histories of certain nations around that time (Notables - Germany, US, UK). 
You might almost end up thinking that WWI was setup, prepared, and the 1913 Fed Reserve was all planned in advance (you might also think that the 1971 Nixon statements was also planned before WWII, after Europe and Africa's gold was stolen by the US).
It's difficult to tell everyone "STFU the USD is no longer based on gold", IF most countries still have vast amounts of their gold. But once you steal it all it becomes much easier to state that the world will be based on a paper currency that you control (in some cases it was 'given', for a different definition of 'given').

Hm, on a personal level one can 'disagree' with a business practice, and depending who that person is can pass that information on, and their opinions why.
Gravity is a natural force (as you know). Margin trading and shorts seems to have been created (by the borrower and lender, as you say), to be able to fleece the market for both parties (of newbie traders and the lender takes a larger cut).
I think borrowing bitcoins and selling bitcoins fall widely into different categories than creating and allowing margin.
Whether margin trading and shorts should exist within the digital sector is the question .. these things can be cleaned away with regulation, gravity can not.

If he put in 90% beginning of this year, then yes, he's made a loss (generally the only place it was so expensive was gox, which would have given him a 100% loss anyway).
Assuming he has not done that (seeing as he's talking happy), then possibly a loss still, assuming he did not buy any pre-Nov 2013.
But again ... that is if you are only looking at the value. If you look past the bitcoin at the blockchain tech, and you had a vague (or better) idea of what was going on around the world with regards to infrastructure and government/banking adoption, then you'd see it was a very good idea.
But! A risk, yes! But compared to most risks, at this point (5 years in), its a fair risk.

When is the torture, mutilation, abuse, of another living thing ever a 'good' thing? As mentioned above, sometimes an evil act might be necessary for the 'greater good', but it is still an evil act and should be recognized as such.
When you stop recognizing the evil that you (or anyone) is doing, 'because its right', leads to a dark way of thinking.

A documentary caught my eye couple weeks ago, some bloke buying a motorbike from the US (he was from the UK), they messed up his wire transfer 3 times (admittedly, 2 of the times was kind of his fault, though he stated he thought that the 'money experts' would inform him of any little mistake before trying to send his money).
They charged him each time for converting his gbp back and forth (as apparently they convert it before even checking that they can send it), which cost him a load more, because they also told him he lost money due to the forex volatility (on top of the charges for exchanging his money).
Poor old bloke was confused with all the info he needed to send, the bank was useless with assisting, only telling him each time the charges and the bounce back.
He did eventually get his motorbike, on the 4th attempt, after all the excess charges and exchange rate (back and forth each time), and I think it took over a month in the end.

You can make margin trading on digital currency platforms illegal by regulation.
But as someone else has pointed out to me, you can't stop shorting.
Though I have no particular issue of shorting, if traders are borrowing coins and then moving them onto a platform to short/trade, or whatever.
It's the creation of 'illusionary' coins to create excessive shorts (or to go long) that creates a distortion in the market and excessive volatility (and increased need for traders to cause hype).
That (margin trading) is a particular 'traditional' model/practice that I have been trying to .. place on top of the bitcoin sector model (in a localized view).. and whether it is 'needed', who does it serve (individuals or the market), whether its one of those 'old traditional tools' that should or should not exist within the crypto market.
And yes, as you've pointed out, 'margin trading' can/will exist, but you can eliminate it from exchanges.
And someone else pointed out, it would be driven underground if made illegal, probably yes, but then at least newbie traders wouldn't be fleeced and it eliminate a certain risk factor for individuals entering the sector.

Evil is evil.
If you do not understand what 'Evil' is, then go please sit in a corner and never come out.
What you are trying to describe is 'Right &amp; Wrong', in which, I do agree with you, that it is a matter of perspective.
But evil is evil and if I need to explain what is inherently evil.. again, go sit in a corner and never come out.
(yes, right and wrong do cross over into what is evil &amp; good, and sometimes people 'need' (a matter of perspective) to do evil things, but the actions themselves would still be evil)
Seriously... having to explain that some things are inherently evil no matter the reason, the act is still evil .. just leaves me feeling dirty ... 
Please go learn the difference between evil, right and wrong, and please please go learn what 'good' means, you make me sad :(

its repeated throughout this thread,
"omg, look at his tattoo, anyone with that tattoo can't be taken seriously"
Its what is referred to as ad hominem.
I could've replied to any of the other comments with a similar twist.
You don't need any specific '1st language' to understand what is being inferred, most people with english as their 1st language don't understand the ways things are inferred to dilute a proposition.
And the term is "words into his mouth"


If you don't understand that this is implying things (and is ad hominem), then well ... I can't explain it further, perhaps it is you who doesn't understand the English language as well as you think you do.

It would really take a few lectures to explain, and even then I doubt I could do it justice, and I've had problems with trying to explain to some people about the global state of the economy and why its in the shit hole it currently is.
And often I find its just a waste of my time to even bother trying to explain to people in r/bitcoin as a vast lot of people here are just trolls/shills.
I'll try to summarize though - 
1. Capital Controls are not part of the free market.
2. Attempts to control the market are done for the benefit of the controllers.
3. Market freedom always results in economic growth (note: not all markets are 'beneficial' for societies).
4. Since the endorsement of Capital Control through the Bretton Woods agreement the global economy has taken a nose dive, and continues to do so (see value of each and every fiat denomination for the last 44 years).
5. Job losses, businesses close, unemployment, and these are expected to increase (see G20 for more details).
That *should* be enough for you to start researching yourself. I suggest taking a look at the avg value of fiat denominations, and ask yourself, how did capital control contribute to starting WW1 and WW2.
If you don't know, you should do some research on what Capital Control really does and is.

That really really makes me cringe ... humanity is entrenched within herd mentality, you are more than that.
But I'll repeat what I said in another reply.. how does this help the system? 
I know and see clearly how this helps the individual make far more profit than otherwise.. but margin trading (and shorts) gives a false illusion that creates larger arbitrage and thus unnatural volatility across the market as people are 'playing' with fictional coins.
Honestly .. as I see it .. a bunch of people came together and cleverly came up with some vaguely complicated agreements (origin of margin trading) and happily patted each other on the back. As the trader would stand to make large profits (if traded well and against newbs, or had inside information) and the merchant/exchange stands to make profit on every transaction (and in most cases, the size of the transactions).
I hear people saying "it has a purpose." .. "its used in the traditional system, so it has a reason." etc, etc,
But .. apart from making a few individuals/groups richer at the cost of newbies and making the market/exchange (owners) richer .. how does it actually **help** the system? As opposed to causing more volatility via arbitrage via the illusion of extra coins on the market.
Edit: And yes, I agree it has a purpose, if that purpose is to make a few richer at the expense of others and the market, then sure. But people keep harping on about how its 'good for the system', which I think is utter crap, but as mentioned, willing to be persuaded otherwise.
@_date: 2014-09-16 14:22:42
Depends how you define 'risk'.
What you are comparing is when it was not accepted by any shops, no one really knew if it would 'take off', there were questions as to whether it was even legal, it was just considered an experiment, there was absolutely no use for them (apart from sending them back and forth to other 'hardcore' Cryptology nerds), it very well could have just been a stepping stone (still could be), had hundreds to low thousands of users (if not less), had only existed for 1-2 or less years.
Compared to (when at 1,000 dollars per 1) -
It was accepted by 10's of thousands of online businesses, accepted by 1000's of brick and mortar businesses (both global), was considered valuable (to the tone of $1,000), had already gone through numerous 'fire crucible' and hacking attempts, had already been discussed for 6+ months in the US congress, IRS, and various other governmental and other establishments across the world, had numerous organisationse setup to promote, establish and build around the technology. Had millions of users (debatable how many millions), had existed for 4-5 years.
Your idea of 'risk' is vastly different from my own perception of 'risk'.

I understand it.
But I don't understand why people think its good for the system.
I see why its good for individual greed/profit and how people can make and lose via shorting.
But I've seen quite a few people state how its good for the system, yet with no explanation why .. 
Personally I think its bad for the system, that it gives the perception of extra liquidity and increases the volatility of the market by providing arbitrage where arbitrage should not exist, this in turn robs the young/new traders who don't fully understand what they are doing, who are in fact drawn into trading into an illusionary market (margin) that is far easier to game than a market that does not allow margin trading.
So .. ye .. why is shorting good for the system (not for the individual) .. unfortunately I don't think you quite answered me.

Cost of living goes up, as measured by various factors (house prices being one of them).
Wage level stays the same (or in some cases goes down), or goes up very marginally against the rising cost of living.
= less income for the average family = inflationary (unlivable) spiral.
Bank of England (on inflation) -
It's not just the US facing this current issue, its the world.
Though they get deflation wrong, bitcoin is 5+ years proof of that (and as bitcoin is the only evidence of a deflationary system vs hypothesis, I'd personally go with the actual 5+ year evidence).

If I started a business, but I have a car that I use to drive back and forth to my business, must I then register the car under the business name?
If this logic holds true then - must everyone who uses a car for anything business related then register the car for the business?
Or must the person run the business, then they have to register all their vehicles under the business? Even if it was registered under their personal use before?
Or, they start a business, buy a car for personal use, part of that personal use is driving back and forth to the business, then it must be registered? (maybe picking up food, most small retailers do this)
I'm not sure how it is in the US to be honest, maybe it's different there, it seems so from what you are saying. If it is this way, are most cars in the US registered under businesses then?

You don't even understand what you're saying, hence why you can't explain it, you simply don't understand deflation because you've been spoon fed the dribble coming out of their mouths and you've been lapping it up.
And when you 'try' to explain it you realise that you're wrong so you 'pretend' not to want to explain it! hahahahahahahaaaaaaaaaa ... brilliant :D
Anyone but a retard (or someone who doesn't realise there's another option, or a banker, or a bankers tool and probably most politicians) wants to use wealth that will increase in spending value, not decrease.
There there, it's ok, you keep brown nosing the idiot economists who have trashed the global economy.

Trading on margin is a very very bad thing to do in the bitcoin sector at this time (in my honest opinion).
@_date: 2014-10-10 10:08:03
Thank you for your decent answer :)
See, what I'm wondering .. (unfortunately still) .. is why does a market need margin/shorts, etc, when such a similar method as you describe can also be used for price discovery without the need for margin.
I mean ... if someones already sold all their bitcoins (because they guessed the market wrong, or for whatever reason), then surely they should be excluded from the market, until they can readily enter it again (with 'real' funds instead of margin).
I understand margin, shorts, etc, etc, and I see how they are great for price discovery, and it is as you say, if someone has sold all their bitcoins (or whatever commodity/currency is involved), and they still want to fiddle with the market.
Yet this can (and primarily is) done with the actual funds there are.
What need is there for margin (and shorts), in a digital market (as this), that is beneficial to the market - that would not be occurring otherwise.
(yes, I see what you say about assisting price finding, but this happens regardless, with margin, it creates extra liquidity, but margin traders must gamble on volatility, the more volatility the profit)
I guess my main point/question is that price finding can be made without the need for margin (as it was before), and that margin and shorts add nothing to market that is beneficial, only extra (localized) liquidity and extra volatility (through hype, or trading, for their own profit).
One thing I guess that I can see, is that it allows more traders into the market (unfortunately normally bearish), which technically 'should' assist adoption (if they were not so bearish and trying to drive the market down).
Anyway, thanks again for your answer/time, I still see it as only beneficial for the individualistic need, and that the price finding market would work regardless (as it has).

What this person said.
Bitcoin is the application of this form of blockchain tech, which has come about as a form of currency.
It is primarily a method for transferring 'wealth' within a secure and trust-less environment, whether that 'wealth' is a type of money, contract, obligation, message, etc, is the application of that tech.

An interesting read (for those that can be bothered) is studying the Roman Empire, in particular, the fall of the Roman Empire, the hows and whys.
Ultimately it was down to the ability to inflate (and abuse) their monetary system for their military expansions which led to the destruction of their economy, the poverty of their civilians and collapse of their empire.
Sound familiar? It should.
@_date: 2014-10-09 15:00:18
It got more 'destructive' I would say, with margin trading. It inflates the (localized) market beyond what it really is and gives rise to excessive arbitrage (which would normally balance out the market value, but thanks to margin trading in such a small liquid market its creating extra fluctuations that are mostly caused by people trying to 'game' the market (short sales).
When people collude to try to bring value down for their own profit (or to harpoon a whale), then a margin trading exchange is their best friend (and not good for bitcoin).

Not really, as if value starts to fall drastically then he can always convert some to fiat and there are many more exchanges to do this now, so value drop on 1 exchange doesn't mean as much as it did last year, and it will mean even less next year.

The global blackmarket is roughly $475 billion (last time I checked), making SR roughly 0.25% (by your estimates), though of the global black market (which is also very likely undervalued, as its obviously a hard target to track).
And considering how much bullshit has come out from the FBI with regards to this case (and how obviously biased they are) - **I don't trust your FBI source!**
Meaning that the annual trade on SR is probably far lower, likely closer to what Forbes stated (from a neutral research perspective) which at the time was $35-$45 million.
If the FBI said that 99.9% trade of bitcoin was through SR, would you believe that too?

It's pretty clever if you think about it. It allows for a good way for fiat to flow into bitcoin/cryptocurrency, and not a route back for bitcoin.
And if you're willing to wait however long it takes to sell GBTC shares and transfer fiat to exchanges to buy btc, with a large enough spread its relatively worth it.
And those people buying shares off you will do the same with selling them higher, until they exit and buy bitcoin at a cheaper value (as it is the most logical exit with profit).

The relationship is slightly different. Dollars could go down, but that capital flight could be going to another fiat currency and bitcoin value would remain the same.
Gold, Fiat, Bitcoin, all belong to the Money sector. IF the totality of fiat went down, then one would expect either gold or bitcoin to go up.
With recently developments (gold straight to bitcoin), gold value could go down giving rise to bitcoin value whilst fiat denominations would remain the same. But yes, the possibility that USD is going down because USD is flowing into bitcoin does exist, but there are many factors and this is only one.
Its a three tiered system now.
But this is just a simplistic view and market manipulation does occur (especially in the fiat sector, see recent Forex scandals).

Please feel free to tell us of any item or service that has gone **up** in value/costs, and that this **up** in value has nothing to do with inflation, that this item/service would have gone up in value even in a static economy, or in a deflationary economy.
I see plenty of this around me in this time period that is constantly up in costs/value due to inflation.
And plenty of things becoming cheaper and more affordable due to deflation, even those these are fighting against the tide of inflation, the natural deflationary attributes of an economy combats against this.

You lack a full understanding of what fungibility means in a 'money'. 
Yes it is the things you linked, but it is also the ability to remain indistinguishable from other types of its monetary type.
E.g. my $20 should be just as valuable and useful as your $20. When you start stating "no, your $20 is worth nothing because it was once used for sniffing coke, and my $20 is worth $20 because it hasn't been used in/for any illegal purposes.
When you start changing what your $20 is worth compared to my $20 (e.g. nothing, and I'm going to arrest it!), then you are fucking with fungibility.

I suggest re-reading the information in the link you provided in one of your earlier comments - 
I also gave you a hopefully more detailed explanation in another reply, copied below;
When the unit of good is **NOT** equivalent to another unit of the same good of the same quality at the same time and place = **Not** fungible.
Elaboration - IF the Amtrak passenger had the SAME amount of USD on a debit card, AND that same debit card was on his person, OR had bank statements on him indicating that he has the SAME amount of USD in his bank account - THEN the DEA would not have demanded/taken the USD from him.
This equals the USD (fiat) in his bank is more valuable than USD (fiat) held on his person.
Therefore - The unit of the good (USD) is NOT equivalent to another unit of the same good of the same quality at the same time and place.

When people such as yourself (with your type of attitude towards this technology) realise more about the tech then the amount of people that you persuade just by accepting it yourself is FAR greater than the amount someone who is already pro-bitcoin would bring over. And it gives everyone else more time to acquire more bitcoin while you're doing the anti-bitcoin work for us, so, thanks, its appreciated :)
And the ironic thing is, when you finally come over to bitcoin, you will eventually reach the stage many others are at - let the anti-bitcoiners get on with it, more for us and everyone realises eventually, because we were ALL anti-bitcoiners at the start -

We are just discussing what the term **fungibility** means in a monetary sense.
It is a question of 'it means **this**' it does not mean **that**
Whether or not that makes cryptocurrency superior is a different question. What should be the next question after the fungibility of fiat is whether or not fiat should be considered **money**, seeing as it no longer holds 2 out of 3 of the required attributes to be considered money (well, in the USA anyway).

Cameron is a tool/puppet of the City of London, which is run by a select council that owns/runs The Crown corporation which is mostly owned by Nathan Rothschild (this is mostly done through a chain of subsidiaries and majority shares). 
The UK is also run partly by the House of Lords who get their seats through hereditary means (not democracy). Certain members of the House of Lords have vast interests in resources across the world and some also sit on the council that runs the City of London (which by the way has its own laws and is not part of London proper).
Any law in the UK goes through the House of Lords to be vetted. You should also check the right of the UK monarchy (which is run by the Crown Corporation) to take back the US in times of utter turmoil (civil war). The US never won its war of independence, the burning down of the Whitehouse should be your 1st clue.
Most people in the UK have no idea about the House of Lords or what it does.
If Cameron is publicly stating this now you can bet your balls that the powers that be already have plans, he is just a puppet and gets told what to say.

Just to reinforce what you are saying.
Cryptocurrency (bitcoin) is about freeing up the wealth of the world (of people) to the majority of people. Rather than combining wealth to be selectively used by a chosen (or not chosen) few.
Fiat had its heyday, it definitely had good merits, obviously more so than the system used before it.
But .. evolution.

Ok, first of all, I'm impressed you took the time for the long (and decent) reply.
Over the years I have noticed very few accountants drawn towards bitcoin or cryptocurrency, who has been attracted has happened in waves of types of people. Maybe more accountants along with governments will occur this year?
Anyway - I agree with you (and I am, for a variety of reasons, very pro-bitcoin). It can not be used in its current form as an acceptable/legal and practical form accounting in contemporary day.
When more professional enter this space and offer their thoughts and opinions then people will work on that angle more. There are a variety of ways this could be introduced.


You could create 3rd party platforms that incorporate current requirements that implements a payment system which ties in the extra information to the transaction ID.


You can do it with OPRETURN. You can add information onto a transaction that would be visible to the sender/recipient. This could exist in as part of the block chain. What information would you like to add? Businesses already confirm a lot of bills in emails, all this information can be added in bitcoin or alternative block chain.


What externalities? Specifics please, what are your thoughts on this?


I do not think its good enough. As you say, there needs to be more there. Or the law needs to change to accommodate only a transaction ID. But as you say, just an ID might not be enough for a lot of things.


You're looking at the now, and in this I agree with you. It is not very useful as an accounting tool. But it can be built upon. I know that the internet in 1995 was not useful for a lot of things either. Can you imagine Facebook, Youtube, or even Reddit on the 1995 version?
Look at the potential. If you had in your hand a digital book whose front end could be shaped and molded any way you wanted for your accounting purposes. And it would contain an unalterable history of events from its emergence.
How would you make the current accounting processes easier if you had a tool like that to work from?
If you could tie in a business or person's name, or an image of the received goods with each transaction. You could include a signed signature (image) into the transaction. Did you know that digital signatures are legally accepted in some countries? How do people confirm they have received email bills today? How would you?
But this record, if it's worked into the block chain, or an alt chain, would be a record of the accounting history of the world. For as long they used it. A unchangeable record for a very long time. And it is publicly available, and very transparent. What would you do with that digital book in your hand, for the purposes of pushing accountancy to new heights, how would you approach it?

The issues/incident of MtGox rose the price to (at the time) overvalued amounts.
By this I mean that you should consider the amount of users, businesses, and mining power involved at the time (end of 2013/beginning of 2014).
It was distorted (as some assume) because Karpeles was trying to game the market and make himself extra money to cover his losses, and/or that there were hackers (internal or external) that were crediting themselves extra funds on the MtGox platform.
It is interesting to compare -  - with - 
Notably, from November 2013 onwards, it seems to correspond (the assumption is, miners need to 'cash out' (convert to fiat) to pay for expenses).
There is also the amount of fiat flowing into altcoins (which I don't watch too much), which previously would have only flowed into bitcoin.
Personally, I think that at this time the relatively 'lower/current' value is good, whilst the infrastructure is still being built.
It is still rather difficult for the non-technical (and even for some technical people) to learn how to, and acquire, bitcoin.
2015 will be the 'year of Government', where we will see various shadow talks that have been occurring with governments world wide come to light.
What a lot of people do not realise is that most central banks hold their governments imprisoned, whether through buying off select politicians and/or creating specific laws/regulations that make them integral to their countries running, then dictating to said governments the terms.
Governments are very interested in alternatives at this time, the first few governments coming on board will happen this year.

I don't how to answer that .. IF something (let's say $16,000) is worth 0 (ZERO) in your pocket, and it is worth $16,000 in the bank (as it can be used far easier, because its 'safer' as you say). 
Then it is an individual choice as to whether 'safer' = more valuable, when not 'safer' = less value.


I knew you would say that, hence why I included **debit card** in my reply before. What's your answer to that? Police going to take your debit card if they see you have the funds in your bank (via bank statements you have on you, or that you tell them).
OR are they more likely to take the USD if you have it on your person?
P.s. Gold is not fungible.
Your issue is that you are either trolling or you are STUCK on a single understanding of fungibility. Fungibility means more than 1 thing, please read the link you provided fully.
Do you think having money in the bank is safer than not having money in the bank? Clearly you do, therefore you are arguing against yourself and not making sense. You **already agree** that cash on hand is **not** as safe as cash in the bank. 


If you do not think 'safe' = no value, then feel free to carry handfuls of USD where ever you walk (or whatever denomination your country has).

Difference being you have to rely on the banks honesty doing that (3rd party).
If you did it via the block chain then you don't have to rely on the 3rd party.
But you already know this.
And no, bitcoin protocol tech does not cover all aspects of accountancy **right now**.
Will it in the future? Probably not.
Will a 3rd party platform that allows you input and draw out relative information be created? Probably yes (if it has not been created already).
Will you then have to rely on the honesty of the 3rd party platform instead? Not if its based on open source software.

Things tend to centralize in contemporary day. We are heading bit by bit towards decentralization (in everything), decision making just is not there yet. Though it is very likely more decentralized forms of decision making (that are honest) will be created with block chain tech.
I think people are too ahead of themselves to expect decentralized everything at this time. And even when there is full decentralization some forms of centralization will remain. Why? Because not to be rude, but some people are morons, and a lot of people are not morons, but they are very easily led. With full decentralization needs to come better global education and a higher level of critical thinking.
I do not trust the majority of people in this time. Most happily follow politicians into wars started and continued with lies. Under an honest system, with the majority of people being involved, and the majority of these people being critical thinkers (able to think for themselves), then we will start to get there. Not there yet though, unfortunately.

Exactly, it has taken 6 years to be averaging under the 1mb as we are now, how many years to get 7x the amount more?
At that rate 36 years, but lets be reasonable and assume adoption steadily increases faster and faster and assume 3 years, by then we might get close 8mb blocks, then people can start worrying about 100gb storage to run a node. 100gb is really expensive and in 3 years time no one will be able to afford that /s
In that time do we think bandwidth availability and cost will improve? And will storage capacity and cost?
It seems most the assumption on the pro-1mb side argues that cost of bandwidth and storage will remain stagnant from now till forever, which is of course ridiculous.

Some people want to turn Bitcoin into a settlement system. This will occur with a 1mb limit as trusted 3rd parties (like blockstream) provide offchain solutions.
Others want Bitcoin to remain as a currency and payment system (without needing to trust a 3rd party), as it currently is, this can only occur if everyone can use the network and are not forced into using 3rd party people because the 1mb is full.
Which side wants to turn Bitcoin into something that it currently is not - and which side wants bitcoin to remain available for all without the need to go through a 3rd party trusted corporation.

Whereas I do normally agree with you, supply inflation = devaluation.. There is the argument that QE has not caused supply devaluation.
That it is in fact due to 'how' and 'where' created money is put to use. Though overall, I would sit in your camp if pushed, in that supply inflation does cause devaluation.
Is it only robbing value if the costs of living goes up? If deflation occurs on the commodity/goods/services level and QE is in existence.. what does this tell us?

It is definitely more secure than cash.
My strong suggestion is NOT to use a phone wallet app. Get a wallet on your home computer or laptop, and simply print out the QR code onto a laminated card (as previously mentioned). 
Don't get a tattoo as some people might suggest.. that's just daft. Until things have become more legal it is better than you change your address occasionally, and that is far easier to do if you simply print out a new QR code and laminate that.
If worse comes to worse and someone steals your card (with the qr code), or you lose it, there's absolutely nothing they can do with it.
Also IF you have to use a phone wallet, then use a throwaway for contact and leave your phone wallet at home. You can put an image of your QR code on the throwaway and thiefs will think you are storing your coins on there, the QR code can send the coins to your phone wallet at home, your desktop/laptop, and some decent wallet services/platforms provide a QR code that you can use.
Also .. paper wallet/cold storage .. look into these. Do not store all your coins on 1 device at home. Only small amounts, spending stuff, should be on your desktop/laptop, the rest you should send to your storage (for long term &amp; security). And again, laminate, and make multiple copies if you feel unsure.
And .. do not store it all on 1 paper wallet, spread it out a little, in case you lose 1 (or it gets damaged somehow). 0.5 bitcoin per wallet, or 1 per wallet, whatever you feel comfortable with.
bitcoin.org is one of the best informative sites.
Bitcoin is amazing, I am very pro-bitcoin, for a variety of reasons, but there are a LOT of scammers in the space at the moment, be aware of this.
And again, do feel free to ask questions at any time.

Pretty sure we did read the same post, but I copy/pasted his initial statement just in case, and I highlighted in bold (see above) for you to see.
1. He wants more transparency (from what I can see, most people at the Foundation have been wanting that for a while).
2. Olivier thinks the Foundation controls bitcoin (he has made this clear a few times, and he is wrong. How he got voted in as a Director under this misconception, I do not know).
3. He believes the Foundation is bankrupt (again, he is wrong, you can see from Patrick's posts on the forums, see links provided by Olivier).
So, wrong on two counts, especially about the control of bitcoin, which is kind of fundamental in my opinion, especially for someone in his position. If the Foundation was actually bankrupt, wouldn't they file for bankruptcy instead of continuing to pay some wages, hold DevCore London, etc? 
Though the Foundation does state that they have had money issues, and still do. Not quite the same as being bankrupt however.
And he wants to centralize core development .. how does that not concern you?

Actually, he could have been palestinian, seeing as he was born in the then Palestine, and his 'father' was not of any particular race. And since there is no given 'race' of Mary, the only hints was that it is more likely Mary and Joseph (extremely likely) spoke semetic which is closer to modern day Arab/Palestine.
So, just by the fact of where he was born and lack of hereditary 'race', apart from his links to the Arab world, speaks for itself.

Yes, there will always be hackers and scammers. Yet the implementation of the security measures that is in discussion is because of pull technology. The point is, there would **not** be any hackers or scammers in this type of theft as you can not 'pull' from a bitcoin address. It's just not how it works.


You are still thinking about the same type of prevention. Save the money from one type of security to only spend it on the same type of security is nonsensical.
The money could be spent on customer improvements, service, real features (not band-aids laundered as features). (Re) Opening smaller banks in new locations, donating to charity and humanitarian services would be my favourite.
Do you still think the security requirements are a feature on CC's? Can you describe what a feature is? Can you give an example of any CC that does not have the security features we are discussing?

Overall, I applaud the attempts and the efforts to bring this up and enact it.
If nothing else, it provides an opportunity for us (those that know) to explain how OSS and development works (for those that don't know).
It also highlights this particular issue. Ideally, large businesses should be hiring (or paying current) developers to spend a certain amount of their time on core code. 
This would keep developers spread around the world in a more decentralised fashion, and properly remunerate them for their time. Efforts to encourage businesses (that use or profit from bitcoin) to pay developers, either full or part time, should be encouraged.

It's called a 'counter argument', and considering what has already been posted by Olivier, I'm not sure if the drama could get any worse.
Also, he is very right. The Bitcoin Foundation is not Bitcoin. I don't know why anyone in a senior position as Director of the Bitcoin Foundation could think otherwise.
Bitcoin is open source, the Foundation simply gives wages to a very few of the core developers, how this equates to centralization and control of bitcoin is beyond my understanding.
Also, centralizing the majority core developers under one trust fund is FAR more centralizing and far easier for detractors to step on.
Surely it is visible, that having 90% (random number) of developers under 1 banner is more central than having 10% (again, random number).
NOTE: 90% and 10% are random numbers, the true numbers of contributors I do not know.
Maybe I am missing something?
Edit: Nullc has kindly provided a list below. How the few people contributing that are paid from the BF equal control, I do not know.
Now if **1** person had control of a trust fund that sponsored the majority of the developers, THAT is centralization. Think about it.

Greg is using a stalling tactic in the hopes that bitcoin gets stagnated with 1mb and blockstream and LN can take control. Then code does not need to go through core or github anymore, they can make changes by extension through blockstream and LN.

It wouldn't exist like that because that's not how it works. An alternative version might try to fill that niche, but bitcoin itself works on acceptance. If government tried forcing those changes then people (users) would not use it and it would be forked.
I think this is one of the base (misunderstood) fears of government using or approving block chain tech. That some people think they would successfully subvert the core, not realising that because of the way OSS works it would simply be forked and continue without any government alteration.
The other misunderstanding is that government is bank, or bank is government. In some cases/countries bank does have a majority control of government, but they never have full control, there are cracks in the facade and they are growing wider, remember that.

Centralized core development is basically having all the developers under 1 banner. IF this was to happen it would be far easier for the controller of that 1 banner (e.g. Olivier in this case, or the controllers of the trust fund), to call the shots.
Thankfully, due to OSS this would not work long, but it would definitely cause mayhem and probably crash the market as moves were made to control development.
Decentralization is a key element of what bitcoin is all about, what it is, why it exists, and what it was created against.
Some form of centralization is usually inevitable, but massive centralization like what is proposed should be avoided at all costs.
Maybe Olivier has good intentions, but this is what he is proposing. 
The Foundation needs a major slap, it could sink, it might not, but 
control of the funds for the majority of the developers is a very bad move and people should be **far** more concerned about this.
Edit: Pointing towards Olivier's post in reference to the trust fund -

Would not be needed if the fraud was not possible in the 1st place.
It's like ... introducing cars to the world, but stating "There are keys, but they're really crap, and can be copied easily, so your car is likely to be stolen." 
"BUT, we made this awesome feature that makes your car cost a lot more (also may increase tax for all), the feature hires security personnel to run around to all cars and check randomly if it's been stolen"
Why not just 'not' have the 'feature' in a system that was not susceptible to the same type of fraud? And spend that extra funds on other things.
In other words, it's **not** a feature, its a bandaid on a crap antiquated system not made for the digital age. A feature is not a 'must have' or bust. Do you think CC's and such could exist if they did not have this 'feature'?
IF the CC system can not exist without this 'feature', then the 'feature' (as you label it) is a core system of the whole.

For: buying mining pools - a lot of mining pools have xx power because of contribution from a lot of smaller actors. Buying a pool does not necessarily = you get that mining power, people can (and have done) shift their mining power somewhere else.
Buying mining machines - it would cost far more to buy enough mining machines to get 51% - this is a rough guess, judging that top UK politicians sell for 5k for a day, £1 million could get you a lot of politicians for that particular vote that you want accepted into law.
Estimated mining power last I checked (which was a while ago), was 600x a super computer (rough, old guess), which would cost far more than £1 million. Others can probably give a better guess on how much 51% of the current hash rate would cost.
And then there's the actual effect (assuming someone (bank/gov) did manage to secretly buyout 51% of the mining pools)  .. a 51% bitcoin attack doesn't actually **do** that much (reverse your own transaction, woot, and block some transactions), then people fork.
A 51% politician attack can have a very long lasting effect (and cost life's), prohibition, afghanistan, iraq, vietnam, TTIP, promoting banksters, lowering the legal (consent) sex age to something ludicrous, cutting sentences for pedophiles, etc (
And .. yes .. both sides (crypto and politicians) are susceptible to 'who has the most money', I'm very pro bitcoin, but I don't think it is a totally infallible system.
Just that its far more worthy of trust and use than our current system.

The insinuations from others I can't speak on. The financial conflict of interest for blockstream to have small blocks is pretty obvious, you see that one don't you?
I think blockstream devs definitely **do** care about bitcoin. But would prefer to keep the block size limited (that is pretty obvious).
Hence the conflict of interest. I'm not saying it to be nasty, I'm simply pointing it out.
Edit: I won't go on about it on because I will probably get banned.And let me repeat something I have said a few times. Blockstream is an amazing idea, I hope it all works as advertised. However, it can work with a larger blocksize, it just won't be as profitable.

That's kind of how reddit works ... perhaps the mods here would be inclined to move to a self run forum (e.g. bitcointalk) where there are no down/up votes


They are trying to call out to you with silent voices. When the downvoting stops its the sign that they have given up on you (and all you will be left with is the few hangers on and the bots.


You can call it whatever you wish, I am sure that various governments call legitimate protests 'tantrums' also. When you leave only 1 recourse to show dissatisfaction, then people *will* use that last recourse.


Everyone who has moved over to (and the other subs) would disagree with you. Do you believe they are acting spiteful and having a tantrum (no of course you don't). And to add, Theymos has explicitly stated that he is silencing the debate and knows what he's doing (I assumed you knew he had publicly stated this, its rather obvious from the previous sticky, and that's pretty much exactly what he has stated).


You are thinking "they silenced XT, but not the block size debate". What you are missing (and others are pointedly stopping) is that XT *is* the block size debate. It is extremely difficult (if not impossible, as has been shown), to discuss the block size without discussing how an implementation of larger blocks would exist (which brings us back to XT).
I could make 1 post that would fix the problems here, but it would be deleted, and I would probably be banned. If you do not see that as silencing the debate, well, I don't know how else to put it across..
My post would be titled - "Discuss larger blocks in or without the context of XT" - and you could have all the pros and cons laid out to bare, and make it a sticky. Yes it would get heated (and hence your moderation team), but heated discussion is fine, it shows peoples hearts are in it.
But unfortunately I fear it is too little too late (I hope you prove me wrong), the trust and faith in the control and mods here has been demolished.

What you see as manipulation, they see as disagreement. I've watched you for a long time (many years) BashCo, you know there are more experts out there than the handful of core (not commit access) developers.
And admittedly, I highly suspect a lot of people are downvoting things as a way to voice dissent against the censorship (what they see as they see as censorship).
You (not just you) have taken away their voice. You know you have, this is their only way to show their dissatisfaction.
Whereas before a majority of (relatively) decent posts were upvoted, they are now mostly downvoted. This is not brigading, this is the only way people can voice their dissent, for fear of banning and not being able to participate.
I am afraid that the dissenters see the 'toxic behaviour' as those who have taken away their voice.
(This is not just about XT, XT is just the product that sparked the debate, silencing the debate is what has caused the turmoil, and *you* know who the silencers are)

(has a failure rate does not = instantly fails, it = will always fail)
Ye... I don't think you understand what I mean, sometimes I have difficulty explaining things to individuals like yourself.
The fact that humans die really does not have anything to do with fiat systems. That you think it does... well, probably goes a way to explain why you have difficulty understanding the fallacy of fiat.
Try to separate humans from fiat, that's a good starting point. If you can not do that, then you might as well define your responses as "well.. the infinite is incalculable so therefore fiat will always exist."
It is an illogical comparison.
I am clearly not going to be able to explain simple history to you in a way that you will understand, this is why people say "google is your friend."
You can argue that the world is flat, that the sun is a cupcake, that fiat has never failed, and does not have a 100% failure rate.
It still does not change facts.

And to point out to anyone reading this, this is how a rational discussion can occur, people do NOT have to always agree. In fact, disagreement is essential to growth in almost every aspect, it fosters the need to clarify, simplify and discuss such matters so that the wider audience can understand.

Foundation of the discussion was, inflation causes loss of wealth.
You've already acceded to my side. In an earlier post you agreed that the USD has lost 98% of its value. And twice now you have agreed that this is due to inflation (by design or not, it does matter, and yes, I agree that it was by design), the case that inflation causes loss of wealth is agreed.
I rest my case.

Which part? In case you meant all of it. Check the history on, IMF, World Bank, City of London, Central Banks (nationally vs privately owned. For example, 'Bank of England', is a private bank owned by shares, owned by private individuals).
Also check legal status of the Vatican (if you did not know, the Vatican is counted as a 'City State', and has its own laws and is not part of Italy), check legal status of the City of London (also Washington DC falls under the same exemptions).
There is a lot of information out there, some crap. Most of the legit info comes from these places own website, they are telling people themselves, if people can just be bothered to read/research. It's an arrogance.
If you want to know a lot about what/why things are going on today, check your history, it has a lot of hidden information (really, not so hidden as much these days, just people can't be bothered to look).

There are more ways than 1 to conquer a country.


Sure, they only financed and armed Porshenko. Apart from that, nothing at all ;)


I don't watch Russian media, not much media at all these days. I do watch amateur and real life footage however, which mostly tells the story from the ground, and I draw my own conclusions (you should try the same, drawing your own conclusions from unbiased sources).
Ukraine was set to 'pop' after Syria failed to capitulate as fast as they wished. The set plan was derailed and now is alternative action set into play (e.g. destablize Ukraine). 'Funny' how Ukraine is on the border of Russia, would give the US a massive naval fleet ON Russia's doorstep, and would block Russia's access to huge trade and sea ports.
And that Greece never broke out into civil war (but doesn't have all these **coincidental** bonuses for the US).
You keep telling yourself whatever story you want to believe, most people do. But reality and causality will continue to happen regardless.

That seems more an attack on a company rather than a person. I understand that corporations are treated like people in many countries (legally also), but in all honesty, corporations are not people. In this we will just have to agree to disagree.
What confuses me more, is **why** people take it so personal when the conflict of interest is pointed out? Is it just to disparage and deflect the conflict of interest by trying to make out that it is a personal attack?
Conflicts of interests **do** exist in many cases, this won't be the last time in this phase space. In other spaces people (normally) acknowledge such conflicts and then work past them.
What has happened here is the constant denial, and even attacks (and assumed 'personal attacks'). That is a rather worrying attitude to take and is very defensive. Normally this means that the party that has the conflict is hiding something and deflecting.

Honestly, laughing my ass off, that you compare economic contemporary times with that is brilliant, seriously, what did they teach you in your degree?
And no I'm not advocating mercantilism (that's you trying to insinuate I am), what I'm trying to tell you (and I know its beyond you at this time), is that inflation is theft. It is theft of everything you do, at all times, even when you're sleeping, every cent you are worth is devalued and worth less every minute, every time they inflate the system.
*USD is still gold backed and the fed is 'government owned', and that the USD retains 100% of its value ;)*
That you actually think USD is gold backed, the fed is government owned, and that USD has retained 100% of its value shows how badly you are brainwashed.
Honestly, I used to think similar to you, then I woke up. You'll find your awakening also sometime.
p.s. Nixon moved the USD off gold in 1971. The fed is privately owned, and the USD has lost 98% of its value in the last 100 years.

The world is run by a few banks, all other banks are basically subsidiaries (they are owned (shares) and/or work through the big banks).
Most of the few big banks are HQ'd in the UK. Or specifically, HQ'd in the City of London, which has a different legal system than the UK and is basically a different country (think: Vatican).
There are 'friendly' smaller banks, but every time one opens its doors, the big banks come down with a hammer.
edit: The IMF and World Bank are simply US banks with 'big' names, both are privately owned and were created to give the 'international' feeling (the assumption they were approved internationally).

For the basic feeling of having 'more', even though they're of lesser value. Even after moving bitcoin displayed as 'bits', the psyche of someone (in this current/traditional economic frame of mind) is taught that 'whole' numbers to the left of the decimal have more value.


I'm still 50/50 on that. Would people prefer owning 10 Litecoins, or 100 mbtc? (conversion not accurate, I just put these numbers out there). I would probably say the btc, IF they were more Cryptocurrency savvy, but then they might not even know of Litecoin if they're not savvy..


Probably right. 
But, the market speaks for itself, Litecoin did gain value (and still retains some). Whether or not it will continue to be used, we'll have to wait and see.
And to add,


Could very well be. A hedge against bitcoin, sure. I'm sure there's other viable altcoins that are used to hedge (and arbitrage) against bitcoin. So in just that, it has value. Though I'd say if its only this, then its value is definitely tied to bitcoin (whereas some altcoins might be dependent upon their own merits).

One thing we can be sure on though, is that the number of users is always increasing (this can be verified by the reports from xx business now has xx customers, transaction activity, number of wallets on wallet providers, site visits (of various sites)), and probably a host of other things I can't think of right now.

You sir, are laughable. It is very obvious you are talking crap and keeping avoiding my simple questions, because you are either dumb (and have no degree), or are a shill (and still have no degree).
You avoid my questions because either you don't know (which is laughable if you have a degree in finance), or because you know answering them show how wrong and stupid you have been this entire conversation.
I never thought you had a degree in the 1st place, its a common shill/troll tactic here "I have a degree in finance, so everything I say is correct and everything you say is wrong."

Are you requesting the info from me? Do you think I am the government?
But here you go, since you think I am THE government (which one I'm not sure).
OP is correct, in under 5 years there will be global hyperinflation not focused on any country, but the world. The USD will go first, as enough jobless hungry people finally have enough of the shit system forced on them. Over the course of the following 6 years (up to 2026) the east will take over, China in particular, as Russia spends a lot of its resources battling of the US who have kept trying to hack at its edges.
After 2026, things will cool down again, the US will start to pick itself back up, but it loses its global imperial power by then. And there is finally peace in the middle east as China moves in its own forces, 'encouraging' the west to move out.
You think this is all a bit crazy, but over the years you will think back to this many times and it will play on your mind. And you will hate yourself for not seeing it sooner and for being part of the problem, but by then it will be too late.
