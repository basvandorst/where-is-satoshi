The core concept of Bitcoin is nice too but people are really missing the importance of the memes.

You never know those holiday flights are volatile. Hard to time the correction ;)

Lmao. South Korea is a gated community. I lived in Seoul a few years and have visited the DMV. You've made my day.

Maybe the person can farm the IPs of people trying to figure out larger amounts and make them targets. I'm not an expert tho.

I've had a trip planned that I was gonna cash out some btc for. Now I'm gonna hodl cuz who knows what two weeks in December will bring. I'm still going on the trip, just going to be more frugal about it!

He's definitely bright, it's just a different color than you are used to. (Brown)

TP is literally the fiat cash of asshole cleansing. It's 2018 guys, bidet x wetwipe up you animals.

Too real for me. I used to do export compliance stuff. I wonder if the Cuban flag emoji would trigger it.
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:32:27
Tosh mentioned bitcoin on his recent episode too. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 02:14:58
Well I hope it doesn't come to it but if you do end up on dialysis make sure to mod in a bitcoin price live counter into it for the karma. I kid... Best of luck with your surgery!
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:42:28
Fuckin' thank you.

Slow is a relative term...

I saw this headline from forbes on my Google feed. I figured it was a contributor but others might not.
@_date: 2017-11-22 06:24:09
When did you pay it off?
@_date: 2017-11-22 06:57:45
How you holding up?

If you do it id wait til Asian markets open tonight. If it gets another kick I'd hodl strong rn. *Not a professional opinion*

Holy shit dude. As an American that has to fend financially for the healthcare of myself and my loved ones, I am so happy for you. Health is priceless, but 9 btc is a damn good deal. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:49:03
Your understanding is incorrect. The issue is with transaction fees and scaling to keep the fees low. Big money is already here. This subreddit didn't scrounge up 100 billion dollars.

You sure are! The medicine behind transplants is pretty awe-inspiring these days. Mind if I ask what procedure?

Are core bitcoin devs really anti ethereum? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:59:46
Wholesome as fuck.
@_date: 2019-04-03 03:43:10
So was the other commenter. If you tell everyone without blind optimism to fuck off you'll end up in an echo chamber. I'm as excited as the next guy for bulls but I'm not making any life changing decisions over it.

This is an earnings call. I am listening but I don't think they will plan on unveiling anything about bitcoin as it's geared towards investors interested in AMZN growth. It could be mentioned towards the end if a question about strategy in the next quarter addresses the idea specifically but I wouldn't count on it since they will probably want to announce it elsewhere. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 08:35:08
I've been watching the obvious shills come out all night wondering where they are coming from. Thanks for the info!

I know JP Morgan recently made statements about using Blockchain and the CEO has had choice words but is there evidence of them doing anything more nefarious with BTC transactions? I just used them to purchase. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:32:27
I left to walk my dog a few minutes after I posted. Nothing?
@_date: 2017-10-24 07:24:24
You are influencing the market! In a very small, nearly indistinguishable way. Keep it up though!
@_date: 2017-10-24 06:57:52
Yeah, it's a factor. I don't think it's played that large of a role though. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 21:52:26
Because there would be a new anarchist billionaire in venture capitalism. That'd be pretty rad. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 09:31:40
Bitcoin will increase as long as the demand increases. Not even sure what this guy is talking about. It's kind of mind boggling that someone would make this assumption after this years trends. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 09:45:52
True. There are people confidently spreading misinformation on new threads all the time here lately so I just try and be a voice of reason when I can.
@_date: 2017-10-23 05:09:28

Only communism works in space

You can try. Typically its 3-5 business days for ACH transfer. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 09:54:09
It can take up to 24 hours. Coinbase might be gettin' swamped right now. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:23:42
Because you are asking a support representative a PR question. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 10:16:29
damn fool, chill
@_date: 2017-10-24 06:51:42
I was about to say that. How would banks pay back their loans and fines for fraud? /s
@_date: 2017-10-24 06:26:28
100k is only one millionth of the current market cap so it wouldn't be a notable difference. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 08:06:04
Still at it?
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:56:00
Try the side bar/FAQ. 
I'm not well vested into bitcoin but I'm personally in it for the long term investment and to support the future of decentralized currency.

Your post history is a good read. Why are you doing this?
