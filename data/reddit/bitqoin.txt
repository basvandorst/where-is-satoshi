Ég er því miður ekki með yfirlit yfir kredit kortið mitt þannig að ég er mjög forvitinn um auka gjöld sem bætast við svona kaup.
Gætirðu sagt mér hvað þetta kostaði þig í krónum miðað við kredit korts yfirlitið þitt?

I used my Icelandic Mastercard 2 days ago without any issues. Was going to buy some more yesterday but that's when this error started popping up. 
I tried contacting their support but I'm still waiting for a reply 24h later. :(

Do they reply slower to international/european customers? I'm still waiting after 24 hours.

Takk. Það virðist ekki mikið bætast við færsluna. Ég bjóst við fleiri hundruð kr í gjöld.
Ætli það sé svipað gengi/gjöld ef maður leggur inn á kortið sitt af Circle?

Good luck using it.

[Apparently twice as much as Bitcoin network when this article was written.](
It is? The miners themselves might get a few satoshis/bitcoins, but what else?
"No, it wouldn't be beneficial" or "no, it's not possible" or both?

I'm very curious to know that as well. And yes, I did think about that. However that data is a bit harder to find.

I was mainly curious due to the possibility of a double spend attack. Can you do that on the stock market? Surely, it's a bit harder.

I got that message as well.
I decided to ignore that crap and add my card anyway, it worked. I'm from Iceland with a Icelandic mastercard pre-paid creditcard.

They accepted my Icelandic pre-paid mastercard credit card. Beautiful. Also interesting since Iceland has capital control applied to it's currency for now. I think buying bitoins might be illegal here.
I'm not sure if I can deposit from Circle to my CC though.

Ah, Interesting. Thanks for the reply.

Shit. I've been waiting for 5 days for a admin to answer my "password retrieval support ticket". 
I had small amount invested since months ago but unfortunately forgot my password and the site for some (dumb) reason doesn't allow automatic password retrieval.
I guess they won't be giving me my retrieval email after this mess.. sons of bitches.

I agree with you. 
I don't think the fact that banks are wasting some electricity justifies anything. I do think though that most data centers are more energy efficient than most hardware used for mining bitcoins.

There is a reason more and more countries (At least in Europe) don't use cheques. Where I live they were common in the '90s, non-existent now.
