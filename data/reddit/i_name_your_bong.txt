I had read the Paul Ryan tweet first and then his crypto tweet right after and I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, these are not words Trump knows.

Read his crypto tweet, and then read his tweet about Paul Ryan.  They read totally different, but both are attacks.

That's true. So you think it was more a dig at Facebook and their coin and then just rolled Bitcoin and all crypto in?

A few things, trump tweets about shit all the time and literally nothing happens. The big thing from this is that tweet was in no way shape or form written by Donald J Trump. The word choice was very different, it's pacing was different, no parentheses or capital letters, so then the question is, who wrote it? Hours before that tweet trump held a social media summit, which Facebook and Twitter were no invited, so someone crafted that tweet and for a reason. Bitcoin is in no more or less danger than before this tweet, if anything it will have people searching and researching and possibly buying. The fed chair compared crypto to gold today. Our Bitcoins are fine...for now.

I wish...0.1 of a bitcoin. I started research on Sunday, and by the time I was ready to buy today, the price had already gone up 10%!

That is how I spend every weekend actually, how did you know?! I'm hoping the BTC helps pay for the medical and legal expenses.

I used coinbase, it has an app or you can do it from your computer. It was easy, just add a bank account or a debit card. And yes, you can buy as little or as much as you want.
