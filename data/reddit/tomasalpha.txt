Try using a back up wallet if you have one, or recover the wallet with your seed
@_date: 2016-06-23 00:17:46
I'm gonna delete it now, thank you
@_date: 2016-06-23 00:18:25

@_date: 2016-06-24 19:43:55

@_date: 2016-06-22 23:49:39

I was scared shitless
@_date: 2017-01-04 20:35:55

@_date: 2017-08-05 02:54:04
You really need a crew?
@_date: 2017-04-13 08:46:15
I think he doesn't mean the bitcoin mining mafia, I think he means all those people selling after his tweets
@_date: 2017-04-15 05:52:32
Second one
@_date: 2017-09-08 20:13:03
Can you translate it please? the zerohedge google transaltion is really bad
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:09:49

@_date: 2017-09-24 18:46:52
Thank you
@_date: 2017-09-08 20:11:13
Can anybody provide with a real translation, not that zerohedge google transalte crap?
@_date: 2017-10-06 17:30:03
Hey! why don't you stop *eating* and buy BTC with all that money? Maybe you will buy the whole supermarket with that in the future!
Isn't that a *great* idea.
@_date: 2017-05-16 00:13:53
This iw hi I think this is an attack on BTC more than anything else, 
@_date: 2017-05-16 00:12:55
Can I get my payment in USD and widthdraw it in bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-05-31 18:31:53
Affected, affected, affected, affected. Geez
@_date: 2017-05-31 18:35:58
If she had I wouldn't know how to spell
(Always the mom joke, the internet has made some people stupid. Or maybe they are already were so, and I just didn't have much contact with their kind)
@_date: 2017-05-16 02:22:18
Thank you, been looking for something like this for a long time
@_date: 2017-05-31 22:49:54
Me, I just wrote one word which was off topic, and from which he could've learnt something (I even bet he did). You wrote 130 off topic words, insulting me for one. If you cared about sucking other people's time you would have kept quiet.
Edit: Well, you made me laugh so that's something
@_date: 2017-05-27 17:53:00
Ohh, everyone knows the future here...
I'm so glad I dropped by
@_date: 2017-07-05 12:44:34
How did *you* know?
@_date: 2017-07-26 16:57:46
Maybe the money will be given back to customers, since this is not a hack. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 03:12:02
Yeah, I guess you're right. Depends on how much you had there
@_date: 2017-07-05 15:00:07
No, it happened to me and if i had a tracking number i would have been safe and paypal would have taken the loss.
It doesn't matter if it was a blank envelope.
@_date: 2017-07-29 03:11:20
Yep. Like those responsible for the 2008 crisis. All in jail, right?
@_date: 2017-07-29 03:12:21
Well, that's something
@_date: 2017-06-15 03:17:49
They scammed me and not let me widthdraw my funds
@_date: 2017-06-30 04:10:39
I hope there are no more queries?
Yes, I think it's fake
@_date: 2017-06-15 03:17:59
They scammed me and not let me widthdraw my funds
@_date: 2017-06-19 23:32:01
So you think all these people are lying ?
is it a conspiracy?
what kind of evidence do you want? 
If I am barking at the wrong tree then why do you want evidence?
And how do I contact reddit?¡
@_date: 2017-06-26 14:42:29
@_date: 2017-06-19 22:46:03
Oh, yeah. Countless times.
The chat support says they are not available to business customers (??? imagine that, a business customer is less valued than a personal one)
Their email answer is always the same automatic reply
@_date: 2017-06-15 03:24:12
Payza is a scam, don't ever use them
@_date: 2017-06-20 18:44:00
I contacted him, now my funds are not on hold anymore and I have to start the widthdraw process over again, which takes 3-5 days.
I hope I get my money soon.
@_date: 2017-06-20 02:35:10
btc-e? are you sure?
@_date: 2017-06-15 03:22:16
You scammed me and not let me widthdraw my funds.
Why is money still on hold?
you are scammers
my client already contacted payza and said she is happy with my services
so why is my money still on hold
@_date: 2017-06-21 19:40:41
You have not sorted out this for me at all. I still don't have the funds.
I waited a 6 day period before my funds got put on hold. They were released from being on hold but not released to my bitcoin wallet. I have to start the widthdrawal process again instead of releasing the funds to my bitcoin wallet given that the waiting period was already done before.
it has not been sorted out at all
@_date: 2017-06-26 02:30:42
Where is the mining farm? somewhere in the picture?
@_date: 2017-06-20 18:53:48
Yeah, I know, it is inadmissible that I have to go through this and create a reddit post.
I contacted support like 7 times before.
I still don't ahve the money thjough, I don't know why they make me go through the widthdrawal process again, I already had done it before. They should have just released them. Now I think it's something fishy again
@_date: 2017-06-20 13:40:54
Can you provide any source of the btc-e part? 
I've had an account with them for *years* and never had any problem.
I find it hard to believe
@_date: 2017-06-02 17:48:00
This is from when bitcoin was $1400
@_date: 2017-06-21 14:29:09
Yeah, like they are the only ones doing that...
@_date: 2017-06-05 16:03:25
Justin Bieber eats cheese? OMG
