sorry but a lot of people warned of that problem for years.... nothing happened suddenly. 
even satoshi himself said, that a simple blocksize increase can fix that problem

I'm running Bitcoin Core as a Full Node for several months now and it already destroyed 3 hard disks because of the permanent load and stress
maybe I should switch to SSDs :/

little mistake here:
Wie ermittelt ihr euren Verkaufskurs?
Den Preis den ihr zahlt, wenn ihr bei Coinimal Cryptocoins kauft, wird aus verschiedenen Faktoren emittelt. Es gibt meist mehrere verschiedene **Markpreise** und wir probieren euch einen sehr fairen Durchschnittpreis anzubieten, auf welchen wir unsere Gebühren aufschlagen.

Is there a real difference in memory usage between *bitcoind* and *bitcoin-qt* ?
@_date: 2015-01-03 01:03:09
it's a virtual machine .. just don't use it as a wallet.
the trojan would have to be very intelligent to spread over the network and search for bitcoins to steal
very unlikely
@_date: 2015-01-03 01:06:19
what do you mean?
It runs Bitcoin v0.9.3 
I think if the ISP assigns a new IP you need to restart your bitcoin software
maybe there is a solution in v0.10.0 ?
@_date: 2015-01-02 20:04:02
if someone wants to setup a **ready2run full node** in a virtualbox:
just download the whole lubuntu virtualbox harddisk and run it on your computer in your virtualbox!

Can I use the latest master version too ? (0.10.99)
@_date: 2015-01-15 02:24:53
you need ASICs (special bitcoin mining hardware)
you also need to calculate profitability: 
**short answer: DON'T MINE BITCOIN !**
it's not profitable! just buy some bitcoins directly! especially at the low prices today ! ;)
@_date: 2015-01-14 00:39:44
After make there are no .exe files in /src/ .. :(
Also I used ` ./configure --prefix=/depends/x86_64-w64-mingw32`
because with ``pwd``
it doesnt work!
@_date: 2015-01-12 14:57:19
do I have to replace x86_64 with i386 at ./configure AND at make HOST= ..
both? or only at ./configure if I want to build 32-bit..

a virus that copies itself to a pen drive, then steals the private key from the offline PC and back on the online PC the virus sends it over the internet?
even if this virus exist, it's unlikely that I get this kind of virus on the online pc..
So, no I'm not really afraid.

@_date: 2013-04-09 19:12:48
you can always buy .. next week probably 300$/BTC :)
@_date: 2013-05-31 21:21:26
You can also become a bitcoin node with bitcoin-qt or bitcoind.
That would help the network.
@_date: 2017-06-12 09:51:23
a miner would never stall Bitcoin's development for years because it would drive usefulness to the ground. 
a miner would never destroy the basis of his profits.
furthermore 80% of the miners including Jihan agreed on segwit + 2mb increase.
the only who can't compromise are core/blockstream developers.
even with segwit and lightning .. 1mb blocks are insufficient.
we have 10 or 20 Terabyte harddisks.. 2mb blocks are not a problem for anyone in 2017.
