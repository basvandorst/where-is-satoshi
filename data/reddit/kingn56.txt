It's happening to me right now, I have a high TX fee and not gone through. But if you look on blockchain the last 6 blocks sizes are 	998.16kb meaning they are full, hopefully it settles down soon.
@_date: 2016-08-08 21:57:37
Maybe contact blockchain and see what they know, it's worth a shot. And yes, I had many btc when they were 20$ each but sold them all before the price spike. I feel your pain.

Did you give them a specific address to send it to? If so go to  and in the top right search box type the address you wanted them to send it to, if their is any unconfirmed transactions it will show them, will also show your balance. If you see no transactions it means they have not sent it yet.

If you have a computer with no internet just take all the electrum files from a pc that does have internet, open the program on the computer without internet and create a new wallet, send to that new wallets address. Only EVER bring that wallet/computer online if/when necessary
@_date: 2016-08-30 04:42:52
Electrum does not delete your old address's. Did you create an entirely new wallet? If not then you should have the bitcoin, or they sent it to the wrong place/are lying?
Does the wallet have connections and is synced properly?
Is the transaction they sent confirmed on the blockchain.
@_date: 2016-08-07 01:56:49
? You do realise a decent percentage of their userbase simply uses the site for crypto to crypto trading meaning their is no point and you should not need to become verified, all the bit-license will do is make them lose users.

Such as Unobtanium, Dotcoin, Netcoin, Tao.Network. Etc.

It's because the blocks are full right now, and the TX fee wasn't high enough. Give it some time. I'm waiting as-well.

Not at all, the site wasn't hacked in the sense that passwords and data was revealed, it was more to do with manipulating private keys, Also even if the site was hacked information like that is encrypted and extremely hard for hackers to decrypt. Stop being paranoid, you are fine.
@_date: 2016-08-07 01:59:08
go to the homepage of blockchain.info and paste his address into the top right search thingy, it will show all transactions going to and coming from his address, it should show yours as unconfirmed or confirmed, if not possibly you sent it to the wrong address?
The only other possibility would be the TX fee was too low, in which case you would search your own address or look in your wallet and see what it says
@_date: 2016-08-03 14:51:41
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:09:38
Fuck no I would not give it back ,I had nothing to do with the hack, if something is sent to me as a gift i'll keep it. Besides anyone who keeps that amount of money in an exchange 1. Has lots of food on their table and 2. Is a bit of an idiot.

@_date: 2017-02-23 01:47:01
I have to disagree with you, maybe one out of 20 transactions i make does not show on blockchain.info and after it's confirmed it certainly does. Not only that but a few weeks ago i asked them to show the Fee and they have added that as-well, they are a great site with a recently upgraded gui that looks fantastic. Why hate on something that is provided to you for free as a convenience, get a life idiot.
@_date: 2017-02-23 18:05:24
Yea, i contacted them but sadly they use bitgo and have no control over fees. Although they did mention they are pressuring them to change that. :/
I guess i just got extremely unlucky as viabtc has not had a block in a long time. :P
Was not sure if any other places offered similar services so i could try and speed it up.

Yep, I just find it strange as bitcoin is not something that is limited to a 5 day market or takes weeks to transfer between country's, it is fast and arbitrage should only take a few minutes if that which makes me wonder what kind of scheme is going on.
@_date: 2017-01-05 05:45:51
Yes but if the police had not randomly decided to go their in the first place the confrontation NEVER would of taken place. I guarantee he was not a threat to anybody or had any plans to commit any violent acts. That fact of the matter is many police related shootings are caused by the police creating confrontation.

Yes, generally you deposit to the paper wallet then if you want to spend it you import it into a wallet like Electrum and if for some reason you want to put those coins back on a paperwallet you'd create a new one. you could technically send the btc from the change address back to the paperwallet address but then it is not secure as it has been "online'

I guess my main question though is just how the price on the american exchanges does not reflect this surge in purchasing from china, With bitcoin being transferable 24/7 and practically *instant* why are coins not being taken off the american exchanges and sent to the Chinese ones at a high rate that would create price parity?

Nope. He's right amount of BTC sent does not dictate tx size.
For example if you send .10BTC from 10 different change address's in your wallet the fee will be higher then one address sending 10btc.

And what does the queen have to do with anything? No one in canada gives a fuck about the queen.
@_date: 2017-01-05 23:41:22
Really depends on what your objective is, if you believe in what bitcoin holds for the future and have enough money that you can spend 10K and leave it sitting around for years without worrying about it letting bitcoin hit its highs and lows until it eventually takes off huge or fails, then buying now is fine.
If you don't have a lot of money and are looking to make a quick profit off of what you do have Then this would be considered a fairly risky investment, Sure you certainly won't lose everything but you could lose a lot or gain a lot.
I guess it depends on how much money you have and whether or not that 10k-15k is negligible to you.
@_date: 2017-01-04 23:27:15

@_date: 2017-01-06 05:28:59
Well, I work based on evidence and based on the current evidence at our disposal we can assume the number is closer to 400K then it is to 50K.
Until someone can find a way to provide more accurate information we have to go with what we have, you can hypothetically assume that one person own thousands of those address's or create conspiracy stating that the 400K address's are all owned by one person but based on EVIDENCE the number is 401765 and that's the end of the discussion.
@_date: 2017-01-06 05:23:11

Most exchanges move the coins sent to your address into cold storage or into a address that hold a large amount of coins, Checking a specific address is really only helpful if it is your own wallet or paper wallet.

Unless you are withdrawing/depositing serious amounts of money don't worry about taxes.
A few hudnred here and their won't hurt. But if you have your own bank account depending on whre you live some exchanges allow you to withdraw money without being verified, like in canada for example.

Overall they just do not have a good reputation, many users have had their coins stolen by the support team, It sometimes takes them 2 weeks to a month just to update a coin while it sits in maintenance.
They have sketchy site security to say the least and it's only a matter of time before they get hacked
The site is full of pump and dumpers, trolls and shitcoins, just look at the chat. lol

Even if china was to impose capital controls on bitcoin, I don't think it would be bad for bitcoin, It would just mean that the government of china is basically acknowledging bitcoin is a real and serious currency and that they want a fair share of it under their control.
IMO it is bullish.

That tx id does not look to be from bitcoin, no record of it on the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-01-03 23:51:42
Whenever you send bitcoin the remainder goes to something called a change address, by default i think a wallet generates 100 of these that's why it is recommended to re-backup your wallet every time you get over like 60-70 transactions. as if you do over 100TXs and don't back it up that backup will only contain whatever bitcoin is in those 100 change address's.
You can always just send all the coins back to the original address but then you'd be paying a fee for no reason, Some wallets also offer an advanced coin control feature that makes that easier.

with bitcoin, you kind of have to get used to these types of situations, we get a lot of newcomers to bitcoin who have never ever traded on a market before in their life and are not aware of what to do when prices rise and crash, resulting in weak hands that knowledgeable traders will abuse to make a profit, good learning experiences though.

"Bitcoin has value today because traders speculate that it will become a transactional currency"
Wrong on so many levels.
"If you think bitcoin could be a store of value without use cases just because it has a 21 millions limit you are delusional my friend :)"
Have you ever heard of a commodity, A stock, Gold? Bitcoin can be a commodity without ever being a payment method, the fact that it works as both is a bonus.

Honestly, you should be fine using localbitcoins trusted buyers = paypal.
Me and many other people in know used paypal when we were underage and as long as you add your bank account which verifies your paypal you should be fine, just do small amounts like 100euro at a time, withdraw to bank and repeat.
It is really not hard to fake your age. :P
And also if you withdraw the money then someone charges back you could just abandon the paypal account.

Download one of the many wallets, Bitcoin Core, Electrum, MultiBIt. Send the coins to it, Make sure it is encrypted with a password, Back itup on USBs or other computer.

I would Agree with you On Factom but I'd also add Unobtanium, it provides me with a  good hedge against BTC, when BTC drops in price UNO goes up. It's More Related to the USD then To BTC and has extremely low supply that i use as a store of wealth.

Along with what i said earlier, it's evident we would obviously still need some nationwide rules and possibly a small small tax to implement them, such as one community can not harbour a fugitive from another simply because they don't like that communities decided punishment, it would probably also be beneficial if communities that are in close proximity to each other had to to help each other so when one falls on hard times the other 4-5 in the area can help resulting in no one ever being impoverished.

Did you ever think not everyone is involved in bitcoin purely as a speculator? some might just like bitcoin, some use it for buisness or merchant services? some use it for altcoins. You make it sound like speculation is all bitcoin is good for. I don't care what the price is.
not only that but it only took a week for the price to go back up and stabilize, bitcoin was on a spike at the time anyway.
@_date: 2016-10-17 18:11:33
It would be safer to assume that bitcoin is like the SWIFT payment Network and things Like Visa, mastercards and banks are similar to the exchanges. Meaning bitcoin itself does not need the TPS everyone says it does.

Kind of, You will know what address i sent btc to and how much i sent, but you will have no idea where i spent it or if it was sent to a specific exchange, as everyone has their own address's on exchanges and most websites give you a single use address for when you buy something.
So in essence people really don't ever know "how" you spent your bitcoin the most they can do is know how much you spent.
@_date: 2016-10-17 22:04:21

You and the other idiot who are suggesting china is dumping the bonds because "they need groceries" or are "In a state of economic collapse" are talking out your asses, what connection do you have to china? None, therefore anything you think you know is either a lie or from some american news outlet which has always published biased towards china.
The fact of the matter is china is becoming a stronger super power then america and much of the world is beginning to hate america.
The real reason they are selling the bonds is to make their currency stronger, buy precious metals, invest in infastructure across the globe, create new economic ties and destroy americas ability to have free reign over the world.
It has nothing to do with china "needing to buy groceries" or having serious problems. America is in just as bad shape as china economically.
Just face it, eventually america is going to have to start worrying about its own problems and leave the world alone, or face destruction.

has nothing to do with the company/exchange has to do with blockchain, like with any mathematical problems, sometimes they can take a while to solve.

It actually does offer them security, alot of people steal bank accounts and credit cards then the payment gets charged back, so yes it's necessary if you want your bitcoin company to remain solvent.
And if you are suggesting any government/serious hacker can't already get your information you have been mislead. it is easy.
If you are not willing to give a license then you don;t deserve to be able to trade a lot of bitcoin through exchanges.

For many of us a drop in price just allows us to accumulate more faster, which is great. So by all means, more exchanges please get hacked. lol

Investment: "the action or process of investing money for profit or material result"

The point i was trying to get Across to you is not every one HOLDS bitcoin, Besides any investor knows you have not lost or gained anything until the moment you hit sell, ontop of that it is the SPECULATORS/STUPID Day Traders faults that the price crashed in the first place. I have no sympathy for them cause we don't need them, if you aren't using bitcoin to buy/sell stuff, Buy altcoins or Long term Hodl and not look at daily price You are a nuisance.
@_date: 2016-10-22 16:09:58
Actually it's a huge reason many get into bitcoin, tons of us have got scammed, charged back on paypal, charged back from fraudulent credit cards. Bitcoin provides us with an option in which we don't have to worry about that.
I'd say it's a huge reason the public DOES use bitcoin.
If we are referring to the population that does not know the difference between a url bar and a google search, it's quite obvious why they don't use bitcoin They are stupid and lack the ability to think critically.
@_date: 2016-10-20 21:47:14
The last couple of days we have had quite a few delayed blocks and the unconfirmed tx's is pretty backed up, i'd give it a couple more days, might be a good idea to contact them as-well.

Anyone who keeps a majority of their coins on an exchange is quite frankly, an idiot. This is a bad argument. Everyone who has been in crypto for any good amount of time knows that if you have a significant value in a coin you should at the very least have them in your own wallet, if not in a paper wallet or something like a trezor.
@_date: 2016-10-15 18:06:18
Hmm, Well some of them hang around on you could get in contact with them their.
I do know they generally do not work/respond to tickets on weekends or holidays but certainly do on weekdays. If you do ever become allowed to use their exchange though i would certainly recommend it.
They have no withdrawal fees for BTC which is a +. And although Instant E-transfer has a high fee, it is instant and amazing! For when you have the real urge to buy some coins instantly!
@_date: 2016-10-22 02:12:04

@_date: 2016-10-27 00:23:52
Once it is implemented on the clients, It needs 95% of mined blocks to support segwit for a certain number of blocks then it activates, i'm not sure you could ever correctly put that on a timeframe as nobody can really predict the future. Although their is a good chance viabtc could block it.
@_date: 2016-10-25 21:20:54
yep, would not suprise me. notice the relatively low amount of txs per block.

And if a community feels they don't need a new road, that would be their decision to make, Communities themselves could decide how to deal with thiefs, murderers, rapists. etc.. If the community wants to cut off their hands or kill them they can, if they want to rehabilitate them they can. Other communities should have no say in that.

Sure, but where are you going to get a large amount of cash that is not reported or in the system?
The government does not care about your 100$ to 2000$ petty purchase. But try spending more then 10k$ without it being reported or at least someone asking questions.

To argue their is no such thing as spam is extremely stupid.
If that's how you understand things I guess DDOS attacks are just people pinging a website millions of times and should be legal? 
Withdrawing and depositing the same 100$ 500 times into your bank account just to show a large amount of money transacted on your monthly bank statement is not spam? Go try it.
Paying someone in all pennies for a 500$ ticket instead of giving them 500$ in bills is normal?
I could go on and on and on. If a transaction serves no other purpose and is sent with the malicious intent of disrupting a network then yes it is SPAM.
@_date: 2016-10-23 21:32:07

Instead of a country wide tax system, what i would prefer to see is communities make these decisions themselves.
So instead of always collecting taxes I would prefer it work something like, Does the community need new roads? Lets have a meeting once a month and decide, hey! Let's all pitch in on it for the greater good of our community.
If nobody wants to then they don't get a new road, which is fine cause ultimately it would be their decision and i can respect that, but if a community wanted to attract new business and new residents they would certainly all be glad to pay a little bit to update things.
I would also prefer if this is how the legal system worked as-well, communities themselves decided how to punish people from their community.

You deleted your comment because you know you are wrong, need i say more? don't try and spin things now.
@_date: 2016-10-23 21:34:51
The fee you put is a bit low for the transaction size, give it time, I am 100% certain you will get them.
just refresh that page once and a while until it shows it is confirmed.
@_date: 2016-10-23 21:14:15
decreased, their is literally a website that does it for you. lol.
@_date: 2016-10-11 21:42:20
Many cryptocurrencies adjust difficulty next block, would not be hard to implement on BTC if this scenario was to take place.
@_date: 2016-10-27 23:44:02
well maybe you were raised to not have moral or a soul, but everyone around me, including me has a soul and would refuse to let that person neglect everyone else from getting their apples and running a monopoly. In fact i would be happy to see him killed. But to each their own, we don't agree on this and never will.
Obviously the capitalist elitist have an absurd amount of money they can spend to fill up block space and prove their "point" but that doesn't make it right.
@_date: 2016-10-21 17:11:52
you can't fix stupid, stop hurting his feelings! LOL.

Even as the Pro fork idiots spam the blockchain we still manage to be rising in price!
@_date: 2016-10-04 16:25:26
In some countries it is Day, Month, Year.
@_date: 2016-10-25 21:35:15
Some people, are willing to spend and loose money to fill blocks to prove a point.
@_date: 2016-10-17 21:16:00
I would contact the website once it is confirmed for information about that.
But for future reference make sure you put a decent transaction fee.
I would recommend 20K satoshis
@_date: 2016-10-26 17:54:38
still showing 25k for me, maybe blockchain.info is glitching?
@_date: 2016-10-19 23:01:04
a bit of both.
@_date: 2016-10-23 22:43:33
On blockchain look at the size then divide the transaction fee by whatever the size is. so for exmaple 20000/250bytes if the calculation is between 50-60 it will confirm fast if it is under 45 expect a decent wait time.
@_date: 2016-10-27 19:30:38
Well, since the fee is so low if you wait long enough the transaction will probably be rejected and put back in your wallet.
Or depending on the wallet you are using you might be able to retract it and double spend it.
Sorry, was not trying to be rude. :P
@_date: 2016-10-18 02:15:00
Yea that's why it's best to just become verified and use an exchange, in person shops depending on the country you are from are still a legal grey area at best, or a red zone.
Some places require Money Transmitting Licenses.
@_date: 2016-10-29 22:00:59
Great news but can we stop reposting this, like the 5th time I've seen it this week...
@_date: 2016-10-26 19:12:06
I personally think its just a glitch/error on blcokchain.info
@_date: 2016-10-30 03:55:34
I'm sure he understands the risk, but 4Pounds... someone would literally have to be so far gone in life to open a  chargeback over 4pounds. LOL
@_date: 2016-10-24 22:42:49
if you have done 1k transactions you have certainly waited more then 3 minutes, the average blocktime is 10mintues sometime going all the way up to one hour, because of the time between the last block and this one their is a backlog of txs tht will take a bit to clear up.
@_date: 2016-10-27 21:24:44
They can only identify other transactions from that specific address, for them to get your personal information they would already have to know exactly who you are in real life and be expecting a payment from you.
It's not really a big deal, as long as you are not buying pounds of cocaine you can use the same address's as much as you want.
@_date: 2016-10-27 22:48:51
Rev is one of the few who have been arguing with anyone who said it was a spam attack, disregard him.
@_date: 2016-10-27 19:59:38
It's possible if you wait long enough the transaction will fail and be sent back to your wallet or try contacting green address. It's worth a try.
@_date: 2016-10-26 15:44:16
Because people are filling the blockchain with spam transactions, paying 10$ to send 20$ from TONS of dust address's resulting in only a small amount of txs being on each block and a massive backlog.
@_date: 2016-10-21 19:06:20
The Forest city is lurking everywhere. :)
@_date: 2016-10-26 18:43:14
Although bitcoin is a good payment alternative, IMO it is 75% Store of wealth/Commodity and 25% payment method. SO being able to achieve the tps that visa does for instance does not seem necessary.
@_date: 2016-10-18 00:47:41
Their is pretty much exchanges everywhere in the world that you could get verified with and deposit cash for small fees, where are you located?
Although it's a bit high it is not unheard of, as what they are doing is likely money transmitting which is illegal. :P
@_date: 2016-10-27 23:48:08
Don't get me wrong I disagree with a HF, but if one was to happen would I go batshit crazy and abandon Bitcoin? Hell no. I'll gladly make $ by having coins on both chains. lol.
I just think its probably healthy for someone like me to offer a differing opinion then yours so people can make up their own minds.
I'm not the type to get angry and down vote someone who has a differing opinion from me and call them a "hater".
@_date: 2016-10-28 16:44:00
Most got confirmed. they were only building up for a few days as the price rised, some was spam as well.
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:44:23
It should work after synch just be careful with the fee, if possible change the network fee higher or you might send the coins with too low fee and rip.
@_date: 2016-10-26 15:45:50
well segwit will probably be implemented within a month or so and right now peolpe are spamming the blockchain with hundreds of dust address transactions, paying 10$ to send 20$ to purposely fill up blocks and cause havoc.
@_date: 2016-10-18 02:35:45
This example right here is actually the reason so many alt coins have high market caps.
Many of the strong 3year+ stable coins are no longer in the the top 10,25 heck even 50 on the listings simply because tons of ICO's and premines have bloated market caps that don't reflect the coins real value.
It's sad.
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:27:03
4k, here we come? lol
@_date: 2016-10-07 02:31:52
You live in canada and do not have a bank account? Why not go open one? If you are in a big city their is atms.
I think QuadrigaCX offers a cash or cheque option but i believe you need to be verified? could be wrong.
@_date: 2016-10-18 19:53:03
This article is a bit misleading, you do not need to go through that equifax bullshit to use the exchange, only certain aspects of it.
Many many young people simply have nothing to show on something like equifax therefore making it not possible to use this for everyone.
Regardless, I am glad they brought this cash option out and raised limits, they are certainly the best exchange within CA.
@_date: 2016-10-24 23:17:14
huge but i've seen worse, it should be comepltely cleared up within 24 hours.
@_date: 2016-10-23 01:32:05
I think paper wallets do sill have a use if you really lpan on not touching your coins for 5-10+ years.
USBs do not have as long of a lifespan as paper sealed in plastic in a dark place, not only that but magnetic shifts in the earth can destroy and deteriorate harddrives/USBS. So although I like HW wallets PWs still have a use case.
@_date: 2016-10-20 21:44:41
Localbitcoins possibly, maybe a bitcoin atm? although that's a bit of a reach. Maybe an exchange allows customers from your country?
The best way would probably be to meet someone within your city who is willing to do trades for cash, yes it is a bit risky but considering the information you provided here it sounds like everything is risky where you are.
@_date: 2016-10-21 19:50:06
Well first of all, i would never keep 100k$ of bitcoin in one place, I would say get 2-3 paper wallets, a couple hardware wallets(multibit, electurm.. etc) some btc on a few different exchanges and a 2-4 bank accounts.
so say you have 3 exchanges verified sell 33k through each to 3 different bank accounts. Might seem like a bit of work but would it not make you feel a hell of a lot safer. Heck maybe even send 5-10k to paypal, maybe some steam skins, runescpe gold, anything with value.
Why are you afraid? haha ;)
Also don't forget about localbitcoins, it's good to have a few options for selling.

Not every fork results in two opposing blockchains, in the scenario this guy posted, i can be 99% certain almost everyone would adapt the updated chain as btc and the other one would be trashed

Why does it not surprise me coinbase has problems when it dips? lmfao.
@_date: 2016-10-28 15:40:39
I think most people who have trouble are generally exchanges or people that randomly out of nowhere start dealing with 10's of thousands of dollars, if you are just spending small amounts on bitcoin that are on par with the types of things you usually buy i don't think you have anything to worry about.
@_date: 2016-10-20 20:23:47
I mean depending on what you would define an organisation as it could be argued that we are a decentralised organisation from all aspects of life and every continent on earth.

It's not normal try using the viabtc accelerator is your only hope.
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:37:58
It costs like 6$ to send bitcoin once, lol.
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:59:33
A bit lower, sure. But most people will likely be using exchanges and they don't change fees that often.
@_date: 2017-06-21 04:35:48
I've neevr been in a situation where I've had a transactiona round longer then 24hours, so I'm not 100% sure, i've heard both like you as-well, But if it got accepted into viabtc hopefully you will be in the next block they mine, good luck. :)
@_date: 2017-06-21 03:52:05
Try and use the VIabtc accelerator every hour or so until it is not full then hopefully within 12hrs it would be thru, or you can bump the fee on it depending on the amount/a few other variables
