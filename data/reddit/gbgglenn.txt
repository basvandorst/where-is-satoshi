Anyone have any idea of when we can expect the sidechains to be a part of the system? Do the devs have a roadmap?

CFTC could try to repay everyone who lost something with the $75000 they got from finex earlier this year.
@_date: 2016-08-06 10:15:40
Where can i buy "dodgecoin" and "steam"? lol
@_date: 2016-08-06 10:02:16
Couldn't it be some kind of exponential graph? The searches for "blockchain" have atleast doubled since 2013 while the searches for "bitcoin" have gone down.
@_date: 2016-08-05 21:23:43
No need for that. We already have Storj/maidsafe and probably plenty of others. :p
@_date: 2016-04-16 23:14:00
That trendline have been broken several times depending on where you're putting the lines.
@_date: 2016-04-23 09:25:14
Wow, times changed. Two/Three years ago, bitcoin was nothing but something that criminals used.... Well i guess bankers belongs in that category aswell, but still. ;)
Positive news from mainstream-media will definitely push the price up. Btc and blockchain technology is finally getting the respect it deserves.
@_date: 2016-08-07 14:34:33
This is the reason why i'd never help anyone buy btc. I'd be happy to tell anyone what btc is and how it works, but i'd never want to be the one responsible for someone's loss. 
If the person is not interested in knowing what they're buying then they shouldn't be buying it. Storing $15,000 AUD on a phone?
I feel bad for you thought. Trying to be nice and help out and it goes the other way around.

Bitsquare is good for exchanging, not trading. Some people are left with no choice.

You can see liquidated contracts on Okcoin's website. A very large amount of contracts got liquidated earlier today.

Does it matter? 
@_date: 2015-12-11 18:04:43
Seems like bitcoin is not only mt.gox or silk road in media these days.
@_date: 2015-12-11 18:52:44
It wasn't a long time ago sites like bloomberg were bashing the shit out of btc. A year back, they were definitely not writing anything positive about btc.
@_date: 2015-12-22 21:05:51
a) It can't be safe, someone is controlling it and if they take down the internet your money is gone:
Who would take down the internet and why? Our system is built on a working internet.
b) I read about Silkroad, they stole all money. How can you say this is better than cash ?
Of course your bitcoin could be stolen if you let someone else control them. The same applies to cash.
c) I lose my computer and the money is gone.
Ye, if you give them your private-key and password. Same thing with cards, give them your pin-code and the card and the money is gone.
@_date: 2015-12-06 11:18:04
"I've could've bought earlier", that does'nt matter. You didn't see the potential in it back then anyway. Can't see i did it myself. The only thing i used encryption/cryptography for, was to encrypt word-documents so the teachers would believe that i made my homework.
@_date: 2015-12-27 10:33:40
Why do i always see comments telling op to buy btc in the same amount instead of buying a miner? The new miners are what we need to keep the system away from being to centralized. 
Ont: If it's money you can afford to lose and if you are a person who likes to have some projects running, then i would'nt think it's a bad idea.
@_date: 2015-06-02 09:17:03

This is mainly why i want btc or the blockchain technology to succeed. I don't give a jack about the price. Want to be able to look at it in a couple of years and say: "-told you".

I am always skeptical when I hear "I/my friend had a bunch of btc but stopped using them when....."
@_date: 2015-06-28 09:14:47
Because people are conservative and also because they dont understand it.

Atleast my coins wont be out of circulation. Already written a letter of how they can be accessed that my family is allowed to open when im lying in a coffin under a shitload of dirt.

Interesting to see such a small nation getting 4.

@_date: 2014-04-16 15:20:32
Would advice you to not store them on an exchange.
@_date: 2014-02-03 11:07:34
Next time someone is about throw their BTC away, im willing to take them for you. ;)
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:30:11
Totally agree, would never trust a website. After all its not the first time BTC's gets whiped out from exchanges.
@_date: 2014-08-06 12:51:58
Nop. Since i dont want to get blamed on if money gets lost. Gave my brother some bits to invest in something at havelock though. 
I'd be glad to help someone if they'd ask me but i wont put time and effort in holding for someone else if im not sure if even my own are safe. 
@_date: 2014-08-07 07:57:37
What will you make/create? What would you get in exchange for the gold if the economy fails?
Maybe the answer is BTC in the future?  By then you'll hopefully just get a few bits.
The title says "help me decide" but im not really sure how someone is going to convince you. 
@_date: 2014-06-23 10:22:08
Intresting.

Bitcoin core. 
Thank you.
@_date: 2014-08-07 18:39:39
.....because you've already made up your mind. It's hard to like something if you "already know" that you wont like it.
I'd say you buy 1 USD of BTC, read about the blockchain and the whole system. Experiment with it. 
I cant say that your arguments for gold are solid at all.
1: "You can't do jack with bitcoins" , wrong. By 2009 you could'nt. Now you can.
2: "SD cards" being stolen?  How about gold being stolen? Fiat currency being stolen? No difference to BTC. If you cant keep it secure, it will get stolen.
3: You talk about something that people say is money and something that is money. Do you really know what money is? You could use pretty much anything as money if someone else sees the value in it. 
Sure, go ahead and keep your metal and use your papermoney while i join the revolution and future instead. I might be wrong, time will tell.
@_date: 2014-05-22 10:38:35
Agree, moving to bits would get more people onto the train.
@_date: 2014-09-24 18:37:26
If you're not willing to buy, start mining then.
@_date: 2014-03-08 14:47:40
Talking with people who don't understands bitcoin is always the same.
Ignorant people who thinks they know everything about world economy. To bad they can't even see the difference between a "digital" currency and a "virtual" currency.
@_date: 2014-07-27 20:16:29
Hopefully they wont get concussions due to the shitload of paper being thrown at them.
@_date: 2014-03-22 14:12:01
Would say that an exchange would be easiest way. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 19:20:34

Ah ok, will be doing backups more often then. As it looks right now i got it on 1 USB. Will get some more as soon as i get some money. Life sucks when you dont have a job and lacking work experience. ;)
Will google a bit on encrypting wallet and might do it aswell.
Thanks everyone.
@_date: 2014-08-11 15:10:05
Don't they ask for higher prices?
@_date: 2014-08-01 18:54:10
Wont discuss bitcoin with other people to be honest. Done it a very few times and they keep changing subject and dont listen at all. Tired of people giving me the "stupid-stamp". 
I'd rather let the time pass and hopefully they'll realize what they're missing sooner or later.
Only time i talk about it is if someone asks me something about it.
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:53:53
They'll understand what BTC in a couple of years or so.
@_date: 2014-11-23 21:24:57
Haha spot on!

By many issues he must have meant that it's not user friendly for "tech-nerds"?
@_date: 2014-02-17 20:32:42
Got it around September/Octobre for around 600 USD i think.
@_date: 2014-02-27 09:38:22
Thanks for the really good answers. But is there a reason to why they can't steal BTC to the network, or can i read about it somewhere?
@_date: 2014-08-07 16:02:18
Wow! You are so ignorant! Life is gold.... Right?  There is no reason to even discuss with you. You can't see any upsides with bitcoin and you cant see any downsides with gold. 
Dont invest in something you don't believe in. Dont invest more then you're ready to lose aswell. Simple as that.
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:09:38
Does the hashes that comes up helps the BTC to transfer between wallets, and does it improve the security of the network?If so, what would happen if people stopped mining when all BTC are mined?
Is there any way any hacker in the future will be able to get into the network and steal (i've heard of the bug a couple of years ago).?
Might be stupid questions but im interested in knowing.
@_date: 2014-08-14 07:47:46
Why should we force BTC to rise? 
@_date: 2014-08-03 08:05:58
"reduced volatility"
Is it centralized or how come the volatility is reduced?

To be honest, i feel fucking stupid for dreaming about something like that.
@_date: 2014-08-18 09:10:21
Got scammed. Got a small amount of BTC for small skins but still scammed me on about 5 Euro. Wich is around  0,01356 btc.
Is there any site where people get reputation when buying/selling so i can see reviews of the people?
Sure, 5 EUR is not a big deal but is still something. Gave the dude a discount from 7 EUR aswell.
Edit: Got my money now, he unfriended me but i added one of his friends to ask him for me. Later on he sent me the BTC. Gave his friend a skin to thank him aswell. He probably felt bad about it since his friends found out what was going on.
@_date: 2014-07-06 13:25:50

@_date: 2014-06-28 12:38:00
Dont know if this is a good idea.... I would not advice a non-technic person to buy BTC just to do it. 
@_date: 2014-08-09 10:55:21
I use Justcoin regularly. Never had any troubles with them. Great support too. 
I am from Sweden and only downside for me with JC is that it takes time to deposit money into your account. But that is the banks fault.

@_date: 2014-06-02 21:33:51
Close Bitcoin.qt
Type %appdata% in the windows search and open "roaming" map.
Rename the map "bitcoin" BUT DO NOT remove it incase your wallet.dat file is in there
Start bitcoin.qt and a new "bitcoin" map will be created and download the whole blockchain. 
You can copy the wallet from the previous foldier to the new one.
Worked out for me.
Btw, you do have your wallet backed up?
@_date: 2014-07-10 06:01:55
Well done.  Mined around 0.006 at triplemining but cant reach them since i need 0.001 to withdraw. Stopped mining for a pretty long while ago. ^^

@_date: 2014-07-02 17:32:03
Social media and a new invention are 2 complete different things.
Of course it's easier for social media to grow faster due to already existing programs and sites such as MSN, mIRC, Myspace etc etc. Would compare this to people switching bitcoinwallets depending on what the new ones could do for you instead of the old ones.
@_date: 2014-06-01 16:46:43

My dad acutally called me when he heard it on the news and wanted me to explain what happened. The media got no idea what they are talking about.

Large amount of money would be easier to steal in btc then in gold.  ;)
@_date: 2014-05-27 18:50:39
..... and suddenly dogecoin becomes more valuable then BTC ;)
@_date: 2014-03-06 10:49:45
Hm.... So if i get it right, if i want to have it on another PC i need to put my .dat file into the bitcoin-folder to open it?
@_date: 2014-09-14 18:14:17
I mined BTC back and forth for a whole summer during 2013 and earned around 0.0006. I would say that its not worth it since your laptop will most likely get destroyed.
Difficulty is way higher theese days aswell. If i were you i'd buy some btc or buy shares at havelock.
@_date: 2014-02-02 19:59:30
Hm.... You could try finding locals in your area that are selling BTC's. 
@_date: 2014-06-07 11:15:31
Is that the kind of friend that would blame you if  he actually lost all coins aswell? Just because he's to lazy to learn how it actually works?
@_date: 2014-11-09 17:23:59
Am i the only one here still sticking around with bitcoinqt?
@_date: 2014-06-04 21:17:21
As always:
Just put the amount of money you are ready to lose. 
@_date: 2014-06-29 15:33:53
The chance of the person losing money is greater than the chance of actually earning something.
BTC is in a phase where it is not very user-friendly. A person who does'nt have any interest in technical stuff such as computers and is not spending alot of time with it will most likely get problems.
Im talking about stuffs such as not backing up the wallet, storing the BTC on an exchange etc etc.
People will adapt eventually as BTC will be more user-friendly. We don't need to force people into it already.
@_date: 2014-03-10 19:05:59
Will take a look. :)
@_date: 2014-11-10 16:40:28

Top 10.
But this could be wrong? This is per adress, i guess that many people got different adresses with smaller amount of BTC.

So how do i open my wallet on his computer? :s
@_date: 2014-10-28 19:30:35
Just did.
Wanted to withdraw some EUR aswell but the fact that it would take to much time and effort to hand out all the info made me convert them to btc and withdraw them that way instead.
Hopefully i'll get it soon. I'd be happy if someone could recommend a good site for a swedish guy.

Seriously?  BTC is worth money in the same way gold is. It gets it value based on how much people wants it. 
Do you want someone to decide the value for you? The government? Thats exactly what most btc'ers want to get rid of..... Centrelization.

Not true, more people will get into it if it goes up. Remember that BTC still can be divided into 8 decimals 0,00000001 is the lowest amount of BTC you can get i think.

Mtgox is soon back on it's feet hopefully, a new ATM is launching too. 
People are panicing because of the "bug" that caused a bit of a crash at mtgox.

In other words you pay for something that does'nt exists. Saw an documentary for a very long time ago where another bank did the same.

Read in the newspaper that banks might take a small fee in the future for people using swish.
@_date: 2014-10-12 17:28:55
Feeling the same way here. 
I do believe that i would meet people with interest in Bitcoin if i put some effort in finding them. I do know bitcoiners exist in my city, seen loads plenty of posts online that connects bitcoin to where i live.
As it looks right now, i don't feel like i would need someone to discuss btc in real life either. Could do it here instead.

I heard about it around 2012, to bad i listened to my stupid ass brother instead of doing what i should've done. Mining ofc.

@_date: 2014-07-02 17:46:45
I can tell you that only people that loves technology pretty much are the only ones using Bitcoins. It is not user-friendly. Once it becomes user-friendly and mature enough for anyone to use, i think it will grow alot. We don't have to force a major adoption. There is no reason for that. That would probably hurt the system more than it would help.
People will get the hang of it eventually.

Hm.... Don't see why the banks would avoid loaning you money just because you own some. I can understand if they would give you a "no" if you are trying to loan to invest in it. Someone who just owns it will most likely be able to pay back in the future.

Couldn't care less. Everyone here will be laughing all the way to the bank in a couple of years.... Oh nvm.
@_date: 2016-06-04 16:03:22
I read that they payed ~$150 000 SEK (~$18 000 ) a day in electricity costs... 
3600 btc/day and they had 5% (?) of the network (atleast last time i checked). Don't know exactly what that'll be but maybe 180 btc/day? That would be around $100k/day at current rate.
 They are behind the bitcoinXBT-certificate on the stock market so i guess they couldn't sell alot of the btc they mined because they need to hold btc in order to back up their "bitcoin-tracker". 
@_date: 2016-06-02 19:24:25
Can they do this to a company based in Hong Kong? 
@_date: 2016-06-04 16:24:38
Ye, it will work in the start, but in the end they will end up coming up with numbers that doesn't even exist. Especially when they start working with the banks.
100 btc gets deposited --&gt; XAPO gets hacked and loses 50btc --&gt; People buys coffe for 100 btc.
XAPO will tell the seller that "we got the btc backed up, but we'll pay you in usd instead, trust us.". They will press ENTER and new money is made.

I don't get the
"ut the important thing to bear in mind is that if you have a backup of your current wallet now, you can run both clients/networks - essentially, if you have 1 Bitcoin, after the fork (if you have today's wallet backed up) you will have 1 Bitcoin, and 1 'BitcoinXT', each with independent values based on their popular adoption. "¨
Could someone explain? Also wondering if this will cause trouble to other wallets such as electrum.
@_date: 2015-07-19 15:06:37

@_date: 2015-07-20 20:25:42
Hm... Not sure if it really is ONLY because of cryptocurrency. I'd rather say that right now its mainly because of the amount of paper-gold out there. Correct me if im wrong, but seriously. It's not even real gold that's getting traded on the market.
If there was a proof that the gold you buy actually exists and that you can claim it, i would think that gold would regain it's value.
@_date: 2015-07-28 21:05:30

Is it possible to change blockchains with the coins?
Let's say you start following the xt-chain. Will i be able to move them back to the original one and vice versa? 
In what way do the coins get split? It says in the text that i will have 1 bitcoin xt and 1 bitcoin. Is THIS until i decide wich blockchain i will use? Or will i be able to spend 1 btc and 1 btc xt? 
Appreciate the answers.

It will make the price to go up if Winklevoss do as they say they will. They have modelled the ETF after the "SPDR Gold Trust" wich means that they are forced to buy bitcoin worth the same amount as the investors are buying shares in order to back it up.
If not, this ETF will probably have the same impact as GBTC have.... Bought at a premium price but will not have any effect on the bitcoin price.
@_date: 2016-09-11 15:48:59
Ye, it's rubbish. They're supposed to have enough btc to back up all the GBTC shares to make sure there is no "fake bitcoin" being sold/bought, but i've never seen any proof of it. A little more transparency would be good in ALL contracts that follows an underlying asset.
They can claim that they have x amount of bitcoins.... but do they? I really hope that the investors that are tech-savy enough buys bitcoin instead of the ETF's.

Not expecting anything else. Back in the days when the automobile-industry started to grow, they came up with a rule saying that the you're only allowed to drive in maximum speed of 4 mph, AND you also needed a person walking infront of the automobile with a red flag. Those who proposed the laws was the train-companys.
We are at the same place with bitcoin, banks trying to put a spanner in the works.

I guess the streamers can claim the money but i do think that there is a fee. It would be a way for twitch to earn more money instead of letting paypal, like most of the streamers use for donations be in charge. I think it would also mean a greater protection for the streamers from fake donations.
