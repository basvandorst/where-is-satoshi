~~I'm trying to still be optimistic, but I'm starting to feel like Bitcoin is a masterpiece placed in the hands of people who don't think it is.~~
eh MashuriBC is right, I take it back.

I read his pitch, it IS for a blocksize that scales over time and grows.
I'd support it IF he can show a math breakdown of transaction fees per block, and when the transaction fees will total (for example) 50 BTC per block as it was originally. for instance I just checked block 362092, which just minutes ago processed nearly 40,000 BTC, and .25 btc in transaction fees. if most or all transactions are free or trivial, and it scales so it's ALWAYS free or trivial, there will never be any incentive to keep mining once the blockchain generated BTC dies off and we're fully reliant on the transaction fees to self-sustain.
sorry, but this is a horrible move long-term. what would it take to convince me otherwise? show me how miners will turn a profit as the BTC rewards drops off.
@_date: 2015-06-22 21:29:55
excuse me, but this is going to kill off mining. the WHOLE POINT is that eventually the transactions will need a transaction fee in order to receive priority status. you shouldn't be able to send free or trivial fee transactions quickly. this is a benefit of being in the early stages, but wasn't supposed to last. as the bitcoins mined per block decreases, the transaction fees supplement, and the miners have an incentive to keep buying equipment and spending on electricity.
you're going to shoot yourself in the foot. it's fast and it's cool that it is free right now, but it was never intended to stay that way.
@_date: 2015-06-22 23:08:39
because then higher transaction fees implying higher priority would implicitly favor the rich. all the transactions moving 10k btc would take precedence and the guy buying a sandwich would never happen. what WOULD work is if priority was assessed based on the PERCENTAGE of your transaction fee vs transaction total.
@_date: 2015-06-22 23:48:26
agreed. DE-flation was one of the key concepts for BTC. it's why it goes to so many decimal places the the dollar only goes to two.

+1 and seconded. where's gavin when you need him?
I feel like this is a REAL suggestion that solves the REAL problem better than bandwidth manipulation.
@_date: 2015-06-23 00:00:16
fair enough. I take it back.
@_date: 2014-03-05 23:38:29
upvote for this. OP is yet another person who doesn't understand what bitcoin is actually for. it's not made for face-to-face transactions like when you're buying a banana. it's meant to be a secure way to send money from anyone to anyone else in the world quick and easy. OP's analogy is mistaken. you wouldn't pay in BTC at a pub no more than you'd bring your passport with you to a club as ID. yeah it can kinda sorta work, but it's made for different things.
@_date: 2014-03-26 23:58:01
this article is idiotic.
IRS: Do you have bitcoins?
Me: No.
they can't prove a thing. so what's the big deal? it's anonymous for a reason.

explain. right now the net is neutral. the vote on the 14th is to repeal it. to repeal it means the ISP can charge based on your traffic (e.g. traffic is no longer "neutral"). ergo they can charge extra (even lots extra) for access to bitcoin and mining nodes.

I've used bitcoinpool before, they have a loyal base and a fun community (they give away a GPU a month as a door prize / reward), but the smaller pools and slower payouts make me nervous. Am mining for them right now because slush is still recovering the speed he had before his attack, and btcguild for some reason keeps disconnecting my miners and leaving them with no work.
@_date: 2011-10-13 05:36:13
I use bitcoinpool as my alt. small yet dedicated base with 0% fees.

Just the offer cheered me up plenty.  :)   Unfortunately I just spent all mine a few weeks ago. Gotta let the miners catch up a bit now.  :P   You sir, have officially earned my business in the future.

didnt know reddit had a pool! awesome!
@_date: 2011-11-12 19:19:11
That is awesome. I am more than ready, willing and able to believe in cheaperinbitcoins. I'm just a bit twitchy because I ordered a few things from btcdeals.com right before the guy "got sick" and the site went offline completely--no refunds and no returned emails. 
@_date: 2011-11-12 18:06:34
I've heard of it but it seems too good to be true and makes me nervous about ordering. they have SO much good stuff. you guys are saying it's legit? has anyone ordered anything worth more than 200 BTC from them that can testify to this?

i don't get involved in the circlejerk too much -- but this is precisely why I don't HODL forever and get all starry-eyed. every few years I spend all my BTC, on the fear someone from 2016 has withheld a block and is waiting to rollback the whole network one day. I'd rather have something to show for my work than nothing in this case. Roll back to 2016 if you must -- i'll still have my video card I bought.
@_date: 2013-03-26 00:04:27
my best answer is, it's catching on, plain and simple. If somebody wanted to pay you Euros for your product/service but you didn't accept Euros, you're losing money! If you don't know or are uncertain about the technology, you don't have to "keep" your bitcoins, trade them in for USD on an exchange.

not sure. they start shipping this month. I preordered a jalapeno last august, but used paypal so I had recourse if they turned out to be a scam. hopefully that order is in one of the earlier batches. as time went on and they looked more and more legit (and the value of BTC kept rising), I decided to spend them. :)
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:10:43
BFL's taking an extra YEAR absolutely SCREWED ME INTO THE GROUND.
Spend 50 BTC on a 60 gh/s because at the time it was revolutionary, and an advertised estimated lead time of a few weeks.
It arrived only a month ago...
@_date: 2013-01-29 20:07:44
right now I'm kinda watch and see. if it dropped to about 14 by summer I wouldn't be surprised. but I'm happy to see it go up and stay up :)
@_date: 2016-07-03 14:50:26
But I can quit anytime. 
@_date: 2013-03-05 06:56:06
I faced the same decision you did. I decided to hold mine, gambling that the value of btc would rise enough, that they'd be worth more than the time lost by waiting to order.
I originally paid with paypal back in august, so I had recourse in case they were a scam.
their forum posts were encouraging.
however, the final nail in the coffin (of my doubt) was when avalon shipped. these "magical" asics in fact can / do exist, and their claims were no longer far-fetched.
to top it all off, the BFL forums has pics of the first batch in testing. :)
all these are good enough for me.

oh wow, thank you!

I was mining for the long haul from way before that. I saw it is "awesome! cheap GPUs on ebay!"
"dark days"... hardly. in terms of the hardcore mining community it was the renaissance. the casual guys left, and those that serious remained, and were challenged to come up with faster and more efficient algorithms.
@_date: 2013-02-19 21:56:19
Dear Future Readers:  (a la xkcd)
This is an issue with the Bitcoin Wallet related to trying to process lots and lots of very tiny and very old transactions into one large lump sum to submit. Break the transaction into smaller transactions of between 10 and 15 BTC, and those will go through.
@_date: 2013-01-29 00:46:52
the general consensus was the market was over-saturated with speculative investors, who didn't know up from down in computing or currency or cryptography, but just knew they could make money off it. therefore it was a bubble. all its value came from exchange trading and not from use as a currency.
additionally, the long-haul guys I mined with before, during, and after this time all told you it was hyperinflated and the math trends didn't support prices that high, and while $30 (and the press that goes with it) was awesome, its true value in our eyes was still ~$3 a BTC. And we treated it as such. The price falling was more of a "told ya so" than a defeat.
@_date: 2013-01-29 00:52:54
also fyi, I do not believe this is a second bubble. I think the "true" value of bitcoin right now it about $12-15. I'd be happy to be proven wrong, but I wouldn't be surprised if there's another slight dip coming by summer. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:11:47

can someone pair this with a chart of bitcoin's USD value over the last few months, and predict, say, if I'm sitting on 50 btc, spend on a preorder now (assume arrival in May). Would getting an ASIC 2-3 weeks earlier offset the price gain BTC will experience in that time?
@_date: 2013-05-29 16:10:24
Paypal hates bitcoin. They have forever. I suggest doing some googling before assuming a company like Paypal, which will eventually be put out of business by bitcoin, will allow such a thing.

ISPs are currently required to monitor for things like pirating and kiddie porn. it wouldn't be unreasonable for the gov't to say "ISPs, here is what a bitcoin packet looks like. block everything that looks like this, and everything on the bitcoin ports." this would drive it to the TOR network, which would limit it's ability to be accessed by average Joe's. (in turn, the bitcoin community would release a bitcoin client that defaults to TOR, and it would continue; likewise if they blocked ports, it'd be a difficult change to propagate, but the bitcoin foundation would just use a different port)
so I suppose in writing this, my answer is no. any gov't or high-power organization with influence over ISPs can seriously dampen it in the short-term (a year or so) on a technical level.
the BEST course of action would be to let it grow, and bust the hell out of anyone doing anything slightly illegal with it. start a PR campaign. convince the masses bitcoin is for drugs and hits and guns. if you use bitcoin you are a criminal. the gov't will be watching you... oh wait they tried that. :)
plan 3 would be completely uncharacteristic of gov't because it requires organization and skill, but would be to beat the network at its own game. take their iowa and virginia processing centers for a few hours, take over 51% of the blockchain, fork it intentionally, let panic ensue, and continue to fork it about once a week, even though the network wont have fully recovered yet. however the window is closing on such an option. ASIC devices are game changers, and the gov't supercomputers, as GPGPU devices, aren't specialized enough to churn out the speed needed to control the network. in short even with their resources, there's only so much mining you can do on a computer designed to model weather and crack cyphers.
plan 4 is to stockpile btc. china appears to be doing this. whatever it is, it's easier to win the game than to defeat the game itself. there are then two alternatives: btc dies a natural death, and the gov't wins, or btc survives, and most btc is now gov't controlled anyway. either way it's a win for them. america doesn't have the foresight or skill to do this. only problem with this is hackers are smart, and telling you china has a million btc somewhere that you can steal anonymously is one big honey pot. problems will come. things will be kidnapped and held ransom for btc. cyber security spending will increase. it's the wild wild west out there.
plan 5 is the US route. it's to hire economists from harvard and forbes to tell the leadership btc will fizzle out. then when the president or bank CEOs have questions, look at all these experts telling you not to worry. as long as you're not worried while I'm in office, things are going well. that's all I care about. done and done.

their ordering system for upgrades is broken, and you can't upgrade a paypal purchase and pay for it with BTC. I spoke to a rep from BFL about this and it just is what it is.
@_date: 2013-03-05 06:49:28
I originally ordered a jalapeno back in august, and paid paypal so I had recourse in case they turned out to be a scam. that order number is 6229--fairly close to the front. the order I just placed is 19472 -- substantially further away.
@_date: 2013-03-26 15:18:57
when explaining money to your little brother, you don't start with the US mint. It's easier to save that for later. Tell them it's a currency. New Bitcoins are generated by the network.
@_date: 2013-03-06 17:13:00
this is also my opinion. it's moved quite high quite fast, but:
1 - the actual bitcoin market is stronger now than it was then (e.g. people actually using it as a currency, instead of people hoarding them)
2 - the global recession is already in full swing. as your own rent gets harder to pay, there's a kind of "crap what did I just buy..." reflex. the people who bought btc now more than not know what they're getting into.
@_date: 2013-03-05 06:06:17
from what I understand everything is internal. I'll have to plug it into a USB to configure it for which pool, my login info, etc, and then just let it go.
