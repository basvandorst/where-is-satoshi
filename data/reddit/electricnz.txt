That Brian Redban guy seemed like a total fucking moron, everything that came out of his mouth led me to believe he didn't listen to a thing Andreas said.

The most interesting part of this interview for me wasn't the potential price of millions of dollars per bitcoin, but the shift of wealth from the oil barons to the early bitcoin adopters and the implications.

I was about to say wow the winner is quite the talented artist. Sucks that there was cheating involved.

I've never watched a Joe Rogan Experience cast before so I didn't know what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised at Joe's welcoming demeanour, but that other guy... if he's always like this then I think he is detrimental to the experience, especially if I was trying to learn something for the first time.

Nobody is trying to sell you anything, nobody is going to benefit from you believing in bitcoin or not. All he is trying to do is explain how things work to you.
Why do you sound like you are being scammed?

Are you serious?
One example he gave was reduces transfer costs. Sure a lot of world changing ideas that get thrown around here might not happen, but bitcoin reducing transfer costs is an undeniable fact of bitcoin.
To give examples, international wire costs about $20-$40, sending money back home to families when working overseas using something like Western Union has ridiculous fees, the poorer the country the more expensive it is to send to, if you don't believe me use the website and check it yourself, I just did.
Credit card merchant accounts, they require minimum volume and charge 2-3%. Bitcoin is 0-1%.
This is just one advantage of bitcoin, technology has improved enough so that we don't need middle men, we can get rid of the systems that were developed centuries ago, we have computers in our pockets ffs, step outside of your shoes and compare the systems from an outsider's perspective, why do we need to use such outdated technology and give profits to those who run them?

I just checked, looks like 3.8% at Westpac :/

I get 3.75% in my savings account. Looks like Americans get shafted pretty hard.

Yeah I guess I would put more in BTC if I had less than 1% interest PA. I only have about 5% in BTC atm.

That sounds awesome, too bad I was only 15 at the time and had no money.

So you just assume that any given English website's users are American by default? Wow, you basically just confirmed jcdobber's comment.
