does that mean they're planning to steal balances from people who deposit BTC that is tainted from the stolen BTC?

the bitcoins aren't really stored in the wallet at all - they're stored in the blockchain. 
the wallet contains private keys to allow you to create a spend transaction to transfer money from an address controlled by that private key to a new address. 
if you know someone's private key you can make a transaction that spends their money.. but how do you get it? certainly there are ways - the many high profile thefts are proof, but the private keys have never been stolen through a flaw in bitcoin itself, it's always been an attack through some other channel.

The only effect it could have would be psychological... the bitcoin market is so tiny that it gets knocked around daily by much more direct (if weaker) forces than QE.
bitcoin is a highly speculative 'asset' there's a good chance that it will wildly outperform inflation and almost everything else too, but it might fail completly at some point, so I wouldn't consider it a hedge - more of an outright gamble at the moment.
I think bitcoin could be extremely useful to Iranians - it's a shame nobody has yet established a bitcoin exchange in Tehran. There must be a lot of online goods they would like to be purchasing but can't due to the sanctions.

you can view any address's balance on  or  no need to hack up the bitcoin-qt wallet. It's all public information.
