Now that you mention it, it looks like he photoshopped at least part of his left shoulder. Or maybe it's hanging down weird, but the shadows don't seem to make sense..

I, personally, think it's going to continue to rise quite a bit, but I am not a financial advisor nor a psychic, so it's possible it could dip a bit or a lot. If it dips, that's a good time to buy. But how much will it dip? Will it even dip? If you wait you could miss out on some nice gains. If you buy now and it dips tomorrow you could miss out as well. That's why I buy every now and then and don't spend all my money at once. Buy a little now and see how it feels. Then hold on tight! (I'm actually one of those people that spends their Bitcoin too, but Im always holding a minimum amount)

Uh yeah there's been a [thread]( about this for an hour now.

I've been buying gift cards on Gyft quite a bit the last couple of years. Basically spending my gains every now and then. It paid for quite a few Christmas gifts already. Am I crazy?

You can get a good look at a bull testicle by sticking your head up a butcher's ass... No, wait. It's gotta be bull.

Just as much as you can afford to lose. I usually just buy $20 worth every now and then. Umm...it adds up over time.
