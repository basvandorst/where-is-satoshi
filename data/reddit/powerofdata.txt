Doesn't seem reasonable to assume otherwise.


Validity of a chain is decided by the hashrate. You vote by mining. That is what bitcoin is. 


Lower hashrate won't be bitcoin, as defined by white paper, and selling this coin as bitcoin by regulated exchanged **could be** fraud.
@_date: 2017-03-17 02:27:40
Regulators need a definition for bitcoin. The only definition of what bitcoin is - is the white paper. Exchanges don't define what bitcoin is.
If one sells a product to the costumer legally, you better be sure the product you sell is what you advertise, in this case selling a coin that is not defined as bitcoin and has a lower hashrate and sold as bitcoin **could** be fraud. 


Regulated exchanges have legal obligation so sell what they advertise, they don't get to decide what flavor of the month is bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-17 02:43:56
Kindly explain why.
@_date: 2017-03-17 02:55:18


Exchanges don't decide what bitcoin is, they have zero contribution to consensus, that means that it might be illegal to sell less secure, lower hashrate coin as bitcoin. 


Competing chains are not the same if one has more hashrate than the other. Where the majority of mining power is - is what bitcoin is. If regulated exchanges sell a costumer less secure coin as bitcoin they might be open for being sued for fraud.

Demand for what?


Read the bitcoin white paper, what bitcoin supposed to be is written right there in the title.
@_date: 2017-03-16 03:51:27


Bitcoin is not a collectible, it is a network and here to provide utility. Bitcoin currency has value because you need it to use the network.  
If the bitcoin network loses the utility - bitcoin currency will lose the value. The majority of people don't care about bitcoin for the sake of bitcoin - it is just code.


You need to take into the account the whole crypto pie, that was my point.


The hard truth is, if bitcoin can't adopt to market demands (the need for digital cash) then it will become irrelevant.
@_date: 2017-03-17 04:17:03
Maybe you should read what terms of services actually are and what limitations they have. Good luck.
@_date: 2017-03-16 01:08:03
The purpose is to be digital cash, this is what bitcoin is all about. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 05:26:29
There will be a hardfork.
People will move to altcoins when this happens.
The value of bitcoin will collapse.
Mining will continue to operate - because 'free' energy.
People won't use less secure, slower coin to move value.
Exchanges will be forced to list the majority hashrate coin as bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-16 03:24:32
I tried to warn them but it seems hopeless. 
@_date: 2017-03-12 02:18:47
Value doesn't come from nothing.
If bitcoin doesn't provide **actual value for people**, the market will realize that sooner or later and move to a different coin that provides actual utility. 
@_date: 2017-03-12 08:03:25


Are you trolling? 


Merge mining.
@_date: 2017-03-12 08:00:07


Yes it is, the miners will merge mine any coin with identical mining algorithm as long it has any significant value. The miners never lose, unless you switch to a different mining algorithm or completely move away from POW. 
This is not going to happen anytime soon in bitcoin, and that means that competing coins, that offer what people want, will gain the lost value from bitcoin.
Actually if you look at the data, the growth in overall altcoin market cap already has more than 10% of the crypto pie.


Rational = Economic incentive. Anything other than that is politics.
@_date: 2017-03-12 22:58:28
Any alternative will be merge mined by default, no competing implementation of bitcoin would dare to do anything that will cause it to be non compatible and as a result lose hash power. As long as mining pools operators can make profit of significant amount they will merge mine the alternative implementation. 
@_date: 2017-03-12 08:11:18
Now google Sybil attack.
@_date: 2017-03-12 23:32:22
Alternative implementation has nothing to do with being defined as 'hardfork friendly'. Alternative implementation = lower hashrate.
@_date: 2017-03-12 07:39:00
It won't be activated because there is no economic incentive for majority of people who run mining pools to activate it. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 02:43:17
You realize that exchanges are, right?
@_date: 2017-03-12 08:08:47
I think you should better educate yourself. If nodes had anything to do with consensus the network would have been under attack constantly, and nobody would trust it.

@_date: 2017-03-16 01:01:12
Yes, network effect is a real thing.
@_date: 2017-03-16 00:58:11
In the long term crypto is a zero sum game, there will be no need to use other crypto for moving value, because it will be irrational to pay conversion fees and use low security network.
@_date: 2017-03-17 03:50:12
So let me understand your argument:
You claim that if you open a regulated exchange and sell litecoin while branding it as bitcoin, that will be perfectly legal.
I guess you will have nothing to worry about as long it is a part of terms of services.
@_date: 2017-03-16 02:11:10
Yes I did. Unfortunately this is not how bitcoin consensus works. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 00:48:41


Or they will continue to drain the value and the network effect from bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 03:38:24
Show me the terms of services that legally allows exchanges to decide and define what bitcoin is.
@_date: 2017-03-16 03:26:13


 No it is not, bitcoin value has to come from something (digital cash).


Slow and steady is a way to lose network effect.
@_date: 2017-03-17 02:57:02
We talk about exchanges that economically matter. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 02:01:56
You are correct, and the way things are going, bitcoin might be defined as altcoin in the future. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 03:27:05
And I thought you might have something of interest to contribute. 
Good rule of thumb, read the discussion before commenting.
@_date: 2017-03-17 02:04:05
It might be illegal. An exchange that will sell less secure, lower hashrate coin as bitcoin could be sued for fraud by costumers. 
The only definition of what bitcoin is, is in the white paper, and regulated exchanges have legal obligation to sell the product they advertise. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 01:05:42


If you can be so kind to explain to me when and how this going to happen.
@_date: 2017-03-12 11:16:49


What it promised, to be digital cash. 
Consider how heavily promoted was it to be the solution for the unbanked, now it became something completely unusable for that market. 
Cash is also supposed to guard your privacy, and we know that is problematic for bitcoin, and if it can't be upgraded to offer that, then the market would move to alternatives.
Micro-transactions and privacy are fundamental for digital cash. Not to mention any future upgrades involving digital assets, decentralized exchanges and smart contracts.
If bitcoin development is stuck in politics, then really it isn't hard to imagine that one will begin to ask the basic question: what bitcoin has to offer that I can't get cheaper, faster and better going to competition?
@_date: 2017-03-16 01:58:01


With respect, the majority of the people in the world have no use for this.
@_date: 2017-03-17 03:07:29
I simply look at the volume. 
@_date: 2017-03-12 10:46:10


If bitcoin can't adopt to market demands, it would mean that the the network effect of bitcoin will weaken.
So you might see a decline in bitcoin value, and increase in value of competing coins.
Right now the best thing to look at is the of overall altcoin marketcap value which is all time high right now and is constantly growing.  
@_date: 2017-03-12 08:19:29
I have no problem being corrected if I'm wrong, which unfortunately is not the case here. 
I kindly ask you to read about Sybil attack.
@_date: 2017-03-12 08:39:43
Economic incentive: If the mining pools operators figure that they will **lose money** by activating Segwit then they won't. 
@_date: 2017-03-12 08:29:40


Would love to read your white paper on that.
@_date: 2017-03-16 01:27:49
Nobody is claiming that bitcoin can't be decentralized and still not be what it promised to be. 
Right now it is not digital cash: real digital cash has low fees, fast transactions and privacy.
@_date: 2017-03-17 04:10:04
I still don't see how terms of services can legally allow exchanges to decide and define what bitcoin is.
Selling a product that by any reasonable definition is not it, might be illegal. I might be mistaken and have no problem to admit it if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2017-03-17 03:21:47
With respect,the point of the discussion is not about the availability of buying less secure coin, it is about exchanges selling lower hashrate coin and branding it as bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-17 03:13:53
You're the one that talked about decentralized exchanges.
Right now, mentioning Chinese exchanges as economically valid option is problematic at best. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 02:05:49
The whole post is about realizing the hard truth - SegWit is dead. It is time to move on.
@_date: 2017-03-16 00:52:13
Crypto is a zero sum game, losing more than 20% market share is a serious deal. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 00:24:12


If people want for alternative implementation (identical mining algorithm with significant market value) to survive then they will be forced to implement merge mining so they won't lose the hashrate.
They won't be switching to a different mining algorithm or abandoning POW any time soon, as inner politics preventing them of doing any type of drastic change. They will have no choice but to implement merge mining.
@_date: 2017-03-16 00:54:36
This store of value meme has to die.
Value doesn't come from nothing, if bitcoin can't be what it promised to be (digital cash), it means it can't function as store of value.
