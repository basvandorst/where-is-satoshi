Congrats!  You should use a small part of your wealth to promote bitcoins by sharing some... to me.

Alternatively, you can just go to Mt.Gox on your iphone, and then add it's mobile page, which is pretty good actually, to your home screen.

If you own a jailbroken iPhone (or iTouch), then [this]( cydia app exists, but I've downloaded it and it just doesn't load for me.  Please respond if anyone gets it working.  Also, [this]( cydia app is much simpler in that it just posts Mt.Gox prices to your notification center, but I still love it and it works perfectly.

From what I read on this bitcointalk thread, it seems we're at the miners' mercy when it comes to transaction fees.  IMO our most plausible fight is convincing Mt. Gox to change it's optional fee from .0005 to .00005, and then watching miners follow suit.

can you elaborate

On Mtgox: USD -&gt; BTC -&gt; EUR.  Exchange depends on rates at the time, but I think it's significantly better than 10% fees.
