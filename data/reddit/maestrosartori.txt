Don't be a dick. Bitcoins are a good option.
@_date: 2014-01-20 16:43:10
well in your post you said you hadnt used either. which is my point. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 02:59:45
no fox poll is scientific. this is horse shit
@_date: 2014-10-05 03:35:07
Sounds like mass market manipulation to me. Just stating the obvious.
@_date: 2014-10-03 05:43:35
IBM could run a centralized blockchain with asics of their own. But the biggest part of the value behind bitcoin is the fact that it is not centralized.
@_date: 2014-02-15 04:48:23
I couldn't agree more.
@_date: 2014-02-15 10:45:39
@_date: 2014-02-23 01:16:04
I dont send any of my bitcoin to any exchange.
@_date: 2014-10-04 23:56:47
I'm LOLing hard at you OP
@_date: 2014-02-14 03:40:57
Correct answer Mr. Shill
@_date: 2014-02-15 15:28:42
@_date: 2014-02-22 21:46:14
whats not to believe. I control all my bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-28 05:19:11
its been shared here to excess
@_date: 2014-02-14 03:37:53
The shills are visiting @_date: 2014-02-28 05:14:18
it did happen to the ceo of bitcoinsnotbombs
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:48:19
replace the word bitcoin with money and you are right on........................................ the money
@_date: 2014-02-08 02:57:31
I think you may have it wrong. You are one of the unlucky ones. Most people seem to have very few issues with coinbase.

I couldnt care less. honestly

you dont use them but have never had a problem? hmmm might want to try using them before commenting on the subject.
@_date: 2014-02-28 00:48:06
Thats the purest FUD Ive ever seen. The guy doesnt seem super perceptive
@_date: 2014-03-13 00:09:16
Why wouldnt you want COMPLETE control of your money and have the ability to send it to anyone in a moments notice at low costs?
@_date: 2014-02-15 06:36:44
I third andreas

@_date: 2014-02-28 05:55:53
Ive never even used gox and this post bothers me
@_date: 2014-02-14 03:39:04
this is such a shitty idea I can't even express my disgust with it.
@_date: 2014-02-28 03:03:25
the free market will sort it out. If you dont store coin on an exchange its not a problem
@_date: 2014-03-07 04:14:40
an upvote for you

good to see such generosity 
@_date: 2014-02-14 03:58:12
hahahahahahah! Praise to jah, if I can buy bitcoin at 11 a coin
@_date: 2014-02-08 02:07:54
Ive made many many many many many transactions with coinbase and its always worked like clock work. Perfectly.
@_date: 2014-02-14 03:39:56
watch out the CIA is trying to kill bitcoin with shills left and right.

come on man... you're the one who said you havent used paypal or bitcoin and then said you had.  Make sense when you post.
@_date: 2015-05-14 04:01:31
It doesnt look like it does right now.
@_date: 2015-05-14 03:47:35
Thank you Helene Unland. Here is a link to your soundcloud in appreciation.
@_date: 2014-02-02 21:38:07
@_date: 2014-02-15 15:24:36
you get a coinbase token when trying to log into coinbase from a computer you have never logged in from.  If you have a coinbase account it means someone is trying to access your account
@_date: 2015-05-14 06:01:54
Here is the link to another awesome person on soundcloud that tipped me! 
@_date: 2015-05-14 03:51:18
Change tip is badass.... Once this spreads..... The fire will be unstoppable
@_date: 2014-05-10 19:16:02
call me a dumbass, but how do I collect this tip? thanks a ton btw.
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:46:30
I agree. It sounds shadey.
@_date: 2015-05-14 04:55:06
yes you can tip in bits.
@_date: 2015-05-05 23:42:55
I love bitcoin!
@_date: 2015-05-14 03:52:57
I believe you just do it the same way you would on reddit, but with comments under a persons song.  Someone complimented my song and sent me a good amount of bits in the comments.
@_date: 2014-01-13 18:50:24
Bitcoin is a very prime example.
@_date: 2014-01-23 17:35:57
holy shittaculation! This is amazing!
@_date: 2014-04-27 16:12:31
That's not how it works. Wallet addresses arent created by purchasing bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-05-14 04:53:45
You're a dick man.
@_date: 2015-01-04 21:57:18

@_date: 2015-05-14 05:08:38
If you want to hear songs that aren't as shitty as that demo go to my main page.  
@_date: 2015-05-14 05:27:17
Im aware of the low quality nature of the song but that doesnt change the fact that you are a shitty human.
@_date: 2014-02-23 00:32:44
smart people dont send all of their bitcoin to an exchange.
@_date: 2015-05-14 03:49:57
Thank you so much!
@_date: 2015-07-01 17:43:50
Paypal fees are insane.
@_date: 2015-04-18 20:32:44
I'm aware. I believe demand will increase eventually.
@_date: 2015-04-17 00:26:39
Looks like the buttcoiners have shown up to downvote this thread........ point made.

I would love some bits! bitcoin is the future!

I'll never understand toxic people like yourself. Getting off on bringing people down. People like you are what's horribly wrong with this world.
@_date: 2015-04-17 00:52:08
I stand by my comment.
@_date: 2015-04-17 01:05:36
Thanks for this.
@_date: 2015-04-17 00:55:31
So what you're saying is you have a vendetta against self important bitcoiners? lol awesome.
@_date: 2015-04-18 18:37:37
Ive experienced no losses yet. So take your condolences elsewhere.
@_date: 2015-04-04 08:04:47
Wow! Great game and I earn like 4 cents every 10 seconds. Love it!

top post in is a x-post from @_date: 2015-04-09 03:18:05
Is this a real concern? Malware code in the blockchain cant infect your computer from what I understood.
edit: words
@_date: 2015-04-18 18:49:00
Basically Im bullish as fuck. Going long.
@_date: 2015-04-03 16:25:10
Thank you so much! honestly!
@_date: 2015-04-17 00:46:48
Its hardly productive. Anyone with a ounce of intelligence can see the genius that is bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-04-25 00:38:15
bitcoin forever!
@_date: 2015-04-17 00:39:20
Why argue? I believe in bitcoin. I have no need to argue. But you are most definitely a toxic individual. I feel sorry for those that have to be close associates of yours.
@_date: 2015-04-18 18:57:58
All on paper wallets. secured and safe
@_date: 2015-04-18 19:36:40
no losses realized. I bought 9 of my 10 below 50 dollars.
@_date: 2015-04-03 16:24:33
Wow, thanks for all the generous donations! I'm truly barely making it. Now I can go buy a few groceries! Thank you!
@_date: 2015-04-18 21:06:00
@_date: 2015-04-18 18:44:47
Maybe I will experience loss on my 10th bitcoin, but not the other 9 unless it goes below 50 dollars a coin. So theres that.
@_date: 2015-04-18 19:04:36
Im not sure why people complain about bitcoin being so hard to secure and use. I just sweep my paper wallet with mycelium send the amount Im not using back onto another paper wallet and spend the remainder of bitcoin on what I need to. I think its made to be waaay more complex to use than it really is.
@_date: 2015-04-18 19:29:08
Do you always go around trying to bring others down?
@_date: 2015-04-17 00:42:20
You're toxic because you have a need to tear down others. Such a waste of energy. Go do something productive.
@_date: 2015-04-07 23:17:41
here here Gavin!
@_date: 2015-04-03 16:25:46
Thank you so much! It means the world to me. My art is my life!
@_date: 2015-04-18 21:15:43
no, I got the idea because I bought my tenth bitcoin
@_date: 2015-04-17 03:22:57
Thanks for the little lesson. Its not an assertion, its an observation from me reading this sub all day at work. I dont need to prove anything to you.
@_date: 2015-04-18 20:44:23
on paper wallets in a safe secure place my friend
@_date: 2015-04-17 03:15:52
There is more than a little contention going on.

You're a very antagonistic person. Similar to the type of person Im talking about swarming @_date: 2015-04-17 01:12:24
If you cant see the influx of anti-bitcoin sentiment, you are blind.
@_date: 2015-04-17 03:20:28
I'm not going find examples for you. Clearly, a lot of people agree with me. Do your own research. I don't have time to do it for you. If you disagree, you disagree.

I believe it will go somewhere... Despair is setting in. I feel it. This will pass and we will return to the mean. I believe. Its been a rocky road and I believe it will continue to be a rocky road even after the next ath.
@_date: 2015-04-17 00:48:24
initially the downvotes came in... the upvotes have won though.
@_date: 2015-04-17 03:51:15
show me where all these arguments of mine are? Sure I called you antagonistic which you are. But if you havent noticed the influx of posts mocking bitcoin and its users you arent paying attention.

@_date: 2013-11-16 13:17:42
The other funny thing about you is that almost every comment you say is in the negative with downvotes. Whats its like to be apparently and obviously disliked by most?
fuck you man. what you are saying makes no sense. going over your comment history its all the same. Fuck you.
@_date: 2013-05-15 22:29:44
I noticed this too.  I really want to understand what the hell is happening.  Its obviously related to mtgox warrant.  wtf!
@_date: 2013-10-11 15:31:01
safest way is a paper wallet. If you can't make sure a piece of paper is safe, then you are screwed.
@_date: 2013-08-26 21:51:14
Is it over? Or are you going to keep replying to me and pretending you aren't heavily invested emotionally in this discussion, MR BFL employee.

have you tried to contact an admin at BTCchina? In the future just use BTC-e.com Ive never had a problem with them
@_date: 2013-10-14 22:12:38
any failures of traditional currency seem like a boon to bitcoin in my opinion.
@_date: 2013-06-05 22:47:35
Holy Jebus. This just gives a teeny tiny window into how undervalued BitCoin actually is, but I know I am preaching to the choir. Long Live BITCOIN!
@_date: 2013-05-15 22:52:18
bitinstant doesn offer the ability to send to a bitcoin address as of today. wierd things are going down
@_date: 2013-11-11 15:21:52
I Will add some music for sure!
@_date: 2013-08-24 18:00:43
no I did not. your mind came to that conclusion on its own.
@_date: 2013-10-11 15:21:29
WTF. That sucks really bad. sheeple I tell ya sheeple
@_date: 2013-10-14 22:07:22
how does emailing that address prove anything? it could easily be you under a puppet account.
@_date: 2013-10-14 17:52:42
all I can say is wtf. I always wondered why they named themselves campbx. always reminded me of that disco biscuits mini fest called campbisco.. the name is enough for me to steer clear.
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:45:14
wow could anything be much more of a scam? no.. 
@_date: 2013-10-04 02:33:04
wtf does this post even mean?
@_date: 2013-09-25 17:02:19
yeah I want to know what a 920 is also.. I have a coinbase account and have no clue what that is.
@_date: 2013-09-12 14:45:07
why in the world would you get into bitcoin and asics with such little knowledge about bitcoin?  I find this insane.
@_date: 2013-11-14 20:44:44
not really a good attitude to have towards newcomers.
@_date: 2013-11-16 05:24:20
Its blowing my mind a little that some people aren't getting why coin validation is so bad.   It goes against everything bitcoin stands for. It takes the power out of your hands and puts them into some asshole middleman. Open your eyes.
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:50:33
at next fridays prices... whatever that will be who knows..
@_date: 2013-08-26 03:40:51
you are an incredibly caustic individual.  good luck at life.
@_date: 2013-08-26 21:28:12
Edit: It's Okay that you work for BFL. But just so you know, you aren't very good at hiding that fact.
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:49:38
so your handing out 635 dollars of free money day? you are a crook and a liar.
@_date: 2013-09-16 16:27:39
every investment is speculation. 
@_date: 2013-09-16 17:01:18
why would a person downvote something like this? does not compute! I agree by the way. Bitcoin is the future of money.
@_date: 2013-09-16 20:50:41

you're a little late to the party.
@_date: 2013-10-15 04:14:54
yeah well you suck massively. 
@_date: 2013-08-26 03:41:48
you are a fool. I have never ordered anything from them and I never will. you dont need to care but you seem too.. just stop replying to my messages and go back to being pissed off that everyone in the world doesnt share your point of view.
@_date: 2013-08-26 16:01:53
You dont know me. I dont know you. But you seem extremely invested in putting me down because I said fuck a company that you apparently have a deep level of loyalty too. Thanks for making my Monday morning a funny one.. I would waste less energy putting down  people that hate what you love. You'll have a better life. Trust me.
@_date: 2013-08-26 15:42:32
Jesus Christ. I said Fuck BFL and I still stand by the comment. The fact that you are still engaging me because I say FUCK BFL, is hilarious. Clearly you work for them. You corporate shill.
@_date: 2013-10-15 03:05:42

Okay! I will when I get home from work tonight for sure! How many song links should I send you?
@_date: 2013-09-17 19:38:50
Ive had it take a lot longer than that before... But that has only happened a few times..
@_date: 2013-08-26 15:45:02
you are funny. Are you seriously such a dick head that you cant take someone bashing a company they dont like?  You are a classic moron.

@_date: 2013-08-25 19:43:48
gee could you make it more obvious that you are connected to bfl? 
@_date: 2013-11-16 13:22:10
nice duplicate post moron. next.
@_date: 2013-11-14 20:59:54
no problem.
@_date: 2013-10-04 21:40:31
then why was he advertising the site years ago? It doesnt make sense that this guy would be advertising a site he doesnt own. because the claimed posts were supposedly before he bought it.
@_date: 2013-09-16 17:59:03
This attitude will turn away potential new adopters.
@_date: 2013-09-29 16:18:35
amazing. colored coins will help bitcoins worth grow exponentially.
@_date: 2013-11-14 20:45:06
I don't think its worth it to mine bitcoin at this point unless you have extremely exotic hardware. just go buy it.
@_date: 2013-10-15 00:19:36
I hope for nothing of the sort as it would most likely cause me to lose my job. Im only speculating.
@_date: 2013-11-05 16:07:29
This thread is laughable.
@_date: 2013-11-16 06:39:53
1 bitcoin will be worth 100k eventually, and thats just for starters...
@_date: 2013-09-16 20:26:25
and what exactly are they going to do? shut down every computer in the world. get real. All they can do is block entry and exit to the bitcoin world. It CANNOT be stopped.
@_date: 2013-10-04 15:23:49
excellent points. 
@_date: 2013-09-11 19:49:17
Ive never had a problem with coinbase. They are my primary way to purchase coin.
@_date: 2013-09-16 20:56:53
you seem to have a very fatalistic attitude and I dont believe for a second you have made a dime off of bitcoin. you would be better to focus your energy in a more postive way rather than trying to tear something down you dont understand.  Again good luck to you.
@_date: 2013-08-23 21:32:38
edit: coinbase is much better than bitinstant. You cant do anonymous purchases on bitinstant anymore.. So the site is useless now in my opinion.  They have always given me a price muuuuuuch higher than what I purchased coins at from them when I finally get the coin.  
@_date: 2013-10-04 22:10:27
well there is my answer.
@_date: 2013-10-04 21:35:48
also why was ulbricht advertising the silk road years back? I thought the dread pirate roberts had changed 2 or 3 times.. so him mentioning the website on forums 2 or 3 years ago makes no sense.... another guy would have owned the road at that point. maybe Im missing something here
@_date: 2013-06-27 19:30:29
I think its beyond silly when people post these goodbye threads.... need attention much?
@_date: 2013-09-16 20:28:44
oh brother. Why are you here again?
@_date: 2013-09-20 22:51:04
great post. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 19:08:17
you hardly have the voice of reason and intelligence you think you have. Its pretty clear you are someones shill.

what you're saying makes sense. but what doesnt make sense is ulbricht amateur moves.... suspicious as fuck imo
@_date: 2013-10-04 21:55:32
who knows... makes more sense to me that ulbricht was framed and the real dread pirate roberts is still out there.
@_date: 2013-09-11 04:12:38
where can I get one of these?
@_date: 2013-09-16 18:23:32
I understand that.
@_date: 2013-11-11 15:21:39

@_date: 2013-08-24 01:26:17

well Im glad the local idiot know it all came and into this thread to clear some things up.  So Satoshi didn't want it to be decentralized? Got it. He wanted control to be in the hands of the few? Got it. Thanks for clearing that up. Im glad we have local geniuses like yourself to tell us that no matter what happens with the bitcoin protocol, its just being "used" like everyone else uses it.. Man, you need to crawl into a cave and disappear indefinitely. Its people like you that make me fear humanities future. Thanks Again.

@_date: 2013-08-12 17:32:09
Thats not true. Empathy should always be extended to everyone.
@_date: 2013-08-26 22:25:28
To clarify pie oh pah is my lover. cheers.
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:12:19
I only know 2 people that own bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-09-16 20:41:58
I believe you will ultimately be wrong.
@_date: 2013-11-16 19:15:20
scheming dirtbags....
@_date: 2013-08-26 15:31:54
I was never an asshole. fuck BFL and fuck you for being a child about my comment.
@_date: 2013-09-25 17:16:08
Awesome. Glad you got your money back from those crooks.
@_date: 2013-09-30 14:51:48
edit: I agree, I think its a problem that turns noobies away. I offer my kindness. Bitcoin is the future, stick with it. You wont regret it. Just try to ignore all the pretentious assholes. There are no dumb questions.
@_date: 2013-08-26 15:38:18
what is your point? you were a caustic asshole because I said fuck bfl now your pretending to be kind? get over yourself and please do fuck off.
@_date: 2013-08-22 22:22:50
edit: great post. God I love bitcoin too!
@_date: 2013-11-16 17:42:25
you are truly an idiot. Just the fact that it doesn't raise alarms with you shows your level of intelligence. slink the fuck away now.
@_date: 2013-09-06 16:12:05
edit: we're not past the early adopter phase.
@_date: 2013-05-23 19:16:48
I cant wait for the next major move upwards!
@_date: 2013-09-06 16:17:30
I agree with you 100%
@_date: 2013-08-24 02:06:03
Seem Like BFL needs to be boycotted in a big way. Ill never buy from them. Fuck em.
@_date: 2013-10-25 03:22:19
@_date: 2013-10-04 21:33:32
yup it all seems highly suspicious
@_date: 2013-11-14 20:53:32
yes asics but butterfly labs is not the place to order them from. by the time you get them they wont be a profitable machine to use. BFL has taken a year to send most peoples stuff out.
