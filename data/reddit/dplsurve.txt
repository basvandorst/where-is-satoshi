More than likely we'll start with a service like "Gyft" convincing Wal-mart to sign-on to the program like Target, Amazon and WholeFoods, etc. 
Once Wal-mart crunches the numbers and sees that people are indeed using those Gyftcards consistently in it's stores then they'll need no further proof that they can bring this alternate payment system in-house and save a ton of money at the same time.
The "wealth effect" that one gets from having the option of spending some of the profits from an appreciating (alternative) currency does go along way in helping you feel better about spending freely at a time when you otherwise may not be able to.
I'm using my Gyftcards more and more at Amazon and Target ect. while Wal-mart is losing my business because of the convenience I get patronizing those merchant's stores that do participate with Egifter and Gyft, ect.

Bitcoin Foundation Goes To Washington To Educate US Policy Makers About Digital Currency: 
Members Of The Bitcoin Foundation Educated US Policy Makers About Digital Currency In A Meeting In Washington DC’s Capitol Hill Yesterday (8-28-2013).
Peter Vessenes, Patrick Murck and Marco Santori represented the Bitcoin Foundation and spent the day talking protocol, block chain and mining with representatives from the offices of several congressmen and senators.
Santori, who is chair of the foundation’s Regulatory Affairs Committee, said the attendees raised a number of concerns including privacy and anti-money laundering issues, but most just wanted to know how the protocol works.
"We talked about how the weight of regulation in the US can, and does, drive bitcoin service providers to move outside of the country,”
