What frustrates me is that there's no cancel button...

Wow, small world. He did the opposite to me, wasted a few days of my time, hoping to get my item today. At least you knew right away.

A suggestion: add some sort of mutual cancellation feature. Shopper could hit request cancellation and then earner could press accept cancellation.

That sucks, I know how it feels, man... :(
Right now my max amount per loan is about 50 dollars so that if I ever get ripped off, the most I lose is a small amount compared to my profits. Is this a viable method of combating charge backs you think?

True that, I transferred 50 USD to them and as soon as it completed they locked my account for "safety". Now I'm out 50 bucks :(

I'm sorry, you profit 1BTC, or sell 1BTC a week (that's a lot!)? How much do you invest? I've done about $100 USD so far and only have made $26.

No I mean Coinbase, it will take a week to get the BTC and it's possible that the price of bitcoin could go down just enough that I don't make money before I put it in the xcoins account. (though I realize it has to fluctuate $90 at least, so it makes me feel a little safer) Looking up Circle.

Okay so actual it's about $175 I put in. Where do you get your Bitcoin? With Coinbase I have a $200 instant buy weekly limit, if I want to buy more it will take a week and I'm afraid the price could go significantly down and I lose money or something.

Thanks guys, just wanted to make sure, as my dad is really cautious about anything bitcoin when I told him what I was planning to do. He said it's too shady or something.
