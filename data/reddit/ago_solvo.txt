I still haven't gotten my 2 dual dongles I bought for a mining through a Google Nexus.  They sent me dead power supplies on 2 different occasions and they didn't get back in touch with me for 2 weeks the first time, literally 2 months the next.  I have given up on them, they aren't worth my time.  I thought eventually they would clean up their act and get things sorted, but after hearing about how those new cards came faulty and they're offering refunds, I waited almost a year for my first Butterfly Labs order.  I have switched vendors.

If credit transaction fees were even just .5% for them, they'd save money.  The amount of money YOU the buyer don't have to pay, allows them to increase their prices.  It actually adds up to a lot.  The problem being that paypal and American Express are *encouraging them* not to do it.  It's been proven time and time again.  When you cut out the credit companies, and the banks, and both their fees (which every transaction gets hit for a total of about 5 times each, increasing the price you pay literally anywhere from 3% - 10%), you save money.  All these other companies aren't making and saving money out of thin air and making false claims.  This is about keeping power, control, and your money from you, that's it.

Every time there is a transfer of money, they pay a charge.  That's not just them, that's all of us.  And inbetween the process of buying, from your bank or credit card, to Amazon's bank, you get hit with 2.5% fees at least 3 times, in most cases about 8 times, as the money goes back and forth.  This increases prices an average of 5%-10% everywhere, and because credit is convenient and allows you to buy with money you don't have, they raise the price of paying with cash to match the price in credit, so there is no advantage for either, or for credit institutions and Amazon themselves, the advantage is using credit, that you pay interest and fees on.

I think at this point, yes they do.  I don't think you realize how dangerous it is to have all that power.  To just print money.  Realize as of 2014 on the Federal Reserve's website, they claim only $1.29 Trillion of U.S. dollars are in circulation.  There is far more than that, I'll just point out in 2001 Donald Rumsfeld had announced that they found the DoD had lost track of $2.3 Trillion dollars.  The Federal Reserve in front of a Congressional Hearing admitted they lost track of $5 Trillion about 5 years ago.  If you don't think every evil syndicate in the world, or other governments, or anyone, doesn't want in on that, you're wrong.  You can balance all that only so long, and I think we're literally at the point where everyone is fighting for control of the people who print unlimited amounts of money, which is why everywhere in the world they are just printing unlimited amounts of money at levels that the world has never seen.  All these entities are all looking at each other, realizing, this is really freaking bad, and needs to stop.  They *need* a system that no one controls, because it's too easy to print out a Trillion dollars and pay guy B to take out and replace guy A, who was protecting you at first but got too greedy.  I feel like behind the scenes where no one knows, there has been a turn around back and forth that made all these people agree on one thing, to make something no one has control over, because today's methods are just going to collapse everything.

They pay 2 or 2.5% in credit card fees 3 or 4 times.  You pay the fees yourself when you use your credit card, they're just not included in the transaction.  I can't find the infographic and the article that shows the amount of charges that are actually from all these transactions that inflate the price.

That is actually incorrect when referring to Bitcoin, because the term Bitcoin, refers to a system that is in fact very damned complicated.  It covers a very broad subject.  You can't just say, Bitcoin is a digital currency, you can't even just say, it's a cryptographic based digital currency.  You actually have to explain that it is a ledger, and how the whole system is powered by mining, it is very complicated, and I'm guessing if you posted that, you have absolutely no clue what Bitcoin is about or how to explain it to people.

And like Overstock.com and the thousands of other merchants that accept it, those transaction fees are far less than the fees the currently pay without Bitcoin again.  I don't think you have a clear understanding of how much banks, credit cards, and their transaction fees actually cost all of us.  Companies that use Bitcoin cut the items they sell regularly anywhere from 5% to 10% and still make more of a profit with Bitcoin.  That is HUGE.

He's just trying to steal the show from Rand Paul.  Rand Paul wants to Audit the Federal Reserve, which would also have repercussions for all the big banks, far worse than what Bernie wants to do.  I used to love Bernie, but I realized he's nothing more than a puppet.  He has these great statements he makes, but he's only reading them from a script.  If you see any tv interview he's on, all the interviewers do is elaborate over a statement he makes.  He then responds to questions by paraphrasing things from the statements he makes, being very vague all the time.  His statements caught my eye as well, these headliners.  A real politician for the people!  But if you ever listen to the guy trying to explain *his* ideas, he has no clue what he's talking about.  And I'm not that great a fan of Rand Paul either.  Bernie was brought in to be the bizzaro version of Rand Paul, a Liberal (really Socialist) viewpoint who takes on the same issues as Paul, but he doesn't have a plan to do any of this.  All he has is statements.  No plan, no idea.  The guy breaks my heart because I thought we really had a legitimate guy coming out of the Left who was going to change things for everyone.  Now he just disgusts me as I see him for what he is, just the same as nearly every other politician out there.

No, I mean only allowing exchanges to be transparent and report any new receiving addresses and the entity that opened the new address along with old addresses.  Otherwise the exchange can be labelled rogue, and all assets not acceptable in said country.  If a bunch of countries get together and agree to making it international law, there wouldn't be anywhere for anyone to hide their money.  They could make it mandatory to report all addresses and their owners.  Your address wouldn't be public so everyone could see what you have, but the government would make sure *they* would know.
@_date: 2012-08-13 02:24:37
You can be anonymous, but the Bitcoin can't.  Expect governments to flag untrustworthy organizations.  There will be acceptable vendors who are approved.  Bitcoin isn't anonymity, in fact, it is the complete opposite.  If someone uses bitcoins and those bitcoins are tainted, it will be as if those bitcoins can never be used again if a proper monitoring network is set up.  I think you all need to educate yourself better on what bitcoins are, and understand how they work.  Bitcoin is actually any government's wet dream, tracking all money, at any given time, anywhere.  All they have to do is make a registrar that is mandatory in order to trade in bitcoin that would name who owns what address.  Otherwise they can make the address, and all bitcoins associated with it, illegal.

Inflation - a persistent, substantial rise in the general level of prices related to an increase in the volume of money and resulting in the loss of value of currency.  Deflation - a fall in the general price level or a contraction of credit and available money.

@_date: 2012-08-13 23:35:08

You can't just tell people to spend, spend, spend, there has to be places to spend.  Realize that bitcoin is still in an early phase, it just came out what 3 years ago?  A market has to develop for it, vendors have to start accepting it, and if you've been looking around at the news, it is just starting to be used internationally with new businesses accepting bitcoin and being started up with bitcoin specifically in mind.  It takes time and it will get there, it may just take a few years.  This is a big concept for some people, it took me a long time to figure exactly what bitcoin was and what it was about.  I'm sure with due time, it will become much more common than it is today.  Give it 5 or 10 years, there should be a huge difference by that time.

It's ridiculous to take problems that regular currency has already, pretend it doesn't exist for regular currency, and then take all those negatives and suggest it is only a bitcoin problem.  I don't think bitcoin can be stopped, it's snowballing slowly but surely.

I emailed wikipedia regarding a post here about SudoGhost being unfairly biased against bitcoin and making edits as such as well as telling them that many of us were interested in donating in bitcoin.  Then I found the bitcoin donation fund that was made by some people for wikipedia and donated.  It was more a, "Hey we're not so bad and we like helping you so could you be a little more fair?" type email.  I think if they get more positive responses like that, they may ease off of us a little bit.  I mean if bitcoin is a ponzi scheme, fiat money isn't?  So should we remove wikipedia references to the U.S. Dollar?

Why can't they make exchanging goods directly for bitcoins illegal?  We made the ownership of gold illegal at one time too.  Black listing certain vendors that deal in "rogue bitcoins" also can be easily enforced.  The clear cause to do this in every country, well you can use what they've argued before, terrorism, crime, drugs, the black market, the silk road...  It would have similar regulation to what we have today to stop money laundering, I'm sure Interpol would play a big role.
@_date: 2012-08-28 07:35:53
So basically, the [consensus]( is, that you can make as many receive addresses as you want, but you only have one send address.  So, even if you use pools that switch up bitcoins, all you have to do, is make it mandatory to register every send address with the government like I said.  What people thought was complete anonymity, can actually become the most transparent system to see all people's wealth, if bitcoin becomes the standard.

The idea that they are trying to scam people that hate Romney...I can't agree with that, supposedly the information is going to be released anyway if Romney or his supporters don't pay.  This is a bad idea as a scam *or* as actual blackmail.  Any attempt to buy the confidentiality will just make people pry into his history even further.  Also, we'll all know if there is a payment made or not, since all transactions are public regardless of whom made the payment, we'll know whether the payment was for either reason.

I think when rewarding halves and those ASICs come online, the price will dip a little and there will be somewhat of a selloff.  Then I think it will bounce back and go up at least a little.  No sure way to tell though, it's based on what we do, if enough of us sell, it drops, if enough of us buy, it goes up.  If someone has a large sum of bitcoins and decides to dump it, it could cause more people to dump theirs as well.  Time will tell.

I don't think it's a scam, the Secret Service is involved and the company involved that had his tax forms did claim there was a breach.  I'm not advocating supporting this at all, I'm just advocating against misinformation^ until you have proof this really is a scam I'd have to believe it's true.  In fact I don't think you'll even hear anything about it because they don't want any publicity either way.  Why doesn't Romney just release his tax forms to end this?  Is that a bad thing?

I think banks are very afraid of bitcoin, so there will be a lot of pressure to ignore it, which is great because I think it will just eventually lead to their own demise.  New services that provide exactly what Mastercard, Visa, American Express, etc. will arrive for bitcoin, new banks that are bitcoin based, they'll just leave themselves out of the loop.  I think it's great, since for the most part many of them have been very fiscally irresponsible.  They're just slowing down bitcoin temporarily.

You're probably better off not checking off on CPU affinity.  Stop mining, and try 0, 1, 2, or 3 and see which one gets you a better hashrate.  To tell you the truth, I don't use my CPU at all.

@_date: 2012-08-28 22:14:30
Ok, have everyone register their sending address, you don't actually have to block anything, just decline bitcoins coming from certain addresses, blacklist them, make a list all vendors have to abide by.  You don't need to do anything with the miners at all.  Make a million wallet files, shuffle your coins back and forth...and pay a fee each time to the miners which would eventually eat away at your savings until there's nothing left, which also could be tracked as well.  Once the sending address is blacklisted, you can make whatever vendor accepted the payment to forfeit what they received, you can make it mandatory for any merchant in your country (or any country if they make it international law) to be transparent, they have to report their earnings anyways for tax purposes, which, if you have been buying things with bitcoin from legitimate organizations, you'd notice they *are* charging tax and reporting their earnings to the government already.  Slowly but surely, you could narrow down the black market and the people sending those bitcoins to and from.

I don't think you really understand bitcoin or have read into it.  Also, in order to shut down something like bitcoin, you would probably have to shut down all virtual currencies in all video game realms and even the fake currency on facebook for crap like farmville.  Those companies will never let that happen.  You have a very unrealistic idea of bitcoins, and it's not a ponzi scheme.  If you understood money, and the idea that a long time ago, the "people with power" believed that a digital currency was going to replace everything else, you would understand that bitcoin capitalizes on that idea and actually beat everyone to the punch.  It's possible for bitcoin to fail, but in order for it to fail, many other things would have to fail as well.
@_date: 2012-08-14 00:30:50
Just like they can't regulate the ownership of the USD?

What's great about Bitcoin, compared to fiat money, is that it is somewhat traceable, unlike fiat money.  Bitcoin isn't anonymous, it's pseudo-anonymous.

I don't care what anyone thinks, but dogecoin was a joke to begin with.  It really was, how they advertised for it and would tip people like 100,000 dogecoins did not help, especially because they were worth absolutely nothing.  The memes and everything, too much, besides the fact it was just a ripoff of litecoin, as litecoin was kind of just a slightly altered clone of Bitcoin, and pretty much every other cryptocurrency made after the two were just clones themselves.  If more than one cryptocurrency becomes relevant, it will be for control.  There will be a USA based "official" crypto currency for trade in the U.S., and so on.  And if that happens it will be obvious what is being done, to basically steal from the people and force their spending in a certain place.  Kind of like poker chips at different casinos.  Don't fall for them and tell me that Dogecoin was a viable cryptocurrency, when in reality it was only a big joke, and actually undermined Bitcoin and all other cryptocurrencies to begin with.

I was looking at some of the ASIC's and from what I understand the boards these ASIC miners are on, are really just Raspberry Pi's with an ASIC chip.  So if you could get your hands on an ASIC chip, which you probably can't because you have to buy them in bulk, and if you can find the proper board, and you know how to solder properly, and you know how to write your own code to flash the chip and make it run properly, and you know how to write the proper code for the software to run the board as a miner, I'm sure it could be done.  I was looking at this idea as well but I'm just going to stick with what is preassembled that I can buy.  I'm sure there are a handful of people out there that can build one from scratch, most of them are probably in the business of selling those rigs.

Mt.Gox has been suffering from its worst trading lag ever, 502 errors, and at one point some users were not able to log in their account. The culprit is a major DDoS attack against Mt.Gox.

This isn't control over bitcoin, you anti-bitcoin trolls are great.  This is control over your trading company and the influence you have over the market.  Until more exchanges pop up and the lion's share doesn't sit at one exchange, this will continue to be a problem and you know it.  Mt. Gox had nothing to do with the creation of Bitcoin.  Using a means to prevent abuse by hackers is not third party control of Bitcoin.  *See, you don't want a free market, a free market is bad, you guys need regulation.*  This isn't regulation of Bitcoin, it's providing a service to your customers so they don't get screwed.

  **"Silk Road boss paid $80,000 for snitch’s torture and murder.  "I'm pissed I had to kill him...but what's done is done," he allegedly laments.  "Can you change the order to execute rather than torture?" Ulbricht allegedly asked in January. The employee—who prosecutors said had access to private messages sent by all Silk Road users including its boss—"was on the inside for a while, and now that he's been arrested, I'm afraid he'll give up info."  The indictment isn't the first court document to level chilling murder-for-hire allegations against Ulbricht. A separate 39-page criminal complaint claims that two months later Ulbricht ordered a $150,000 hit on a Silk Road user known as FriendlyChemist. The murder was ordered after FriendlyChemist hacked into the computer of a large Silk Road drug dealer and provided Ulbricht with a sample of usernames, addresses, and order information to prove it. FriendlyChemist threatened to publish the data unless he was paid $500,000."**  Nope, hiring hitmen not permitted on the Silk Road lol...

I think that article is behind the times.  It talks about bitcoin having about $110 million in circulation and the price being around $10 in the summer.  A current article would point out that bitcoin, as of right now, is only about 50 cents away from $15 and that there is probably more like $150 million in circulation.  That's a big difference.  I really thought while reading this that this was an article printed back in August, not January 2013.

From what I understand, the mining software is included.  You can mine separately, but they already have a mining pool set up (butterfly labs) and all you have to do is set up an account.  But, they do not run stand alone, you need a computer to hook their USB connections up to that is running the mining software and is connected to the internet.  So a lot of people are getting small netbooks.  For their mini rigs, you get a free Nexus 7 tablet and software that runs the mining under Android (so you can run all your mining through a tablet which has very low power consumption compared to a PC or netbook/laptop).  As for the other ASICs, I'm not sure if they are connected via USB or what not.  You would really have to check with each manufacturer, the information is out there I'm sure.

I completely agree with what you're saying, except that I'm guessing you don't really have an idea of how big the economic business side of bitcoin already is.  Exchanges just opened up across the globe within a few month ago, expanding bitcoin's reach to nearly every major currency in the world.    Internet based businesses that have had their payments blocked by paypal, finally have an alternative.  Wikileaks, Wordpress, and Reddit are among many companies now accepting bitcoin.  Developers have created ways for nearly any business to integrate bitcoin payments.  Online gambling has used bitcoin as a way to get around bans, which is a huge source of revenue into bitcoins.  I think the value of bitcoins isn't really being that inflated by speculators as you think.  You have to take a look at the daily transactions and minus the exchanges, and you'll see there is quite a thriving economy there, and it's only going to get much bigger.  Bitcoin is just starting to catch on worldwide, it will certainly change things for frequent travelers.  Speculators are a small piece of the pie my friend, and when bitcoin starts stretching to services used by frequent travelers, you're probably going to see an explosion if it hasn't happened already by that time.

[This]( is probably the reason why the price just dropped.  Someone sent 1767 to the wrong Bitcoin address, and that person probably sold it all off.  Now everyone is panicking.  Bitcoin back down to $40 because people got scurred?  So someone selling 1767 Bitcoins drops the price a little, all the silk road dealers and others speculate and sell off EVERYTHING.  Boom.  We'll hit $20 then rebound to $60-$80.

I'm sure they'll think of something.  They may require an official registry of your bitcoin send address (not that you can't make more) which along with your W2's and W4's will help them decide how much you owe in taxes.

I was interested in buying bitcoin when it was at $5, I didn't figure out how I could transfer all the money until it was at $10.  I mean the short gain is great, wish I put more in at $10, put realistically I'm in it for the long haul, I think that's the best bet.

Your argument makes the most sense out of any, but doesn't about 80% of all conversions of Bitcoin from other currencies occur on Mt. Gox?  So freezing trading can help stop the drastic drop from $250 USD to what it is right now, at $120 in a few hours.  There are very few exchanges out there that allow you to convert Bitcoin into USD.  Each exchange deals with a different currency.  You make it seem as if all these people would take their Bitcoins and go to an Aussie or Euro exchange to sell them, and that's just not a realistic argument.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:54:08
So you're saying that if we had frozen trading and avoided the dip to $100, which leveled out now at $120, that it would have dipped even further?  It's not a halt on all bitcoin trading, it's a halt at one exchange.

Right off the bat I realized this article is probably way off.  If there is a bank trading bitcoin in Europe which was authorized by the European Central Bank, no one in the world is going to care what our DOJ has to say about it.  If bitcoin falls to zero...well any currency can fall to a worth of zero or near zero.  In order for that to happen at this point, there would have to be something cheaper that was more beneficial to the public that could replace bitcoin.  Businesses are being built and new economic sectors as well living purely off of bitcoin.  Anything can happen but it's like this guy is screaming about the fact the sun will burn out one day.

Freezing trades to stop market manipulation that is going on in the first place by a ddos is market security.  You can't just freeze trading like that?  So what you're saying is we should let the people running the ddos attack run off with everyone's money with their planned attack while we can't access our accounts at all?  I can't access mt.gox at all right now, neither can anyone else, you can't just freeze trading?  Trading is effectively frozen without mt. gox's interference.

This is for butterfly labs products but I think the rest are similar.  Butterfly labs has the software to run the miner on an Android OS, so you can hook it up to mine through a Nexus Tablet (and I'm sure plenty of other devices, but maybe not all).

The European Central Bank already ok'ed the first bank that trades in Bitcoin in France I believe.  No one would care what the U.S. came up with or their reasons to stop it.  In order to make Bitcoin illegal you would also have to make all digital currencies illegal, the digital currency on Facebook for things like Farmville, currencies used in online games, currencies all over and there is just too much money spread between all those things that it would cause more problems than it would solve.  Besides the fact that they'd have to basically shut down the entire internet to stop transactions.  There are even more reasons why they can't and even more for why they wouldn't.  Bitcoin is creating businesses and a whole new economy.  It is actually very beneficial and I'm sure they'll find a way to tax Bitcoin transactions eventually.  Also that guy was arrested mostly because he was imitating American currency, trying to pass off what he had as if it was issued and legal tender of the United States if I'm not mistaken.  That is one of the main reasons they convicted him.

That's what I was looking for :)

I would also like to point out that if you're part of a mining pool, which nearly every that mines is, then you are not responsible for reporting your earnings, the moderator of the pool is responsible to report to the government, and not all pools are in the United States and are not subject to U.S. law.

Well first off, anyone taking out a student loan for anything other than school, is a fucking idiot and should be in jail.  Hence one of the major problems in this country.

Screw paypal and use bitcoin.

I immediately thought the same thing, but how and why?  Unless regular citizens are moving to the black market?  I thought I saw someone say this all started because Mt.Gox was closed for a few days for a holiday and that 3 days worth of buy orders all came through at once rallying bitcoin.  Then I think someone like Glen Beck (someone famous) was raving about bitcoin saying to get in now because it's going up.  Could be a combination of all three things but who knows for sure.

I'm pretty sure if you read through his comments that is exactly what he was talking about, a new model for industry overall, not a new currency.  As much as I love to flout bitcoin, I don't believe what he stated had anything to do with bitcoin or the likes of it.

  "There will be alternatives to the dollar, and this might be one of them," said former U.S. congressman Ron Paul. If people start using bitcoins en masse, "it'll go down in history as the destroyer of the dollar," Paul added.

I just saw another post right after yours stating that ebay is leaving it up to their customers to decide if Bitcoin should be used.  So maybe it disappeared because they've created this open forum?

That may be, we'll have to see, but if they deny refunds and they still don't pump these orders out this month, well they're going to lose more than just money, any credibility still out there may disappear and they'll have to work from the ground up again.

I just opened an account, linked it to my bank account, even transferred btc to my wallet and my mt.gox, it works great for me and it's very inexpensive.  25 cent transaction fee and 15 cent bank fee per purchase, unreal.  It takes 3 days for the money to transfer from my bank, but you get your bitcoin at the price you put in for it and their price is +/- 10 cents of mt.gox.  I'm sticking with these guys and probably using my mt.gox for extra security.  But to login I set it up so I get a text with a token I have to enter.  I think they're great, I have read one or two people having problems in the past, and their site still says beta, but I'm doing fine by them.

That would be impressive if it's true.
