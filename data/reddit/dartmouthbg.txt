Lol to the fact you think $11 free for 25 minute transaction makes bitcoin look any better.  
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:50:05
$0.  There is no cash out fee when you use Gdax.  Transfer coins from Coinbase to Gdax (some U.S. states apparently do not allow Gdax), limit sell for no fee.  Cash out for no fee.  Took a couple days to realize all of this, but it is the best way to do it.  Also, for reference this was over $5,000, under $10,000.

You were excited at the time.  $1,000 price dipped to $900 on the day it was cancelled.  If delivered on the 13th, as intended, it would have been down to $800.  Obviously you didn't re-buy on the 20% discount dip...

Gdax (Coinbase trading site) bank account transfer initiated this morning 01/02/2018.  Hit my bank about an hour ago.  I'm in the US and bank with Bank of America.  Just throwing a data point out that if you can use a bank transfer and not a wire, do so.

When you call for a car, do you call a taxi or a TNC?  If the analogy holds like you suggest, yes, BTC will have marginal utility in the future.  But better tech will pass it and make it look dated.  BTC will only be utilized by those who refuse to adopt new tech and like being ripped off.  Yup, seems fitting.

But many of the new up and coming coins aren't copying Bitcoin technology.  They are using a different approach to the same problem and are gaining traction.  Users migrate to new networks if it provides them faster and cheaper services.  Ask taxis about the large user base when Uber/Lyft entered the market.
@_date: 2018-01-02 01:32:05
I agree Uber is exploitative with regards to their drivers.  That is not sustainable.  I don't even think Uber will be the winner in it all.  It will be the company who builds off Uber's model and also implements self driving fleets.  But the winner won't be taxis.  They will die off or being extremely marginalized.  Taxis tried to implement app rides into their service via flywheel.  It was too little, too late.  This is what I see as an likely to happen with BTC.  Yes, they may add new tech, but reactionary is never as strong as being proactive.
@_date: 2018-01-19 02:15:13
Same here.  ACH with Bank of America both ways for $2-6k and no problems the last 3 months.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:34:59
The two are at odds in terms of what they each believe is the path forward.  A popular exchange,  on the app store blah blah blah, has previously announced they will not support anything but BCH withdrawals.  Now, in a "surprise" announcement they do an about face?  Of course it would tank BTC... and every other crypto that is connected to it.
Worse yet, when people see a coin making gains, they jump on the train.  So the leaked news actually turned BCH into a much bigger gain than if Coinbase had announced plans to support BCH... instead it led to a growing rush followed by this news.  Apparently it had been known for a month among staff.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:20:18
It's not just spamming transactions.  Gdax shows 24 hour volume of 87,909 BTC.  It was 1/3rd that value two days ago.  High volatility is usually accompanied to high transaction volumes.  This is a real issue, and spamming transactions shows it can be compounded.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:09:08
Coinbase is based in San Francisco.  Much better consumer laws in the US, especially California.  There's a risk, but much lower than people perceive it to be.  Someone mentioned Trezors does a good job explaining why to store offline... of course they do, they sell a wallet.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:00:12
Knowledge of Coinbase BCH addition is leaked.  Run up on BCH for last two days on the other exchanges.  Those holding BTC were able to dump at 18k+, then set limit buys at 14-16k knowing this news would tank BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:43:58
Even if the wallet is in maintenance, you can still trade your BTC/ETH/BCH/etc for USDT.  It stops you from sending/receiving, but not from transacting on their exchange.

Posts like this assume every person with Bitcoin invested prior to the last 3 days.  All these new mainstream investors that are driving up prices and are needed for this to be viable are losing money.  Don't minimize their loss.  You end up sounding like an idiot who has no clue what you are talking about.  Then again, a redditor for 3 months tends to throw up a flag.

Worse... shorts aren't available until 30 days after the IPO.  So even if it tanks out of the gates, you would miss it.  Though if it held value until it's first earnings report 30+ days later, excellent options opportunity.

The whole "it may drop 10% overnight" doesn't really inspire the confidence one seeks in savings accounts.  You don't want your money to lose more value.  The risk is too great and the understanding of crypto is limited.  Nobody will see it as a safe haven they are looking for.
@_date: 2018-08-22 21:59:48
Same place it went in the last recession... Savings and bills.  People get laid off, divest to protect their savings.  They don't jump into volatile markets.  That's not how rational decision makers act.  Do some research into recessions and then think about what you would do if your investments in a safe bets were falling or you lost a job.

In an economic crisis where people lose jobs and have no income, how will they buy crypto?  How will they pay for the internet necessary for crypto?  The mobile phone?  Do people not understand what an economic crisis is?

Add on long term capital gains tax for any cash out you plan (depending on whatever country you are in).  Since your finances are in good shape, I'd go $65k for Tesla, $100k for CDs (5 yr is around 3.5%), $100k for down payment, and $50k for taxes (assuming US rate).  Leaves you around 30 or so BTC in case a bull run comes, diversifies your assets, and moves you a bit further along in life.  
If it was life changing money, I'd suggest other things, but think of it as successfully selling a small company or an IPO at a startup.  Enjoy it.

No, anti-money laundering laws have a specific purpose and very simple rules to follow in this case.  The law isn't saying he can't provide the service he was providing.

Solid shit post response I expected from this sub.  Feel free to make you point about USD and oil prices.  We are all on the edge of our seats with anticipation.
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:50:25
My USD didn't drop 25% this morning.  
@_date: 2018-03-06 06:58:24
Well, you might want to leave Norway since they have the same fucking law.  Go away you ignorant troll.
@_date: 2018-03-06 12:29:09
Are all those people imprisoned for money laundering?  You make terrible arguments by bringing unrelated facts into the agreement.  Go back to your shit hole country and pls stay there.  Cute that you won't mention where you live... But keep claiming other countries as if it matters.
@_date: 2018-02-10 17:09:07
Because the stock market tripled in 8 years, followed by a 6% drop, not 70%.  See the difference.  I'm asking the commenter to back up the "system is failing" without bringing in a topic that isn't relevant.
@_date: 2018-11-15 01:04:17
Which is even more concerning for BTC to drop 10%.  Keep drinking your kool-aid.
@_date: 2018-02-19 14:41:42
Well I did say annual growth and Jan 1 to Dec 31 is annual.  Active day trading isn't really annual growth, but I wouldn't be opposed to allowing it.  Just means the bet is a bit messier for verification purposes.
@_date: 2018-02-19 14:15:55
Yeah, let's escrow.
@_date: 2018-11-06 14:48:38
Don't you also provide massive jobs?  Each side isn't taking the world of impacts into account.

A loveble outsider, out to prove everyone wrong... 
@_date: 2018-11-11 21:39:32
Recognizing gains in a speculative market is the opposite of dumb.  Holding on to a crashing investment because of a "belief" is dumb.  My advice, again, isn't to time a market.  It's to diversify his holdings, which includes selling a large portion of what appears to be his only holding.  To suggest anything else is rejects all best practices in investing for the "lottery" mentality.  It's not happening.  YoY is 3% gains for BTC.  He can exceed that in a CD with 0 risk.  Why would you recommend he not diversify?  That's just idiotic advice for anyone with real money.
@_date: 2018-03-05 17:31:45
I respect that, but it's too complex of a situation to just claim financial privacy dictates strip all protection laws.
@_date: 2018-02-19 07:07:50
I'm saying their prospectus is showing 132% annual return like it's the norm.  That's a ridiculous notion going forward, especially if you're limiting your portfolio to only "solid" coins.
@_date: 2018-02-24 05:51:25
No, you all likely hit a specific limit that would likely indicated taxes are owed and worth investigating.  The IRS likely doesn't care about $100 in unpaid capital gains, it's not worth their effort. But someone who might owe $10,000?  Yeah, at least worth a glance.  
The interesting part is what is the limit.  Based on BitcoinTaxes, my trades totaled around $80,000 and I didn't receive a letter.  I deposited under $20,000 and cashed out under $20,000 so it may have something to do with fiat in/out of the account and not just trading volume.
@_date: 2018-02-10 17:05:58
So how is using crypto more convenient than using a credit card? 
@_date: 2018-02-10 17:35:08
So then why would a consumer use it if it is not more convenient?  The reason people use them now is convenience over cash... So... Yeah.
@_date: 2018-03-13 20:41:17
Point me to an MMO that allows you to cash out fiat.  Don't link 3rd party sites.
And HSBC, last time I checked, still required an ID to have an account.  So what are you suggesting regarding HSBC?
@_date: 2018-03-13 15:40:04
Mooning as in 6% above its high in November 2017.  Gotcha.
@_date: 2018-02-19 14:47:31
Yeah no problem. Also look into online escrows you're comfortable with. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 18:12:40
They build that cost into their products.  Imagine the consumer adoption when you tell them there is no dispute resolution and it is treated as if they paid cash.  It's not going to replace credit cards unless similar benefits are provided.  Those 2% fees allow banks to provide those benefits.
@_date: 2018-02-10 15:33:43
People use credit cards because it is a temporary loan, has fraud protections, is almost instant, is accepted almost everywhere, and earns rewards.  If you think Bitcoin will replace that, I'm sorry.
Will block chain technology replace their current processing system?  Most likely.  When VISA or MasterCard implement I'm sure it will be great for them... But it won't be on Bitcoin or any other currently established coin.
@_date: 2018-11-11 20:55:20
Lol, I'm sure people were disappointed when they sold at $20,000 and avoided the gains of it falling to $6,500.  Your investment knowledge is too strong for this sub.  You're treating it like a lottery ticket instead of an investment.  Stop spreading this stupid logic.  It's flawed and dangerous.
@_date: 2018-02-10 16:37:03
Please explain to me how the old system is failing.  And probably best to leave the stock market out of your reply given the 70% crash of Crypto in the same month.
@_date: 2018-03-05 22:05:44
Weird... You're living in it now.  
@_date: 2018-02-10 17:33:47
So a recession?  Which is part of an economic cycle we have known to exist since the beginning of capitalism.  Yeah, not convinced the system is failing or going anywhere.
@_date: 2018-02-19 14:16:21
I'll take that bet.  Let's escrow.
@_date: 2018-03-05 17:08:54
Only on Bitcoin will people defend drug dealers and money launders.  Jesus Christ, you children need to grow up and live in the real world.

@_date: 2018-02-19 14:30:15
I'll let you pick your portfolio, so you can choose any mixture of coins with $1b market cap as of January 1, 2018.  For reference, Bitcoin was ~$13k.  If you went all in on BTC, it would need to hit $26k by December 31, 2018.  1:1 is fine with me, but no "investment" firm is firing off their funds into 1 coin, so I'm not blanket betting against all 30... Unless you want 30 bets, which I'm good with.
Edit:. By 30 bets, it's easier to give odds.  So if you want all of the top 30 independently, I'd want 30:1.  5 coins?  5:1.  Your own portfolio, 1:1.  
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:06:53
So then why compare it to merchant fees of credit cards, instead of cash that everyone can use now?
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:00:44
Still holding, mate?
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:21:26
There is no hypocrisy.  The consumers do not directly pay those fees.  Additionally, using a credit card is an instant transaction.  BTC is asking for me to pay the fee, as well as delay the transaction.  These are valid complaints.
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:40:39
Are you crazy?  Credit cards that take months to settle?  No.. the transaction is settled immediately.  It allows chargebacks as a consumer protection... you don't honestly believe it is a faulty feature?
Good luck waiting in line for 10 minutes for a transaction to clear.  The store will tell you to go fuck yourself and come pick it up later.  Everyone says second layer solutions... well they aren't here yet, so save your bullshit for when they actually work that way.
As for indirectly passing the cost on to the consumer... the price will still be the same for BTC. And you'll pay a fee on the front end.  So you're getting hit twice, you see that right?  Nice try, but you're out of your league and way too far into the hype.
@_date: 2018-03-05 21:17:39
Oh fuck off with your bullshit.  We live in an civil society that has laws.  Just because you choose not to prescribe to them doesn't mean there isn't consequences.  Nobody is forcing him, or anyone else, to live in the US.  Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:48:25
How much do merchants charge for cash?
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:09:42
Lol, so I get no recourse if you ship a shit product?  It's a protection because people on both ends are shitty. 
Let me know how it goes the next time you're in line for gas or groceries and you add 10 mins on to each transaction.  It's not realistic in the real world.  Grow up.
@_date: 2018-02-10 15:58:21
Can I use Bitcoin and pay it back next month, the month after, the month after that?  Bitcoin is competing against cash, not credit.  Address that and I'll care about your link.
@_date: 2018-07-29 19:03:58
Charges dropped != He didn't do it
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:02:15
You sound stupid.  I'd stop responding.
@_date: 2018-02-05 04:44:01
Tether's collapse would result in the collapse of Bitcoin, but there is nothing but speculation behind "there's no USD to back up all of the Tether." Given how much money is in crytpo, it is possible that Bitfinex has enough USD to cover.  We don't know until there is an audit, but the subpoena from the DOJ will get an answer.  
@_date: 2018-02-19 05:05:25
Looked them up.  You must be an accredited investor and they only invest in coins with market cap of $1b (Top 30).  So... pretty much useless since they won't be targeting the high risk coins, and the days of 100% annual growth for the big coins is over.
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:30:09
Lol, go look at online gambling, especially poker and tell them that the US didn't stop it.  It killed tons of sites and it hasn't recovered 8 years later.  If the US does the same, Bitcoin would drop by 50% overnight.
@_date: 2018-07-29 19:35:37
It does matter why they were dropped.  Stop being a troll.

Income is income.  This isn't a retirement account.
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:39:58
Lol I'm glad to hear you paid $2 to process a $5 sandwich so you could feel good about yourself.  You clearly don't understand how real businesses operate in the US.  Chargebacks aren't ruled in the favor of the consumer automatically.  Honest merchants can respond and it will be found in your favor.  You sound like a Reddit neck beard.  Even ended with a ridiculously cheesy sign off.  You keep chucking along, I'll be right here laughing when banks adopt block chain and you scream about how "they can't keep getting away with it!".
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:52:38
Then you're not doing it right.  My friend transferred me cash within minutes yesterday.  The tech is already in place, nobody wants to admit it here:
@_date: 2018-07-19 13:36:47
Usually the holds are related to the balance of the account, which makes sense.  You have $500 in your checking... You deposit $10k.  I would put a hold on it too.  
@_date: 2018-07-22 17:14:21
Up to 10k later that day or next in my bank account.  So, pretty much.  Regular ATM does as well, without the fee.  
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:49:01
I don't use the app, but Chase QuickPay utilizes it and I have no issues. 
@_date: 2018-07-13 01:39:29
There are 4 other coins in the top 100 market cap that use Bitcoin XXXXX.  Add in Litecoin and it has clearly not only worked, but seems like plenty of people give a shit.
This sub needs to restrict people with accounts under a year old and we won't get dumbass responses like yours.  Browse around and do some research before spouting ridiculous shit.
@_date: 2018-07-22 07:52:08
Lol Bitcoin is free money. 
@_date: 2018-07-22 16:50:29
Why would I when you can buy, sell, and next day cash out for free through Coinbase Pro (formerly GDAX)?
@_date: 2018-07-29 19:41:14
Incase one of the convictions is overturned on appeal, the other conviction keeps him in prison.  Same reason you charge him with all the charges you can in one trial.  Efficiency.
@_date: 2018-07-29 19:37:04
Different jurisdiction indicted him for the murder-for-hire charge.  Dropped after his final appeals were denied.  Why would Maryland waste their time when it wouldn't change where he is spending the rest of his life? 
@_date: 2018-07-29 19:54:42
His life inprisonment is a fact.  I can live with that.
@_date: 2018-07-29 21:04:46
Are retarded?  This is a petition for a pardon, which is literally "get off scott free".  No problem distinguishing the two.  Let me know where reasonable punishment petitions are and we can talk about it.
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:31:57
Yeah, until it is instantly processed... this doesn't disrupt anything.
@_date: 2017-10-26 23:32:12
I'm fine with something disrupting the market, but it needs to hurry.  Venmo and bank mobile payments are getting better by the day.  I've done instant transfers (completed in minutes) between different financial institutions.  The new tech would have to be substantially better to take over from what people are used to and already works pretty well.
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:58:46
The U.S. didn't outlaw online gambling, it attacked the ability for online gambling sites to accept payments through the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act.  Banks refused to process payments and the money dried up.
If the U.S. does the same to Bitcoin and U.S. citizens couldn't use their bank accounts to transfer into and out of Bitcoin, then what?
@_date: 2018-07-22 16:16:36
Plenty of credit unions and Scwab accounts refund all ATM fees.  If you use your own Bank ATM, again, no fees.  This isn't an option with Bitcoin and, by it's nature, never will be.  Nobody in their right mind is taking a 10% hit.
@_date: 2018-07-29 19:15:58
Maryland dropped the murder-for-hire charges because his current sentence (life without parole) was upheld.  There was no need to waste public funds and time convicting him of a crime to add to a sentence that didn't involve additional incarceration.  Understand how the legal system works before you blindly defend a convicted criminal. 
@_date: 2018-07-04 06:35:48
Shut up you ignorant twat.  You are the reason this is going nowhere.  
@_date: 2018-07-29 19:54:16
Federal charges and state charges are not filed by the same prosecutor or in the same court.  Maryland is the state court that indicted him on murder-for-hire charges.  Did you follow any of the actual process or just out here spouting for a convicted felon?
@_date: 2018-07-22 17:59:13
No I'm not understanding the advantages of a 10% fee and you're not doing a good job of explaining it considering: 1) I don't try to hide my transactions, 2) my bank account has all the cash I need in it.
@_date: 2018-07-22 16:18:46
Is it a flat fee like regular ATMs or flat %?  If it's $2 for any transaction, this is in line with current ATMs.  If it's 10% regardless of amount, well then you might as well remove them now.
@_date: 2018-07-29 19:02:58
Among other illegal shit that went down on Silk Road.  Fuck that guy and the 43k that think he shouldn't be punished.  
@_date: 2018-07-04 02:23:07
I'm amazed someone who put this chart together even figured out how to transfer crypto.  Seriously, one of the worst comparisons I've seen that provides no actual comparison.  Let me know when Bitcoin is set up to facilitate mortgages, auto and personal loans.  Provides their own ATMs, instead of 3rd parties, and has dedicated staff to talk to when someone hacks my wallet.  Oh wait...
@_date: 2018-07-29 20:55:41
Maryland did not drop the charges until his last appeal was denied by the Supreme Court, meaning he would have been transferred to jail in Maryland had his convictions been overturned and faced another trial.  So no, everything you just said is not what I'm saying.  Exactly the opposite, actually.
@_date: 2018-04-23 14:36:44
Your advantage for Bitcoin is why nobody on eBay will use it... And eBay is PayPal's primary usage.  Nobody really uses PayPal otherwise.
@_date: 2018-04-30 00:32:26
Normal consumer accounts are fine.  Don't be an idiot and run crypto charges through a business account.  It has been widely publicized that no bank likes these transactions through business accounts. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 15:00:36
Shhh... Many people here have no real world experience or understanding of how actual companies operate.  Don't ruin this for them.
@_date: 2018-04-27 14:58:44
Also, ignores the fact that Binance's profits are just taking money directly from the community he supports and wants to grow.  I'd argue their fees are too high if they are already that profitable with that little of overhead.
@_date: 2018-04-19 21:21:40
Honest question:  are you retarded?
@_date: 2018-04-12 00:59:05
I mean you can make it up... the article just did.  This is a lawsuit over inappropriate fees, not fraud.  Words matter.
@_date: 2018-07-22 18:22:56
So the better move is cash out to my bank and use a normal ATM.
@_date: 2018-07-26 13:53:48
Tell this assclown to make a dick bet.  Only way I can take him serious with his bullshit ballot measures and "University" in the Bay Area.

No they don't.  They are a business and can offer whatever they want.  I can't believe you're actually arguing this.
@_date: 2018-04-30 05:31:54
Sounds like the banks have clear terms of service to use their bank, especially with business accounts.  Maybe follow what they ask if you want to use their services.  Don't play stupid.
