Does anyone have a review/comparison of credit unions that are good on security and for working with bitcoin? Ie: supports 100-char passwords, TOTP 2FA, no "security question" backdoors, and no stupid btc tx or tor/vpn blocks?

That list is missing Colombia, Hong Kong, and (to a lesser extent) Argentina.

I read the article (which doesn't mention Colombia or Argentina). But if you just copy the *list* then you'd notice that Hong Kong isn't on it. And the others.

You can use a sip client, so iOS is supported. But if you're looking for secure and/or anonymous voice calls on iOS, you're doing it wrong..

Can I use it with a sip soft softphone so it works on all platforms?
Edit: it supports sip, therefore it supports every phone/OS/toaster that runs a sip softphone client (android, iPhone, Mac, win, Linux, etc). They also boast of a broeser-based web client for no install required calls
@_date: 2015-07-25 14:52:03
Sounds dandy, but why are softphone-to-softphone calls not free? I'll stick to ostel.co

Meh, sounds like a protocol problem to me. Maybe bitphone could pioneer an authentication method sending a signed nonce when initiating a call using a bitcoin ecc key matching an entry on the blockchain with a set of phone numbers owned by the key its also signed with...

Yeah, that's not how tor works. Generally speaking, you need all the relays of a circuit (default 3) to de-anonymize the packets. That's the point of onion routing. The exit just sees where you're going, not where you're coming from.
@_date: 2019-09-14 09:32:10
Even the first scene in the first episode was stupid. You're telling me he spent millions to dominate Tor relays so that he could trace the exit node hosted in a cafe instead of just hacking into the cafe that he already had physical access to?

Is this true? There were tons of coins that they couldn't decrypt. Did I miss news that Ulbricht gave up the passphrase or they somehow broke his encryption? If So, that's bigger news than the auction..
@_date: 2015-11-28 03:38:27
This appears to provide a false sense of security, since it does not restrict and, in fact, freely allows non-tor connections even when this option is used

SIP is a long-standing, standardized, communications protocol commonly used by VoIP software. The advantage being that pretty much every device (iPhone, android, blackberry, Mac, windows, Linux, etc) all have at least 1 (in many cases, more than a dozen) different VoIP apps that support SIP)
