It's a deflationary currency which incentivizes people to hold it. Currency should have a stable value, not declining like the dollar (thank you Fed) or rising like Bitcoin (should it catch on with the public).

The problem with bitcoin is that if a million people decide to start using bitcoin tomorrow morning, there will still roughly be the same supply of bitcoins in the world. That means all the bitcoins are going to be in much higher demand, increasing their value and dropping the price of products traded in bitcoins.
Bitcoin is too inflexible. I'm not claiming I have a magic formula for the money supply, but clearly it can't just be deterministic. It has to adjust and adapt based on the number of bitcoin users. For all the maligning the Fed takes, it does have the advantage of being able to magically create and destroy money. That tool can be used for good (price stability) or bad (inflation to punish savers).
Perhaps the money supply should be determined by a basket of goods or some type of market index. If the demand for the currency skyrockets, more is released into circulation. And if interest in the currency wanes, it could be removed.
Of course this is much easier said than done.

How so? Are you referring to loans? How else would you increase/decrease the BTC supply (excluding the small amount left to be mined)?


I agree that it's not possible to know exactly how much to grow or shrink the supply. But if 100 people are using bitcoins, and then one year later 1 million people are using bit coins, don't you think more bitcoins should be minted to keep prices stable? Otherwise a haircut could go from 20 btc to one ten thousandth of that. 
You're right, the fears center primarily around deflation. I think they are legitimate concerns. I can't wrap my head around how falling prices on all goods all the time is somehow beneficial. When you have an incentive for people to hoarde, they will heed the call! And the more valuable the btc becomes, the more people will hoarde.
So maybe you need to convince me why a deflationary spiral isn't a bad thing. In my opinion, at the very best it adds much complexity to everything (negative interest rate loans, prices changing daily for unchanged goods/services). At the worst, it cripples the economy due to hoarding and lack of credit. 
@_date: 2013-02-02 03:46:46
Well it's the same action, but the motivations behind the action are completely different.
At any rate, if x% of people are savers/hoarders in a system with 0% inflation/deflation, then in a bit coin system it is going to be much larger (&gt;&gt; x). I would assume roughly the same amount of people would be saving and the increase would come mostly from hoarders.
So whatever you want to call it, under bitcoin a much larger percentage of the currency is not 'flowing' in the economy. Economists call this the velocity of money.
@_date: 2013-03-22 20:12:33
you bastard!
@_date: 2013-02-02 07:23:52
With regard to 1), yeah it seems great if you're a consumer. I'll just wait a week and get a haircut for half the price. But think about if you're selling something. People are postponing something they want simply because they will get it cheaper by waiting. They *want* your product/service, but the btc makes them defer. That's a horrible scenario.
No, the MSFT analogy was just to show how you would behave with an appreciating asset. In the analogy, you KNOW the stock is going to increase 10x, 100x, etc. You traveled back with a time machine :)  This is just like we know bit coins will increase in value should btc catch on.
With regard to 3), a currency shouldn't encourage one behavior or another. Just because it punishes spenders and rewards savers doesn't make it any better than an inflationary policy which punishes savers and rewards spenders. Let's avoid imposing morals on the users of the currency. I think price stability is more important than trying to engineer behavior out of people.
When people talk about BTC as a gamble it just affirms my point. If you really wanted to get people interested in an alternative to the US dollar, it should have some btc qualities but also be stable in value. Not one that is like betting in Vegas.

@_date: 2013-02-01 21:22:03
Wait, you're proposing that one extreme is somehow better than the other extreme. Right now, dollars can be created arbitrarily. Bitcoins can only be created at a rate determined by the Japanese guy. Both of these are not ideal situations!
One of the primary functions of currency is price stability. Without price stability, using the currency becomes more of an investment/gamble/speculation, and less of a convenience for purchasing everyday goods and services. I don't want to use bitcoins to pay for a haircut if the price of a haircut is going to be radically different month to month or year to year.
I've personally concluded that the overall money supply has to be controlled. It shouldn't be controlled arbitrarily however. But if it is fixed (or changes at a deterministic rate such as bit coin) there cannot be price stability. For example, if the number of bitcoin users increases 10x in one year, the demand for bitcoins increases 10x but the supply remains constant. The result? Bitcoins are worth 10x more, so a haircut that was 10 bit coins is now 1 bitcoin. No one will want to spend, everyone will hoarde, economy breaks.
@_date: 2013-02-02 00:01:07
If you have to peg your bitcoin loan to a basket of goods, aren't you just begging the question: why isn't bitcoin pegged to a basket of goods?
What you described makes total sense. You want to pay back what you borrowed (plus interest typically, as profit for the lender who took risk lending you money). You want money to be a medium that facilitates the transaction. Bitcoins seem to complicate the transaction.
@_date: 2013-03-28 21:56:51
Lol, you don't get it do you. The early adopters of BTC stand to benefit from the "currency" gaining 10x, 100x, 1000x its value.
@_date: 2013-02-02 07:07:24
I understand your points, and believe me I'm frustrated too with the way the US government handles the fiat money. Although they've done a fairly good job at keeping inflation in check while increasing the money supply, I do fear their tinkering will never end until the whole thing blows up in our faces.
That said, the way you talk about bitcoin affirms my criticisms. You say it's problematic to loan, and I agree. But you can't talk about btc as a legitimate currency substitute for the dollar if you can't make loans with it. Businesses run on credit, especially new and small businesses. A currency that puts roadblocks to lending is a serious detriment to economic growth and innovation.
You talk about btc as a hedge, like gold or silver, against the arbitrary control over the dollar. But, if we're talking about an everyday currency, I don't want it to be an 'investment' with risk potential. I want 1 currency unit to have approximately the same worth as when I first obtained it. I don't want to worry about how the money I got from the ATM is fluctuating in value.
Currencies should be stable, among other traits. I just don't see btc having that property, especially should it start to become more widely adopted. It's going to appreciate, there will be many speculators who hoarde and eventually the thing will collapse like a pyramid scheme. BTCs are a risky investment (and an intriguing one), but not a viable currency substitute.
I don't know how, but the money supply has to be manipulated (up and down) to keep prices stable. If not, the average person will have no use for doing transactions and any day-to-day business with btc.
@_date: 2013-04-11 06:20:26
... and the BTCers are identifying the problem(s) and may very well use these learnings in the establishment of a newer exchange
@_date: 2013-03-20 15:38:55
One of the primary aspects of currency is that it should be of stable value. I don't think that point needs any further backing. It's true because that's what we define as a desirable for currency. And it's true that BTC has been anything but stable over its short history.
A currency dominated by speculators instead of users is doomed, that requires no further backing. The real question is: is that the case for BTC? I tend to think so right now, but I would agree there's plenty of room for discussion. 
The deflation issue is the most important in my eyes because I feel that it is dismissed by BTC true believers and overlooked by BTC novices. It's ironic you'd point out I'm making an argument from authority, and then make an ad hominem counter-argument. All economic consensus aside, transitioning to a deflationary currency would be uncharted territory (that's the best spin I can put on it).
Price deflation massively complicates everyday economic activity. Money today is worth less than in the future. It inherently punishes spenders and rewards savers. But this is the same problem we have in our current economic environment except now we punish savers and reward spenders. 
Currency ideally should not be in the business of pushing people toward saving or toward spending. It should be agnostic of those activities. Currency's purpose is to facilitate everyday economic transactions. When people are being incentivized to hold onto that currency (BTC) or get rid of it quickly (dollars), something has gone wrong.
@_date: 2013-02-07 06:41:26

@_date: 2013-03-06 03:45:04
Currency should facilitate transactions. Stable value facilitates transaction because the prices are changing only in response to supply/demand of good in question. With prices in BTC, prices change not only due to supply/demand, but also BTC fluctuations.
There's a reason modern governments don't use the gold standard. It's so easy to start a deflationary spiral which is death for an economy. BTC suffers from the same problem.
I'll join the fun, hoping to profit on the BTC rally, but I will never take BTC seriously as a currency for everyday transactions.

@_date: 2013-02-02 03:51:12
It's a problem because nobody wants to buy things when prices are falling rapidly. Price deflation can cause an economy to seize up.
Like I will ask elsewhere in this thread, why do I want a currency where a haircut costs 20 btc one week, 10 btc the next, and 5 btc the next? Shouldn't the price of a haircut be stable? Nothing is changing about the way the barber cuts my hair. 
One of the primary desired characteristics of currency is price stability. Obviously, some things should get cheaper and others more expensive. But that price fluctuation should be a reflection of the good's abundance or scarcity, not related to the supply of currency available.
@_date: 2013-03-05 23:27:21
Dollars make sense for spending since one dollar has roughly the same purchasing power as a year ago (less ~4% inflation). 
Bitcoins are already trading at 8x what they were last year. I feel sorry for that person who paid $40,000 for a pizza. BTC gives you incentive not to spend. Economists call it a deflationary spiral.

If something can only be used as currency on a digital marketplace, how does it have any intrinsic value? I think you are confused.
Intrinsic value means value in and of itself. If you take away the digital BTC marketplace, now BTC has no value. Therefore its value is not intrinsic.
@_date: 2013-02-01 22:26:41
I'm discussing this in a parallel thread under my original comment. I'm not saying Bitcoin doesn't have brilliant aspects. I just don't understand how you bitcoin adopters can overlook the fixed bitcoin supply as it relates to price deflation.
A bitcoin economy would be a nightmare for the average consumer. More people join, bitcoins become more valuable. A haircut today costs 20 bitcoins, in a month it costs 10 bitcoins, in another month it costs 1 bitcoin. So people hoarde their bitcoins. Borrowing is out of the question, because owing bitcoins in the future means you're paying back far more than you borrowed even with 0% interest.
If I gave you microsoft stock in the early 1980s and said that was your only way of making purchases, what would you do? The stock is going to double and double again and double again in the coming years, so you want to have as much as possible. You wouldn't spend except on what you needed at the moment. You'd hesitate to purchase as long as you could.
@_date: 2013-02-01 22:34:33
Item a) shows you're treating your bitcoins more like an investment, which is what I originally stated. When people talk about exposure to an asset, they are typically referring to stocks, bonds, precious metals, etc. Nobody talks about exposure to the dollar. Now, the dollar's value does fluctuate (fairly steadily down at ~4% annually), but it's treated more or less as constant by investors. Making people consider their currency as an investment is a big stumbling block to widespread adoption.
Item b) underscores your lack of consideration for what makes a good currency. You don't want to punish those who aren't holding many bitcoins. You don't want to reward people who have a lot of bitcoins. You want PRICE STABILITY. I feel like you're just ignoring this key point.
Consider loans. Why on earth would anyone borrow money in a bitcoin economy? If I borrow 100 bit coins and promise to pay them back in one year, I will end up paying more than I borrowed even with 0% interest on the loan. Why? Because 100 bitcoins in a year would be worth 200 bitcoins today (with 100% annual growth in bitcoin value). By the way, this is why modern governments cannot use the gold standard, price deflation paralyzes credit as no one is willing to undertake such risk.
@_date: 2013-04-01 15:28:07
Yeah, borrowing money in bitcoins is such a great idea. \s
@_date: 2013-02-02 03:55:32
Say I have 100 btc. If I get a haircut today it cost 20 btc. I'll only have 80 btc. But if I wait until next week, when btcs are twice as valuable, I will only have to pay 10 btc for a haircut. I'll have 90 btc in a week's time instead of just 80 btc. 
Let me flip the tables: How in the world is it convenient to have a currency that is deflating? What amount of convenience does that provide? I have to manage my exposure to bitcoin just like stocks and bonds. What about when I just want something simple to buy groceries and clothes? Why trouble every consumer with the conundrum of buying now or waiting to buy later and spending less?
Saving versus spending is a moral decision. I hear arguments that btc forces people to save and not spend. But that's not the place of currency. It's just a medium to facilitate the exchange of goods and services. A currency isn't supposed to preach at me.
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:43:06
That's been my argument all along. It's too volatile. I don't agree with the actions of the Fed in arbitrarily printing dollars but the ability to contract and expand the money supply to keep prices stable has tremendous value to an economy.

Let's remove "technological development" from the discussion because it only complicates things. If prices drop because someone figured out a better way to make a widget that's great, but it has nothing to do with the economics of currency.
Price inflation (something most people are familiar with) is caused by too much money (dollars) chasing too few goods. A bitcoin economy has the reverse problem, too little money chasing too many goods. To compete on the market and sell their products, merchants must drop their prices to convince consumers to spend. But as more people join the bit coin economy, the bit coin becomes more in demand than before. Merchants have to drop their prices again because now it is even harder to coax consumer to spend. And the more people start using bit coin, the worse the problem gets.
AFAIK, there is no way to adjust the bitcoin supply away from it's pre-determined course. That was supposed to be bitcoins redeeming feature, but it is more like its achilles heel.

I don't think you understand. Intrinsic value is something the currency could be used for other than its intended purpose.
So gold has intrinsic value because if people for some reason do not want to use it as a currency any longer, it can be melted down and made into jewelry or whatever. Same with silver, copper, etc.
US dollars have no intrinsic value (other than maybe kindling). BTC definitely have no intrinsic value because they aren't even made of a physical medium.

I don't know what freicoin is but charging people to hold bitcoins obviously would discourage hoarding. But it gives rise to several questions: to whom is the demmurage paid? People who want to leave the dollar due to arbitrary printing and subsequent inflation will now be faced with demmurage fees which can be arbitrarily raised and lowered? Who controls the demmurage rate? What should it be set at?
Once you start messing with the basic principles of bitcoins (like charging to hold it) there is now doubt as to what next stipulation will be introduced.

Stability of the number of bitcoins is unquestioned. But there's two factors that set the 'value' of a bit coin: how many are there (supply) and how many people want to use them (demand). 
So the number of bitcoins can be stable but the value of one bitcoin can fluctuate wildly depending on how many people are participating in the bitcoin economy. Since the supply is roughly fixed, and the demand can only go up, I foresee the value of the bitcoin only increasing as it is more widely adopted.
You could argue the bitcoin value will be more stable once the whole world is on board and there aren't millions of newcomers each week. But getting to that point would be a long and bumpy road, filled with downward spiraling prices.

Look, we agree that prices are the sum of a lot of valuable information. I'm not challenging that. And I also agree that prices should be fluctuating in a free-market economy. But price changes should reflect information about the *product*, not the currency.
If a company develops a way to make pencils more efficiently, I would expect them to be able to sell a box of pencils for less money. That would in turn put pressure on competing pencil manufacturers. If several countries were experiencing a period of growth and needed to construct many new buildings, that would increase the demand for copper. The price would then increase because the information about the new demand is built in.
But what deflation does is distort these price changes. How am I to know if the price of the box of pencils is dropping because of BTC appreciation or if it is from more efficient pencil manufacturing? Now the price changes are a function of BTC value plus all the factors that go into manufacturing the product itself.
Let's not talk about advances in productivity when discussing the viability of a currency. We should strive for a currency that works independent from what is happening with productivity, a currency that allows for price changes because of the products themselves.

A separate matter is how to manage the money supply of some next-generation digital currency. My thinking is that a non-deterministic algorithm is needed. It should weigh several different baskets of goods. If more people are adopting the currency, prices will start to rise, and the algorithm will mint more currency. Obviously, the devil is in the details, but it theoretically gets around the deflation spiral that bitcoin is doomed to encounter.

I was curious. I basically figured out it's a pyramid scheme. I think I might play along because it's still early in the game. But there's no way this can become a functional money supply for average, everyday people doing normal things.

You're right. You could get people borrowing if you offered negative interest. Of course, it has to be enough to make up the difference between what X bitcoins were worth at loan origination and what they're worth at loan maturity (less some for profit to the lender).
So we have a convoluted lending scheme now where the lender pays interest to the borrower. Why is this ideal? Shouldn't we strive for stable currency which allows the cost of a loan only to depend on the risk that the borrower present to the lender? The negative interest loan has two factors: risk to lender due to borrower (tends to make rate more positive) and estimate on how much currency will appreciate (tends to make rate more negative).

I would say that saving is the act of storing a currency so that you can meet a future need, either anticipated or unanticipated. 
Hoarding is storing a currency (in this case) with hopes of future gain from simply using it later when it is more valuable. It's all about intent.
The problem with bitcoin is that it inherently incentivizes hoarding. What's worse is that the more people hoarde, the greater the incentive to hoarde becomes.

The Economist poses a very valid criticism: the need for users not just speculators. I notice that claim is already being dismissed in here. For shame.
People don't want to use currency that is rapidly fluctuating in value. For now, it's mostly up as more and more people hear about it. People want currency that is stable. People want a unit of currency that is more or less going to be worth the same as it was a year ago. BTC has not, does not, and likely will continue to not meet that standard.
You BTC true believers can go on and on about how price deflation is actually a good thing. I think the vast majority of economists would disagree sharply. I think BTC is a huge step in the right direction, but it has at least one fatal flaw.
On the outside chance BTC does become widely adopted, it will be in spite of the price deflation. Central banks seem to be really good at punishing savers and enabling profligate spending governments. So in the end it may be that keeping savings in volatile BTC beats the alternative of increasingly worthless dollars.
