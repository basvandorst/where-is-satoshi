I was just considering them for mining too. 
Is there a better alternative?

I dunno about forgot, but the volume traded has been lower and lower every day it seems. Maybe its just because its before the weekend or something and I havent paid enough attention but it def seems to be slowing down in terms of volume (not necessarily price)

A lot are criticizing your crypto choices and I just wanna say kudos for giving a thoughtful and diverse portfolio. You gave them a nice mix of growth potential and already established coins, and if they invest time into research can make their own informed decision on BTC vs BCH if they want to pick a side.

I will totally accept BTC for holiday gifts, would make it easier to buy stuff for everyone on my list :P

Not but if you ever need some 3D models or non-landscape 2D art made for BTC I am free ;o

This subs frothing at the mouth over BCH is the only reason I knew about it before Coinbase adoption. The constant discussion about it vs other altcoins made it seem more of a threat. Sprinkle on lots of talk about how nobody is adopting Segwit and various other negative posts and I split my investments.
Probably the only reason I invested in BCH is this sub and now feel like I will regret it.
