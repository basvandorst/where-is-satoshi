I think you may be misunderstanding how a semi-log plot works! It is used to show trends in data that may not be apparent with traditional linear axis, or just to show trends a little bit easier. In this case, it helps bc the vertical axis (price) has a much larger scale than the horizontal axis (time).
With respect to your net gain issue...you aren't doing it correctly. The gain from 1000 to 2000 is 100%, yes. But the gain from 2000 to 1000 is also -100% when regarding the original value: 1000. 
Therefore, the net gain is 100-100=0. The net gain has to be relative to the base value, and not the maximum value (which is what you did)!!!
Hope that helps a little! :)

This is a semi-logarithmic scale; it is being used to better visualize the change in Bitcoin price since 2010, since the price seems to follow a (generally) exponential trend and covers a huge range of values--while the time is relatively restricted.
As you can see, the hoizontal axis is increasing by 6 month intervals. That is easy to follow because it is linear. The vertical axis is logarithmic, since the data is exponential, so it uses evenly spaced divisions with successive powers of 10.
Semi-log plots are just a method to show trends in data that may be difficult to see with linear axia.

Oh shit didn't notice that! My bad homie!! That graph is ass. It has but potential, but some one must not be in the 'know'. If only we could explain it to them lol
