They seem to have at least 9 
@_date: 2017-03-04 20:12:01
That's about right, and authority doesn't accept competition, which indeed makes this quite a mystery for them.
@_date: 2017-03-12 17:47:35
I think it's important to remember that the only serious mistake BU has done is to copy the name "Bitcoin".
There is nothing wrong in believing in a different path, and creating a new alt coin as a result of that.
@_date: 2017-03-13 08:41:38
Wait, are BU going for the longest chain?
Sorry, I guess I didn't follow this debacle too closely
@_date: 2017-03-20 19:15:58
Gavin always was fascinated by the idea of mining power consensus.
Roger has sold bitcoin to a lot of innocent, well meaning merchants.
Erik joined the board of McAfee's mining operation.
@_date: 2017-03-13 09:59:08
Are you saying that moving the coins out of bitcoin is the only safe bet?
Maybe this is why Dash is surging. If that is the case, what Roger &amp; co. is doing should be considered an attack
@_date: 2017-03-15 20:42:25
Fuck the rollercoster guy. Lets get on with SegWit and Lightning

Yes, its called greed and it never ends well, as history has shown again and again. How about loosing 5 in order to gain 50 instead?
Some game theory can get us a lot further

@_date: 2017-03-22 14:12:52
No need for that. The developers can improve the parts of the protocol that was meant to keep mining decentralized.
Jihan has no other choice than to follow along, which is what he has been doing until now. Like we all do.
The fact that we are at version 0.14 speaks for itself. Satoshi never meant that miners should force development in different directions long before the protocol was ready
@_date: 2017-03-12 12:45:16




@_date: 2017-03-15 21:09:19
... on hes way off a cliff
@_date: 2017-03-21 09:10:54
Time to be free of this guy.
God hasn't given the miners anything.
How does he know that Shatoshi didn't leave when he realized that stopping people like him would be pretty hard.
Jihan: You shouldn't have invested more than you could afford to loose. We are still at version 0.14
We need to be able to achieve consensus through many small votes, not a few big ones. It drains too much resources, takes too long and tends to lead to war.
You don't need a big vote to make big money. That's what sets Bitcoin apart from predatory capitalism, which we already have in fiat.
@_date: 2017-03-21 13:00:48
So, you suggest we recreate our current crony capitalism using bitcoin?
If there is one thing I know for sure, it is that Satoshi didn't want that to happen.
Bitcoin is a lot more than just "Finally, my turn!" and I'm afraid a lot of people don't see this.
@_date: 2017-03-15 20:53:06
Yeah, and it should have a little vaporware troll lurking in the background
@_date: 2017-03-20 09:03:59
I know. Erik is not lost
@_date: 2017-03-01 12:51:54
Gavin's argument about growing like a garden doesn't make sense to me.
As a decentralized network, growing in a modular fashion, connected by thin standardized protocols, is what provides both scalability, resilience and robustness.
Most software architects has realized this by now.
@_date: 2017-03-11 14:06:13


So did Pablo Escobar
@_date: 2017-03-21 00:01:53
Not the only innovation. There will be more, and if we are lucky, consensus will be achieved through many small votes, not a handful of big ones. That drains too much resources, takes too long, and leads to war.
@_date: 2017-03-20 09:57:16
People saying Core must fork to make changes are wrong. If they deem a change necessary in order to keep this aspect of the protocol decentralized, they can and should do it. This project is under development.
If miners don't like it, _they_can fork away from it.
A proposal like this should give the miners time to prepare for a change, including planning for new hardware.
@_date: 2017-03-15 20:40:01
Cry how?
@_date: 2017-03-13 10:02:56
I think what helpless beginners want to know is, if I have coins on a Trezor and don't touch them until this is resolved, will they still be there?
Btw, Trezor works with electrum. How about just choosing a server in electrum that follows core?
@_date: 2017-03-16 23:00:46
This has to stop. Enough already!

I'm going to steal that one
@_date: 2017-03-20 01:34:49
Those guys are not developers, I'm not sure they really understand the implications of this fork. 
You can't just cut off 90% of the developers of a project like this, and continue on as if everything was fine.
Is Gavin Andresen going to implement all the new BIPs? Is he going to test them all in hes spare time, while maintaining the project in parallel?
And even if he had that kind of capacity, does he really want that responsibility resting on hes shoulders?
@_date: 2017-03-19 16:55:12
Nope, it has an indefinite number of weaknesses, that's how it manages to stumble along
@_date: 2017-03-19 01:08:06
Sounds reasonable. The timing of this debacle couldn't have been worse. 
Right now I'm guessing someone like Roger Ver or the Winklevosses has decided to pull out, and it shows.
@_date: 2017-03-19 16:40:17


People, merchants and what not has to realize that this is a complicated and fragile software/infrastructure project that is going to take time either way, and from that perspective there is no other direction than Core.
If BU manages to convince, it still have to be implemented and maintained by Core.
@_date: 2017-08-23 17:58:41
Something tells me the patent holder(s) could end up in a situation where they become required to restrict the usage of a certain patent, say to prevent privacy?
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:15:34
You have to wonder if it has something to do with running nodes in space.
@_date: 2017-01-05 06:41:34
Using Coinbase may be the right thing for you, just don't forget: The one who holds the key controls the coins.
Also, you don't have to carry it on your phone. Once you have the 12 word seed generated by the wallet application, and written it down, you can delete the App and its files from your phone.
At that point, the only handle in existence that can make your coins available again is the seed. And that is basically what cold storage is.
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:09:32
Which wallet did you send the coins with?
Maybe the server Electrum is talking to is out of sync?
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:08:37
You may be right. The patent I was thinking about actually covers two-way pegs, hence atomic swaps. Very useful to achieve privacy I believe.
@_date: 2017-08-22 23:35:57
I consider the majority of the community to be the defining entity.
SegWit2X and BCH only has miners and a few wallets on board, so it is pretty much an attack using hash power as a weapon. 
The idea that hash power is supposed to decide what bitcoin is always was wrong. It's kind of obvious actually, mining was supposed to do what was most profitable, not change it to become more profitable for them. In fact, the whole system depends on that. 
If you read the white paper, Satoshi doesn't differentiate between miners and nodes, and hes idea was clearly that the majority of nodes should decide which rules are valid.
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:04:36
Rogan should immediately position himself for a tandem paddle. Schiff is at hes funniest when everything seems to be going hes way...
@_date: 2017-08-22 18:43:16
So, the chain with the most cumulative difficulty?
@_date: 2017-08-22 21:08:10
I hope you are right, it's hard to see how censorship will be affected.


The beauty of bitcoin proper, in my opinion, is that there seems to be no legal entry point to break it open. If there is no cracks in the wall around the garden of Eden, the snake can't get in, and that is how conflicts are kept away.
That said, I may be too paranoid about this, and it may not turn out that bad when it comes down to it.
@_date: 2017-08-24 13:17:35
With PoW, Bitcoin provides one vote for each node, in regards to enforcing the rules.
I don't think POS can do that.
@_date: 2017-08-23 17:42:32
Actually, I meant to say timelocks, used for payment networks and smart contracts. I'm not aware of any patents on that.
However, as I understand it, there _is_ a patent on something called two-way pegs, which is used for atomic swaps between different blockchains, and hence used as a way to achieve privacy.
@_date: 2017-08-23 14:34:03
Why don't they just call it Cash while they're at it?
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:46:18
I'm not a lawyer, but using one-way-pegs is patented, so my guess is that if some authority requires censorship of LN transactions, the owners of that patent has no other choice than to deny the use of one-way-pegs, or require anyone using them to comply with that requirement.
@_date: 2017-08-23 17:49:21
The patent I was thinking about actually covers two-way pegs and atomic swaps, which _is_ useful for privacy.
As far as I am aware of, privacy is not a crime. At least not yet :D
@_date: 2017-08-23 14:30:29
That's good news. That means the coins are associated with your seed (private key)
You probably just have to make Electrum work properly. It could be an issue when running from Tails, or it could be a bug in the latest version of Electrum.
As you may know, Electrum connects to online servers to get information about transactions, so it could also be that it connects to a server that stopped syncing for some reason.
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:13:55


What! ... Where?
@_date: 2017-08-22 23:16:11
I'm not sure what it could be, but I would go to the console in Electrum and run the command: listaddresses()
That should give you a list of addresses. First, see if the address you sent coins to is on that list.
If you are sure you got the address from the receive tab in electrum, chances are that Electrum are having problems syncing with the network. If that is the case, the coins are there, you just have to make Electrum talk to a server that is synced, or something like that.
@_date: 2017-08-24 17:09:36
Every argument I have heard from Schiff about crypto has been either too shallow to carry any real weight or riddled with holes.
He never took a very deep dive into any of it, and I doubt he even wants to.
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:06:34
Their only reason to do this in the first place was to "fire the core team" as they put it. That's an attack right there.
We should definitely look into it, because this could just as easily get worse in the future.
@_date: 2017-08-22 23:26:40
They seem to have a patent on all technology that uses two way pegs
Not that I question blockstream or core's intentions. If anyone will provide privacy and fungibility to bitcoin, it is core. No one else is even looking into it as far as I know
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:24:45
Generating a cryptographically secure private key is very complex. Scrambling it like that is absolute not safe. First of all, there is likely to be recognizable patterns in the way you scramble it, and even worse, all the original characters are still there. Every single change you make should at least be independent of any other change, and you have to choose from all available characters, not just the ones already there, _and_ the probability of choosing any of them should be approximately the same every time.
edit: Making a good private key isn't really hard, you can do it by throwing a dice 256 times, but getting the randomness right by using your brain or a computer is actually hard.
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:04:27
I think it's important to distinguish between bitcoin and LN. The use of both LN and sidechains are the property of a US corporation, and as such, will have to comply with any and all US regulatory institutions, whether they want to or not. There is no way around that.
For countries and economies where privatizing the central bank is considered completely insane, this is quite a puzzle to say the least.
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:42:29
I agree
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:16:57
I'm thinking about the patents held by Blockstream corp.
Coins that are tied to a specific company has the same problem really, it's just a matter of time before instructions and gag orders hits their mailbox.
As far as I am concerned, when censorship resistance goes out the window, which it will, there is no point developing this technology anymore. It will have nothing to offer other than being an inefficient replacement of what we already have.
I hope I'm wrong, but I can't really see how.
@_date: 2016-12-05 03:08:51
Seems to me that full nodes with HW wallets could remedy this problem
@_date: 2016-12-05 02:50:05
If I'm not mistaken, the backdoors compromize the entire network, and thereby the trust and ultimately the value/price of bitcoin. Are we at all safe until the majority of miners are running Talos, RISC V + coreboot or some other trustworthy firmware?
@_date: 2016-12-04 16:05:13
I guess there is a difference between regulating bitcoin, which shouldn't be possible, and regulating what you can do with it.
Politicians has to come to the realization that economic value is something that belongs to the people, much like a democratic vote.
Regulating what people can use it for, on behalf of the public majority, makes more sense.
@_date: 2016-12-26 04:57:31
Install Electrum and create an account in there (make sure you type down the seed correctly). Inside Electrum you have an interface for receiving bitcoins, get a receive address from there.
Finally go to coinbase and send your bitcoins to the address you got from Electrum.
Electrum has been around for a long time and has worked flawlessly all along. It is also supported on most platforms. The seed format they are using is also supported in several other wallet applications.
This would be a good start without being too complicated.
@_date: 2017-09-10 03:56:48
It probably has to scan the blockchain for any unspent transaction outputs related to the private key
@_date: 2017-09-10 03:30:53
Yeah, well I don't think the multibit format is supported by other wallets out of the box. Anyway, if you have the raw private keys you should have no problem importing them.
@_date: 2017-09-09 04:41:46
@_date: 2017-09-10 01:22:31
A few weeks ago you had to use the beta version of their wallet site to access the BCash account, but I believe the default wallet site supports it now.
Just make sure you select the correct coin type in the drop down menu, and make sure you don't mix up BTC and BCC when you send/receive coins.
@_date: 2017-09-10 02:30:09
Is that the coin that becomes a store of value after it has been adopted by everyone?
@_date: 2017-09-10 01:19:28
Yeah, that works
@_date: 2017-09-10 02:00:23
That's true, Coinbase will probably make them available, at some point
@_date: 2017-09-10 01:30:08
Must be a typo, you don't receive it, you make one up yourself.
By the way, make sure you get the source from a trust worthy site
@_date: 2017-09-10 03:18:20
It depends on what you are trying to do. A lot of people are just holding the coins long term.
@_date: 2017-09-09 17:19:27
Not if he wants to avoid the pillory. He have to respect the open source rules of participating and reporting issues instead of abusing them.
@_date: 2017-09-09 04:35:44
Probably, if you follow the hodler rules:
1. Be patient
2. Never sell with a loss, ever

Are you sure they will ban everything, maybe they are just gaming the market just to be assholes?
@_date: 2017-09-10 00:31:46


Good idea.
@_date: 2017-09-09 17:23:18
Ver doesn't understand what he has invested in, or the fact that Litecoin already provides everything he wants.
Wu doesn't respect the rules of open source, or why something like Bitcoin can work in the first place.
@_date: 2017-09-10 03:58:59
Yeah, bitcoin is actually perfect for that kind of thing :D
@_date: 2017-09-10 02:58:57
I bealieve exporting the multibit keys can be a bit tricky.
I would first try to open it in a text editor and see if it is password protected (encrypted) or not
If it is encrypted, you might be able to decrypt it with the openssl command tool
Once you have the private key, you can import it in other wallets like Electrum, bitcoin-qt, etc.
@_date: 2017-09-10 20:43:41


Gatekeepers is a well know "issue", and it's going to be especially unpopular in this space, regardless of what I think about it.
@_date: 2017-09-10 01:03:10


Only if he holds the private keys himself though, if not, you never know
@_date: 2017-09-10 03:33:22
Okay, I'm not a trader, so I would probably just try to buy the dips and take some profit on the highs
@_date: 2017-09-09 22:30:14
The PoW algorithm itself doesn't favor the rich. Unfortunately, it favors specialized hardware that can only be produced in China, thanks to how skewed the economic environment has become.
@_date: 2017-09-10 00:43:51
I would suggest Electrum for a desktop wallet. Make sure you write down the seed when you create the wallet, and keep it safe and secret. Also encrypt the wallet with a password and write the password down on the same paper as the seed.
@_date: 2017-09-10 01:06:12


The Chinese people are great. Unfortunately, this is what you get when some old fart is running the country.
@_date: 2017-09-10 21:29:39
Do you really think I would throw myself to the wolves like this to "play to people's sympathies"
I don't care what people around here think about me, I care about bitcoin, and if I don't like the signals I'm receiving, I'm going to say it.
@_date: 2017-09-10 19:54:55
People are trying to make themself the gatekeepers of bitcoin, and effectively called them out with that talk.
Bitcoiners doesn't bow to authorities, and they won't let gatekeepers stand in their way.
I'm quite disappointed by the reactions he got after that talk. Friendly hackers generally doesn't give you 2-3 months to prepare, to say the least.
I have personally been working on projects where a similar attack was conducted without any warning. Two days after the attack, the hacker anonymously provided a link to the exploiting code.
The users were all up in a twist over this, but the developers immediately understood that they were getting help from this hacker. You can't really expect more than that.
@_date: 2017-07-10 06:02:17
Sounds good, thanks
@_date: 2016-07-14 03:14:44
The problem with trying to split the blockchain from bitcoin is incentive. The blockchain is the ledger, bitcoin is the incentive. Nobody is going to mine for baby photos.
