Is anyone seriously saying that Bitcoin is too boring right now? I feel like terror is the current emotion. The market is indecisive, at the precipice of a big move that no one can figure out the direction of.

On it's quality, not necessarily. On it's ability to stick around, yes. Which is exactly why corrupt and/or incompetent governments often stick around seemingly despite themselves

There are billions of people relying on the economy not popping, many whose very survival depends on it. There are a couple million people with btc, some of whose early retirement depends on it. Your delusional if you think these things have equal chance of going to zero. Worse, you're probably over-invested because you don't have a realistic view of your investment.
It's absolutely not time to panic about Bitcoin -- if you invested in it responsibly. But if you went 100x long with your life savings at $9,000, it's too late to panic.
I just implore everyone to support Bitcoin and blockchain however they want and can, but to only invest cautiously and safely.
For those who haven't watched the documentary on Theranos, I would recommend it! I feel like a lot of people here think a lot like Liz did -- i.e., think that chutzpah is always rewarded in the tech world.

Right, but I posit that it is not -- unless it's within a small part of your portfolio dedicated to speculation. And so long as we're talking about investment advice, I think acered24's advice is far better-rounded and prudent than your claim that "there is no escaping" Bitcoin.
If we're talking technology, than obviously your claim is far more interesting. And I actually really like talking about the respective advantages of Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, and blockchain in general. In fact, I currently dedicate a large part of my life working on them. But we need to recognize that what passes as a good argument in one context (technology) is not necessarily an argument at all in the other (investment).

That has to be the most atrocious example of cherry picking I've ever seen. You're picking arguably the single most successful company of our lifetimes directly after the dotcom bubble. Rewind two or three years and pick pretty much any NASDAQ-listed company. Pick for example Sarepta, a company that has been pioneering gene therapies for 20 years -- saving lives of children. Their work was and still is the future, but they still lost 90% over a two month span. Worse pick one of their competitors who couldn't weather the storm and went out of business. Their work is still part of a gene-therapy future, but their investors lost everything.
Investing involves way more than just picking the right ideas of the future. That's called speculation. And it's risky as all hell. I don't think you're an evil person, but hyping people into pushing too much money into a speculative investment is evil. Stop.

I'm not comparing Bitcoin to Theranos. I'm comparing Liz's mentally to the mentality of a lot of people on here.
Instead of getting distracted by my own analogy, let me just ask you: Do you think that what you've said in your post is sufficient evidence to invest in Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-10-09 02:25:57
"I’ll buy my BTC somewhere else, thank you very much." I agree with this, so our argument is a bit moot.
But I still don't think you're giving Robinhood enough credit. I don't think it's a moral issue, it's a business issue. If they end up with a user with $1,000,000 in "marked" bitcoin, both the user and the government will be contacting them. Expensive legal teams will likely get involved. But if Robinhood handles all the bitcoin themselves, there's likely a level of consistency and transparency they can maintain with the government to avoid these type of snafus.

Recent buying pressure was due to people in China buying bitcoin to protect their wealth from the falling Yuan. To see this, notice how ETH hasn't recovered at all from its recent lows and that  the Yuan vs USD chart is inverted wrt the BTC vs USD chart  That buying pressure has evaporated in the short term, and now BTC is up 20% despite waning (in the short term) enthusiasm in crypto. 
If you're a HODLer, you can take this one of two ways:
1) Be scared, because the crypto bear market is likely not dead.
2) Be excited, because the trade war may be the catalyst to push BTC to new highs.

Thanks, man! 
I'm embarrassed to ask this next one: What's the best way to find reputable bitcoin projects on GitHub? The repos have worked on in the past have all been word of mouth from friends.

I'm interested in contributing to Bitcoin applications. Currently, I'm a JavaScript developer (\~2 years of experience) with knowledge of Python. What's the best way to get involved with current projects?
@_date: 2019-10-09 02:28:30
Except it might also go lower.
It's imprudent to try to predict the next bull run down to the day, especially without considering anything beyond proximity to the next halving. What about the current price action? the trade war? the time of year? the stock market? etc.

Have you ever played chess? Linear plans are worse than no plans. Put another way, farsighted is just another word for blind.
Better is to try to describe the current situation as cogently as possible. Don't even invest tbh. If there's actually an investment that's worthwhile, you won't have to argue much for it -- certainly won't have to say things like, "this is probably going to age very poorly but it also could be prophetic ."
Sorry, I don't know why I'm talking like Buddha. "The wheel of the cart follows the hooves of the ox" and shit.

Had a friend who had a lot of his profits seized by the government because someone paid him in bitcoins that had been involved in illicit activity. It's not total bullshit.

I don't understand why this log scale is canon. If you've been investing in bitcoin since the beginning, then yes, this is what your gains look like. But if you started investing later, you should only include the prices since you've invested. Otherwise you're essentially saying, "Bitcoin's great because other people have made money on it!"
It's very nationalistic. Think of all the poor, dumb cowards out there who proclaim that America is the best because it's the richest, smartest, bravest country. They have few merits of their own, so they identify with those who do and take pride in their so-called "group accomplishments." Meanwhile, the rich are totally happy to let it happen because it doesn't cost them anything to give the poor pride.
Meanwhile, the OG HODLers are totally happy to let newbies proclaim the glory of bitcoin, even though it's the OG HODLers that risked and won. The more people who believe they can make money in bitcoin, the more the OG HODLers make.
Edit: Changed "jingoistic" to "nationalistic."

You're not wrong, but my point is that bitcoin has hype in a way that gold never has had in my lifetime. As you say, "Bitcoin gets people who have never managed a portfolio investing for the first time in one of the most volatile markets," which is obviously a function of its hype and just as obviously very dangerous.  These frustrated, outspoken people are probably pushing back against the hype, not bitcoin itself.
I think there's probably an analogy to be drawn to gambling here. There's a world of difference between light-hearted betting back and forth with you friends versus gambling at a casino or playing online poker. You can win doing both, but the latter are literally designed to tilt you so that you'll lose more money.
@_date: 2019-09-27 06:17:56
I think the "out of monetary metals entirely" line of reasoning is interesting. But it makes the implicit assumption that bitcoin is primarily a store of value rather than a bona fide currency. Yes, if you're investing in cryptocurrency as a long-term store of value, supplantation of bitcoin would undercut crypto as a whole. But pretty much every single currency used by mankind has ever used is now worthless. But we keep using new currencies -- not because we necessarily believe they will be worth something in 2000 years, but because they are useful now. So long as bitcoin is useful, it is valuable.

This actually raises a really interesting question: Who is this subreddit for? Is it for the OG champions of bitcoin? or newbies losing money to the hype train? 
I'm not actually sure. I will say that most of my criticism is in defense of the newbies. I've seen a lot of people get wiped out because they got caught in the hype train, and so when I see info that is liable to get a newbie in trouble, I feel compelled to question it.
Re "It's not just a currency, you know?": Can you expand on this?

I think plenty of people who shorted (or at least sold) bitcoin around 9000 during the crash are happy they don't only chart bitcoin on a log scale.
@_date: 2019-09-23 07:58:24
I don't know anyone who has lost their house because they invested in gold. When I Google "bitcoin," the first news articles are usually from propaganda sites a la cointelegraph. Most pro-bitcoin comments I see are "100k by 2022 mark my words ;)" with absolutely no information to back their claim.
I do not go around bashing bitcoin on articles, but I think it's ridiculous to think that bitcoin and its hype train is innocuous. The hype around bitcoin has claimed victims. Of course you should expect them to push back.
But seriously, one of your most outspoken proponents is John McAfee. If this is not a reason to bash bitcoin, I don't know what is.
@_date: 2019-09-27 02:56:22
Not everything is black and white. Just because someone shorted in an obviously bearish scenario doesn't make them a perma-bear. Indeed, a lot of people who shorted around 9000 have already closed their positions around 8000.

This is really dangerous circular logic: "Past performance is the best indicator of future results because, in the past, past performance has been the best indicator of future results."
I like Bitcoin and what it stands for. I also think it's possible it eventually makes it as a currency. But I also think that it's very likely that it doesn't, in which case the sentence above will become, "Past performance was the best indicator of future result until it really wasn't."
By all means, invest. Become a champion of what bitcoin stands for. But please don't ever think that it's a sure thing.

You should never get liquidated when margin trading. If you're trading on margin, you should have a stop loss that will trigger well before liquidation. You should also have short- to mid-term target at which you'll close your position for profit. 
If this type of trading doesn't interest you, that's okay (probably good?)! E.g., if you think there's a good chance bitcoin is "going to makei it", just buy and hold while adding on dips. So long as you're only investing money you won't need, you don't risk liquidation!
@_date: 2019-09-26 19:08:46
I guess you could argue that the chart isn't meant to show off gains, but to be predictive. But then wouldn't it suffice to say, "Hey, bitcoin tends to go way up right after halvings?" What other tradable advice is the chart really showing? And indeed, I am skeptical that we can even count on this trend continuing. Cat's out the bag on this one. People are going to start pricing in the halvings before they happen now.
@_date: 2019-09-19 16:11:15
You bought just as it broke down out of a descending triangle on the 1-hour chart. We're now near the support of the larger summer triangle, so if it bounces up back above $10,000 today, you should be fine for at least a while. If not, you could be suffering down to the $8,000s.
I know this is an unpopular opinion here, but you HODLers need to be at least somewhat cognizant of the day traders. I don't care if you plan to hold forever, potentially losing 20% of your investment in the first few days sucks (especially when you could've avoided it with a little bit of research).
@_date: 2019-09-27 21:57:25
I think you're missing my point. I'm not trying to be snarky and tell OP that he's a bad trader, a la "How do you suck so bad that you get liquidated?!" I'm saying that he's doing something fundamentally wrong if the exchange liquidates him before he stops himself out.
