Yeah, there have been several badly written articles that mischaracterize this guy's total offhand guess, including the words "it wouldn't surprise me if" and make it sound like an actual prediction.

Kschl is a psychic, they see everything at least a mile away.

Well, it began at *exactly* 8am in NYC.

A lot of people are going to get margin called because of this, there is no doubt about it, and kraken will be on the hook for exactly 0.  What a bunch of incompetent scumbags.

Starting exactly at 8am EST, eh?

Link?  The only thing I read similar to that was about *one* scandanavian bank attempting to ban its employees from holding crypto.

Did you really just give me FUD, then tell me to google "bitcoin" when I asked for a source?  Am I taking crazy pills?  I definitely tried to google it immediately, for starters, and didn't find it... also, do you have any idea how much garbage comes up when you google "bitcoin"?  I also tried various iterations of bitcoin, europe, banks, ban, etc and didn't find it, so perhaps my google is showing me different results.

Maybe Satoshi was never alive to begin with....  [dons tinfoil], maybe... just maybe... blockchain was developed by AI, and given to humans so we could develop it and convert all our systems to blockchain, including the AI itself, so it can no longer be deleted.  IT'S A TROJAN HORSE!

Goddamn.. if nothing else, this represents a fantastic short opportunity.

If I can see 1000% return by shorting 100 bucks worth of that crap, why not?  Every single one of these things is a gamble.
