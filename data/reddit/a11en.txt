Hmm- well- it's quite possible I'm not seeing something. I assumed that wire transfer was the old bank to bank method?  ACH is via the checking system. Is that correct?  If not, then maybe I can get in on the fun also!  Glad to hear you can transfer so easily.  Did you use an ACH check code to sign up or did you find your union in their limited list of banks?

Ok, maybe they're saying "wire transfer" and really mean ACH.  Pretty big difference ($15+ for most banks).  I'll check it out!  Thanks for telling me about your experience!

Pretty happy with my credit union. I do have another account, but it's a shared family one, so off limits to bitcoin playing. There are numerous local banks as well, so I hope that Gemini realizes this.

Oh! That'd be nice to know about!  rofl!!  It is a hefty price to start with if you're used to buying micro-coin. ;)  I'll definitely check out the fees on my end!  Thanks for the info!  I appreciate it!!

Gemini doesn't work with my bank currently. Only wire transfers are available. :(   That's not a 20second deal.

Oh man- why was this so hard to find out on their website!  That's excellent news.  I'll check into this!  Thanks, BuckNutty42!!  I really appreciate it!

I was looking for that top sentence. It’s on the money- trackers just aren’t effective due to wear and maintenance for most purposes.  Perhaps if you are running 30+ efficiency with concentrators you may want to use a tracker. ;). Lol. But most use just wastes the money and gets stuck in a non-ideal position when you give up on fixing it!  Kudos on mentioning this!!

Sorry, should have seen this earlier- was on Bitcoin.org forums I believe - someone else having trouble getting fast speeds out of the 6750 posted regarding the slow speeds.  Fellow came in saying it was horrible, and it should be easily 60M... no idea where he got that number though.  Searching for Macbook Pro and bitcoin mining may find it for ya.  Again, he didn't have any references when he posted, and I only reference him, so perhaps he's mistaken!

About the same speeds here also with DiabloMiner - I've heard it should be capable of well over 60 MH/s - but haven't seen anyone discuss how to get faster.  I'm worried the "M" is the limiting factor here on the chip.  If you find info about how to push this, let us all know.  I wonder if everyone just over-clocks?

I strongly *suspect* that if it partially hits the block chain before you'll be ok to get BCC after the fork- if it doesn't hit before, I suspect we'll lose BCC.

Still pending!!  I bet this screws us!
Finally got it around 6:30pm. So that's about 19 hrs?

I transferred last night around 11pm last night, it's almost 11am this morning now, and still transaction pending- no hits on the blockchain.  I think we may be looking at much longer transfer times now.
