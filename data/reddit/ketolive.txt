As an American, it took me a little bit of time learning to distinguish if a man liked Moose Head. You check his groin for antler marks.

This. To me, it's like a slot machine that never runs out of quarters. It's just that sometimes the quarters are larger than at other times.

Looks like you've had a bit too much to think. These blue pills will fix you right up.

Let the price drop to $50. I'll be stoked that my weekly crypto budget will get me a full coin and continue to hodl.
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:15:24
If bitcoin only performs at 1% of its current growth over the next decade, you'll be hodling the equivalent of $160,000 US. That assumes a lot, of course, but how many other investments will see a return like that?

"Hidden wallet" sounds way better than "decoy bag of Jew gold".

What are your feelings on people who say things like, "I forgot my PIN number at the ATM machine"? Hunky-dory, right?

That movie holds up incredibly well to this day. Too bad we can't say the same thing about Jamie Lee Curtis's breasts, amirite?

Hodl and continue to buy more. I have a specific number in my head that fits the definition of "fuck-you money", and $10K ain't gonna cut it.

Nice! My goal is to have half a bitcoin by the end of 2018. That may not happen if the price keeps going up and my weekly BTC budget remains $150. But that's kind of a good problem to have.

I installed the Coinbase app this week and bought $100 in bitcoin at $6800 and then another $100 at $6400. When can I expect to retire?
/s, if it wasn't obvious. Looking forward to many a wild ride before that point, though.

I want to go to NYC just so I can buy a slice, take a bite, spit it out, and start gagging. If it's so great, why can't you sell it anywhere else?

The only bad press is your obituary. And mmmmmaybe sexually assaulting hundreds of actresses.

Buying at 5900 seems smart now. And my concern over the purchase I made at 7800 seems quaint in retrospect.

Pessimist: all I have is a bitcoin nickel.
Optimist: 5 million satoshis! Woohoo!
(I have about the same. Kek hasten the day when a satoshi is on par with a fiat USD.)

Or, you know, some drugs and a $5 wrench ;)

10% at $5800 and 10% at $9300 are very different animals.
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:20:03
Sure, measures lead to countermeasures which lead to counter-countermeasures and so on. And the $5 wrench method (and its countermeasures) also applies to any other form of money. I just have to hope that if someone were to break into my modest apartment, they would be more interested in the TV and PS4 than some weird looking USB stick.
