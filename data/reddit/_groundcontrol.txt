How the fuck was that unbiased? I bet you 99/100 people can identify what side of the debate this guy is supports.

Well, you sure scaled it up ^^^huehuehuehu
I get how the term is use. The point I was trying to make is that relative to other crypto btc has been reeeally slow in increasing its capacity. I completely understand that new features are coming "soon", but they have been coming soon for years now and its pretty reasonable to doubt that they are coming at all. I get that is not technically correct, but I honestly dont know if there exists a better term for what I meant than "has shown to scale better". Again, open to suggestions

Man, I get the professional term of scalability. You dont have to explain it in a condescending dickish way for the third time.
Maket cap doesent really say much though, transactions say a whole lot more in terms of capacity. AFAIK it takes the same amount of power to transfer a small and a large sum. And right now etc has twice the transactions with 1/30th of the fee.
I completely understand the btc-arguments. Higher fees now while a scalable solution is being worked on. But its been worked on for a really long time with close to nothing to show for it. Meanwhile other coins show a vast increase in capacity. I understand the btc-argument, but its just more likely that coins which have shown to increase capacity is closer to scaling than coins that show no increase.

Which is weird because the average fee is now 24.4 USD. Median is 18.82 USD.

Eth has about twice the amount of transactions and 1/30th of the fee. See

This has to be the most salty anti-bch post ive ever seen
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:19:15
While I have no comment on the words meaning in IT, I would argue that "scaling" is used as a laymans term. There is probably a better word for it though
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:33:22
Any thread about BCH in and you basically have to scroll down 2-3 pages of "BCH SHILL AMIRITE??" before you get to the actual comments. Like you have to get paid to have a different opinion. Thats not the case in r/btc
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:45:20


What? It has more transactions than btc, is has less fees. It can process vastly more transactions with less power. This is called scaling.

I actually clicked on your name to see if you are being this way to everyone. Seems that you are.


Try being nicer man. Makes things easier
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:47:31
Kinda weird reasoning though. Both /bitcoin and /btc is a sub mainly dedicated to bitcoin legacy and bitcoin cash. Using "because is a sub about BTC and not BCH" as an argument that should go both ways. Not support one side.

I thought the "store of  value" thing was just a meme. What the point of having your savings in a different coin when you can just have both of them in ltc?
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:30:39
So what do you call something that partially scale?
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:38:31
So you telling me that there is no word for a system than scales 99%?
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:39:22
His summary is basically btc is long term with small problems now. Bitcoin cash is short term with huge problems later. With the only real argument being that "bigger blocks are bad", and that bitcoin legacy is "working on" a solution.
Regardless of which side you support, everyone can see this is not a unbiased overview.

You are legitimately the first person to do the major tom thing. Ive been waiting a long time. Thanks
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:53:31
So what we are really arguing about, is that I used the term "scale" wrongly? Even though wiki says the term is generally difficult to define.
Not sure there is any other word for "has shown to increase its capacity over time relative to demand", other than scale. Suggestions?
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:36:25
Not sure I understand this. All transactions have the same fee. You thinking about trade commission?
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:15:09
Not sure i quite follow. Because has rules to follow. Which AFAIK involves banning most pro-bch stuff, this is better?
I was gonna call you out on being anti-btc, but man does their front page suggest otherwise atm.

Needs more meme-lines
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:46:17
But isnt network capacity steadily improving all over the board? Im not advocating for 1000GB blocks, but I dont see the downside of a 3x-4x increase?
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:25:37
Why was big blocking a mistake?
