I've got a feeling the DAO attacker and the Bitfinex hacker are the same person.

Why does Bitfinex still say "Today..." on their  page?

**Tell us briefly about the speaker: Occupation? Honors or distinctions? Recent work? Why are you recommending them?**
Andreas is a technologist and a pacifist. He is a serial tech-entrepreneur who has launched businesses in London, New York, and California. He has earned degrees in Computer Science and Data Communications and Distributed Systems from UCL. He has the ability to make complex subjects easy to understand. He brings insights and identifies underlying principles and connections between different topics. More than 200 of his articles have been published in print and syndicated worldwide.
I am recommending Andreas because the world will benefit from hearing him give a talk on such an amazing, inspiring, credible, worldwide platform like TED.
**Have you heard this person speak publicly? If so, where?**
Hopefully, I will see Andreas speak soon. I have watched his videos many times, and would very much enjoy meeting him and hearing him speak live.
**Please describe this person's speaking style.**
Andreas is passionate and focused when speaking to an audience. He peppers his talk with pleasant, spontaneous humor.
He has such a wealth of information on his subject of expertise that he can speak extemporaneously while drawing from a balanced collection of metaphors, analogies and current events. He maintains the audiences' interest in part because much of the subject matter is novel, and because he speaks with great enthusiasm and intellectual commitment.
Andreas is on the cusp of industry trends and speaks his mind as a true visionary.
**How do you think this person would best fit with the theme of the upcoming TED conference?**
In keeping with the goal of "…seeking to understand what are truly the most significant developments of the last 30 years ... and applying that knowledge to understand what’s ahead," Andreas will fit magnificently with the theme of the upcoming TED conference because he has devoted himself full time to what may be the most important innovation of the twenty-first century.
In my opinion, there are three pillars of digital. They are computers, the Internet, and decentralized networks. Decentralized networks have been amassing for decades and have gained traction. 
The culmination of several technologies in 2014 will likely make it the year that decentralized networks emerge into the mainstream and prove to be useful for a vast array of industries new and old.
