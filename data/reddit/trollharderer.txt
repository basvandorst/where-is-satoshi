Up until you realize that the post was written one month ago. So yes, reddit's "opinion" is neither new or impressive, especially inasmuch as it simply follows MP's tune.

Remember that old discussion?  
Bitcoin dropped almost 50% since then. Berkshire is up over 200k a share. That makes the bet underwater significantly. The message here being, so what if BRK-A is 205300 and 300 BTC barely touch 150k? The odds are still 7:1 in favor of BTC. Sounds legit.

The story Ethereum is trying to push is that up to 100 individuals have deposited over 1k BTC total in exchange for 2000 scamcoins per BTC, rather than taking the open offer for 5000 scamcoins per BTC. In Ethereum world this probably even makes sense, somehow.

I'm making shit up? Look here: 
 
So what's the difference between some seedy btctalk scammer and the USG? That the scammer actually publishes some of the bids? Cool.
What the fuck do you think an auction is in the first place? Next you're going to tell me about secret trials.

You just click on either death or life side and send BTC to address. Seems Life worth is now more than cost

What happened to PSA: USMS tried to be smarter than their breeches allowed, got totally humiliated by MP, now they're butthurt and dun wanna announce the price anymore. Notwithstanding that it's breaking all sorts of laws, because bureaucrat ego wounds and the protection thereof trump any law!
Stop bitching at BitBet. Bitch at the shitty, oppressive, secretive, monstrous totalitarian government of the US of A.

What part of "USMS held a scam auction and failed to publish the winning bid" don't you get?
