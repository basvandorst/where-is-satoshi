Which routine is this from? It's not often I hear a Mitch joke I don't recognize.

Definitely a possibility. Probably even free for small values. The problem is that there needs to be a large amount of starting capital in addresses that the service owns.

People can still pay with bitcoins, but litecoin mining is more profitable, which is why I would bother.

I don't disagree with you, but it is in the case, as you say, "taken to an extreme." All the same problems could and do apply to bitcoin itself. Bitcoin even fairly recently had a major fork. 
The reason I say 6 confirmations is 6 confirmations, whether bitcoin, litecoin, etc, is because you need the same amount of total hashing power and luck to fork them a given amount. It's to the benefit of miners to always choose the longest fork, since it doesn't make sense to mine a block on a fork, intentionally mining an orphan. Therefore there shouldn't be two forks of competing length at 4 confirmations driven by different peer-clusters unless one has 51% of the network, in which case there are larger problems at hand.

I think I know how the hack worked and where it was on the server. I just removed a bad php shell from my own vBulletin forum, and I think it may be a similar hack for SMF. PM me if you want to hear my hypothesis.

I believe [bitcoin-wallet-recover]( may be useful as well. There are more than one "magic" strings that bitcoin wallets use.

Yes, definitely, this was what I was thinking of when mentioning the android app. I do have a question though: what do you mean by generating anonymous addresses? Like some form of scrambler service: funds go in one address, come out a different one?

That network fee is a suggestion, transactions with lower fees are being accepted. Please let your users specify a lower transaction fee instead of auto "correcting" it to .0001 when a lower fee is input.

@_date: 2013-02-22 18:54:46
My point was that 'true' price is what you can sell them for. If you actually thought that the true price was $15, selling them from $16 would be a steal for you.

Any chance of dping the same thing with litecoins too?
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:00:05
Actually, you need the same number: 6. The security doesn't have so much to do with the time of verification as it does the number of confirmations. 6 was picked by satoshi because the percent chance of a successful 6 blocks fork was unfeasibly low. The reason this is only (for reasonable values of block-time eg not 1 block every second) based on the number of blocks is because each block is based on the previous block as well, so it's not 6 times harder to create a 6 block fork than a 1 block fork, it's to the power of 6 harder. (diff^(6))

The hardware, alone, does generate true randomness, but you, trapped in your ignorance, haven't read the link or attempted to comprehend it.

I was only replying to your comment where you assumed hardware couldn't generate true randomness. My suggestion was to read into things before making baseless assumptions. You may have read my comment as aggressive, but maybe that was because you were already feeling backed into a corner by swaits's comment.
Thanks for your kind suggestion as to my table dick flopping, but I think I will keep at it - it is a great deal of fun at parties.

So you'd want the possibility of running the back-end on your home computer, and then having the front end accessible from anywhere through your ip? That's definitely a possibility I hadn't thought of.
EDIT: And a very intriguing one at that. Then there could be an android app for connecting to your home server as well.
@_date: 2013-05-01 05:47:22

This is a gif of squidward from the cartoon, spongebob. In this scene squidward realizes that he is now in the future, and he is overwhelmed. He puts down his saxophone and curls up, wailing "future" horrifically.

Built in escrow services would definitely a killer product make, but it would be tricky to get right. 
As for security, I definitely agree and have had thoughts like that. It would be difficult to get users to trust the service. Any attempt to make things seem open would only do just that. There's no real way of proving to be opensource, because there is no way to prove a certain source is running on the back-end. Either way competition would be a good thing, I think.

By all means, no. What I, and most here, believe is that there is a big future for bitcoin. In the long run it will rise.
@_date: 2013-01-02 17:49:24
The best reason to buy bitcoins is because they are rising in price. Of course there is the appeal of helping a new and truly independent/decentralized currency, but people want to hear how it can help them. Bitcoins are very volatile, and this creates a precedent for potentially large returns (same concept as in stocks). 
That's what I would use to try to quickly persuade someone, but the reasons are going to vary based on who you are talking to.
