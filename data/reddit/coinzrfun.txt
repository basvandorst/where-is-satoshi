I haven't looked into that exchange's policies, but if it requires some form of identification or ever requires that in the future to withdraw funds (perhaps for legal reasons), you're in a pretty tough spot.
If you don't trust its security, I would just use a newly created email account just for your account with the exchange while using your actual name.

While I understand the frustration here and agree by and large with the other comments you posted above, this one I need to comment on.  The Lightning Network concept was published a little less than 2 years ago.  There are now three separate implementations developed for it that only recently reached compatibility in their tests.  This couldn't have happened without SegWit being implemented to fix transaction malleability too, so that could have certainly delayed things.  That's a pretty good timeline so far.  Compatibility is important so people using different versions can transact across them.
But yeah, SegWit adoption should be far higher right now.  Bottom line is if you are regularly transacting in Bitcoin, you should be utilizing SegWit whether you are an individual person using a SegWit-enabled wallet, or an exchange using it to move coins around for withdraws, etc.  It's hurting the network overall to not do that, and companies like Coinbase are part of the problem relating to that.  Bitcoin made Coinbase the company it is today, so they should return the favor in my opinion.  We can't expect or rely on it, but it would be nice.

No problem!  Honestly, there are so many Bitcoin sites out there.  I can't blame you for wondering.  This is the main, open-source development team behind Bitcoin though, so I'd try and help that if I were you as opposed to something else.

First of all, you are trying to get your point across in a rude way.  But second of all, you missed the entire point of my post.  I don't even have Bitcoin on Coinbase.  I just recognize that Coinbase processes a large number of transactions, which are not SegWit-enabled therefore taking up block space.  If they switched to SegWit transactions, it would lessen some of the network congestion right now since there would be more transactions that could fit per block.  But Coinbase doesn't really care about Bitcoin specifically, so it's up to people that do care to make some noise to get them to fall in line to ultimately help the Bitcoin network.

You're assuming that everyone would want to store in a digital wallet.  Digital wallets aren't FDIC-insured.  Banks are able to offer that peace of mind, which I think many/most people would still take advantage of if cryptocurrencies replace local currencies.  It's much easier for most people to have their banks convert things for them and have the banks be liable for any mistakes.
@_date: 2018-05-01 18:07:31
Yeah!  I would assume in such an extreme example of banks completely dropping local currencies for cryptocurrencies, the Federal Reserve would already have been doing the same thing.  Perhaps not at the same exact time, but I think there'd be a shift in all agencies.  That's totally my opinion though.
@_date: 2018-05-01 19:26:59
Haha, true!  I don't keep anything beyond an emergency fund in the bank for that reason.  A cryptocurrency like Bitcoin that is deflationary in nature with lost coins and a growing world population is better than any interest a bank could give.  I think in this scenario banks would forgo giving interest altogether and may even CHARGE you a percentage of your holdings to keep them with the bank.  I know at least BOA would be charging.  Fuckers.
@_date: 2018-05-01 19:41:14
You bring up a great point.  For the scenario of cryptocurrencies replacing local currencies to even happen, cryptocurrencies would have to be seen as actual currencies as opposed to commodities (how the US currently classifies them).  Right now with all of the tax complications, it could never feasibly happen.
@_date: 2018-05-01 19:11:35
The FDIC is mostly funded by the insurance dues of banks that are members.  So if banks are replacing local currencies with cryptocurrencies, then that would flow through to the FDIC as well.  Unless the FDIC wouldn't accept cryptocurrencies as payment, but that would then require banks to keep some local currency on-hand.  I really can't imagine the FDIC would require something like that if there's a clear trend of things shifting to cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2018-05-01 19:07:19
Totally agree if something affected all of America, but it would help prevent things when you control it yourself such as losing your seed, fire/water damage, etc. that would only affect one person.  I think of it like why don't people have a bunch of cash in a safe in their home as opposed to a bank.  It's just an extra sense of security.
@_date: 2014-06-03 01:17:55
I understand that CoinKite wants to accept many crypto currencies as they can while staying credible to reach out to different markets/protect themselves in case one bombs, but this move seems particularly fishy.  Given the small market cap of BlackCoin compared to other alt coins, I see no reason as to why CoinKite would choose them as their third supported coin.  Seems to me that someone paid them off; perhaps the creators of BlackCoin.  Maybe I'm totally wrong and CoinKite is being visionary by seeing the potential of BlackCoin though.  I'll admit I know very little about BlackCoin.
@_date: 2014-07-09 23:28:08
I would definitely still be into it, and probably wouldn't sell any since I tend to try to view my bitcoin investments as sunk costs (helps to remain level-headed during price swings).  That being said, inflation of the USD does exist, so long term, if Bitcoin is worth around the same amount of USD, it's really losing value.  I probably wouldn't look into investing more if that's the case.
@_date: 2014-06-12 22:33:06
That's a really good point.  I suppose if you had this mindset you would only bid at the very most a low enough amount to be able to make a profit when selling immediately.  So that makes me wonder; wouldn't there be a pretty good chance for those people to get outbid?
@_date: 2014-05-31 05:07:34
Hey, thanks!  I had another typo as well, which I will change right now.  I should probably proof-read my writing, especially when they are opinionated statements.
@_date: 2014-05-31 04:36:21
I'm sorry, but I'm getting tired of people putting money into alt coins other than if you are trying to day trade and make some quick money.  There simply is no point to alt coins unless they are significantly different than Bitcoin for the better.  But even then, Bitcoin is ever-evolving.  The concept of a public ledger in the form of the Blockchain is the power behind Bitcoin, and that public ledger can be called whatever you would like it to (Litecoin, Dogecoin, etc.).  The point is, the Bitcoin public ledger is so immense compared to these others that there would be no reason to try and build up other public ledgers at the moment.  I don't agree with the people that say alt coins are good for Bitcoin.  Focus should be on evolving the most used ledger and improving upon it.  All of society can benefit from that.  This is all my opinion of course, so it's no more significant than any one else's opinion, but it makes sense to me.
EDIT: Typos.

So what's stopping you from entering a new address you control each week, then picking yourself as the winner?
@_date: 2014-03-05 08:22:02
Wait, what.  I live a block from there and go to this place often.  How did I not know of these meetings?!
@_date: 2014-03-18 05:01:59
They definitely were accepting it, but it's certainly possible they stopped.  I talked to a worker there a week or so ago.  He didn't like accepting Bitcoin at all, and rolled his eyes when I asked about it.  I think it was the "new" process he didn't like.  Maybe you talked to the same guy on the phone and he pretended like he didn't know so he didn't have to deal with it.
@_date: 2016-12-05 20:57:52
But the off-chain transactions don't translate as revenue for miners, right?  It's only when the administrator of that chain essentially "settles" the payments on the main chain that there would then be a transaction fee.  So miners would only be getting that one fee once settled.  Maybe I misunderstood what you meant here.  Let me know!
@_date: 2016-12-05 20:33:39
What happens as halving events continue down the road though?  If fees for transactions don't go way up, there's not going to be much incentive to mine since block rewards get reduced significantly (even if the Bitcoin price rises a lot).
I suppose you could argue that the single transactions on-chain for the bunches of off-chain transactions could have higher fees, but would that be enough revenue to keep miners incentivized?
That's the main question I see, and would love to hear opinions about.
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:20:16
Easy, sell 1/2, keep the rest.  Or do this proportionally to what makes you feel good (i.e., perhaps only sell 1/3 and keep the rest, or sell 2/3 and keep the rest).
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:44:01
Let me sum it up for anyone not bothering to watch: he says you should buy Bitcoin because it only ever goes up in value.
That's it.  No real justification for buying beyond that, and he says he is hoping people buy into it despite that.
I understand his excitement as he's seen his investment grow in value, but this is totally the wrong approach to try and reach out to people in my opinion.  It comes across like a scheme when discussed like this without any technical analysis, nor explanation for how it can change the current financial systems in place.
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:37:07
If your Ledger is coming any day now, just keep your Bitcoin on Coinbase until then.  What you describe sounds way riskier to me.  Hell, storing Bitcoin on Coinbase long-term (especially if you are utilizing their Vault service) is safer for a lot of people than any other method if they are not too tech-savvy and/or they don't have a secure location to store hardware/paper wallets and backups.
If you still haven't received your Ledger and it gets close to any actual hard fork, then perhaps you explore a different option in the meantime.
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:44:09
Yes, to answer your question, Electrum does support passphrases.  To ease your mind further, I believe most wallets do.  You won’t be stuck only using Trezor’s software is you create a wallet with a passphrase.
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:06:00
Do they not?  I'll admit, I haven't looked into it because I haven't been planning on moving anything soon.  I know 2X doesn't have replay protection at this time.  Is there any conversation you can link me to talking about the lack of this for Bitcoin Gold?  I'd love to read more!
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:33:24
I know people have mentioned the 25th, and the site behind Bitcoin Gold does too, but the actual fork is a specific block.  It's going to happen in a bit over 7 hours at the current rate.
As far as withdrawing from Coinbase, it's an ACH transfer, so it would take a few days for money to hit your bank account if it exists in Coinbase currently and you transfer out.
@_date: 2018-04-24 21:04:19
I'm pretty sure they meant one million Bitcoin would be what you need to join the 21 club.
@_date: 2016-10-24 20:40:50
The issue is if there are only so many transactions that can happen per block, that price per transaction would have to be a significant amount to compensate for the minimal block rewards.
@_date: 2017-07-13 19:04:26
I don't think you understand the technical consequences of not supporting both chains, or not planning to allow to export a balance of one of the chains that won't be supported.
If Coinbase (or any exchange) only supports one chain and both chains end up sustaining markets, your "many BTC" would only exist on one of the chains.  If it really is many Bitcoin that you have, you could potentially be missing out on a large sum of value by only being on one of the chains.
@_date: 2017-07-13 19:24:23
Ah, ok.  I can understand having that viewpoint.  Not everyone would feel that way though, and when you are talking about a financial company who's existence depends on this asset, I would expect a clear stance on what their plan is.  I don't even mind if they don't plan on supporting both or allowing to export one.  I just want to know as that would have an effect whether I continue to utilize their services or not.  If there isn't a clear stance, I feel like my hand is forced to discontinue before this event (since I do want a balance on both chains), which I'd rather not.
@_date: 2016-05-25 03:19:22
Coinbase is just positioning itself in case Ethereum becomes a bigger network than Bitcoin.  They are going to make money no matter what cryptocurrency is at top.  They just need to make sure they support whatever that is.
It's the safe way to play it, in my opinion.  The riskier move would be to remain all-in on Bitcoin.  With big investors, it's no surprise they are taking the safe route.
I'm disappointed in Coinbase more than anything, really.  They are a major company in the Bitcoin ecosphere that has the power to influence the community.  Instead of trying to unite things and improve Bitcoin/move it forward, they are creating more animosity.
Society isn't going to go from trusting its countries' currencies to cryptocurrencies overnight.  Having one, clear cryptocurrency that people are building around and media is reporting on would shorten that timeframe.  Once that trust is established, I can imagine alt-coins potentially having a purpose.  Until then it's just delaying progress towards what I at least see as the most exciting prospect of cryptocurrency: The global currency not tied to any particular economy that everyone uses.
EDIT: Words
@_date: 2017-07-10 21:57:19
I think you go with the economic majority being the real "Bitcoin," whichever chain that may be as far as taxes.
Then the new chain you have coins on would could be seen as income for that year.  But I don't think that matters.  Since it doesn't exist yet and you'd have the coins as they are created, I would think your income is technically $0 at the time you get them since there's no market.  So I don't think you'd need to report it.  However, if you ever sell it, you would treat the whole of the sale as a capital gain since you received it for "$0."
That's how I see it.  This is a great question.  I'd love to hear other people's thoughts!
@_date: 2017-07-13 20:52:23
That's a really good point!
I would still like Coinbase and others though to clearly state whether or not they would support at least an export option if replay protection is developed.
I can certainly see why they wouldn't want to commit to supporting two chains fully until things play out, but it would ease my mind to know that I have the ability to export the other chain's coins (if replay is developed) if they don't end up supporting both.  If an exchange can't commit to that, then people shouldn't store anything at all there.  So a clear stance on this specifically is what I think is warranted!
@_date: 2017-07-18 03:55:16
I thought about that, but I had two thoughts that made me unsure:
1. Doesn't the cost of a sale have to be in USD?  Or can you pay with the asset that you need to report gains on?
2. What if you aren't even selling and you just move 1,000 BTC from an exchange to cold storage?  You still have to pay the mining fee, but it's not a taxable event from what I can see.  Is it seen as a gift from that standpoint for taxes?
@_date: 2017-07-14 01:00:28
That's what I was thinking too!  Here's where I get thrown off though.  I created a test multi sig vault, and the keys don't seem to be the normal public and private key format (like from BitAddress) that can be swept or imported into other wallets.
So while you can export the Bitcoin without Coinbase using 2 of the 3 keys, you have to use their code on GitHub.
I don't have a code base knowledge, so I'm having a hard time understanding that.  But I know that code allows you to send Bitcoin.  I don't think it displays the private keys in your vault though to be able to then input in different chains, right?  I think this code does the sending for you, so it's only compatible with one chain.  I could TOTALLY be wrong, but I'd love to know what's correct.
@_date: 2016-07-19 23:36:17
Let's say someone is telling you that if you give them $100, through their business plan, investment, etc. they can guarantee you'll get $200 back within one month.
You say, "What the hell" and do it.  Sure enough, in one month you get $200 back.  "Wow, it worked!" you think.  Little did you know, the source of the $200 you got back was from 2 other people joining as well after you inputting $100 each, not from the business plan, investment, etc. like you thought.
So you tell people you know to give it a shot.  As more and more people join, it gets bigger, and everyone is happy and cashing out.  Eventually though, people aren't joining at as high of a rate.  Since less new money is coming in, when people start trying to cash out, there's not enough money left in the system to pay out.  That's when the jig is up and the house of cards falls.
