You’re missing my point, and you’re not really thinking about any of this critically but you’re either a troll or... you’re not someone I would expect to think critically about things lol. Happy holidays

hmm... and your account is less than a month old with only pro-crypto currency posts. All I’m saying is it’s weird this fiat currency’s only real value is “whether or not people will pay USD/other National currency for it” and people are being encouraged to buy by “success stories” like this with no details from highly suspicious accounts. Idk to me that sounds like people are invested in this to a point where they need to deploy the “clap your hands or tinkerbell dies” tactics or their investments are gonna fall through even more than hey have and they’re encouraging gullible people to buy so they can either try to stabilize an inherently unstable market or they can trick people into buying to cut their own losses by handing someone else the bag.
You said Doctors don’t have time for reddit. So this one just happened to not have a Reddit account before today and decides “you know where I’m gonna post my success story? Reddit seems like a great place.”  And they’re  gonna use the same Reddit format for essentially every other text post on this site (click bait title, no actual details in the post). 
Keep on clapping, I guess.
