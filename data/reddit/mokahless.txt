Well, they were. Each time they had a crash not below the previous bubble, followed by a cooldown period before the next bubble.
Not sure why calling "bubble" is a negative thing nor why this theoretical person would "give up" during one of them.
If the price doesn't drop below 10k, this would be the first time such a price increase isn't a bubble for Bitcoin.

Lightning does not require funding on both ends - if I am interpreting what you are saying correctly. The channel is funded by a middleman. Nodes are similar to Tor nodes. In order to forward money in lightning, the channel must have the funds in its wallet. The receiving end does not have to move any funds. Not sure if this helps as I'm not sure if this is what you are trying to say.
Also, it is irrelevant if an address has a transaction in the blockchain.

Seriously? In what way? It's literally the worst symbol for a unit of currency.
* The  means in most fonts, it will be much wider than other currency symbols. This poses even more problems when attempting to use it in superscript. Observe:   | 100@ | ^( | 100^(
* The line alongside an S immediately bring to mind "dollar." Bhat has a similar issue with the current BTC symbol. However, it is nowhere near as bad due to a combination of stylistic differences and the Bhat simply not being as well-known and seen worldwide.
* The needless complication of the @ adds additional difficulty with quick writing. And yes, this is important even today. Many shops still hand-write pricing boards. Additionally for pricing boards, see item 1 and issues with space.
* There are additional existing proposals for a symbol, none of which have been adopted. And unlike your character, they actually exist in most fonts.
Now, you may be wondering why I've been so aggressive and dismissive? I was triggered by your condescending title phrasing with regards to "Let's be honest" and "this is the best." It was not phrased as a creative suggestion open to discussion.

The longest period in which Bitcoin has been over a power-of-10 (10,100 ,1000 etc) during a bubble is 99 days and the shortest is 61 days.
The longest from power-of-10 to top was 18 days; the shortest was 2 days.
Given these timeframes, getting out using your strategy during the mania phase of a bubble is impossible.
That said, I hardly expect the liquidity needed to get out a million dollars during a mania phase to warrant the need of OTC.

For anyone unaware, this is called going "all in." OP is suggesting that if you don't go "all in" with zero risk aversion, then you are an idiot.
Going all-in is very rarely a good idea and impossible to predict.
Very occasionally, this leads to success.
The other 90% will result in loss. Either from getting cold feet, or needing cash and being forced to pull out a significant amount at a lower price.
More importantly, a lot of people who put in more than they could afford to lose or didn't realize how much they could lose and commit suicide.

Ok there's a lot to break down in this post. Let's tackle your actual question last.


Exchanges do not pay you. They match buyers and sellers on an open market. They maintain an orderbook of people hoping to be matched at certain prices and these get bought up, causing price movements. The price listed is either the last exchanged price, the current sell order or the current buy order, depending on where you are looking.
So no. An exchange will not "pay you the price." They will offer you a list of buyers who want to buy your coin. Buying into the orderbook with such a large amount, you might get everything at the current price or you might push the price down as you buy, resulting in less.


This sentence has some structural and grammatical issues that make it difficult to understand what you are saying. I apologize if I misunderstand in my response.
There is no reason an exchange would freeze your account under normal circumstances just because you have a bunch of money (and let's be honest, a million dollars isn't really a "bunch of money" if you are trading on any of the top 20 exchanges right now). If an exchange freezes your account or delays you without having any rules or exchange amount limits then they are lying about their liquidity and shouldn't be trusted.


Yes. It is possible. It is not guaranteed. This is the main reason people are buying when they are doing it as an investment.


Based on historical data, this is unlikely. Bitcoin has mainly run in 10x bubbles (as compared to the 10 numbers of previous highs). So, for example, in 2011, it recovered to the last bubble value of $1, before going into a new bubble above $10 ($20-30 at the high).
Personally, I see the likelihood of a $1M bubble as high but I do not see it happening this cycle. Past $1M, I become nervous as to how high it could actually go. This is just MY opinion.


"Millionaire" and "Life-changing money" are two entirely separate things so I am unsure why you are clarifying "Millionaire" to mean "Life-changing money." All you've done is made it so I have to address both.


Financial Responsibility, Fortitude and Fortune.
IF you invest a reasonable amount that you can afford to lose, do not flinch at short-term movements or try to time the market and are lucky, it is possible.
All investing is gambling. Understand what you are gambling on, however. If you don't understand, you are likely to not have the patience to wait out when you need to.
Bitcoin is a long-term bet. You are betting that it will continue to gain in value due to it becoming more used in the real world and to continue becoming better without failing. I believe a $1M Bitcoin will occur in the future, even if it is just a short and final bubble. This is my own opinion. You need to come to your own conclusions and not listen to others.
You honestly need to do your own research and come to your own conclusions and understanding of what you are investing in. Blind investments are not good.


This is different for everyone. as little as a few thousand could be lifechanging money for many. But let's take a look at this in terms of dollars and assume we have two more bubbles left for Bitcoin. Again, these are my thoughts and you need to do your own research and come to your own beliefs and gamble according to them, not according to what I say.
Let's go with two numbers. 2.5M at the high-end \["Fuck you money" ala *The Gambler (2014) -* buy a low-moderate house, an inexpensive car and put the rest into the market at 3-4%. Done responsibly, should last the rest of your life even if you are 20\] and $300,000 \[enough to start a business, go to school or live without worry while trying to find a job\]. My numbers might be slightly higher than most would suggest as I think in CAD but better higher than lower.
I wouldn't bet on the two and a half million with only one Bitcoin, personally. But it could happen.
$300,000 could happen this cycle but in my opinion is dangerously close to the high of the next bubble and if this closeness will be higher or lower is unknown.
OK, you've heard my opinion. I must emphasize again that you need to do your own research and come to your own conclusions.
I also must emphasize that you must come up with a plan in advance. You *will* be susceptible to emotional choices during large price swings and *must* have a plan to fall back on. Your plan must include both an entry strategy (most use a kind of dollar-cost-averaging scheme) and an exit strategy (you do *not* want to regret selling at the wrong time).
An example of an entry strategy might be dollar-cost-averaging an amount in over a pre-determined period at pre-determined times/dates no matter the price.
An example of an exit strategy might be starting to sell a small amount when certain key pricepoints are hit in order to take out money so as to not have regrets as it crashes or regrets if it goes higher. Balancing this will take time as you need to consider your own risk tolerance. A lot of people will "sell 50%" at each of a certain pricepoint. Personally, I will be selling a much smaller percent at a spread of pricepoints as the price goes up past my initial selling pricepoint.
You need to tailor these strategies to you. Researching price movement in the past, learning your own risk tolerance and learning about the underlying Bitcoin technology are all key to making these strategies work well for you.

What's good and bad in our current economy may not be the same for a theoretical Bitcoin economy.
Bitcoin is inflationary, actually, just controlled and decreasing over time until it is neither deflationary nor inflationary. The supply.
The deflation people refer to is because the price is increasing.
So the deflationary effect on the value of the currency in a theoretical Bitcoin economy would be exclusively from permanent funds lost or an increased birthrate.
So that said I wouldn't see runaway deflation of value happening, more a slow and steady one that is controlled by the code and therefore unchanging by people at the top making decisions. Whether or not this would result in a good economy cannot be measured in the same way our current system is. Our values have changed to match the current system (Remember "neither a borrower nor a lender be?" That definitely doesn't apply to our current system.) and our values would need to change to match a theoretical Bitcoin system.

There are multiple opposing opinions here, which surprises me. Mostly due to optimistic vs pessimistic assumptions about the things you haven't told us. However, many details of your situation could change my opinion.
Undeniably, you owe him nothing. Please give the following details for my opinion. Do note, however, that you definitely owe him nothing but what has transpired may affect what I would do in your situation.
* Exactly what did he say when asking and how did he say it?
* Did you maintain contact with each other prior to him asking for it?
* Can you give more details on the "situation" in which he had to sell without giving away too much private info?
* Can you give a brief overview of his personality and how he used to treat you?
* Background of your friendship with him?
Objectively, with only what you have given us so far and the way in which you've said it, it sounds like this is not someone you should contact or deal with. Mix the coins or trade for monero and back so he no longer can watch your addresses and move on. Or wait for upcoming Bitcoin privacy features and move addresses then. Or at the very least, move the coins around a bit.

You don't have to be near the bubble top for it to be a bubble. 
You are in a bubble as long as the price is above what it will stabilize at after a crash. Historically, Bitcoin has hit one significant digit more, and up to 1.1-3.0x that bubble-to-bubble. There is a high likelihood of a crash between now and 30k that could hit as low as 2k and stabilize around 4-5k.
That might not happen. Already I see less mania and panic crashes around minor issues. And this bubble is overdue vs previous trends set. So yes, past performance doesn't necessarily indicate future performance but - markets cycle in bubbles and for a growth market like Bitcoin, this is especially true. A bubble is not a bad thing. Just part of a normal cycle. 
Regardless, in order to say that this is not a bubble, you must make the claim that you do not expect to see a significant downward crash from the current price and that you expect stabilization around this price from now on. Historically speaking, that is foolish. You are either expecting Bitcoin to become stable at a high or you are expecting the $X0,000 bubble to be skipped in favour of the $X00,000 bubble.

They are dealing with it in a sensible way. By ignoring the people telling them to move their schedule forward and do things before they are ready - like 2x. Lightning is currently in test net. In the meantime, it sucks and Roger is taking advantage of that. When you are dealing with the most valuable crypto in the world you do things right. I assume you are unfamiliar with the proper development process? 
Gavin was. He wanted bigger blocks back in the day but didn't do it properly. He went around telling companies that a blocksize increase was an easy and final solution that would be rolled out soon. Perhaps that ordeal is a contributing factor in the Devs who were involved then deciding not to increase the blocksize as an interim measure. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:57:01
Remember [this]( is what happened last time there were posts like this.
Keep a cool head. Everyone should have been expecting a crash since it hit 10k. I never expected it to go above 30k without first a major crash below 10k. Anything is possible but treat a better outcome than previous bubbles as a bonus, not an expectation. 
There is always the "this time it's different" mentality. This time it's because of big money entering the scene in a number of relatively small ways. Don't fall into the trap. Be prepared for a crash at every shiny 10x of the last bubble high.
I'm not saying that this time will be the same but don't go in expecting it to not crash because you could very well be disappointed. If you think you might become suicidal if it goes down to 2-5k, look at the big picture and either have patience after the crash or hedge against it.
2018 is going to be a very interesting year for Bitcoin. This may garner attention like it has never done before. So it is possible it could go up sooner than later but the last crash down below 1k lasted almost 2 years and people then were saying it would be different. But even so, prepare for the possibility of this being *the* crash because historically, there has always been a big crash before the next 10x. Whether it last a few months (crash down from 257) or it last nearly 2 years (crash down from 1k in 2015).

Don't tell me what I believe. Why does an investor invest? Because they believe in the product. Sure, there's people who don't know what it is and follow the herd to try to make a quick buck - these are often people who buy at the top - but I am happy about price increases because Bitcoin has an upper limit and needs growth to reach normalcy. Increases in price are related to increases in attention which are related to increases in people who believe which are related to more pressure on developers/possibly new developers entering the space. 


That's arguable. I'm just going to leave it at that for now. 


See my first comment. With a cap of 21 million coins, the price needs to go up for it to be used by more people. Supply and demand. But it can't go up at a slow incline because there are *people* trading it. Bubbles will happen along the way. Are you new? This "farce, " as you put it, has happened 5 times already in the past 7 years. It's part of a growth cycle and every time it happens, a new group of people learn about Bitcoin. The only way it's not going to happen is if everyone has already heard of Bitcoin or if everyone has the same mindset.

I'm not saying BCH is bad but by forking the chain, taking on Bitcoin brand recognition and getting into the top 10 coins - it could cause issues. A couple of those things, no. But all 4 is something that hasn't happened before. The biggest issue I see here is using the same ming algorithm while not supporting simultaneous mining like namecoin. 
The problem is I have no more confidence in the BCH dev team than I do in the Bitcoin dev team. If I cared enough, I would research both. But instead, I've diversified a bit into altcoins. Actually, now that I think about it, I am interested in that. I should have a look into each's dev team.

I would go so far as to say the claim isn't just dangerous, it is actually a social attack by certain members of a certain cult group. By making an innocuous, positive statement, they open the doors to claiming Bitcoin is ONLY digital gold. You can't deny Bitcoin acts as the best digital gold of all crypto (aka store of value) so the argument (not always straightforwardly stated) is along the lines of let Bitcoin do what it does best and other coins do what they do best. This argument diminishes the aggressiveness and allows misleading a different group of people who were immune to the Trump/Ver-style attacks (say something false often enough and it becomes truth to a significant amount of people aka be loud and stick to talking points based on false logic).
I've seen posts of Bitcoin supporters accepting the falsity that Bitcoin cannot be used as a means of exchange instead touting its use as "digital gold." Observe the usage timeframe spikes:  [  [  and compare to certain other events.
The whole argument relies on the idea that somehow because a group of open-source developers who properly test things before putting them into production won't compromise on that, then they must not be planning to continue developing Bitcoin.
Ironically, this is the same argument used against all new technologies. Due to current infrastructure and the current state of a technology - that is still being developed and worked on - not being sufficient for the future needs, said new technology can't possibly succeed.

Theoretically, it doesn't matter. Smaller transactions (relative depending on the average amount of coins "staked" by lightning node runners) could be done off-chain with a single transaction to open and a single to close. This means a lot of transactions can be done with the size of 2. How many? Estimates vary wildly as this hasn't been done before but it will be enough to be significant.
Fees theoretically should be low for lightning network users because the entry point is low - you just have to be able to run a full node and have some balance of Bitcoin. Just thinking out loud, but it seems lightning fees will likely scale upwards with the value transacted.
This theoretically should loop around and cause a drop in the number of on-chain transactions and shrink how much the blocks are filled, allowing fees on-chain to also be cheaper.
This is my own theory based on my knowledge of the lightning network. It's something that hasn't really been tested at scale before so - exciting times.

The "worry" isn't that we can generate keys sequentially with a theoretical quantum computer. The worry is that it might be possible to reverse a single key. The worry is the theoretical possibly of breaking the encryption, not brute forcing faster.
Anyone who spends from an address ever would expose their public key and, assuming the quantum computer can break the encryption, the owner of said computer could determine the private key by the public key alone.

Dude, it's a standard ATX PCI-E connector. I threw out all the PSUs that came with my miners when I got them because they looked like unreliable garbage. I replaced them with the Corsair RM850 because of the modularity and efficiency.
A nice bonus is with the RM series, I can stick a pci-e connector end in the motherboard spot and short what would be the green and a black to switch it on. Fits perfectly.

the world tacked their currencies to the US dollar when it was still tacked to gold because it was easier. That's part of the reason the Nixon shock was such a big deal and why Nixon had to reassure the world that the US dollar would remain reliable. In effect, and sadly enough, the US dollar became the world reserve currency in a long transition away from gold.

No. I read a different article I found online. Actually, it's that ethereum blog you linked. That said, there's no need to be passive-aggressive with your sardonic sigh. *Sigh. Did you, random person on the internet, do as I instructed?*
I'm actually not interested in typing a whole lot at the moment, which is why I've been too lazy to actually lay out an argument for my case in the comments. Today I am also too lazy, though :P
Anyway, I thought the ethereum blog did a very good job of describing the DOs, DAOs and DACs while relating them to Bitcoin and summarizing why Bitcoin matches a DO, not a DAO (which I am unsure if I agree with or not) and definitely not a DAC.
On a side note, I took a quick look at the DAC section of the wiki page you keep insisting I read. There is a checklist for a DAC. I could only check off 6/10 for Bitcoin. And partially for two more.
I never disagreed with what you copy-pasted from the wiki entry. I simply don't see how it related to convincing someone that Bitcoin is a DAC as it only referenced a DAO.
Anyway, maybe this will turn into a debate when I am less lazy but for now, we both seem to be pretty lazy with actually putting forth arguments in our responses so I guess that's all for now.

"Doomed to failure" is still not a logical conclusion. The internet boom was huge and value was overinflated and mostly based on speculation. That doesn't mean it's "doomed to failure". The only way it would be "doomed to failure" is if it wasn't worth using.
Value by speculation simply means it is difficult to tell where the true value lies.

No. It's actually 50.0 (with an overline)1%.
But as you can see, that is both difficult to show in ASCII and doesn't make sense to a lot of people. 51% easily conveys majority.
To get more into reality though, Bitcoin mining is all about probability. So in reality, having 50-60% of the network only increases the probability of finding enough blocks to be in control of the network.

There is no difference. If scarcity is natural or artificial is irrelevant. FYI, most gold doesn't have real gold to back it. It is all manipulated today so... gold is also artificially scarce, except in an unpredictable way, except to insiders.

Name me a company that accepts "email money transfer" as a payment method.
That is not relevant. For most companies, you either pay by giving them your credit/debit card information or paypal. Sometimes a nice company will accept a bill payment method.
Not sure what you mean by "way too expensive." The expense is on the business (unfortunately, very expensive for those businesses) for accepting both paypal and credit cards and the acceptance isn't going to die down because consumers expect to be able to pay with those methods.

Do a bit more digging, they are both acceptable as a verb, though loaned is more accepted in American English than British. Loaned has also evolved as a verb to refer exclusively to money, unlike lent.

That's 2.55%. On anything below $2.40, you are paying more than square/paypal in fees - except the fees are charged to the customer instead of the merchant, which is unexpected for new users.
Less than a penny or debatably 2-3 cents would be more appropriate. I mean, clearly there is a problem with the transaction fees of this client if people are complaining.

wow. I'm really not sure how to explain the basics of supply and demand to someone like you.


So I live on an island with 2 people and we use about equally scarce stuff as a currency. I have 100 seashells, Alice has 100 purple stones and Bob has 100 green stones. It's about as difficult to find each and we exchange them for food and blow.
Basically, you are saying if we suddenly find an inlet filled with thousands of shells for the taking between all of us you seriously expect 1 shell to still be worth 1 purple stone or 1 green stone? You expect it to be able to buy the same amount of labour from us as a purple or green stone?
Basically, you are saying you think if more people want bitcoins than are selling bitcoins, the price will remain the same?


You are right in that buyers and sellers don't give a shit and this is not on their mind when selling. But what is happening is if more people are selling than are buying, the price will go down because the higher-priced sellers will not be able to sell their coins because everyone will be buying the cheaper ones. The opposite is true if there are more buyers than sellers: the price will rise because the buyers are buying the cheaper ones but also buying the higher priced ones and the price will rise based on last successful exchange.


I'm not sure I understand why you are calling this a "per-coin fee" but I will ignore that and move on.
This is a perfectly valid point and a point that is much debated. What is best as a currency? Deflation? Inflation? neither? Consistent and forever inflation of the money supply is needed for a debt-based system and in a debt-based system, deflation will cause some horrible effects. Bitcoin is not a debt-based system, however.
Bitcoin's idea is to inflate the money supply at a decreasing rate until a fixed supply is reached. We have seen mass increase in price over the past few years because demand has outstripped the new issuance.
Some alt coins have chosen a path of similar controlled inflation but to continue the supply increase indefinitely.
I personally find the inflation and fixed supply of Bitcoin to be an interesting experiment.

You clearly have no concept of scaling. You also have a bad sense of what others assume.
How is the cost of electricity a problem? A problem for who? Miners? do you really think everyone mining and having zero power cost is a good idea?


This situation as you call it has happened several times already, with two major ones.
If a miner 2GH/s of video card mining equipment running 1KW (0.002GH/s per W) and an ASIC device comes to market with an efficiency of 2GH/s per W, is he going to buy a 2GH/s unit and replace his setup? No. He is going to buy a 2TH/s unit and replace his setup. As will every other miner. This "solves" nothing.


Such that electricity becomes cheaper? That makes no difference. It will just encourage a miner to increase his hash rate with more equipment. Everything you are talking about will not change the equilibrium that is eventually reached.
Maybe you aren't stupid. Maybe you are just missing one point on how Bitcoin works. If so, here it is:
Bitcoin mining scales such that the total reward is the same per 10 minutes regardless of total network hash power. Therefore, the bitcoin you make is based on your percentage of the network, not a flat amount. If the network speed increases, you must increase your share until your percentage is the same as before in order to maintain a consistent income.

A quick proofread, note some things I mention are more of a "feeling" of how I think things should sound when I write an essay. So some are spelling and grammar but others are recommendations for re-wording that are more a personal opinion:
Paragraph 1:
First paragraph is good and I like the last sentence but it doesn't flow well, if that makes sense. You've got all the points but it needs to flow together better.
Semicolon in title "Bitcoin; a Currency" : change to colon


Move this to after the sentence "[...]Bitcoin network have to make sure that the transaction has been processed by their 


Seems too informal to me for an essay. Maybe something like "removed" 
paragraph 2:


Many merchants and large companies, such as Tigerdirect and overstock.com, in the United States and worldwide have already been accepting Bitcoin for transactions.


The wider acceptance of Bitcoin over the past two years has even caused US government to start looking into the regulation of Bitcoin and Bitcoin-related businesses.


treats bitcoin as ~~a~~ property and **it** is taxed as such.


Contradicts your previous statement regarding it being treated as property. Perhaps before stating this, explain more how it is treated as both.




I don't understand what you mean here. Are you talking about the price of Bitcoin vs the US dollar? This is different than "collapsing economy"


I'd make the first part "Since Bitcoin is growing in popularity" into a separate sentence and explain how it is growing.


"This would be great" &lt;-- This is an opinion and has emotion. Keep to the facts. Maybe "This would be positive for [...]"
"Soon in the future the United States government" --&gt; Soon**,** in the future**,** the United [...] hmm actually putting "soon" and "in the future" in is unnecessary. Perhaps Just use "In the future," or "At some point in the foreseeable future"


They are not really comparable. If you want to emphasis the Government, perhaps "more powerful than a government-backed currency"


You can manage your own funds within a Bank. Maybe something like, "Bitcoin is to be able to manage, use and store one's finances outside of the conventional banking systems, allowing one to maintain their finances free of third-party interference." Following it with some examples of fraud, fees or banks exercising excessive control.


I think this is too specific an example. Perhaps generalize it with regards to wallet security and how a user should secure their funds properly.
paragraph 3:


Many countries**,** such as China**,** are trying to make it illegal
I kind of lost concentration and it's late at night where I am so I'm going to skip to the last paragraph and make some further comments. I hope I've been able to help somewhat, though. I might be back to add more. If you make a new revision, I also wouldn't mind checking that out so reply to my comment with a new link if you want me to check it out.




I would have touched on this earlier rather than in the conclusion.


For example, the cryptocurrency~~,~~ Dogecoin recently
One thing to remember is that the last paragraph is a conclusion and should reiterate what you already talked about and maybe make another thoughtful conclusive and related idea but it shouldn't be used to delve into anything you haven't already talked about.
All-in-all though, as is, I think you will likely get something like a 70-80% but of course that all depends on the instructor's expectations. My guess is only based on the expectations of the instructors I had in high school and the marks some of my friends got whose essays I got to read before seeing their marks.
One more note: In general, I think some things can be compressed more and that extra space can be used to flush out some ideas and explanations better before moving onto the next topics.

I like it. Upvoted and a half-hearted response to get your discussion thread going.


I see the viewpoint but I disagree with the fees becoming as bad as credit cards. The processing is simple and based on an open-source protocol. There is no limit to the amount of competitors that can come to market, unlike what we are seeing with Mastercard and Visa. This will lead to more competition to negate the effect of these companies coming out of the startup phase.
It also does solve issues. Now, the following are not considered issues by all and some are solved in both cases but hear it out.
Bitcoin allows transactions to be entirely handled by customers, from the point of their end. I don't need a bitpay card to make a transaction. It basically solves "cash-like" transactions that work as quickly and effectively as credit card transactions.
Also of note, key point of your statement:




This is a tough one. The best I can come up with is that Bitcoin does need some loss-risk mitigation. Bitcoin is too low-level for a lot of people still. It's more than just Bitcoin though. Basically everything in computers needs to be streamlined or have some kind of easy solution for:
1. Backup.
2. Security.
These are the two biggest issues I see with consumer computers *all* the time. No backups. Lost all the family photos. Had a backup but my house burnt down. Even money-related things. Someone I know once had a drive crash on them. It contained all the originals for their digital photography going back years. It was their business. If people can't protect the things that have infinite sentimental value, or even things with measurable dollar value, how can they protect their money when it's on the same platform?
As for security, who are you? Here's my password for this thing you need to work on. Oh, by the way, it's also the password I use for everything else. This is an even bigger issue and yet a smaller issue at the same time. I see cases of security breaches waaay less than loss from backups. People seem to be twofold. They'll give you their password to work on their computer because you fix computers (I actually ironically had a guy tell me his password is "trustno1" once) but at the same time, lots of people freak out at the slightest inkling that their computer may have been "hacked" and pay you hundreds of dollars just to make sure.
I guess I basically ended up agreeing with you. But it's not limited to Bitcoin. Hopefully some day in the future, we'll have adapted enough to technology to teach our children about backups and security just like we teach our children about saving and basic banking now.


This is a short one. I quite simply disagree. I think competition among pools will be enough to keep fees down.


That's not really a valid reason to hate Bitcoin but everything has to start somewhere. I say let it keep evolving and don't try to force or control the opinions of the users. Bitcoin can stand on its own. Users come and go.


I disagree with this concept. That seems to be a good summary of one of the reasons many hate Bitcoin. I think it stems from the idea that Bitcoin cannot succeed if it is considered an investment. I'm too tired to try to go into detail but my reasons for disagreeing are similar to those of the previous number.


Bitcoin is a solid concept. I personally see many of the altcoins that do actually validly attempt to solve some issues in Bitcoin at a protocol level to be interesting and good experiments. However, I personally have not seen any advancements that are significant enough to warrant making any kind of switch. Those that do make a significant change- the change is something many disagree as being an improvement.
Bitcoin is built on the idea of decentralization. This can't really be had if changes are continuously being made to the source. It has to be a choice; let improvements be made on the protocol or keep the protocol out of central control.
The part about those wanting their bitcoin to become more valuable is interesting because that kind of thinking shouldn't have a place with Bitcoin because bitcoin is money. And, people are people. It's not something that can be changed and the interactions will continue in the same manner. Let them.


This is actually two points, in my opinion. The first is the misleading. I think this actually did used to be a pretty big issue but now things are better and getting even better in two ways:
1. Safety, security and ease of use are all improving, slowly taking in more people with slightly less tech savvyness than the last.
2. Bitcoin media and promotion in general surrounding safety, security, ease of use and fees has improved to the point of no longer lying on sites such as bitcoin.org and weusecoins.


Transactions are instant. Verification and the ability to re-spend is delayed. I believe the risk to be acceptable however, I don't want to get into details because this is a half-hearted response. I'd love to see some discussion on this though.
@_date: 2014-04-14 19:50:04

By his definition, does that not mean that most currencies in the world are not currencies?
Someone correct me if I am off because I don't know the fine details but aren't all currencies somewhat based on the US dollar? It used to be gold. But it was easier to tack it to the US dollar because the US dollar was based on gold. 
When Nixon changed this in 1971, he assured the world that their basis on the US dollar would still be safe.

Can anyone confirm or deny this? These are some pretty big accusations which basically have the effect of scaring off anyone who hasn't used their account in a while from using their account for fear of being charged after making a deposit.


I interpret this as only taking money that is already in the inactive account and not taking any new money deposited. The idea they would take new money deposited is really bad. I would like to see a statement from them, either as a response to an email from you or in these forums.
As a holder of an empty virtex account, this is a scary thought. I don't want to accuse you of anything but this is the perfect kind of statement for a competitor to falsely make, disguised as a customer to scare away people from their competitor.
**Edit: reread your post. Seeing now you deposited and left money there in February so they didn't do what I thought. Regardless, this is a new change and not informing you seems really bad. I would still like a statement from them.**
**Edit edit: how did I miss this on the forums 6-7 months ago when the change was made? Looks like there were a lot of people leaving and no official statement from them.**
I haven't traded at all since the price was ~880. Seeing this, and after doing some google searches, I might just move over to VoS. I also see VoS currently has a higher volume than virtex and their physical location is closer to me.

The argument is that Bitcoin is not large enough to not be easily replaced. This is entirely incorrect. Yes, Bitcoin is relatively small but the network, usage and investment in the technology and start-ups using the technology is large enough that no one is *going* to replace it.
The technology works, Bitcoin is established. Companies are putting effort, time and money into accepting it and not creating a new competing protocol.
|Is it able to adapt and evolve much?
No. But the protocol is at a very low level. It doesn't need to. The higher level stuff will adapt and evolve around Bitcoin. Not the best example but look at wallets and the movement towards deterministic wallets that happened.
|What if in 5 years we find a security flaw, and all Bitcoins suddenly become worthless because it can't be patched?
That won't happen. The only unpatchable things I can think of are things that if a flaw were found, Bitcoin would be the least of our worries and not the only thing to go under.
|Or, just that some other currency has a feature which Bitcoin can not support?
There is no feature I can think of that both cannot be added on at a higher level and would be groundbreaking enough to cause the people so highly vested in Bitcoin financially and time-wise to drop everything and switch.
There are some people who will say "You can't be certain" and think that the end of the discussion.
I think they are correct of course, no one can be 100% certain. But clearly they are meaning to say "You can't be reasonably certain." I disagree with those people. I think they simply do not understand enough as to what Bitcoin is.

How early is early? I'm a 2011'er, just barely.
For some reason my memory is so foggy leading up to Dec. 2013 that I had to look up some of my bitcointalk posts to remind myself. Ah. My first post on the bitcointalk site included the phrase "I missed the 'gold rush'". As a miner, mine is a mining story.
I started mining in Dec. 2011 but not dedicated. Just with my desktop 6950. I can't remember how I heard about Bitcoin but I know it was on the web and I probably ran into it because I was folding prior to Bitcoin mining. It was January 2012 I happened to purchase a laptop with a 6770m and started mining with that too (again, not dedicated). Got a 6450 for more monitors and used that too.
I know I started with GUIminer but at some point early on, I switched to cgminer. Played with settings. Did all the stuff miners did.
Between late April and late June 2012, I purchased a 5830 second hand for $80 (the guy had like 5 of them for sale. Sold me the used one for $80 but wanted $160 for the new in-box ones. Did not buy any new ones).
In late June, I first used P2Pool. At that point, it was pretty bad. Made 1/3 of what I normally did on the competing centralized pools and switched back real quick. Pretty sure deepbit was my first pool before I went dedicated but once I had consistent hashrate, I chose BTCguild. At this point, I haven't had that moment where I understood how amazing the whole Bitcoin technology is, so I didn't really value it much. That summer, I almost spent all my coin on a laser pointer online. Luckily, I didn't. I spent it on BFL. This actually didn't turn out as badly as it did for most. All said and done, right now, I am even or slightly up from BFL. Certainly not from the first preorder purchase but between the cash purchases, the upgrade and the exchange fluctuations, I have roughly the same amount of BTC directly attributed to mining Bitcoin from BFL gear as I spent on it. The same goes for the cash that I got selling bitcoin because of the time I happened to sell a few. I got lucky with them.
Back to late 2012. At this point, I'd been mining pretty dedicatedly and had made back the amount of bitcoin I had spent on BFL with my AMD gear by, I think September or at least some time late that year. I remember I never got to that nice 1BTC/day but those last months that year, I was doing between 0.25 and 0.5 per day. For two weeks during my exams that December, being busy studying, it wasn't worth my time to get my 5830 back up when it went down. I always think back to that whenever I consider shutting miners down. I recently shut down my BFL gear due to the efficiency and that it wasn't making anything worthwhile compared to what I already had. I ran it for longer than some would though, I think.
I had my moment of realization of how amazing the protocol is after I finally read the wiki more and researched more into how things all worked. I still didn't invest much because I'm not a risk taker. At all, really. I think I had a conversation about the possibility of buying some at $8 but when it came down to it, I had a few hundred mined already and I just didn't see myself investing thousands of dollars in it.
Then the next year the BFL fiasco happened. We all know about that. And if you don't, you can easily find out. As I said before, I managed to get pretty lucky... by giving more money to BFL as it happened, at the right times and the right amounts. Anyway, 2013 was the year I kept paying attention to the upcoming ASIC market. There were so many scams, so many bad companies, some good companies and even a few companies that looked like scams and didn't end up being scams. I should sum it up for that year.
* Invested in KNC product, small-time. First pre-order. Arrived late Oct. and still mining with it. Currently, my received to the address I was mining to (exclusively used for the KNC) exceeds what I initially paid for the device. A return!
* Invested in the KNC Neptune. Boy was that a worry. Delays and bad pricing and the possibility of not getting a refund. I had calculated and prepared a setup for the wattage they promised. I asked for a refund when they tried to make up for their delays by offering a second one to be delivered a few months later for free. I have a house, not a datacenter. Paid in bitcoin, got refunded in bitcoin and actually made a 29.74% profit because of the difference in exchange rate from time of purchase and time of refund.
* Tried to get in on the first USB key miners from a DIY and a group buy. Group buy went well (Avalon). Guy who made the boards? Not so well. Apparently he was well-reputed before his disappearance. Most of what I threw small amounts of money/bitcoin into at this point, I expected to go downhill so I didn't pay attention for months. I finally checked to see the status of this guy who was getting the boards made and all I could find was a thread on bitcointalk full of people saying "he's a good guy" and "he must have had a reason". Well, all I know is that he ran off with $50 of my money.
* At some point, I mined 1000 total litecoins. Not sure if it was 2013 or before but it was all CPU. Sold most of them for not much. Then the price (BTC/LTC) jumped. Managed to sell a few at a good price but not much else came of it.
* Tipped some people. Emailed some people about accepting bitcoin. One guy got himself set up and I sent him some coin as a donation. I checked back a year later and now his website has an address. The coins in his original one haven't moved though. He must have lost the keys.
* Though briefly lived, at one point, between the exchange rate and difficulty, I was making the equivalent of minimum wage per week if I take the total earned in one week and divide it by a standard 40 hour work week. That was pretty cool. Also pretty cool is you used to be able to buy a medium Tim Horton's Coffee a day on a few USB ASICminers. Now it would take nearly a thousand.
* dabbled with the minimum amounts into those Bitcoin investments that were out (again back into 2012 too). Both platforms I used went under and I lost some between all the switching. I did have a single ASICminer share and he was probably the smartest. After the first exchange went down, he managed the payouts of the existing shares himself ("him" referring to ASICminer, not necessarily a person).
* I'll always remember the first time Bitcoin hit $1k. I was in class and we'd just finished our work. I had the charts open on the computer and a few of us watched.
I'm tired now and kind of losing it but to sum up the rest and anything I missed, throughout the past 3 years, Bitcoin made me take a closer look at money, at our banking system, at our economy. I've spend a little more time scripting and playing with Linux because of Bitcoin. I even spent a little more time with some family and friends because of Bitcoin. I don't know any hardcore bitcoiners, but I do know people who find it interesting.
You know, there's a lot of cool stuff I left out and not enough of me willing to take the effort to think about it more and put it all in. So, I guess if there are questions I can be more specific. Or, maybe it was a terribly written and badly ordered ramble.
I wasn't there (for bitcoin) in 2009, 2010 and most of 2011. I guess one of the most interesting things for me as I journeyed through Bitcoin was reading about 2009, 2010 and 2011.
My stance. Bitcoin is an amazing piece of technology. I do not believe those that think something else will replace Bitcoin that also uses blockchain technology because I cannot imagine something significant enough to warrant everyone switch. Nor do I believe those that think Bitcoin will take over the work in the sense of replacing what we already have. Bitcoin is an amazing evolution and will mesh well with what we have now because no one will stop it because of the innovation, the startups and those invested monetarily, emotionally and with their ideas for business and for future uses. Bitcoin may be small but it is big enough that it will always be there.
At the end of Nov. this year, I shut down all my BFL gear. My KNC miner is still running and makes about $5 every week. Or is it every 2 weeks? But when the new, lower nm stuff comes out next year, I'll probably shut KNC down too. I still browse for deals that match my standards for a 6 month theoretical return using a 15% diff increase per target period but most stuff I've found is over after I factor in shipping. It would feel very strange for me not to be mining at all come early next year. My place is already quieter without the KNC gear mining away.

I'll first say I haven't done more than skim the technical part and haven't tried the software myself so I might edit this later but there are some concerns that stick out.
First, why is it using the NY quick draw lottery numbers? This cuts off the "decentralized" part as well as the trust part. Why would we trust those numbers more than some kind of randomness based on consensus during something similar to mining?
Second, it's advertising "don't gamble? be part of the house." How is that different? The house can lose too...
I will read up more on this "burning" and how this idea works later but for now, I don't trust it. Something like this is definitely a great idea though.

I'll counter-bite:


I don't consider keeping a financial system operating well to be a waste of electricity.


I agree. The infrastructure must continue to evolve.


I'll take that in two:
storage space: There is no logical reason for a person to run a full node unless they are mining. Trusting several other servers is sufficient or using a wallet that downloads only the last needed portion of the blockchain are more logical. If someone is concerned with security, they can create their own node at home.
Bandwidth: [citation needed]. You need to back up those claims. Transactions do not use a significant amount of bandwidth besides downloading the initial chain, which is unnecessary for most as outlined above. However, even miners do not use much bandwidth. The highest-bandwidth intensive miners are those who mine on their own local P2Pool node, such as myself. As it turns out, bandwidth is not very significant even then. 


Hasn't been a problem so far. As I said, those who need the full node will be miners and volunteers. It is also likely that any major companies dealing in Bitcoin will keep their own node for one reason or another.
The blockchain is currently about 16GB. Very small. 6TB drives just came out this year. Even if the chain reached 16TB, even a hobby miner could afford it with $1K to spend on storage, *with today's technology.*


I think this is a larger debate on it's own and too much for my response at this time but, well, it depends on how far you take conspiracy theories etc. Certainly if there are none of these theories involved, there is already too much hash power on the network to make that a worthwhile endeavour for a government.


I agree. The infrastructure must continue to evolve.


In any instance that needs a confirmation, it is practical to wait. I feel that the instances you think need a confirmation, don't need a confirmation. Just enough propagation.


I agree. The infrastructure must continue to evolve. This includes Bitcoin outgrowing the causes of major booms and busts currently being experienced.


This was my biggest concern, I think. Again, I agree. The infrastructure must continue to evolve. Services built on top of Bitcoin could certainly provide such a service. Then there are those who believe in a third party. 


I don't understand what you are trying to say here. Either I am misunderstanding your statement or you don't understand how the blockchain works. I feel I am misunderstanding though. Please expand.

you are misunderstanding what accepted means. this means that  it isn't poor writing.

The datacenter is supposed to use last gen first. The next gen should go to consumers. If the max capacitying the datacenter, they'll do about 8 PH/s or about 25% of the network, including themselves, if they were to come online now.
Also not sure where you got your specs from. The initial announcement was 3TH/s @ 2.6KW/h, if I remember correctly and they recently announced I think it was a 10% gain in transistors they could fit on in the same power envelope. Someone correct me if I am wrong, I don't want to be digging through emails.
I'm also using my from the wall power as a baseline: 170W for a Mercury at 137GH/s. Since they announced the power of the new units based on the power of the old units, it means I used it to calculate the Neptune.

I'll paste what I said before.
His conservative estimate still doesn't work out at all. The amount made in 6 months will be far greater than the amount made in the 6 months after that. It will not be nearly enough to make the difference.
If we go by his conservative estimate, we are still talking about a &lt;10% diff jump every target period for that to work. We haven't seen a target period jump less than 10% since May of last year. This isn't even competitive with some of the overpriced mining gear out there.
Edit: I took the opportunity to extend my spreadsheet to include a 1 year estimate just for you (I previously only used up to 6 months because past that is too risky in general and I never based any of my mining investments on more than a 6 month return, electricity not included) and the estimate is that full payback in 1 year requires an average difficulty change of 2-3% per target period.

This is just my opinion but bitcoin faucets should be a thing of the past. It worked when the bitcoin market was not worth much. Now, people just buy it if they are interested. Giving them the amount that is plausable to give for free ( 30,000s) serves no purpose but to frustrate new users who realize they can't use it or even really test anything with such a low amount.
I think you should turn the site into a "Free Bitcoin!" site in the sense of advertising not free bitcoin but the idea of freeing Bitcoin. You can reinterpret that and make it into a site that debunks Bitcoin myths. In addition, people googling to get free bitcoin will instead come away more informed about Bitcoin.

You have just illustrated the reason that Bitcoin is The Coin.
TCP/IP is so flawed. But we still use it and this will never change.
Companies are not saying "let's build a business around Cryptocoins" They are saying "let's build a business around Bitcoin"
It's still somewhat early so if something significantly improved and different comes along, then something might change. But I can't think of what that could be and neither can 200+ developers writing altcoins. Something to cause a shift away from Bitcoin would have to be nearly as revolutionary as Bitcoin itself.

The purpose of a tip is to show support/appreciation for something/someone. If someone gets enough tips, they may make the effort to convert the tip (using changetip as example in this case) to something useful to them. If they don't, or don't expect to, they pass it along. The same cannot be said for the low amount given by free bitcoin sites due to the transaction fees on the network. I suppose, another point for the idea of moving low amounts to off-chain.
The person introduced to changetip, might investigate Bitcoin and see changetip for what it is. A person introduced to Bitcoin via 1 satoshi which they cannot pass along or even more from their wallet will not come off with a good impression.

Most people are here because they see the potential of Bitcoin as a future currency not centrally controlled by a government. A currency that regulates itself autonomously alongside miners and nodes. I think some feel the ability to launder money or transact sudoanonymously as irrelevant because there are so many other ways to do it that it doesn't matter one way or the other. Others see it as a positive in that they care about their privacy and one alt-coin even focuses on privacy. Privacy in general comes back to the "nothing to hide" argument and I don't feel we need to discuss both sides of that matter here. Just suffice it to say I feel most Bitcoiners care about their privacy. 
Bitcoin, being decentralized and free comes with the cost or benefit of semi-privacy. I like the disruption and the idea but I feel eventually Bitcoin will be accepted as a currency rather than rejected so it will probably integrate with the current systems. I personally hope this leads to an eventual new view on money and how people treat it.

52GiB/day? I didn't realize the network requirements had increased so dramatically since 2012. Back then, when I ran my own node, 52GiB was maybe 30 days worth of background data, with my node being a subset of that. I never opened ports though so I was limited to 8 connections.
Maybe I should start doing it again, as a responsibility for unlimited internet.

I love the idea. I just really hope you can bring it to more reasonable levels. I understand that finding something that will actually pay off is difficult to deliver cost-wise to a customer and was considering purchasing some shares as it would still be fun and unique but $5/GH/s is too far off the mark.
~~I assume the price has gone down.~~ Nevermind, looks like all the initial shares have been sold and the price is of course trading higher. Anyway, the price is extremely high. Had it been more around $2/GH/s, I probably would have bought a few. That's the way business goes though, if there are enough people who think they will make their money back when they won't, then there is no point in lowering the price.
Calculations as of old diff during announcement ~13 Billion:
15% increase per target period (conservative, considering recent history and future hardware announcements)
$5 initial investment
$0 electricity cost
$630 CAD/BTC
0.00041BTC in the next target period ($0.33 CAD)
0.00261BTC in the next 6 months ($2.06 CAD)
0.00294BTC in the next year ($2.33 CAD)
full return date: never. 1 year return is less than half of investment.
recommended cost/GH/s to make a full return in 12 months: $2.33 CAD
If you were to start selling additional shares, the new price with the new diff and same target increase assumptions would have to be $1.98 for a 12 month return and $1.65 for a 6 month return.

Pool distribution: [ \- (not an indication of location or original sources)
Full node distribution:  [ \- (Not an indication of hash rate distribution)
Those are the facts. I am not going to link to any opinion pieces as you can find them yourself with simple research and I don't want to appear biased in one direction since I hold no opinion.
My own unverified (by others) information that you can use to help you get closer to your research goals:
* Most miners are in china, as they are close to the source (fabs)
* There does exist a US company that survived until today. They've sold bulk miners to a Canadian company that trades on the TSX
* I have heard rumours of Russian hash rate.
* If you want to roughly figure out how much physical capacity exists overall, the math is easy. Take the most common miner (Antminer S9). It is safe to assume it will be an average of the less efficient ones and any more efficient ones not yet released to the public. Then take the total network hash rate and physical size dimensions of the miner plus a power supply. From here, you could figure out approx. cubic ft. required for all existing equipment based on the total network hash rate.
* I do not know know of a way to estimate cost for the larger companies close to the source but you could use their resale prices in combination with your own assumptions regarding possible cost. The estimate will be very rough.
* You'll probably have to investigate land/building costs in china, along with power costs in various areas.
Hope that gets you started. I'd love to hear back if you ever write an article or something yourself on the topic. I don't know of anyone who has done a proper estimate.

That depends quite simply on if you think Bitcoin is going somewhere in the long-term or short-long-term.
You clearly aren't a day trader or you wouldn't be asking this question so I am assuming you are looking to see if this asset is something you should invest in, right now. But with Bitcoin there is no "right now." There is only the past and the future. If you think Bitcoin is going somewhere in the future, then its value will far outstrip all previous values. Or, at the very least if you think it will grow or gain attention proportionally increased compared to the last bubble, your answer if obvious. You should be and should have been putting as much money in Bitcoin as you would be willing to lose, considering your financial situation and risk-aversion.
You will get a lot of opinions in this thread but each will either believe Bitcoin is going somewhere in the short-long-term or in the long-term. Sure, they will be valuable to your consideration but what matters most is your own opinion.
As for your title question, I do not think anyone has a hard answer, though there will be supposition in this thread.
Now for some observations I have found that may or may not be related.
* Ethereum crashed a bit then recovered and Bitcoin's price jump seems to coincide with the recovery of Ethereum
* There was a jump, then fall in April before the large jump we now see. Both brought media attention.
* Craig Wright claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, then backed down prior to the jump. This found its way into many news items, including my local print paper.
* There was an article on Ethereum that seemed to garner more mainstream interest based on who published it (I can't remember where I read it). [Here]( is the google trends.

Tried to reply. Then realized it was locked. Then realized how old it was lol. So very valid today without any changes. Probably because a real bubble didn't happen then and it was prep for one. I did want to address one point:


I wanted to expand this by recommending people treat such funds as they would their savings account. You wouldn't spend a big chunk of it on something most of the time. For example, if you had 10K, you shouldn't buy a $2k TV. You also wouldn't regret purchasing smaller things when you still hold 95% of it. Like, if you have 100K savings, don't regret spending 2K on that TV you enjoyed.
I've followed this advice and if ever I start thinking, "I wish I hadn't spent that X amount of Bitcoin back then," I remember that although more valuable now, I enjoyed or made use of what I bought back then and still hold 95% of what I originally had meaning that whether large or small in dollar value, it was still the same **small** percentage value of my Bitcoin/ savings.
So to those who might: Don't think about the new high value of what you spent; instead think about what you did spend/ plan to spend as a percentage of what you didn't spend in Bitcoin. This allowed me to set a nice small budget to actually spend some Bitcoin without having to worry about future regret. It will be different for everyone but I've enjoyed, for example, humble bundle a couple times. I wouldn't recommend someone buy humble bundle though if their current USD value of Bitcoin would mean that purchase would be greater than 1-5% depending on what they consider a large percentage and how often they plan to spend.

What. This article is posted yesterday but the penny was phased out *years* ago. Something is fishy about the huffingtonpost. [Here's a link to a more reliable news source]( Everything else seems fine.
I did some more checking. When she says this, the article they are referencing that the image is of is from [April 12, 2012]( I don't get it. It's not even like April 12, 2016 was a few weeks ago, never mind April 12, **2012**. This journalism is mind boggling.
Anyway, on to the rest. This came as quite a shock to me considering I hadn't heard anything about Mintchip since it was cancelled and the assets were sold off in 2014. Turns out, it was [sold to nanopay]( earlier this year. 
Without knowing how it works technologically, I don't see how it is any different from other payment providers like Google and Apple (besides the fact that it will, theoretically, actually work outside the US). It also seems nanopay is the only one involved and not the Canadian government so really it isn't any different from those in that sense either. Since nanopay has to make money, though, what does that mean for eventual transaction fees?


Looks like it's the same as credit cards. I'll bet they charge the merchants. How else will they be able to give users cash back with every purchase? Just another private corporation providing a payment method and charging the merchants who accept it.


Yep. They are basically just using the name, it seems.

Good thing you didn't buy Bitcoin in 2008 because it didn't exist until Jan. 1st 2009 and wasn't really tradable for a consistent price until 2010. Heck, you could have spent an hour mining it on any old computer back then and very likely gotten 50BTC. No one anywhere online would have suggested buying it at that point.


Satoshi never sold bitcoins.


After first hearing of Bitcoin in 2008 how did you manage to miss all the news articles in the summer of 2011 and throughout 2013/2014 bubbles?


k. So you bought about half the top and hodl because you think it's a bad idea?


This makes zero sense from any point of view. I don't even know what you are trying to communicate here.


Please do. This is something I'd like to hear. I'd love to hear you explain why Bitcoin is a terrible idea because it is based out of an electronic.


Why do you think there will soon be a desperate need for accurate, decentralized information? Care to expand on the use-cases to which you are referring? I believe what you are describing is being worked on but no implementation is practical for a number of reasons. I personally don't think these issues can be resolved.


Care to explain this? Because so far it sounds like you don't know what cryptography is. Or counterfeiting. The simplest and most complete current use for Blockchain is as a currency and this has been proven for almost 10 years, now. Most other uses are better served by a traditional database. The use-case I understand you are thinking of is still best-served by Wikipedia. It's not perfect but there are a lot of unsolved issues trying to do the same thing using a blockchain.
After reading again and thinking more, I think I understand your position. I still don't understand why you think cryptocurrency is a bad idea and I'd love to hear that reasoning. But I also think I understand now that you are a Blockchain enthusiast and see other uses. I disagree that any are nearly as reliable as cryptocurrency but at the same time we need people to think differently and to explore different ways to use new technology. 
That took me a couple reads and I hope I didn't misinterpret anything. Out of curiousity, what is your native language/country?

Which bubble?


Yes, except long-term when something is fundamentally solid. Amazon "blew up" back in 2001. Can we stop these petty illustratives and give me something to actually respond to?


Go on...


Everyone on this sub already knows it passes all money tests. What test did he write about?


In your opinion. If you want to call Bitcoin a commodity like Gold, go ahead. Different definitions of money but perhaps we are on the same page.


Notional floor does not exist because it is a growing technology with a potential price discovery far higher than exists today. We could agree the price is speculative, based on future price potential based on use-case, fundamentals and the total supply cap.


You don't have to be clever to understand these words. Stop skimming with a bias and start reading.
Parabolic: of the shape of a parabola on a graph. In Bitcoin's case, it is horizonal, historically.
Upward: of a direction increasing.
trend: like a pattern that you expect to continue.
Parabolic upward trend: A horizontal parabolic tracking of price that historically happened and is expected to continue. This is based on most adoptions of technology but works with the price of Bitcoin due to the supply cap. The top is unknown but the pattern has been there for 10 years.


I guess you only trade companies and not any commodities?


You conveniently left out the definition of "fundamentals" when you used the commodity example here. Again, stop skimming and read what people say. The fundamentals of Bitcoin are what features make it "perfect" money. Or, if we are going to split hairs about your definition: Perfect medium of exchange. Development has continued in Bitcoin and the "fundamentals" have never gone down.


You need to read about how it is perfect money that cannot be controlled.


Yeah, like anything.

You don't usually hear about it happening because it is typically a targeted attack. Phone companies are not secure. I've swapped companies two or three times to get better deals and each time am surprised at how little information/verification they ask for before going ahead with porting my number over to a new SIM and giving it to me. It's just like any social engineering attack to gain access to an account.
2FA is fine as long as it is used for that - 2FA. In those cases, it is an extra layer - like the fob many corporations use internally. People should be aware that it is just that, though. An extra layer. A layer a hacker targeting you specifically can get past if they work hard enough.
But the larger problem arises when the phone number becomes a method one can use to do things such as reset passwords or change emails tied to account. The problem is the company is treating the phone number the same as the email you signed up with or even treating it as more secure when in reality, it can be compromised even if you are a security wizard. The result is someone being able to access your accounts without necessarily knowing your passwords, email(s) or without having a potential password list for you.
* [LTT describes what happened to them]( in a clear and concise manner
* [The Binance client incident](
* ^(EditForgotAboutTwitter) [CEO of Twitter had this happen]( It wasn't full access but the issue was a "feature" whereby one could use SMS to post tweets. Well, that meant all they had to do was get his phone number ported and they tweeted away.
I personally don't have time to verify how every company utilizes phone numbers for verification and/or if they allow resets so if given the option, I keep it turned off.
Additional, related advice: always have a password enabled on apps like Telegram/Whatsapp/LINE/WeChat to ensure a number port won't allow access from unauthorized users.
I can't speak to the others but telegram allows you to set a password and tie an email account for recovery. It cannot be recovered via SMS. Not to be confused with the numerical "passcode" which is unrelated. Telegram refers to this as "two step verification."

You could be right. On the other hand though, that $30 was a bit of an MTGox fluke and the followup period of relative stability seems to have had the same relative range of price as the current one ($2-8 and $200-700).
It's impossible to say really but my guess is that we will still see that same kind of fluctuation in the suspected upcoming $10k bubble because I think $10k will still be small with all the new attention it will receive. I think it will also soar past 10K more easily than we instinctively think. That said, It's just my guess though, like I would guess on a hockey game and I could very well be wrong. I'm certainly not betting on it... too much. I'm also certainly not stating that it will stay over 10K but one who is invested financially in Bitcoin can dream.

I know you are joking but that's not how that works. Quantum computers could potentially break the public-private keypairs, not the mining hashes. Even if it could do the mining hashes, it wouldn't hash super fast. It would just plain break them by being able to calculate the answer almost instantly because it wouldn't hash like other equipment by guessing. It would just calculate the answer. I think blocktimes would drop to like 1 second and permanently stay there no matter the diff increase.   Someone correct me if I reversed that or misinterpreted something.

*I* think it's a good idea if I were in your situation at this particular time (long-term) but no one can predict the future. Personally, I think if you have to ask, then it isn't a good idea. I spent a lot of time in 2011,2012 learning about Bitcoin. I think understanding what you are investing in is important. And once you are at that point, then you will be able to trust your own judgement more than others.
On the other hand, you may already be confident but simply intimidated by the amount of money. In which case, you have already made an informed decision. Don't ask us. Stay with your well-informed decision. 


This leads me to believe the former in my above. However, rather than answer that question, I feel it more important to urge you to look into how to properly store Bitcoin for the long-term in both a safe manner and a recoverable manner. I think there is something on the side-bar but when considering your setup, consider both theft and loss. I think loss is often overlooked. If your house burns down, make sure you can still recover your keys or seed. And for your own peace of mind, test recovery steps.  


I am rather confident in Bitcoin long-term but I must urge you to sell, even at the loss of a long-term potential gain. Pick a percentage and sell that amount if/when that amount reaches 10k to cover your ass so you can pay your father off as soon as possible while still having a sizeable investment that is now entirely your own. 50℅? Maybe just near $2k. Up to you as it is your peace of mind, though.

A "Paper Wallet" in this case is specifically a single generated keypair stored on paper. Storing a seed on paper is not considered a "paper wallet."
Even if done in a safe way without screwing up, there are issues:
* loss of funds due to not backing up generated change addresses after making transactions
* privacy issues due to address reuse

I was going to agree and rant how the intrinsic value of Bitcoin was literally being perfect money.
But then I discovered upon further research that by strict definition, no asset has "intrinsic value" and anyone claiming such for Gold, Silver, etc. do not understand what "intrinsic value" is.
These people use "intrinsic value" as some kind of word for value derived from non-trading usage. But this isn't what intrinsic value means. It cannot be applied to an asset nor can it be applied in this way.
The intrinsic value of an asset argument is flawed at the very core.


This is also true of any rare asset traded on a large, open market. Especially if it only has perceived value, like Gold. If gold weren't paper traded and pumped and stored for decades, my bet is it would be less expensive.


I was going to disagree but then I realized we agree. I just don't call Gold "money." But the effect is the same.

I have some feedback. The whole thing her is kind of odd everywhere. Both you and the article. No offence but I gotta address each of these.
I have to address this first:


It's not a tool. It's a game. A tool provides something useful. This is not (nor the original source). But it is a fun game to get a fun number.
Starting with the original article/design. Some of these carry over into your design because it is based on it after all.
* I don't get the point of the entire -2 to 2 range. Just turn it into positive vs negative and save some space.
* Where the hell can I buy a new car for $10K these days?
* $100,000 mortgage? For what? Can't buy a house with that.
* $1M for a second house by the shore? This is net worth we are talking about. If your net worth is $1M and you don't have a job that can significantly increase that with some savings, you cannot afford a second house by the shore.
* "name on thing" - the hell is this? This isn't really a useful metric. Also it depends on who you are and what you do but I'm damn sure I can do something to get my name on a College or College building for less than 100 million dollars. Might as well just build my own college from the ground up for that amount.
Anyway, on to your image. I spent too much time ranting on his nonsensical "what you can afford" examples.
* Why does your scale go up so far? 20 is a lot. Heck, I was complaining about the original being 14. Too much to deal with. Combine a bunch of these.
* What's with the arbitrary number choices? I don't see a pattern. Pick something simple like powers of 10 or static percentages of Bitcoin cap.
* Too many columns. Just include net worth at 10K (and remake chart every once in a while). Get rid of worth at 100K, worth at 1M. We can do math ourselves for our curiousities and if you try to satisfy everyone's, the chart ends up too big.
* Get rid of the "can buy" sections. Maybe instead include a footnote of why each number is relevant, instead. I'm sure it was fun to come up with but again, back to the usefulness of everyone's curiousities. We can do our own math. The footnote is relevant, however, because you could put in something more useful in a longer sentence form while not detracting from the focus of the chart. For example: $100K pays off most college debts in full, $2-4M allows most young people to retire modestly if they live off market gains while still growing their untouched amount by at least inflation yearly. Hence wealth "levels" corresponding to living condition levels.
* personally, I see no use of all these wealth numbers. I would condense it down to 0.1,1,10,100,1000,10000 or you can use multiples of 2.1. Mixing the two scales just makes the chart too large. Use powers of 10 or use "fun numbers" but not both.
* max possible others is confusing. Just use what it is derived from - the percentage you own of the total supply.
* I don't understand how you calculated this "Wealth Percentile" number. It makes no sense and I cannot reproduce it.
Anyway, I suspect you won't get any upvotes on this subreddit. It might have been a fun conversation on Bitcointalk back in the day.

The real issue is a social one.
If something were to happen to Bitcoin, it wouldn't trade to zero. So it would have to cease functioning in order to go to zero.
But there are so many people - developers, businessmen, investors - invested in Bitcoin that they would work to fix it or even rebuilt it and relaunch it.
So even if Bitcoin went to zero, it wouldn't stay there. Although its reputation might be severely damaged.

These are some pretty basic questions have been asked ad nausium but are something you need to either have answered or find the answer to because we all had them at one point.
To summarize the answers:
* Difficulty adjusts based on the total hashrate to ensure an average of 1 block per 10 minutes.
* If miners can't afford to keep mining - they stop. Those who can afford it continue. Essentially, we reach an equilibrium, always, due to difficulty adjustments by the network.
* Block reward is (base reward) + (total transaction fees) not just (base reward)

A seed phrase is not a paper wallet. Paper wallet is a specific set of standards that used to be used and included only a single keypair.
If you do absolutely everything right with the old style of paper wallets, maybe. But there are far too many things that can go wrong and there are privacy and funds-loss issues even when you do it right. 
That's why seed phases exist today.
To be clear: A seed phrase on paper is not a "paper wallet" for the purpose of this thread nor in most contexts of discussion.

And I stopped reading. Because that's NOT how quantum computers theoretically break certain types of encryption.
Break means actually break. That doesn't mean crack. It doesn't mean guessing faster. It means solving. Think of it this way: with an unbroken algorithm, you must guess what 1+1= by process of elimination. It cannot be solved. With breaking (ala certain theoretical quantum algorithms) you can solve 1+1=2. No guessing.
While I'm at it, let's go over some more common things.
The only existing theoretical algorithms can only break our private keys, not the mining algorithm.
You must have spent from a bitcoin address in order for it to be breakable via quantum algorithms because the public address is not the public key. You need the public key to use the quantum algorithm and that is only exposed to the network after you make a transaction. This is another (albeit small-risk) reason to avoid address reuse.
Ok I lied. I read more.


Ok. So I must first admit that I don't know what I'm talking about with regards to responding to this but this sounds like a bunch of bullshit to me.
What is he talking about "unencrypted public keys." First off, it's a public key. Why would you encrypt that.
Second, a transaction is broadcast, then it is included in a block. It is then in the block forever, "unencrypted" as he says. Why does he think it's only exposed for 10 minutes? Am I wrong here? Edit: saw a random on twitter mention the same thing. Is false info being circulated or is that information not included in blocks and actually only exposed for (on average) 10 minutes?
And, as I said before, the algorithm SOLVES it. I highly doubt this would take more than a second, nevermind 10 minutes.
I'd appreciate the input of anyone more versed in quantum computing because, honestly, it sounds like the last quarter of that article is misleading. Like, pretty sure the reason current quantum computers can't use the algorithm is because they are limited in what they can computer (ala ASICs) rather than their number of qubits. But like I said, this is out of my area of expertise or time-I-want-to-spend-researching-and-learning right now.

There's a few angles to your question and the answer varies:
General population. Believe it or not, the general population has zero investments and little to no understanding of the economy or even the real effect of inflation - if they are even truly aware of inflation. People in general don't "not spend" because their money is deflationary just like people in general don't "spend more" or take out strategic loans because they are well versed in inflation.
Take an example person who is aware. They are 90% in Bitcoin and don't have a stable income. Let's say most of their income is some odd tech jobs online that actually pay in Bitcoin. They aren't going to "not spend" because they have needs and wants that money buys. If I was in this situation, that other 10% would be in RRSPs, TFSAs and possibly the traditional stock market. I'm not spending from that cushion. I'm spending from what I am 90% in. Risk management. So this person is still going to spend BTC.
I'm no economist and unfortunately didn't get the chance to ever take any classes but inflation, the 10-year cycle and encouraging people to go into debt and try desperately to achieve growth is a thing. There's two angles you are getting at with your question.
1. Bitcoin is an asset as it is now but is accepted and used. So yeah, it would be saved but really how would that affect world economies negatively? It's not like people never trade their gold or silver back into fiat. People need to spend in order to get things.
2. Bitcoin is the dominant currency and replaces world reserve. In this case, economic theory must change. There would be a shift in how we think and design things such that saving is encouraged and being a lender or borrowing would be discouraged.
Edit: I think what is really comes down to with regards to comparison is this: Why do you spend money instead of investing it all in a balanced portfolio in the traditional market? There's your reasons.

Indirectly you are claiming you regret trusting an anonymous person on the internet. But you don't need to.

This has nothing to do with Satoshi and your first paragraph makes me think either you haven't learned much and are exaggerating about those couple years, or you've been here a long time and are trolling.


What does any of that have to do with trust in Bitcoin? It's all about trust with people. If I give you a tazer and go over safety and storage and you now trust the tazer because you understand it, do you then go and give it to a criminal and after he tazes you and steals your money do you claim you don't trust tazers anymore?


See my reply to paragraph 


I feel bad about putting so much trust in electricity in the late 1800s because so few people were benefitting from it at the time.


Oh I see. This isn't about trust or technology. For you, this is entirely about money. Sure, we're all in this for the money to some degree but come on. It's the last part here - "to be rich right now" - that gives away the kind of person you are. You've just gone off-topic. This paragraph has nothing to do with the rest.


Pretty tall order there. Can't do that by itself. If you really believe that, than you think the people involved would help with that. And you should join them. If you are truly that idealistic.

I have read further (including your linked source) and my understanding is that larger numbers being factored require more and more Qubits. It seems to be a matter of can or cannot based on this but also there seems to be a time factor.
Your link only mentioned "brute-force" once and for that one instance he is not referring brute forcing as used to crack a keypair but instead referring to brute forcing the factor. If I am reading what he wrote correctly, he is comparing the speedup to math that is not used in brute forcing attacks but also not practical on any classical computers so we don't even try using it. To be clear, this is unrelated to brute-forcing attacks.
One thing I misunderstood was there is a time factor with Shor's algorithm. Previously, I believed it to be an instant break. But it is still not brute-forcing.
To be more clear, in case this is a source of the confusion, brute-forcing is taking a list of inputs and trying them over and over until we get a public key that matches what we are looking for. This is not referring to brute force factorization (direct search).
Song appears to be referring to brute force attacks in his tweet - not to factoring.
So thanks for the link - I learned some more. I still think this statement doesn't make sense due to what he is comparing:


I don't think he's comparing what he should be comparing but I'd like to hear from you or someone if you know more.
Hmm. I don't really have any specific questions but I think anything I've said above will reveal what I misunderstand. Feel free to correct me.

This post needs to be upvoted.
Because OP here isn't the only one with convictions regarding his incorrect knowledge. I once posted an accurate comment on this subreddit regarding quantum computers and Bitcoin. This was before Google's machine. I sourced materials. Made sure I was accurate. Result? About 10 downvotes and no replies. I double checked. I had gotten nothing wrong.
First off, I had to walk away and come back to reply after reading this because of the sheer willful ignorance of OP. At first it was just ignorance but as he responded to people who explained and sent him proper links, it became clear it was willful ignorance. - not even trolling. Take out your filters, OP, and try to learn something.
Second, the post linked. It's not an article. It's just a quick post.








I can summarize everything in a few points:
* SHA256 used in mining has no known vulnerabilities, quantum or not.
* ECDSA used in the public/private keys *is* theoretically vulnerable due to theoretical known algorithms that could be executed on a real quantum computer.
* The public address is a hashed public key. The result of this is that even if ECDSA was broken, an address would need to have been spent from in order to be broken into. Current common practice is to not reuse addresses.
* No current or near-future quantum computer is capable of running this theoretical algorithm
* Quantum computers are faster at specific tasks. They are not just a "faster processor" overall.


Nowhere in that article do the words "Bitcoin" "miner" "SHA256" "157" or "1,57" occur.
As per my statement on quantum speedup not being some all-encompassing multiplier, you either pulled that number out of your ass or actually did a ton of (useless) calculations based on the article, making incorrect assumptions about how quantum speedup works. Also probably incorrect assumptions about how ASICs work.
Basically, if you were using any numbers in that article, you are wrong. The article says right at the beginning, "for this specific computational task" and the task to which they are referring is NOT hashing SHA256.
It can't do that... ever. Because there is no way to break SHA256 with quantum computers.


ECDSA is used in the address keypairs, NOT the mining algorithm, as I said above. Get those filtered lenses off and read what he fucking linked you.

To clarify as to why:
Addresses that haven't sent funds out do not have their public keys exposed (just the "address" generated from the public key) so in theory, if quantum computers break this encryption, only addresses that have sent funds but still contain funds are at risk.
Another reason address reuse is not good practice.


Do you have a source you can point me to here? I was under the impression that with current theories and known algorithms, SHA256 was completely unaffected. I wouldn't think a quantum computer would be any faster at computing this - I would have thought slower. But I'm not a cryptographer.

Absolutely. If you watch the interview, after stating that he he wishes he'd bought then for today, he goes on to even say multiple things that basically indicate he would have sold at a mere 2x or 3x. And all of it.
People hodl for two reasons
1. They understand the technology, potential impact, risks and potential future of Bitcoin.
2. They saw hodl memes and want to be rich.
The type 2 people will most likely both over-invest and get out too early. Some might make a profit. There's some people who don't do this, mainly due to rarer personality traits and after several years of owning coins may discover their "aha" moment and convert to type 1 people. Many others may convert to type 1 people after having sold and ignored. But a lot of people will only see the price and despite being surprised it is still around, will be fearful of a failure of Bitcoin and either never buy, or buy on excitement now, only to become fearful later.

You: "The IBM zEC12 is 5.5GHz and can mine crypto 1,527x faster than video cards."
Bob: "No it cannot. The limited instructions and many cores of current video cards outperform any conventional processor. The CPU frequency impacts this insignificantly and isn't the only metric in speed." Besides, there's no software to do that.
You: "The processor implements the CISC z/Architecture with a superscalar, out-of-order pipeline and some new instructions mainly related to transactional execution."

So, I am writing my master's thesis on Bitcoin.
*Alternately, avoid the debatable "so," entirely.*
I am writing my master's thesis on Bitcoin.


My thesis is called/titled, "Influence of Bitcoin’s Legislation Risk on its Exchange Rate."


Do you guys have any useful resources I could use? In the application part of my master's, I want to compare bitcoin exchange rates to news that was released. ~~and see how big of an impact it had on the exchange rate~~. ^(\[redundant due to use of the word "compare" making your intent clear\])
*An alternative options:*
\[...\] I want to compare bitcoin's exchange rate to news \[...\]
*The redundant section re-written to make sure if you do need to write something like it, you can fix the grammar.*
\[...\] was released^(\[comma redundant\]) and see how big of an impact ~~it~~ the news had on the exchange rate.
Except for your consistent failure to capitalize "I," most of your mistakes aren't always there and are likely just an occasional oversight rather than an actual lack of English experience/ knowledge. Don't forget capitalization in titles.
Unrelated to grammar, one thing of note is that correlation does not imply causation. So you cannot assume news had an impact on price. If you want  "news impacting price" to be a part of your thesis, you need to assume that this assumption is unassumed and go in trying to prove that there is a causation - not just a correlation.
It's just that the way you've written your request (both "compare bitcoin exchange rate to news" and "impact it had on the exchange rate") makes it sound like you are going in assuming your audience already believes news impacts price.
Edit: Pardon the first draft. This is the second time the fancypants editor in reddit has fucked me over by replacing my bold formatting with asterisks. I'm not re-bolding everything I highlighted before so you'll have to pay close mind to the differences.

It might be the case that you were being simple in your response to have a short response but this is inaccurate and misleading. Just in case you meant what you wrote:
1. A blockchain is more like a database than a ledger specifically.
2. A ledger is the best use of a blockchain that needs to be uncensorable and open.
3. The best use-case for this is Bitcoin.
If blockchain were just a fancy word for digital ledger, then Bitcoin literally wouldn't work. It would be centralized and censorable and die like all the other e-cashes that came before it.

All your questions have likely already been answered well but I thought I'd throw in my own perspective and wording.


Yes. But no. We have issues as people with understanding large numbers. And if you aren't into cryptography, you may also have issues understanding probabilities when brute forcing. To answer this is a shorter manner, however, brute forcing to a degree that even gives you a 0.000000000000001% chance of finding a used private key requires far more computer power than is even possible in theory using current and theoretical computers. Back in the day, I used to keep my coins split into two wallets "just in case" this happened. Then I realized exactly how likely it was and I additionally realized that the chances are so low that the chance of it happening to both keys was basically the same as it happening to one key.


According to traditional economic theory - yes. I am not an economist and unfortunately have not taken any courses on it. But I can tell you that the answer to this question depends on if Bitcoin is a global reserve currency (thereby having all economic theory based around it) or not.
Bitcoin is technically inflationary. It is a controlled inflation that will approach zero eventually. 
Anyway, assuming it is the one currency, then quite honestly it is all theory and everyone can have their opinion. Deflation being bad is based on our current economic system. A Bitcoin system would look different. I'm not going to speculate too much on exactly what it would look like but just say that ever-expanding economies like we have now look like they aren't going to work forever. Look as the negative interest rates now. I propose the possibility that a currency with controlled inflation that cannot be altered in its rate would lead to new economic thinking and result in a better world.
Assuming it isn't, then it will get along just fine like any other asset of limited amount. Does apple stock "go to infinity" because there is a fixed maximum supply? See, that makes no sense. If the value gets to high, they do a stock split without increasing the supply. This is the closest analogy I can think of.
Your last question is a common one. And the answer is they wouldn't - until they want or need something of more value to them. As someone who is majority in Bitcoin, I make responsible financial decisions with everything else. I have an emergency fund etc. My point is, if I need to buy something, I'm going to sell Bitcoin for it (or buy it in Bitcoin) because in the end, money is to save or spend. And when you save it, you are saving it to spend.
Our current financial system still works because most people are financially irresponsible. They go into debt. They don't have savings. But this is just due to human nature, not due to some kind of mass smart awareness of needing to help the economy.
The common argument is that people spend dollars because they know they will be worth less down the line. This is simply untrue. The number of people who think about inflation, even in passing, is small. People don't strategize about spending because they think about economics. People who live paycheque-to-paycheque don't do it because they are thinking about economics. They do it either because they have to (poverty) or because they are financially illiterate (incapable of budgeting/saving). They buy things when they need them and occasionally see a news piece on how packages contain less food and cost more than 10 years ago. They are surprised, then forget about it.
Back to my thinking - I am majority in Bitcoin. I sell Bitcoin when I need to, rather than spend from my emergency fund. Of course people are going to spend Bitcoin if they need to. The majority will need to. Just look at the stories on reddit of people selling all their coin due to medical emergencies or car repair etc.
Also, it will not increase forever - at least not in any huge meaningful way. Maybe a sort of reverse inflation (-3%/year) if we ever actually reach critical mass.


You are missing the whole picture with regards to mining. It is a balance between the following:
* Block reward + fees
* Total amount of hash power on the network
* Value of BTC in fiat currencies
This auto balances.
* If the block reward halves: some miners stop mining. The difficulty drops and the remaining miners make bank.
* The total hash power goes low enough that newcomers can make bank (or close to): new miners come online
* Value of BTC goes up: new miners come online
* Value of BTC goes down: some miners go offline
* This all autobalances to just barely not profitable to most people because of the incentive to mine due to sunk cost in equipment, etc.
In every scenario, the incentives are such that there is balance. We will not reach a point where 50%+ of the network chooses not to mine. This hasn't even happened during 80-90% drops in fiat price.
The incentives are there to combat the little incentive there is to attack the network. They will mine instead.


This either goes back to the theory that deflation is bad (see my answers to  or it goes into a misunderstanding of the Bitcoin supply.
The supply of Bitcoin will total just under 21 million coins, each divisible by 100 million. The worst case scenario is Bitcoin is mass-adopted and must account for all the money supply. Let's use a large-estimate figure (1.2 quadrillion) that puts each BTC at 57M USD. This puts each satoshi at 50 cents, approx.
Loss of coin in the ecosystem could lead to a similar issue but would require massive loss and still require large value increases of Bitcoin. So why is this not a problem?
Simple. I have faith that the code will be altered to accommodate smaller units and/or second-layer solutions will move smaller units. Bitcoin is an extremely active open-source project. I'm not expert as to what solutions are best but I know that they may not be necessary but if they are, the issues will be addressed by experts.


It feels like a circlejerk because fun posts are upvoted a lot, just like every other subreddit. If you read the comments, you'll find some top-voted more down-to-earth comments. Some are jokes. Some people do feel that way. Sometimes it's just fun to be extremely optimistic.
The double negative and odd structure in your second sentence confuses me and I can't figure out what you are trying to say.


86% upvoted with 34 net upvotes tell me that yes, you should ask these questions.


This has been my conclusion. But it is also important to understand what is and isn't actually a problem. However, if you still think some of these things are problems after having fully understood them, then you are well-informed to counter Bitcoin and fully free to disagree with ideology and/or the ecosystem. Ask lots of questions.

At a higher level, you misunderstand what a block is. It is not a delivery method for the next "mined" coins generated.
It is a grouping of the next entries in the Bitcoin ledger. There can be no last block or there would be no more transactions.
The block reward is simply another entry in the ledger. It is the only transaction accepted by the network without an input. Or more simply (if a bit less accurately) the only transaction accepted with just a receiver - no sender.
Miners are rewarded for successfully mining a block by inserting a valid transaction to themselves, following the rules of the network. Right now, the network would accept them sending themselves 12.5BTC + the total transaction fees of all the transactions in the block.
In fact, it is possible for a miner to mine a block and not include such a transaction - effectively not rewarding themselves. Although, there is no incentive to do so, other than curiousity.
They could also try to reward themselves more than this amount if they wanted. However, the block would be rejected by the network - ignored.
So eventually, the network will not accept a miner trying to reward themselves more than 0BTC+ total transaction fees of the transactions in the mined block. Nothing changes other than the number here. Just like every other block reward halving.

Some blockchain explorers will consider an address invalid if it has no transactions. This is because it doesn't exist on the blockchain until a transaction involving the address exists.
As for your funds, if you provide more details, we can help. Consider useful screenshots with personal information blocked out (like status/history screens).

Again, there is nothing incorrect about my advice. I understand perfectly well what you are saying.
I never said you needed to download or sync the chain to access a core wallet. All I did was say it was simpler.
Perhaps you don't know the meaning of the word:  *More easily understood or done; presenting less difficulty* 
Simpler =/= necessary
I am claiming that for a new person, waiting the time to do so, then sending a transaction is simpler than opening the console and dumping keys.

Yes. But you've ignored the issues I mentioned. It is an old standard that is bad. If you want coin on paper only, generate a seed phrase instead.
Even if you are one-time gifting something that is meant to be swept, generate a seed and display the public address you sent the funds to.


I know instructions for this exist. I'm not going to look them up. But it doesn't change the fact that you should be generating a seed phrase today, not a single address.


If these people need coin, they need to be able to spend it. Complicated offline paper systems and having them sign individual transactions does not ease adoption. Everything is a compromise.
As for Chinese phones, you literally cannot trust any device if this is your viewpoint. Like I said before, though, it is a balance.


And suddenly you lost your ability to make cohesive, understandable sentences. If you want to rephrase this, I'll reply to that.
I think you are still missing the main point here that "paper wallets" are defined as a single public and private key generated for paper. Seed phrases are what should be used today, even if you think some people should store funds on paper and sign offline transactions.

There's a mess of comments with good advice but also some oddly upvoted comments that are either misleading or confusing. Not sure why the one guy was suggesting you send coin to coinbase when we are talking about two wallet.dat files on a USB. He's upvoted too. Makes no sense.
OP, your original post contained insufficient information for us to help you. You remedied this in the comments. Below is full useful text.


First, some definitions: QT is the wallet software you used. Electrum is a popular third party option.
OP, your simplest option is to download both the Litecoin and Bitcoin QT wallets (obtain from bitcoin.org and litecoin.org) on a secure computer and let them fully sync. Once complete, close them. Now, via trial and error, replace the wallet.dat file for the Bitcoin wallet with each you have on the USB, one at a time. Make sure when you are replacing the files that the wallet software is closed. You will eventually find the wallet.dat files that contain your coin for each. This is a bit arduous but quite frankly, I am unaware of any program that handles the wallet.dat format other than the QT wallets.
After this is complete, I recommend selecting a modern, consumer-friendly wallet listed on bitcoin.org (Electrum is popular). Preferably for your mobile device. If the amount of coin is more significant than expected, consider other methods of cold storage. Now send the coin to said new wallet after properly backing up your seed phrase.
There is no way of knowing which is which without actually attempting to import them trial-and-error style.


By "be careful asking those questions here" he isn't introducing something new as hinted. He is actually referring to what he later says about strangers PMing you trying to ask you to do things and scamming you out of your money.


This will accomplish nothing. OP, ignore this user. User, re-read OP's problem.


This user is referring to a method of extracting the private keys containing the coin once you have the QT wallets installed and have figured out which is which. This is more complicated. I recommend simply sending the coin to a new, modern wallet.


This is a scam. Do not PM this user. If the user cannot post full instructions publicly, then there is something wrong with the user's intentions.


Electrum does not support wallet.dat files. You need to export private keys from QT or simply send a transaction from QT.


This is an excellent suggestion. Once both are synced, unplug your network cable and continue with attempting to figure out which is which.


There exist airdrops and forks. Both essentially mean that another coin is tied to your address or contained by your address but by a different coin software. Perhaps now is not the time to even think about these but my advice here is simple: do not lose those wallets after moving your coins. These alternate coins may exist on other networks and the key to unlocking access is in those .dat files. So keep them safe for the future.

Roger is so good at propaganda that anyone who debates him needs to be an expert in almost everything Bitcoin, including the code. He will dismiss and move from topic to topic until he finds a lie his opponent can't speak on specifically enough. He will then go back to that to derail his opponent. Even when 1/4 of the audience knows he's bullshitting, it doesn't matter because the rest become swayed by his confidence and the key points (lies and half-truths) that sound reasonable because of his methods of delivery.
All this - requiring that much from his opponent because of his propaganda skills. But because of those skills, he doesn't need to have any knowledge at all. There are people who even think he's a coder (he can't program!).

* Money for savings is not the same as money for investing. Pick one. Savings is money you keep saved and do not invest other than into the stable returns of a savings account. Investing is putting your money into risky assets in order to attempt to either beat inflation (which cannot be done in savings) or make larger gains at a higher risk. That is not savings.
* Coinbase and any company currently in the game is not well-regulated and they are certainly not insured. Many well-reputed companies have disappeared with customer funds. Until regulated, insured companies appear, do not have your funds on exchanges for longer than is needed to make your buy or sell. Not your keys, not your crypto.
I have to tell you that your mindset right now is incorrect for investing in Bitcoin. Until you can get exposure via traditional markets and regulated, insured custody solutions, you must learn about Bitcoin and you must take responsibility for custody of your own coin.

Irrelevant historical comparison. The correct comparison would be when we went from 1100 to 20K. Or 11 to 257. Or 1.10 to 30. Or 0.11 to 1.
You cannot compare the start of a bubble with the top of a bubble. Compare start to start or top to top. Or, as I did above, compare the full bubbles runups to the full bubble runups.
This is why everyone shouting that it will top out at 50K and crash to 20K make no sense. There is no historical precedence for it. Historically speaking, we will go to 100K-300K, then crash to between 20-50K during a bear market.

You need to take some time to sit down and develop your own entry strategy. Planning in advance helps avoid costly emotional decisions.
You need to ask yourself questions like:
* How would I feel if the price just climbed from here and you did nothing now? You bought now? You sold now? How much?
* How would I feel if the price dropped from here and you did nothing now? You bought now? You sold now? How much?
* You need to balance the above two. Only you know how you feel about them and how they affect your risk tolerance to achieve gains.
* What do you expect from the market? Best-case? Worst-case? What are the chances? Most people who will answer you here (including myself) expect the bubble patterns of the past to continue to a 100K bubble and possibly a 1M bubble. You need to assess your own opinion based on research and put in according to risk. The reasoning of the bubbles is why many will say anything under 10K is an amazing price.
* What is your time horizon? When do you want to exit? If fully never, how much and when?
A spreadsheet can help if you are into those. You can experiment with different possibilities and balance how you feel about each.
Once you've figured out a timeline for entry, you can do the same for your exit. Never fully exit Bitcoin - is my opinion. But you can still experiment with prices and when you want to exit with how much. Model it in a spreadsheet.
There's a lot to consider. Maybe this will give you a start.
I like models. I like assessing possible outcomes and nailing down exactly what Bitcoin needs to do for different outcomes for myself.
If you don't like that, just DCA. Pick a date each $timeframe and enter the same amount no matter what to avoid regrets and average your buy-in cost. Same with your exit.
If you want to play around a bit more, you could set a bit for DCA and a different amount for trying to time your buys. Worst case, it might serve as a reminder that timing the market is impossible and no one here can help you do that. Best case, you get lucky with an entry time.
**If you didn't read all that and want short-term advice:** Don't delay buying. But make sure you still have cash to buy with again if it dumps.

There's a show called *Are You Afraid of the Dark* and it is sort of like a *The Outer Limits* or a *The Twilight Zone* for children.
Anyway, I watched an episode recently called *The Tale of the Gruesome Gourmets* where two children of the landlord of a building are concerned that their parents' new tenants are cannibals.
One is convincing the other that they should have a look in the apartment while the tenants are away. The younger boy says, *"It's not breaking in if you have a key."*
My point is you messed up from the beginning: You were not the only one with the key. Even if you trust the site, there are many things that could go wrong on their end that could compromise that key. Storage is one. Another user here mentioned a rumour the site had been sold.




This is where you f\*\*ked up.


If I were a smart crook looking to scam funds, I would want to establish trust and make sure I have a large pool of funds available to steal at once because once I steal funds, word will get out and both new incoming targets as well as the amount of currently available targets will decrease. I'd be quite willing to wait years while having a well-reputed service before taking the funds for myself. So no, not surprising at all.
For anyone else reading this, there is another reason you should not be using paper wallets (paper wallet as defined by a single keypair generated and stored on paper. Although there are other methods of storing Bitcoin on paper, they are not commonly referred to as a "paper wallet") at all these days except under very specific circumstances.
You want to be using modern standards. Bitcoin often requires change addresses and using old standards can lose you money. Generate a seed phrase and store this. Modern wallets do this as per BIP39. The seed will generate as many keypairs as is needed so when it comes time to restore in case of emergency, you will not lose any funds.
As an aside, this also goes for anyone using an old wallet.dat. The old wallets only generated and stored 100 keypairs at a time so if you made too many transactions without backing up, the restoration would lose funds.

Off the top of my head this could be accomplished by:
1. Generate a new address
2. sign a transaction from your wallet to this new address
3. hand someone the "cheque." It would contain the private key to the new address as well as the signed transaction for them to broadcast.
4. If you want to prevent them from using it for an amount of time, use a timelock. I am personally unfamiliar with them but they would accomplish this.
5. They would need to additionally sweep the funds from that address after "cashing" the cheque.
The main problem, obviously, is that both of you would need to be technical since no one does this so no one provides a high-level way to do this. If this is a desired feature, it could become some kind of standard and then be easy to accomplish both ways. I doubt this, however.
The other problem is the same as with the current banking system: before they "cash" the "cheque," you are able to empty your balance from your wallet and close it like if someone emptied their bank account and closed it before you cashed it.
I think you will run into a lot of topics in this discussion saying stuff like how this isn't what Bitcoin is about and how it doesn't make sense and how there is no circumstance in which it makes sense to use it.
I cannot think of a use-case for this but that's not what you asked.
There is no wallet that supports anything like this but it would be possible to implement.
But there are likely better solutions for most circumstances you can think of in which you would want to use this.
So based on that, no - I do not think it would help with adoption in the least.
You might want to use transaction signing and/or timelocks to achieve certain things, however. And I do believe those features can be expanded to allow more creative uses that could help with adoption in the future.

It's good news because it means they see enough possible business from people spending in Bitcoin. Right now it's not about adoption/acceptance of BTC itself but of the users.
This is also the incentive. But - as has happened with Newegg Canada, Dell and I believe Tigerdirect - that incentive is very easy to remove if not enough people use it. And at that point, when the company gets enough complaints or has issues, they would rather remove the option than fix the issues or deal with the complaints.
In the case of Whole Foods, etc. it's worse than you describe. Not even the real payment option you are describing. With them it goes like this: You move your money to a wallet by this one specific company that is essentially an exchange so that when you pay them, YOU will be the one exchanging. They won't even be taking crypto through a third party. They will just be taking your fiat after you've exchanged it.
People don't understand that things will be slow and that we are still early. Every business wants to receive money in their own currency. You can't rationally expect them to directly deal with accepting Bitcoin, then manually convert it at this stage. People touting BTCpayserver as an alternative to bitpay for large businesses aren't thinking rationally. They don't want to deal with this shit at this stage. What they need is a business built around BTCpayserver that will automatically convert to their fiat during the transaction. It's like if some dude from Japan wants to pay you with his credit card. The credit card converts the JPY to USD for you and him so both of you are dealing with what you want.
The idea of businesses who are for profit and not idealism accepting and dealing directly with Bitcoin is a dream reserved for mass adoption of crypto and is not something that can be done immediately just because a bunch of people want it. Everyone has to want it and we are a long way away.
\&gt; So what’s the point? 
After everything I've said, if you don't understand the point then I'm really not sure what else I can say. Most people don't care about idealism. They care about what they can and can't do as an end user or a business. I used to be able to pay newegg with bitcoin until they stopped taking it in Canada. That was great. I used to be able to pay in Bitcoin at some other places until bitpay became incompatible with most wallets. Businesses could have a low-cost solution to accept Bitcoin and receive the currency they need.

That's because traditional fiat money all suffers from both saturation and continued, unending inflation.
Bitcoin as an investment is more comparable to an early technology stock, despite not being a stock itself. The currency is literally tied to the development of the technology meaning a stock doesn't even need to exist.
Pushing your "higher ideals" about what Bitcoin is and isn't despite years of investors that clearly disagree with you doesn't make you correct.
Frankly, your statements above come from a place of ignorance and idealism that I've seen a lot in isolated pockets on here. I doubt anything I've said will mean anything to you.

Don't be demeaning. Everyone has an opinion, with their own reasoning - as long as they don't think they "know for sure."


I personally find that a likely case. I think we will continue to see +0 significant digits moving forward in bubble cycles to 100K and 1M but on separate occasions. 100-1K was relatively short and 1K-10K was relatively long, resulting in a potentially normal average.
A million will be tough without mass adoption (which I don't see soon) but I believe it still likely due to the roundness of the number. It's been an "endgame" target for a lot of fomo speculators for some time. It's one we might just barely tap during a bubble instead of significantly going over - more like the 1K bubble.
In 2011, I thought we'd take 10 years to reach $100. Look at how that turned out.
Moving up from a million (or even approaching a million again after the 1M bubble) seems less likely to me in a purely speculative market.

Article is locked behind a wall.
There is a lot of misinformation in this thread and a lack of full clarification.
So first, let's address this:


This is NOT how quantum computing works. There is no theoretical algorithm for this.
It won't "speed up cracking" it will actually break the encryption. This means using the unique nature of quantum computing, there is already a theoretical algorithm that can, given a public key, decrypt the private key, defeating it.
This is a matter of instantly finding the other key, not taking less time to crack it or even needing to try to crack it. Cracking is guessing one at a time. Breaking or defeating is using an algorithm to reverse it.


This is false. Only certain encryption will be broken. Google, "shor's algorithm." I'm pretty sure, actually, that this is the ONLY algorithm for this task so anything not covered by it is likely safe.
For example, with regards to Bitcoin, the public/private keypair is vulnerable but the hashing algorithm for mining is not.
It is also important to note that until coin is spent from an address, it does not expose enough information to break it. The address is technically not the public key.


There already exist a multitude of "quantum resistant" algorithms that are in common use today. Hence why not "all encryption" would be broken.

I've never played the original Dope Wars so I'm a bit lost with the mechanics of this game.
It took me a bit to realize that in order to advance a "turn" I had to travel to a random location. Is there any rhyme or reason for each location or are they all equal and just a way to advance the turn?
I've played 4 games so far and so far and about 70% of the time I run into an event losing 5-15% of my morale and the plus morale events seem few and far between. so I've never gotten past day 24. Is there some kind of trick to this or is it random, so just keep trying, expecting to lose 90% of the time?
Your last advice is so avoid over-trading in order to increase changes of making it to the end of the month but in my experience so far, I'm not seeing a difference between the number of morale-related events whether I trade or not. edit: I tried not trading at all and still died on day 24.
Basically, I'm asking if this is supposed to be one of those games that relies heavily on luck (ala FTL) or if I'm playing it wrong?

No. That's the point of encryption. Some older encryption methods are already broken but the ones in use today are not.
You might be confusing "break" with "crack." Cracking is a method of guessing over and over very fast until you get the correct output by running the encryption algorithm in the intended direction. Success in this just means the keypair was weak, used an older, weaker algorithm or you sat there waiting for a billion years. You've cracked the password but you have not broken the algorithm because if they generate a new keypair, you will have to crack it again.
"Break" means you found a way to compute the private key from the public key (unintended). This has, as I've said, been done before with algorithms we no longer use. It is not a matter of "time" though. It is a matter of problem-solving. As a human. With a human brain.
Bringing this around to quantum computers, they give us different possibilities with regards to calculation that weren't possible before. Algorithms to break some (note: SOME) current encryption already exist but require theoretical general-purpose quantum computers to run.

First off, a lot of us would. If it was locked to that, it beats out any savings interest rate and even GICs.
In fact, it would be better for a lot of people. Your target audience would be slightly different but wider. In fact, adoption would be faster because there is suddenly a magic way to avoid inflation without taking risk. Bitcoin would become the obvious choice.
But that's not really why I'm responding to you. That specific example fell apart on you but you are trying to get across a point so let me address your point.


So fucking what? Who cares? Bitcoin works as an asset because it works as a perfect currency on the base layer.
Every market is the same. The builders build. The early adopters experiment. The investors invest. Speculators speculate, coming and going with the highs and lows.
I suspect you are trying to get at the point "everyone should be a builder or leave." That's not how people work. Attacking the users and potential users (or potential contributors) doesn't help anyone.

I like your ideas but I think I'd change it slightly.
1. Buy a very small amount of Bitcoin
2. Get it into a mobile wallet listed on [bitcoin.org](
3. Learn the basics of how Bitcoin works
4.  Learn about the serious flaws inherent in central bank fiat "play" money
5. Study what happened prior to, and after the 2008/9 crisis 
6. Buy Bitcoin
7. Hold Bitcoin
8. Wait
9. Be patient
10. Keep learning
11. Go to step 5
I believe in hands-on so having a small amount of Bitcoin while learning is good, in my opinion. If you make $20K/year, what's $50 (reasonable amount to be large enough to avoid static costs making it not worth it)?
The key is to avoid the trap of getting addicted to buying before completing step 3. The results could be disastrous with issues like storing on exchange, losing keys or other poor security.
I'd never invest in something before at least 10 minutes of in-depth research (or longer, for something more complex like Bitcoin. Maybe an hour if you understand cryptography at an academic level even a little or a couple days if you have zero knowledge of IT-related things). This is of course with my level of google skills. Some people may need a couple hours minimum. Research time could also depend on your background and other current understandings.

There isn't. This is why "sweeping keys" is so common. You never ever ever keep money in a wallet or keypair you were given because it is indeed impossible to know who has the private key.
Back in the day "paper wallets" were a thing. They contained one private key and optionally the printed public key. You always needed to sweep them if you didn't generate them yourself. Some people would give away paper wallet with instructions and if no one claimed them, they would just take the funds back after a year or so because they kept the private key.

No one can tell you the future but given a disclaimer that past performance does not indicate future performance, I can tell you what I've seen. This is off the top of my head so some timeframes might be a bit off.
I got I to Bitcoin after the second great bubble. The first was in 2010 to 1USD. After that it crashed to about 30 cents and didn't recover fully until 2011. During that summer, it bubbled to about 20 USD and crashed to 2 USD.
I started hobby mining in late 2011. Never directly invested. It was a long haul of slow but steady gains until it started taking off after 13 USD. It was 2013 when it hit the 100 USD bubble. I think it peaked at 257 USD or something. Crashing back down to the 40s.
It was later that year when it hit the 1000 USD bubble. Crashing down to 200 after a false climb from the initial crash to 600. It took longer to recover this time. A slow gain, just like after the 10 USD bubble, but longer until the start of 2017 when it really started to pick up.
So without giving opinion on what might actually happen, I can tell you that previous bubbles have been 10x the bubble before and besides exchange errors, Bitcoin has not gone below its previous bubble during the crash after each newer bubble.
It's also interesting how slow this climb is compared to previous bubbles. Previous ones were faster to gain but we have yet to reach 1000 USD this time.
So in my opinion, I believe there is room for Bitcoin to grow. Adoption is still extremely slow and infrastructure is still new and unfinished.


The answer to if you should buy depends on your own opinion of how far you think we are into the current bubble. 


I think you must have made a significant return because there was a recent altcoin bubble. Ethereum alone is up a major amount while even litecoin has hit new highs. 


Which will you regret more? Investing, say, 10k in Bitcoin and having that investment be reduced to 1000 worth or not investing and having your lost 10,000 investment be worth 100,000?


You really, *really*, **really** need to make your own informed opinion on this. You need to research the investment and form your own opinion.
That said, in the short-term, the first time most things hit a nice big round number with resistance, there is a dip because people are selling like mad at the resistance price. And smart people are selling just above and below. Then people panic if it doesn't go above and/or stay above. We have already had one such dip just recently from 7997 down to ~7500.
If you want to buy a dip, you must put in orders in advance so you can catch them. This means you'll have to determine how low you think it will go. The same is true if you want to catch a high point.
No matter what you do, you cannot accurately predict at what price it will dip or by how much. That is why trading is gambling. You can increase the odds to your favour but you can't always win.
Basically what you are asking is if you should buy now or wait and see if it goes down. I would do both. Cover both your bases and end up buying less if it goes up or end up buying more at an average of the two prices if it goes down. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:31:15

The people who say this are twofold:
* People who have been brainwashed into thinking this from constant exposure to negative comments that Bitcoin won't scale and that all current and future solutions are pointless.
* The people perpetuating those negative comments in the first place.
Sometimes these people are the same.
"Store of Value" was first brought to my attention as a way for some people to fall for the idea that Bitcoin can't scale, while still trying to support Bitcoin.
It's the Trump effect. People like Ver are very good at repeating things over and over again, despite the doublethink and falsities. People who hear or see those things again and again tend to accept them, despite everything.
These people do one of two things: They either move to supporting altcoins for faster transactions or they concede that Bitcoin will never be better but keep their support with the phrase, "It's a store of value." Sometimes, they do both.

So in other words, screw small business - post back when you are big enough to have your own IT department?
Yes, you can follow steps to set up BTCpayserver or something but no rational small business is going to attempt something like that unless their owner just happens to be at the tech level where they have some Linux experience or something and has the spare time.
Businesses pay stupid prices for things many individuals can do themselves and there's a reason for that. Time is money. So is liability when something is unknown.
People keep toting btcpayserver as some end-all solution. It's not. It's a great solution and, quite frankly, would work wonderfully for an intermediary company that would provide a service hosting it and setting up exchange interaction to what businesses need.

I used to deal with people who had issues on a topic they knew little to nothing about a lot. One of the biggest problems that would come up is said people would do what you are doing: Make a ton of assumptions and ask a question that instead of addressing their problem, addresses one and only one of the many possible causes, without providing details on their actual issue. I can only guess that maybe it's a psychological issue many people have, possibly caused by their embarrassment about a lack of knowledge on a topic. So instead of asking for help broadly, they gamble on the 20% chance they are right.
It's like you have a strange noise coming from somewhere in the front of your car but when you go to the mechanic you say, "I think my breakpads need changing." then walk away leaving them to possibly not even notice the noise because you told them what you thought the solution was, not what your problem was. A better approach would be to say, "my car is making a strange noise here at the front when the engine is idle."
This is what you are doing here. In future, I recommend you do not do this. It doesn't help people help you. Further commenters had to pull info out of you like pulling teeth and we still don't have the full picture.
You posted 8 hours ago and I'm not coming back to this thread so I have to make some guesses and assumptions. If I'm wrong, I'm wrong but you should have posted all details in the first place. I'm not going to pull teeth but I will work with what others have pulled from you.


* If you are mining monero or using a multi-miner that might switch over to monero, they recently switched to a new algorithm that pretty much is only as fast as the amount of cache you have. It might not fully utilize your processing power as it wouldn't speed up the algorithm
* some other CPU algorithms are like this to a lesser extent
* you didn't mention GPU, so this seems likely. If your mining speeds match those of others with the same hardware, even more so.




* run malwarebytes antimalware free edition
* if this finds nothing, either there is nothing or it is not in their database or doesn't match a malicious behaviour. You are unlikely to find anything but you could try ADWcleaner, JRT and kaspersky (free scanner)
* if you think there is something, backup, format and reinstall windows.


* Low... usage? A process can't stop another process from utilizing resources unless it is consuming those resources itself. Even if a process doesn't show up in task manager, CPU utilization will include it.
* Go to "details" and sort by "CPU." "system idle process" doesn't count

Cars weren't a lot faster than horses and in the beginning, speed was severely limited by laws. They were louder and horses were much more well supported by infrastructure. There was even a law requiring a man to walk in front of the car to warn people in [some places](
So your question is moot by the addendum of "the average person would give a shit about"
Without the addendum, the technology is gamechanging in a lot of ways. The underlying tech has started to be used in other areas. Go read up on it.
Just like the car back then, Bitcoin has virtually no infrastructure. The tech is superior but there is no "average person" shits given because of this. No "average person" will give a shit about it until quite a number of years from now.

Bitcoin as a currency operates differently than 20th century central banking. People have gotten used to advantages such as that you mentioned and therefore expect them. For Bitcoin to be successful as a replacement you would need a breakout in markets that don't already have those advantages and therefore Bitcoin is better in every way. Then services would need to change and be built around Bitcoin for those who expect to not be responsible for their own money.
The concept of not being responsible for your own money is actually relatively new. This new banking system has also resulted in an expectation that most people will borrow money in order to make large purchases. Prior to this new banking system, it was considered wise to neither borrow nor lend money. 
I think you are also seeing "Bitcoin" as an ecosystem. It isn't. It's not a bank. It's a currency. USD doesn't provide consumer protection; laws and services do (for example, a third party intermediary service. Side-note, you referred to the 2nd party as the third party. You pay the 2nd party. Your are the first party. The third party is an intermediary.). 
And finally, of course, Bitcoin replacing the current system is an idealistic pipe dream, at least for the next hundred years at the very least. It certainly is invested in enough and usable enough, though, for more and more pressure to be put on its acceptance for purchases and in turn, 3rd party services to enhance or add functions. But in the foreseeable future, I can't see it being more than a common addition.

If you try to time a market by waiting and are the kind of person who has to ask, then there is a high chance you will be fucked more if you wait.
Always wait.
Until you've researched something well in order to be confident putting your money there.
Bitcoin is historically not the kind of market you get into to make 10 or 20% over 3 years. In 2012, if you held until today, would it have mattered if you bought at $2 or at $8?
"Worth" is also something only YOU can answer for YOURSELF.
You've provided too few details for any of us to really try and answer this for you. And, in my experience, most people who provide too few details will never provide the whole picture. It's like pulling teeth. They'll ask "like what." Then you'll give them 3 things to give them an idea of what to say, indicating that there's a lot more than the 3 things and they need to provide a bigger picture. But in response they'll directly address one of the 3 things you mentioned and ignore the other two. And they'll expect you to somehow fill in the blanks or act as if you didn't ask the others.

Is that worth the chance of losing that $10? $100? $1000? I'd think the $10 would be a no-brainer. The larger amounts might require more confidence or knowledge of Bitcoin itself.
Practically speaking, in my opinion, I believe we are likely to have 2 more market cycles, reaching $100K, then $1M. Beyond that depends much more on real adoption and usage than market cycles, investors or hype.
Let it be knowledge that guides your investment into Bitcoin, however. Not your desire to gamble. That would get you in trouble.
Let's also assume I am wrong and you aren't asking about it being worth it financially. Let's take the small path that maybe 5% of people get into Bitcoin for. Is $10 a worthwhile amount of Bitcoin to gain knowledge by direct exposure and use? Yes. It absolutely is. You can make quite a few transactions with that amount. Open a lightning channel. Close a lightning channel. Maybe buy something online like an inexpensive pin. It would definitely be worth it if you seek knowledge through practical experience.
This is a ramble but these are my opinions and impressions.

\&gt; Bitcoin was created to be digital cash, not digital stock. Those who improperly use it as a stock investment hold it back. 
This is your mistake. You can't force people to use something for a specific reason because of idealism. No matter how much you cry, it won't stop people from using it as an investment.
\&gt; Makes you wonder just how much you are aware that the tech is not the driving force of the fiat evaluations. 
You misunderstand me. I never said low-level technological developments in code directly correlate to price.
You are also suddenly claiming that all "adoption" is the direct cause of price increases.
Price increases are caused by speculation, for the most part. Long-term price increase, meanwhile, is caused by attention to Bitcoin's usefulness and, over the years, it not going anywhere.
\&gt; The tech was cool, but the idea of a DIGITAL CASH that couldn't be manipulated by inflation as fiat currency could was the driving force - not because it would be a great investment. 
You are contradicting yourself. The idea of a digital cash that couldn't be manipulated by inflation as fiat currency IS why it would be a great investment.
\&gt; It wasn't until the nightmare that was MTG that people started treating it like an investment. 
Again, you are trying to force the world to work in ways that it doesn't work. Bitcoin, the currency, has been an option as an investment since it was first traded.
It's difficult to break through to you because there is no metaphor. Bitcoin is actually money. The first time where an asset is literally also the technology behind it and that gives it value.
\&gt; Frankly it is your ignorance and a lack of understanding as to why the first block contained the message "*Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks*" that will cause it to not reach is potential for many years to come. That idealism that you think are isolated pockets come from the very people who made bitcoin possible. Without that idealism, it would not exist. 
And this sums up your complete misunderstanding of both me an what I was trying to explain to you. There are so many things you have conflated and put words in my mouth that I am not sure where to begin. You have accused me of not understanding Bitcoin when you are the new account and made many assumptions about what a new person might say.
You also misunderstand my use of the word "idealism." Idealism in this case does not describe the root of Bitcoin or what it stands for. It describes you believing your ideals are above how markets and economics work. That somehow, because Bitcoin stands for something, it shouldn't be traded for as an investment. That is naive.
\&gt; Oh it means something to me, all discussion on bitcoin does. 
Again, you misunderstood my meaning of "mean nothing to you."
By this I mean exactly what your comment has proven. That you will never understand my point. It means nothing to you. Not, you understand it but disagree with it. But actually that you don't understand it so you make a paragraph arguing things that we're not even discussing or that we agree on, trying to pin me as someone who disagrees.
Even worse, you've conflated and misunderstood so much of what I've said that I doubt even this response will make things clear to you. 
All that ended up happening is somehow you now think a lot of things about both me and what I believe that are incorrect. I doubt anything I say will be able to clear that up as I believe you are now in a place where you have mentally made me into the person you've described in your post so if I keep trying to clarify things and get back to the actual points we disagree on, you will likely pin me as disagreeing with other things and discuss those instead.
Oh well.

My thoughts:
Not really saying anything new, OP. But it is a mistake to compare now to 2017. This is just like when we first went over $1K after the crash, not like when we first went to 10K. The cycles have been the same for each bubble for years. $0.10, $1.00, $10, $100, $1000, $10000.
That inflation stuff you mention - can confirm. I've heard estimates as high as 12%. The trick is what is included in the inflation metrics. For example, housing prices are not. Pretty sure gas is also excluded.
You know what's going on but the one thing you aren't getting is that it's NOT going to be different. Price will run beyond what people think. We will get a $100K bubble (between 100K-300K) and crash after everyone FOMOs in at the top thinking we are headed straight to a million.
This isn't going to be like $10K --&gt;$20K because that's the wrong timeframe. This is going to be like $1K --&gt; 10K. Just look at the history.
I don't understand everyone who keeps saying "it will be different" then proceeds to describe what happened during the previous cycle :S
I also think you severely overestimate current traction of Bitcoin as an investment with traditional people. I don't think you overestimate that growth, however.
@_date: 2017-11-19 03:51:15
I think his point isn't the amount but the fact that anyone could buy in at that price last year. His rudeness indicates an annoyance at "should have, could have" posts possibly because in many areas people post regret at not buying now that they know the price is higher while at the same time poo-pooing the idea of buying at the current price. The price rises every bubble and the same posts come up over and over at the $10 bubble, the $100 bubble, the $1000 bubble.
He does have a point but it doesn't mean he's not still being an asshole.

Alright so this is the first time I've heard that such a change would not require a hard fork. I don't program Bitcoin, though.


Addresses are created from public keys. The changes to the addresses is absolutely nothing like the changes required to be using a different algorithm. With addresses they just have to recognize the new format but with the algorithm change, I'm pretty sure we would need a hard fork.
Like I said, not a bitcoin programmer so there might be a way to soft fork it. But there is definitely a difference here.

If Bitcoin interests you, keep doing research. This question indicates you have done no research because the answer is an opinion brought on by research and understanding.

Consider this: Most people don't spend 24-7 paying attention to the technical details of Bitcoin. When you engulf yourself in the details of something and spend so much time communicating with others who are also engulfed in the thing, you forget that many things aren't "common knowledge" to most people.
If you were in Bitcoin back in 2012 and stopped until now, all this negative talk towards zeroconf would be confusing. Back then everyone loved zeroconf.
Even in 2015, you might not have heard the debates.
And suddenly in 2017, everyone is calling everyone else an idiot for using zeroconf. Like, aggressively like they should already know it without taking the time to explain.
So since you are refusing to explain, I will. I assume you have more knowledge than me so you can use it as a base and correct my inaccuracies.
* Zero conf was once a decent solution for POS given the tradeoff of trusting the sender wouldn't try to doublespend in a short period of time and get their second transaction to propagate to whichever miner mines the next block before the first transaction (unlikely). Essentially, one can doublespend if taking the time to plan a targeted doublespend but not with 100% reliability.
* We don't know what miners could choose to default to. I believe the default used to be to accept the first received transaction but it makes sense that there is a financial incentive to accept the one with the highest fees. This is a freedom they have and a detriment to accepting zero conf.
* Improving the viability of accepting zero conf has not been a priority and consensus seems to have been not to pay attention to it. Therefore, it is not a good idea to rely on it today because code could change (and maybe already has) to make it even less viable to accept.
* One of the things I'm aware of that has changed is RBF but I do not know the full details of how it works. I believe zero conf used to be ok for non-RBF transactions because there is some way to signal if using RBF or not? Anyway, this was added to the detriment of zero conf and the benefit of allowing people to fix stuck transactions. This does not, however, affect the viability of non-RBF zero conf.
* Lightning makes this model obsolete anyway because you have a halfway point between zero-conf and confirmed transaction, encouraging further developments to be to the detriment of zero conf. So recommending zero conf is irresponsible. Lightning needs better end-user support at the moment, however.
Mr. butthole, I do agree with the cop out statement of mr. 42. If you have more accurate knowledge than me, please share it.
The biggest problem is no one has sufficiently brought forward (that I have seen) the current risk of non-RBF transactions vs the old (2012) zeroconf transactions. They are irresponsible to recommend due to lightning but I so far do not see them as less viable than they were in 2012 as long as they are non-RBF. Anyone have some clarification?

I'm not sure I understand what is going on here. As a Canadian, I've never heard of Backpage but it seems like Kijiji.
Why would Backpage losing their Visa account cause a rush of new people interested in Bitcoin?
I've partially answered my question. It seems Backpage takes Bitcoin (never heard that in the news) and if their Visa account was suspended it would be the only way to pay besides Cash/ Check/ Money Order via mail.
Where is this news coming from, though? I created an account and logged in but their credit card form still seems operational (I'm not going to go so far as to put in my valid credit card for a payment).

I'm hesitant in that your post history seems to indicate you are just trying to drum up some attention and not real discussion.
Additionally, your lack of context and very general question indicates a troll rather than trying for actual discussion.
To quote you:


By not being upfront about this, you've misled a number of commenters here into thinking you are a legitimately mislead newbie rather than an informed user trying to get a discussion going. You are biased. Therefore, you are not asking for general feedback on the chart because you already know what to expect.
With that out of the way, I will give you my personal feedback on the chart and perhaps this can turn into an actual discussion.
For the sake of not getting into semantics regarding differences in usage, let me establish right now that the chart is referring to Bitcoin Cash (BCH) vs Bitcoin (BTC).
Let me also establish the [source]( such that is may be referred to to clarify any misunderstandings about the points on the chart.
1,2,3. These points are actually a method of separating one point. Additionally, point 1 cannot exist alongside point 2 and 3 for individual transactions. The one point is as follows:
*You can't reliably get your transaction into the next block and if you can, it is because you paid a higher, more expensive fee.*
BCH is not popular enough to test its scaling method. The lack of delayed transactions is due to popularity and usage, not technology. BTC also has scaling technology but it took longer to move forward because the devs do not work faster because of a popularity boom. 
BTC transaction fees have come down and getting into the next block has become easier. Currently, fees are under what BCH was at during the bubble.
4. Both work with 0-confirmation transactions. The x is misleading. If I can see the transaction, I can say to my trusted friend, hey there, I see the transaction. No need to wait for a confirmation.
I digress from the misleading point. The real argument goes like this:
*BCH has removed replace-by-fee which was introduced in 2013. This allows more confidence in 0-confirmation transaction*
It does. But don't let this give you a false sense of security. 0-confirmation transactions are still insecure. But now you are giving up the user benefits of replace-by-fee. Additionally, it seems the consensus was that having replace-by-fee would help prevent mining pools from providing double-spend services. Who's to say what would have happened but the real point here is that 0-confirmation transactions are not safe enough on either network to be endorsed.
5. This has been discussed to death and is obvious to anyone at this point that the Bitcoin ABC dev team isn't decentralized. Oops, I mean it's obvious the Bitcoin Core team isn't decentralized. Wait...
Point here is that no one can prove that either team isn't decentralized. Despite so much talking.
6. I'm stumped here. No really. I have no idea to what they are referring. I tried googling "permissionless network and development" and all I got that was relevant were two interpretations by some randoms. So here we go again. The argument goes:
*pay-to-play network*
So this just falls back to points 1/2/3
*in the reference client to Bitcoin, only a few people have the power to approve changes*
Pretty sure that's the only way Open-Source can function. Otherwise it would be chaos. No other project is any different, including ABC.
11. This one I had to think about for a moment until I realized it was a poorly-worded reference to the overarching narrative that Bitcoin cannot serve as digital currency due to the above point as is only suited to "digital gold" or "store-of-value"
This point, therefore, needs no response because it relies on points 1/2/3/4/5/6 which I have already discussed.

This will be a short response because I've written too many responses to posts like this. Check my history if interested in more information.


Profits or income? Because you will definitely not make profit in the first few months. You can start your debate at 6 months but at that point, you are looking at just turning a profit *if* your electricity is free and the difficulty does not increase at all (which isn't going to happen).


Before answering your questions: I have mined back with the first 28nm ASICs and a bit before as well as with video cards. I have zero personal experience with solar panels but I look into them every few years. I can tell you that your budget of allocating &lt;1500USD to solar panels and power storage is not near enough. Solar powering a normal home with limited usage is ok because you can bank it. You aren't using it 24-7 but here you are trying to design a system to handle a continual draw of almost 3KW. That's like cooking a chicken on maximum heat 24-7. You will quickly run out of money when designing this solar system. If you successfully design one for &lt;1500USD or even &lt;5000USD, I would be super interested because that would change my mind about converting my home to solar.


Barring solar, yes. This will give you the option of the most cost-effective and efficient miners. In my personal calculations, they will never make profit.


No. You will already be at a scale that is either profitable or not (I think not). Any more money into it will not reduce your $/GHs cost ratio.


I haven't personally bought these but Bitmain has been the go-to for 2 years, at least. Starting with their S5. Avalon is another to look into as generally people seem to have less issues with them (reliability, customer support) but they are not as efficient.


bitcoinwisdom.com. Their pricing graphs. Calculators. Difficulty history and patterns. They are basically your one-stop for raw data to draw your own conclusions about difficulty, profitability and the future.
If I thought I could profit off mining, I would already be doing it. I have the willing partners. I have the money. I don't see a profit.
That said, mining is fun. If you want to spend 4K on a fun project and probably make $2K back, go right ahead.

Nothing will be different. It will go up in price, as it is starting to now. People will flock to it, eventually, resulting in a bubble. Like every other time, it will reach a new significant digit. It will then crash significantly because too many people were hyped about it near the top (saturation). It will not go below the previous bubble's high while crashing but many people will lose money and the majority of new investors will leave. Many who don't understand that people are irrational and therefore Bitcoin cannot go up at a steady pace without bubbles will declare it dead or draw new attention to its well-known drawbacks.
People seem to think that crashes are caused by something not being ready or by things happening too early. The problem is they don't understand that unless a market has been around for decades upon decades, unchanging and predictable, there will be cycles.
To further illustrate my point, I made a chart in MSPaint. 
As an example of the above chart, you might have noticed in the last cycle there were many people complaining about the need to scale. There was such shouting about Lightning being worthless because it wasn't ready then. This was elevated expectations by the public brought on by an increase in attention. When their expectations weren't met immediately, people jumped ship or left. The general expectations drop but the progress of development has also reached a further point now. We're good now. But when attention and price go up again, expectations will start to rise. This will contribute to a crash.


$3K? Why would it go to $3K next time if it is going to be "just another cycle?"
"Just another cycle" will result in a high above $100,000 but below $300,000-400,000, followed by a crash no lower than the previous high ($10,000). Like every other cycle [see the bubbles of Feb-2011 (1USD+), Jul-2011 (10USD+), Jun-2013 (100USD+), Jan-2014 (1,000USD+) and Dec-2017(10,000USD+)].
The day that "this time is different" happens in Bitcoin regarding price is the day we don't reach a new significant figure high during a bubble before crashing. Not saying that that's not going to happen (ie plan for the risk) but it would not be the historical norm. Point being, the idea you expressed as "just another cycle" would actually be "different this time" and your idea of "different this time" would be "just another bubble" although I suspect you aren't thinking about the inevitable crash if that is the case.

Ok, show me the broadcasted transaction. Which is something you **can** do without waiting for a confirmation. As I said in another post, that takes a mere few seconds.


It's a tip, not a payment. It's optional. Why would someone change their mind after the fact? And why would someone who is spending larger transaction fees to double-spend tips, tip in the first place if they didn't have that option?

I'd love to talk about this, especially since it was one of the earliest arguments but I'd like to ask you to clarify and expand first so that we are on the same page. What exactly do you mean by "backed?"


I think part of this is a confusion based on definition. "Electronic" means "having or operating with components such as microchips and transistors that control and direct electric currents."
This is specific to hardware and irrelevant because of redundancy. 


Security is a separate topic. Not sure why are you bringing this into hardware failures discussion.


Ok now you've moved the topic onto security. Sure. But this is a broad topic and you can't make sweeping statements without being specific. For example, the public-private keypairs can be generated completely offline. You can even sign transactions offline to avoid broadcasting certain data.


This suggests you have a fundamental misunderstanding of how Bitcoin works (or maybe there is a language barrier. Is English your native language?). Fundamentally, a bitcoin does not exist. Just the record of transactions. This absolutely can exist offline. The system, however, cannot operate offline.
The difference is important to realize because a number of things are possible because of how this affects things. For example, the offline keypairs and transaction signing I mentioned above. I can create a keypair, send coin to the public address, then sign a transaction offline and broadcast it later to send coin to another address.


Yes but secure *in what way*?


I have generated a seed offline and memorized it and placed a copy in my safe. It has never touched the internet. I sent a bitcoin to the address. It now exists only in my safe. Is your bank information still safer?


Congratulations. You've just learned the definition of the word "speculation." I absolutely agree with this. It's called a market.


It's difficult for some people to understand that something can be not very useful in its current state with the current state of the market and users but have future potential. If you can't look at the history of other Internet technologies and draw a comparison, then there really isn't much to say. Differing opinion.


I've seen this before. The system is literally perfect money from a technological standpoint but due to lack of use, current social norms and especially a full acceptance of everything the current system of their 1st world country has with regards to banking, they don't see any value. Currency. A record of transactions is *the* perfect and only proven use-case.
I've seen attempts to shoehorn other uses into "blockchain technology" and some have been successful, the majority haven't and most are better suited to a centralized database.
Yes, even the educational project you speak of. I can't remember the name of it but there is one. Currently it isn't proven and there are many technological issues to solve. If they solve them, that's promising. But it's difficult to deal with something that complex with something so simple and absolute as a blockchain. You either end up with something you didn't want or you make so many compromises that you end up turning your blockchain into a centralized database to meet your needs.
Counter to that, Ethereum was very successful with their design. They have something and people are discovering uses for it. So far though, its most proven use is, again, as a perfect currency.


Indeed. The most important lesson people need to learn is to verify with multiple sources. It's not like before when errors in books were so few that any library source was acceptable.


Blockchain can't verify information. That would still be left to people. The problem would end up being unable to undo verified information years later when it is proven false. I can't see how this would work. Information is a very human and very changing thing. The opposite of blockchain.
I found it. That project I mentioned. Everipedia. That's the project you are interested in. Or would have been. Since their announcement of "putting information on the blockchain," all they've done is make a token on EOS and use that to incentivize contributions. ie. the only blockchain use is as a currency. They still intend to put the information on the blockchain but nothing so far. Check it out if that interests you.


This is an interesting statement considering the tens of projects that attempt to do literally what you are describing from decentralized storage, to data, to programming. Are you actually entirely unaware of all of them?
But there is a reason they all are working as money (or shares/tokens). It's because it works. That use-case has been working since 2009.
Also, I don't know anyone who sees it as "piles of money" since it can't work like that. The whole money aspect is the ability to transact.


Then why is every project that's trying to do something else also working as money? Or are you defining money differently? What does Bitcoin not do that you think money should be doing?


Really not sure what to say to this. Have you not been paying attention?


Ah. We have ourselves an article-title reader. One who reads titles, not articles.
The issues were twofold and were certainly not something that would allow a person to "double their btc wallet." I see you skimmed the title, picking up keywords only.
* The double spend would cause nodes to crash
* The only circumstance in which someone would be able to double spend is by having enough hash power to mine the block themselves (or luck).
That's my understanding, anyway. The fact remains that it was never exploited.
Also, in case you have any misgivings about "good samaritans," I suggest you look into what open-source means.


It's an entirely open source project. With an entirely open ledger. Anyone can "know for sure" if the system is "already shot itself full of fake coins."


Hmm. Maybe you really do mean "electronic" rather than "software." In which case, please understand that people have spent decades building systems that rely on redundancy, expecting those failures. Bitcoin is the epitome of this. You seem to be assuming if one person's computer fails on the network then that is it for Bitcoin. That is false. For the failure to happen, every single computer in the world would have to fail at the same time. That is redundancy.
As an aside, you do realize the legacy banking system also runs on "an electronic," right?


I agree. Perhaps you should have a look into our current system. You do realize we aren't on a gold standard anymore, right? You do realize 97% of all fiat money is digital, right? Cash only makes up about 3%
You've got a lot of misunderstandings and I really hope you take the time to look into them, rather than sticking your head in the sand. It's really a good thing to be skeptical but if it's something you find interesting, you should be looking to expand your knowledge of the subject, too. I hope you keep an open mind moving forward.

So in other words, you are passing on the cost of spending 1 input/ 1 output from the addresses generated for us to pay to?
Which brings up the following questions:
* I'm not a programmer but batching is common and I'm pretty sure you can do multiple input/ multiple output. So why aren't you doing this?
* If that's not possible, then why aren't you sending payments within a time period to one address as a way to save on costs?
* The most important thing here, though, is this cost is *yours* and something you need to deal with on your side. If you pass it on to the customer, then you have no incentive to solve the issue until enough customers stop using you
* which brings me to my final question, which I don't know if you can answer and is a bit conspiracy-theory-ist: Are you being paid by Bitmain? They made 3 Billion last year so paying off a small payment processor doesn't seem like much of an additional cost.

1. It is. It adjusts every 2016 blocks or about 2 weeks. It's not an on-demand thing. It takes into account all blocks in calculating the new difficulty. 


2. Remember back in elementary school when you picked coloured objects out of a bag so you would understand how probability works?
The average number of goals scored in a hockey game is 2-3 but closer to 3. We can infer that on average there is a goal every 20 minutes of game time. Now go watch hockey. Did you see any goals 10 seconds apart like the gold medal game just now? How about a couple periods without any goals? Probabilities. Averages. 
You posted this an hour before my comment. Since then, block times have been anywhere from under a minute to 13 minutes. 


I don't intend this as an insult, however. But by thinking this, you might be retarding your own learning. When people think they know a lot, they tend to stop trying to learn more.
Your question indicates a lack of fundamental knowledge. Again, not insulting. It's just, if it was taught as a college course this would be week 1. But this is definitely a question you might ask during week 1.
So if you don't want to learn more: ok. Question answered. But if you want to learn more, ditch the idea that you are Bitcoin savvy.

2 minutes to *set him up with the ecosystem*. You forgot because you've been set up with a bank account and credit card for years. That setup definitely takes longer to get into.
Probably 2 seconds to send bitcoin and 2-5 seconds to wait for it to show up as a transaction.
Sure, cash is a few seconds faster but a credit card would take the same - 2 seconds to put the chip in and press ok, 2 seconds to type your pin, then maybe 3 or 4 seconds waiting for the receipt to print.
Clearly time is not an issue in that low range, otherwise cards would never have caught on.

This is only true in current economies based on fiat currency, central banks and whereby the currency is mostly created via debt.
There are no experiments or historical documentation regarding an economy with a currency that is a controlled, decreasing inflation (yes, bitcoin is not deflationary. It is a controlled inflation) preprogrammed and that cannot be interfered with to my knowledge.
I am not saying you are necessarily wrong. I am simply saying the theoretical circumstance has not happened because there are many factors that would simply not exist in a theoretical Bitcoin economy and you cannot directly apply economics that consider only the current system.

There was no evidence that was a buy. Money moved from one address to another.
To me, the receiving address looked like an exchange's, what with all the batch transactions. Saw no posts or articles proving otherwise.

Based on previous patterns (~$1 bubble, ~$20 bubble-$30 was an exchange error/pump, ~$200 bubble, ~$1000 bubble), it will likely crash as low as 2k before reaching 25k during the bubble popping. It will also likely hit 10k before crashing.
In 5 years, it will likely be higher than 100k, unless the most recent 4 year wait for the current bubble is an indication of lengthening time between bubbles. In which case, it will likely have climbed back to 5-9k in preparation for the next 100k bubble.

I would personally never post a picture of my daughter on Reddit. If I did, the face would be censored. Nor would I link to my personal YouTube account. Even though that was deleted, a bot scraped it and repeated. 


I think a story would have gone over better than a picture and brief description. 


In my opinion, that would be bad. You are then just teaching her daddy can solve her financial problems. Of course, I am making assumptions and only know what you told me in this paragraph but I feel it could be a good opportunity to teach not to invest more than you can lose. A few people have told me stories about how they lost minor amounts of money in stocks when they were under 10 years old because their parents introduced them to the market and gave them the option of investing in something. Or gave them the money to do so. 




Especially in the Bitcoin community, many have learned to watch out for scams. You will be accused as such no matter what you do. For me, personally, I suspect as such because I can't fathom a rational person posting a picture of their own daughter on the internet, especially on Reddit.

Some interesting things to note:
* In Canada, government agencies no longer accept cash - at least ServiceOntario stopped a few years back.
* Those who think "legal tender" must be accepted misunderstand the "legal" part of "legal tender."
* This is Canada so the silver coloured coins you see in those rolls are NOT quarters. They are $2 coins.
Things like this make me question - albeit not seek the true answers because it doesn't directly affect me. Nothing changes because it doesn't directly affect the majority of people so they can ignore those who complain. Some things to ponder:
* If I am denied bank cards, how can I get my driver's license/ health card renewed? They don't accept cash.
* I need two pieces of ID to get a driver's license and for a lot of other things. It seems like some things would be difficult without. Are some people in a situation where they can't provide sufficient ID to get some of the things they need?
* A large issue with homelessness is not having an address. Think about how much you can't do unless you provide a valid permanent residence. That includes banking.

That's not how quantum computing works. It gives a bunch of specific types of calculations a huge speedup. It is not a general overall compute speedup.


SHA256 is most definitely not one of those things. But let's humour this with some "other" kind of computational leap.
Well, we can't because it already happened. Check out the Wikipedia article on ASIC. This is a chip designed to do one thing really well from the ground up and that is it. Due to this, it will outperform, at the same power, anything a general compute device could do.


You fundamentally misunderstand how Bitcoin mining scales in the same way the people who call for more efficient hardware think it will reduce the power consumption spent on Bitcoin.
I have a computer with 4 video cards and it takes 1000W. So does everyone else. I can mine 1 BTC per day. The speed is 1.2 GH/s
Now an ASIC comes out that can do 0.3GH/s, consumes 5W and is the size of a USB stick.
I buy 200. Why? Because I'm replacing the physical space of the video cards I used to use and the power I used to use.
Now I can do 60GH/s for 1000W. I'm still making 1 BTC/day. Why? Because everyone else did what I did and the difficulty adjusted upwards. I am finding blocks at the same speed as before. This is simplistic and not exactly what happened due to human/ corporate factors but it illustrates best how the difficulty adjusts.


But it doesn't. Because you aren't manufacturing this equipment nor are you setting the prices for them. Those with access to design teams and semiconductor connections are. The mining incentives adjust in such a way as to reach an equilibrium of just barely not profitable for all but the people with access to the lowest overhead, including upfront costs. Ergo, equipment manufacturers might compete a bit but their consumer prices will always be unprofitable for most people because if they lowered them too much, then they might as well not sell them and instead mine with them themselves.
If you want a deep look into this, all you have to do is study the history of the Bitcoin ASIC. What you are asking has literally already happened and cannot happen again to such a large degree.
As for the effect on price - that is still up for debate if there was any causation or even real correlation. If anything, most will agree price affects mining, not the other way around. Just as price made developing ASICs a worthwhile upfront cost for those first few companies.

Simple doesn't mean most efficient. Simple means least confusing.
There is nothing *incorrect* about my advice, even if you disagree with it and prefer a different approach or are blessed with more knowledge of OP's situation/ capabilities than myself. You are free to disagree with my advice but save comments like this for when advice is actually incorrect and not just something you disagree with. Unless something I said actually is incorrect? In which case, you didn't address it.
I addressed my opinion on this approach for an OP that didn't appear tech savvy:


TLDR; I suspected OP would have more problems with simple console commands than they would just waiting a couple days, then pressing "send."

Why? Why would hundreds of developers stop working on Bitcoin and millions of users and investors who don't know the first thing about I.T. suddenly decide to become active? The voting turnout for the USA is regularly around 50%. Few of those people even understand much about politics. People are apathetic. Unless something happens that is not fixable, no one will do anything. It will be less underwhelming than the BCH off-shoot.
Your second paragraph indicates you have the same misunderstandings about the difficulty that the OP does.
Of course, your comment actually starts to make sense when one realizes it is just a segway for the strangely upvoted comment about a "quantum proof" altcoin.

There are 3 forms of credentials. For secure environments it is recommended to always require two:
* something you know - ex. password
* something you have - ex. token, key card
* something you are - ex. biometrics
Something you are, such as biometrics, cannot be changed and can be stolen. Even the measures Apple put in place on their iPhones were [bypassed]( rather quickly. Biometrics has its place as *part* of security but should not be *all* of security.
Biometrics true practical purpose is for better ease of use, *not* better security. Let's take a couple use cases just to prove that point:
* Most bank employees who work off-site use RSA tokens and passwords to connect to the VPN to work.
* a common modern punch device for part time employees employs a fingerprint scanner for employees to punch in and out of work.
In the end, biometrics are basically like **a password that cannot be changed** that is easier to use with the proper hardware.

Why should a decentralized, large group of developers care what a bunch of non-developers are talking about outside of the regular discussion channels they use for every other decision?
It's like if a bunch of businessmen got together in new York without any politicians and decided to increase property taxes by a flat 5%, called it the "New York Agreement" and told everyone via social media that it was going to happen.

The only reason Bitcoin appears deflationary is due to the fluctuating price and speculation. The currency itself is a controlled inflation of about 657k coins per year and the rate halves approximately every 4 years. The end-game is neutral, not deflationary.

It was a propaganda ploy to catch people and gain attention.
1. Fork BCH.

3. BCH supporters support 2x and make it seem as if they will accept it over BCH.
4. 2x obviously doesn't happen. BCH supporters call foul and propaganda BCH again.
5. The whole mess draws attention to BCH and makes it seem like the developers pulled a bait-and-switch, causing misleading support for BCH.

Oh yay, I thought. Time to resume buying from newegg, I thought. Hey guys, check out how easy it is to pay with Bitcoin, I smugly announced to the people around me.
Click Bitcoin as I always had. Got the QR code as I always had. It seemed oddly larger. Scanned it with Coinomi. Error. Not recognized. Scanned it with my QR code reader, which read it and then opened Coinomi. Not recognized.
How fucking embarrassing. Well, those people want nothing to do with Bitcoin ever again. Forget the technicals. Forget the details. **This** (paying simply with a QR code via a popular wallet to a popular payment processor to a popular site) **worked** just 6 months prior. The services were in place all along the chain so to the end customer, everything *just worked*.
I don't bloody care who's responsible. I just want to pay.
BIP70 is a [defined protocol]( **Coinomi** - Implement it.
BIP70 isn't used by many wallets. Heck, I'm reading reports of people not being able to pay due to complications despite using a supported wallet, like cloudflare issues. **Bitpay** - give me a fallback address/method.
Surely you must be noticing complaints. **Newegg** - add another processor or change to an entirely different processor.
There's a rumour BIP70 is redundant and shouldn't be a protocol. If this is true, **Bitcoin dev team** - get rid of it.

The underlying technology is not. The false propaganda incited by people like Roger Ver is misleading. This is the [scam]( and due to the high number of provably fake accounts and mass of likely fake accounts, it is difficult to gauge how successful the scam has been so far.
The premise is still hard to determine but it seems Bitmain is the main player, hoping to pump BCH and dump it slowly at higher prices maintained by victims.
It is hard to believe but also possible they hope to actually gain enough confidence to flip and become Bitcoin. This seems very optimistic of them but would explain why there haven't been significant dumps so far.

That's not quite how it works. The current system is rigged to make the rich richer. How else does inflation go up each year *less* than the actual amount of new money issued would indicate?
You think it's an undodgeable tax on wealth? It's not. The ability to make money simply by having money (and being able to better game the system the more money you have) is exactly that. When Uncle Scrooge is invested in a portfolio only available to people with a few million or more to invest, he dodges this tax so much he makes profit. Meanwhile the middle-class who decide to look into the system get the crumbs and still fully dodge it.
The middle-class who don't look into this lose money (difference between inflation rate and savings account interest rate).
The poor can't be part of this system as most entry points have minimums. Unlike everyone else, they can't dodge inflation and are affected the most. By being paid the least, inflation affects them the most until minimum wage increases. Their pay scale doesn't have a built-in barrier by paying them more than they need to live.


This is a misguided statement. The issue isn't the 1% having all the money. The issue is the 1% being in a position of power to get all the money and keep getting it. The issue is the debt-based system hanging over everyone except those in power who make money off of screwing the world. 
Some people being significantly more wealthy than others is only a problem in our current system. It happens in Bitcoin but it is not a *problem* in Bitcoin. At the very least, unarguably, the existence of a wealth gap in Bitcoin isn't and won't be anywhere near as problematic to the less-well-off as it is in the current system.

Mr R Gnome is confused about what OP is stating. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 15:58:58
Most of these comments are pretty short. I'm interested in reading some stories. So here's mine. 
I missed the "gold rush" of the summer of 2011 but started mining on and off when I got my HD 6950. But I didn't expand much because even the most efficient $/MH cards weren't worth the purchase because it would still take 5+ months to pay them off. Started mining litecoin mid-2012 and immediately exchanging it for bitcoin. Was ok for CPU mining back then. I added a Radeon 5830 for 24-h mining on a spare board with the board box as the case. It went down for 2 weeks that December when two Kingston USB sticks failed (my primary and my hot-swap spare) and I decided to study for exams instead of writing BAMT to a new USB. 
I almost spent it all on a laser pointer online at a shop in early 2012 when I still didn't have such confidence in Bitcoin. I wanted to see a store transaction. I went with the wrong company for mining preorder - BFL. With some lucky doubling down, I managed to make all my money back plus a bit. Fun but less effort had I not gotten involved in the first place. 
In early-mid 2013, I mined litecoin with the same video cards as I used to mine Bitcoin. Didn't sell it for Bitcoin. Got in on a small KNC miner with a partner and made a small profit or at least broke even. We ordered another one but it was late. Fortunately, KNC was doing refunds in Bitcoin but denoted in USD. Price went down a bit from purchase date and fortunately managed to make a bit of coin on it.
At some point in 2014 or 2015, I packed my last miner in a box because it was making virtually nothing. The end of Bitcoin accumulation. HODLed by sticking my head in the sand until the most recent bubble.
So I've been HODLing since late 2011. I missed too many opportunities. But I consider myself lucky because at the same time, I made back what I lost from any mistakes (like BFL). The biggest regret, of course, comes from early 2012 after my "aha" moment with crypto. Someone suggested I put $1k into it at $4 if I believed in it. I didn't put my money in because I felt invested enough by hobby mining. Having not yet had a full-time job (or even part time much above minimum wage) and not being a person to take risks, it seemed like a lot of money. That could have been 250BTC.
But I am happy to have a position and continue to HODL. I sold a tiny bit near the high in December. These days, selling Bitcoin feels more risky than buying it to me. I will probably always HODL the majority.

I have no issue with a blocksize increase. The Devs have no issues with a properly prepared and executed blocksize increase. In an open-source decentralized project, major changes happen slowly. A bubble brings that to light.

The "killer app" to which he would be referring to is not "permissionless borderless instant money." He is referring to the use and evolution of it. Now, the idea of a "killer app" is not something I completely understand, especially when it differs based on opinions. But I can tell you that apps in this context would refer to things like bitpay in that bitpay operates with the Bitcoin network in the background.
My favourite example is an 80s documentary on the personal computer. It's available on YouTube but I don't remember the name or the exact quote. He was asked something along the lines of what you could do with a computer and why you would want one in your home. The examples he gave or the reasons for it didn't seem great but what he also said was that the computer was like the engine/motor. At first people ask, "why would I want this and what would I use it for." It kind of fades because no one uses it but then someone puts it in a car. Now people see how great it is for a car and think, "ok, that's what it's for." But people are closed-minded. Engines/motors have so many uses and can be used for so many things. Computers, engines/motors and, I suspect future Bitcoin, are in a lot of things people couldn't dream of when they were first invented. So I agree with him in that regard. Bitcoin has so much unused potential and things people couldn't dream of.
To use the computer as an analogy, we are in the 80s and you think the computer as-is, a desktop machine capable of basic calculations and programs as such is its "killer app" when, in fact, in 30 years the computer will be in everything and have so many more uses. Today people use computers either without thought or without realization.

As someone who looked briefly into it but not enough to make a solid decision on if it is a viable long-term platform, I am interested in OP's personal answer to this. I stopped paying attention after the code problems leading to the unexpected transfer and any interest I had to look more into it was shaken by the decision to change a past transaction.
At a glance, it seems to me like Ethereum is doing too much in one platform and is too specific to succeed. Building its functions in layers on a platform like Bitcoin makes more sense to me.
That said, consider that an opinion from an outsider looking in. I say it because I want to hear from those who have studied it more and either do or do not believe in the viability of the platform.

Great response. Although sources aren't given, I believe most of it and remember the rest from when it happened.
Thing is, unless something happens again, it really doesn't matter. Not saying that's a good thing but seeing as how ETH recovered so well, it certainly seems to be the case.
Purely from an investment standpoint, my opinion doesn't matter. The opinion of everyone else matters. The most important thing to take away is the knowledge that there is some additional risk in investing in ETH as per historically observable.

In most cases when someone sees an asset jump in value, then buys in, they have already missed the boat. Look what *just* happened with Litecoin. People were all over reddit talking about how they were going to ride it short-term to $75. It's crashing like mad. In general, if there is a hype about something, it is too late. I am not saying that is what is happening with Bitcoin right now. But it could be.
*If* you buy now, be prepared to keep it as a long-term investment. If you are unfamiliar with Bitcoin, now is the time to learn about it, both the tech and financial history so you can make your own analysis as to if and when you should invest.
You should not take advice from anyone who tells you yes or no here.


You should be researching and learning so you can make that decision yourself. No one can advise you, especially since they don't know your financial circumstances, if you are a short-term or long-term investor, if price swings make you nervous, etc.

Litecoin went way up prior to SegWit. SegWit activation itself is no reason for the price to jump. Once people realize this after SegWit, they will panic. Because nothing will have effectively changed to keep the price at that high.

That's a hype thing. The actual highs were 30, 250, 1100 and 19000. The point is the mentality of the power of 10. After each bubble, we have never legitimately gone below the previous factor of 10 of the last high. We aren't going below 1k, for example. We never went below 100, for example. As for 2011, the zero value was a problem on one exchange. We never went below $1.
Think about it. During 2014, we never went below $100 even though it was the one and only time even Andreas Antonopoulus thought Bitcoin might die and have to be rebuilt.

Amazing how many people think the government are the ones issuing new currency.
Hint: The fed is not a government organization. They "print" money and loan it to banks and the government. The government taxes the people for services and useful things but also a large portion goes to repaying their debt to the fed.
Hint: things aren't quite as OP says but the end effect is an extra inflation tax. Government doesn't benefit from this directly; only indirectly via their loans being easier to pay off over time as inflation increases.
Hint: Things would easier if the government were in control as you seem to think they are. But they aren't. The IMF and the FED are and have been for a long time.

1 and 2 result in Central point of failure as you have no backups and each location contains _different_ data.
3 is the same but worse because of the potential of the flash memory failing or corrupting data.
Keep it simple. In general, most people lose access to things due to their own stupidity or by overcomplicating things, not due to theft.
In other words, yes theft prevention is important but what is more important is protecting the seed from your own potential of losing them or completely locking out access to the beneficiary.

Not saying you are one or that this is happening.
But if I were in Roger's position with his intentions to push BCH and make money, I would have fake accounts on both sides to make it seem like there is a lot of legitimate debate. It would also allow me to control the arguments people see on the BTC side and push ones that are false or easy to contradict to make BCH accounts sound like they have a sound argument.
I'd push more on both sides during strategic times to garner attention (negative attention is still attention and can be manipulated into positive attention due to having accounts "debating" on both sides) such as during price increases or when things have been quiet for a while.
And I'm going to add this on to prevent myself from being downvoted: I'll probably be downvoted for this post.

Although that is a valid sentence, it is a bit awkward and I believe doesn't quite convey the meaning you intended. "Affects" or "have an effect on" is more correct and less confusing.
It's kind of like you are saying you have a list of things that cause the price to happen rather than saying you have a list of things that can change the price.
As for the list, although it is accurate, I think it's easily summarized as "supply and demand." Maybe you could consider using supply and demand as factors and have what you listed as sub-factors? Especially since the factors you listed seem kind of disorganized and possibly dynamic. I think putting them into those two categories would be a lot better.

Your link titles were very interesting and I really wanted to read them. But they don't match the contents linked.


I was especially interested in the "centralized and unsecure" link but it was just to a whole subreddit. Could you be more specific so I don't have to sift through shit to find the well-written articles with proper research?


The term "unsecure" does not appear in that article. Nor does "secur*"


Here's where I start to lose interest and suspect you might be a troll, which would be unfortunate because I do want to read information proving or disproving what you've claimed. I guess I'll find out if you are or not from your response, which may or may not lead to good discussion. Why do I lose interest? Because I read the same shit online about Bitcoin for years (your words, not the links) especially related to the Silk Road. So hearing it here for Ethereum makes me wonder if it even matters.
I am well aware of what happened with DAO and was extremely disappointed with what the decision to do the hard fork. But that's over now. And the money is still in Ethereum. Maybe it will come back to bite them but really, it's been a year. If Ethereum were to die or be ignored, it would have happened by now. And your second link is back to the ethereumfraud subreddit. I again ask you to be more specific because I have browsed that subreddit before and most posts seemed rather toxic and unsubstantiated and/or poorly researched (not meaning misinformation, more meaning lack of information).

1. Move the BTC first in a transaction to a new wallet.
2. Move the BCH second in a transaction to a new wallet.
3. Move the BSV (and any other forks you want) last in a transaction to a new wallet.
The order is important to protect your coins in order of their value but furthermore, BSV has less protections for this sort of thing.

Most of the people who mine are NOT paying the prices you see listed. They are manufacturing them. Those prices you see vary based on the price of Bitcoin and the hashrate. There is a fundamental flaw in trying to use those prices for the purpose you are trying to use them for. Those are the prices they are willing to sell to YOU.
Manufacturing costs for them don't get higher and will continue to fall but they also must scale and research. The prices YOU see are prices that go up and down based on the market and their profits.

@_date: 2019-05-13 16:27:50
Always work in percentages.
Percentage of net worth.
Percentage of yearly income.
Everyone's situation is different. But percentages are the same.
\&gt; Holy shit bitcoin went up 200 in like 5 mins
Welcome to Bitcoin. This is common. The opposite is also common.
\&gt; Will I make at least 10k by holding it
Oftentimes, you can ask others for advice because being an expert in their field, the will know the answer.
However, with any price action and market, no one can know the answer.
You absolutely must research and come to your own conclusions and understand that even if something is likely, it isn't guaranteed.
One piece of advice: Do not let large price movements up and down affect your judgements. Don't invest more than you can lose. Or, if you intend to hold long-term, don't invest more than an amount below what will prevent you from living comfortably.
A final advice - never sell all of it (back to percentages). Sell in percentages of Bitcoin that you have, when you start selling. Otherwise, it might feel like "not much" at some point and you'll mentally revert to just selling it all.
This is actually harder to do when you are thinking about "0.4" BTC. So might be best to move the decimal place over a bit and see how that changes your perspective (eg. move the decimal place over 6 spots and you have 400,000uBTC, which is commonly referred to as a "bit" and whereby ten "bits" is currently worth about 8 cents)
@_date: 2019-05-18 20:45:12
\^ This right here is an example of how BCH trolls have managed to brainwash normal people into thinking Bitcoin isn't an electronic peer-to-peer cash system.
By repeating over and over that it isn't and that BCH is, people either start looking into BCH because they believe the lie or they become supporters of this new idea that "Bitcoin is only digital Gold," another way of showing they believe the lie.
It's pretty simple, psychologically. By hearing the keyword "cash" or "peer-to-peer electronic cash" over and over in regards to BCH and in negative intonations towards Bitcoin, people either end up thinking positively on "Cash and BCH" or negatively on "Cash and BCH," unconsciously associating the two one way or the other.
Therefore, some people who support Bitcoin and hear the word "Cash" automatically picture that BCH association and go into defensive mode saying Bitcoin doesn't need to be cash - ie buying into the lie that Bitcoin doesn't act as Cash.
Roger Ver's Speeches are very powerful on this psychological front. He repeats his talking points and keywords, misleading people through repetition.
The end result is that some people who are against BCH are also, ironically, now against the idea that Bitcoin is an electronic peer-to-peer cash system.

I'll admit I only skimmed. That post is stupidly long.
I'm also not going to research each coin he mentions for you. You can do that yourself to answer your question fully. I can, however, throw out some points that stand out to me that I already know about.
* I did look into IOTA. To put it simply, IOTA in future has plans to be decentralized via the removal of their centralized control thing. This has been delayed. Over and over.
* " Sharding for consensus " he keeps saying. I haven't looked into these coins but sharding is a method spreading splitting up a database to spread out the load. Ethereum has talked about using it. It has absolutely nothing to do with "for consensus."
* He mentions side-chains as if they affect decentralization of the chain. He doesn't seem to know what he is talking about or maybe he doesn't know what decentralization is.
And finally let me address directly the only comment he makes about Bitcoin:
\&gt; Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Monero, Verge because 51% of their hashing power is controlled by 2 entities Bitmain and another pool. 
Bitmaintech has only made ASICs that cover the algorithms used by Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and Dogecoin (from his list). They might have made ASICs for Monero and Ethereum at some point, I don't know. I do know that there are no significantly more powerful ASICs for Monero/Ethereum than vs CPUs and GPUs so scaling like that using their own ASICs would still be difficult. As for Verge, Scrypt is only one of the algorithms that can be used to mine it.
I haven't even talked about his claim that They and another entity control all the mining power. This seems to come from nowhere. There have been points where there have been concerns but nowhere near this.
But anyway, look for yourself  [ 
At best (as of this post) Bitmain MIGHT control all of the [BTC.com]( Unknown and Antpool from this chart. 
So running an attack is expensive no matter how much power you have. You technically could run a more difficult attack with 33%. But you would need a way to make money off of it worth more than all the coin you would be mining with that 33-50%. It's simply not a real concern but people should still bring attention to it and we should be aware of it.
Anyway, I think his worst thing was that he didn't define the type of decentralization at the start. This allowed him to write a bullshit list.

Thanks! Although, I think their choice was probably better. I don't know anything about these two devices but at least the cruzer with the extra space has a chance of using better flash and a better controller.
Regardless though, at least the used Crucial flash (I'm pretty sure sandisk is a subsidiary of micron or uses their flash or something) so that's a +1 for potential reliability. Unfortunately information like that and endurance testing on regular flash drives is not readily available.
The device does seem a bit overpriced, in that case. $150 is good ($35 pi + $10 psu + $30 usb + $10 microsd + $20 case + $45 to cover overhead - all assuming low enough volume they don't get any bulk discounts) but their "regular" $250 is way over the top.
They mention a lot about an app store kind of deal but don't seem to have a real vision for it. I'll need to see more once they evolve a bit.
On the plus side, reading this blog encouraged me to set my Bitcoin node up again in a VM on my server. I've set the size of the drive to 120GB, which realistically won't last much more than a year, however. I figure I'll make a new one by then though and have migrated to larger drives for my VMs. On a side note, I've opened port 8333 on my router to the node and set maxconnectioncount to 16 but I still only have 8 connections. Anyone have any thoughts? Or could there be a separate maxconnectioncount that applies when still syncing?

2011 ATH (1) - $1.00
2011 ATH (2) - $31.91

2013 ATH (2) - $1242.00
2017 ATH - $19,666.00
peak-peak are as follows (days)
I never did the math on bottom-top pricing multiplier as I find that to be a useless metric. A better metric in my opinion is not to compare bottom to top with multipliers but simply know that each bubble will top above one significant digit more than the previous. Anything beyond that is variance. I do not look to try to predict what the top will be as I consider that random, based on what happens socially during the bubble, which cannot be predicted. I only know it will be above 100K because the herd will push that big round even number hard once they know it's going up.

You're missing the point. NiceHash doesn't have that amount of hash rate to sell. And the big mining companies aren't selling more than they use to mine, themselves.
You'd need to get a design team and get wafers done. Then you'd need to support the electrical and physical hosting cost of all that equipment. And since that would take time, you'd need to base your estimate on future total hashpower instead of present hashpower.
So yea, it costs WAY more than $1m/hr to operate that.

I do see the logical misunderstanding about how things work that you are having. However, I am unsure the best way to explain it to you such that you understand.
There are also several smaller misunderstandings I feel you may or may not be having and without being sure you are having them, I don't want to go through them all.
So a quick comment.
Buying will cause the price to increase. As the "trading pool" is made of BTC and Fiat, whereby you are saying the BTC would be reduced, you are misunderstanding the divisibility of Bitcoin, I believe.
1. Shrinking the amount of BTC does not lower volume in USD because it causes an increase in price. Trades will remain the same but in lower BTC amounts. This will not lower trade volume.
2. Again, you will not have lower amount of people owning coins. You will just have the same increasing adoption of lowering amounts. More people will own coins, just smaller amounts. Again back to the divisibility.
If you want a real-world example, just delve into the histories of the bitcointalk forums when BTC was &lt; $1 each. If what you are saying was logical, then we would have a lower volume now than back then but as you can clearly see now (hopefully), your logic is flawed.

In my opinion, you are chasing greed.
Bitcoin itself is a high-risk investment with high potential returns.
Anyone offering "interest" on this can't possibly last.
Do you seek "interest" on your apple stock or Nvidia stock? No. Because interest is (usually) guaranteed return. Your return with Bitcoin is a non-guaranteed return via the price increasing, like apple or Nvidia stock.
Anyone so far to try to offer "interest" on Bitcoin has been a scam, either in the short-term or the long-term. In order to pay you interest, they need to make money faster than the Bitcoin price is increasing.
I am going to bring up my skepticism of Celius now. They sound a lot like BST ( [ ) but with a new slant - lending.
I personally find it extremely difficult to believe that in the current market there is as much of a demand for loans in Bitcoin as Celcius claims (or moreover, that there is more of a demand for loans than for people who want to loan their crypto). And those interest rates earned on every account by investors are rather high - in fact, the top (7%) just so happens to be the exact same percentage BST advertised. High interest on an asset that doesn't lose its own value over time is a huge red flag.
I watched an interview with the owner on GMC. It struck me as suspicious.
Now, I will admit I have never used Celcius and my investigation into it has been surface only but a couple more suspicious things strike me:
* no compounding interest. ok but combine this with withdrawals being deposit-first instead of interest-first and you essentially have a huge incentive to keep funds in more than you normally would and prevent investors from withdrawing the interest as they go.
* freely admit they haven't been audited and say they are going to be "in the future"
I digress. Back to your question.
You clearly invested in Bitcoin as an investment to make gains on your USD value. You are now getting impatient and want to make money while waiting. This is a trap.

That is NOT the point of his metaphor and you know it.
We are not debating the usefulness of Bitcoin here. His metaphor was very clear but you refuse to see past something that has nothing to do with his metaphor.
And then you try to deflect ME, as well. I don't know if you are doing this on purpose or you are really just that dense.
If you really are interested in what I think, I replied to another of your comments.


Bitcoin's price is determined by buyers and sellers. Your entire thesis appears to be based on the assumption that miners will buy BTC to prop up the price. This is not a sustainable business model and is a risk that doesn't make sense to me. They make money by mining BTC at economical rates (which I think you far overestimate based on your "price floor") then sell mining equipment at just barely not profitable prices to everyone else.
Another of your flaws is even looking at mining hardware prices. The only thing that matters is electricity prices. Mining hardware (or in reality fabrication costs for them) is a one-time thing. ie. it only matter when you are expanding. Why would they buy BTC to keep such a high price floor? They'd instead just not expand. Or sell their equipment down to what it's actually worth (hint: it's not worth much at all hardware-wise)

1. He never says Bitcoin isn't decentralized. He simply rates it lower than other coins by his analysis of decentralization.
2. His analysis of decentralization is wrong and stupid and only takes one thing into consideration. (eg. he rates IOTA as top tier decentralize when actually, in its current state, it is not decentralized at all).
3. Anyone who has "S" as the top tier plays far too many Asian video games and probably shouldn't be trusted in this matter.
4. You posted this as if you are supporting his viewpoint but when responding to comments, you act as if you are neutral. Make up your mind. Either make an appropriate title asking if he has good points and saying you want to learn more or stick to your point that you think he makes good points.

People looking at charts say its overbought.
History says we will go to 10K within the next 6 months, then enter a 100K bubble.
If you are investing in something, it is YOUR job to answer this question. It is irresponsible to try to get others to answer it for you.


As per above, do your own research.


That's your decision. You don't want this to be on anyone else if it ends up being a bad call.
Also, only you can make those kinds of decisions because only you understand your risk/reward tolerance. I've personally spent hours upon hours writing down in advance what I will do at each price-point that is possible in the future so I have no regrets and so I can keep a cool head when it happens.


I'll give specific advice to this one, although it is my thoughts and might not sit well with you.
Your previous statement indicated you were interested in a short-term trade, not long-term. Why? Because Bitcoin moves extremely quickly. You could hit that 10K or that 7K within the next couple weeks.
If you really, truly, are interested in a long-term play, buy less than you said you were prepared to and keep it until it hits a much higher number than 10K or keep it forever and consider it sunk money. And if it does go up in price, I recommend a staggered exit via percentage such that no matter what happens, you always have some stake in BTC (for example, sell 10% at each target price)
But consider, that's just what works for me.


Except you don't know that. You also don't know about after that. This to me sounds like the trap I saw so many people go through during the last bull run. People would get in at 8K, sell at 10K in order to buy back in later but then it never went low enough so they had to buy back in at 15K, losing money. But then the price dumps and they missed selling at 20K and now it's back down at 8K except they had less BTC than they had when they first bought at 8K because of the trading.
That's the trap you're setting yourself up for by thinking you can predict the market. You can never "know" what it's going to be.


As a long-term investment, many people just buy. Always. To avoid the swings, many buy in every day or week consistently, no matter the price.


Many people are hopeful on a rise. I am, so consider that I am biased.
Rather than sell at emergency sell points, many simply buy more. This strategy is only possible if you don't invest a lot right off the bat. Sure, you might end up with a higher average buy-in price if you wait and it goes up but the long-term play with Bitcoin is mostly based around an increase of an order of magnitude bigger than seen before. That's the long-term bet for many.

You are literally taking the wrong thing from his metaphor.
In his metaphor, the "price floor" is the cost to create one widget. 
He's not debating the value of Bitcoin just like he's not debating the value of the "widget."
But if you are turning this into a "bitcoin always has value because of its usefulness as a transfer of value" then your analysis of the "price floor" is clearly looking at the wrong metric.
You can't argue that a price floor is based on how much it costs to make a widget, then turn around and say the widget will always have value because of its use case.

\^ This right here is an example of how BCH trolls have managed to brainwash normal people into thinking Bitcoin isn't an electronic peer-to-peer cash system.
By repeating over and over that it isn't and that BCH is, people either start looking into BCH because they believe the lie or they become supporters of this new idea that "Bitcoin is only digital Gold," another way of showing they believe the lie.
It's pretty simple, psychologically. By hearing the keyword "cash" or "peer-to-peer electronic cash" over and over in regards to BCH and in negative intonations towards Bitcoin, people either end up thinking positively on "Cash and BCH" or negatively on "Cash and BCH," unconsciously associating the two one way or the other.
Therefore, some people who support Bitcoin and hear the word "Cash" automatically picture that BCH association and go into defensive mode saying Bitcoin doesn't need to be cash - ie buying into the lie that Bitcoin doesn't act as Cash.
Roger Ver's Speeches are very powerful on this psychological front. He repeats his talking points and keywords, misleading people through repetition.
The end result is that some people who are against BCH are also, ironically, now against the idea that Bitcoin is an electronic peer-to-peer cash system.

Alert you when to purchase Bitcoin? Literally any price tracking phone app has a "price alert" notification option or just open bitcoinity or cryptowatch or tradingview, go to the options and set an alert to whatever price you want.
Or better yet, put in a buy or sell order for the price you want. You don't have to wait for it to be reached. That's not how market trading works.
Edit: If your wording was misleading and you meant a trading bot that trades based on an algorithm, there are no guarantees with those for a few reasons. First off, the algorithm makes assumptions and is written by a human. Second, if lots of people are using the same one, it changes the outcome and could make it ineffective and third, it could just become ineffective due to market patterns changing. There is no magical way to predict the future, even with computers. Even with bots you rely on the idea of risk mitigation and assume you won't win more than 40% or 50% of your trades. That's how people trade, too unless they have insider information or enough money to manipulate a market.

This is such a common question that it might be deleted by the admins within the day.
Unfortunately the \[sidebar post\]([ hasn't been updated in 6 years.
Go ahead and read it though but consider the following updates
* You won't make ANY money GPU mining, rather than the little the post indicates
* CPUs cannot be used for Litecoin mining and neither, really, can GPUs
* The linked mining calculator seems to be using a broken API for fetching the difficulty. Google Bitcoin mining calculator and try a few
So, otherwise, definitely read what he said and the first few posts.
(side note, if any admins read this, we REALLY need an update to that link)
Now that that's out of the way, let's address your situation. First off, you provided very little detail on yourself, your situation and even exactly what Mac you have. Providing few details oftentimes wastes other people's time. I usually don't respond unless I'm feeling particularly bored because it necessitates me going into details and covering all possibilities.
In light of which, in order to waste less space in this comment, I have spent some time going through your post history in order to try to make some assumptions about you and what you want out of this.
Clearly you are new to Bitcoin. You heard about it somehow and want to mine for one reason or the other. 
* You are mining for profit: This endeavour is not profitable for most. The profit some people see actually entirely comes from price action in the market and these people would have been better off buying and selling at a later, higher point. Mining for profit properly requires scale and upfront cost as well as math and a clear understanding of how mining works and what will affect future profit. It is extremely difficult to predict future profit past about 6 months.
* You are mining as a way to learn more about Bitcoin in general: Mining is a great way to learn about Bitcoin, if that's what you are interested in learning about. It gives you the opportunity to set up equipment and understand how it works. You could get a little USB farm together for under $1000 and watch how everything works. You will never see that $1000 back, though.
Now that you understand that, let's bring this back to your Mac question. You didn't specify the model so I am going to assume a 2009 MacBook pro.
I actually can't speak to your hardware these days. I used Linux and Windows to CPU and GPU mine back in the day but never touched OSX for it. Unfortunately, even if you have a high-end GPU in that thing, it is unlikely you will be able to submit enough shares to actually register any hashrate on a pool so instead I am going to suggest altcoins. Note: you still won't make a profit. I'm addressing the assumption you are doing it for educational purposes.
Monero (XMR) has some pretty good software in the form of XMrig or XMR-stak. Both are open source and can be found on github. I am unsure if they support OSX. Consider bootcamp. This way you can see how things work. [supportxmr.com]( has some pretty good instructions and links to help as well as providing the service of a pool you will need. Not trying to shill any of this; I just happen to have experience mining XMR. If someone wants to pipe up with regards to modern Bitcoin software that supports GPUs or CPUs on OSX or even windows, that is another option.
Dedicated equipment isn't free but will give you the chance to perhaps submit enough shares to a pool to see satoshis going through (but probably not be able to withdraw them due to being a low amount). For this case, you could plug in a USB miner into your Mac. The Mac would control it while the miner device would do all the actual hashing.
Well, kind of at a dead-end here due to your lack of details. If you want, respond here and give us an idea of what you are looking to get out of mining or just Bitcoin in general. Perhaps some background on yourself and how you heard of Bitcoin could be useful. 
TLDR; It is 99% likely the answer to your question is "Don't" but I've provided above some information.

You don't import a private key to a bitcoin address. The private key is attached to one address. By importing the private key to your wallet, the public key is added and you have control of it because of the private key. 
What would happen is all the transactions and coins of that address are added to your wallet and you can spend from that address. 
@_date: 2019-05-05 03:19:53
If you have to ask, then the answer is no.
Finding out if mining is right for you involves a LOT of math and 99% of the time, you should come to the conclusion that the answer is no.
There's also the opinion part and you shouldn't be asking anyone else what they think the difficulty will be through your mining period. You need to make a decision yourself based on your opinions.

From their website:
\&gt; Using the prices NiceHash lists for different algorithms we are able to calculate how much it would cost to rent enough hashing power to match the current network hashing power for an hour. **Nicehash does not have enough hashing power for most larger coins**, so we also calculated what percentage of the needed hashing power is available from Nicehash
In other words, the site you linked does not compute the real costs to scale that high.

In the following, I am replacing your sentence "all the Bitcoins" with "most of the Bitcoins" since you treat your question as if you are asking about "most of the Bitcoins" eg:




Then what effect do you suppose this would have? If it doesn't affect the market as you say, then ummm... nothing?


If it is a long term operation and he doesn't sell any of his coins then he would simply have the most value in the market. The remaining coins' value would be determined in the same way they are now. Obviously the price would increase slowly because of demand caused by him.


Clearly not. Because of:




Are you sure "liquid" is the word you are looking for? I don't see how someone buying up Bitcoins slowly over time reduces the liquidity of the Bitcoins I own. Actually, it would make bitcoins *more* liquid, until he stops buying.
The only thing I can think of is a confidence loss in Bitcoin if the majority is held by a single entity. Is your thought experiment about the consequences of said confidence loss? This confidence loss would only occur, of course, if all the collected coins were held by a single address so as to be publicly seen by anyone who looks at the blockchain.

First, bitcoin isn't there to replace cash.
But, let's take a quick look:
We already use credit and debit cards extensively instead of cash because the infrastructure is there. In Japan, mobile phones with NFC are used because the infrastructure is there. I once saw a present-day tv show where someone tapped their phone to a vending machine. The hold-up in north america is the fucking banks and phone companies. CIBC is the first.
Bitcoin will start to replace cash in a similar way to credit and debit (assuming it becomes widely adopted) when the infrastructure is there.
The technology is there, just not the infrastructure. I recently sent 0.01BTC to a friend and had him send it back with our NFC equipped phones. It wasn't slow at all. Once the infrastructure is there, it will be that easy. This wasn't any slower than paper money, unless he handed me a 20. But more often than not, change needs to be made and exchanged with cash.

1. This is a common misconception. Bitcoin mining is a process of introducing Bitcoins into the economy at an ever decreasing rate with a hard limit of 21 million coins. Just know that the value has nothing to do with electricity. The value has to do with supply and demand like any other market.
It is important to make the distinction that mining is a specialized task done with specialized hardware by specialized people. For those who are new and want to learn: it can be a time consuming and financially risky hobby. Just because you are interested in Bitcoin, does not mean you should be interested in mining. Bitcoin general users do not mine.
2. Who knows? I've been with Bitcoin for a bit over a year and it seems to me that such value is a combination of it being undervalued after the crash of 2011 and of the sudden surge in new services this year, like Bitpay. As well as more media attention. I'm sure there are better economists out there who can shed more light.
3. Yes. There are several local exchanges that can hook you up with people in the same way kijiji does. Alternately, you can get into mining. This is a risky business for the technology literate though. In some places, you can even type Bitcoin into kijiji and get some hits.
4. Since Bitcoin is still so new, the businesses are all relatively small. I believe they may not be able to get the same bulk discounts as larger companies and have to deal with start-up costs. bitcoinstore.com is trying to sell things at cost to gain new customers.
5. bitcoin.org now lists several wallet recommendations with descriptions. click "see all bitcoin clients." Consider Electum or the Bitcoin Wallet for android.

This is an interesting post mainly because you got in early and forgot all about it. I think you deserve a longer answer that might diverge from your questions.
Some background on myself: I also got into Bitcoin in late 2011 (by your story, it sounds like you bought it after the 2011 crash). Unlike you, I looked into it greatly to learn what it's all about. I started mining and my whole interest was due to the structure of the technology and as a use for GPU compute for myself. I had my aha moment where I understood Bitcoin's permanency and value in early 2012. As a risk-adverse individual, I never bought any nor bought enough equipment to make any real amount of BTC but have held what I have since then. I buried my head in the sand from the crash of 2013 until the start of the next bull market in 2016. I do regret this because I missed out on so many developments and news and interesting things in the space during that period of time.
98 is a fantastic number to have because you have so many options and flexibility, even if you were poor in fiat now. My personal advice based on my experience in the market is as follows:
* First of all, let me get this out of the way: I personally believe Bitcoin will go to 100,000 this upcoming bull market within about 300-400 days from the bottom we saw early this year. I also believe down the line (within 5-10 years) we will see a 1 million bubble. My faith past these prices then waivers.
* There's lots of ways to approach this "exit strategy" whereby you manage risk while ensuring a profit you are happy with.
* You need to determine what you want to do based on your own individual risk tolerance/ financial situation/ greed profile. But the following are some observations:
* 98 is enough that you can take less than half and likely pay off any debts you might have while still maintaining the majority of your funds. If it were me, I wouldn't take more than half to do this, possibly leaving some debt on the house to stay in Bitcoin. But remember, I'm in Bitcoin long-term. You might decide not to be as per the next point. Personally, I view any price from now until maybe 12,000 as one "risk category" where if you don't think much of Bitcoin and want to get out, you can do this maybe a bit at a time as it goes up.
* You seem like you might be interested in Bitcoin as a technology. There's a lot of research you can do and a lot you can learn. While researching, focus some on the effects of Bitcoin being decentralized and learn a little about how our current monetary system works. You might want to keep some forever just as a way to keep yourself in the game and learning.
* If you do choose to keep the majority of your funds and stay in Bitcoin, you will become hopeful for a 100,000 bubble and a possible 1 million bubble down the line. When these happen, no one knows. And there is always risk it might not. But 100,000 might be a good time to get money out to guarantee your kids' college educations. You might be tempted to wait for the "top" as it keeps rising beyond 100,000 but it's not worth the risk. When it crashes, you won't think much difference between getting out at 100,000 and 200,000.
* Keep a reserve: Pick a number you like and keep it as a reserve so that you always have some (or, if you make poor decisions, instead of having no Bitcoin, you instead have your reserve). 10 is a nice round number. 21 is a fun gloating number.
* Maybe make goals &amp; price targets and sell when they reach them. Example:
   * 1. Pay off all debts: 15BTC = $225K and 83BTC remaining.
   * 2. Fill a college fund for two children1: 9BTC =$810K and 74BTC remaining.
   * 3. Enough to retire comfortably: 5BTC = $2.35M and 69BTC
   * Obviously this plan involves higher risk with the intention of keeping most of the BTC but you could adjust the plan to your liking. Having a plan and goal will help significantly with preventing your future self from panic selling and help mitigate regrets because you made the plan in advance. The important part of the plan is considering that anytime the price might drop, you want no regrets moving forward. The above plan is simple, but you could make a sliding plan whereby you sell amounts every time bitcoin jumps to work towards a goal to mitigate regret of it almost hitting your goal but crashing just before (eg, for  you could sell 2 each from 30K to 80K in steps of 5K, resulting in spending more than double the BTC but mitigating the risk by buying an average in between and still getting some out if it happens to crash in the middle.
* Many people would advise selling half now. That is good advice in many circumstance. Risk management. Consider selling a percentage you believe matches your risk profile instead, however. For me, 50% is too much. Others might prefer to sell a larger percentage each significant rise.
\&gt; Would selling and putting the money into stock market long term be better bet? 
This is a specific question that goes back to personal opinion. Traditionally, long-term low-risk stock market investments have been a good way to store value and avoid losing out due to inflation. You should probably consult a professional regarding the details and what you should invest into. Typically, though, returns outpacing inflation are common.
If you do this, I still advise keeping a reserve in BTC such that you don't have any regrets down the line. Risk management is something big to consider.
The number one thing is not regretting your choices. Always remember that things could have gone the other way. Remembering that and managing risk will help you make informed choices.
You probably want to know what I would do. Well, I have long-term faith and excitement about Bitcoin, as I mentioned. I've sold some to test exchanges but never made a real sell to make some profit until Bitcoin hit $15K in 2017. I only sold a small percentage. I intend to sell a larger percentage around 100,000 and not worry about it if I sell a bunch below 100,000 during the runup (risk management). I'll be holding the rest and sell a percentage again if it hits a million. With the 98BTC you have, this could translate into selling coin around each bubble top (don't try to call the real top) and using the resulting cash to sustain yourself until the next bubble. But that's only if the market cycles continue. And after doing your own research, you might disagree with my assumptions about what will happen.
So I've started going back and editing and adding and that's usually when things start to become too expanded and maybe lose focus. I'm going to finish this post now, as is. Just remember that there is a lot to consider and your possible regrets for each price movement in Bitcoin are important to your well-being. Manage those risks with your decisions. Most people should never go "all-in" or "all-out."

To add to this, it might be best to set multiple targets. Consider your own risk tolerances.
Carefully consider your exit strategy in advance.
* Pick a hodl reserve. (eg. 2BTC if you have 10BTC). Now double it. (eg. 4BTC)
* Pick a starting-to-sell price so you don't feel bad if you don't sell any at that price and it drops. Don't in any circumstance sell below this price.
* Pick prices for selling whereby you wouldn't feel to bad for selling whether it dropped or skyrocketed thereafter. (Eg. some people might like 0.1BTC every 10K after 10K until 100K then in 50K steps after 100K. This is just an example.)
* Basic idea is to minimize your regrets for each potential price movement. Carefully consider how you would feel if BTC dropped or jumped at each of your potential sell points.
* Give yourself some wiggle room directly in your plan because you will want to break your plan and this will make you feel like you are taking new unplanned risks while in reality you aren't. For example, in the above take that 0.1BTC at, say, 20K and say instead you are selling it between 20K-30K but make a hard limit of 30K whereby even if it looks to be going up, you sell anything you didn't already at 30K. So you get to make some decisions during that pricerange even though you already pre-determined your plan.
* Understand that you won't make as much as you would have if you were to have held everything until a higher price but that you should feel better for having mitigated risk.
* If you are left with only your hodl amount and the price increases so much that you have another goal you can fulfil with more fiat, sell half your hodl amount. This is why I said to double it before.
This is, of course, if you are ready to start exiting or want to dip into the funds some without hitting your potential future profit too hard. If you aren't done buying, you aren't at this stage.
If you aren't done buying: Don't sell at all. Every person I've known who has tried to time the market has lost. Some people have to learn this the hard way so if you are one of those, only play with 10% of what you were thinking of playing with before you read this post.
Carefully consider your exit prices in advance as per the points above. The point being, if BTC rises enough for a portion of it to be life-changing, you want to get out some but not everything. The amount is up to you. Your risks and regrets are up to you. But you cannot think rationally about this as the market is already moving up.
Never think about selling to "get back in" at a better price. Even if it would have worked out, you aren't patient enough to wait for it. Only sell to sell.
Like I said, this all varies person-to-person. Some people will massively regret holding and the price dropping more than they would regret selling and the price skyrocketing. This is why you pick amounts in advance and mitigate risk.

*True. And this is probably the largest. Services need to be built by companies to make Bitcoin more accessible and user-friendly. Bitpay is one example solution to a merchant problem. If we built it, they will come.
*The nature of Bitcoin. I don't really see this as a barrier to adoption by the general public. Note also though that new keypairs can be generated any time you want and unless you say you own the address, or use it from a traceable IP, there is no way to know who owns it.
*Good points but proven invalid by example of the large Linux community. It works. And if there is a need, someone will pay someone if necessary. (donations, corporate support, government support, foundation support, organization of people support).
*Not throwing energy away. This is an important part of the Bitcoin infrastructure; processing and validating transactions. It's like saying banks waste energy processing transactions with all their backend servers (general purpose). In the same vein, it's like saying we should stay with 1024 bit encryption because it uses less processing power than 2048, even though we need the security of 2048 these days (increasing hashrate).

I've been in the mining game for nearly two years, seriously for a bit over a year. I've started tracking difficulty, mining device manufacturers, and miners since January. If the price of Bitcoin does not change, according to my projections, you will make back half your money in one year, assuming you get your miner right this second. But... **52% of that return will come in the next 3 months.** The difficulty changes will make it such that in a year's time, I fully expect a Block Eruptor USB to only make $1-2 per day.
Whenever I look at investing in mining equipment, I ask myself if the equipment will pay itself back in under 6 months at the current price because if you think Bitcoin will go up in price and buy a miner based on that, you'd be better off buying Bitcoin directly and speculating.
I'm not saying don't get into mining but I am saying you need to do a lot more research and understand how Bitcoin works. en.bitcoin.it is a good place to start. As well as asking stupid questions on bitcointalk.org and even right here.
In fact, I recommend you GPU mine or order a single USB Block Eruptor in order to get experience in mining and learn about it more. You won't make your money back but you will learn a lot.

Currently, I still consider Bitcoin "high risk" "high reward"
It is not stable enough for store of value as such. In 5 years, you may find it worth not a whole lot or extremely valuable. Either way, do not expect it to stay at this price and do expect that if it ever hits this price again, it will be briefly on the way up or on the way down.
That said, 10% certainly wouldn't be unreasonable, in my opinion, if you are changing all your Euros into something else.

The actual sense of bitcoin mining with your current hardware now is educational value.

Ok first, (and I don't know why this hasn't been mentioned yet) you seem to not understand how bitcoin addresses work. the private/ public keypairs use ECDSA NOT SHA. SHA is just used for the blockchain and has nothing to do with your addresses (besides being part of the hashing process to produce your address from the private/public keypair. Your bitcoin address isn't even your public key).

Watch this from 7:50 until the end. I had something typed out but instead I realize this is better. It is absolutely relevant to your proposal.
Just want to add that your proposal is also circular logic. You are encrypting your seed and storing it where you can access it from anywhere provided you remember the password. That password must be secure. Very secure. So secure that... oh wait. You have to memorize it. Or write it down. And it should be as complicated as.... the seed in the first place.
Follow the standards. Instead of doing what you said, memorize your seed. Consider your brain as only ONE location of many for a backup.
The most important consideration for seed storage is backups and continued access through disasters and to prevent your own mistakes from losing you access to your own funds. Do not compromise this for a small chance of physical theft.

Improper grammar. Should be "affected"
All annoyances aside, I don't follow the logic of this website. Instead of mining for themselves, they are mining for others at a reduction in profit AND having to pay the additional cost of running the website. Their FAQ on "is this site or is Bitcoin a ponzi scheme" only answers the question about Bitcoin, not about the site.
Then there are the inconsistencies. Their servers section describes supposedly one server with 3 motherboards they supposedly run at their local datacenter. But their "how it works" section claims they purchase time from a mining company and keep 70% for themselves and give the rest to those who send them BTC. The website was registered last month for only one year from godaddy and the owner's information is hidden. This doesn't mean much by itself but the basic idea just says ponzi unless they can prove that they are not paying back users with other user's money. I'm just putting myself in their shoes. If I wanted profit for the short-term, I would ask people for money with the claims on the site, then keep something like 5-10% for myself and pay back users with the other 90-95% to keep it going and try to keep some kind of "premier membership" or other method of extracting additional funds.
Anyway, here is additional discussion which I have not read yet.

Transaction fees are small now because the transaction volume of bitcoin is minuscule. Once bitcoin takes off, the total transaction fees should make up for the reductions of the blockchain reward. Fees may shrink, but the total fees will increase because the total number of transactions will increase.
So by design, transaction fees will scale by volume (up as volume increases) and by the value of each coin (down as value increases).

Not sure what you mean by "complete dataset". What are you trying to find out?
We know there are 21 million bitcoins because it is open source. The reward per block will halve until it reaches 1 satoshi (0.00000001BTC) then it will become zero. Halving occurs approx. every 4 years but isn't based on time, it is based on the number of blocks found.
Mining is finding a hash of the end of the last block that matches being under a certain value. The difficulty increasing means that the value it has to be under is significantly lower than previously. This is my understanding.

That's what everyone was saying after the crash in 2011. Network hashpower was huge after all the added GPUs and the crash didn't make it "profitable." Then there were people who made tons of coin at the beginning who didn't see any benefit later on. Those who still invested in GPUs and FPGAs at a loss later... well, it has recently made it worthwhile for them.
Point is, you don't know that. You could be right. On the other hand, you could be wrong.
The only thing you know for sure you are right about is that he won't make as much bitcoin as the earlier orders. As to if it will end up being worth it ordering now, no one knows.
This realization was the turning point that made me decide to order more, even though they are more of a risk than my early order.

It's hilarious that you don't look at the hashrate graphs and pay attention to the bitcoin community at large. If you had, you would realize that virtually all the hashrate is accounted for.
To hash undetected, BFL would not be making a profit because the hashrate wouldn't be near enough to be anything.

What is a HS/s? Do you mean MH/s or KH/s or maybe H/s?
@_date: 2013-07-18 16:51:43
That is 10mh/s/$ at current prices. Anything under 20mh/s/$ isn't even worth looking at. Also, there are no mining hardware companies besides ASICminer that offer such bad mh/s/$. 
Just warning that people should consider ROI before investing. It's pretty clear this company will make double the amount they spend on hardware from the sale of these so called "shares". Unless they start promising expansion, I can't see this being profitable for the shareholders.

ASICs, CPU miners, GPU miners, FPGAs etc. all do a double SHA256 hash. If we change that, we are changing the entire proof of work of Bitcoin meaning all miners would need to be re-written (and in the case of ASICs, redesigned and built). It's not "a bunch of complex math stuff" it's "a double SHA256 hash."
So mughat has the right idea but OREWebfoots doesn't know what an ASIC is. I have a feeling most people don't understand how big a deal and how difficult it would be to change the mining algorithm.
I'm going to have to disagree with jevon about scrypt ASICs. Looking at the selling price of current SHA256d ASICs, I don't see how adding memory would be a big deal with regards to cost vs profit from sales (assuming Litecoin becomes popular enough for it to be worthwhile).

**But if we switched to scrypt/gpu mining then the following would be the case:**


AMD will all be mining in the future with more hardware then they sell, which means 50% of the network will always be in the hands of the rich who buy from AMD. like it or not, litcoin is centralized by historian1111's definition.
Seriously though, what did you expect from a free market? Right now a bunch of companies are starting to emerge and compete in this technology field. Also, companies are emerging who mine. And sometimes, companies do both. Depends on their business model and what makes sense.
They are selling hardware exclusively to bitcoin miners so of course their prices will be on the edge of ROI by the estimates that will get the most revenue. As more players come out, prices will drop. But really, what is going to happen is the market will come to an equilibrium of just barely not profitable in most cases and just barely profitable if you really hunt for good prices because if companies drop prices due to competition and less demand, more miners will buy and the network will grow until ROI is again at equilibrium. The only time you will make a huge "instant satisfaction" profit is if you get lucky with your investment. For example, if you bought ASICminer shares, bought Avalon batch 1 or bought an early BFL in USD.
But that was a bit off topic since it really doesn't relate that much to centralization. What centralization is, is when a single entity or multiple entities that aren't really competing have control of bitcoin mining. But let's use your broader definition. You are trying to say it would still be considered centralized if only a few player control the market. But this isn't quite right. Your definition of centralized only occurs if a single entity or multiple non-competing entities control the market. It has nothing to do with allowing people with no available capital to get a free ride. Bitcoin mining will never centralize by your definition because even entrepreneurs with little capital (relatively speaking, say 200-800K USD) can enter this market. Those on the higher end can enter later on because they can invest in the latest technology.
By contrast, you try to enter the CPU market, you will fail. The design is much more complex and Intel, AMD, ARM etc, have all spent decades optimizing their design. Bitcoin mining hardware is relatively simple. The inital design, if designed properly, cannot be optimized to a large degree.
Hang on, I seem to have misread your post. I will keep the above, however, since I think you might have been confused about what you are talking about. I don't believe you meant to say "foundries" but below I will assume you did.
Centralized by the foundries? Really? In that case, Bitcoin has been centralized since it's inception by GlobalFoundries, TSMC and Intel. And by your definition, I guess torrents are all centralized too by the same players.
Point is, I disagree. Also, I think I rambled a bit much because I am tired.

From reading your post, I would say yes, purchase the block erupter and retire your 550ti in a few weeks, once you've had your fun with it. I would also encourage you to purchase a raspberry pi and learn more about linux and the whole Bitcoin/ Bitcoin Mining ecosystem. I think you would find it all very interesting.
The erupter would provide you will a relatively fast miner with practically zero electric cost. This would allow you to keep mining for fun while learning about Bitcoin ASIC devices. It is not a device fast enough to make a full return on your purchase.
I purchased several myself once they dropped enough to be affordable as a simple personal interest item (hint: WTCR has the best prices in Canada, at least, and they pass on the deals they get from their return purchases to return customers).
And if you ever decide you want to go deeper down the mining rabbit hole by finding proper investments that can make a return and are willing to take risk, you will already have a lot of experience with the whole thing.
ASICminer delivers fast and reliably, which is why their prices are so high. If you decide to go down the rabbit hole and invest more heavily, you will have to pay close attention to the market, ASIC prices and not trust all companies as well as playing within your comfort zone; standard invest only what you can afford to lose.
As for pool, I haven't left p2pool for a while because I can't find a pool I like. I used to be with BTCGuild for the longest time until their PPS rate got way too high. Eligius for a while but then they started having horrendous luck. So I set up my own P2Pool node, which is a fun task if you are into technology.
As fun as P2Pool is, I've calculated at their current p2pool difficulty, it is useless to mine there below 2GH/s.

Short rebuttal because I am bored. It will probably be as well thought out as his article:
1. If the government wanted to "crack down" on Bitcoin as much as he thinks they do, Bitcoin would already be illegal. At this point, there are now new businesses growing that make it more difficult to make illegal than when it was in its infancy.
2. What is easy to shut down? Certainly not Bitcoin as it cannot be shut down as much as people networking cannot be shut down. I thought he might go into something about businesses etc but instead he really does seem to think Bitcoin itself can be shut down easily.
3. Businesses have popped up to easily work around this. Eventually, the major fluctuations should stop.
4. Suffice it to say, this argument is debatable.
5. This is actually a misunderstanding on his part. This argument would be true if all the coins were in circulation now. They aren't. Bitcoin is deflationary but not in the way this man portrays. New currency is created at the approximate rate of 25 bitcoins per 10 minutes or 3600BTC/day. Put that in dollar value and that is $468,000 per day. So no, a currency does not require inflation, it requires new issuance. Bitcoin has this. It also has a future solution to replace new issuance with re-issuance once the 21M cap is reached. Bitcoin is currently a bit of a mess because it is small, which should even out over time. This also ties back to the dollar value.
6. Nope. People don't care about Bitcoin. But you know what people *do* care about? The advantages of Bitcoin. These advantages are certainly not going to come to the masses in the form of direct and purposeful adoption. They will come like fire from the businesses the promote them and built them into their own services. Take bitpay, for example.
7. It's not. It's less complex than Linux but point taken. However, again, I do not see mass adoption in the form of the current wallets. Most will probably be some form of online services. People don't like to be responsible for the loss or protection of their own money.
8. Thing is, to compete, these processors and these additional services he is talking about would *have* to charge less than credit card companies in order to compete. Otherwise, we are looking at no business due to no merchant adoption. Speaking of competing though, it looks to me like Bitcoin would be easier to enter and compete as a processor, driving down said fees on average.
9. So is my bank. So is how I pay via credit card at the restaurant. This really is a moot point. If the internet was unavailable to everyone in the world, there would certainly be more things to worry about than paying my bill with Bitcoin. If you are talking about an isolated outage, then who cares?
10. Yes. Yes I would. Even though I am not a coder who has scrawled the source code, I trust the "majority" and the people who have read the code. I am at the point where I understand how Bitcoin works quite well and I am astounded at how amazing the system is at a technical level. What is being hacked are idiots who don't think they should hire security analysts or professionals to assess the security of the systems they use to process Bitcoin.
"Politicians are on a furious trajectory to kill Bitcoin."
First I heard of this.
"Several established enterprises (likely in financial services or Silicon Valley) must first figure out how to make lots of money from Bitcoin."
Alternately, some enterprises must be established because they can make lots of money from Bitcoin. Oops, this already happened and is the reason the Bitcoin Foundation exists. Because they want to protect their interests.
"US citizens will not fight this battle. So it’ll have to be businesses, a.k.a. donors."
I suppose what is happening right now depends on your point of view. But I believe what he is referring to *is* happening right now. Does this guy live under a rock?
"Without powerful influencers driving adoption, Bitcoin is destined to die alone, eaten by cats."
I suppose powerful is a relative term but he really sounds like he is living in 2011.
And then he just goes on about his own ideas which clearly would have already started happening at Bitcoin's currently maturity level if it were appropriate for the current level. It's not like he's the only one who thinks these things up.
"Bitcoining of the US Dollar and the death of cash."
Where did this come from? I honestly never see this happening nor do I see it as a logical progression of Bitcoin this century.

1. **GPU mining hardware:**
Expected hashrate: 1-1.2GH/s for ~$1000 at about 1KW+
* Increased hashrate in the network over time will make coins earned vs electricity cost extremely low very quickly
* Learning curve steep if not computer literate
* high electricity usage
* Easy to find parts - used or new
* Get up and running quickly
* better possible resale value to general public
Parts list (for ~1000$ total:
* 1x AMD motherboard with 3x PCI-e 16x (or 8x) slots
* 1x least expensive AMD processor you can find or an APU for slightly higher hashrate
* 2x radeon 7970s, 7950s, 5970s or 3x 7870s, 5870s, 5850s, or 5830s. Depending on what you can find used.
* a 1000W+ corsair or high quality power supply
* a case or wooden board to put the stuff in/on
* cheap hard drive for OS (linux or windows)
2. **FPGA miners:**
Expected hashrate: 0.8GH/s for ~$1100 at about 50W
* Increased hashrate in the network over time will make coins earned seem small vs the space they take up and eventually the electricity.
* upfront cost
* hard to find parts new or used
* no longer sold new that I can find
* better than GPUs efficiency-, noise- and space-wise
Parts list (for ~1000$ total:
* 1x ZTEX USB-FPGA Module 1.15y or 2x X6500 FPGA Miner or 1x ModMiner Quad or 3x Icarus
3. **SHA256 hashing ASIC miners**
Expected hashrate: 60GH/s for ~$1200 at 620W or 60W
* wait times. BFL has yet to ship and has a wait list. Avalon is shipping extremely slowly
* price/GH/s
* power/GH/s
Parts list (for ~1200$ total:
* 1x BFL single or 1x Avalon unit
Make your own analysis. Know that the network difficulty will increase to over 100 million by end of year. This is based on my estimation of 800GH/s total by end of year if no new ASIC players enter the market by then. Right now you need 8.69GH/s to make 1BTC/day. At difficulty 111.76 million, you will need 222.22GH/s to make 1BTC/day.

You decide. You are the one taking the risks. I chose to take the risks, myself.
Now, about the video. The technical points he discusses are correct from my (painful - I hate artificial voices for delivery of information) listen through of it. They are what every miner knows and what every miner should have already taken into account a long time ago. For example, I have a google docs spreadsheet I use that has 7 or so sheets used to model my projections of income based on different scenarios. The continually increasing total hashpower is what protects the integrity of the network by making it always larger than is worthwhile or possible for a single entity to try to take control of mining. I believe that if bitcoin is successful, market forces will ensure miners find the more efficient mining hardware on the market at any given time to be profitable. And because bitcoin ASICs are simple, there are little to no hardware optimizations that can improve efficiency besides material and process technologies (Unlike the large and complex CPU designs). (eg look at Avalon 110nm vs BFL 65nm and we can see efficiency increases will start to become minimal once the latest processes are adopted). Avalon is 107MH/J and BFL is looking at (optimally) 170MH/J. (note also that the Avalon measurement, at least, is from the wall... I can't get chip measurements, obviously, but this still illustrates my point)
Currently, I am looking at November for delivery of an order ordered last month. By then I expect 0.15BTC/day, optimistically. This is easier to model than early orders because by the time I get that order, most of the hashing power that has been announced to be added to the network should have been already added. Past that, we can expect limited manufacturers releasing their own Avalon chip based miners and some additional resale from ASICminer but it will be at a slower rate. And of course a slower increase from BFL. I expect between 800 and 1000 GH/s by the end of the year and this of course will slowly increase.
So using your own research and calculations, you need to determine if it is worthwhile for you or not. And I advise you to definitely treat it as a high-risk investment because of factors like some previously unknown 28nm ASIC manufacturer or a long-term bitcoin price drop, etc.
If you are simply interested in mining and want to get into the mining as a hobby, order one or two 5GH/s miners and don't expect any return. And if you do get a return then treat it as a bonus.

Hm. so according to OP, it would take 9.4 minutes to find a share, assuming somehow, you happened to hash a valid share (according to the pool difficulty) every single time.
The problem is at this speed, the probability of even finding a valid diff 1 share for the pool is extremely low. There would never be enough consistency to say there would be an hourly revenue. Probability suggests you wouldn't even be able to submit something valid and therefore would never get a payout.
Even worse is if it took you longer to do the math. If a block is found before you finish your calculations, you would have to abandon your current calculations and start all over again.
Furthermore, we are not taking into account typing up the packet to broadcast to the network by hand and sending it. Or will we be using IP over carrier pigeon?

ASIC stands for Application Specific Integrated Circuit. In this case, several companies have designed, build and are starting to sell their ASICs that they have designed in hardware to do SHA256 hashing, which is what is used for Bitcoin mining.
CPUs and GPUs are multi-purpose devices so the mining has to be programmed in software.
FPGAs are reprogrammable hardware. They are much more efficent.
ASICs are built in hardware to just mine. BFL's chips can each do 1 hash, per Hz, per unit. Each chip contains 16 units and should be clocked close to 500MHz. Each board will have 8 chips. You do the math.
So, no, there is no contest. The ASIC mining devices will outperform everything currently on the market. The problem is that it will be a while before you can get one if you order now... several months, minimum. There is backlog. The other two devices are available now. I grabbed a 5830 off a guy early last year. More than paid itself off by now. But if you were to get it now, the margin would be thinner.
As time goes by, the difficulty will increase. If you do not know what the difficulty is or are not aware of the two week target period, I recommend you do a lot more research before even considering mining.

What?! Bitcoin's price is driven by supply and demand? No way!
@_date: 2013-03-10 16:46:51
1. Yes. Do it now. Bitcoin will never be this easy to mine with a GPU again. Just don't sell them for dollars.
2. Yes, they would be nice. But they seem hard to come by these days. I tried looking into them but couldn't find many. And even those were offered at prices not worth it for Bitcoin mining.
3. No. I did see an ad on kijiji once for one for $100. Did some research and found someone had programmed one and gotten less than 5MH/s out of it. Not worth it.
4. Last I checked was a couple weeks ago. Bitcoin mining vs Litecoin then selling for Bitcoin: profitability seemed about the same. But there are tons of calculators out there (most are at litecoin pool websites) that you can use to check which is more profitable at a given time.
I personally just stick with Bitcoins because it is not worth my time to figure the profitability out. And unless there are some big news items about people making tons off Litcoin mining, I will not switch. I have my 100LTC locked up for the "just in case" they are ever worth even 1/10th of a BTC.
My advice is to mine now with whatever you have. 8 months ago I was tossing Bitcoins around like they were $2 coins. Now they are nearing $50. Who knows what will happen? All I know is that if the system is valued, it will, well, get more value.

That's $10 more than you can get them at WTCR *after* shipping (batch of 10). (at current CAD, EU and BTC conversions)
Even with the WTCR price, My calculations indicate no more than an optimistic return of 50% what you paid after one year.
So to answer your questions, though:
1. ASICminer is the oldest ASIC mining device manufacturer. They have been reliably delivering units with (as far as I can see) no issues or complaints from customers.
2. Due to the above, no profits. Due to (1.), their prices are so high, you will not make your money back.
3. It is an AMAZING starter device. I have 10 on order. It looks to be similar to the larger miners out there that run hundreds to thousands of dollars and require a host machine. But it plugs into the USB and draws no more power than USB spec. So, it is a low power device that will allow you to test out mining software and host setups, pool setups etc. It will give an introduction to modern mining. I will be using them to confirm my raspberry pi hosts before I get my larger miners.

This is an interesting piece but I think you are missing a key point. Bitcoin is a base, not a solution for everything. Services are being built and will continue to be built on top of Bitcoin. Honestly, in the world some people propose where bitcoin is the only currency, I honestly do not see many people directly owning Bitcoins. I think what you are saying is like complaining that TCP packets are difficult to read. Who reads TCP packets? I use a Web browser. Or messenger app. Or all of the services build upon the stack. And these services have gotten way better over the past 20 years.

The problem with P2Pool is that you need a relatively large individual hashrate in order to get a payout every time p2pool finds a block (find a share on average at least every few hours). At the moment, 30GH/s is starting to become inconsistent. if you have a block eruptor, it is unlikely you will ever find a share. 
We need more PPS pools built on top of P2Pool in order to support smaller miners by combining their hashrate to a single address.

**Urgent Warning on Gold:**
**Promoters Pushing It Like a Penny Stock**
Not long ago, we gave you the inside skinny on Gold -- both its strengths and weaknesses. However, the deluge of promotional emails and ads we've witnessed in the past few weeks has compelled us to revisit the issue.
We're frankly concerned people could get hurt financially.
Free-market analyst Mokahless labeled the precious metal a "chain letter" that has even less backing than the U.S. dollar.
At least the dollar has a government behind it that can raise taxes to shore it up, Mokahless noted. A far cry from something like Bitcoin, Gold has no efficient way to be used as currency in our modern economy and relies purely on persuading others it is a safe haven from inflation.
Heavy market manipulation and creation of Gold "investments" without any real Gold behind the deed has helped fuel a close to 500% increase in the "value" of Gold in the past two decades. The drop could be just as dramatic.
The situation reminds us of those penny stocks you occasionally see promoted. Yes, adept speculators can jump in, get out, and make some real money. But many will lose most or all of their investment -- depending on which particular month they acted on the "hot tip"
If you are considering putting one thin dime into Gold, please get the facts first. *Caveat Emptor*!


@_date: 2013-04-17 14:37:25
Because they don't want to take profits and risk in bitcoin? You are regulated in USD, you pay taxes in USD, all your debts are in USD. Why would you risk mining bitcoins yourself? This is a business, not a gambling company. The purchasers of the ASICs are the gamblers.
The current machines for pre-order by BFL are bringing in more money than if they were to mine by themselves. Not to mention that if they were to mine, and take 75% of the network, that would end all confidence in bitcoin and destroy their profits by destroying the value of bitcoin.
The designed their business for a "sure thing." The sales of their units and profit in USD.
Let's take a look at ASICminer, who decided *from the beginning* to mine themselves. They took a **much** larger risk. For them, it did pay off. But at the same time, because of the exchange rate now, people are willing to pay a lot for the miners that they intend to start selling. 30+BTC/10GH/s is the current bid.

Miners are rewarded on average once every 10 minutes when a valid block is found. In this instance, only one miner finds the valid block and therefore the reward. The reward is currently 25BTC. Your first assumption is correct.
So yes, you could get lucky but the chances are so small that it isn't worth it. Therefore, people mine in "pools" where they pool their resources and if a block is found, the 25BTC is shared proportionally by the work done between all the miners in the pool.
So, if a miner is in a pool, they are guaranteed to get bitcoins. If they are mining alone, it is extremely unlikely they will find 25 bitcoins.
Now, as for your first question:
There is a hard limit of 21 million bitcoins (each divisible up to 8 decimal places)
Having them not all in circulation and introducing them bit by bit provides an incentive for miners to verify transactions. It also solves the problem of "If the currency is decentralized, who gets the money in the beginning?" Printing all the money then giving it to one person or splitting it randomly to everyone defeats the purpose of the decentralized currency.

Based on your questions, it seems you do not understand how Bitcoin mining works and the risks/ rewards. So my best advice to you is to start mining now with whatever you have, perhaps invest up to $100-400 additionally, depending on your financial situation.
Use that as an opportunity to experience mining first hand and learn everything you need to know through experience and asking specific questions online as you go. Through necessity of understanding what you are doing, you will find yourself doing a lot of research into the technicalities.
After this, you will have a better perspective and you will be able to invest accordingly.

Every business is a risk. But gambling on the price of bitcoin is even riskier. Where do you think ASICminer would be if Bitcoin had stayed at $10? What if it went to $2?
They have definitely lost customers over this; the reason they recently announced sales of chips alone. Because they have more chips than orders by a long shot [last part is speculation on my part].
FYI, it was an announcement, not an actual release and like everything else BFL has done, it was a poor choice to announce it at this point in time.


Not everybody has to. There is such a thing as the internet where people are everywhere. Someone once freaked because he saw some hashrate increase from BFL area but it turned out to be a nearby pool. Sure, they could mine some on the real network but nowhere near enough to be profitable or worthwhile.
And it's not really math; it's just organizing publicly available information. Google spreadsheets does the adding of what you have accounted for. ASICminer is open about their share. The exact number of Avalon units shipped is available. The network was ~30TH/s before ASICs and a few more GPU miners have joined in the media rush. Try it sometime. Do your own analysis.

It is true that their official policy states no refunds but last I checked they were honouring refunds nonetheless.

@_date: 2013-12-14 22:26:19
They wouldn't. They would mine the alt coin. They are doing this now with litecoin as if you have a GPU, it is more profitable to mine litecoins and trade for bitcoins than to mine bitcoins with the GPU.
It's also not "just" transaction fees. The reward drops every ~4 years. The supply is controlled. It's like asking, why would someone mine bitcoin when they can mine peercoin instead because each block reward is 137.89 for peercoin and 25 for bitcoin.
The transaction fees will be set by the market, which will also indirectly set the total hashrate of miners. The system will equalize itself to be just barely profitable for miners.

This is the interesting thing. It is a dividend paying investment, so this is normally not how you should think.

Spend $10K on bitcoins and $10K on mining equipment. The key to mining equipment is finding the right opportunities and jumping on them. Unfortunately, there are no good opportunities at the moment.
**If you do not want to take mining seriously, I recommend just buying bitcoins**. What I mean by taking mining seriously, as well as some advice:
*keep track of the difficulty and future predictions. For example, I have a 3-sheet google spreadsheet calculator I use to fetch current variables and make calculations.  My calculations are currently based on an estimates average of 30% diff increase per target period. This could change. I have set it up to get at a glance information including recommended current prices to purchase mining equipment including up to a 4 month delivery delay. Currently there is nothing worthwhile. Do not estimate more than 6 months for a return. If you can't make your money back in 6 months, the miner investment is too risky. And remember no matter how good your calculations are, things could dramatically change.
*keep track of the ASIC market. Be on top of all new players and news. You need to set the right time to jump on a good deal as soon as they appear valid enough for your risk/reward ratio.
*uptime is important. Not only of your miners but of your pools. You must maintain your equipment, power and internet connection.
*mining is a job. a real job can get in the way of mining, though not entirely impede it. If you work a 9-5 job and have a family, you probably don't want to take the time to be a competitive miner unless you have someone else keeping track of the ASIC market and maintaining your equipment etc, for you. Busy at work and home has power outage and your machines don't properly reboot? 8 hours lost. At a family event for the day and your miners unexpectedly go down? Now you are spending it glued to your phone remoting in and trying to figure out what went wrong.
*you don't want to put all your eggs in one basket. Having only one unit doing 500GH/s can be scary if it goes down.
*the big problem with the market at the moment is that all the good deals are by untrustworthy companies accepting bitcoins and bankwire only with no consumer protection. You choose mining, you will not be spending all $10K at once. You will be waiting for opportunities and diversifying.
**If you are not willing to become a serious miner, you can purchase some equipment and have it sit. But you introduce more risk and less reward because your lack of technical knowledge will increase your troubleshooting periods and your lack of time to deal with the issues will increase your downtime. Plus your lack of time to watch the ASIC market will mean you will purchase overpriced equipment and have even less chance of making your money back.**

once you have it, it doesn't matter how much you spent on it as long as you are profiting vs electricity. because that extra goes to pay off the miner. essentially, it's better to be in the hole $500 after mining for months than to be $1000 in the hole because you didn't mine at all. 
so once you have it, it isn't a waste of electricity unless what you make is less than what you mine.

You are failing to realize the difference between Bitcoin in its infancy and the Bitcoin of the future. I personally don't think Bitcoin could become so-called "world's currency." However, it has huge potential.
What you are failing to realize is that Bitcoin is a base for value. Paypal and credit cards are SERVICES build upon the dollar. They are not the dollar. Similar services will surface and are surfacing for the Bitcoin infrastructure.
In a supposed future where Bitcoin is the "world's currency" I would be paying with some kind of service that provides me with buyer protection, just like a credit card or paypal. I would not be paying with straight Bitcoin for large purchases as that would be the equivalent of mailing cash in an envelope to pay for something online (though obviously faster).

This is already done in some clients at the wallet level. No need to change the Bitcoin code.
No need for general users to have the full blockchain. This has been discussed a lot.

Buying ASICs would not work for this. They would not be able to get enough.
Developing ASICs themselves would be the only way. They would need to develop them, and deploy them. By this time, the network would be over 800TH/s. So they would need enough ASICs to satisfy ~1PH/s.
I do not know the cost of development so I will leave that to other posters. Once they are developed, costs would be less to produce en masse.
Then there is the question of what the hell they would do with that hashing power with regards to the attack. How would they attack with over 50%? I personally can't think of anything that would significantly disrupt the blockchain.
I find it far more likely that the attacks would be on the exchanges. Oh hey, wait a minute. What was that I heard about MTgox and that Brazilian exchange lately?
Honestly though, the best attack would be to devalue Bitcoin itself. Hitler-media style.
Also, realistically, because finding blocks is random, they should probably aim for more around 80% to be reliable with regard to the attack. If I had that much hashing power and control, I wouldn't attack the blockchain. I would flood the exchanges with my sell orders.
**the above was a quick brainstorming from me and not researched or thought about too much**

This is hilarious. Amir is his usual anarchist left-winging anti-government nutbar who just wants to incite people to argue with confrontative statements. And he puts words in their mouths and starts arguing against things they didn't even say.
Then Daniel restates everything he says in a logical, succinct way people can understand and adds to it. Heck, he even gave an extremely good answer to Ed's confrontative question about usage percent.
And Ed clearly hasn't read the whitepaper he keeps referencing.
I think this discussion would actually be extremely interesting without Amir. He tends to go off topic.

Money is the main driver for the bulk of miners. I mean, we *are* in the business of issuing currency to ourselves by processing transactions for a unique financial system.
This doesn't necessarily equate to greed nor does it stop the community from having great people.
To quote wikipedia, "Greed is the inordinate desire to possess wealth, goods, or objects of abstract value with the intention to keep it for one's self, far beyond the dictates of basic survival and comfort. It is applied to a markedly high desire for and pursuit of wealth, status, and power."
By this definition, I think greedy people in the community will be prone to entering and exiting it rather quickly, mainly due to personality and what will happen when they understand Bitcoin better.

Your CPU should be getting a much higher hash rate than 0.22MH/s. A single core of my Phenom II x6 gets 2-3MH/s.
That said, these hash rates aren't even worth it anymore. If you get a proper CPU miner and get your total hash rate for the next week to 5MH/s average (you could get a bit faster hash rate but I am accounting for downtime), you will get 0.0005BTC in a week. I don't know of a pool that will pay out such a low amount except eligius and p2pool. I believe the default transaction fee is something like 0.0001BTC.
I haven't heard KH/s used in relation to Bitcoin mining since 2010 or early 2011 maybe. Very soon you won't be hearing MH/s used in relation to Bitcoin mining anymore.

"the author of the windows file copy dialog tries to gauge the bitcoin price"
@_date: 2013-03-10 16:34:34
My estimate assumes you get yours in June. It could come much later but BFL claims their second batch will be shipped not long after the first.
I assume the hashrate will be 200-300 by then. And 800-1000 by end of year. Let's assume an optimistic 200 and 800. I am also assuming linear network increase. 14 days is one target period; a period where BTC earnings are static until the next retarget.
So the first 14 days you own it in June (200GH/s), you will earn ~1.13BTC
In the last 14 days in Dec. (800GH/s) you will earn ~0.28BTC
Both for the entire two weeks.
So at a glance, this could be something like 6BTC or more to end of year, optimistically. Currently, this is valued at 284USD. So in that case, this would be the winner, unless electricity for you is like $5/KWh
If any of the following happens, it is not the winner:
-Another vendor introduces ASICs in volume
-BTC price drops and doesn't recover
-BFL delivers yours later than expected
-Anything else affects my hashrate projections
So this is a risk. Only you can decide if it is worth it.
Personally, I would get the miner. But I also enjoy mining...
Longer term is much harder to predict but really long term, you will always earn a little tiny bit each period. I think eventually you will get more than 4 Bitcoins, even in a bad situation.

A blockchain.info wallet is the easiest to set up. The disadvantage is that you must trust them. Don't forget to back up your wallet.
I've been using multibit recently and really enjoy the interface. It is a download and install and requires no trust in an online service. Don't forget to back up your wallet.
I would not recommend a new person use Bitcoin-QT.

Moore's law states that transistor density doubles every 2 years. It has nothing directly to do with performance. It has *zero* to do with core count, frequency, FLOPs, MIPs, voltage.
If you take a quick glance at the evolution of video cards with regards to transistors/mm^2 over the past 10 years, you will see Moore's law is still holding true (video cards simply because the transistor count and die size information is more readily available).

An i3 only HAS two cores.
I clearly said my ONE core was faster than your two cores so no, that doesn't account for it. When I said "get a proper CPU miner", I was telling you that the miner program was the problem. Go on en.bitcoin.it and find the mining hardware comparison. In the CPU section, figure out what program those who have higher hashrates are using. I believe the standard CPUminer hasn't been updated in 3 years and is probably what you are using.
E: I believe you are talking about shares being accepted from a pool, not blocks. Which pool are you using?

I personally use a P2Pool node I set up myself. The only reason to go with a P2Pool node is to help further decentralize the network. But the payouts will be inconsistent. You could almost think of it as a combined solo-mining-pool combination. It has the disadvantage of being PPLNS but, you get to keep the fees as well as the block.
Anyway, everyone else has great recommendations. I used BTCGuild for a while but their fees became way too high. That's when I first switched to P2Pool. I moved to Eligius after my node started screwing up. Once I got my BFL unit though, Eligius starting having terrible luck. So I decided to set up my node again, this time in linux and everything is working nicely.
Look up the various payout methods (PPS, PPLNS etc.) on the bitcoin wiki. You can compare and decide which method is best for you.
The most important thing though is that you do not mine on just one pool. Have backups. I use CGMiner and it is set to failover to eligius if my p2pool node dies. If eligius fails, it will failover to BTCGuild. This is important to reduce your downtime.
