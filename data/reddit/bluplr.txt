They were ddosed today.
Money easily solves them but they still need time. There engine simply isn't good enough and I don't think a quick fix will do it. They would need to dramatically overhaul their infrastructure to handle the traffic over the last few days, and that takes more than 3 days.

High frequency traders

Yesterday was caused by HFT, but they were under ddos today and have been regularly over the last few weeks 
But ya that whole "success" thing was a slap in the face, terrible pr.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:21:59
I hear a lot of hate for mtgox, but I seriously doubt any other exchange could have handled the ddos and the new accounts any better. If it were another exchange, the same thing would've happened, albeit probably without the snobby attitude.

He implied he had no bitcoins a month ago and bought some 3 days ago, which will allow him to buy infinitely more with bitcoins than he could a month ago
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:56:44
You said "known". If the price going up was "known" then everyone would've invested everything they had in bitcoin. But it wasn't known, nobody could've predicted it with certainty, yet you expect mtgox to have invested huge amounts of their own money in expanding their services to handle something that was not just unknown, but incredibly unlikely to happen.
And real mature

Putting in a minimum trade amount wouldn't make them any less money. Limiting the number of transactions per minute is essentially what's going on with the trade lag. Limiting the number of transactions would merely add to this lag, as opposed to processing as many as it can handle.
@_date: 2013-04-20 12:33:58
It hadn't had one for the past [2 weeks]( something so fundemental for a service like this and incredibly easy to implement. I realise certs cost a couple of hundred dollars, but self signed is better than nothing when I'm connecting on a public wifi or over tor.
Right now I'd find it hard to trust icbit with my email address, let alone my coins.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:26:02
Ha you could be right, it is worth keeping in mind however that most of the major exchanges have complained about ddos's over the last number of weeks. Bitfloor is under attack right now.
@_date: 2013-04-11 11:01:29
That's absurd. There were admins on irc and people have phones, for something this serious I think they could get out of bed to prevent the loss of millions.

It was intended as a joke 
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:08:35
The HFT people would have still crashed it, imo.
During yesterdays crash it wasn't just mtgox that was down, it was almost all the exchanges.
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:31:01
I have a verified account there, can deposit money without a fee, and it works for general transactions. Also largest company with the best infrastructure.
Would I like to go to another? Hell yeah, show me a well backed company with a good infrastructure and a professional face and I'm there. There's a lot of them on the way, but just not here yet.
@_date: 2013-04-20 18:01:23
Well he had neither. But to address your point, if they use a self signed certificate you cannot be sure you are being attacked man in the middle attack.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:26:09
I don't think anyone could've handled it. It's not ideal, but gox has the best infrastructure right now, and I highly suspect all the other exchanges would've crumpled under the same pressure.
I would love to be told I'm wrong though and move to another exchange that was somehow immune from ddos and massive trade spikes.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:38:08


OH PLEASE. Bitcoin has gone up by 1000% in the last 3 months, going up by 50% every couple of days. The amount of trading has gone up by even more than that. Nobody could've predicted with reasonable certainty.
Mtgox created a service that was sufficient for the amount of traffic that they were receiving. It is absurd to expect them to invest incredibly large amounts of money and staff in developing a service to handle 100x the trade load, on the off chance that bitcoin might suddenly take off to the order of doubling every few weeks. 
So of course they didn't have the infrastructure in place, neither did any other exchange, and neither did you. Mtgox may have made some bad decisions such as not stopping the trade engine and have a terrible pr presence, but all this hate against mtgox for not catering for an extremely unlikely and unpredictable situation is completely unfair.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:48:30


Mtgox couldn't predict the future. Tell me, if you were so sure, did you remortgage your house and invest in bitcoin? You seem to think it's reasonable for mtgox to invest huge amounts of money in an uncertainty? That they should have *known* beyond doubt that the biggest bubble in history would happen. It is an uncertainty, it is a risk. If everyone knew it as you say, everyone here would be millionaires.
@_date: 2013-04-20 15:30:05
It did just change now, and you're absolutely right.
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:52:37
There are dozens of different ways of implementing HFT, yours is one. But with such an immature marketplace, I was taking HFT in its literal form, very high frequency trading. Not microsecond scale, or trying to manipulate the price difference between exchanges, but buying and selling very low amounts at a very high frequency. If you look at the orders that went through before and during the crash, these trades should be plain to see.
And HFT could lead to a dos, and was likely a major cause of lag on the trading engine.
But hey I'm not expert or even close, if you'd prefer take my comment to mean the large amounts of trading volume would've crashed the other exchanges too, and did.

That the fbi are running the site. There's not that much to understand.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:33:13


Yes, obviously. The price has gone up 1000% over the past few months, the infrastructure hasn't had a chance to catch up.


Because it takes money. Exchanges couldn't predict such a massive price and trade increase, it's unfair to expect them to plan for 100 times the amount of trade to suddenly happen over 2 months. Bicoin isn't backed by a government, there is no centralised body, if you want the infrastructure in place, you put it there. You have no right to complain about the inaction of others.

I'm a 21 year old 3rd year computer science student. I've always been interested in forex trading, spent a few years when I was younger writing bots and indicators for metatrader 4. I've wanted to get into investment banking for a long time, preferably working on hft, and will be doing an internship for a large investment bank this summer in their research division.
So I guess my question is, how could I direct my career path towards hft and quant?
@_date: 2013-04-12 09:25:38
Mtgox use prolexic, mtgox are regularly down due to ddos attacks.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:10:35
I didn't downvote you. I think bitcoins popularity caused this, and you could argue it was inevitable with the value of the currency going up much faster than the infrastructure could handle.

I really don't know. I doubt it would be as severe as the fork, perhaps more digits could be written to the ledger and old clients could simply ignore them. I would love to know the answer though.

icbit doesn't use ssl for its user login, yet advertises "Two factor authentication, secure TLS transmission, encryption, salted hashing, API access tokens."
There's no excuse for no ssl.
@_date: 2013-04-13 13:29:55
I'm not certain, but it might be possible the same way fixing the fork was possible 
If the public rejects the change and doesn't update their client, or in that case if the miners chose to not change their client, the the protocols would fork. It's not a problem if everyone agrees with the design change, and it's not powerful enough that they can change on a whim.
But I'm really not certain.

We did not need to be verified for bank transfer to mtgox.
@_date: 2013-04-13 11:50:34
Oh really? I verified my account so I could make SEPA transfers, how slow are you talking?
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:19:09
Well there aren't right now, but you're right, if we even had one professional and well backed bitcoin exchange ddosing wouldn't be a problem.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:28:28
They had years, and for years their services were sufficient. It takes a lot of time and money to build an infrastructure that can handle the trade volume that has happened over the last few weeks, and it's completely unfair to blame mtgox for not being prepared for a 1000% increase in the value of bitcoin over 3 months, something practically unheard of.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:25:45
Then you can buy infinitely more than you could last month
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:57:31
There's a very good chance the alternatives would also get ddosed for same reason mtgox are now

Bitcoin has no desire, bitcoin is a protocol. The community that believes in bitcoin has a desire, and that community includes yourself as you previously mentioned.


It's hard to tell. We don't have an extremely professional and sectioned off stock exchange, we have one website publicly facing the internet which was not built to handle the load it is currently facing. If mtgox were to announce decisively tomorrow that the lag and dossing problems were sorted for good, the price would absolutely soar, as that's the only thing stopping it. A lot of people know this, which is why the price is still high, people are waiting for mtgox to fix itself so the price can continue to go up. I believe it can happen, the new processing engine coming out on the 17th might fix things, but I also feel that if they idle for too long the confidence of investors will be (rightfully) lost. It's very hard to tell what will happen, mtgox need a crack team of people working non-stop on fixing this purely technical problem, but their silence and publicly low staff numbers doesn't inspire confidence that it will eventually be fixed.


Ah I didn't mean right like that, I meant as in it's unfair to complain about the inaction of others when nobody is responsible for the infrastructure of bitcoin, and to expect others to invest and risk their own money in servicing an unproven currency when you did not do it yourself.

He made several mistakes to point out how confusing it can be.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:02:11
They were as sufficient as any other exchange. Every other exchange would have crumpled under the same amount of traffic that they had. But yes, I do agree that the situation is ridiculous. What I was saying to the OP was that fixing it in 3 days would be extremely difficult, that to handle the load they were experiencing they would need a complete overhaul of their system.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:17:19
I would love to know how you think they could solve their problems in 3 days. Feel free to go into as much detail as possible, not forgetting ddos mitigation and testing.
