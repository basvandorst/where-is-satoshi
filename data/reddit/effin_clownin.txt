I guess Bithumb Cash. But I don't mind Bithumb Cash or the cryptocurrency for payback because both are useful.

Make sure your fully read up on it. Then the first thing you will need is a wallet and an exchange site you can trust. Some exchange sites have built-in wallets you can use.

The average ranges from .20% and up but Bithumb currently has the lowest at .15%.

Well on their site it says they have a one-time verfication number. I'm sure that's the extra step they have in place for  smartphone security. The code generated by the card that you yourself use on your phone would be compromised as soon as someone hacks your phone and the code would be useless since its a OTP.

For some odd reason I get the feeling organized crime in Korea decided to 'tax' bithumb users. That would make a great movie.

Reminds me of the little cars they gave out at Chevron a few years back.

Its retail will be $149 but those who reserve one will get it at 74.50 + 100 fxt. Not sure what they will value at when the product releases but still seems like a good deal. I was able to reserve with just my email so I'm not bound to any fees if i decide to change my mind.

I think its Fuze W' just like their Fuze X card.

Look at my post history and see if i mentioned anything about fuzeX. Yeah the fuzeX probably didn't live up to hype at least for now but I didn't buy that product for a reason. Now a cold wallet on the other hand, i thought it looked interesting and a friend invited me to a soft showing. Don't go calling ppl shill for no reason. I just used one pic from their site since they didn't have hte app ready at the time.

All these moms knowing a thing about cyrpto is amazing. I asked my mom about bitcoin and she asked if its a new video game.
