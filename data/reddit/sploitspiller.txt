If Gnome and Groupon are in two different businesses, then why is it a problem?

"why can't we use this card in credit mode by buying from bitstamp and instantly spend it on bitcoin accepting sites."
Great question! Has this been answered? (on a phone). Also, why MasterCard?

So the stereotype is true? British people are untrustworthy.

Stick a fork in it, that dirty cocksucker. My grandfather fought long and hard so citizens of the village of Benchwater could steal each other's mail and shoot at a single water buffalo that sometimes wanders into their backyards. They named him Terry, after "Tommy Santana", the crooked chief of police. He would sing and dance with the children and everyone loved him, until he started wandering into their backyards (the policeman) and so they shot him with an assault rifle-shaped chlorine pump.

I apologize if I missed this, but did the bitinstant people sell bitcoins purposefully to Silk Road customers to help them buy drugs or did they just sell bitcoins to anyone that wanted to buy them and not give a shit what they did with them?
Also, why is this worse than HSBC laundering money for drug cartels?

I've actually been looking for an answer to this in the thread but have not found it, so you can help. If gnome already has an active trademark, how will groupon also obtain a trademark? And what will donating Bitcoins do to stop that from happening?
@_date: 2014-07-04 20:50:56
That's the real issue here.

From what I recall, the recent news stated that Barclay was found to have been manipulating the price of gold for about the last ten years (sorry can't dig for a source at the moment). I believe they were fined a pathetic $20m (you know, for fucking everyone for a decade).

I thought the blockchain keeps track of every transaction. Would it not be incredibly simple to track the "hacker" as soon as they attempt to use the coins?

I just meant the majority, not literally everyone. For a while, it was all about getting the price to rise more and more. After it crashed from somewhere around $1000 to around $200-300, the conversation changed to where people wanted to see the price stabilize so that it would be more realistic for everyday use, instead of just a risky investment.

Is "agreeing" some new Reddit feature I was unaware of?

I don't think they get what a source is.
@_date: 2015-10-31 17:36:53
I haven't followed Bitcoin in a while, but when I was, everyone seemed to want the price to stabilize instead of continue rising. Is that no longer the case?
@_date: 2015-10-31 20:50:58
Me neither. I was referring to the media that was focused on bitcoin at the time, as well as various subreddits and social sites.

Could someone please refer me to an exchange that offers instant transactions when buying and selling?
I'm currently setting up an account with coinbase. It's the only one I could find that says they have instant transactions. How fast are they and how reliable?
I'm looking to test the bitcoin waters for short and long term investing, as well as having coins on hand to shop. All advice welcome.

I was actually about to argue that it would be a waste of time to convert to bitcoin to spend in the first place (which I understand is a common argument), but then I realized that, if you are a bitcoin investor, it would very much be in your best interest to continue spending bitcoin as well, keeping the market alive and growing.
@_date: 2013-10-28 00:20:36

I agree with both of you: free speech is good, jerking off in a circle is fun, and more unbiased/informative posts are needed.
