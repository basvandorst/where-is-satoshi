why dont you request an addit of coinbase, bitthumb, kraken. Tether and bitfinex have a history to working for transparency and trying to be open all these these other exchanges show ZERO statistics. Which exchanges where the ones that soared through 20K twice in december (Coinbase, bithumb) if anything is fishy is going on are in theses exchanges where you are not able to talk to anyone from their and they dont have a history of being open. Where are their stats no where to be found.

Why dont you ask the same thing about coinbase bithumb and all these other big exchanges? Have they even tried to be transparent? At least tether and bitfinxed are trying. What has coinbase and all this other exchanges done? Oh but no pressure on them right. The exchange that is actually trying to be open is the one that gets attacked that makes sense.

You don’t need to buy bitcoin you can work for it. You don’t vote st the ballot. You vote with your money and your time. If you believe in bitcoin and  a decentralized future. Then look for a boss that believes in it too. And give him your time in the form of work for bitcoin.

No one that knows how bitcoin actually works, can be tricked into believing that he was Satoshi, and Flibbr is not a newcomer.

Wow you are severely misinformed. You dont know that COinbase has margin? Oh wait but only open for certain institutional investors who are this people? Oh thats right no information? How are you so adamant in believe a company like coinbase is more solvent when they show users ZERO stats vs Tether and bitfinex that have a history of trying to be transparent. I mean what entity out there is willing to show the assest they own in an updated fashion? They could have just printed the tethers without anyone knowing without the transparency page on their site:
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:05:54
Where is the audit for the banks of coinbase and kraken? Where are their transperancy have you even had anyon them come into the community to talk? Bitfinex has, tether even has a transparency page i mean what company has this level of opens only bitfinex only tether.     what exchange soared through unprecedented prices in december COinbase what exchange, what exchange limits margin capabilities to institutional investor COinbase, what those that even mean who are this institutional that would like to be involved in bitcoin through margin lol.

Thank you for writing this I hope a lot of new people get to read this. Also people need to be not be discouraged about the price. If you want to get involved: rent your apartments for bitcoin, ask your interviewer if he pays employees in bitcoin; do you have any skills? Will you take bitcoin for those skills? Let the community know what you are willing to do for bitcoin. This is our future that we are creating. we don’t need any old hats to tell us how to live when they won’t even exist in our futures.

@_date: 2019-07-05 11:21:21
It’s about being truly decentralized. Compared to the other coins out there that have points of failure. Bitcoin is fast and cheap people just don’t want to keep up with the updates. There is no reason people shouldn’t be using segwit. specially exchanges. And those rumors are probably old or by people that don’t actually use the currency. My transactions are always cheap and always quick. Also I am surprised you didn’t get back in at 3500. That was close enough to your previous sell no.

Read as much as you can about why bitcoin is important or not, why was it created what’s the point of this global open source project. Then decide. Nothing is wrong with 90% investment or 10 %. You just need to believe in your decision and be unwavering. My input would be that every year this planet is becoming more and more electronic; more and more code based. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 04:59:53
I think it would be among the worse decisions you ever made. Just remember You vote with your Money not at the ballots. Why would you support a company like lambo? And Gucci and all these brands.

1. “Is there enough for everyone” 
lol uhmm bitcoin is divisible by 100million Satoshi there is definitely enough.
2. “Distribution” 
Satoshi left the 1 million bitcoin to secure the system. They won’t be moving ever.
3. “Adoption”
The way that bitcoin will really be spread is that early adopters need to finally realize that they need to begin projects and open companies to hire people and pay them with bitcoin. But for that to happen retail companies need to realize the advantages of selling their merch for bitcoin, so that people can begin to use it for everyday life.
@_date: 2018-05-30 14:40:05

Report this address to as many exchanges as you can.

You have seen the light. Welcome bro! This is definitely an experience and I can only imagine what the ancient Incas or Romans would say if they saw our world. They all couldn’t have imagine the world we live in and the future is going to be even more insane.
Edit: misspelling 
@_date: 2018-05-30 12:57:06
Yes exactly. Which is why the bitcoin old timers should have being the ones to make crypto ads and buy Facebook and google ads to promote Bitcoin. Instead they let everyone else abuse the crypto name aka bitconnect and other scams. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 16:34:03
Congratulations bro!!! 
@_date: 2018-05-10 01:42:02
Holly mackerel they are about to control the mining industry. Is there really no one else that would like to contribute. Don’t get lazy guys! 
@_date: 2018-05-02 15:30:45
@_date: 2018-05-30 13:34:30
I commend you for that I do the same. 
And yes of course anyone can do anything. I don’t use social media as much so I never really got to hear about bitconnect and all these other scams until the very end. 
I am just saying that it would have being ideal if people around the world were promoting the real decentralized coin from an advertising, social media, point of view which reaches millions vs word of mouth. Just so that they don’t loose money like many did or get into the wrong alts, which from imo is 90% of them. Also not everyone has a knack for computers. But I am just daydreaming of course. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 02:42:14
 yeah my bad idk why I said “all” I meant it’s important to show people how easy it is now when people still remember how their institutions betrayed them. 
@_date: 2018-05-07 17:53:24

Far from the truth. Bitcoin is like light, with two properties simultaneously, it’s a peer to peer system, that can act like a store of value. Right now the swings are violent. However in 5 years. The currency will be more stable to be both. Just remember all currencies fluctuated in value today peso dollar yen. Nothing some code can’t take of, to buy goods with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-05-07 04:55:03

If you pay the taxes govt doesn’t care won’t ask. The banks however will prob freeze it and give you a run around. Make sure to talk to a bank first and choose a bank that has not frozen peoples assets for crypto before. Maybe open a credit union.

You can find justice depending on how good the scammer was. If he liquidated the bitcoin at an exchange with his name attached he can tracked. If he is intelligent enough you probably won’t find him/her.

Yeah don’t put your money into lending platforms they are basically scams. Just hodl it’s always good to take your coins off exchanges to a personal wallet. But only if you are responsible enough to protect your keys.
 If you have any skills please be willing to accept bitcoin. A lot of projects need man power that accept bitcoin. 
And lastly,  be careful with alts they look good and taste bad.
@_date: 2019-06-29 09:03:02
Local businesses will actually be among the first that would seek to adopt this. Businesses are investments, and a  business owner will see bitcoin as an investment just as their own business was an investment when it was first started.

if you are in the usa i use coinbase. I never heard of that site above but do your research. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:43:07
next week for sure. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 06:06:19
use gdax bc the orders will be free...and yes coinbase is like a wallet but you dont own your keys. Keep your Long investments off exchanges in wallets such as breadwallet or hardware such as Nano Ledger or trezor etc. Keep short term investments that you constantly trade on gdax (this should be a small percentage).  Also watch Richard heart on YT he is very good with understanding whats going on in crypto and help me when i first started he has being on point since the begining. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 06:34:54


we tried telling people not to switch you need to follow developers that wont lie to you like charlie lee on twitter, Richard Heart and Boxmining on YT. etc. Ivan tech is good also. Altcoins are mostly to Pump and dump not to keep. or else just keep your coins in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-06-28 22:59:55
Hodl hodl and Localbitcoins (Localbitcoins now has kyc for certain transactions which sucks. Also hodl hodl is better but not available in the USA)
@_date: 2017-11-16 06:27:08
you can also just transfer the USD firest and then hold it until there is a dip...you can also send the fiat USD to gdax and buy it there without fees.

@_date: 2017-11-16 06:12:22
yes gdax and coinbase are the same and have the same limits etc. They will increase as time passes and you make more purchases. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 06:17:17
depends on where you live. If the USa Coinbase or bitcoin atms in big cities. If mexico you can join Bitso. etc. Where are you from?  and btw i have never heard of buybitcoinworldwide.com so be careful with any site people post research first.

10.5 k now soo...
@_date: 2019-12-27 01:06:11
This doesn’t make sense? If you had 47.5 of bitcoin then you should have that same amount regardless of time. The “value” of it might decrease or increase but the “amount” of bitcoin you have should be the same unless the institution that you bought from is doing something weird.
@_date: 2017-11-16 06:35:31
but why would you want to use bitcoin now? its value will increase you should wait until 4-5 years from now. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 06:11:23
he is basically saying if you keep your money in cash: today 20 dollars will get you a nice dinner and ten years you will only be able to buy a bottle of water. While in bitcoin if you keep that 20 bucks in BTC it will increase in value
@_date: 2017-11-16 06:25:58
good job bro I believe you bought the dip and now the price has increased you already made profit. lol
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:01:35
lol dude.
@_date: 2017-11-16 06:33:08
I believe b/c there is a limit. But if you are just practicing you should switch to litecoin on gdax and use litecoin to transfer to wallets fees are negligible. Bitcoin is a store of value so moving it around today will incur fees. In the future you will be able to transact  smaller BTC amounts the updates are coming soon. 
@_date: 2019-06-06 22:16:55

@_date: 2017-11-16 06:23:36
Go on YT and watch Richard Heart BTC videos. He helped me understand a lot. Also did you see the comeback? Bitcoin can't be stopped, altcoins are just distractions. BCH is so unnecessary bc LTC was already there with a better development team and cheap transactions. Why try to split bitcoin? bc they are controlled by miners bc they are centralized and bc they are just tryign to steal the brand. 
@_date: 2019-12-05 23:32:00
Still haven’t answered if private key or not lul.
@_date: 2017-11-16 06:25:02
you can also use breadwallet for bitcoin or loafwallet for litecoin they are both made by bitcoin developers for your iphone. But yeah ledger or Trezor or other options. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 06:27:57
do you mean transact yes dont send your coins to the wrong address lol. 
@_date: 2019-12-24 15:14:21

breadwallet is a great phone app. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:57:18
oh sorry fiat is basically usd. And yes 1st you transfer your usd to coinbase then to gdax (free) then on gdax buy bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-06-22 20:37:23
My dude you could have gotten in at 4K now you want to get in at 10 k. I mean you can it’s really never too late. But you have to be okay with it going down to 5k potentially. But you can also offer your services for bitcoin. You don’t have to have a degree if you are really good at something let the community know. A lot of us are looking for people that would like to accept bitcoin for work.

@_date: 2017-11-16 06:15:42
choose your mining pools carefully. Pools now have lead to centralization so make you join a pool that is upholding Bitcoins values, and not pools that are trying to undermine it.

yes specially if the trading is free. Gdax the trades are free so its a good way to learn .
@_date: 2019-12-21 00:41:29
Hopefully BTCpay
@_date: 2017-11-16 06:14:25
I never heard of Buybitcoinworldwide.com   so be careful and do reaserch first. But with crypto you just need to open an account with exchanges in that country, usually you will be limited to only trading in crypto and not fiat.

Some one send this a hacker friend that can find the IP address of where this is coming from. We need to create a decentralized open-sourced security team for bitcoin that can keep track on these type of people trying to scam users.    Or it could be like natural selection where the people that don't do their research completely thoroughly  etc get weeded out. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 02:01:02
Sorry to break it to you bro but you should have supported Trezor for a hardware wallet since it is open source. Ledger is supported by intel and their firmware is not open sourced so who knows what data they are collecting or flaws, etc. If you are going to be in this space you need to look for and support open sourced decentralized software and coins. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 16:48:24
In the future, the people who own alot of btc will start companies etc and workers will get paid in Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 22:04:34
I dont understand why i have to give my business to such a company or visa when i can just use my wallet to pay someone or a store in bitcoin or litecoin. All these companies are just trying to profit of this community when they should be building companies that will actually help humanity. MIddle men are not needed thats the point of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-22 18:25:35
Which is why i use Trezor. The firmware is not open sourced, as some people seem to believe. 
@_date: 2018-03-10 01:23:11
They always get too comfortable and slip up. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 02:07:55
The point of open sourced is that if any bigger entity such as a government want to enforce lets say a code that tracks users w/e idk if it is closed source we will never know. Also the people that get hired by such companies are not necessarily the best coders because they probably got the job from a friend who knows a friend who knows a friend etc. Maybe you dont care b/c you only transact with small amounts but people in crypto move large amounts and i would never trust a closed source company, its also against my principles. If you guys don't realize this open sourced projects will free the whole world. Just look at 3-d printing for houses, b/c its closed sourced people can't benefit from this cost saving technology.

For cold storage I suggest you go for Trezor because it is open sourced and Ledger does not want to keep its program open sourced and is funded by only one company Intel. Go for the open sourced Trezor for guaranteed privacy.

Be careful with cash app guys. You don’t hold your keys and cash app is a for profit centralized organization. Buy bitcoin from a decentralized source or at least a source that is not new and is reliable and the learn how to send it to an open sourced wallet.     Some people might benefit from using cash app because they might not be responsible enough to hold their own keys. If you can’t just stick to apps like cash app. But if you want a challenge read a lot first. -����

@_date: 2018-04-15 16:16:32
No because bitcoin makes you your own bank. You have the key for the wealth. You own them as you have the keys. No one controls bitcoin no one can seize anyone’s bitcoin without the persons keys. Other altcoins, however, are indeed centralized and can be seized and nullified etc etc. Which is why bitcoin is unique it is decentralized, no one owns it m, no one can use their force to do anything. They would have to leave the internet world and physically torture you to give up your keys which is unlikely right.

Bitcoin is trust-less and permission-less the people don’t need the govt to use it. This are the properties of a truly decentralized currency Bitcoin owned by no one and therefore can’t be bargained with. Unlike the rest of the centralized coins.

Firstly Bittrex doesn’t do major volume in fact it is a relatively small exchange. For now it just means less noobs will loose money on alts. Bitfinex and Korean and Japanese exchanges are the major Bitcoin movers in this space.

Dam yeah if he has that amount of money he should bring like 4 bodyguards. Also idk I wouldn’t be able to do that, I would be freaked out.   There needs to be a better way, I just hate that there are always bad actors that we have to looking out for. Did the guy get caught? I mean he should have had someone else with a drone watching their movements etc. I mean tech allows extra security and people just don’t want to use it. 
Edit: okay I read he got caught. I just hope this doesn’t give other people ideas and cause this thing to decrease. Trust is so important.
@_date: 2018-04-23 20:38:23
So this guy went from Solar Mining to OTC. Do you have any official information to know you are legit?
@_date: 2018-04-21 21:17:29

He just needs to work for bitcoin that’s all.

Omg never meet in person what the heck.! 
@_date: 2018-04-05 13:05:34
The only negative I see is that maybe people working in banks will be out of jobs just like miners went out of jobs but things will just transition and education will transition with the economical change. It’s completely normal. Just look at the paper business. It will be harmful and beneficial at the same time. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 13:05:39
Nothing much the difficulty will just go down and yeah some miners might looose but those that remain will enjoy less competition until people it’s profitable etc etc cycle cycle. Merry go round. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 20:30:48
The way you are going to see segwit increase in use is by everyone using their power and stop being lazy. Not by sending emails (although that helps), but by NOT using any service that is not segwit compatible. Businesses exchanges wallets will all feel the effects. Next we need to make sure that newcomers understand the importance of segwit so when they join the bitcoin space they will be informed enough to use their power (bitcoin) the right way, in terms of continuing the goal of advancing the network. But no one is doing that, so entities don’t feel like they need to bother with segwit. Make them feel that it is important! 
@_date: 2018-04-16 15:41:19
They should have just named it cryptocart or blockcart. It’s hard to say I am selling my stuff on blocksscart (facepalm)

That was actually FUD no one sold anything lol

Woow nice bro!!! I was actually browsing for the Trezor T but it was sold out lol. Now we know why.

Crypto gives you power. That’s means you have to become responsible. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 23:32:18
Localbitcoins.com      Everyone used this before major exchanges. Just do your research and you should be fine. Until decentralized exchanges on EOS become a thing localbitcoins is the way to go. And send your bitcoins to a segwit enabled wallet. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 15:30:10
Also the best scam is the one that preys on the crypto communities sympathy bone. “I put all my savings into bitconnect and make a video crying about it”  easy money.

Someone give me 1 BTC also. I really it.
@_date: 2018-04-15 19:18:49
Exactly! Most people in the future will receive their bitcoin from employers not mining or exchanges. People with the best skills will ask their interviewers if they pay in bitcoin. And if they don’t they will take their skills elsewhere.

Because we want results. Don’t take our money and not produce results. But on all seriousness I don’t think it’s a bad thing. We just want to get to the moon now. Okay everyone should be working to go to the moon and then mars. No wasting time. Now go finish the product you sold me! Lolol

Dude use a better wallet from bitcoin.org and that has segwit. I never had a time issue. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 14:31:47

@_date: 2018-04-15 16:12:33
But even during world war 3 not all countries will be in war. Certainly not Iceland and Canada. And if their was something bigger, then using bitcoin won’t even matter at that point. Basic survival would be paramount.

Most people in this space are people with money specially does on bitfinex market buying or selling 100 btc is nothing.

These dummies keep allowing the govt and to get the bitcoin at no cost at all. Seriously, if you are about to get caught why not just donate your bitcoin to the Bitcoin community or some non profit organization. Facepalm. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 15:06:55
I didn’t mean it that way but I’ll delete my comment bro. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 18:04:03
Your survey is a little confusing? The green part shows a different questions (have you ever had bitcoins stolen from you) while the lower questions asks if you own bitcoin. What’s that about?
@_date: 2018-04-05 12:58:33
Thanks bro! I hope newcomers can also come to understand this space and experience the community-feel, and ultimately what it means to give to the community instead of trying to take advantage of it. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 14:55:31
Oh if I had the power like a lot of this early bitcoiners, I would dedicate my life to doing it and to create real life projects that are useful for the community. A lot of early bitcoiners forgot what made them successful and haven’t given back as much to the bitcoin community. I mean how many useless ico’s are there with billions of support. And bitcoin only gets 2.5 million come on. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 17:56:07
People were saying that it wasn’t challenging enough.

You should post on their reddit page if you haven’t already.

1. You can’t sell a larger chunk on an exchange. 2. Just to an OTC desk. 3. OTC buys and sells don’t affect price.
@_date: 2018-04-27 03:37:35
Bc tether is there.
Edit: misspelling
@_date: 2018-04-06 09:31:46
I am sorry about that bro the best you can do is buy a mining rig and mine it. Bitcoin is permisionless and trustless you don’t need anyone’s permission to use it just mine it or work for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 13:34:47
Bitpay is going against what the community wants and they are purposely charging higher fees. BTCPAY is what is used by the community since it has segwit activated, however, when LN apps come out well use either Eclair or Zap
@_date: 2018-04-21 23:35:25
It makes me happy to know that other people understand crypto.  Perfect answer, not to mention most if not all of these Alt coins have most of their coins funds locked up in said Alt coin company, so that the actually value of the coin is severely inflated.
@_date: 2018-04-13 15:37:40
INSIDE JOB bc they did not provide the address of where the funds went just like every other big hack. Instead they said that “hackers took it without a trace” this people don’t know anything about the bitcoin lol this is why centralized power is bad. Humans are fallible, math is not. We need decentralized exchanges running on EOS. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 06:09:59
This is some scary sh3t. This just shows you how much pressure these centralized entities are under by Big Brother. This is scary af and all of you should be scared. This is like saying I need to show someone my I’d to buy sugar from my neighbor or from the grocery store. This just shows you how unyielding the bigger powers are. They don’t want to loose their grip. And all we are trying to do is to innovate. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 14:42:13
Eclair is already live for androids. However more qualities are being added which requires coding time. Maybe buy the devs some pizza! Lol
@_date: 2018-04-07 21:37:57
Which is why you should be careful with what you post bro. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 16:03:44
Also you should have added that bitcoin.org is the non-profit open sourced version. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 03:14:25
Dude Tether makes a tiny fraction of bitcoins market.
The only coin I adore is bitcoin. If I need to use tether in other for me to use my bitcoins in the way I want to like post a trade then that’s what I will use. You don’t understand the purpose of tether. Everything has a purpose dude. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 12:39:28

@_date: 2018-04-22 18:02:23
Wohooooooooo banks lost! 
@_date: 2018-04-13 15:48:55
it IS actually an INSIDE JOB because they said that the hackers stole it without a trace. They don’t even know that bitcoin transactions are public. They never posted the address like all the other exchanges! This is why CENTEALIZation DOESNT WORK and why all these altcoins are shit. bitcoin is the only decentralize coin and we need a Decentralized EXCHANGED on eos!!

@_date: 2018-04-27 17:10:42
Oh I get it. You can try. If the funds are still there it should work. If it’s on the chain waiting  to be verified it might not be able to be reversed lol

Yes the difficulty will decrease so that transactions can be “solved” faster etc. And I am not sure what you mean by manipulate the entire block chain? Each block depends on the previous block which depends on the previous block so it is an unbreakable chain.

Why would you use bitpay they charge very high fees. Use a wallet that supports segwit. And isnt killing people with fees. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 05:54:54
I just sent some it’s real guys thank you!! 
@_date: 2018-04-14 02:14:20
You can also use local bitcoins I mean you don’t have to meet with them you just deposit the money and they send you the bitcoin. 
Edit: and since it’s  a small amount it shouldn’t be risky. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 16:52:47
Use local bitcoins or other apps.

Oh India. Yeah it’s probably not worth it. However they are making rigs now that can be inundated in water. But yeah goood luck bro try contacting tether they are the best bet. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 09:34:38
And now you realize why we had to use f-king TETHER!! And all you noobs were just being sheep spreading FUD about tether. Tether was made bc banks were colluding to block people from buying crypto. Just buy it through local bitcoins or directly with tether or mine it. Bitcoin is permissionless and trustless no govt can stop it.
@_date: 2018-04-06 16:39:43
You can be comfortable with 5 rigs which doesn’t cost a kidney. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 02:25:54
Lol bitstamp? Haha they inflate their trading volume bc no fees to trade. Bitfinex has fees to trade. 
In fact, most exchanges that went to or past 20k were at exchanges that did not have USDT ex: Coinbase and your bitstamp. Lol dude you are delusion or just a bank puppet. 
@_date: 2018-04-19 09:18:21
Do you not understand the concept of it’s a joke bro.  
@_date: 2018-04-22 15:06:18
I don’t need to do that. You just go to tether.io website and it shows the total amount of tethers and what you will find the ratio will be very small. But we just have to agree to disagree.

@_date: 2018-04-15 07:04:37
Oh I understand what you are saying. 
Yes, there could theoretically be a large disruption that could cripple the bitcoin system. 
That would be so hard basically impossible. As long as bitcoin mining remains decentralized it would be hard to destroy everyone’s hardware. In fact, it would just create a massive in-flux of new mining interest because of the bonanza of problems to solve. 
And the mining race will start all over again.   
@_date: 2018-04-07 19:11:51
We had a 3 year bear market. All I can say is the usd price doesn’t matter. Unless you are trying to cash out bc you put your whole life savings in it. (I hope you didn’t) In a couple years, you won’t need to cash out. In fact, the most people will not accept pay for work unless it is in Bitcoin.
