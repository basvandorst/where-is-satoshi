.....ummm...what? 
Reality is anti-Trump. These liberals get dumber every day.
@_date: 2018-01-26 03:08:48
Call them?
@_date: 2018-01-25 22:21:00
I believe we will see a fair drop tomorrow. Around 10%
@_date: 2018-01-29 11:55:40
Way too early. Buy at 10k
@_date: 2018-01-26 06:56:50
It will dip, how much is anyone’s guess.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:26:19
Hold me with your strong hands.
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:32:37
Uhhhh ok?
@_date: 2018-01-20 13:53:36
The first paragraph pisses me off already.
@_date: 2018-01-28 08:51:12
Ohh please. More anti-Trump bullshit.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:58:47
Here, take a down vote.
@_date: 2018-01-26 03:07:50
I see a 10% drop tomorrow easy.
Edit: Looks like we have some butthurt people here.
I will be back to say I told you so.
“He insulted the Bitcoin by saying there will be a dip!?!?!?”
And it’s already started the dip. :)
Edit 2: ohh look from $11500 to $10450! Look who was right...again!

You can’t pirate something you have legal rights to.
@_date: 2018-03-15 07:12:41
I got lost on my quest.
@_date: 2018-03-17 04:40:06
“This is why banning Bitcoin worldwide is the best thing that could happen!”
Everything that happens is always a good thing here. 
It’s getting bad now because no one is going to take a stand when companies/governments take steps to hurt crypto.

Ya, let me go searching reddit a few months back for some random posts lol.
@_date: 2018-02-09 21:47:23
Be ready for another dip or two. It’s not there just yet.
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:49:49
Heard this before about 10k after it hit 18k.
@_date: 2018-03-17 12:42:49
Lol pathetic.
@_date: 2018-02-23 00:38:56
@_date: 2018-02-15 04:36:45
Just remember this when it drops again in a week or two. HODL we will see that 20k before you know it.
@_date: 2018-02-01 09:18:03
Yup. This dude has it exactly right.
If you made millions then where is it?
@_date: 2018-02-23 21:00:31
In the US? It’s never zero.
If you make a profit after 50 years there is still tax on it.
@_date: 2018-02-27 11:00:35
Heard this before.
@_date: 2018-03-17 11:00:16
That state is disgusting.
@_date: 2018-03-09 06:06:19
Don’t do it! Was in contact with Coinbase about this weeks ago.
Confirmed scam.
@_date: 2018-03-17 12:26:10
You are spot on. We will see a drop, just a matter of how much. $500 does seem like a fair estimate.
