Right the difference is major firms in the US have strict patent laws that protect them, that allow them to use the force of the state to threaten others that copy their design. IP law sucks and its a Good thing that bitter people can't legally take down BitcoinCash. All they are doing is something you don't like. Tough cookies.

I understand i hold a minority position on the costs and benifits of patent and copyright. But it isn't as simple as hating innovators and loving sweat shops. 
The truth is IP enforcement comes at a cost, and there are many people who argue the costs outweigh the benefits.  My opnion is that innovation is harmed greatly by patent and copyright law, and i would like to see more not less.

You are only concerned because you can't tell it's a silly joke :)

Bullshit. Also called "a joke" :)

Currencies are commodities.
Hoarding is saving. 
Buying low selling high is what everyone tries to do with everything. That just means it's a good or service.

We should get armed monopolies of arbitration to regulate what we can and can't do with BTC. 
/s ;)

This may sound insignificant to you, but that's the first bitcoins anyone has ever sent to me, and I will remember this for a long time.

No one needs a centralized monopoly on money creation. No one needs a central bank tied to a nation-state. 
End the Fed

Deflation is better than inflation. Inflation discourages savings and investment and incourages debt. Deflation incourages saving and investment.

Japan's lost decade was not due to deflation. The fastest growth in american history was in a deflationary period. There are a myriad of variables that go into an economy's growth, one variable is not enough to easily point to a conclusion. Several economists disagree on this issue.

Spending is not ipso facto a positive thing, and less jobs is not always a negative. We can increase jobs over night by switching from industrial plough to shovels, or from shovels to spoons, this does not increase the wealth of an economy.
