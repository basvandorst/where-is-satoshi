Also them pretending that trump could have possibly written a multi page tweet that is actually coherent and spelled correctly.

I think for a lot of us the problem is “my crypto has less and less buying power every day. What once could have bought me a car can’t buy a bag os skittles.” If you bought at ATH you aren’t spending it today because it means you are loosing an absurd amount in fiat value.

It sounds to me like you’re more about general sexual liberation? Why not just say that? I don’t think you are using the term sexism in a way that people are going to understand. Save yourself the headache man!

It says you want to preserve sexism? The rest of it sounds like you are trying to preserve sexual freedom, not sexism. Is that a mistake?

Personally I think it’s a great idea to use sexuality as tool to spread btc and cryptocurrency awareness. It might be a little juvenile, but it’s been very effective for other industries, so why not bitcoin? Sexism is specifically related to discrimination, and I just don’t see how that fits in with your larger message. Men like boobs, women like boobs,, most people like boobs. It’s great to embrace that! That’s not sexist, that’s “sex-positive.” Those two things are very different and One will serve your cause well while the other will only attract angry incels.
