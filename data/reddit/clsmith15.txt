I keep seeing this idea of BitFinex using cash from the haircut for some sinister purpose.  There is no cash from the haircut, the haircut was just a reallocation of assets between user accounts.  There was no gain.

Except the coins came from the 1BfxSux... address that is known to be controlled by the hacker.  More likely the hacker took all the reddit accounts that submitted an address and found one he could crack the password for.  Then immediately edit the winning comment before "randomly" selecting it, changing the address to one he controls.  Then he sends coins to himself.
He checks all the addresses submitted to see if there is one he can compromise (for instance a brain wallet with an easy password to crack).  Then "randomly" selects that address, transfers the coins in, and transfers the coins out to an address he controls.  You'll notice that the coins have [already moved from the winning address.](
This whole thing is just a smokescreen, he spends the entire balance in the 1BfxSux... address giving out coins at "random", some to strangers and some to addresses he controls, so that it's hard to distinguish which addresses are owned by innocent bystanders and which are owned by him.
In any case, STOP HELPING THIS CRIMINAL OUT BY COOPERATING WITH HIM.

Of course they haven't, and won't, open their books.  I can't have verification, but it's only logical that a previously successful business that is now in danger of going down the tubes would do everything possible to avoid that.  I think this is much more likely than a previously successful company risking the future of the company on a fraudulent scheme with a low possibility of success (not to mention risking the personal assets and freedom of those involved in such a scheme if found guilty in a criminal case).

I'm far from an expert here so take everything I say with a grain of salt.
My worry is that bitfinex sets each user up with individual wallets so that in cases like this, they can basically wash their hands of any responsibility to refund affected customers' losses.  The argument is "Hey, these wallets belong to the users, not us.  We have the private keys so that we can initiate transactions on their behalf, but the risks of ownership lie solely with the customer."  Just look through [this post history]( and you can see that this attitude is evident.


Yes... of course. All of users' bitcoin is held in individual accounts.




It looks like they haven't officially decided whether or not to treat this as a loss to individual accounts or as a loss to everyone.  But I'm concerned that they've tried to leave themselves a loophole to skirt any liability in situations such as this.
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:15:21
I suppose that's fine.  The guy clearly wants a list of legitimate addresses, to what end I'm not sure, but it can't be good.  I think the mods, and the reddit admins, should do everything in their power to prevent him from getting what he wants.
@_date: 2018-01-25 23:12:00
Because there is always counterparty risk if you store your coins with a third party.  And I can never know what security steps are actually taken to secure funds.  If that information were public then it wouldn't be secure.  And because, as another user pointed out, as an individual I am not an attractive target for a thief.
If I control my keys then I am in complete control of my funds and can make them as secure as I want.  I can keep backups in as many or as few locations as I like.  I can write my seed phrase in steel to prevent it from being destroyed by fire or water.  I can split my funds into multiple wallets.  And I never have to rely on anyone else to access my funds.
Again, both methods have pros and cons.  And both have risks.
@_date: 2018-01-25 22:19:54


Why doesn't the risk matter when they keep coins in cold storage, but does matter if an individual wants to keep coins in cold storage?
Both approaches have pros and cons, neither is inherently better or more secure than the other.

I don't know about the Shift card, but coinbase effectively charges a transaction fee on normal transactions by selling coins to customers slightly above market and buying coins from customers slightly below market.  But even if the Shift card is different and there really is no conversion fee, you're still foregoing the cash-back you get with most credit cards.  So there is a cost to using a Shift card, people just have to decide for themselves if supporting bitcoin is worth that cost.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but since there is a cap on the number of bitcoins, we can say with certainty that if bitcoin reaches a market cap of *x* then 1 BTC will be worth at least *y* dollars.
For example, if bitcoin reached a market cap of $500 million (roughly 5% of USD), with a maximum of 21 million bitcoins:
$500 billion / 21 million BTC = $23,809.52/BTC

I find it ironic that OP seems to be championing Buffett's cause, when Buffett himself is a huge believer in ignoring the day to day valuation of an investment and instead focusing on its long-term value.

It matters because is it really news that someone who owns bitcoin thinks that it is going to increase in value?  Also, he has clear incentive to try to make people more confident in bitcoin, since more confidence leads to greater value for his holdings (I'm not suggesting that this guy has nearly enough sway to influence the market significantly, but the incentive is still there).  His opinion is clearly biased, that doesn't necessarily mean he's wrong, but it should be taken with a grain of salt.

No, the moral thing to do is to pay for what you consume.  Not consume whatever you want and decide if it was worth paying for later.  Seriously, is spending 5-30 seconds watching an ad that much to ask?  When you were going to spend that time dicking around on the internet anyway?

From an accounting/auditing standpoint, it's far more important to prove that you own the bitcoin you say you do than it is to prove you don't own more bitcoin than you say you do.  The concern for an auditor would be: the company claims they purchased X bitcoin for Y dollars, but without proof, how do I know that the CEO/CFO/whoever didn't just steal the money and claim that it was used to purchase bitcoin?  It's an interesting scenario that I hadn't considered, and one that there was to be an answer for if bitcoin is to be adopted by large retailers, or just about any public company.  I wasn't aware of the Verify function, but that sounds like an effective solution.  In fact, it sounds a whole lot easier and cheaper than a bank confirmation, which is something auditors have to do to confirm the existence of cash balances.

It's not a perfect analogy, no.  Visiting a website is not like walking by a house.  Walking by a house doesn't cost the owner anything, but you visiting a website does.  They have hosting costs, not to mention the costs of producing whatever content that site has.  Viewing ads is the price of the content.  If you use AdBlock, you are plain and simple stealing the content of the website.  You are getting something from the website, the website is getting nothing from you.
The best analogy I can come up with is entering a park or museum without paying admission.  The only difference is a website is only asking you to pay with a few seconds of your time, or a few pixels of your screen.

By paying your ISP you are supporting the internet infrastructure, that's it.  That doesn't entitle you to any content that others are sharing on the internet.  They can charge you for it, give it to you for free, or give it to you in exchange for you viewing ads.  If you access the content and block the ads, you are stealing that content.
There are plenty of sites that completely depend on ad revenue to pay their bills.  They can't continue operating without ad revenue.  The fact that you paid your internet bill gives them nothing.

Are you investing long-term and do you believe in the long-term future of bitcoin?  Personally I think that regardless of the short term impact of the ETF, the this is revolutionary technology that will continue to increase in value.  If you agree then it makes no sense to wait; even if the ETF is denied and the price drops, in the long run your investment will be profitable.  By not buying now you are only risking that the price will increase with the acceptance of the ETF and never return to this level again.

Not sure I agree with this argument.  Essentially for your transaction to be included it needs to have a fee in the top 1 MB of all transactions in the mempool.  It's not first-in, first-out.  So if your transaction is not immediately in the top 1 MB, there's really no telling when it will be confirmed.
@_date: 2017-03-09 04:38:00

@_date: 2017-03-09 03:24:25
To play devil's advocate, the whole point of Unlimited is to allow blocks to exceed 1 MB, so it's unfair to compare Core vs. Unlimited blocks of even sizes.  In practice they would never be same size.  Extrapolating this a bit, it looks like a 1.3 MB Unlimited block would have about as much transaction fees as a 1 MB Core block.  So it seems to me like miners would make more off Unlimited blocks once the average blocksize exceeds 1.3 MB (which doesn't seem far off).

The best advice I can give you is this: do some research and decide for yourself if you think bitcoin can become a legitimate and widespread payment system/store of value.  If you believe that it can, you believe that the price will rise as demand increases while supply is capped.

That's not quite accurate.  Of a $20 deposit the bank must hold $2 and can loan out $18.  That $18 can be deposited at another bank, which must hold $1.80 and can loan out $16.20.  If you keep repeating this process, ultimately you'll have a total of $200 in consumer bank accounts, $20 of which is actually held in the banks' reserves (the original deposit).

The reserve requirement is still 10% for banks with net transaction accounts exceeding $103.6 million, [source](  The overnight games thing you mention is also discussed in that section, basically their average reserve level over a period of time must equal or exceed their required level.

Which makes sense, because the supply is being cut so the price should rise to compensate.  The litecoin community is similarly giddy over their next halving, which will be in about a month.

I wish whoever coined the term "bits" had gone with 1/1,000th of a BTC instead of 1/1,000,000th.  1 dollar = ~3 bits seems much more practical to me

Effectively instead of selling your excess energy back to the grid, you're selling your excess energy to the bitcoin network.
@_date: 2015-07-12 22:49:55
Yeah, I guess I just wish there were an easier way to say "millicoin".  I hope you're right about the last part, but even with unbridled optimism that's probably a long way off.

10 minutes is only an estimate of block generation time.  If the hash rate rises then on average blocks are generated more quickly.  Bitcoin adjusts the difficulty every 2016 blocks so that the previous 2016 blocks would have been generated on average every 10 minutes.  But 2016 blocks is roughly every two weeks, so if the hash rate steadily rises then the difficulty will always lag behind the hash rate, and we could see the halving occur sooner.  Conversely, if the hash rate decreases, difficulty outpaces the hash rate, and the halving would occur later.

That's the real question, this is great as long as the $5 bonus is still there, not so great if it isn't.  I don't really want to be pressuring my friends into dropping $100 on bitcoin, I think that gives people the impression that bitcoin is a scam or a get-rich-quick scheme.  The $5 bonus is great though, it's pretty effective telling people they can try bitcoin out at no cost to themselves.  I'd like to keep doing this, and if someone ends up buying $100 worth and I get $25, great.

Gross margin itself is a comparison of revenue to costs.  Debt can't really be compared to either, it should be compared to assets.
I'd also point out that the purpose of a government is not to make a profit, its purpose is to spend money which is almost the exact opposite.

No faith required.  They just redeemed tokens at the full $1 value, not the market value of ~$0.45 at the time.

Of course not.  Just pointing out that you can't generalize like that.  I'd never buy a 0% yield security from Bitfinex, but I'd rather have that than nothing.
@_date: 2016-09-01 17:58:55
No one is.  A "bond" with a face value of $1 and 0% interest for has a positive yield when it sells for under $1.

What's the rationale for attributing this to central banking over some other industry?
@_date: 2016-09-01 19:32:51
Yeah, I think she's implying that "Bitfinex must be buying BFX tokens at market prices because someone is buying them, and no one other than Bitfinex would want to buy them".  So I was trying to address that particular scenario, though I don't know why she won't just come out and say directly whatever her point is.

Yes, but the statement reads to me like they are still considering the possibility of forcing equity in the future.
@_date: 2015-04-24 01:07:34
There is no incentive to wait only if you know with certainty that you are the last person to donate, which would never be the case.  Let's say the timer is at 12 minutes and you donate, resetting the timer to 12 minutes.  Then the timer runs down to 5 minutes, someone else donates, and they end up winning the pot.  If you had waited another 7 minutes, that person would have donated before you, and you would have won the pot.  In every case, it is beneficial to wait as long as possible before donating.
@_date: 2015-04-24 15:15:04
That's not what I'm saying at all.  Let me spell out this example for a third time.
Assume there are only two people left who are going to donate and the timer is at 12 minutes.  Person A thinks "there is no advantage to waiting until the timer runs low to donate, so I'll just donate now".  Yes, the timer resets, but now Person B is the last man standing and will win the pot.  On the other hand, if Person B's strategy is "I'll wait until there is 1 minute left to donate", then Person A will win the pot if their strategy is to wait even longer, say until 30 seconds remain.  In that case 11 minutes go by with no donations, then Person B donates.  11 minutes and 30 seconds go by, and Person A donates.  12 minutes go by, the time expires and Person A wins the pot.
Think of it another way, say 10,000 people including myself are going to compete for the pot.  The 9,999 other people believe there is no advantage to waiting for the timer to run low, so they all donate immediately.  Do you not see how I will win the pot every single time if my strategy is to wait until the last moment?
The only time it doesn't matter when you donate is if you are the last person to donate, and obviously you can never know that you will be last beforehand.  The dominant strategy for every player is to wait as long as possible before donating.
@_date: 2015-04-24 17:21:48
Look at my second example.  If that doesn't make it clear I don't know what will.
@_date: 2015-04-24 01:39:44
It's still not like you can donate as many times as you want, eventually you'll run out of money or decide to stop throwing money at it.  Just as every pot must sooner or later have a winner, every pot will have someone who made the second to last donation.  And if that person donated early in the timer, there's a good chance they would have won if they had waited.
@_date: 2015-09-25 22:23:51
Fair enough
@_date: 2015-04-24 00:16:49
There is still a big incentive to wait until the last second.  Say there are only two users left who are planning to donate to the pot.  The one that donates last will win.  Waiting until the last second is the dominant strategy for all users.

This is such a ridiculous argument.  No matter how you try to justify it, it is stealing pure and simple.  I mean I torrent stuff too, but at least I admit that it's stealing.
EDIT:  For fuck's sake, my point is that it's illegal/immoral.  "Stealing", "piracy", "copyright infringement", call it what you want, I'm not arguing semantics.

There is absolutely a market for blockspace, it is demonstrably subject to the forces of supply and demand.  Fees represent the price of blockspace.  Your argument seems to only attack the moniker "fee market" rather than the concept it represents.

Irrelevant and not even true.  There is not nearly enough market liquidity to support such large trades.

Lucky you...I visited Vietnam last summer and only found a handful of places that accepted Visa, much less bitcoin.  Although as far as fiat currencies go, the Dong has to be the most fun to use.  At least in conversation.

I don't think the idea that ethereum is some sort of scam is original around here at all.  But the inaccurate part is what concerns me more than the lazy part.
@_date: 2013-12-13 02:25:26
That's fair, I think we are just talking about a different type of investment.  I was referring to people who buy bitcoin with the intention of converting it back to fiat at some point in the future.  I agree, there's nothing bad about speculative investment as long as those investments are held until bitcoin is really useful as currency.  Ideally at that point there's no need to exchange back to fiat because bitcoin would be widely used.

No more lazy and inaccurate than "marketing spin will only take eth so far."
@_date: 2013-12-12 23:42:16
How so?  If your goal is to see bitcoin become widely used as currency, then you want to see prices stabilize so consumers won't be afraid to convert their holdings to bitcoin, and vendors won't be afraid to accept bitcoin.  If your goal is to turn a profit by buying low and selling high, then the price fluctuations brought about by speculation are great.

Peercoin claims to be more secure than Bitcoin in the long run, as well as more energy efficient.  If both of those things are true and Peercoin can build a large infrastructure, is it not possible that Peercoin could overtake Bitcoin?

Thanks for your help.  I'm still not convinced that first mover advantage alone is enough to stave off competition, in many industries  small improvements to the first mover's product end up becoming market leaders.  This is still a very young industry and there is a lot of room for growth.  Bitcoin certainly has the inside track, but I personally don't believe it's a sure thing yet.

@_date: 2013-12-12 22:34:56
I don't think that's necessarily true, I think the big issue is that people aren't going to want to use it as currency if there is a risk that it will lose a substantial portion of its value.  However I do think the value will steadily rise as bitcoin is more widely accepted, since demand for bitcoin will increase while supply stays roughly the same.
@_date: 2013-12-02 19:48:46
A lot of people say the same thing about bitcoin though.  A lot of the technical details are beyond me, but I'm wondering is bitcoin inherently better than any of the other coins out there, or is bitcoin's only real advantage that they were the first coin available and have the most market cap?

@_date: 2013-12-12 21:40:03
But really that's a good thing.  Speculators who view bitcoin as an investment hurt bitcoin in the long run.  Bitcoin will never gain widespread acceptance as currency unless the exchange rate stabilizes.
