Or OkCoin posted as CZ using his credentials, presumably if they acquired them from him working at OKCoin. Maybe he then saw this, deleted it, and changed his credentials. 
@_date: 2015-06-29 11:53:08
Yes of course. Let's say you buy Bitcoin for $250 and then turn around and sell it for $270, you just made $20!
Now the hard part. Buying at a good price, and being able to sell for a higher markup to make a profit. It's harder than you think, but if there is a demand for it in your area then you are good to go.

Search rank is okay. Maybe also *influence*, *[vc] funding*, and *age* could be part of the factorization. 
In addition, how have they contributed to the overall success of Bitcoin? Funding core devs? Contributing to core code? Making tools that are free and open source? Speaking at events/conferences or to private orgs/govts about the positives about Bitcoin? 
Just some random thoughts. I hope this helps.

Forget him, that's not what this is about. It's about the final commit process and how it's done. There is one final person who makes a decision to approve or reject the commit. If they are in disagreement with your commit, whether justified or not, they have the single authority to reject it. There needs to be a better process spread amongst all the core devs. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 15:00:56

If Gavin were to actually remove commit access from all the other core devs it would be a death blow to Gavin and Bitcoin. Nobody would trust him ever again. He is too smart for that.

Maybe I'm over simplifying, but the leap to 20MB now was such a stretch that others got terrified, possibly due to their own agendas where these big blocks won't let their ideologies prevail. Why not simplify this whole argument to make it utterly easy and predictable for everyone to agree on:
* 2016: 2MB
* 2017: 4MB
* 2018: 6MB
* 2019: 8MB
* 2020: 10MB
* etc... 
There should be no fork, otherwise we risk Bitcoin imploding. It should just gradually increase overtime.

I have to agree with the post linked and pasted below, that the BIP process isn't ideal. At it's simplest form, there is always one final central point person that has to approve the commit. I'm not sure why Garzik and one others don't get it or selectively choose to deny this fact. 
As far as the final say in getting a BIP committed, can't there be a rule in place that X-number of core devs have to sign off on it (90% for concensus)?
[quote below] [link](
Without looking up specific links I am confident people like Mircea 
Popescu will oppose just about any change.  Maybe they don't post their 
objection to Github but the point I am making is that no matter what 
change you make someone, somewhere will be against it.  Some of the 
developers think that Github is the only place that matters and that the 
only opinions that matter is a tiny group of insiders.  I don't think 
that way which is the reasoning behind my statement.
I am saying that after all the concerns are addressed as far as 
reasonably possible someone, somewhere has to decide whether or not to 
commit the changes to the official release.  Right now the only person 
who makes that decision if the version manager.  I agree it should not 
fall onto the shoulders of one person who is also very busy doing other 
things.  I am saying there should be some process to move forward and 
make decisions when needed.
Also, you already saw one of the Core developers calling me a "troll" 
and telling others to ignore my messages.  I have heard of several 
people who just drop out of the github discussions because of stuff like 
that.  They also delete message from Gihub discussions so that archive 
is not 100% credible.  I have seen things like a Github discussion 
between 3 or 4 people and then Garzik send out a tweet that there is 
near universal approval for the proposed change as it nobody is allowed 
to question it.  After watching the github process for a couple years I 
simply don't trust it because the developers in charge have a 
dictatorial style and they shut out many stakeholders instead of 
soliciting their opinions.  I view the Github system as the biggest 
centralized choke-point in Bitcoin and probably its biggest threat to 
its continued survival.  Anyone can come in and hire a couple core 
developers and veto any change they don't want.

Solution: stop being afraid of what others think. Be yourself. If you love Bitcoin, don't be afraid to say that you find it interesting and that you actually think it is useful. 
Mention the positive things, and say those "dark" things are just exploited to make Bitcoin look bad, but that it's used everyday but people who are not criminals that think Bitcoin is a positive new revolutionary technology.

Since you want to be a douche, it's "block chain" not Blockchain or blockchain. 
@_date: 2015-06-17 14:16:52
8MB is a stop-gap for now, with the assumption that year over year the blocksize will continue to be increased. I think what is also at debate is how the gradual increase will happen? I have no idea, but it's stupid there is still a "debate" going on when Gavin already said that he would compromise to 8MB now, maybe even 4MB I think he may have said in the bitcoindev email list somewhere. 
If the blocksize is increased now to let's say 4MB, the world is not going to collapse. It is a needed change. Jumping to 20MB is a leap, maybe it was too big of a goal and freaked people out. But the FUD going around that if we increase blocksize the sky is going to fall is lame and questions core devs real agenda. I'd be okay with a 2MB increase year over year, which is better than what it is now and should satiate those that are pissy about increasing at all. 
Edit: also I wanted to just say, though I'm in favor of the blocksize increase, I'm also not in favor of a hardfork to facilitate the 20MB increase. I'm anti-fork as it could cause detrimental damage to Bitcoin. Finding a good common ground is the way to go.

Announcing Sidechain Elements: Open source code and developer sidechains for advancing Bitcoin
Adam Back
We’re excited to announce the release of Sidechain Elements. Sidechains extend Bitcoin functionality through interoperable blockchain networks and today’s open source release includes an experimental sidechain that has a number of new working capabilities. With the release of Sidechain Elements, Blockstream is moving this effort into the community. We’re inviting developers to work with us, to test and use the code for their projects, and to share their proposals and code for additional capabilities.
Sidechains are decentralized, peer-to-peer networks that provide useful security, risk, and performance enhancements for global systems of value exchange that don’t need intermediaries, central banks or other third parties. They are distributed ledgers that are interoperable with each other and with Bitcoin, leveraging the most secure blockchain and code infrastructure in an additive way. Sidechains enable innovators to safely develop new applications without jeopardizing Bitcoin’s core code and putting billions of dollars worth of digital currency at risk.
We began our work on sidechains almost one year ago first through extensive discussions and debate with others in the technical community, and then in the publication of a whitepaperand launch of Blockstream. Over the past several months, we’ve been coding and testing initial implementations all in preparation for today’s release.
Sidechain Elements consists of several components: the core network software to build an initial testing sidechain, eight new features not currently supported by Bitcoin, a basic wallet, and the code for moving coins between blockchains. We’ve selected a collection of elements chosen to be both exciting and useful to three audiences with overlapping interests: the broader Bitcoin community; core technologists and smart-contract programmers; and businesses just starting to explore blockchain use cases. The new elements include Confidential Transactions, Basic Asset Issuance, Relative Lock Time and several others. We’ve posted a video of our CTO, Greg Maxwell, walking through all of new capabilities.
The initial sidechain included in Sidechain Elements works on a federated security model; while it’s still peer-to-peer and consensus-based, security for the blockchain is provided by a set of predefined functionaries in an arrangement called a Fed-Peg. A number of academic groups and individual contributors have agreed to run the Sidechain Elements Fed-Peg, including blockchain groups at Stanford, MIT, and Princeton. The sidechain does not include mining or proof-of-work at this point.
In the coming weeks, we’ll be publishing an early draft of a proposal for a fully decentralized, two-way peg and merge-mined sidechains, which will enable us to test other types of sidechain functionality.
Sidechains are an emerging technology, and this work is in its early stages. The code and working sidechain provide a basis for research and prototyping. We’ll undertake many of these efforts, and anticipate many others will happen independent of Blockstream with over 30 major financial institutions launching blockchain innovation projects, as well as interest in this tech from other Bitcoin and blockchain-based ventures.
Here be dragons: While much of the underlying science isn’t new, this is an alpha code release. We’ve intentionally focused on a Testnet sidechain and strongly urge others to avoid implementations that involve bitcoin or other real-world assets. Fiduciary code like this requires significant peer review before moving onto production environments.

I thought about this and thought having an immutable ledger where patient records cannot be forged is a brilliant application. All too many times patient records are modified or lost. The block chain changes all that. 
The major downside is hippa is private and records cannot be shared with anyone except the patient, doctor, and insurance. The block chain is open, so anyone would be able to see the records. Although, it could be just hashes of the record so possibly masking the actual information. I don't know a lot about colored coins but maybe that could be a solution.

so, i think this is awesome, and bitreserve is doing great things. kudos to them! but in the same token, isn't bitreserve just doing offchain transactions, holding, and then dispersing using their own database? essentially they are a centralized org like western union or paypal passing data back and forth? i don't know a lot about them, so just curious who knows.

Those are great quotes, thanks for linking to that. I wonder if Satoshi really knew though how centralized mining would/could become? If we scale up too fast, mining will become even more centralized than it already is, which is one argument. I'm a in favor of raising the block limit but not taking huge leaps which could risk decentralization.

Unfortunately since some core devs who have a major say in what happens, are against increasing the block size, there is a stalemate. All of reddit could be for increasing block size, and it wouldn't change a thing. As long as "core" devs are against it, it won't happen. 
The biggest challenge Bitcoin faces right now isn't scaling. It's coming to a consensus. 
@_date: 2015-06-17 01:31:36

imo, bitcoin has already succeeded. if you are focusing on the price, you should understand that the bubble of $1000 was an anomaly i think... partly due to market manipulation (mtgox/bots).
if you look at the market today, everyone is talking about bitcoin. lots are using it, and many more know about it and are thinking about how to use it in the future. tech moves fast, but at the same time, it takes time for everyone to get on board and use it too. it could be another year or two before we see some more real progress.

There is no 2FA bypass that I'm aware of unless the user was on Tor and fell victim to a MITM attack. If you haven't been using Tor there is nothing to worry about. You should also have 2FA on your email, not just your wallet.

I agree with you but let's not also forget a lot of these devs "volunteering" to work on bitcoin because they have already made a killing because they we're here early on. So if you think they are struggling for money and are just being super generous, you should think about it more. 
@_date: 2014-12-06 17:22:25
All the the issues were due to bad Tor exit nodes and people leaving team viewer open. These aren't faults of Blockchain.info, and even they made an .onion address on Tor to make the connection secure. But yet people find a way to blame them. 
I'd be more pro toward this decision if there were clear guidelines for wallets on Bitcoin.org, but there aren't. This is just a subjective witch hunt.

- confiscate all coins under custody at companies / take employees to jail
Not fully possible. Only some coins could be confiscated if the owners give up the private keys. Employees could go to jail, but not likely. 
- shut down the internet
Not likely and doesn't matter. Bitcoin is global. 
- mine to get 51%
Not likely. Google Andreas Antonopolous and 51% attack. 
- snipe large publically known Bitcoin owners
See above about going to jail. 
- outlaw any company from accepting it otherwise cease to employ anyone in said country
Basically a Bitcoin ban. Plausible as some countries have already done this. 
- increase taxes for Bitcoin
Not likely. You can't take something without knowing all identity info which isn't guaranteed in Bitcoin.

Basically this is what it comes down to. The beauty of Bitcoin is you don't need a middleman and can continue to trade value between person A and person B. But do you trust that person? You can use a service like Coinbase or circle to mitigate risk. But with escrow services that LocalBitcoins has, that also helps reduce the risk and not have to go through a middleman.

Correct. No 2FA on your wallet is asking to be hacked. Passwords are not enough anymore. Passwords can be brute forced in seconds/minutes. In addition, those that do backups and store info in their email tied to their account, need 2FA on their emails too. 
Everyone upset (rightfully so) they lost btc, I get it, but none had 2FA on. OP wants to make a point about Blockchain yet, nobody is being their own bank and uses full security.

Right, so the VC would dump $X amount of money into an exchange for a bitcoin matching program.

2) Yes, there are lots of hosted wallets including Coinbase which is listed on Bitcoin.org as a recommended wallet. There is nothing wrong with hosted wallets for a "hot wallet" for quick spending.
3) Using Bitcoin as an investment vehicle is perfectly fine. Some want to use it because of its revolutionary way of exchanging value, or because of the Blockchain, or to speculate, whatever.

I bought a new xbox a year ago and have spent the past year plagued with issues. Ive sent it back to Microsoft once and now have to a second time (more issues). And yet, they want to charge $99 now to send it in for a fix, for their shitty unit that I paid $399 for! What a waste of money.

As opposed to a closed source company that gives no details at all? It's funny to me that you give BC.i so much shit but you can check the code yourself. Other companies don't even publish their code at all.

Hi Greg, I read a really good article earlier explaining sidechains. Basically they said it's great except that in order to defend against a 51% attack, it requires merged mining. The argument was/is, merged mining promotes centralized mining. 
My question is, does merged mining actually promote centralized mining? If so, how?
In my opinion, we are no closer to "centralized" hashing power now in the current state of mining. Will merging the mining together make it worse?

@_date: 2014-12-22 15:59:23
ha! i didn't mean it in a way where I'm explaining bitcoin in a fully descriptive way to a hesitant merchant. it's more along the lines of...
me: do you accept bitcoin?
merchant: no, what's that?
me: bitcoin is a new popular digital currency just like dollars (*I live in the US*). you can use it to pay for things. a lot of merchants are beginning to accept it, you should check it out. 
Again, this isn't meant to teach them much, but either find out if they accept it or not. If not, the hope is that others will ask to, and either by them asking or me asking, it will prompt the merchant to look into bitcoin for accepting payments in the future.

This makes a lot of sense and I can totally see this in the future. But why hail a cab, when you can open your 'taxi app' and geo-locate one near you and request a cab ride?
It's completely automated start to finish. 
* request cab via app
* in app, enter final destination address
* driverless cab arrives and already knows what to charge you based on geo-location and destination address 
* scan qr code in back of cab to pay taxi fee due for upcoming ride
* get taxi ride to destination
* finished

ChangeTip just makes it more user friendly. Users can still send bitcoins to others without it. But without knowing their bitcoin address, you'd have to ask them for it before tipping. Being able to integrate it into platforms (like reddit) allows us (the users) to bypass that part, and just tip using their usernames.

so let me ask you - why aren't the rest of the wallets just removed, and each one reviewed to a certain standard.  What you and saivann are failing to see, that the community is up in arms about, is the unfairness that has taken place here. Why was BC.i targeted, and the rest of the wallets weren't mentioned?
You clearly say above no wallets are perfect. Ok so BC.i isn't either. But the rest get the seal-of-approval??

I don't even understand his point in these particular sentences:


The part in particular that is confusing, is the pseudonyms that are "catching up." What do you think he means by that? What does it mean for a fake name to catch up to his real name - as in - to connect the two names together?
If he means to connect the two, then yes, it sounds like "Nick Szabo" is his real name, and his fake online identities haven't been connected to that yet. 
OR, does he mean, it took him several years to create the identity "Nick Szabo", and that name *PLUS* whatever other fake identities he has created, may take a long time to "catch up" (gain reputation online / be trusted)?
**EDIT** Just adding to this instead of making another comment ;)
But wow, no wonder "Nick Szabo" hasn't shown his real identity or is resistant to these types of claims -- it's because he has been fighting about his "identity" for over 20 years!
Check this out, these are the threads leading up to the email that OP posted:
Clearly back in the day there were many-a-flame-wars about fake identities, and Nick was accused of being a fake identity for someone else, with possibly, other identities.
Then there is this thread:
Where again, Nick is being attacked! Clearly, people had it out for him, so obviously he keeps his identity safe guarded.
At some point, Perry Metzger vouched for Nick, saying he knew he was real and knew all his real life information (apparently saying Nick Szabo is his real name too). I don't know, whoever Nick is, clearly has reason to be so guarded - just like Satoshi.

99% in cold storage, 1% in a hot wallet, so about ~$600 in a hot wallet? More or less? I guess we don't truly know how much is kept in their hot wallet, but i would think on a heavy day 1% is not nearly enough.

Huh? Donations to registered nonprofits are allowed to have anonymous donors. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 16:23:45
that's the whole point of having a matching cap. this is actually used in other markets such as the nonprofit space.
it's pretty common for a company to match donations, let's say up to $100 per donor. so you donate $100, you get matched $100.
the same methodology can be applied to a bitcoin exchange. this would draw in huge amounts of users to said exchange. why would I go with Circle, if Coinbase matched my purchase up to $100?
It's a way to draw in users, get them locked into the platform, and also increase the incentive to buy bitcoins (in this current downward market). 
you seeing this? make it happen ;)

1) Buy Bitcoin from a "Bitcoin exchange" (basically convert dollars to Bitcoin). Some common and noob friendly exchanges are Coinbase.com and Circle.com. Check the [*sticky*]( post for those and others. 
2) After buying some bitcoins, you can use them just like real money. You'll see it's easy to use, is fast, secure, cheap, and less restrictive than credit cards.  You can send them places to buy things, such as xbox. 
3) After step 1 and 2, then go here and follow the instructions from Microsoft on how to buy digital content using bitcoins:

I don't know of any to model, but you guys are very smart. How about starting with criminal background checks of founders and officers of the member company?

Bad conduct doesn't mean it's a crime; but in the same token, you don't want bad apples in the foundation bringing down everything you work so hard to make.

Once again CCN has crappy reporting. The anonymous owner of Bitcoin.com didn't just switch from Blockchain to Okcoin. Blockchain had a legally binding contract for 5 yrs; so they can't just switch. 
This is pure speculation, but given the money Blockchain has had to spend recently to cover user losses, they probably sold out the rest of their contract to Okcoin to recoup a lot of money.

I tend to agree with you but how do you propose getting Bitcoin on national TV? I don't see the Bitcoin foundation doing it. Any other service or platform would of course be geared toward their own brand. The community isn't doing it. 
Pheeva went and paid for production and making the video. Is it geared toward them? Yes. Does it help bring eyes into Bitcoin that might not normally be on it? Yes. 
Edit: after reading this comment, I'd also prefer they remove out the part about drugs and Silk Road

Most people don't have problems with ads. The problems are you sell these "sponsored" stories. Sure there is a small sponsored label on the article, but most people overlook it and see this somewhat legitimate article mixed in with all your other non-sponsored stories. 
It's a very deceptive, immoral and unethical way to run a "reporting" website. Please cut the shit or gtfo.

Usually Twitter is good at that too, or at least shutting down the account completely until it's resolved.

2) After buying some bitcoins, you can use them just like real money. You'll see it's easy to use, is fast, secure, cheap, and less restrictive than credit cards.  You can send them places to buy things, such as xbox.

An attacker that controls more than 50% of the network's computing power can, for the time that he is in control, exclude and modify the ordering of transactions. This allows him to:
Reverse transactions that he sends while he's in control. This has the potential to double-spend transactions that previously had already been seen in the block chain.
Prevent some or all transactions from gaining any confirmations
Prevent some or all other miners from mining any valid blocks
The attacker can't:
Reverse other people's transactions
Prevent transactions from being sent at all (they'll show as 0/unconfirmed)
Change the number of coins generated per block
Create coins out of thin air
Send coins that never belonged to him
With less than 50%, the same kind of attacks are possible, but with less than 100% rate of success. For example, someone with only 40% of the network computing power can overcome a 6-deep confirmed transaction with a 50% success rate.
It's much more difficult to change historical blocks, and it becomes exponentially more difficult the further back you go. As above, changing historical blocks only allows you to exclude and change the ordering of transactions. It's impossible to change blocks created before the last checkpoint.
Since this attack doesn't permit all that much power over the network, it is expected that no one will attempt it. A profit-seeking person will always gain more by just following the rules, and even someone trying to destroy the system will probably find other attacks more attractive. However, if this attack is successfully executed, it will be difficult or impossible to "untangle" the mess created -- any changes the attacker makes might become permanent.

Bitcoin is money just like any other money. You keep money in your wallet. Bitcoin is digital money, so it's kept in a digital wallet. There are tons of places that offer wallet services, so don't be overwhelmed because there are so many choices. Do your homework and choose one that works best for you. Again, wallets are for holding your Bitcoin. You can purchase bitcoins through a Bitcoin exchange (think currency exchange). Bitcoins can be used just like money to buy things once you own some bitcoins. I hope this helped!

To me Bitcoin was never a replacement for cash. It's an online alternative to debit cards. It's fast, cheap, secure, private, and easy to use. 
Anytime I want to buy something online, digital goods/services, BTC is the way to go in my opinion. 
Edit: changed to debit cards

So who is the courier, let's say UPS or FedEx right? So just thinking this through, in their handheld digital device, they deliver the goods to the payer, and when they sign, the courier signs too, releasing the funds for the physical item. 
This would require companies like UPS to adopt Bitcoin and work in this digital signature flow. I like the idea tho. Maybe it could be the opportunity for a startup to get into delivery.

This is because of laws that FinCEN impose, where if you want to give out money, you must register as a money transmitter. Which introduces all kinds of rules such as KYC and AML. You can blame them, not bitcoiners, who simply don't want to go to jail for selling some coins.

What do you mean nothing - as in for free? They aren't charging for their API. Most places do not charge for APIs. They put rate limits on them mainly, to make sure it's not abused. Why would I have to submit them my ID, passport, bills, proof of residence, etc just to use their API? Some websites don't even require you register for the site at all, but I went ahead and signed up thinking they want to at least have your email - but they want way more than what is necessary in my opinion.

You don't understand how it works in the nonprofit space. For-profit companies will match donations *to* charities. An exchange would simply match the bitcoin up to a certain amount. Circle did something kind of like this, when they let the first 500 people or so get $10 in their account when they signed up. 
Matching is similar, but just a different way of doing it which promotes buying bitcoin with incentives.

I think your assumption they dump their entire btc rewards may be a stretch. Yes of course, any business is going to convert a % of their rewards for overhead.

They clearly see the value; and are mining to reap the rewards.

Bitcoin Foundation Hires Lobbying Firm
Backers of Virtual Currency Seek to Shape Government Oversight


Backers of the virtual currency bitcoin are beefing up their Washington presence as they seek to shape government oversight of the fledgling payment system.
The effort has been building since a number of federal agencies began examining bitcoin last year, but reached a milestone on Wednesday when the Bitcoin Foundation, the top trade organization for the new technology, announced it had retained a lobbying firm for the first time.


The lobbyists' role will be to build "a reservoir of goodwill that we can deploy when we need to avert a crisis," said Jim Harper, global policy counsel for the foundation, on a call with reporters Wednesday. "The best work will head off problems before they become interesting to all of you."


But whether bitcoin itself thrives will depend in large part on how Washington treats it. More regulatory requirements for bitcoin companies, higher tax charges, or other government actions could make bitcoin more expensive, undercutting some of its advantages over other ways of transferring money.

Then, one address is chosen through a proven random selection tool, and all the BTC is sent to that address for that time period.

I've always wondered this too, and not sure of the solution. Forgetting the domain and host, even if you start a project, it's difficult to get others to contribute in the beginning unless they see the same vision. I guess Satoshi went through the same troubles. Maybe the domain ownership login and credentials, including hosting, can be spread out among TRUSTED individuals, so it's spread out. But trusting is the hard part.... How do you trust strangers?

Dude, you clearly have a lot of bitcoin and blockchain expertise. It's time to stop telling people what they should do, and help them do it - if you so believe in the very thing you are asking others to live by.
Fly down to FL on your dime. Help Jason go through all the receipts, documentation gathering, bitcoin/blockchain addresses, and put it all together for him. **Donate YOUR TIME, and make this happen.** Stop asking a homeless outreach center to fulfill obligations when they are already strapped for time and cash. 
I believe in what you are saying, and in the traditional business organization sense, what you say is mandatory. For a nonprofit, that is strapped for cash and operating at a loss, this is asking a lot. Time is money, and unfortunately in Jason's case, time is homeless people not getting the help they need.

There are no PHP files in tumbr to edit. You can only edit css and main html. If there is a javascript solution or widget, you can embed it using js or an iframe, which tumblr supports.

Bitcoin is far from a closed loop payment system. You can use bitcoins anywhere at anytime, as long as the receiver wants to accept it. The money doesn't devalue if you don't use them. Bitcoin doesn't really fit into any of these categories. It's in its own category all by itself.

You can't have great privacy with Tor, and be sloppy with the details too. You need to take some self-responsibility that you are using Bookmarks of the correct site, checking for the Lock symbol, and not falling victim to phishing attempts.

I kind of disagree with this. With every post I am seeing people saying use coinbase, or use circle.

that's because bc.i is the most popular bitcoin wallet in the entire bitcoinsphere by far. people don't like to admit it. the same issues plague coinbase, etc. when you have tons of users, a small % will have issues and in a community like you have very vocal users that like to complain even when the fault is of their own.

Great points. The only rebuttal I have is that you can't trust your users. People *will* hold more then they can afford to lose. And when it's stole because the key is made public? They will blame you (I know, their fault!). You as the dev has to put some safeguard in place. Good luck! I love the idea.

I live in the U.S. and am not poverty stricken. For years I was blacklisted on the 'paychex' system which most banks use, because of an error cashing a check a long time ago that bounced. It was a misunderstanding and due to that, I literally could not use banks for years. I had to use check cashing places and money order places, always paying exorbitant fees. It sucked.

That's it. You just explained yourself why someone would want to do a 51% attack. Nobody that is pro-bitcoin would do this. Someone that is purely anti-bitcoin, would be elated to bring the value of bitcoins to nothing. It's not about double spending and making money, it's about destroying bitcoin.
The good thing is, that it would cost whoever wanted to do this, an extra ordinate amount of money. So someone with many millions and millions to build up hashing power might be able to do this.

I'm concerned based off of Ross' sentencing plea letter to the judge, he will commit suicide in prison. It's a possibility, a scary one at that. Will Ross become a martyr for the cause? If he does pass (God forbid, even living in a world of murderers, rapists, pedophiles, etc.), this sentencing will only fuel those that wish to 'stick it to the man' and create a world where places like Silk Road adapt, evolve, and become such a common place and unstoppable that in 10 years this sentencing will sound very illogical and stupid. 
God speed to Ross' family.

Not defending the troll, but just playing devils advocate. 
Normal people like you and I won't know the transaction you made. The concern is government entities abusing their power. So let's say, the government knows who you are through your IP. If they know that, they can see that the transaction generated from you, and then the rest falls into place. Once they know that address belongs to you, they can trace it all in the blockchain.

There are too many possibilities to say with such certainty. Szabo even said it could be Wai Dai. 
**Edit:** also I just wanted to clarify something. Szabo, although very mysterious, I don't think is too hard to find for people with time and money. If you peruse old email archives you can read a lot of posts from Szabo, with tons of personal information about him for those with the time to track him down fairly easily. 
It's also important to note that Szabo has done as much as he could over the years to keep his identity private. People need to respect that. If you go back and read his old emails, you will see even back in the 90's he had people that were borderline stalkers trying to out him because of his opinions; very scary stuff even for back then.

I didn't mean they would hold that amount from start to end of the year. I just meant over the period of a year, they would have to buy that much bitcoin to pay their employees with. It's spread out over a year, and it's a conservative number. It could be more closer to $1m a year in bitcoin purchased to pay staff.

Hey Bash, I tend to agree with inaworldgonecrazy, just giving you a different point of view. It seems a lot of the community here has gotten on bc.i about their name; but the same rules don't apply to Coinbase, BitCore, Bitcoin Wallet (just as an example), or anyone else with similar bitcoin general use terms as names. Also, I don't think bc.i is rebranding, or trying to, they have always gone by "Blockchain". FWIW, the technology is actually "block chain" (lowercase, two words) and not "Blockchain".

Actually Bitpay allows merchants to do chargebacks. Only if someone pays directly with Bitcoin (not using Bitpay), then there are no chargebacks.

I second this. Bitwallet is pretty awesome, better than Breadwallet in my opinion. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 22:08:31
I think with the success of Coinbase many more will come with the same model. Like Circle, which is still yet to be determined as successful, but the same. More "exchanges" that are wallets too, so you can buy, sell, and store your coins and be as convenient as possible.

It actually should be added to the exchanges list instead, even though it's more of a broker like coinbase (but both are basically exchanges to buy/sell). Having a wallet at circle or coinbase is a byproduct of their service only.

Seaman is a bit of a douche I see. Did he actually read the article? Here is one part of the article that says Gavin is confident in bitcoins future. 


And the part that Seaman is crying about:




Clearly he doesn't actually say he is investing in stocks, but diversifying out of Bitcoin. But if you actually read what Gavin said, he is saying the amount of bitcoins he has now is enough for him to live happily; he doesn't wish to be rich and probably avoids it. So he diversifies out so that he won't be rich, because if he doesn't, he will most certainly be filthy rich one day.

That's awesome and a great vote of confidence for bitcoin in general. Overstock.com [employs 1500 people]( Even if only 1% of all staff decide to get paid in bitcoin, this means that Overstock will be forced to keep that much money in bitcoin holdings so they can pay their staff every two weeks (or whatever schedule). 
Just a random number, but if 15 people have an annual salary of $35,000 (this is very conservative), that would mean $525K a year that Overstock would need to buy bitcoin and disperse to those 15 people, or more.

It's not like Overstock is trying to start a business. This is different. If enough people believe in the CEO, and what he says, which is a CEO's job btw to control morale and keep things positive, he could create an environment for more people to get paid in bitcoin.

The q&amp;a should be recorded and published to the conference website for anyone to view and download/share (Creative Commons).

Tricky indeed. I don't think a complete lockout is necessary. I think they would know their own weak points, and need to fix them. Something tells me this case has to do with key logging / malware. Why was everything fine for a "long time" then as soon as he logged in from home he was hacked. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 16:52:55
I agree that Ver's case is a bit more compelling since there was danger there and an off chance that something very bad could have happened. It was a bad decision by him but by no means do I consider him a criminal, scammer, or in general a bad person. 
Shrem's case is bullshit. He sold bitcoins to someone, who then used those coins on SR.

Wow, I've never read the hashing/asics post he made before. But the other bitgold post I've read, which is just fascinating. The similarities between Bitcoin and bitgold are crazy; including the terms he used. 
For example, "proof of work", "distributed", "registry" (open ledger), "unforgeable chain", (blockchain), etc. 
The post dated Dec 2008 (2 months after Bitcoin white paper was officially published) was actually written in Dec 2005. Nobody knows why he changed the date. 
It's also a bit strange that Satoshi never cited Szabo's work, even though it seems heavily influenced by it.

This is true in the total amount of coins in circulation. But you aren't speaking of the emotional response. This could either create a huge surge, because so many could see it as positive that Satoshi is alive and still part of Bitcoin. Or it could be a disaster, as people could see it as a negative that someone has so much ownership of the total amount in circulation.

Bitcoin XT is a patch set on top of Bitcoin Core. It is currently maintained by Mike Hearn in collaboration with Gavin Andresen and Tom Harding. If a patch seems in line with the principles of the project it will be considered for inclusion. If the developer is willing to assist with rebasing work, that also helps build the case for inclusion.
**Decisions are made through agreement between Mike and Gavin, with Mike making the final call if a serious dispute were to arise.** In the event that such a dispute cannot be resolved this way and an XT developer were to make a fork, this website would provide a discussion and link to the competing version.
Edit: more stuff - welcome to a centralized Bitcoin people. 
Decision making is quick and clear. Decisions are made according to a leadership hierarchy. **The XT software encodes decisions that follow the above principles: people who disagree are welcome to use different software**, or patch ours. 
Edit: even more stuff - say goodbye to privacy 
This patch set introduces code that runs when a node is full and otherwise could not accept new connections. **It labels and prioritises connections according to lists of IP ranges: if a high priority IP address connects and the node is full, it will disconnect a lower priority connection to make room. Currently Tor exits are labelled as being lower priority than regular IP addresses, as jamming attacks via Tor have been observed, and most users/merchants don't use it.** 
Just so people know, I'm PRO-bigger blocks! But not by having a centralized coin with a dictator and less privacy. Please do your homework before jumping on the bandwagon. If you want Bitcoin to succeed, then read up and make an informed decision.

Well that means you know nothing of the history then. Back when the MtGox source code was leaked, it showed a clear relationship between Luke's Eligius mining operation and MtGox. Luke even admitted in the past of working with Mark to have freshly minted coins going into Gox to be deposited. The original comment above was were there any people with special working relationships who had direct access to Mark - this is one of them.

Just try to keep it as simple as possible.

No where in the patent do they talk about PoW (that I see, unless someone else notices it), so it's the ever-so-talked-about blockchain without the bitcoin point of view. Where they basically have an open ledger and hashed inputs for security which match to the users profile for viewing the global *centralized* ledger. It basically solves the username/password issue for Citibank, allowing users to view a global ledger of their transactions without having to login.

I can understand the frustration. Anytime there is money to be made, scammers come out in droves. From looking at their website, they sound like a VC investor type of company, an incubator, or maybe consultation too. If I'm paying them for consulting, you better believe that I will research them first, and know if they are giving me good advice or not. If they don't know blockchain tech, it would be obvious to anyone in this field fairly quickly.

I love this because it's so easy to find an immediate value in Bitcoin when you hear about places like Greece, Cyprus, and [many other countries]( and the phrase, "capital controls." The Greek debt crisis is a recent and prime example of why Bitcoin is so powerful. It cannot be seized, controlled, stolen by govt, and so on. And *that* my friends, is *purchasing power*. 
@_date: 2015-07-24 12:29:17


I doubt it. This whole PR stunt is meant to muddy the water. We all know the value transfer in Bitcoin is instant, and confirmations take time. So why not change the wording to "lowest fees" and "fastest transactions" on the market (compared to credit cards, paypal, western union, etc). Why remove entire blocks of info??

Feedback: stop referring sex workers to Coinbase. Although Coinbase is easy to use and understand, it's well known for them to ambitiously shut down user accounts of people using their accounts for grey areas (darknet, drugs, etc).

I'm not sure. We'd need a lawyer to chime in, but if I'm not working for any company and receiving gifts under $50K as a donation, it's not taxable afaik. Again, I could be wrong. 
Edit: also, I'm in the US. It is probably different country by country. And if it's a btc that the recipient gets, how is that taxed? Isn't the recipient not paying taxes until the btc is converted to fiat?

The benefits can go both ways. For smaller orgs, training a few employees how to accept bitcoins at your POS is easy. Companies like BitPay make it easy too; don't make it seem harder than it really is. Accepting Bitcoin in 2015 is much easier than it was just one or two years ago, and presumably if Bitcoin becomes more popular it will be even more easy in the foreseeable future. For bigger orgs you can offset slippage with the savings you incur overtime with your smaller processing fees.

agreed. many people fail to understand this due to a mental roadblock that groups are not decentralized. it's human nature to group with like minded people, and create things together. this is how groups like the foundation started. unfortunately when things go too far removed from a "group" and tried to be something it wasn't (representing all of the bitcoin community as the official foundation) is where things went wrong. there is nothing wrong with people grouping together for the greater benefit of bitcoin.

It's a double edged sword. People want complete freedom to say/do whatever, and not be censored. But if you censor, then the mods are called out for it. 
The only request I would have is when there is someone obviously trolling, being disrespectful, is full of shit and everyone knows it, that account should be banned. The mods like to let it go, but be being nasty and derogatory to others is where I draw the line. 
@_date: 2015-04-03 16:52:38
Doesn't need to be off chain. Can be done with zero confirmations. A good implementation would be to have it in a couple hub stations to test it out as an optional way to pay. If it works and is successful, then you have a viable option to pay removing cash/change from the equation.

Scaring people with posts like this won't work. OTC markets like LocalBitcoins allow for cash only purchases. If you are stupid enough to buy and sell using your bank account and aren't filing taxes, then yes this would apply to you. Also, if you are buying but never converting back to fiat there is no realized gain (or loss) to even file.

I don't think it's necessary, but if they've been hit with a lot of double spend attacks I can see the logic. 
Edit; just thinking about this more. I wonder if customers in 'good standing' (obviously subjective to Gyfts judgment) don't have to wait for 1 confirmation. Confirmations should be geared more toward new users, who maybe haven't built trust yet with Gyft.

This is kind of off topic, but since you're lending your services - what do you think about GA reports that show a lot of these junk referral sites? I read recently that these spam sites are manipulating the javascript GA uses that web masters embed on their site somehow. Is there any way to stop these types of spam sites showing up in GA?

Edit: found it, I read this post a couple months ago that explains it. It seems there is no resolution to it? How does Google not fix this??

*In addition, the government’s introduction of this issue – the Silk Road web site’s alleged responsibility for certain deaths, whether or not from substances purchased from vendors on the Silk Road site2 – makes highly relevant a related issue: the extent to which the Silk Road web site reduced the dangers of substance abuse, and consciously and deliberately incorporated “harm reduction” strategies to implement that objective.*

Yes it is, you said it yourself. And yes confirmations do matter, but making someone wait 10 mins for one confirmation when I'm sure that person will be busy with other things is a bit silly. There is no point to wait for one confirmation in this type of situation. I bet John Doe won't be able to try to be double-spending when he is busy doing other things.

Bitpay provides the option to the merchant, to accept zero confirmations or 1,2,3, etc.

Yeah, i think that is the point. Don't use them then so they aren't broadcasted to the network. You could use bitaddress.org for example to generate random passwords and "watch" them in a wallet (and never use them).

Bitcoin = money (digital money)
Money is held in a wallet, or for bitcoins, a digital wallet. There are lots of wallet services out there, and people will probably give you examples. But the point is, once you have a wallet, you can create a Bitcoin "public address" where people can send you money (bitcoins) to. 
To make it easier, most wallets support QR code scanning. So you hold your wallet address QR code image out, and someone can scan and pay money to it. 
Bitcoin is not fully anonymous, but it's more anonymous than credit cards and paypal. 
Edit: I just wanted to add that sending and receiving bitcoins is instant, and a plus for your line of work because bitcoin payments are non-reversible.

Yeah, there are a bunch but some good ones that are recommended are Mycelium wallet, BreadWallet, and Blockchain.info wallet. I would recommend you keeping only so much on these "mobile" type of wallets, and then downloading a bitcoin client (software program) to your local computer at home. Then you can transfer any "mobile" coins at the end the day/week/whatever to your home bitcoin client/wallet for safer keeping, as you don't want to carry around so many coins. Some good bitcoin client programs are Electrum, Armory, Multibit, and of course Bitcoin Core Wallet.

Yeah, it could be he obtained ownership after the first registrar. Also, the official white paper came out Oct31, 2008, but Satoshi is known to have sent around the white paper months before to get opinions. He also said himself he'd been working on Bitcoin for a couple years before the white paper.

Hey chocobo, I don't think they were saying specifically that it was Coinbase. They said that Sendgrid went back on their statement to say that other systems were also compromised which had customer emails, usernames and passwords. These could be for other companies, not Coinbase. Unfortunately the article doesn't clearly say whether it was your data or another companies that was on those systems.

You can't really blame OP for listing wallets like Coinbase and Circle. Sure they blur the lines but they are a "wallet." But if you want a "true" wallet then you won't use one that has control over your private key. 
@_date: 2015-04-13 01:07:10

I highly doubt this, but some could be possible. Do you have any sources or anything to cite this? I'd just like to read more about that. 
You have to be careful, so yes you can't be lazy about it. Also, I'm not sure what you mean by deposit receipt scan or bank surveillance.
If I buy direct with cash from a seller, there is no deposit or bank surveillance.

The reason coinbase does that is because they are an exchange/broker too. Basically any bitcoin wallet that isn't also an exchange should be fine.

I don't think Bitwallet uses a passphrase, but users can get their private keys. So if OP saved it, he can sweep it to another wallet. If he didn't, I don't think Bitwallet keeps copies of it.

In the footer of the main page you can add a Bitcoin button saying Bitcoin accepted. You can add it subtly so it looks nice and non-obtrusive.

Hate is a strong word, but for those that lost coins at Gox, they are upset rightfully so. 
Despite all the recent news, it doesn't explain the **after math**. Karpeles' actions after the seizure in 2013 may have led to Gox running a fractional reserve. At that point in time Karpeles made a decision to continue going, playing a risky game he lost and later blamed Bitcoin for with tx malleability.

It's an idea I floated around some years ago to a couple blogging platforms, but they all said no. But basically, you incentivize bloggers to blog on your platform by sharing ad revenue. It shouldn't be too hard to share ad stats with bloggers/users, and they get a flat % of that revenue.

In the big scheme of things this is a blip on the radar. Bitcoin evolution (no pun intended, well, okay maybe a little) takes time, and in a couple years this event won't make a whole lot of difference toward the overall price and adoption.

Agreed but I checked the LV Clark county court records and Bryan Micon only has some traffic violations [1], nothing criminal. In his video he says there is no criminal charge, so it won't show publicly (?). I'm not sure where else to look or find a search warrant to be issued. 
I also checked the LV Gaming Board public complaints and there is nothing there about Micon or SWC [2]

Yup, I agree with op. I got 12 black coins yesterday and was able to test the xapo process. I was never able to send the coins out of the xapo address because they require verification.  It's nothing wrong with your app, but it's their process that is the problem.

Except that one with Garza and Moe....

He's talking about Ryan Charles' recent work writing bitcoin in javascript.

Why don't you also post the process to activate so people know how? 
Edit: some additional info 
@_date: 2015-02-20 02:43:46
How about an authenticator or PIN code?
@_date: 2015-03-25 13:21:18
that's a bad analogy. it's more like...
you open a safe deposit box at a bank, and put your valuables in it. after a year of not going to the bank and using it, the bank decides to open it and move it to their vault for safer keeping. you then don't find out until you go back to the bank later, to find out, they moved it from one part of their bank to another for "your own good." To make matters worse, you can't get your valuables at all, until they give you access to it.

What about cash then? How did illegal market places work prior to 2009? You don't say, hey cash means it's always used for illegal drugs. Bitcoin is more than that.

Number 7 doesn't make sense...


Why were they a company that you were proud of before, but aren't proud of now? Their name hasn't changed, it's always been Blockchain.info. 
@_date: 2015-03-17 00:45:24
I saw that, was close :)
@_date: 2015-02-09 00:43:40
And do I have to register with xapo to collect the bits? Before I just input my Bitcoin address and the bits were sent there automatically. It couldn't have been easier. 
**edit**: I just got 12 black coins in the game and was sent some bits. I went and setup a xapo account, but I **can not send any bitcoins out unless I verify my identity**. Sorry but this is a shitty change. I'm deleting the game now. 
@_date: 2015-03-11 18:30:03
well, i know that some sites take an *ethical* stance towards this, writing about it, but also buying/getting paid in it, can cause some conflict. 
@_date: 2015-03-16 21:02:03
I think a lot of people just shorten the names for convenience. It's too bad everyone picks on Blockchain.info though when many Bitcoin-related services have Bitcoin-related names. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 01:35:14

This is only the beginning. We are part of something special. We are all pioneers in a new era, and in 20 years when it's common place and the block chain is the backbone of all major apps and structures, we will all look back and smile.

Can users create their own addresses yet? That's the only thing stopping me from using this app. Instead I'm using BitWallet for now and Blockchain.info

I saw the same thing. They need to remove or replace that link. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 17:17:35
The same as it does for men. 
@_date: 2015-02-06 18:01:30
Nobody said they had to. Obviously with little competition they feel entitled to over charge. I'm hoping Bitcoin will change this, either by replacing them or giving enough competition to lower their prices.

He never owned it. He leased it from the owner at that time. Just like how Blockchain.info and OkCoin have done.

Interesting. I haven't followed the Mycoin news that close, but I have seen many news reports posted about it already. I don't have any more info on bitdrop than what was reported, but I did read that they will try again but at another location outside of Dominica. 
@_date: 2015-02-17 02:18:22
Although it's hard to believe, if I were to do the same, I would also use a throwaway account. I don't think we should immediately discount the post, but at the same time, take it with a bag of salt. 
@_date: 2015-02-19 03:11:50
Actually you can't. It has to be a registered 501c3 with the IRS. Seans Outpost isn't registered.

I think tips are a great way to show appreciation especially over the Internet. I personally just don't like if someone tries to shove a 75% tip on top of something they are already getting paid to do.

If you want to be technical, it's actually called "block chain" (two words). And I use their wallet which is way more robust than a lot of other wallets out there.

this is very impressive. i signed up and it's really cool. you def need an about page on the public side that shows the benefits of logging in, and account security. the UX is fine.

Might be good to ask for donations once the tape is published, not before for a meeting that *we* aren't invited to. Also, not sure if you are able to answer or not, but why is a journo from AlJazeera going? Is the intent to report the event? 
@_date: 2015-02-05 03:59:31
I don't think a lack of expertise to track the blockchain is the same as not caring. Bitstamp should still be accountable to their customers of what happened.
