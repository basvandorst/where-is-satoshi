Nope, that's because BTC has a blocksize limit of 1mb, which was never supposed to be reached and should have been adjusted or removed a long time ago.

It will take  eight time as much transactions obviously, which buys time for the next scaling solution

Lightning Network runs as a second layer solution on top of the blockchain and has plenty security issues which might be solved within the next 18 months, in the meantime use low transaction fee altcoins OR.....
TABS(TM) are invented by Adam Back as a one stop solution for all your payments. Ask your local shops to ask your local Bitcoin developer to create some sort of app to keep track of it all and you are ready to go.

What is wrong with pushing it back a bit while we wait for 2nd layer solutions?
The worst thing that could happen is btc gets more adaption. Scaling is not some one size fits all solution but should happen while the network and adaption keeps growing.
Imagine you are a shop owner, your shop is so full all the time you are missing out on sales, wouldn't you resize your shop to twice the size because it might get full again?

Oh man, this sub is so pathetic, no intelligence to be found, just an echo chamber of plain false and twisted facts.

Kids don't give a shit about money. They just make fun and learn stuff along the way. Not a single cup would be sold less because of wrong spelling on a children made sign. They would just think you are a nagging old grown up trying to spoil the fun

Quickly make the same meme for 7000 and post it again when it breaks 7000. This sub needs more memes.
What would happen if people get bored and start asking questions.

Which flaws and schoolboy errors you mean?

How the hell is BTS a BTC knockoff?? BTS is a blockchain working as a decentralised exhange, very cool and definitly not just some BTC knockoff like the other two coins delisted.

Yes, makes you wonder what all the fuss is about, a digital currency that will take a day to confirm unless you pay crazy fees from time to time.
Also sounds different from what i read in the whitepaper, but maybe it is just growing pains.

I think it was Bitcoin Cash, why dissapointment about that? It is the closest to Bitcoin and totally fits the use case, with it's big blocks and low fees.
Nobody wants the big fees and high security from a settlement chain for small transactions on a platform like openbazaar.

Dogecoin?? It is a joke, literally, it has no dev team and is constrained by the same blocksize limitations as btc.
@_date: 2019-04-07 05:41:37
There was a lot of fud because they use not only bitcoin (because it's a settlement layer and not cash) but also other crypto's.
Just check their website.

Lol, segwit is no way a blocksize increase, yes more transactions will fit a block, when someone will actually use it (nobody does).
But the blocksize is still 1MB. I believe in Bitcoin technology, not in LN since it will be centralised, i do not understand why we have to wait around for years to fix this. Just increase the blocksize limit until someone comes up with a better scaling solution.
Just like it was meant to by Satoshi in the whitepaper.

Do you think when the dollar will be crashing, it would be legal to trade dollars for other currencies?
I don't think so, every country would do it, it is just so important to them.
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:38:51
I see a block that is 6 KB bigger than 1mb, let me refrase, the actual usable blocksize with almost nobody using segwit is still somewhere around 1mb.
Every LN hub is a centralised entity that could require kyc from their users or could be taken down by the government.
It is just like banks, which we were trying to get rid of, right?
@_date: 2018-07-16 05:54:43
The blocksize is just 1mb but without the witness data more transactions can be stored.
Blocks are not bigger in mb's but are in transactions they fit.
