May I ask whether I’d receive coins of bitcoin forks that doesn’t support segwit if my coins are in a segwit address?

Why isn't it the right moment? Potential forks? Or the price being high? Thank you :)

Under what pretext though?

Finally a well-written article for laymen like me! I don't really want to believe in anyone blindly, but I simply can't understand most videos and articles out there.

Sorry for my poor English, I'm referring to no longer using bitcoin for purchases. ��

Chinese media are well censored, especially for people.com.cn, so the state's stance should not deviate much.

I'm an ethnic Chinese. I hope the officials have made the decision, they're VERY indecisive.

TLDR: 
First part: Explain what ICO is and how risky it is, explaining why ICO is banned in China.
Second part: differentiating ICO and cryptos, saying Bitcoin can't be banned due to its decentralised nature, and saying regulating exchanges is the right way to go. 
Third part: saying bitcoin does not represent the whole blockchain and saying blockchain technology is interesting.
