Not sure why you got downvoted...
You are correct - you have to track all those transactions AND since it is considered a stock, you may take losses (according to a tax expert on NPR news). Also, unfortunately, you are day trading and thus responsible for short term gain taxes (less than 1 year which will tax you at a rate from 10% to 39% depending on your existing income).

That's correct - a tax expert on NPR stated that coins will have to be tracked to determine the realized gain between it's mined or bought price and it's sale price (same as stock).
Example: I bought 1 bitcoin in 2011 for 7$ and sold it in 2013 for $1,000. My gain is $993 and thus I would have to pay a tax of 15% since it is long term as I held on to it for over a year. Thus $993 x .15 = $148.95 in taxes
Businesses would be unaffected by tax as they sell bitcoin immediately upon receipt to customers unless they didn't already have an agreement in place with companies such as coinbase.
Overall though - I think this legitimizes Bitcoin.
Tax experts: Please correct me if I am wrong but this is how I process stock sales.

It should be and makes sense that it is a like-kind value; exchanging bitcoin for litecoin would be the same value (since bots keep arbitrage differences extremely tight between the alternate coins and bitcoin). But as keogh pointed out;
"Six types of property are not eligible for a like-kind exchange: (1) stock in trade or other property held primarily for sale; (2) stocks, bonds, or notes; (3) other securities or evidences of indebtedness or interest; (4) interests in a partnership; (5) certificates of trust or beneficial interests; and (6) choses in action."

False, read the entire report. Read the entire story - when people in his organization wanted out Ross hired a hitman to carry out an execution. A second associate wanted out, and another contract was ordered in which he argues over the price of the contract in an email. Silk Road sellers sold everything, and if you agree with Heroin and other narcotics being sold this way, including mercenaries and hitman-for-hire, then buy a t-shirt.

|What does Bitcoin do to preserve itself once the rewards become insubstantial? Or disappear entirely?|
It simply exists, but it is still intangible. If the ledger says you have 1 bitcoin and all agree, then it is part of the network. So once all 21 million coins are mined the ledger will simply exist for transactions: people will use it as money and it's value wholly depends on supply and demand. Obviously, mining bitcoin will cease but there are many other crypto currencies and they will likely focus on them or create new ones - anyone remember the doc sheets of new coins coming out every day and the hype - re dogecoin had some serious backing. There were SO many scams going on then too - new coin released and they'd want 1 bitcoin for every new coin they created and suckers bought in and watched as they dwindled quickly as those particular miners made fortunes but other coin devs began exposing them - the scammers even had the first transaction generate 1 million coins to them with a 50 coin payout thereafter so that they could dump on the unsuspecting. Then there were the ASIC scams. Essentially, you had a choice: try and buy as many ASICs as you could afford and then mine hoping to not only make a return but make a profit. Just like the 1848 Gold Rush in California, the first ones to discover made massive profits. By the time the word reached around the world, all the easy surface gold in rivers and in valleys were gone by the time the hundreds of thousands of people arrived within a few short years. So few gold miners actually made anything, only the suppliers (pickaxe, shovel makers) and whores became millionaires, and the process repeated itself. Many that bought bitcoin gear waited so long for the ASICs to come out that they had no choice but to sell it to a larger pool of investors and took a lose. The other option was to buy and hold as day traders were burned by scheduled pump and dumps. It was interesting to watch because there was no oversight, no Security Exchange Commisions. Sorry - this went a little longer than expected.
So to answer your question the ledger will continue, the value will depend on supply and demand and what governments do to fiat, the stock market, bonds, etc.

Looking at the log, OP mined Bitcoin back in 2009 and if I recall, the first bitcoins were mined in January of that year. Essentially, at the early stages of mining the algorithm is so low even laptops could mine 50 coins per every 2 minutes. 
So you are right, mining bitcoin is exponentially harder now and it takes serious computing power (pools of users) to combine and win a shot at 25 bitcoins which are then shared. However, the beauty of bitcoin is that the bitcoin algorithm scales to computing power. Bitcoin will not collapse however, the limit of 21 million will be reached way into the future as the reward continues to halve.

I made a large post above answering this but essentially when bitcoin first came out it was like "what is 2 + 2 = ?" so even a laptop could mine 50 bitcoins every 2 minutes. As the hash became harder and harder to solve, desktops with gaming cards beat out the cheaper computers and eventually ASIC computers beat out gaming computers. Pools were created where you could join and have hundreds of CPUs and even ASICs be the first to hash the next 50 bitcoins. The pools dominated, and even those with Jupiter and Saturn ASICs who went solo were left in the dust. Now it's massive pools versus massive pools and computer rooms built next to dams generating almost free power. Early adopters really benefitted followed by those who purchased rather than mined.

Investors went out of FIAT over concerns with US President election and the talk of NAFTA challenges and other trade agreements which had a global effect. In the near future (despite a few spikes), big investors are moving out of bitcoin and into fiat again.

Once the last coin is mined then it can no longer be forked, only spent (moved from blockchain wallet to blockchain wallet with the ledger confirming that the transaction is legitimate). Miners will switch to another coin. This is what I understand from the dev team way back.
As for the future of Bitcoin - unknown by anyone period. There are so many possibilities - public interest (major interest due to fiat instability or frustration with volatility), a major flaw discovered which kills it, network disruption (war or otherwise), hard forks. All these things may affect how Bitcoin survives but it does have a good foundation. If you are asking me what I think:
1) Follow the financial expert advice of "not all eggs in one basket" and invest in it during the dips. Go long on it as part of your portfolio.
2) Avoid day trading on it - I have seen whales destroy other whales.
3) For small fish, mining wasn't worth it after 2011, those that invested did very well by not listening to chat boxes (btc-e) and were patient.

I went to your site, why are you mining namecoin?
Also, you just ordered BFL - they just shipped a good portion of Jalepenos and only a few ASIC 60s from orders 1 year ago. The ROI is simply not there due to the timeline of build and ship dates, especially with since the bitcoin network went from 4 THashes to 90 in just 30 days, making a single Jalepeno 5 G/hasher a big disappointment. People are still quoting $300 a day with the 60 G/Hasher, but they are basing it off older data. To compete, you need about 30 Single ASICs or more.
Oddly enough, I believe you are the real deal though, but you won't be able to deliver those promised dividends through no fault of your own.

You are comparing what the majority were thinking after 9/11 to today (if we are talking about Afghanistan). People were angry, enraged, and the people, the media, and finally Congress went ahead of the plan. You all know this to be true - how many came on reddit claiming "I was one of the few people who didn't agree with going to war..."
Of course, revisionist come here, like you, claiming that 8-30 million is equivalent to the majority.
Finally, enough people opposed Word War 2 until war came to the USA. Imagine the millions of lives we could have saved if Hitler was stopped in Munich.

Are toys regulated? How about old toys worth thousands? How about antiques?
Bitcoin is much the same. There is either a demand or no demand for an item, the rarity of the item may or may not matter. I have seen unique (only one in existance) items sell for pennies as there was no interest in them.

I understand proportions - you didn't make a strong case at all as over 1.5 BILLION in USD cash is used per month for illegal contraband and illicit activity.
It's comments like these that make you want to bang your head against the wall - read the white paper on bitcoin, the author specifically stated the purpose of bitcoin. Apparently, you are the only one surprised that the underground market later adopted the use of bitcoin for transactions and this was an after-effect of it's use.
So if Bitcoin didn't exist, what would change? If your numbers are correct, you *are* aware that the 1.2 million would be processed in fiat, right? Perhaps you should focus your attention on the fiat problems first and then come and complain about the very small fractional use of bitcoin for illegal use.

What are your thoughts on Computerworld's article that; "IDG News Service - Security researchers from Kaspersky Lab have identified a spam message campaign on Skype that spreads a piece of malware with Bitcoin mining capabilities."
"Cybercriminals have figured out that distributed Bitcoin mining is a perfect task for botnets and have started developing malware that can abuse the CPUs and GPUs of infected computers to generate Bitcoins."
"Visiting the rogue URL prompts users to download a file called skype-img-04_04-2013.exe that's a malware installer with a low antivirus detection rate, he said.
According to Bestuzhev, the average click rate for the rogue URL is high, at over 2,000 clicks per hour. "Most of potential victims live in Italy then Russia, Poland, Costa Rica, Spain, Germany, Ukraine and others," he said."

The war itself is not compared, merely the cause of it. You have to admit, Saddam worked very hard to get the third off by launching scuds at Israel, or are you too young to remember?
It will take a number of decades, but one day people will realize that Bush was correct. We have sustained life this long without ending it all, and we are likely experiencing the best of times despite the extremism out there.
This horse has been beat enough, and it seems we disagree.
