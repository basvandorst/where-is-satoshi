Probably why if you are a US citizen its a good idea not to use a US based exchange. Good luck to the IRS trying to get a Chinese exchange to hand over their customer records.

Stupid question but...why? Is it out of fear that the person will rob you or hold you hostage? Bitcoins seem quite a difficult thing to steal, for the average criminally minded person.

Is there a place I can go to hold hands with other hodlers?

@_date: 2019-07-11 21:33:25
Real question is when is the next dip / crash gonna be ?

I guess im just wondering what peoples thinking is, I 100% agree it makes complete sense to not go around advertising it, but some people are REALLY "opsec" about it, like don't mention it even to close family. I was wondering why, what makes them so distrustful - do they think someone is gonna rob them or kidnap a family member and ransom them for BTC?
I got a friend into BTC and hes asked me to handle his coins which are stored as his daughters inheritance if anything should happen to him.

UNGA BUNGA ME BUY MORE COIN

I'd say the prevailing sentiment is people want bitcoin to go on sale again so they can buy more.

Fucking useless shitcoins, they should be represented as pushing bitcoin over instead of sitting idly by doing nothing.

How about they fuck off, I already pay 45%.
Go and collect tax from the mega rich and multinat corporations who pay between 0 and 5% maximum.

Sounds like a ponzi scheme, similar to "Airbit club" which is big in phillipines. 
Say there are 100 of you all giving this woman 0.03 bitcoin, she uses the bulk of the people to fund the 0.15 bitcoin return to a select few. 
The scam usually works because people are greedy, so they re-invest that 0.15 bitcoin with them thinking they will get 0.75 bitcoin back in a few months.
With enough people this just builds and builds, until eventually too many people want to cash out "their" bitcoin that do not actually exist, and the whole thing collapses.
All is not lost - try to cash out your 0.15 bitcoin but imply you will DEFINETELY re-invest it with her if you get paid out this fantastic rate of return. Insist that you be paid out first before you re-invest, but that you will definitely re-invest and likely far higher amounts. 
Use her own greed against her, then run like the wind once you have your 0.15 coins.

We all made a mistake not buying in at $10. Even those that did made a mistake not buying in more than they did. 
The important thing is did we learn from that mistake.

I remember buying some Dash after reading the dash subreddit about how amazing it was.
Might as well have thrown some money into a wishing well, would have made more out of it.

All lies and nonsense. 
Your best bet is to leverage her own greed against her, by mentioning that you own far more bitcoin and would be willing to invest it with her. Keep bringing it up, and see if you can hook her in - she may decide to offer you something in an attempt to real you in.

Yep, the average pleb isn't allowed to save and make money doing so - that is only for the ultra rich who have their wealth invested in stocks etc and expect a continuous 10% per annum growth, so if there is any sign of no economic growth we all have to shit our pants that the world is ending and make sure we spend spend spend to keep things going.
