Yeah, that's kinda a pipe dream right now. I fully expect Crypto to eventually become the dominant means of accounting, but I don't expect it to see 100% of the day-to-day action; at least, not Bitcoin.
Especially the fantasy that we're going to wipe out the Fed. IF the Fed ever had even the slightest inkling that Bitcoin was going to offer true competition against the US Dollar, it would buy up Bitcoin in unimaginable amounts. 
Then it would do exactly what it does with USD and control inflation via a stockpile.

The connection wasn't, thanks to the phrasing. But I get your point. Honestly, you do control your device. The OS itself isn't what's vulnerable, it's the applications you install on top of that. And if you feel that the OS is, go rewrite it, there's no one stopping you.

Again, what the hell are you doing here? Let the buyer beware.
Regulation belongs at the state level; I agree that *some* is necessary, but the amount we have nowadays, especially at the **Federal** level is overbearing. If you genuinely look at the economic trends since the 80s, you can see the ridiculous amount of good that deregulation has done for our economy; the Invisible Hand of the Free Market works just fine at keeping corporations in-line. 
Regulation is only necessary when facing the "Tragedy of the Commons", and even then, should be handled locally, so as to avoid issues with bloated bureaucracy and one-size-fits-all. Who do you think is paying for all the "regulation" in our Federal Government? How do you reconcile that with your concern about the national debt?

Really? Someone wants to regulate finance **more** and you thought they were a Republican? 
Damn dude, it's like you just haven't been paying attention for the past 80 years

What are you even doing in this subreddit? How are you even involved with Bitcoin? 
I agree that the national debt is bad, but deregulation is the cure to many of societies problems; thanks to the Left, we've become stuck in this horrid little middle-ground where deregulation only empowers the biggest corporations with government-sponsored monopolies. 
For example, look at what a mess the streaming market is and tell me that our IP law isn't horribly broken.
