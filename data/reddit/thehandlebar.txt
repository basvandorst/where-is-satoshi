I hope 1 satoshi would be the smallest denomination we are all willing to accept. Currently in the USA, that would be .01 cent. There's nothing that can be done with a penny anymore, so perhaps maybe 1 satoshi should equal 5 or 10 cents USD.  No need for it to be larger. This is assuming that you cant divide a satoshi into smaller parts, therefore, it should equivalent to the smallest fiat denomination acceptable.

You can always buy USDC  on Coinbase ($0 fee), move to Coinbase Pro ($0 Fee) and purchase your BTC there (very small fee). Then transfer to your preferred wallet ($0 Coinbase fee, just pay mining). You can do all this same day, no waiting with proper verification.
EDIT* There is no fee at all moving your coins from Coinbase Pro to your desired wallet.

It’s not USD, it’s USDC which is zero fee and same day.

USDC = USD Coin on Coinbase. It’s their stablecoin pegged to the US Dollar.

Sorry, not Mining fee. 
Also I know everywhere it says I shouldn’t be able to this process in one day, but I do this every week-  including sending it to my ledger.
I buy USDC on Coinbase with my bank account, send to pro immediately after, place a buy order and have it filled, and send to my ledger.  I’ve done this whole process in less than 15 mins from start to finish and a $30 bitcoin purchase costs only about .04 cents in fees total.

Shouldn't the goal really be 1 sat= $.01 usd, since sats cant be split smaller?

Sorry for the confusion. When the the customer is also using BitPay, they scan the QR code and get to confirm the amount being charged.  They don't have to type in the amount they're sending first, that's done by the merchant on the merchant's terminal.
