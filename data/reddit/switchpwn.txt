15, have been using it for a year.

This was what the exchange industry needed. Multisig customer wallets. Good work Bitstamp!

I mean private balance addresses. Balances that is hold on a temporary wallet should be managed both by BitGo and Bitstamp as it will make it harder to hack, but for private balance addresses, 2-2 Bitstamp and user signature would be better.

It is a 2-3 address.
2 is required, but I believe Bitstamp is signing 3.
Let's say, either Bitstamp hold an encrypted private key of user balance address or the user provides bitstamp with a pubkey.
Bitstamp creates a raw transaction, signs it with own private key, then the user has to type the password of the encrypted private key or manually sign the raw transaction and submit that for the transaction to go thorugh.
What I don't understand here if it is a 2-3 address, and BitGo is co-signing, then it is still unsecure as an employee or a hacker can get hold of the bitstamp private key because it only needs 2 keys. But if BitGo gets out of the way and only provides multisig service, and Bitstamp private key and customer private key/signed transaction is required for the transaction to be broadcasted, then we can say it is rock solid and hack proof(99.99%).
PS: There is nothing to do if the users computer has a keylogger.

Oh, yes. That may also be the case. Only BitGo and customer. That would be really good too.
@_date: 2015-01-09 20:59:07
Bitstamp and the user I hope. And BitGo of course, and that's something I really think is bad. It should be a 2-2 address and Bitstamp and user signature should be required.

If BitGo doesn't sign the transaction and Bitstamp signs first with their own private key and either an encrypted user private key or gets provided with a signed raw transaction and the address is a 2-3 address, then even if a hacker gets hands on a bitstamp machine, it will require them to get their hands on all of the users computers too, to get the bitcoins out of Bitstamp and customer control. But if Bitstamp and BitGo gets compromised so can the coins be stolen. So my recommendation is that BitGo should stop co-signing and only Bitstamp and user signature should be required. That makes it really secure and hack proof.

BitGo is 2-3 signing. So I guess Bitstamp holds 1 key and it has to go through BitGo for the funds to be sent.

You should not allow every ip to access it.
Rather the ips you will access the rpc from or local only

Yeah I also had something like 0.02 BTC (just some random amount) but BTC was pending for a good day and I canceled the withdraw to request a DASH withdrawal which is still pending.

Not using it to do anything malicious. Wont do anything to me, I am glad I can buy bitcoins easier now

Thank you for understanding! I play legit, but have a jailbroken iphone and cant play now. Hope this issue gets sorted out!
