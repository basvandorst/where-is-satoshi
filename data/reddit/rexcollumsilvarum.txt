This article is terrifying and its author could be a Bank of Japan flunky given the way he writes.  
As a resident of Japan and as a diligent saver, I am looking forward to the end of the Abe administration and its unceasing efforts to destroy the middle class with inflation.  They seem to have the entire world's media in their pockets, too.

Banks unilaterally change the terms all the time and obtain "agreement" by saying that if you don't object to the changes, you've accepted them.
I'm betting that Wells Fargo's terms have changed significantly since 1997 or whever OP created the account, which is when an agreement is a real agreement.

For me it costs 0.0008 BTC per transfer.

That's a hilarious story, but this part always bugs me:


You don't need inflation as an incentive to invest your money: profits in hard money are just as much of an incentive.
And the 1800s and early 1900s, an era which offered the greatest improvements in quality of life in the first world, was almost entirely gold-backed.

It costs me money to get my coins off an exchange.  My confidence that my exchange (Bitflyer, if you're interested) will survive is high enough that I'm not willing to pay a fee just to hold my own coins.
(I did learn how to set up my own KeepKey, and moved a small amount there just as part of the learning process, but most of my coin is on my exchange so that I can trade it easily.)

That was $10.00 back when I tried it! ;_;
Still, I only own about 0.1 BTC.  It's a pretty big percentage and my exchange has never had a problem.  I also trade between BTC, ETH, and LTC for small profits, which I could not do if the coins were in a cold wallet.

In the very-long run it is because eventually all 21 million bitcoins will be mined and the supply will never increase.  
Now it is technically inflationary because the supply is increasing, but is already "deflationary" in the sense that the number of people using Bitcoin, and the size of the economy that uses Bitcoin, is increasing faster than the supply is, so prices denominated in Bitcoin are coming down.  The speculative nature of investing in Bitcoin means that in a bull market those prices can come down even faster than that,

This is the part that is a disaster for savers and the working class -- the central bank just conduxts QE such that the disaster occurs later than it normally would, which incidentally and conveniently means that the politicians who instigated it don't have to answer for the problems they cause.

All the time, because people who have dollars can get more and better goods for those dollars?

Thanks for this!  I just got a KeepKey a month ago and am still learning how to use it.  (I moved 0.01 BTC into it as a test.)
People are criticizing it but so far I've been OK. Always looking to learn more!

That is straight-up theft, and the sneaky government/central-bank policies (targeted inflation at 0 to 2%, interest is less than the inflation rate, tax presupposes a return far above the interest rate) all work together to destroy savers in a way I hadn't even imagined before.
In Japan, where I live, institutions like banks and brokers take a flat 20% tax from any interest or dividend before you even see it.  No chance of cheating, and it's totally fair, at least compared to a system that *assumes* that people's wealth generates a return that their own policies make sure it doesn't generate, at least if your money is in a bank.
Can you split your bank accounts into sub-40,000 chunks so that they're not subject to it, or does the government pool all your accounts together?

If we get back to $20k I will be very happy.

It *is* his goal.  Japan has seen a huge widening in the wealth gap between the top 5~10% and everyone else since Abe retook power in late 2012.  He and his blueblood cronies don't care about the bottom 90% at all.

This only happens *because* the US dollar is inflationary.  If the dollar maintained its value over the decades, people wouldn't have as much of a motivation to get their money into even mildly deflationary currencies like Bitcoin, and thus Bitcoin wouldn't have soared in value like it has.
Look at gold immediately after the US closed the gold window.  It skyrocketed in value as inflation destroyed the dollar, and then settled down when inflation slowed in the late '90s.  If there were zero inflation in the US dollar -- that is, it were a medium of exchange that kept its value -- we would see BTC's true value as an alternate medium of exchange.

Over the *years* they are coming down as the value of the bitcoin appreciates against fiat.  Now we are in an exceptional bear market, but the vast majority of the time, 1 BTC has been worth more USD than it was a year ago.

Even if you have debt, inflation still works against you.  The interest you pay on your debt would be that much lower if there were no inflation.
@_date: 2018-03-05 14:26:39
The bottom just a month ago was much lower than that.  Ask me how I know this. :)
(Panic-sold 0.1 BTC at 633,000 yen, which was about $5800.  If I had just not been paying attention for those few hours, I would have been spared this loss.)
@_date: 2018-11-28 14:01:31
Not to nitpick, but today 21 BTC is about $80,000, a fabulously wealthy salary.  This dip isn't *that* huge -- though if it falls to the levels people think it will, 21 BTC might be what a typical salary looks like.

Do banks actually pay that much interest on savings accounts?  I have much more than 40,000 euro in the bank and where I live it earns about 0.01% per year.  For people who are saving lots of cash in order to buy their first home, that's really terrifying.

Not a surprise; the current prime minister and his henchman at the Bank of Japan have taken a stable currency and actively and aggressively debased it so as to ruin millions of diligent workers and force them to either put their money at risk or lose their savings.  Every day in the Japanese media we hear lying pronouncements from these two fraudsters about how rising prices at the supermarket (and smaller portion sizes) will magically lead to prosperity.  The very sensible Japanese public knows when they're being scammed, and are hedging by putting some of their savings in something that isn't designed to steal from them.

As somebody who made well under $2k in profit last year (and whose own job pays less than one-tenth what this attorney earns per hour), this is terrifying.  The "consult a tax attorney" shouters seem to forget just how expensive said attorney is.
@_date: 2018-02-28 13:25:10


Average Joes can have transactions way over $20k even if they only have a few thousand dollars invested (like I do).  When you buy and sell very frequently, the transaction total will go way up but you never actually have investments that high.  I have over $8000 in buy orders and $7000 in sell orders last year, and I never had more than $2000 in assets at any time.  And $2000 is, what, a few hours of an attorney's time?  People like me can't afford attorneys.

This was the original definition of Gen Y (born in mid '70s to late '80s) which was used in the '90s, until later when people started using it as a synonym for "Millennial".  I am in this generation too, and feel lucky to have been able to experience a pre-Internet world while still being able to acquire tech knowledge while still young.
We have everything stacked against us demographically -- paying out huge sums to the baby boomers' retirement, and will still be working when they die, while the '90s-births will benefit from not having to pay into the system as much when the boomers are gone.  The government has every incentive to inflate away the dollar (and euro, and yen...) to destroy our savings in order to pay for them.  We need crypto more than our predecessors did, that's for sure.
@_date: 2018-02-09 19:15:34


Careful; it's now 2018 and a 40-year-old was born in 1977 or '78 and could be called a millennial depending on how you measure.  Even a 45-year-old, born in the early '70s, probably had a lot more student debt than the Boomers had and a much tougher time in the job market.  We're at the point where it's really only the 60+ folks who have all the money and had cushy lives from the beginning.  There are a lot more of us than there are of them now, and we need to vote our interests!

This is correct, and ridiculous: if you deposit $1000 and buy and sell a little at a time all year long, you will have well over $20k in buys and $20k in sells, even though you were just trading the "same" money back and forth.
It actually punishes people who hedge against big price swings by playing a buy order and then laddered sell orders up to a high price point, and the converse for sell orders.

My average acquisition price is 12k.  Not because I FOMOed in, but because when I got into bitcoin in September 2017, I prudently (by typical definitions of "prudent") decided to put one-tenth of my investment in each month for the next ten months.  Ended up buying in at super-high prices only to see it crash as soon as my DCAing ended.
I put a bit more money in at 3-4k but am still well into the red even now.  I might sell off a bit if BTC hits 13k or so.
