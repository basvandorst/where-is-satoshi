Woah, this is amazing. For some reason I had thought that colored coins couldn't be moved via payment channels.  I never really looked at it in depth.  Just the idea that this can be done is awesome!

If this becomes a common transaction paradigm, would it be possible to shrink this to a single transaction?

Some mimblewimble esque merging when address B and B' are both controlled by one person?

The information I always try to get out of these things is "how does the financial world think about blockchains?"
The majority of this release was uninteresting, describing how blockchains work in banking language with little insightful commentary.
Of the sections, I found section 6 (Challenges to adoption and implementation: risk management) to be the most interesting and insightful.  Though of the documents like this, this one was rather old hat.

I don't mean to make claims of why someone would do this, or even that someone currently is.  I also don't think its an attack.
But it is how it works, and how it will always work - no mater the parameters there will be competition for block space and thus a price where people can and can't participate.
This just puts some very rough bounds (but bounds none the less) on costs of actively manipulating this aspect of bitcoin.

Related: your landing page is so slow and cluttered that I've switched to an alternative.  I know your focus is monetization and the landing page is an afterthought in that context but on the chance you still care about users who don't care about your API it would be great if you could fix the landing page.  speed,  clarity.

I also think this is more of an argument against increasing the block size than for increasing the block size.

I should have specified BIP39. But I use electrum, and would consider any wallet which could facilitate this.

Nodes supply information which the entire network consumes, so percentage of load is actually a reasonable metric.

I wrote this because I was curious how expensive it would be to arbitrarily set the fee rate. We have to come to terms with the fact that one can always buy full blocks (and set the fee rate) for some price. (This isn't an attack, its fundamentally how Bitcoin works.)
* 0.15 $/transaction = 80 sat/byte * 1e6 byte/block = .8 BTC/block
* 0.50 $/transaction = 267 sat/byte * 1e6 byte/block = 2.6 BTC/block
* 0.15$ = 80 sat/byte * 2e6 byte/block = 1.6 BTC/block
Notably for a miner with 30% of the hash rate, this is 30% cheaper.  Also, the actual cost of inflating the fee rate depends on how elastic the demand is - buying 50% of the block space would still elevate fees.
What does this mean? The cost to transact is set by how valuable someone sees: 1. their transaction or 2. making the use of bitcoin expensive.  Also notable, the price of bitcoin does not change the cost of setting the feerate.
There are ~144 blocks per day.  Conservatively, to set a fee rate of 0.50 $/transaction (rather high) this costs 374 BTC/day or 280,000 $/day.  The actual cost could be 10% of this due to inelastic demand and miner collusion.
My personal opinion is that we need an order of magnitude increase in capacity before we really start to make fee setting costly.  And realistically, fee rate setting will be possible by rich actors for a long time into the future, regardless of the block size.

The white paper
@_date: 2016-11-11 14:47:27
I'm torn here. Clearly we need to do something to maintain Bitcoin's distributed strength. But what is the best course?
If we change the algorithm we will have a new asic race in which different parties control a super majority of hash power as they produce more efficient chips.
Additionally, an algo change can't address the fact that there is a TON of electricity in this one building... Just stick new Asics in there. In many ways the distribution could become even more centralized.
On the other hand we are close to an optimum of J/hash. Widespread deployment of Asics could start, embedding of Asics. This to me seems like the best solution, and we should not act in a way which delays this. But maybe I'm missing something.

This seems like an opportunity for the ecosystem to reinforce itself in a decentralized way. 
In the same way that miners have a vested interest in the success of bitcoin, so do holders - albeit a little less concentrated.  If the price jumps and holders have a significant amount of capital (and some already do) it would seem rational to spend some of that on efforts to increase the robustness of bitcoin.
One such key effort in my eyes would be development and deployment of an easy in home miner or embedded miners, even at a loss. And other efforts to better decentralize hash-power.
I'm actually curious why we haven't seen this, previously chips were increasing in efficiency too fast but the time seems ripe.

Barring any friction to and from the chain, yes.

Importantly several parts of Bitcoin do not scale linearly. So your 24 mb block estimate is an overestimate.

They know because each hop tracks the state of that hop's channel.  If you try to pay A and B through your single channel, but send all your funds to A, you cannot make a valid path to B. B will see this (or rather you will have nothing to convince your intermediary to B that you have funds) and therefore you cannot convince B that you have funds.  
This generalizes to many participants.
Edit. Note, the only states here are between two parties.  When you want to transact between three parties there must be a path of two-party "channels" between them.  
    You &gt; A &gt; B

Notably this was within a graph of 2500 nodes.  The Lightning graph will be much much bigger.
@_date: 2016-09-19 18:35:54
Do we expect performance to be constant with node count?  2500 nodes is nearly nothing and we don't get any idea of the relationship between node count and route detection here.
Love the data, though!

Hyperledger was explained by their CTO as a set of interchangeable modules representing different components of blockchain technology.  This allows you to customize a "blockchain" (database) to your needs for decentralization, redundancy, throughput and permissioning.
For example, you could select from several consensus mechanisms (POW, POS, BFT, Tendermint, Federated), ledger formats, etc.

Electrum for versatility and flexibility - you can make it do whatever you need.
Copay for simplistic, multi device multisig. (You have to sign from two different devices.)

These aren't remotely comparable. Though the ant observation is certainly interesting.
If you upload less than you download the difference is a cost to the network. The utility you get from having a copy of the blockchain hopefully outweighs that cost.  There are other considerations such as forwarding transactions but these are minor.
Lazy ants could be compelled to work in an emergency (or maybe they provide some other esoteric benefit).  Under-powered machines () can't be compelled to contribute to the network in any case and the costs/contributions are clearly defined.

Spot on IMO, though only evaluated in the context of consumer payments.  Didn't directly address the concept of a hard reserve currency.  But a great overview of Bitcoin as a "consumer product".
13 Blocks to Bitcoin Dominance
Our key conclusions are that; 1) bitcoin is likely to remain a niche payment network and unlikely to gain mainstream adoption, and 2) we see little scope for blockchain technology to disrupt the back-end architecture given that card acceptance already takes place instantly and card schemes provide invaluable dispute management which is difficult for a new technology to disintermediate.
...note eight key challenges that have the potential to limit the utility, and therefore reduce adoption, of blockchain systems.
Security vs Cost trade off: The security of the bitcoin blockchain is ensured by syntactic rules and computational barriers to mining. Permissioned architectures are cheaper to run, but as we increase our trust in permissioned authors, we lose the distribution which is a guarantee of ledger integrity

I wanted to run a full node and its way more fun to play around on a somewhat speedy machine than a slow Raspberry Pi.  As a result I got this little fanless box:
Throw some RAM and a HDD in there and you have a node capable of hosting and verifying the blockchain for the next several years.  As well as running lightning, tor, and other services that might be built on top of bitcoin. 
Plus its not super slow, so playing around is more fun!

Lightning is a fundamentally different technology than you described.
This reduces the space and computing requirements for storing and verifying signatures in a way which maintains the security and flexibility of currentt bitcoin.

I don't think they say that at all. They provide a very comprehensive and in my eyes accurate account of both technologies. They say that many or most "block chain" apps are needless - "technology looking for a nail". They discuss the challenges Bitcoin will face.
Ultimately they do say they think Bitcoin will not surmount these challenges. It's not a sure thing by any means but I do disagree with that position.
It's certainly not a Bitcoin bad block chain good analysis.

Thanks for this great reply.
A technicality: The original MW mentions compressing the chain to the current UTXO set + excess values. See Merging Transactions Across Blocks  though the details were left out so maybe thats the hitch.
Regardless, in this cut-through case you are suggesting that though the number of sigs we need to verify to catch up to the current block is lower - the number of sigs to verify at the chain tip (and compute on to compress) is much higher.  So catching up has scaled but block creation has gotten harder.
P2PK usage is duly noted, quantum resistance seems like it would be hard to incorporate.
Very interesting insights!
