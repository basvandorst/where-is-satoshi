A comment in that tax protesting video from 2011 makes a good point.  Where did all of her money come from?  What does she do for a living?

Sorry, didn't know you knew the guy personally.
@_date: 2015-12-14 23:40:02
You're right.  I've deleted it to save someone the same fate.
@_date: 2015-12-10 02:15:46
Seems like she did.
@_date: 2015-12-10 02:14:20
I enjoyed watching it.  Thanks.

You can't make this shit up.

Their rep said from the last purchase that brought you to your limit.

When was the last time you used bitinstant?
@_date: 2013-09-21 04:11:33
And xanax.

So you finally got your money? It seems like it would be in my best interest to wait awhile before buying my first coins..

There isn't a boa within like 1000 miles of me haha. Is it not possible to set up an online account with them then just do an account transfer?
@_date: 2013-04-13 16:32:00
Still nothing? Guess I better keep waiting..
@_date: 2013-06-16 01:30:38
Anything yet?

Did it go through? I've held off trying bitinstant what with all the negative reviews. I'm guessing that there's less volume of transactions now that the price caved. Still haven't pulled the trigger though.
