If you look at literally anything besides Bitcoin, you'll find the world doesn't agree on a single thing.

What about buy whenever, buy drugs?

I bought 40 BTC for $12 (total, not each) a looooooong time ago.
In the years following, that hard drive got reformatted many times, and eventually recycled.

You live in India?
10BTC would pay my rent for a month but no more than that. It's about 25-30 billable hours :(

Honestly this reads like a 5 - 10 BTC job depending on implementation details.

Thinking of selling Monaco for a bump.

Make sure to tell them that. It has the benefit of solidifying the real life use of Bitcoin, and I'm sure Made in Italy would appreciate the plug.

Nobody drew any conclusions as far as I am aware.

It's not meant as a monetary gift imo. Especially not in exchange for the prize.
It's like getting a small interesting gadget from that company at that convention -- You check it out, play with it for a minute and if you're interested, spend money on the real thing.
I think the possibility of physically buying a cup of coffee at Made in Italy should be enough to pique his interest. Whether the wallet holds 0.022BTC, 1BTC or 10BTC, I don't think he'll spend it. 1BTC isn't going to cover dinner when you're used to a certain lifestyle. It might tickle his curiosity though, and if it does, he will buy his own BTC to play with.

That's a bit annoying.

50-60 BTC is a shitload more than just €2000.
This would turn OPs €250 experiment into a €10,000 experiment.
edit: Unless you mean he should single him out? "You sir, get a full BTC. Unlike the other schmucks who get a cup of coffee" -- Not a great idea imo.

People at Goldman Sachs are still allowed to own dollars though, right?
In my opinion, that's the same as MtGox employees owning Bitcoin. It's a currency. I do really appreciate them not being allowed to trade on the exchange.
