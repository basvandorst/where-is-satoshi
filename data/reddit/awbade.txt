2 hours? I could program and cut that thing in 45 minutes once I created a vacuum fixture that could hold 4-8 of them at a time and then cut them out when they're done.

You lost me at Biometrics. I was considering it as a possibly until that point. It's sounding a little too conspiracy theory for me here.

When I'm not busy programming this part, I have some suggestions/Ideas and I'll give you some advice later.

I think that the public and people that create actual technology, such as Bitcoin are not stupid enough to rely on Biometrics. And yes, 25-30 years ago I would've laughed at those things you mentioned.
There's a big difference from a "US Government giving guns to drug cartels" theory, to a "The earth is flat, we all live in a dome with an ice ceiling and god at the center of the dome" theory (which is unfortunately a legitimate conspiracy theory with a surprising number of followers.) I was merely pointing out that in my opinion 
's post was starting to look a little more extreme when he busted out the global biometric identification crap. At least in my opinion

Aerospace Production Machinist here. I have an idea on how to do these a little better, I'll post more later when I don't have a part to program haha.

I didn't say that I believed it lol. Just that it was a decent story until he got to the biometrics part for me. I don't neccessarily believe in the illuminati or anything like that crap, but I do think that there are people out there who own enough money to make movements like this, and those people aren't dumb.
