But you are assuming the throughput of the consumption is constant. Here is a good example, say 1 out of 10 US citizen is buying playstation imported from Japan, totaling 30 million. When USD devalues, all of a sudden some folks end up not being able to afford it so only 1 out of 15 end up buying, totaling 20 million. So 10 million less consumed playstation which is produced in Japan. Instead though these people buy XBox because XBox is priced in USD, so they still can afford it.
Now you decreased the dependency on other countries while increased and thus supported your own local production, in turn generating more work for US economy, creating more jobs etc etc.
There is of course a huge downside, where for the essentials you absolutely have to buy (like oil for most countries, electronics for many) you are opening a bigger gap in your economy since newly minted money never gets distributed in full efficiency.
All in all for countries like US it is too fickle of a thing to play with (generally G7 countries avoided doing currency manipulation for decades) and this tool ends up being useful for lesser economies, but hey what do I know, I'm not an economist.

This actually is a rational thought process if you are trading for a while, since you have no idea where the bottom is and \`trying to catch a falling knife\` as many says is a dangerous thing to do. Say if you were looking at things this way a year ago, you could have said the same thing for $6,500 level purchase, yet it almost lost 50% of its' value by December.
On the other hand, if you have a ceiling and a comparison jumping on the bandwagon as the trend changes is not too bad. Once again if you looked at this a month ago "shut up and take my money" level would have been the $9,000 mark we passed and then fell back, yet anybody who bought then are in the clear. This is because they started buying in during an uptrend.
All in all nobody knows where it is going, but it is generally safer to join during bull markets then bear markets for the inexperienced trader.

This is beyond oversimplification of facts that I cannot believe this guy is from Yale.
\- Sure apartments pay rent, buy they also get old, sometimes depreciate etc
\- bonds pay interest but there are many cases those payments are even lower than inflation rate
\- stocks pay dividends, well yeah some do, some never did and might never do
Does above points make any one of these items "not an investment"? Also how about commodities? How about rare-metals?
Also does this guy even know what "cost of creation" even is? Does he think bitcoins fall off of a tree for free?

It is said that way because people put their rainy day fund into Bitcoin and that is borderline reckless behavior. Imagine the following scenario:
\- You have 3 months of expenses packed in your "EmergencyFund", and that is all you have. 
\- Enter Bitcoin in August 2017 you realize you "need" it. Put your fund in there
\- On June 2018 you lost your job and are behind your rent, yet your EmergencyFund can only cover you for a single month, which puts extra pressure on finding your next job.
That recommendation is for situations like these, where the money you put on Bitcoin might be absolutely critical to your day-to-day life.

If Bitcoin price today was $500 you would you say Bitcoin is less inflationary than dollar despite it still generating 1800 per day with the same total supply? What kind of logic is that? You cannot peg one unit to another and define inflation like that, and if you did that would be a metric of your invention, not what economists call "inflation".
Compare dollar to total dollar supply, compare Bitcoin to total Bitcoin supply.

By that definition putting your money on anything with uncertainty (surprise, pretty much everything in the universe) is a gambling, like buying stocks, picking the company you work for (since it can go bankrupt but the alternative might not), taking the early/late bus (since with same bus ticket you might find 1 million dollars worth of suitcase forgotten in one) ... Do you see the absurdity this gets stretched to?
Taking risk is a scale. Gambling in general covers the cases where "expected return" is lower than the money you put in. Therefore you put your money and hope that you get lucky even though on average you know you will lose money.
\- roulette is gambling, because the expected rate of winning 1:1 is known to be 49-51 even in the best case, therefore even you play it infinite number of times you are guaranteed to lose money.
\- lottery is gambling because probability of winning is much lower than the amount you put in even after normalizing all potential winnings you add up (all possible prizes multiplied with their probabilities added up)
What is not gambling is putting your money in the unknown with calculated risk. I.e.
\- Buying land from somewhere that is not valuable but might become the outskirts of a settlement (how majority of people got rich a century ago)
\- Buying stocks that are not proven their worth (with no dividend and uncertain future) like tech stocks back in 2001. Note that most people who did that lost all their money, but that was not gambling just putting their money in something they did not understand how it is being monetized.
\- Deciding to join a startup over Google/Facebook despite the good pay and benefits because you think your startup will appreciate many folds (does not work out for many, but works out pretty good for those who understand the landscape of their market).

You make great points, many of which I agree, except for the following insert:


Here you assume SF is static but by whatever factor the cost drops $500 will also trigger the flow. It is not like we do not have gold available in mine\~able property right now, but much like oil many of those are not profitable at current prices. Whatever caused the cost to fall to $500 therefore can do the following:
\- Now mining is much cheaper so previously unprofitable mines can be explored, making more gold to be produced, which in turn increases the flow and decreases the SF ratio making the dropping in the prices justified.
Of course this won't happen in a day, which gives room for arbitrage but things balance pretty quickly when money is involved. We see this in oil market all the time. Before 2014 tons of deepsea explorations took place because a barrel of $115 was justifying it, yet during 2014 it fell all the way to $38 per barrel which made most of Permian Basin oil unprofitable .. Fast forward 2 years it balanced back to $60-70 range, still way down from pre-2104 prices making at today's prices even Venezuela's coastal oil is not worth extracting.
tl;dr: at least for Gold SF actually is a pretty decent metric to compare to. This of course doesn't mean it is 1:1 applicable to Bitcoin like you mention.

I keep reading this, but it assumes a big portion of these millionaires being interested in owning bitcoin. There are also less than 20 million ounces of palladium available yet we do not see every millionaire fighting each other to own at least an ounce of it. Limited supply is only valuable when there is also increasing demand following it; the best example for this are altcoins, many of which having limited supply but due to lack of adoption they are not considered in this category.
Don't get me wrong, I believe Bitcoin will rise much further than what it is today, but let's be honest throwing these figures around are not really getting us anywhere.
@_date: 2019-07-31 17:51:14
There is unfortunately a major difference from the early days to today, and that is the capital needed to move the needle.
You see when Bitcoin was $1, assuming even 10 million coins were liquid (which clearly was not) the unrealistically high ceiling of moving it to $2 was additional $10m capital (note that it would raise to that price with much much less money due to the nature of prior exchanges changing the bottomline price expectations. To be honest you could have most likely done that with $10,000 in the short term.
Today even if the number of liquid coins is 1 million (which we know is not true since during bull runs multiples of that amount move), what $10,000 can give you is a blip in the exchange volume of a single Bitcoin changing hands, therefore an actual move requires more and more capital.
Now using market cap is terrible since it doesn't tell you much, but one thing is certain that there comes a point where available additional capital to flow in Bitcoin would be marginal to the one that already is parked by that time. Maybe today that amount is on the level of 10-20 billion dollars, but once it reaches 1 trillion dollars it will be much harder to move the needle.
@_date: 2019-07-23 13:35:53

Banks can and will choose whatever interest rate they loan out to you, so no they won't be giving you money so you can return less.
How \`negative yielding debt\` would impact the retail is that now you will have to pay a percentage of your holdings in cash to the bank for them to hold it for you. This is already implemented in few places like Switzerland or Japan.
"Well, why should I keep cash in the bank than I can just withdraw, right?" might be what you are thinking, and if so that is the intention that you put your money into some gear in the economy and make it a living part of it (for the banks' limitations they can always lower the max\_reserve\_ratio if that happens). If you want to keep it as a cash, well too bad for you since your home is not secure, and you may be able to get away with it for a small sum but for large amounts you need banking services regardless. There is also the idea of "e-cash" floating around in some IMF blogposts but AFAIK it did not gain any traction yet.

Well if you just adjust by inflation alone, $20k from 1970 would be worth $130k today. On top of that, the house might have been worth $20k back then, but with insane interest rates they had, they easily paid multiples of that amount, and if you adjust that (i.e. 7% interest rate from 70s, they actually end up paying $45k+) so their gains are not as insane as numbers make you think.
Sure they got a good deal, but not as crazy as we think they did.

They don't have to buy it all at once. They can get X% of the daily real volume over the course of many years and manage to accumulate tons of Bitcoins.

Marketplace had a really nice podcast about it actually, I should find the link and share here, but in the meantime here are few bullet points why:
1. Because human body loses its' productivity for many qualified jobs as age progress, therefore we cannot expect the elderly to have the same throughput as a 25 year old, but in capitalist environments hiring the elderly over the 25yo for many cases will result in a loss for the company having an open position
2. Because not everyone is nicely positioned in a spot where they can save, no matter how little that amount sounds to you. $100 a paycheck is indeed not a lot, but there are plenty of Americans who cannot afford to have excess $100 from their paycheck. It is easy to blame them, but if one borns into an environment that is toxic, it is really hard to get out for them unless they are properly educated on the toxicity. For instance most Americans are not thought the very basics of personal finance, how can they be expected to rationally save for 50 years later?
   1. Also because not everyone can be positioned into being able to have a proper job for long enough. There can be medical or mental issues preventing them. SS asks for minimum of 40 quarters of work give or take which is somewhat reasonable even for these individuals.
3. Because unexpected things happen. You lose you job and therefore your healthcare, got hit by a car and medical bills swipe away all your savings. Now what do you do? 
4. Because part of the society living in extreme poverty has very detrimental effects for the economy itself, and paying it through a social program is a relatively cheaper solution.

Well I treat mine as my 401k, where I won't touch them until some age and afterwards if they are worth something I will slowly transition into paying my day-to-day expenses with my Bitcoin whenever possible.

I'm not OP, not my chart. Just wanted to correct that part.


Government lends money to banks, so in this case it is the banks yes.




Pretty much this, but banks are actually not getting screwed, since in this plan government would be lowering the reserve ratio so banks can stay afloat (i.e. if reserve ratio is 5% today, meaning for every $5,000 deposited to banks they can loan out $100,000, they would lower it to 3% or 2% so banks do not get negatively impacted by regular folks withdrawing their cash, all the while can loan out like they do today with positive interest rates).

Well with their model, they have a quite resistant system (ignoring user error to lose login/2FA credentials). They 
\- Keep 98% of the coins in the cold storage with extensive multi-sig wallets
\- Have whitelisting feature so that even if a malignant entity gains control of your account and adds a new receive address you have 48 hours to act on it
\- FDIC insure the cash in there and only allow withdrawal to Bank accounts with exact name of the KYC owner
\- Also privately insure their hot wallet (2% of the assets) properly in case they lose it.

Just make sure rates are as percentage of the total purchase price. I.e. in GDAX (Coinbase Pro) or Kraken, you pay a percentage (i.e. 0.15% for limit orders) so it doesn't matter if you buy $25 worth or $2500 worth of Bitcoins in one sitting.

Bonds have their own purpose, being mainly risk free and all. Sure their expected return is way less than stocks, but when retirement is right around the corner and you cannot risk big fluctuations you convert your portfolio into a bond heavy version to ensure your retirement annual returns are consistent year over year even during a major recession.
Another application of bonds is the pensions. You cannot risk pensions on thing with any risk of total failure because that would mean screwing your own employees. Not worth the risk.
That being said if you are younger than 55 year old and an individual investor, there is not much point in investing in bonds for more than 5% of your portfolio.

This is an interesting remark. Not sure if I agree or disagree. I can theorize what might happen but at the end of the day without the real event it is really hard to simulate the market. It might go two ways:
1. Like you suggested nothing happens because whereever it disappeared from has no more demand for gold
2. There actually was a need for the gold (i.e. collateral, insurance or international trade etc) and the disappearance require the original owners to replace it
If people/governments hoard gold just for the sake of hoarding gold it would be direction  and like you said nothing would change in the price. I would lean on  though, that they somehow need it for some sort of insurance. In this case there would be a sudden increase in demand and until mining catches up we can see steep increase in the price, which would make SF ratio a valid metric again. This of course will create a gold rush (similar to the profitability point I made above) making inflation rate of gold high until the equilibrium can be found.
Btw just for reference, most of the gold available today is not for sale. This is also one of the reasons why even slight increase in demand can squeeze the market and creates volatility. So if half the gold disappears in minutes it is not unlikely to think that there would be a huge supply/demand shortage.
Finally let us not forget that there are "paper gold" market in today's exchanges, so technically gold's stock can be near-infinite until there is an equivalent of "bankrun" happening for gold owners who do not keep their own stash.

Honestly, that would be the safest and most logical thing to do. But at that level I would probably pick the volatility and hope that crypto would make a difference for me. 
After all putting $40 per month in IRA's ($500 a year) is not going to make too much difference even with 5-7% annual appreciation once you have the social security kicks in, and that is 30-40 years down the road for many. Buying into the hope of the "new economic paradigm" sounds more interesting instead :)

I would say it is. Gold has been the trusted international currency of the world for millenias before it fell out of favor. Countries exchanged their debt in gold, they still do to some extent. We are talking about a precious metal that had worldwide adoption not just by people but by governing organizations, foundations of the civilized world.
To achieve the representation of the levels of gold therefore is a very serious milestone, which cannot just be reached by portion of world population putting their pocket cash into Bitcoin. We need serious acceptance/backing from organizations representing us, like central banks keeping part of their reserve in Bitcoin, companies exchanging their payments in Bitcoin etc. They way Bitcoin is setup today, this is a very hard to achieve goal, since storage of the coins and spending requires heavy trust on few individuals handling them as well as the transaction limits of our technology as of today. Bitcoin needs to seriously evolve if it wants to be a contender to gold.

So people who saved up and paid for a property are assholes for trying to make money off of their investment, because somebody thinks all land is heritage of humanity. I wonder if you would feel the same way if the entirety of India decides to move to USA and takes 80% of the current land, since they have quadruple the population.


The solution you are suggesting will only end up some very rich people grabbing up all the valuable land, since the current owners have no choice but to sell, or have to pay taxes they cannot afford due to propping up the prices. Rich can afford to put a high price on the land up until they have the monopoly and make even more off of it.

Even though on paper I am making %12 more than I did a decade ago, purchase power of my wages went down like 40%. I used to be able to have plenty of disposable income, nowadays I can barely pay my rent and other expenses after putting money aside for retirement savings.

That is not how equilibrium works at all. I would suggest you to write a simulation and see what the convergence will look like. Hint: It will have a threshold of a percentile in terms of net worth owning everything in minimum amount of grab from each other, with incredibly high rent for the rest.

Though you are correct in theory, in application market cap still is a very useful measure, because liquidity over long term matters.
Going back to your example of VictorCoin, sure Bob bought it for a dollar, but will you be able to find buyers for the next 1,000 VictorCoins, all paying a dollar each? If not you might have to give it a discount, say sell at $0.70. What about the next 5000 VC, at $0.40? By the time you are trying to sell your millionth coin you are very unlikely to even find a buyer who is willing to put cash in it. So yes, when first coin was sold VC market cap was $70B, during next 100 it was worth $49B, by the time you reached to the millionth coin it ended up being worth close to nothing.
You see, market cap in short term can indeed be very misleading, but if you look at the trends and average over time and combine the information with the liquidity it actually tells you a lot. Bitcoin is relatively liquid (i.e. in an exchange I can generally find a seller or buyer within cents away of the current price). The part market cap is misleading is the locked away coins and the potential impact of their mass release (i.e. whale attack) so it should be taken with a grain of salt, but as a comparative measure between well reputed coins it actually gives you enough to operate on.
Another thing about market cap is that it gives you theoretical boundaries. For instance I know for sure 1 bitcoin will never be worth $1B in 2019 dollars, because that is larger than the entire worlds' asset worth. I also know the economics of the world has to change for it to even reach $1M. I can also assert and estimate how many people need to use Bitcoin for it to capture a particular market cap (note that after some price rise people who made a lot of money start liquidating so things balance eventually). This gives me confidence intervals on where it might realistically reach on what conditions (i.e. 500M Bitcoin users around the globe with median holding of 0.01Btc can justify $X,YZ).

Sure they were better off, but that just means you manage to keep your savings and spend from there. It is hardly a preferred condition to be in, you are just getting by better than other citizens to some extent. It still cannot be a justifying argument for the 'fiat collapse' dreamers, since they are better off with a government successfully running the fiat show than a post apocalyptic survival environment.
Also, gold is all swell until government decides to confiscate it (i.e. 1933 Roosevelt action). It is not like Bitcoin is fully anonymized, and can easily be announced illegal to use by the government, so I wouldn't say it is a surefire way to avoid hyperinflation.

I would be fun to look at other staple asset classes such as S&amp;P500, VTSAX, REIT funds etc **in the same time period (since otherwise they will be like 99.9% profitable).** 
For S&amp;P 500 we can easily see this metric would look much better than Bitcoin since it is near ATH for instance. Which brings me to my next point. **Perhaps it should be a weighted average where ROI is also baked in**.

This is not entirely true though. I.e. US Federal Reserve was founded in 1913, but was not able to create value out of thin air until Nixon abolished the Gold Standard (aka pegging USD to fixed gold supply) in 1971.

Thanks, this was pretty much the answer I was looking for.
I'm not genuinely concerned in price since I do not plan to do anything with my coins until next-next halving (so probably 6 years down the road), or the one after that (10 years?) if I'm still not comfortable. I just put small percentage of my savings into it to diversify and am prepared to lose it all if that is how things turn out so short term fluctuations are for entertainment only :)

It is very safe to assume 1m coins lost pretty much from all estimation accounts. Some people draw this number up to 4m due to inactivity in early accounts but as a pessimist I incline to ignore them. 
For all practical purposes I assume there will ever be 20 million Bitcoins. Easy to calculate that way as well. If it is a bit less, just a nice surprise for me :)

There is an easy solution to this: "never go grocery shopping when you are hungry!". 
In other words, if you are a trader when you are not emotional, make a plan and stick with it no matter what. Are you accumulating? Make a plan on how much you will be spending on accumulating month after month and when to stop doing that. Are you offloading? Make a plan on what percentage of your holding you will sell on what future date, then stick with that decision. Sure you won't be able to buy at the bottom and sell at top but your emotions will never get in the way.

I do not see how this can be true. Bitcoin inflation is embedded into the code. For every block found there is a fixed reward. As for the frequency of blocks found, difficulty adjustment should settle it so on average one is found every 10 minutes. I do not see how short term fluctuations of hash-rate can have a long term effect on inflation rate.

This was due to after effects of WWI which also brought a huge loss of value to most German assets, so if redditors here assuming same would happen to US Dollar are missing out the fact that having few Bitcoins won't be enough to survive such a shock when your house loses its' value, when you cannot even find food in your grocery store etc.

I am talking about the bubbles in Bitcoin when I quote the 4 years time-length. The longest it took was 860 business (trading) days for Bitcoin to outperform one of the best staple indices in the world (S&amp;P500), which is a bit short of 4 years.
Nikkei is a good example for a particular market stagnation that happens in a reliably large high functioning economy, so it can hold to pretty much any market if underlying reasons repeat, that is independent of Bitcoin or USD or Yuan etc.

I am not sure why people keep bringing this up. Majority of the fiat exchange happens in private databases today, so why does Bitcoin have to abide by a 'flattened' global standards that even fiat does not operate on? Sure if people want to do it in layer-1 they should be able to (and they do) but this does not mean it is the only option, and clearly many small transactions can still operate on the notion of trust.
I.e. take credit cards. When you swipe your card do you think an immediate 1:1 transaction is happening between your bank account to the retail seller? Quite contrary, Visa/Mastercard etc practically appends a 'potential transaction', which only resolves after a period of time (usually days, sometimes over a month) and does a one time aggregated transaction. So why can't we assume the same for Bitcoin? Why does all the world needs need to happen in 1st layer?
@_date: 2019-11-21 23:22:54
Though it makes sense I have one problem with this theory. Looking at history of biggest bubbles (South Sea Company, TulipMania etc), once they pop and people rush into dumping their holdings, they never go back to the same thing. After all if a bubble popped, it means it no longer holds any value so why buy it back?
Then you look at Bitcoin, and admittedly up until 2018 I thought it was a bubble too: it popped multiple times, yet after a while people keep coming back to it and **Bitcoin comes back much stronger.** What kind of a bubble is that? If it popped it means it holds no value anymore, yet it's value keep increasing after each bubble.
So say it pops again and goes down to 1k like u/[UniqueUsername642]( hypothesized, why should I panic and sell if there is a reasonable chance that eventually it will pick up from where it was left off?
Disclaimer: I am someone who passed the chance of buying Bitcoin in 2012, then in 2014, and then in 2017 all the while believing it was a bubble; contrary to one of my best friends who retired in Puerto Rico thanks to it. Now I am slowly diversifying into it as a portion of my net worth. Still not a 100% believer, but now I think it is here to stay.

I gave an extreme example indeed to make the thought experiment worthwhile, but reality is actually towards that direction. Boomers all around the world are aging (so far health-technology kept them alive albeit causing older population) while even many third world countries started relying on birth control. It is not too far fetched to see that human population growth will stagnate and even revert in the next 2-3 decades, which will translate into less demand for real-estate. Sure the impact won't be like the doomsday scenario, but it would still cause unexpected price action, especially for those who are leveraging to buy real-estate.

I do not think that is their (governments') idea. The reason why they use it is to be able to track all money exchange, which honestly has huge merits on tax collection, illegal activities etc at the cost of citizens' privacy.

You seem to ignore the utility aspect of things. If there exists a network that provides slightly different values that users want, they can easily success and co-exist.
Consider Facebook/Instagram and Twitter. Both are social networks and most people who are on twitter has an account in the other side too, but this does not kill the usage of Twitter because it really has different value proposition. 
Similarly some coins that excel at privacy, or scaling, or speed etc can be contenders, and one cannot rule out this possibility.

Correct, but in this case it is not a banana argument. The fact that someone has to spend energy means they are paying it in some way, not obtaining it for free, so it establishes a baseline market price.
Think of it like this: if the person who is selling it to you simply obtained it for free (or incredibly low price), would you be willing to pay for that item? Why wouldn't you mine it yourself in that case? The fact that they have to spend electricity (even if that electricity is completely wasted) is a cost to them that blends into what you are paying for the resulting item they obtain.

Bitcoin is far from being a good medium-of-exchange (so much better solutions exist today minus the decentralization, which is not the deal breaker for MoE purposes). It is also far from being the ideal Unit-of-Exchange. 
It is indeed a great store of value, definitely better than Gold in that aspect, however what I am underlying here is that there is a theoretical cap on the flow of money that prevents most of the investment money away from 'store of value'. Before Bitcoin came along gold was the best known SoV, yet it never crossed 20%+ range of the narrow money supply, even during recessions, simply because most people are not looking to park their money in SoV.

I am and active believer of Bitcoin, but I can see why bch can be useful, especially while their on chain transactions are so cheap. 
If I am investing in Bitcoin I would buy Bitcoin, but if I plan to buy a cup of coffee wouldn't it make more sense to buy and use bch, at least until Lightning has proven its' network and usefulness? Currently LN is not as seamless as bch. Nano is another alternative for the same use case.

I think my point here is being lost. I am not saying Bitcoin is worse than Gold, what I am pointing out here is that there is limited portion of narrow money flowing into SoV assets that have majority of their supply dormant, and even Gold, which was supposed to be the king of this segment before Bitcoin came could only attract 9T worth of it. Assuming Bitcoin taking over Gold market, where is this extra 12T of valuation coming from (which would require realistically new 1T inflow of money)?

One that comes to mind is the sunk costs. When the cost is projected it generally includes the infrastructure/housing/machinery as well (i.e. renting a warehouse, the cost of the miners, setting up the miners professionally etc).
 Say I bought an antminer S17-Pr for about $3,000. Clock is ticking on its' validity since within next 2 years it will probably be obsolete. So if I average out the amount I am getting from it today I might be at loss but if I don't mine that $3,000 will be waste. In other words if you count out the sunk cost I am still making a profit (from pure electricity point of view) but my overall ROI is negative, it is just that not mining is an even worse choice in these circumstances.

Perhaps, though I must admit I am not a "crypto person". I barely started getting involved with it about 11 months ago, and even then I am allocating a small percentage of my monthly retirement savings into it, you know just for diversification purposes. I own practically nothing regards to my net worth (which is not high to be honest). As for the economy theories, I find it intriguing as it is not like material sciences where hypothesis become facts through rigorous and repeated experiments. Instead you find relatively vague pointers and historical events shaping up, proving and disproving their standing. It is hard to bastardize something that is already somewhat ripe to be transformed/evolved rather quickly as environment changes.
So yeah, I might be doing a bit of that, but if I do it is certainly not intentional. What I do however is to try to analyze the arguments as objectively as possible and carve out some wisdom if possible.

I must admit that it keeps the unemployment numbers low (since there is more easy money for corporations they can hire more cheap labor), so it is less binary on the poor populace (i.e. less number of people below the poverty line at the expense of eroding middle class). I can see it being an efficient tool when unemployment is high, but that is not the case for USA, and does not seem to be the case for Germany either.


That being said it is a race to the bottom. Not just ECB/Fed, it is Bank of Japan, People's Bank of China etc. Problem is when one gets to do it and devalue their currency, it makes the competition for corporations unfair on the others so the rest feel pressured to do so. This is one of the primary reasons why current USA/China conflict exists today (that and the IP rights).
The ones who are paying the price is always the general populace though, and they get to have the least say in these policies, so it is totally unfair. Not so different than piracy imho!

In general keeping 100% of your wealth in anything is a terrible idea, but ...


This is a key identifier. There is something called "Risk Tolerance" when it comes to investing. To put it simply, how hurtful it would be for losing your investment defines your tolerance, and it is mainly impacted by two factors:
1. How old you are: the closer you are to retirement, you lower your risk tolerance is. This is because in case you lose high portion of your investments, you will have much harder time replacing them to the level needed and the clock is ticking since your most productive days are behind you.
2. How much of a money are you risking, w.r.t. your future needs: $1,000 means sth different to folks around the globe sure, but considering you and you alone, what does it mean today vs 30 years down the road (average investment growth adjusted).
The key takeaway is that younger you are and smaller the amount higher risks are tolerated and in fact encouraged. You are 23; most people your age do not even have savings and spend their money on useless glittering things, trinkets and baubles, despite them being paid for in blood. You should not punish yourself for taking high risk.
Now anybody reading this who is 35+ and has family/kids, doing this is very irresponsible of you, and quite frankly greedy. If Bitcoin performs as people expect it to be, even allocating 15-20% of your net worth would be enough to save the day as long as you are patient.

That is a faulty argument though: since the resources as well as consumers are bounded, how will the world economy value be unbounded?

Nothing wrong with what you are doing (in fact I think it is much wiser than alternatives) but I cannot resist picking at


1. guaranteed part is the finiteness but not the utility of it. I.e. what you are saying would have made any land in the state of New York extremely valuable from 200 years ago perspective given population growth. Instead people built skyscrapers and clustered around small pockets of land, leaving huge empty lots anywhere outside the city of New York and city of New Jersey. Point is, land can be limited, but technology can make that limit obsolete to some extent
2. "Always going to be in demand", really depends on population growth. If human population dwindled down to 1 billion, would you assume land would be as valuable as today?

Also I was not really interested in whether he was right or wrong, but more interested about how the general Bitcoin audience felt about such predictions coming from a "big-shot" who put his money where his mouth is. The reason why I ask is because since hindsight is 20/20 I can see 10k prediction not as outrageous so it is hard for me to compare to today's equivalent.

That is the inflation on paper. That assumes I have the same distribution of expenses as an average rural American citizen has. Just my rent alone more than doubled in the last 6 years, not even a decade, so I don't care what the BLS says, infilation for me was way more than 30% since 2008.

\[In 2019 dollars\] Frankly, no! Not because of Bitcoin but because of market forces. 
One should question why Gold market cap has not been exceeding 20% of the global narrow money supply all these years, and can arrive to the conclusion that only some people hold their money store of value, and among them almost none keeps it all in one asset class. 
$1m per Bitcoin in 2019 dollars mean $21T market cap, which is \~50% of the global narrow money supply. If gold never achieved even half of that mark, why do you think Bitcoin will. Where will this magical flow of money come from? 
The theoretical maximum I can see is $300-400K range, and even that would likely take a long time.
Just my two cents.

They are very different, but from valuation perspective they share the most important treat: store-of-value qualities. Also I am not comparing them per se, what I am pointing out here is that there is limited portion of narrow money flowing into SoV assets that have majority of their supply dormant, and even Gold, which was supposed to be the king of this segment before Bitcoin came could only attract 9T worth of it. Assuming Bitcoin taking over Gold market, where is this extra 12T of valuation coming from (which would require realistically new 1T inflow of money)?


True, but what is the incentive for any country to do this? It would mean they give up their control on their sovereign money and capital control, which is a terrible idea. Look at what happened to Greece after 2008? If they had the chance to print Drachmas they would have been recovered in 5-6 years (at the expense of their people), instead they had to suffer austerity Germany/France is pushing down their throat for over a decade and things are still not looking that bright.

Interesting choice. For text based features Bi-LSTM generally makes perfect sense as natural language has tendency of dependency on either direction, but I am curious what kinds of features on price prediction is benefitting from this.
As for the convolutions, I am assuming it is windows of price actions on time series. Do you do a grid search on what convolution windows make sense or let NN pick the best fits? 
Finally do you mind sharing what activation function and what optimizers you picked for your model?

Essentially yes for export based sectors (similar for Germany since German economy afaik is heavily export based -i.e. automotive-). Basically what happens is that company C in China, company U in USA produce the same stuff which has $X value globally while having different cost-lines. Things like raw-material cost-lines are mostly stable across all currencies in the globe, but things like workforce have local dependencies.
Say today C can produce the product for $0.9X and sell for $X; while for U it costs $0.95X (workforce costs more) to produce but that is OK since U is OK to have lower margins. Now assume China devalued Yuan 10% and half the costs is workforce. All of a sudden they can produce the same product for $0.85X, and keeping the same margins they can sell if for $0.95X. U cannot compete anymore because they have no profit margin, so unless USD gets devalued as well American companies would have no choice but to move their production to cheaper countries, costing jobs at home. 
Of course there are many more variables but above summarizes what I mean by the "pressure" and how "currency-wars" impact it.

Not sure what is 'weird ass' here. Have you ever heard of "handmade" label? Is there a good justification on why those would have significant premium on their price to their factory counterparts? It is not mere uniqueness, since you can incorporate randomness into the pattern using machines too. It is mostly the amount of effort going into it.
The entire area of price justification is bogus anyways, it is all about what people think it is 'fair' for that very product, balanced by supply/demand to some extent. There is no good reason why "Mueles" from Monet is **$110m**, not $65m, not $289m, not $15,000. However if one were to have the option to obtain an equally viable Monet painting for $15,000 do you think "Mueles" would have been valued at $110m? **The fact of the matter is, cost to the seller is a huge factor on the price justification of buyer.**


Everything is a product of something else, so yes it is a product.


And those have pretty linear conversion rate. If I am getting paid for my time, I am also getting paid for my energy. This is like saying "You are getting paid in USD so you cannot spend it on Europe". Guess what I might be living in an EU country, getting paid in USD and it would still be valid for me to justify all my expenses in Euro since that is the currency I abide by.

Though I agree with your conclusion that it is bad for British economy, I just want to nitpick this part.
Trade is not a zero-sum game for the closed domain you are looking at, but can be zero-sum globally. I.e. here is a thought experiment; if leaving a large trade block is an economic suicide, we can actually infer that joining one is an economic advantage, and rightfully so since it is due to having more leverage on trade agreements ... up to a limit. What if the entire world was an economic block, would you still have the same advantage? You no longer have the edge on your competitors to gain larger market share because they belong to the same block as you do and have access to the same market at same price. This sounds very much like a zero-sum game to me. What am I missing?
@_date: 2019-08-11 14:46:38


Do you mean state sponsored effort? Because otherwise cost/reward should prevent countries from doing so (i.e. despite over 168 countries how many companies of airplanes do we have? Boeing ,Airbus ...). If anything even those companies would not be profitable without state sponsorship (i.e. Airbus has huge EU support).


Unless people start making garbage quality material at first they cannot enter the market. If we advocate for only few sources taking ownership of certain markets we are effectively supporting monopolies or oligopolies, which is known to be the killer of innovation.
In fact, even if we are a single economy I would assume things would play out in the same way they do today and any profitable economic segment would be relatively decentralized due to incentives. I.e. US is a single economic block yet we have automotive assembly plants all over the country with many different automaker (some not even US brands).


Well depends on what the 'cost/utility' function of said efficiency is; because today it is all about profit.


Yes if tomatoes and pasta is much less profitable. The truth is agriculture doesn't pay the bills very much. You can buy a truck worth of corn for a box of silicone chips. In your analogy Italy doing what its' habitat allows the best would simply leave them as the poorer part of the block. Yet somebody has to grow the food.


Which brings us to the most important point that binds everything we said so far, both you and me: what/who decides which nation is better suited to do something. Is Iraq suited to build planes? No? Why not? Should US be the tech power house of the world despite having so much fertile land ready for agriculture but is not used due to profitability (most agriculture is state supported here)? Right now we have an idea because of what we have seen so far, but that was mostly due to geopolitical arrangements, wars and different trade agreements. If WWI and WWII did not happen would US still get the brightest minds of the world as immigrants? What about Europe, what is it more suited at? 
In this scenario wouldn't everybody try their hardest to get know how of most advanced technological segments (which are not state secrets anymore) and attempt to produce the most bang for the buck items? 


You are 100% right, but the background reasons on why you are good at something might have everything to do with your geopolitical arrangements, which a single trade block would disintegrate.


Finally, despite everything I said so far I actually agree with your argument in theory. Just don't see how it applies to practice, but doesn't matter this was a good response so here take my upvote :)

Well survival bias would have been applicable when there are thousands of available predictions and we are looking back to find one that fit the condition. At this point however it is an already identified single prediction that is "forward facing". Meaning if Anon's prediction comes true it could not be explained by survivorship bias, it would purely be luck (unless Anon really knows what s/he talks about but as a non-believer of TA stuff I would lean on luck).
What would really struck me is if the Anon's next 3 predictions come true, since chances of correctly prediction time and price range on 3 different spots in a forward facing "prophecy" would imply astronomically ridiculous  luck. I might end up joining the sect of TA believers in that that case :P

First off, I already am putting substancial amount of my net worth into it (not 80% yet though but quite high so I am putting my money where my mouth is), but there is nothing "guaranteed" about VTSAX or any specific index fund. Just because historically it operated that way doesn't mean it would indefinitely do so. As you know VTSAX is a US market index fund. Boomers were living in a much different America than the Silent-Gen (depressioners) did, and we are living in a much more different America than Boomers did. Who knows what would happen in the next 20-30 years, who can guarantee our economy on average would grow as much as it used to?
Look at Nikkei for instance: from 1950s till 1990s it had remarkable stable and consistent growth; which could not been sustained due to many reasons such as demographic change, world market share decline, losing their competitive advantage etc, and for the last 25+ years it still has not recovered.

I suppose that is correct, I just cannot put my finger on which aspect plays a bigger role in general. My gut tells me it is the leverage, but I might be wrong.
From the original thread, I think the losses UK will face is mostly due to not having the same leverage and trade agreements EU has, rather than lack of common set of standards. This is pretty much why US is also a huge powerhouse due to all 50 states together having huge leverage on consumption, likewise for China and India can be considered union of large bodies as well. I.e. if California decided to leave US (despite being the biggest economy in there with putting more into federal than it gets back) it would be on the losing side because it will not be treated with the same respect as US does today.

This is not correct. Weimar Republic indeed only paid a small portion of their war reparations but this is not due to them inflating their currencies but because they did debt restructuring through Young Plan and Dawes Plan).

Ah I see, that can make sense, but even still I am surprised that in such a market you can still find renters. I.e. if I was a renter where I could technically pay off the property in 7 years worth of rent, wouldn't it be worthwhile to get a 30 year loan myself (even with low downpayment high rates with PMI it still would be affordable)?
For reference the place I used to rent was amortized in 200 months of the rent I paid, excluding any maintenance and tax implications. If it was around 90 months I would most likely have moved out or found a way to buy such a property myself.
Another thing about leveraged buying is that if the landscape of renters change during a time of recession (no idea which part of UK you are living but I am assuming one that has plenty of jobs now) at the same time when house prices are down, wouldn't that risk force you to liquidate some of those properties?

This is not necessarily a bad thing. Bitcoin is not here to be shoved (shave?) down people's throats, it is here for anybody who wants to participate in the network. If someone wants to use Libra, there shouldn't be any reason to stop them as long as they are educated about its' risks.
On the flip side, Coinbase having Libra can also means there would be another exchange route open: Libra/BTC. If by any chance Libra becomes successful and widely used, it would make it much easier to buy Bitcoin, since there would be wallets implemented that would hold both. This might even raise awareness on what Bitcoin is and might eliminate the public FUD. Since Libra is pegged, it is totally a different type of asset (if we can call it an asset) anyways.

Despite her arguments being sound, I somehow shut my ears and only looked at short term results.
Fast forward to 2019, she BaristaFIREd comfortably in Puerto Rico (not insanely rich, but certainly can live the rest of her life in comfort), while I am stuck at my 9-to-5 job. I now however have enormous respect for her financial judgement.

@_date: 2019-08-27 17:31:49


Can you give us some references for why this would be the case? I see no supporting evidence suggesting this.
Also without knowing the nature of the recession it is very hard to arrive to this conclusion. There are light recessions where money flees to "safe" assets, then there are recessions which are practically liquidation events where money only flows to hard&amp;productive assets (like in high demand rental properties, food/shelter etc). In fact a very good example to this is the gold price fluctuation following 2007-2008 crisis, where gold retracted from $1,100 per oz to $700 (which is a huge decline for what is supposably a "safe" asset uncorrelated with the markets) only to fully recover by 2010, which was fueled by very heavy QE promises from all over the globe.

When you zoom out and look at the long term chart these short term fluctuations does not impact the long term trend (whether that trend is upwards or downwards) as much as people think they do.

His words are a quote. Quotes depend on context, especially when you use them to support an argument. In this case the quote is said directly for a certain situation (which has historical records as proofs), has the obvious context, and does not support the argument it is used here.
Here is an example, I can quote "**To thine own self be true**" and put Shakespeare’s name appended to it to support a claim. The context of this however is that it belongs to the character Polonius, who is a hypocrite and these words are meant to be reflecting the hypocrisy in Hamlet.
Another great example is "**Beauty is truth, truth beauty**", by Keats. It is often used for its' direct meaning, but in context it is actually a criticism of the mundane views of society.
My point is, you cannot isolate a sentence, take it out of context and use it to validate your own point of view, especially if it is fairly orthogonal to the view you are suggesting.

OK so his original investment was sth like $102. What you are saying that those who have invested that much (say 0.01 btc for simplicity) will be in the same situation in 9 years.
There were over 5.7 million addresses that had 0.01 bitcoin or more as of end of 2018, let's say it remained the same. That is way too many multimillionaires for the world. Current estimations are about 30 million btw.
Let's say world can handle 5-6 million more multi millionaires, but the picture is weirder. Among these 5.7 million addressed over 130,000 have 10+ bitcoins. If 0.01 btc will be 20 million by then, 10 bitcoins will be 20 billion. That is just not feasible, as number of billionaires today are not even on the 5 figures level, and introducing 6 figure new multi billionaires is a pipe dream.

There is a cap though. I.e.

Not impossible if we have interstellar travel, but still quite unlikely.
My point is as the numbers grow large it gets exponentially harder for them to grow exponential yet further. Now what is this cap for Bitcoin? I have no idea, but certainly somewhere much lower than total liquid asset market, which is around $240 trillion. Even $20 trillion would be a miracle (and that is not even $1m per bitcoin).

I am not in the game of prediction, you might be right about the direction it is going, but certainly not the price target you are putting by above calculations.

I really hope you are being sarcastic here. A couple people lost their jobs and money? That's it? Just because you did not feel the impact doesn't mean there was not a global chaos.
First off, let's talk about aggregate impact. Just the fact that pretty much all world currencies together hand-in-hand lost value to all other assets without similarly adjusted wages means majority of the world has been stripped off of their purchase power. What I could buy with my 2007 salary cannot buy me the same things today 12 years after the crisis, despite my wage growth, all because some greedy mf's decided to play 'derivates game'.
Then let's talk about localized specific impacts. Do you know what happened to Greece? To Iceland? To Spain, Italy ... Have you been waiting in food lines because even if you desperately looked for jobs there were none in these countries and your children were starving, all because some other greedy mf's in those countries joined in to the Wall Street's 'derivative game' and bet their countries economy on it?


Oh let's not get into logical fallacies, this is a clear case of \`ignorantio elenci\`, specifically \`red herring\`. Just because those countries have seen worse, for various reasons of their own fault (Chavez's policy, Iran's politics, oil price tanking etc) does not justify what we have gone through in the last decade and certainly does not make it a rosy pink situation.

I think it was actually a third confounding variable that made them look like they were linked: **the hash rate**. If you look closely bch/btc ratio was closely overlapping with their hashpower ratio. There were even pools specifically mining bch even though they made a bit less in money for political reasons. Perhaps market takes this as a proxy to find which option is here to attract the larger part of the network and that reflects in the price due to split of demand.
Then what is new? This is just a theory, but the new mining machines (like s17) are here now and they are much more powerful. However in order to justify their price you have to mine with max profit, which comes from btc mining over bch mining right now. As the hasrate ratio of bch/btc falls so does the price parity.
Or maybe I am totally off and are just finding patterns in an uncorrelated set of variables flying around :)
For reference:
\- this is how bch hashrate over last 3 months look like: [
The decline in BCH hash rate is mere 0.3 EH

The increase in BTC hash rate is over 30 EH in the same time period.

Some debt can be "useful". I.e. lots of cards have 0% introductory APR for 12-18 month periods. This means even if you have the money, you are better of using your money on surefire investments and spend on the card, since fiat is almost guaranteed to lose value, and when the introductory period is close to ending you pay it off.

Inflation calculators use CPI, which is a weighted average of many items/services. Individual item inflations could be much larger or much smaller than the CPI calculation (i.e. house prices and shelter expenses skyrocketed in the last 2 decades, which is way above CPI average).

Well I am referring to OP's screenshot, that is my context. Now,
average is expected value, given a vector summing every item in that vector up and dividing by the width of said vector. Clearly each cell in this vector is one such fiat currency, so when OP says 'average' it means what I said.
What you are suggesting is called "weighted average", and each cell has some associated weight in it (i.e. lifetime of the currency could be one here), but no such thing is referred in the said screenshot.
If the context of this you shared is taking weighted average I would admit that it would be a somewhat better metric (still far from perfect), but my point to the original post needs no correction.

It is not a matter of whether there are 100 million people who can afford it, it is the metric you are using:
By your own means you are trying to deduce "Scenario only needs 1.35% of the population", but the population you are taking cannot do it. If there was 100 million people who can afford it in the world, you would be needing 100% of that target population to accumulate in such manner. If it was 500 million you would need 20% of the whole population to follow the same strategy. That 1.35% you are assuming cannot be right because the addressable market is much smaller than what you are assuming.

They do mean the portion of profitable to extract indeed from your link and explanation, but that and available is not the same thing. I.e. if today you found 20 tons of 'provable' reserves, it doesn't mean you can extract and sell them tomorrow, which is what 'available' means I suppose. If it would take 20 years to extract all gold in said reserves, can we say they are available today?

The population who have leisure income (excess of their expenses, short or long term) of $10 a day is a much smaller subset than you are assuming globally. Even in the developed world (i.e. OECD countries for reference), not everyone can put aside $300 a month (even if you are assuming people would put all their eggs in the same basket, which they won't) after all their expense.
\- Let us make a ballpark estimate, say we will count entire population of a country if their 2% of annual income exceeds this limit (assuming 20% tax, and 10% savings rate afterwards leaving them 8% leisure income, and say they are willing to put 1/4th of this in Bitcoin in this hypothetical scenario, so 2% of their overall annual income); we will end up with $3,600 per year leisure income, so we are looking at $180k GDP per capita. Oops, no such country exists.
\- OK let us relax our conditions and say people will put all 8% of their leisure to Bitcoin in this utopia, so we will end up with $65k. Pretty much Luxembourg only.
\- You know what, let's assume 20% savings rate and everybody who can afford to have $10 a day in these countries to put all their leisure income, so we are fine with GDP per capita of $32k. Now we are talking. So we have 28 countries in this category, or (all OECD countries except for Poland, Turkey, Hungary, Greece, Chile and Mexico): [
\----&gt; Note that some of these countries have lower minimum wage than $300 a month (yes I am winking at you Turkey). Not savings rate, actual full blown wage and yet we gracefully count their entire population in our subset!
\- **To make it even simpler let's count all the OECD population and we are looking at 1.3 billion people**, even after all these stretches we had. We are making up for the rich of other countries who can afford this by counting poor of all these countries instead, and even than the cap does not far exceed 1 billion.

Not sure why \`good\` was in quotation there. **Consistent** 5% post-inflation growth is actually quite good. It would have the doubling time of 14.2 years, making it 8x your original investment in 42 years (good time frame between one starts working till they retire), and 4-8x on anything for the next 14.2 years, then 2-4x on anything the next etc. Definitely enough even with low savings rate. If somebody guaranteed 5% return on my USD account today I would put 80% of my net worth without a second to think about it.
Also a typical good investment is generally benchmarked on S&amp;P500, which since 1957 is roughly has average annual return of 8% and inflation adjusted return of 5%, and that is probably where your number is coming from. Problem with that is that "average annual return" doesn't mean consistent or reliable. We might as well hit a Japan\~like stagnation or even a downward economic disaster like never seen before, making S&amp;P500 not necessarily consistent and thus not risk-free. Still it is the best you get around here for retirement savings.

The keyword here is 'unmined'. Just like in oil, just because one has reserves doesn't mean they are available (look at Venezuela's oil reserves and the extraction cost, then look at Iraq's oil reserves and extraction cost for reference\*). As of mid 2018 (last I checked) mining+purifying costs of Gold was just a hundred dollars short of its' market price (on troy oz). On top of that you cannot mine gold instantly, it is a quite slow process so that increase of 8.45% you mention is likely spread over decades (look at existing gold mines that have been active and still not depleted for such a long time).
That is why people refer to real inflation rate, that is the increase of the stock (minus the flow/use/loss).
\* Venezuela has close to 300 billion barrel oil reserves mostly in deepsea where extraction is hard and costly (generally above $70 per barrel even after sunk cost), wherein Iraq only has 140 billion barrel oil reserves but extraction is less than $15 per barrel so they pump it really hard as much as they can.

And that is totally fine by them, since they are not losing much. Even in the off chance that Bitcoin goes to 10 million per coin, they can just choose to buy then and it would literally have no impact on their livelihood.
Instead if they try to buy now it will only complicate their life as they have to give away their KYC details to some exchange (don't get me started with Bisq, no billionaire will deal with that) and transfer some money etc. The amount they put in is nowhere near worth the effort and risk they would be taking.

Exactly what they do with their USD, use it to balance import/export gap by purchasing their needs in Bitcoin. \`Would there be sellers accepting Bitcoin\` is the bigger question imho. I.e. top imports of Iran are cars, car-parts, rice, corn and electronics/chips they cannot produce. Sellers of these can be exposed if they do it in large quantities using Bitcoin and therefore be brought to court by American justice system, so the premiums must be much higher, which in return would make Iran second guess if Bitcoin is preferable to its' alternatives (i.e. physical gold).

Never did, never plan to do :). Would be crazy happy if it does, but I do not believe in fortune telling. In fact I would be pretty happy if outperforms my other retirement investments (i.e. the 5% year-over-year gain the post I replied to mention as a disappointing rate).


Exactly, I do not claim S&amp;P500 is guaranteed at any point. If anything it is highly correlated with VTSAX anyways. The only thing I claimed is that "**consistent 5% post-inflation gain is really good**". The harsh reality is that no such investment opportunity exists with any guarantee. The best you can get with some sort of a guarantee is TIPS bonds (and even that has the extremely unlikely risk of US government going bankrupt), which has close to no real returns.

Kardashev scale's most important aspect is NOT how much energy we generate/use over known solutions, but to that there is a direct correlation between identifying the "next level of energy source" and the civilization's technological advancement.

Any form of sound money is bound to be used by the rich; that is only natural. This is because people should be able to convert any form of wealth into this new form of money, and naturally those who are already rich have the most to convert.
Plus there is nothing new here, they already have many mechanisms to hide their wealth oversees.

Because it is too good to be true, and it generally is.
Keyword here is "generally". The reason being, these kinds of returns are likely during early adoption phases, and by the time average Joe like me hears it it would already be adapted quite into its' middle ages. This is because such returns cannot be sustainable forever since exponential growth would outpace the amount of resources available eventually.
So it is totally reasonable to refuse the idea of some asset reliably give 10x return in such a short period of time. Bitcoin however is a bit exceptional, in the sense that the target audience is actually incredibly big, and the penetration into this audience is not yet addressed (assuming this target would be interested), therefore there can still be room for another 50x growth over the next few decades if things go right. That being said Bitcoin will also reach saturation at some point (and it might already have, though I believe the opposite). The thing is, you won't know it is saturated until it is too late and then it will become mainstream and therefore stable.

Well the good thing is, enabling SegWit is completely up to the exchange, and since exchanges cover most of the transfer cost in general it would be in their best interest to do so when the fees spike.

If you cannot afford 1, it means 1 bitcoin is a lot of money for you, meaning if reaches the moon it will mean equally more. What matters here is the ratio, not the amount. If Bitcoin were to go 10x 1 bitcoin still might not mean much to a San Francisco citizen (not even enough for a down payment) but would mean an entire house for someone living in a third world country.
What I am saying is that you should measure it as the percentage of your net worth, not the amount. If you are holding 5% of your networth in Bitcoin and it goes 20x you would be doubling your net worth. This could be 1 bitcoin for a SanFran person, or 0.01 Bitcoin for someone from Kirkuk.

There are multiple things different in this situation, but one of the most important is that the debt driven economies are closely tied. For instance a very large part of US debt is owned by Japan/China, but they themselves are in great debt, which is partially owned by US. When you add in all world economies things get less scarier.
In your analogy it would be something like you owing $320,000 in various credit cards to banks, but the same banks somehow are owing you $240,000 worth of other equities where they make small payments each month, therefore technically your debt is much smaller since you have passive income from the debt they owe you.
The other part is the collateral. US debt is backed by the country, and therefore it's economy, which can be squeezed whenever necessary if things get hairy. Easy way to do that can be printing money so that US can devalue its' own citizens cash while lowering its' effective debt, but that is not the only way. You can make trade agreements, you can give capitulation, heck you can even rent-for-30-years or sell parts of your country's resources (see Africa).

I am assuming you are referring to the IMF proposal (working paper). If so the difference is that governments can treat the two differently and apply different rates if necessary. To understand why and how you should read the paper, but here is my summary:
\- We are in an era of negative interest rates (in EU it already started where anybody who has substantial amount of cash has to pay to keep it in the banks - at this point mostly corporations, since the limit is quite high-)
\- Problem with the above is that if this imposed limit gets lowered (which already started in some countries like Netherlands) then people can always withdraw it and keep it as physical cash. This would definitely lower the amount available to banks, thus lowers the loans they can give out almost 10-20x depending on the reserve requirement laws of the country.
\- Instead you introduce eEuro, eUSD and peg the cash to these. So even if the individual keeps it as physical cash, you can change the peg value (i.e. physical USD is now worth 0.98 eUSD), to disincentives them to keep it out of banks.
This is a very crude summary, but should address the basics.

That doesn't really make it a great argument though, since nobody is forced to (and would be) keeping their proceeds in fiat anyways. How many of our grandfathers kept the money they earned 100 years ago in the bill form they received? You get your pie's worth, and put it into something that does not lose value (i.e. gold, land, real-estate, investment etc) and when the time comes turn that back into fiat again, which holds its' value and even appreciates.
Technically you are still investing into deflationary stuff, only using fiat temporarily to make exchanges easy. If that is the case inflation can easily be represented by the lowering denominator of the medium in question (i.e. bread costing less and less bitcoins every passing year) and you can accomplish the same goal.

On top of that consider more power efficient mining equipment, cheaper energy alternatives etc etc. It is a very real possibility (though I do not think it would happen) that price to produce Bitcoins would still stay around these amounts even after June 2020.

Well I definitely am not in prediction game and cannot say how realistic that is. Perhaps even millions can happen. My problem with above statement is that it suggests Bitcoin market cap with be many times of all assets today, which is clearly not possible unless USD turns into Bolivar, in which case denominating BTC in that currency makes no sense anyways.


With targeted inflation rate of 2% (and bear in mind we cannot match it all the time and has been lower than that many times last decade), 20 years would make today's $100 into $148 (100\*1.02\^20), so 20 year later millionaire will be having $675k of today's value. If we aim for 2 million number they would be millionaires in today's pricing.

Yet they each have their own private databases. Can Mastercard attest (or have any reason to) to a Visa transaction? The trust I am talking about is between these partners, i.e. Uber to ensure Facebook is not cheating etc. If all were to be in a private Facebook database who could ensure that Facebook is not printing money without even getting the funds from its' users?

S/he is probably trying to get the next block, which can cost around 40-45 Satoshi per byte in today's fees. A 400-600 byte transaction is not unheard of, 200 is definitely very common.
Of course if you do not care about urgency and have enough time to wait you can get it done for 2-3 satoshi per byte as well, which I assume is what you are doing since otherwise 500 sat is very low fee for a transaction.

The only way to force innovation is to put pressure and a clock on finding solutions to the upcoming problems, otherwise it will never get prioritized and be solved properly.
Troubling times are bad for short term, but good in making people desperately looking for solutions. Without such times we would not have Segwit, LN etc. Look at the dark periods where there was no pressure and how little Bitcoin improved compared to last 2 years.

You joke but there are collectible items which retain their value and even increase manyfold, not sure if these beanie babies are one of those.
The general issue with collectibles is that there needs to be a process to be able to confirm their "limitedness". If some entity today can replicate one for the price of X where no authority can confirm or deny their authenticity, by default the perceived value of this item shall not be too variant from X. If on the other hand this item is irreplaceable (i.e. are numbered like limited edition Playstations etc) or are very hard to remake (i.e. certain types of cars where their factories and parts are long expired and remaking them requiring setting up entire factories, making them very expensive to replace) then the value can be anything.

This is very messy data to drive any conclusions to begin with due to:
\- the many-to-one relationships of wallets to a person
\- the one-to-many relationship of an exchange wallet to people
This phenomenon thus can be explained by many potential developments:
1. A natural development of the 2017 craze finally fading out and the weak hands selling their coins from exchanges can explain it, since this would mean some of the top addresses losing the total crypto held in their wallets
2. Exchanges continuously increasing the number of cold storage they have and distributing the coins to mitigate the risk of hacking, which in return also increases this metric
3. New investors in crypto who had the old money due to late 2018 stock developments (i.e. some of the rich folks finally decide to diversify their 3-5% holdings into crypto currency)
4. Hodlers not buying new coins and thus the mined coins going to bottom 90th percentile of wallets (though I would like to believe this is not true)
5. ...
I can count 50 other reasons why this might have happened, and plenty of them does not let you drive the conclusion this "Head of Data Science" guy did, so I am really curious where their confidence in what this means comes from.

Theoretically you are right, but the general way of working around tariffs usually don't work because the world banking system abides the rules, these also include embargo/sanctions.
For instance, before 2016 there was major nuclear sanctions on Iran, and no self respecting country or private corporation who has ties with US or EU banks could trade with them, because that would make these countries markets inaccessible to them. Instead, countries like India/Turkey etc had a workaround and started paying Iran directly in gold, where no SWIFT code needed to be exchanged and no direct global trace was necessary (internal banks of said countries had some documents that got exposed). In this scenario, Bitcoin can easily replace gold like u/boatsmhoes is questioning, likely in a much easier fashion since transferring gold is a hard task.

Nobody needs that much money. You just need a sliver of a slice to be crazy rich. Anybody who can time travel should do the following:
\- Start mining but never exceed 5% of the hash power at any point in time (perhaps with the exception of the time Hal Finney and Satoshi did by themselves)
\- Once people put a price on it, DCA with a reasonable daily limit (say $5 at first (which gets you 250 Bitcoin per day, merely noticable from the 50\*24\*5 bitcoins created at the time), and try to keep buying 250 Bitcoins all the way to $11 price range
\- Wait for the first bubble and sell most of your holdings around $100\~ish range without actually holding a large stake of the coins, then buy from $30 and hodl for a few years
\- Repeat the above stage for the next 4 years ...
And bam! You are at least worth $200 million, congratulations.
But then again, if you have time travel powers and willing to wait 8 years, just get the winning PowerBall numbers one week before the $800 jackpot and you can do it all in under a day.

1. Trezor's code is open sourced while Ledger's is not. This might or might not matter though since there is no guarantee the binary inside your device is compiled through what is open sourced or a modified version of it. Trust to these companies play a big role there.
2. Ledger allows a wider spectrum of altcoins. If you only care about Bitcoin and famous variants Trezor is enough though.
3. Ledger operates over its' own app (Ledger Live), which in some cases can be safer (i.e. phishing attacks) but in others not.
4. Their UI intereaction screen size is different. Some people like to see the whole address they are sending/receiving rather than a moving window.
All in all both are pretty safe as long as you buy it from the original source. Do not buy from a middle man!

I know this is not what people want to hear, but for those who plan to trade on the short term this is a logical behavior, albeit riskier. 
When you see consistent climbing, you expect to surf the wave and hope to jump out of the board before it hits the beach. The more imbalance on buy over sell rate (which reflects in price) the more people would believe that it is a high demanding product, thus would like to buy so that they can sell it to next buyer for a higher price. The only problem is, when the demand runs out of steam you will be forced to get rid of it as quickly as possible, like the game of hot-potato. 
There are tons of "traders" who made lots of money riding Bitcoin from 7K to 16K (not even the early adapters, the very late comers) using this strategy. Many also lost because they held the hot potato.
But again, this only concerns for short term traders. If you believe in the product and can wait for years, this should not concern you at all, since you are not trying to time the market.

But price is an indicator of the slice Bitcoin has in our financial system. A tool that (at the very maximum) can transfer less than $100B globally can be nothing but a minuscule part of the system. Unless it reaches to represent $10+ trillion it is very susceptible to be manipulated and cannot establish large enough position. In other words unless Bitcoin reaches $400,000-$500,000 range we cannot really call it an important part of the financial system, and would just be calling it a fringe asset. Whether it will see those valuations or not is another question.

The sell dates are exactly 4 years after\*, so the sharpest increase/decrease would only show in the single dates - 4 years in this scenario, which are already captured in the high peaks and low bottoms of the chart. If you look at general trend it is almost always over 1 (meaning 10\^1, so 10x+ increase).
\* to give an example of 12-17-2017 of price $19.738 would only reflect on ratio of the price on 12-17-2013 date here, while 22-12-2017 price of $13,800 would impact the ROI with respect to 22-12-2013 date price in the same chart. So do get rid of the peak/bottom effect all we have to look at the general rate of return in most days, which is above 1.

@_date: 2019-12-19 18:41:08
The reason why 3 years is considered safe haven (for some people at least) is because historically you can never be underwater for any period longer than 3 years. Not saying it is anything special, it just happens to be that way.
This however can be tied to your halving cycles logic because the 4 year cycles people talk of actually cover 1 year bear market, 2 year sideways with slow climb until ATH is reached once more, and 1 year bull, making any 3 year window profitable.
@_date: 2019-12-18 17:08:19
Not original poster but from the first chart if his "0.226" magic ratio were to hold the next halving bottom would actually be 88% of the previous one, so it gets lower to sth like $11,050, as for the ATH it narrows to 328%, making it 462K.

Sure it can be used for verifying if an individual voted or not, I was not focusing on that since the main problem with voting fraud is generally about misallocating the ballot to the fraudster party.
I suppose this can be good to catch if same individual tries to vote multiple times, though with current systems and register on single voting location that should practically be preventable already, so I am not sure I see the merit in using blockchain for it still.
The other issue is that you should not be able to vote remotely where someone else has access to see your ballot, so technically you need to be in the voting cubicle by yourself physically anyways, which further diminishes the use of blockchain imho.

Those are generally accounted for in these estimations. Basically high percentage of wallets that had no spend in the last 5 year window is assumed to be lost in these guesstimates. Old timers told me that especially before 2013 taking care of your wallet was hard (DAT files etc) but after 2014 it became pretty hard to lose your wallet as long as you took necessary simple precautions.
That being said we know some early accounts are not lost but in their nesting period. I.e. Hal Finney himself wrote before he passed away (who most likely had a huge load) that his coins are safe and secured to be passed onto his children and will be unlocked after a time period.

The point of the impact is not the absolute amount itself, but the time frame since the supply cut is eternal that point onwards, making it only a matter of time. Sure it won't be a huge impact for a few months, but looking at it in the long run (assuming demand increase rate is stable) eventually it will overcome the balance, making the lack of supply for the lower prices. This is why most people think you see price skyrocketing 9-18 months after the halvening itself.
@_date: 2019-12-31 04:27:38
Yes but that has nothing to do with the main point delivered here. Price can be effected by many things, but when considering impact of a single variable you fix all other (considering correlations as well) and measure afterwards only on the variant.
@_date: 2019-12-24 02:02:07
Possibly yes, but we do not know it yet. It indeed did all this during the global bull market, but we do not even know if these were strongly correlated. It might just be an uncorrelated (or very low correlated) asset for all we know. 
Also, say it is strongly correlated to global bull markets. We do not know when this global bull market might end. Reputable people have been predicting its' end since 2014\*, so it might not be crazy that it survives another 2-3 years, which would still cover the same scenario underlined in Bitcoin's history.
FWIW Bitcoin has seen winters (almost every few years), just not one that overlaps with global recession as you underlined. I am also curious how it would react to one.

Define Bubble carefully my friend. Just because something raise in value very quickly does not mean it is a bubble. Google stock rose in value fairly quickly (turning $10m valued company into its' $850b current version), but it is not a bubble but through insane growth it observed. Similar things can be said for Amazon or say automative industry a century ago, steam engine industry 2 centuries ago etc etc.
Good examples to bubbles are Dutch Tulip Mania, South Sea Company, 1920 Florida Real Estate Bubble etc etc. 
Whether Bitcoin is a bubble or not I cannot say, but to me it looks more like Google/Amazon because it's rise in value is directly correlated with the growth and security of its' network. To others it might look more like Tulip Mania where supply is artifically kept low while there is a lack of inherent value.

If there is hyperinflation, then the market prices w.r.t. USD or Euro would also inflate just as much (similar to high inflation of 80s).

Sounds like a problem of where you are getting your bitcoin (and the respective fee charges) rather than the appreciation of the coin itself.
For reference there are exchanges that charge 0.1-0.15% or less for a transaction. For your example it would have costed you 2-3 cents to buy and 2-3 cent to sell for $20-30 dollar transaction, all of the rest would have been profit.

You could see the demand back in 2012 too and it was teeny tiny, but most people could not anticipate 40+ million active users readily meeting the demand of paying a months worth of income for a single bitcoin day in day out.
Maybe s/he thinks there would be 800 million people actively trying to buy it month to month while the available new coins per day is 900 or 450 (depending on the time frame) per block while many hodlers not selling, and anticipates the balance price point there.

Because the liquidity of Bitcoin is also a function of the price. There is a reason why only limited amount of Bitcoin is available for trade, and that is because owners of other coins are not ready to part with their holdings at these prices. When price rise quickly, so does the amount of Bitcoin suddenly flooding the exchanges, which in return depresses the prices since demand does not catch up immediately.

Yes, because I am not putting all my eggs in the same basket. Sure if I put all my money (excess of minimum living expenses) into Bitcoin and then it went 20x I could retire in a LCOL area, but that is nothing short of gambling. I am keeping Bitcoin as 5% of my portfolio as it is a high risk asset, and if it goes 20x what it would do in best case is to double my stack, which significantly helps towards retirement but does not get me there. Even if I put 10% it would only triple, still long way from retirement, and honestly putting 10% of your whole net worth in any single asset is not a good idea (barring the apartment you live in).
What my friend had was roughly this, she allocated 10% of all her net worth into Bitcoin and cashed out after 40x. I am saying such a thing is much more unlikely today.

First of all I am commenting on your argument that "it is named a COIN so it has to be a currency not a commodity".
Second, golds' use in technology is quite small w.r.t. its' stock. If you want to see how the stock of minerals that have their value come from technology looks like, take a look at Lithium, Palladium etc where their production solely depends on their consumption/use. Majority of the gold is not used today, it is "stored". You can actually validate this since gold has been a commodity for millenniums, but its' use in technology is fairly recent so clearly its' value is not deriving from it.

Today even the minimum wage provides you shelter, electricity, music, movies ... you don't starve to death, eat meat at least once a week, enjoy things even the kings of the past could not have. This is all despite how terrible the income equality is, all thanks to technology.

In your analogy, if US was a person he would also have about 19T to collect from other folks he owes to\*. 22T is not net debt, if everybody were to clear off their ledger we would be left sth like a 3T, which is not too hard to pay off within a decade using proper austerity politics. This however is a terrible thing to do since the austerity will clearly hit the GDP very majorly, thus no country is attempting to do this. Debt after all is just an entry in the ledger until resolved.

For a 26 yr old, that is not bad. Assuming you were actively working since 22 that means you have been saving at this rate for 4 years, so 50% of your liquids at the very best would mean 2 years of savings going south for you. If it vanishes tomorrow, all it does it to postpone your retirement few more years.
Now imagine being 42, and that you have been working/saving for 20 years. All of a sudden your net worth has to be put in much risk-free assets, because losing your investments means you have to retire at 87 instead of 67.
This is why risk is relative to the age when it comes to investment.

I guess it depends why dollar is losing its' value. If it is losing it just because central bank is simply printing more you are right, but if it is losing its' value because US economy is in ruins that means people are losing their jobs, losing their purchase power and cutting out any non-survival items. 
In such a case house prices won't hold their value for instance as many people would either stop paying their mortgages or end up selling their house, thus flooding the market with foreclosures and houses for sale. Similarly if people are losing their purchase power many equities will also see downfall since companies sales numbers will drop and they will stop profiting etc etc.

2 million lower bound is actually pretty legit, since it mainly focuses on bitcoin UTXO from 2009-2011 and have not been "spent" (even after many major events). Most estimations look at 5 year rolling window and the amount of coins from this period has been stable for quite a while. Note that until 2011 extremely few number of people were aware that Bitcoin can rise meteorically, thus proper measures to secure one's private keys was not common. By the end of 2011, when Bitcoin hit $33 people realized shit is real, and most folks started taking "security" seriously.
With the 4 million upper-bound however I have many reservations. It mainly relies on the "unspent" addresses from 2011-2014, which is the period people were already aware of the potential of Bitcoin, so imho they can just be "Believers" who will not sell for a long long time. There are also burn addresses and such but the rate of those things are minuscule in these comparisons.
Anecdote time: I actually have a friend from work who mined 126 Bitcoins in his lab desktop during early period (just for fun, he was just interested in the idea) during grad school, and around late 2010 when he defended his thesis he totally forgot about backing up his drive. Apparently the school has wiped it out by the time he realized his mistake. During 2017 boom, this was almost a daily topic in our workplace, on how he threw away "few hundred thousand (which later became 2+ million)". He is just one of the many such examples to the fact that, early period many people saw this thing as an experimental fun project and nothing more.

If I knew that, I would be 100% in Bitcoin, throwing everything I have on that, but I don't know that do I?


Losing 5% of my net worth won't ruin my life, it would just mean I threw away roughly one year of my life away, but I can live with that. Losing 50% of my net worth (from today's standards) would be catastrophic though.
The soundest pillar of investment has always been "diversification". Even holding 5% of my savings in a single asset feels a bit too much to me, but I do it because I believe in a future with Bitcoin. I would not however risk years of my hard work, sweat and tears into Bitcoin for the off-chance that it will hit jackpot, that is just not who I am.

Coincidentally that would make a portion of today's \`die hard hodler\`s to flood the market with their long kept coins, putting downwards pressure on the price.

It looks like it is going the safer route and overestimating the fees. I.e. as I am writing this there are 17,400\~ unconfirmed transactions paying fee 50+ satoshi per byte, and with estimated 2200 transactions per block, 50 sat should make it within 8 blocks if the volume trend keeps the same, yet your estimation is giving  83 sat/byte for 12 blocks (on Standard, which I assume meaning you expect the volume trend to stay the same).
Could it be that your approach is more sensitive towards spikes (i.e. today there is quite a bit of buy pressure with relatively higher volume)? I think you can have a regression line normalizing w.r.t. this condition.

Forgive my intrusion but does it have to be this exact transaction, or what matters is the amount to be transacted to that particular address?

The thing is though, the voting power is coming from miners not holders. So if miners were to be sure that Bitcoin price wouldn't take a huge hit (i.e. halve) they would be OK with a proposal of the block reward to double. Doubling block reward wouldn't inflate all Bitcoins in existence to double so it is unlikely the price would halve, yet their reward would easily make up for any other level of price cut. This would effectively be similar to FED printing money, like a forced inflation on every coin holder today.
What I described above is unlikely to happen because nobody benefits from trust to Bitcoin diminishing ... now. Not sure how it would play out 4 halvings later though and how greedy the miners would get at that point.

Despite all the QE from 2008, US is still the most reliably out of all world powers.

How do you spend it then? Say I received $20 from my friend and gave her a new address. I need to spend that in a single transaction later (and make sure not much is left while trying to estimate the fees). So If I have to send another friend $12, it is definitely not ideal to use this since I would have to use the address again later making it re-used ...

Ah, I think I misunderstood and mistook \`address\` for wallet.

It was just too convenient to save the address to my exchange and keep sending it.

Even the next block fee is 83 cents. I am not sure which software you are using to help estimate the cost but I think it is over-pricing you. I generally put it around or below 20 satoshi per byte (roughly 25 cents right now) if I want to do it relatively quickly, and 2-5 sat per byte if the amount of transaction is very small. So far I have never experienced any issues with it.

Yet Gold is the 5th most popular central bank reserve in the world following USD, EUR, Sterling and JPY\*. The reason for this is because you do not actually have to move the gold and as you mentioned you can exchange paper gold (since most countries gold reserves lie in either London or New York).
\* Gold's share of forex reserves by country: [
The reason why it appears to be not used globally as a medium of exchange is because it is first converted into USD or EUR before transactions. It is otherwise very heavily used and transacted. I.e. if you look at most distressed countries reserves they liquidate their gold reserves to suppress the loss of their own currency. It is also a good medium of exchange if you want to defy some embargo like Iran did few years ago.

\`Non-Hodl\`ed coins are not a fixed supply, they are a function of the bitcoin price (to some extent). There are many people who hodl their coins until it reaches to an \`unreasonable\` price. For some that is $8k, $16k, $20k, $25k etc. As soon as the price reaches those levels available (read as liquid) coins in the market rises until it is consumed by other hodl'lers with higher \`unreasonable\` limit.
@_date: 2019-04-22 22:09:04
Great points, though I think those items are highly correlated. No large organization is using Bitcoin because it is not liquid enough, which in turn causes it to be unstable and easy to swing with small amounts of cash either direction, which loops back in and prevents it to be used in global transactions. This however does not have to be the case in the long run. Just one of these issues stabilizing could mean all three to be resolved. I do agree with the sentiment though that I cannot see this happening in the near future.
Also just because it can have these properties does not mean it will be used as a reserve currency. There are plenty of things that meet these 3 criteria (i.e. many precious metals) that just are not reserve currencies because the alternatives already meet the demand. There has to be some need for it to have the push for Bitcoin becoming yet another reserve currency. I.e. if there was a country that had precious resources everybody wanted (like Oil) and is only willing to trade via Bitcoin, then I can see world monetary organizations keeping it as a reserve, but I just do not see any realistic application of that sort yet.
@_date: 2019-04-22 21:57:17
I just cannot wrap my head around on how around the world central banks would hold some amount of Bitcoin as their reserve. It is just so easy to steal by individuals in a corrupt government, and let's face it there are dime a dozen of those all around the world. When multiple people (entire country and bunch of banks in this instance) were to share ownership of Bitcoin, it feels like it would be so much harder to navigate on it.
Think about Russia for instance. Today no matter how many steps of security you setup, if Putin wants those private keys he will get them. Who is to stop him?
Even for gold plenty of countries do not trust their own security and keep their gold in London or New York, and we are talking about billions and billions of dollars worth Bitcoin here.

The thing is, Bitcoin does not need to fully replace the traditional money schemes that function today, it just can be an alternative with taking a %5-10 of the pie (in the very long run).
We already observe people keeping large amounts of cash in their "savings" accounts with returns much lower than the inflation. We already see people investing into 30 year treasury bonds that actually have minimal returns. These do not power the economy in any direct way, and can be better utilized if kept in a deflationary powerhouse, provided it is stable.
I know some people want to see USD/Euro to die and everybody living off of cryptocurrencies, but honestly that sounds like a wet dream of an extreme libertarian. More realistic case is fiat&amp;crypto being alive together, one fueling the debt and growth cycle while other provides a safe haven for the savers with 'non-consuming mindset'.

The thing is there are many assets that protect people from inflation, such as real-estate, inflation adjusted CDs (TIPS), municipal bonds etc etc.
So even though inflation gives a rise in crypto price it doesn't necessarily make it buy more stuff thanks to it on average. What makes the crypto purchase power higher is increasing demand, which would at some point in the future would have to stagnate. At that point crypto won't be too different than other inflation 'protected' assets mentioned above. This imho is a good thing but not everyone will like it.

For your first point: the way bitcoin helps is that they park their excess cash into something that should raise in value as adoption grows, so 10-20 years down the road they have the bigger share of the financial pie of the world.
As for the good vs bad debt;
Well there are two kinds of debt. One that is financially beneficial to you in the long run, and the other basically putting a useless ball and chain on your ankle. Let me clarify:
Good debt  getting a mortgage while interest rates are low so after 5+ years you are paying into your mortgage less than you would have paid for rent in the same location, all the while contributing to raise your ownership of said house.
Bad debt  Instead of buying a reliably decent 2nd hand car with your $9,000, you decide to get a loan of $75,000 so you can drive that neat Tesla Model S using your $9,000 as down payment and keep paying every month for the next 6 years. At the end of the 6 years they both end up doing the same task (taking you from point A to point B) while one easily costs you over $35-40K depreciation and other only few thousand dollars. The merits of Tesla obviously exist but I'm talking about the financial aspects of the choice here.
Good debt  You are good at what you do as a salaried employee and know that you can make your industry much better if only you had your own company to have a saying in things that matter. You take a business loan for your startup to create value and use the money for next 5 years to build a sustainable business that should last for decades to come.
Bad debt  You take out the home equity loan from your house (since its' value appreciated) so that you can buy the all new jacuzzi you always wanted, renovate the kitchen and buy appliances etc, which almost certainly will lose most of their value 10 years down the road when you are selling your house.
etc etc.
@_date: 2019-01-29 18:54:39
This assumes the whole world eventually will adapt Bitcoin, since the chart is supposed to be normalized by the whole group. I.e. "internet users" today are about 4 billion people, so first 80 million users could be considered innovators, though in the future it would probably reach to 7 billion and innovator count would go to 140 million.
This brings up the next big question, what will be the adoption count of Bitcoin in say 5 or 10 years? As it stands, estimated 45 million people are using bitcoin (hard to say due to 1 person many wallet vs 1 wallet many person like exchanges), so currently only first 900,000 people are in the innovator category and about next 5 million are early adopters. This certainly makes sense since you can also see most innovators and early adopters already got enough bitcoin to last them a lifetime.
Say for someone who got into bitcoin today, 45 millionth adopter, to be considered an early adopter needs to be in the 15th percentile so we need 300 million Bitcoin active Bitcoin users to reach that level. For him/her to be considered innovator 2.5th percentile requires about roughly 2 billion people to be active Bitcoin users. When do you think we would reach there? 5 years, 10 years, 15 years? 
Interesting chart and way to look at things regardless though, thanks for sharing.

You are right that "marketcap" is not a necessary statistic to value Bitcoin, but a \`complete\` statistic in terms of justifying its' volatility. I tried to touch upon why I think this way when I was responding to another comment here: [ 
In other words, it is easy to raise the Bitcoin price to $50,000 per Bitcoin by just injecting $10B in a few months making "marketcap" $875B, but it is not realistic to keep it at that value without pumping more money since as soon as that $10B dries out demand won't be balancing the "profit taking".
@_date: 2019-01-15 21:37:50
I think you are missing my point. I am not comparing 1 million compared to todays prices, like the 20K was to $100 few years ago. I am talking about a global cap.
Look at my paragraph w.r.t. growth slowing. It is not the same thing to make adoption of 100 units into 20,000 units vs making 3,000 units into 1,000,000 units if the amount of buyers in both situation is relatively same. Facebook grew from $500,000 valuation to $20,000,000 (40x) in a matter of few years, yet spend 6 years to raise the 100B to 400B (4x), because underlying market cap of number of available humans to have an account and see ads were limited and harder to grow.
Or think of it like this, you get 1800 coins mined everyday and if all be sold as soon as they were acquired from todays prices of (3-4K per coin) you need about $7M of new money apart from all other bitcoin transactions to happen, yet if it were to be 1 million \*today\* you would have to have $1.8B to new money to be spent every single day. Did the underlying fact of \*total available money\* in the world change in this scenario? of course not. So you have to have orders of magnitude higher adoption to even keep this price range afloat. Eventually this growth stops, since you cannot add more and more forever (similar to Facebook example).

Not to burst your bubble, but technically you are paying for it, it is just blended in to your total. If you think about it the vendor who is selling you the stuff has to pay Visa/Mastercard a particular fee per transaction, and clearly that adds to their cost. Unless they are willing to cut from margins (which are razor thin in most retail anyways) they are basically putting that amount to your bill by raising the prices of the items. On top of that they also do not get the cash for another 30 days and they also lose from that point as well, which also reflect to you as an additional cost.
This is why many mom&amp;pop stores can technically be willing to sell you stuff cheaper if you are willing to pay in cash (assuming they are not doing it for the purposes of tax fraud).

I just look at it as a way of diversifying my investments for her, only unlike stocks adoption of Bitcoin is way too early so anything I buy now can easily outweigh whatever I can buy over a long time period (i.e. $1000 worth of bitcoin in 2013 could never have been bought by todays standards like monthly purchases). 
Of course this doesn't mean I rely on Bitcoin for my child's future. I will still invest in traditional legs of the economy (like stocks, bonds etc) but I am fully comfortable putting this seed money in Bitcoin and not looking back.

The go to 7% mark is generally used for dividend reinvested avg return minus the expected inflation of 3-4% (which looks slighly larger than it is nowadays  due to 80s hyperinflation era).
Over that 7% most people take away 2.5-3% out of it for tax purposes (being conservative) and come up with the "safe 4% withdrawal rate", which is also known as The Trinity Study. Their numbers might be a bit outdated now but should still be close to the rounded up numbers above.
Yeah I am really curious about how Bitcoin return rate will be too. 10 years is nothing when it comes to an ageless investment, and Bitcoin seems to be at its' infancy. Will it rise and shine like IBM did back in the day as the jewel of blue chip stocks, or give its' top spot to a competitor like Yahoo! did. Who can tell? We shall wait and see :)

True but there is no proof comparatively that Bitcoin will be gaining over fiat. I believe it will, but there is no proof.
There are however inflation adjusted investment options with almost\* %100 reliability to not lose money and beat fiat in any day, like TIPS.
\* I say almost because TIPS would only fail if US government ends up not being able to pay its' debt which is unthinkable in todays' standards.

As crazy as it might sound, this is not a bad idea if operated properly.
Not all debt is bad debt when it comes to fiat.
\- Taking out a high loan to drive an expensive car ... bad loan
\- Taking out a mortgage for a stable house price area while interest rates are low to get a fixed good rate before inflation and rates creep up ... pretty good loan.
I know people here hate the banks and think fractional reserves are the upmost evil, but some loans actually good for the economy.
Your debt in fiat will always dwindle down if your interest rate becomes insignificant over time (like mortgages people got decades ago) while you enjoying the item acquired with that debt and lowering your expenses. I.e. those who bought houses in 2010/2011 in my area are paying less in mortgage than what people like me pay for rent today, while owning the property in the long run. They use the excess money others spend on rent to buy things like Bitcoin or stocks.

I do not expect the appreciation of the scale it happened over the last 8 years, but 17.5 years is a long time, so 100X is not totally out of question, which would hopefully be enough to make her pay a big portion of her college fees.

While you are completely right on them having the freedom to do as they please and choose, following nasty tactics make them highly susceptible to the critism they receive:
* calling "Bitcoin" as not the real coin and "Bitcoin Cash" as the real thing
* using the domain "bitcoin\[dot\]com" to push their own agenda while using the "Bitcoin" name
* trying to use their power to use underhanded tactics trying to hurt Bitcoin and try to trick people into moving their side
I do not think they would be treated this way if they did what every other coin did and came up with their own alt-coin without trying to poison Bitcoin.
Also, it is funny to see "appealing to authority" logical fallacy in a movement that is the very definition of anti-authority and full support of decentralization. I don't think OP was trying to do so but I agree with you that some people take the white paper as Bible of Bitcoin. Let's be honest, Satoshi could not have calculated every development that has happened and will happen and the community is free to change the direction or improve the technology, which is by his/her design in the first place. 
@_date: 2019-01-28 19:05:44
What most people miss out is that "markets are efficient". And yes, this includes Bitcoin too.
If everybody knows that halving will lower the supply on date D which will push the prices higher, then they can choose to buy it on date 'D-1day' to profit, but hey others can anticipate that and buy it on date 'D-2days' ... all the way to 'D-400days' or 'D-4000days', with the only downside of holding it longer and thus spreading the risk. This should normally mean that the 'rally' we expect supposably be happening way before and the impact is already baked in.
Here is a good example, ignore the next halving, we already know that 'next-next' having will have it even higher, so why not buy it today and keep it for the next 6 years? If we do then we already included our optimism into the price for 2024 today!
Now at sample of 3, heck even at sample of 10 you can see patterns and associate them into single event. This is how human mind works, but honestly there are million other reasons why Bitcoin price can rise or sink and we have no proof that above chart has happened due to this event, which OP also states in his post.

Well what your first point is mostly addressed by not keeping much in hot wallets and only move some money from cold wallets when necessary. This is mostly due to security concerns but also helps adjusting the 'privacy' issues you are underlining.
Another thing to note is that you can have as many addresses as you want with your bitcoin spread however you like. Even if they use some graph traversal algorithms to figure out the transaction history between those addresses they can never be sure that those are yours. There are many people with hundreds of addresses with less than 0.5 bitcoin in them and they keep groups of such addresses isolated enough that it cannot be tracked. I do not see this being a necessity for most folks since trying to erase your footprint this hard is mostly used to avoid legal stuff, but it is nice to know there are ways around it. There are even privacy coins where you can convert your Bitcoin into and out of and make it pretty much impossible to be traced.

Imho 21 bitcoin is already too much. I'm nowhere near that amount, but anything above 21 sounds a bit greedy to me (no offense to your 100 bitcoin goal). If I ever manage to have 21 Bitcoins I will stop there and let others who also need Bitcoin to accumulate.
If you think about it 21 bitcoin will mean there will at most be 1 million people who will have as much as you, and realistically much much less than 1 million since the distribution is nowhere near uniform. The more people hoard, the less the unfortunate will get a chance to accumulate. Imho Bitcoin should be for the commonfolk who got screwed over by the few elites and the banking system, a fighting chance for the workers of the world. If western folks try to buy 100-1000 range that will easily change the balance of the distribution which will make it a lot like today's gini coefficients. If that is the case what is Bitcoin for? Just for the wealthy to exchange their asset class? 
I'm sorry if this offends you but I had to share my two cents on the issue.
@_date: 2019-01-28 22:18:47
That is a pretty weak argument. As I said there can be thousand other reasons why such bullruns would happen, that are much more likely than available supply being cut in half. Even if we were to assume supply/demand is the main factor and bullrun happened due to that (which is the argument for halvening positive impact) increasing demand is certainly much much much higher impact than the supply run going from %4 inflation to %2 inflation, so I do not see how you can confidently pin the positive impact into halvening directly.
Again I am not saying halvening does not have positive impact, I am saying it would be priced in for a reasonable time earlier for most investors.
@_date: 2019-01-21 16:59:36
The issue is that they are actually causing their own people to use this chance to adopt Bitcoin. Think about it, this is almost equivalent of west inventing 'printing press' and Ottomans saying 'nay we do not allow this devil's invention' to prevent their 'handwriting' economy from collapse. This is the chance for the poor part of the world to take a piece of the pie while they can before the boom so that there would at least be some form of proper wealth distribution, and these dictators prevent their people from doing that!

You guys make it sounds like it is so easy to profile some anonymous account into a physical address. Unless u/[Baljourn]( is an amateur who left bread crumbs of his real identity all over his past comments, it is pretty hard to pinpoint someones identity. This is not instagram, facebook etc.
Also even if somebody knew your physical address it is still really hard to steal the bitcoins without committing to serious levels of criminal activities, like breaking into their home, extorting info through torture etc. These things are not as common as movies make them to be.

This is a very informed response and I must admit you are right. Bitcoin is an asset that has not revealed its' every dimension so there are plenty of unknowns. 
That being said I would rather assume that part of the 'latent' aspect of Bitcoin is no longer as strong since it has went over few adoption cycles so far. It is far from reaching its' full adoption cycle but it might not be too hard to model on its' demand growth rate assuming everything going right.
Another good point on future markets providing more predictability on the subject. Kudos!
@_date: 2019-01-05 21:32:45
You are preaching to the quire my friend, but as I said there are traces of truth there. It is a fact that few people hold really large wallets and given the liquidity it can really manipulate the market like the above scare tactic suggests, but you are right that it cannot be used repeatedly (unless the whales create negative/positive sentiment and ride the wave to recollect all the coins they spent, which is not so easy).
Bitcoin is not untraceable anyways, since in today's world it is really hard to spend it all without somewhat turning it into fiat which gives footprint of an identity. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 23:04:54
You are right about the lost coins and guesstimate about the ones in circulation.
As for the 50 coins example, what will the next 50 coins be sold at? What about the next next 50 coins? Will they all sell for 1 million? If not market cap is not 17 trillion. There is a reason why small purchases do not mark the price but the trends are (i.e. after hours purchases vs daily min/max in stock market). I already answered in another comment about this. In 2017 $2B was invested into Bitcoin rapidly that caused the spike to 20K, but clearly it did not stay there, so in the long term Bitcoin market cap did not justify the $340B and today we are sitting at somewhere around $60B (which is the result of many many billions of dollars fueling into it over the last 6+ years). Talking about spikes are not that useful, talking about stable price points are. If we want Bitcoin to be stable around 1 million dollars, at least (ant that is at the very least) 4-5T of investment needs to go into it over a period of time so we do not see immediate sell offs from from people who made bank in the short term.
Let me give you a simple example, say I bought my coin at $1000 today and tomorrow it is worth $100,000 because some crazy billionaire bought 1000 coins with his $100M out of a whim. If I am not a religious HODLer and plan to make money off of it, I know that it is not reasonable for Bitcoin to jump 100x in one day and that it will likely regress. Thus I would sell while I get the chance and wait for a price point cheaper than $100,000, whatever I can get to buy the same amount of coins or more. This is what happens if there is a huge imbalance on the amount of money flowing to a commodity and the market cap of it. Just because some nutjob put $100M for 1000 coins do not make all 17 million coins worth that much, clearly because such a demand cannot be sustainable (i.e. we will not have 17,000 such billionaries waiting around doing this again and again). There will be massive selloffs if the market cap is not justified. This is mostly how bubbles form and burst as can be seen time and time again in the history of markets (Tulipmania to EastIndiaCompany etc).
On the other hand if billons of people from India/China/Malaysia etc started buying bitcoin at every chance they get no matter how small the amount and pour money into Bitcoin market that eventually sums up to trillions of dollars over the years, this will make the demand side higher and will organically raise prices. This is why "narrow money" needs to pour into the Bitcoin market to justify the market cap.
Hope this example clarified my position for you.
@_date: 2019-01-15 19:39:03
Yes you are right, squarefoot function actually incorporates the slowth in growth into the model, which is something I missed. Thank you for pointing it iout.
That being said I feel like the 7 figure price point is supposed to be bounded by the available "narrow money" in the world (which is $37T as of 2017), since Bitcoin does not operate on fractional reserve. I am not finding 7 figure unreasonable because it is so far off from where we are today (which is a big argument for 20K prediction few years ago) but because I do not see the majority of the world banking their reserve savings into Bitcoin. We are talking about 10-12 year frame where none of the boomers or millennials are going away. Them adapting bitcoin and putting half their savings into it just sounds like a dream to me.
I am neither an optimist nor a pessimist and like to describe myself as a realist, so don't get me wrong when I say I find it hard to believe it for this time frame. Give it 2 generations and I can believe that Bitcoin reaching there, even beyond because adoption would be simplified while new generations would have a natural nick for it. My generation on the other hand, even the most technically able bodies find it hard to navigate through cyrpto currencies. Boomers, even worse.

To be honest I do not see us going that direction. Education being free means it needs to be government subsidized. The way we are going is that government is drowning in debt and is trying to cut the cost as much as they can, so the reverse sounds quite unlikely.

I do not think you got my point. What you are referring to is the direct fees the bank applies for the credit card. What I am referring is the indirect fees you pay because of rising vendor cost.
Case 0. Say I run a store selling only item X, for $100 per item. I get the item from wholeseller for $92, and make $8 per item if you buy it using cash. Say on average I sell 1000 of item X per month, so I make $8000 per month. I pay my rent, electricity, insurance cost, tax etc etc which sum up to $5800, and my net profict is $2200. With that 2200 I survive by paying for shelter, eating etc.
Case 1. Enter credit card processing fees. Now I am paying 10 cents + 1.51% per transaction. Assuming some people buy   2+ X occasionally, but most buying a single X say I have about 700 such transactions per month. I am basically paying Visa/Mastercard/Amex $1.61 per such transaction so 700\*1.61=1127. All of a sudden my margin of $2200 went down to $1003 because of this additional expense. What do I do, cut all my survival cost in half and try to live with less money? Maybe if I can afford it. What most people to however is to raise the cost of X to $102. Now all my customers are paying $102, I end up making same amount and credit card companies make money. So my customers are technically paying for the CC.
ELI5: Using CC is not burden free from customer point of view unlike the widespread belief.

As far as I know that quote reflects on "Strong form of EM Theory", which is still heavily debated by the economists. Indeed there is no way to prove that markets are efficient w.r.t. insider information use, in fact the opposite is likely true just like how Buffet suggests. If you look at most of Buffet's original investments they are done after very heavy research in individual companies including getting their accounting books for consideration of acquiring. On top of that he had a network of other industries he controlled where he can utilize the business further or split it apart to make it more efficient. He made most of his money this way, and they are certainly not about leveraging fully publicly available data.
What I am referring above however is a "Weak form of EM Theory" since we are talking about past public information (halving) and its' impact. An information available years ahead of its' time with predictable outcomes (supply change) easily fits into this category.

One of the many issues here is the trust layer. He needs to trust you that you will release the bitcoin, you need to trust him that he won't try to void the transaction as a fraud etc etc. There are solutions to this of course, but not as easy as the way you envision.
An easier way is to open a bank account from another country that do not have to obey these restrictions. I.e. HSBC, Citibank etc both operate in India. If you open your account with origin in India it might be subject to same laws but if you open it while you are traveling, say in New York or London, then transfer your funds from Indian Bank account to that account it should work out. These banks allow foreign internationals to open accounts, and exchanges will accept transfer from these banks. Of course only a small minority of Indian citizens have the opportunity to travel internationally, let alone do all these shenanigans so it is not a solution that works for most people.

Very good points, though I see little difference from the scenario you are writing to today's conditions (excluding the easy access to debt due to fractional reserves).
Today banks use the old money to provide loans, and old money keeps growing. There is a reason why the gap between the 0.1% and the middle class in terms of their share in the pie keeps growing. Also in your calculations you provide the inflation of %3, but do not include the inflation-adjusted gains (such as CDs, tresuries and municipal bonds, even long term stock market indices). In reality the old money does not lose value since it does not sit idle (like most common folks' savings accounts). What happens is the wages that do not catch up to the inflation melts away as time passes. 
What you are raising however on younger people's opportunities diminishing is a very real and a very scary issue, that exists in both scenarios. I would however assume that at least in a decentralized solution it is up to people's will to fight against this and provide measures (such as higher cost on accumulated money, that is still feasible). I do not see such a solution in a bank-run world we live in today.

Well it is not as straightforward to write the following in a non-finance forum, is it? ELI5 way of telling it is calling the whole investment S&amp;P500 since that is what most people are aware of without giving tedious details. But sure since you raised it as a concern let me explain:
These come from Prof. Shiller's data\*, which dates back to 1871. From 1871 till 1957, since there are no well defined diversified portfolio we look at total market index, which has an annualized avg return of 2.521%, a total dividend reinvested return of 8.096% and total return 80741.187% (about 807x of initial investment), while post 1957 with introduction of well diversified S&amp;P500 index we look at annualized avg return of 6.892%, with dividend reinvested return of 10.094% and total return of 35189.529% (352x).
Thus if you put your money to total market (best alternative to index fund investment since whole market is as diversified as you get) in 1871 and move it all to s&amp;p as soon as it is introduced you get 807\*352\~=280K times the original investment, which is a bit shorter than a million dollar as I suggested above.
If only there was a good way of historically selecting what companies would make S&amp;P 500 before it was born, I'm sure the return rate would be much much larger than aforementioned amount, since the return rate between total market and S&amp;P500 are vastly different.

It is actually more if you consider the lost Bitcoins though, since they are effectively not on the market. So everyday new 1800 coins we get actually inflates the accessible (guesstimated) 15 million Bitcoins not 17.4 million. Thus I would say it should be above 1.80% in practice after 2020.

Thank you so much this was very brief yet informative. I only plan to buy Bitcoins since it is very hard for me to understand all the details of all alternative coins, which sounds like too much time investment. I have been reading about Bitcoin for a quite a while before I started buying, and I do not think I can do the same due diligence on any other coin right now, so according to what I'm hearing Trezor sounds ideal.
A quick follow up, and I know there is no good answer for this but to get a feel for it but, how many coins justify getting an additional cold wallet. Say if I manage to buy 10 Bitcoins at some point, considering the price I am assuming keeping more than 10 Bitcoins in one wallet might not be ideal and perhaps should be split into 2 wallets of 5 since the amount kept is about 100 fold of the cost of the wallet. Is this a reasonable way of thinking or am I being paranoid?
Finally, if I decided to end up with 2 cold wallets, is it more reasonable to buy one of each to minimize the risk of losing all my coins?
@_date: 2019-01-16 23:05:55
You are right, but I'm more curious on why the price difference exists. How come Trezor can sell over Amazon more than half the price compared to their own site?

Yeah, I would love to have that information too. The closer we get on "fiat\_movement\_into\_bitcoin/market\_cap" ratio to 1, the more stable I would assume bitcoin will be, since logic suggests that selling at that point on average will be at loss for median or above holders, which indicates that they thought the price was fair when they purchased it. 
One thing that worries me for instance is somebody who bought at $80 per bitcoin. They certainly held quite a while and I respect that, but it is hard to predict when they will mass exit, which is always a real possibility since the stakes are way too high. Somebody who bough at $6000 a piece on the other hand genuinely thought it was the fair price at the time and is unlikely to sell at $3200 unless s/he really needs the money. This cannot be generalized to everyone of course, but similar to "Central Limit Theorem" if you add up all the random variables (these people in this case) we can actually have a model suggesting what is a stable price for Bitcoin unless a major news develop. I.e. if every coin exchanged hands today into a new acquirer at $3600 per piece (all 17.5 million coins), we can with %100 trust say that this is a very very fair price at valuing Bitcoin.
Anyways, long story short, please let me know if you see that statistics anywhere as I would love to dig into it :)

Point  What I want to underline
Bitcoin is not like tulipmania imho. It is not something we buy just so that we can get rid of it by selling at a higher price tomorrow to some "greater fool", it is something we slowly start investing parts of our portfolio in. Meaning even if we were to reach the saturation point in terms of number of people adopting, it doesn't mean these people won't keep investing in it. Stock markets for instance reached that saturation point long ago but same people keep investing their excess income month after month keeping it afloat.
Point  actually addressing your point
I thought about it too, but then I realized we are living in a bubble (not a financial one) called Western Society. If you look at %80 of the world, people still don't get much opportunities to be a proper part of the world economy.
Look at the credit card penetration metric in India for instace. As of 03/2016 there were only 25M credit cards issued, and these are not unique people count, but unique card counts. So a guesstimate of 20M individuals using credit cards in a society of 1.2B people, merely 3 years ago. Over the last 3 years this number might have drastically changed but it gives us the reality of how different the world is outside of Western Hemisphere.
Then we consider the countries that have technological access but are scared of government regulations like China, Saudi Arabia, Iran, or countries that have lots of parked cash but no way of properly taking it out in mass like Turkey, Russia, Egypt etc etc.
Then we have countries who want to diversify because of their historical economic worries like South Korea (94 IMF scare), Japan (sideways markets for 3 decades) etc.
Finally we have the NA/Europe folks who have been staying away from Bitcoin because of its' volatility, but might consider diversifying once they are convinced this is not a ponzi scheme. Lots of Bogleheads I know (and I am one too) have just started investing in Bitcoin because we now see it under a different light. I was aware of Bitcoin 4 years ago, but dismissed the idea because I thought it was an elaborate scam. I am a huge index\_fund guy, and here you find me diversifying 5-10% of my portfolio into Bitcoin (admittedly not that much money but hey it is still something).
tl;dr: Even if we assume that we reached the saturation point for North America and Europe, which I disagree to some point but agree for a select generation of X and millenials, we have the rest of the world trying to catch up. Only time will tell if Bitcoin will be the medium for people to gather around, but I certainly see a huge wave of economically aware masses coming and start challenging today's world order.

It is all about adoption. Notice how Google+ or any other alternative could not replace Facebook. Whenever a real competition came, FB either bought it (Instagram) or adapted to the alternative (Snapchat Stories). Bitcoin is similarly evolving, and there is no reason why the community might not evolve it into whatever the alternative is providing. Facebook might die in the next 10 years, perhaps because people are stopping using it, but in the interim it provides the value and such a change won't happen over a day.
For Bitcoin to be replaced people need to vacate it for an alternative \`en masse\`. Why this might happen? If bitcoin somehow is short on some vertical and an alternative provides you everything and more. Right now apart from the speed of transactions I do not see much shortcomings of bitcoin, and this weakness is attempted to be taken care by LN. For some privacy might be an issue, but majority of Bitcoin holders are not doing it to hide from government.
Btw, a slight nitpick on your order, ICQ came before MSN-Messenger and was popular way before it.

That is interesting. I wonder how they deal with scammy things like making a transfer, using it in the transferred location and cancelling the transfer from the origin.

Did you even read my comment? I am saying whatever is believed to be happening will have its' priced baked in already. I am not saying it won't have a long term effect, I am saying on the day of halvening you won't see anything significant. But hey, since you think "I don't know what I am talking about" maybe we should check the impact of it on in the past "on the day of halvening".
I did not say anything in my comment on 6-10 months after the event. That is not the point. Bitcoin has been ever-rising asset class so far so of course if you look at a larger window you will see it going up at some point but you cannot say "this happened because of halvening" with confidence. What we know is that if there is a public information that is surely going to impact the price of an asset on a specific date, people would invest in it prior to that event making its' short term impact hard to assess so as I said earlier, the actual date means nothing!
11/28/2012 first halving
+-3 days pricing:
11/25 - $12.41
11/26 - $12.48
11/27 - $12.25
11/28 - $12.20
11/29 - $12.35
11/30 - $12.45
12/01 - $12.57
7/9/2016 - 2nd halving
$662, $672, $635, $662, $657, $642, $646 ... few weeks after, 08/02 onward $513, $566, $576
Do you see mind blowing movement right before or right after the halvening day? no? that is because the price is baked in.
tl;dr: Actual date has no significance on the price. The supply shrink has it, and its' price will be ... baked in. There you go. This is independent of bitcoin, true for any speculative asset with material public information release.

It actually refers to a saying during famous stock market crash named great depression and is attributed to daddy Kennedy, who made a fortune from stock markets (with insider information but that is beyond our topic right now). Supposably, one day he walks in the street and his shoe\~shining boy (one of the lowest labor jobs of the time) talks about how 'him and his whole family buy stocks with every penny they earn because it is guaranteed to double by next year'. As soon as he hears this he realizes that the market is in a bubble. Not sure if there is any proof to this attribution but it is quite famous.
The hypothesis is that if everybody you can imagine (even the financially illiterate) is buying the stocks, then it pretty much reached the highest liquidity it can handle, and there is not much room for growth left. This especially fits for bubbles, since bubbles depend on finding the "greater fool" who is willing to pay more than what you have paid for the same item, but if there is no more fool left then you end up being the greatest fool

I'm actually quite confused on how people have this huge trust that a single Bitcoin will be worth 7 figures in the recent future (like 10-12 year time frame). Trust me  I would be delighted if that happened, but I just cannot fathom Bitcoin to have a market cap of 19 Trillion dollars.
19 Trillion dollars. Where do all this money come from?
\- It is not "debt" for sure, nobody would give out loans for you to buy crypto.
\- It is not "derivatives" either.
\- It is unlikely to be "broad money" or liquidated assets. How many people would be willing to sell their home/car to buy Bitcoin.
So it leaves us with "narrow money", which has a total global supply of 37 Trillion dollars. So we are saying that more than half of the global narrow money will be converted to Bitcoin? Think about it, this means Bitcoin needs to be a much better alternative to todays financial system in our day-to-day activities to have a larger portion of the narrow money over the sum of all other account holders. How is that feasible anytime within the next 30 years?
I am a believer, and I trust Bitcoin will be much more successful than what it is today, but I just cannot wrap my head around these 7 figure theories. Most of these theories look at previous charts and adjust the time frame, but honestly it is much easier for something small to grow fast, not so easy for a leviathan to grow. This is true for anything, even most successful companies in the world eventually hit the "growth paradigm". When they are startups they grow 6x every year, when they are innovative mid-size companies they grow 1.9x every year, yet there comes a time even 1.2x growth becomes unsustainable.
tl;dr: how do you guys justify the current growth trajectory to hold?

You are talking about 51% attack where they control majority of mining pool and re-write history, which is a totally different beast since that would break trust to Bitcoin and make the price crash as people desert it for good.
Or if you are talking about controlling the majority hash power without doing the 51% attack (somehow let us assume community trusts them) that will only be true as long as they keep the mining scheme at that rate continuously. Not like a one-time blow of buying a bulk and forever controlling the supply, so there is your diff.

I think I came off the wrong way. I do not argue against the value of  astroid mining, on the contrary I think it will make up for its' cost just like my "frakking" example, which made USA the top oil producer of the world as of last year.
What I argue is that just because astroid mining happens does not make the rare earth material value to tank like OP suggests, and that it would find a nice balance.
Yes no analogy is perfect, certainly not my oil one but it is a good example because of the "price"&lt;-&gt;"supply" impact triggering the "expensive exploration" phase or shutting it down, thus providing a balance.

But you can do the same thing if Bitcoin is stable enough. Say bitcoin found its' stability and is growing giver-or-take %5 value a year due to being deflationary with the value of $100,000 per your example. All your friend has to do is to offer you a contract where he takes 1 bitcoin from you and return '1 bitcoin + 2 million satoshi' to you at the end of your contract.
That way your bitcoin is not sitting either, only portion of the value is coming from natural growth of the deflationary policy and the rest from the productivity of your friends' company. This only does not hold if bitcoin value steadily and continuously rises over the productivity levels every single year, which would suggest bitcoin is not stable enough anyways so wasn't ready to take over the current money market.

This is correct if the assumption of HODL to be kept as is at prices of 1 million USD per coin. Otherwise any coin that changes hand will require a form of liquidation and exchange of money. Unless less than %10 of the coins available to be in circulation (so %90 is never going to be sold all the way until that price point, which is hard to believe) it is not too far fetched to calculate the market cap with the amount of money spent on it.
The other point to make is that if the price rise happens with less money spent, eventually when liquidation happens the price does not stay in the previous range. We can see than in the few months of 2017 where $2B spent in Bitcoin rising the market cap of Bitcoin to an order of magnitude higher, only to be dwindling down to current prices. Meaning unless that amount of money is being circulated in the Bitcoin realm the price will not be stable around 1 million dollars per coin.

Or ... here is an alternative ... will have a small minority keep using it while overall population grows. In such case it becomes deflationary by nature yet still exists.

Thanks for responding, I hope you don't mind if I ask a bit more.
Wouldn't that (rent / owners\_equivalent\_of\_rent) be highly correlated with house prices rises?
Say I have a house that I'm renting out, which was worth $180,000 5 years ago and I was renting it out for $1,000 per month (15 year amortization minus taxes and fix costs). After 5 years if my house is worth $360,000 (2x), then either I should be expecting $2,000 rent or liquidate it to put it on other assets that have 15 year amortization, since current rent would have 30 year amortization which is obviously a loss for me.
Basically isn't the "demand" portion of the house price rise similarly impacting the rent? Thus rent increases becomes a proxy of the house price increase in the CPI. Sure it can be a lagging indicator for a few reasons, but if you look at the long time window you should see them being very highly correlated.
Am I missing something here?
@_date: 2019-01-28 21:32:35
How do you know it wasn't priced in? Just because Bitcoin price rose some arbitrary months after halvening doesn't mean it rose because of it. There are literally thousands of other reasons it can and did happen. In fact the cut in supply was literally an order of magnitude less than increase in demand so if anything its' impacts were marginal compared to the adoption.

I like your article in general but am confused about the conclusion you arrive.
So normally when you short something like a stock, you are borrowing it and immediately selling, hoping to be able to buy it back from a lower price before your contract expires. This is indeed a 'paper stock', something like a derivative that is not directly limited w.r.t. stock supply (since multi level borrowing can happen). But there is a catch. If you cannot buy the stock back before the end of contract you are screwed. This is why something called "short squuze" happens when the price of an asset suddenly rises and there is not enough sellers for shorters to buy back their borrowed shares to complete their contract.
Why would this be different w.r.t. Bitcoin. Right now there are plenty of people selling it so sure shorters get a good deal, but when the Bitcoin supply dries out (i.e. you ran out of weak hands and hodlers refusing to sell, making the supply low and pressuring the price increase) wouldn't this screw such paper contracts?  After all they have to buy the Bitcoins back in some way. So technically they are not printing new Bitcoins, they are printing IOUs that keep passed around.
My point is, why  do you think the collapse of USD is the only solution to this problem. Sudden rise in Bitcoin prices or supply dry might easily take care of this too, right?
Am I missing something here?

Statistics of this nature is very flawed and yes there is no 'one formula fits' all basket of goods with correct distribution to represent how one's purchasing price is impacted but most of these are calculated for the lower-medium income group so should be somewhat representative unless the government itself purposefully tainting it, which is something I would not believe unless there are studies clarifying it other than some dictatorships where there is no transparency between government agencies. There is a great quote about it: "**Never attribute to malice** that which is adequately explained by stupidity".

That is the very point I am making. Because we were not there (i.e. %0.5 of all narrow money being spent on Bitcoin) we actually could not keep the 20K prices. Think about it, during 2017 boom, only $2B was introduced into Bitcoin, which clearly does not justify the hundreds of billions of dollar valuation, which eventually got busted. In order to have long term stable (say staying on or above that level) price of 20K we should be seeing about at least $150-200B to be eventually spent on Bitcoin, averaging the entry point of bitcoin purchases to stay afloat, thus avoiding "get rich quick" selling.
If we genuinely suggest that with $100B of investment Bitcoin cap should reach 19T, we are clearly trying to justify a bubble. At the end of the day it does not matter what the price of last Bitcoin was sold minutes ago, but what people consider a stable price to not sell their coins. If majority thinks $3000 is too low for Bitcoin, they won't sell it thus buyers will have to purchase it above that price point. Just because 10 folks decided to sell it for $2000 won't make it any different. Likewise if only 0.5% of the coins were valued at 1 million dollar for a short time, it doesn't mean all bitcoins will hold that value and when people mass sell it will just dwindle down, just like what happened during 2018.
@_date: 2019-01-15 21:56:13
If it were to reach 100,000 buying from $2500 or $3600 won't make a huge difference in terms of your lifestyle upgrades, but waiting for the $2500 and (if it doesn't reach there) losing a good entry point might ruin your plan.
All I am saying is if you believe it will reach 100K in the next few decades, don't save all your money until the optimal hypothetical price point and start buying now to average your cost of entry. 
@_date: 2019-01-28 18:33:11
Not necessarily true. This would only be valid if the market belief in Bitcoin is static or trending upwards, otherwise it can very easily be that satoshi purchase power can go down. 
Here is an example. Think of Limited Edition Collectible item X (i.e. Black Lotus card of Magic the Gathering), which trades in about $15K today. There are only limited amount of them and over time this can only stay as is or get lower (i.e. card can burn, lost, got wet etc). So by your logic it should increase in value forevermore, right? This is only correct with the assumption that people still give a shit about MtG. If 2 years down the road people stopped caring about the game, I can assure you the price of "Black Lotus" would significantly go down as its' collectible value would be diminishing due to lack of interest in the market.
Now clearly bitcoin is not some mint condition limited card or toy or sth and has utility, but the principle holds. If people give up on bitcoin, the "supply being fixed" is not going to save it.
@_date: 2019-01-15 00:10:50
If you genuinely believe this you do not have to wait until $2800 emotional price point you believe it will touch. If this chart were to be correct it suggests roughly $100K per bitcoin by sometime 2021, so your if you bought from $2800 your $100 will turn into $3500, and if you bought from today's price of $3700 it will turn into $2700.
35x over 27x sounds like a huge difference but honestly not that big considering the potential risk you are taking. What if this was already the bottom and it never reaches $2800, and you miss your chance of buying while waiting for this hypothetical bottom, end up buying eventually from 5000? You are already reduced to 20x. No need to be greedy.
Again, this is all if your chart and prediction were to come true. If you really believe it will happen, I would suggest you start buying today, probably price point average it over the next year or so.

It has a lot to do with the debt if you cannot afford to buy the house with all cash. It also has a lot to do with making use of all time low interest rates.
House is just one example of good debt, and although you are right that its' returns diminish after the first one there are other smart debts as well. My point is that awareness of how to optimize your returns by relying on debt is not bad. People here love the "debt is evil, debt ruins your life, it makes you a slave" argument, and I am merely giving counter examples to it.

A. I agree
B. I'm sorry but that is not how correlation is used. My daily pooping pattern and and the next door neighbours' barking timing also are in sync and are correlated but I cannot pull out a causation from 'the dog is barking because I just pooped'. Maybe it is and the dog really smells my stinky poop, or maybe there is an underlying third thing (an external variable) that somehow overlaps with the timing of both events.
On the other hand 'efficient market theory' is a heavily studied economics concept with plenty of academic backing. So it is much more reasonable to believe that it is baked in compared to a chart of 'correlation' for a sample size of 3 and external-variable count of thousands.

This doesn't make much sense. First off, if hash rates were to decline that far like it was estimated then Bitcoin price will likely be lower as well so the rate of electricity vs the mined coin gap will still exist. In fact with lower hash rate outdated mining rigs might even come back to increase the competition, which in return will raise the hashrate again. But more importantly ...
ASIC mining has a huge sunk cost, not just electricity, which depreciates pretty quickly. So practically speaking here are two likely scenarios and their outcome, for the case of say having $1M to invest in it (which in most cases is a loan):
* you spend $2000-$5000 for the latest equipment (S15, Dragonmint etc etc) + power source + safe setup per machine and renting out a 'factory'/'barn' for the next 3 years. Assume $500K spent for this on 100 such units.
* Then you use the rest of the $500K for the electricity bills for the next 3 years (about $950 per machine per year) and if you took out a loan you pay the interest payments ($200K), if it was your own money you get the sunk cost of not investing in which should cover the rest.
* During these 3 years, you start with net negative of %10 w.r.t. electricity cost per unit but in 3 years almost all your miners will be close to obsolete so you are actually taking more like %60-70 loss on your investment. This only evens out if the average bitcoin price goes 3x or so in the next 3 years, which is admittedly not unlikely.
* you ignore everything else and reserve the same $200K for 3 year payments or sunk cost on not investing to other assets, and buy $800K worth of Bitcoins.
* If at the end of the 3 years it triples like you hoped in scenario-1 you are already ahead of that case since no depreciation happened, no electricity/rent cost happened etc.
* Say Bitcoin price went down, unless it went much lower than what you can sell your miners for S2 is still better off than S1.
Only way S1 is better is if Bitcoin sharply rose and the market cannot get their hands on the Miners quickly enough, yet S1 investor already has a farm thus gets off nicely. But that is basically putting your money on a horse-race and guessing the perfect timing.
If so then why are miners still doing their stuff:
1. Unlike what JPM thinks, electricity cost is not uniform around the world in terms of purchase power, for some it is almost free while others it is very expensive.
2. Some people already bought their miners a while ago and they are depreciating as we speak. Their best bet is to keep using them and hope bitcoin prices to recover so they didn't waste their time and money on their farms.

OK, no offense OP but astroid mining is not going to make the gold value tank for the simple reasoning of supply/demand dynamics.
Mining astroids is not a cheap task and is only going to be funded of the rare elements are so rare that we are willing to take in the sunk cost of sending rockets to said astroids, waste months on logistics and insane amount of resources for the payload to come back, not to include expense of scientific support ... only to do what, increase the supply of the said element to the extent that it will be effectively unlimited, and thus valueless? 
Think about oil if it makes the anology easier on the mind. Right now there are billions of barrels of oil stay untouched, despite us knowing their location (Northern Atlantic, Canadian Sands etc etc) because the extraction cost is not justifiable w.r.t. the value you get out of it. Some of these were attempted to be excavated when oil prices hit $115, which made the "fracking" in US viable. Think of "fracking" as astroid mining, since traditionally getting these little pockets of oils was too expensive compared to buying the said oil from Saudi Arabia etc. As soon as oil prices hit above $80 per barrel all of a sudden people realized there is much to gain from it, with lagging effect taking place around oil price of $115. Because of the additional supply oil prices tanked all the way down to $36 in mere 1.5 years. So far so good? Great! Now, what happened afterwards? Lots of US fracking companies went bankrupt because they could not make money when oil was that cheap and with the push from OPEC as well they were squeezed, only to make oil prices back to $50-80 range again. Here fracking works to some extent but not a lot, while deep sea exploration does not and so far we see some balance. What did not happen is oil prices going below $20 because of the "unlimited supply" you mention.
tl;dr; astroid mining is an over exaggerated topic.

Cyrpto tax itself is a complicated topic, but ignoring that for a bit and assuming it is a regular asset, even if you sold them unless there was realized gain exceeding the realized losses you do not need to pay taxes on it anyways.
Since you never cashed out, there was zero realized gain and zero realized loss so you won't have to pay anything.

This is totally my personal opinion, but it might just not end (anytime soon). Take a look at Japan interest rates from 1986 for instance, where 5-7% interest rates were standard prior. It went all the way down to 1% level by end of 1990s and pretty much never recovered afterwards. They have been having negative rates for at least 3 years now.
During these last few decades, Japanese population took it pretty hard. Many people's assets either stagnated in value or washed away. And it is still looking bleak. Japan somehow cannot get out of this whirlpool. Yet Japanese people did not take it to the streets and quietly accepted this doom.
I am not saying this will happen to Europe (or even US) as there are many other factors in this game (like Japan's aging population, culture of investing etc) but we have to entertain the possibility that we might be entering into a realm of economics that will keep us on this stage for decades to come. The thing is even if that happens people won't complain to the level of revolts, I can guarantee you that.

Getting to some mark with low liquidity on a short time frame does not tell much to be honest. We could have gone 38k for 30 minutes, would that justify 38k as a valid price? Anything above 7k was short lived during 2017, and likely true value of Bitcoin was around 3-4k at the time, which is easy to say for me since I can see what is regressed to in 2019. 7k/12k/19k these are just some numbers that Bitcoin held for a limited time frame when people were trading irrationally.
Do not get me wrong, I think Bitcoin will see new highs, but taking 19k as a reliable reference point is moot imho.

This is not true. If they can sell these bonds for higher face value in the future they can technically make money. This of course means that future interest rates should be further negative than what is marked today, so all in all that is a gamble and a speculation, but it doesn't automatically mean they get insolvent.

Honestly I do not get the obsession with the "whole bitcoin" thing. Satoshi could have easily set it up to 63 million, or 147 million. Heck it is divisible in every possible meaning of the word, so whether people have 100m satoshi at price $10,000 or 1m satoshi at price of $1m does not make much difference.
For what its' worth I think mBtc is a good good balance, since it allows most people on earth to have a goal if they still want to be obsessed with some "whole coin". It should be a coin of itself probably and satoshi should be measured to mBTC instead :)

Oh god, seriously how edgy are you?
Fine let me ELI5 to you how this works, hopefully you are here to learn so you will stop acting like "know it all" afterwards.
1. Say I bought $103 worth of Bond with **roughly** \-0.1% ( you see that negative in the beginning, right?), so by 30 years the face value of this bond will be roughly worth $100. So far so good? Are you following me with your super advanced math skills?
2. Fast forward 1 year and interest rates are **roughly** \-0.33%, and now buying the same bond costs the public about $110 to get the same face value around same maturity time. Wow math ... so hard!
3. But wait, I come in the picture again, and say that I can sell mine that matures in 29 years for ... $108. That way the **bond buyer can lose $2 LESS** for the same deal.
Woah! Dude! I just sold the bond I bought for $103 to $108 in a year, making almost 5% **profit**, on a **negative interest rate going further negative. Math Dude, so cool!**
FYI when you talk to internet strangers don't assume they are beneath you. I may or may not have a graduate degree in a math field (not going to disclose), but the truth is this is not even about math it is about market trading and bond-convexity. This is why I am telling you assuming you know everything without even ever using it once sounds too edgy.
Hopefully now you can put your keyboard down and admit that you were wrong instead of getting even edgier and try to attack me personally.
@_date: 2019-09-13 14:28:25
There are two types of Bond investments:
1. You buy it and wait until it matures. Here the interest rate is the factor that decides what you shall be getting at the end. When rates are negative this is clearly at your disadvantage but still if you plan to have a cash position as a retail investor (not sure why) for a very large amount this is what you do for the lowest risk. Retail investors generally do not have that big a cash position so this usually applies to retirement funds, pensions, other governments storing their wealth etc.
2. You play the direction of interest rates and trade them.
Here is an example for  say interest rates are -0.10% for a 30 year plan, so if I invest roughly $103 into it 30 years later I will get $100 with a loss of $3, but regardless I still do.
Fast forward 1 year and central banks decided to push the interest rates to -0.33%. Now whoever is buying these bond will have to put $110 to get $100 back in 30 years. But wait, I can sell mine which will mature in not 30 but 29 years for a deal price of $108. That way bond buyer can get $2 deal, while I would be making a hefty $5 profit within a year.
As you can see bond trading can be profitable, especially for longer time period bonds (FYI this is called \`bond convexity\`). But there is a catch: you buy with the expectation that a. interest rates would go even further South, b. someone else will be interested in buying bonds at those rates. This is clearly speculation, so be wary.

Neither am I (though I love reading about macroeconomics as a hobby).


So let us look back a little in history. US was not always the central economy of the world, and USD was not always the reserve currency. In fact up until 20th century British Pound was the world reserve currency as they had influence over everywhere in that empire of theirs where sun never sets. Then came separation of their states, WWI, WWII and they kept losing their influence decade after decade. US just happened to be the best alternative with large gold reserves, safer/younger/more-productive workforce, vast amount of natural resources etc.
But let us look back a bit more, history in reverse order. USD -&gt; British Pound -&gt; French Frank -&gt; Dutch Gilder (guilder) -&gt; Florentine Florin -&gt; Venetian Decato -&gt; Dinar (Arabic) -&gt; Solidus (Byzantine) -&gt; Denari (Roman) -&gt; Drachma (Greek), and perhaps more that I do not know of.
As you can see, there will always be the next contestant who will pick up the flag. Some country that promises stability, trust, reliability and growth with proper backing. And slowly and steadily rest of the world will start using their paper back.
At least that is what has been happening. Of course we should note that many of the above currencies were actually backed by the physical coins with rare metals, so they themselves showed perceived value up until 16th century, so that trust to the issuer was less of an issue historically.


These things don't happen over a day, so I would not expect sharp ripple effects, but during the switch there will of course be pain points.
Once again, just my personal opinion, I'm not an economist.

Just out of curiosity, would barter be considered 'crypto-to-fiat'? I.e. if I want to buy your car for 3 bitcoins, technically no fiat conversion occurs, so would I be paying taxes in this case?
@_date: 2019-09-12 18:45:17
it is on "capital gains" so if you converted them 10 times without making any money, you owe nothing. If you lose money you probably can count it against the money you make later on to balance them out. 
So you will only be paying tax on total amount you gained, the number of times it exchanged should not matter imho.
@_date: 2019-05-20 14:13:10
Though you are right total money flow represents the demand-side-grow of this equation, while I was arguing impact of the supply side change. Independent of the supply side change demand can increase, stay the same or go down so I am trying to make an unbiased observation on supply without demand projections.
Also let us not forget that network also grew significantly over these years so total money flow doesn't seem to be the problem, especially since everybody and their grandmother now at least heard about Bitcoin and we are talking about few billion dollars of inflow per year which is peanuts in global economy.
@_date: 2019-05-16 15:56:47
At the very least by buying he is adding demand to meet the supply, making the network more balanced and thus having upwards pressure to the price, which in return incentives more people to mine and thus increasing the hashpower. 
On a secondary point, as his Bitcoin holdings grow he is more incentivized to take matters in his own hand rather than using SPVs and will likely host a full node, which clearly helps decentralization.
Finally he will eventually use it to barter, which also takes power away from fiat no matter how small.
So ... yes, him/her buying Bitcoin helps.

Today you would need $8m worth of Bitcoin (1000 btc) to sell in a market where daily exchange volume is say $1.6b (assume 200k volume). When bitcoin hits 100k in the future, this volume might be staying the same (again assume 200k) but the total volume in USD would be $16b so even though you are trading $8m worth of Bitcoins  (100 btc) like you did in the past the impact of your mass sale is much less significant than it used to be.

I do not think that is a fair comparison though. Air travel provides you a service, **which is otherwise orders of magnitudes harder to accomplish** (i.e. driving for days, or biking for weeks etc). What Bitcoin provides is a service that has equivalent (or even better) quality if you ignore the centralization aspect (which doesn't matter to a majority of small transactions one would make so it should be held to same standards to those alternatives if it wants to competes in that realm.
Now if we are to say Bitcoin is only store of value and is not here for small transactions, perhaps it does not need to compete and thus can afford high fees for occasional big money moves. **However, saying \`it needs global scale adoption as a replacement of current banking system\` while also saying \`high fees are not an issue\` is contradictory imho.**

This is correct for now because there is no profit route, but will it be once the space travel is done for profit reasons? Perhaps for military reasons I can see this happening (like how we subsidize Lockheed Martin etc) so you might be onto sth here.


I would assume this to be a very minor part of the economics of whole space exploration, at least until we find a way to make these trips quicker and more efficient. I won't sit on my ass for 3 years just to visit Mars for instance.


This is true, but the time is not free. There is limitation on how much you can accelerate your spacecraft reliably, and linear scaling there won't make 300-400 million km one way travel quick. We need some major scientific advancement (sth like 'Epstein Drive' from Expanse books, which is quite realistic imho).


Sending low risk probes and gigantic mining rigs are likely different, but I am not expert here, thus I will not insist, perhaps you are right and this is already a solved problem.


Well 20 years sound too quick to me given how fast we followed the past achievements (Moon till today) but I guess one cannot really estimate the scientific advancement pace by looking at history so you might be right there. I still don't think I will get to see it.

Off the top of my head Washington and Florida do not have income taxes so they sound safe.

Afterwards you can keep the rest of the 125+ Bitcoins for eternity if you wish.

All you need to do is to keep your coins over a year so they can qualify for Long Term Capital Gains, and make sure to not sell more than $39,000 per year if you are single or $77,000 if you are married filing jointly. If this amount is enough for you to live just don't work and keep your annual income at or below these levels which guarantees 0% tax on your profit.
This of course assumes you have lots and lots of Bitcoins, but hey if one is considering to move to another state just for tax reasons it seems like they qualify to be in this group.

About 30% of the bitcoins have not been transacted in over 3 years, which is fair to assume are hedl+lost, which is over 5.3 millions bitcoins. Estimated 2 million of those are lost (4m number quoted is quite unlikely) so remaining 3.3 million are likely to be held by heavy believers.
Even if one were to ignore the holders among the rest of the 70% coin holders (which we know are plenty but let us assume distribution of coins for new holders are somewhat more fair), and about 6 million Bitcoin users back in 2016, then follow the power law distribution (90/10 to third degree) with rough estimation 72% of those coins would be held by 0.1% of those 6m people; we come up with following really crude estimation with buffers all over the place:
\- 6,000 people having access to 2.4 million Bitcoins ... 400+ coins. This is after all the conservative cutoffs we had, ignoring vast majority of the coins, any growth in people's portfolio in the last 3 years and other hodlers.
Now as today 130+ is a Bitcoin millionaire, so I would assume we should have at least an order of magnitude larger than the 6,000 number we have.

You are right, but what I was pointing out was that the drasticity of the inflation delta, not the absolute value of the inflation. I.e.
\- around the end of first reward era, with over 10m coins available, inflation of bitcoin per year was close to 26% (50 coins per block, 7200 per day, 2.6m per year). Around the start of the second reward era, this inflation was drastically cut to 13%. The delta here is insane, and if you applied it to any developing country today with similar rates (i.e. Turkey) you would see crazy spikes in their valuation and growth number all else being the same.
\- around the end of second reward era with 15m coins available inflation per year was already dwindled down to 8.6% from 13% in a slow and steady way, and quickly after second reward era it became 4.1% (0.65m coins per day, 15.75m coins available). This inflation rate drop is not as insane as the above one, and can actually be seen in the first world countries (North America, Europe etc) that have some major economic event in the recent history. The delta is merely a &lt;5% inflation change, still expected to have immediate major impact but less of a "miracle" story than the previous one.
\- now around the end of third reward era, we have close to 18m available coins we have close to 3.6% inflation, and quickly afterwards we expect 1.7% inflation rate (0.325m per year, 18.375m available). Delta here is actually quite tame. Sure if you apply it to a major first world country over a period of 10 years consistently it would make a big difference, but the immediate change is not so recognizable. I.e. today if US inflation rate was to increase 3.4% or to be dropped to 0.1% (which kinda happened after 2008) you would see changes, but you would not see US economy being redefined and completely reevaluated.
I agree with both you and u/[ArcticRhombus]( that these estimations are crude and has flawed assumptions, but the underlying point stands that the delta we see is getting tamer and tamer with market cap growing steadily. Therefore my emerging nations to first world countries inflation analogy seems to be a fair one to use imho.

This is true for well diversified portfolios (i.e. keeping majority of your money in index funds etc). Time in the market for individual stocks just scream out 'risk', since no industry stays the same over few decades. Even the safest looking stocks either get stuck due to lack of growth or go down due to industry becoming irrelevant.
There are very few exceptions to this (i.e. Coca Cola, Apple (which almost went bankrupt at some point but oh well) etc) and being able to pick those over thousands of other 'good looking' stocks is quite unlikely.

I'm curious about the impact of this halvening compared to the previous 2. If you think about it earlier halvenings were cutting bigger supply from a smaller pool. I.e.
\- First halvening takes away 25 coins per block, or 3600 per day, or 1.3m coins per year off the table from a collected pool of 10.5m coins.
\- Second halvening takes away 12.5 coins per block, or 1800 per day, or 0.65m coins per year off the table from a collected pool of 15.75m coins.
So in order to meet the same demand, in the first halvening over 12% of all the coins needed to be shifted to active pool (i.e. more selling from hodling) per year, wherein the second one only 4% of the pool shifting to active market meets the demand per year. Considering halvenings keep for 4 years this clearly is not sustainable, so dramatic price rise is observed.
\- Now for the third halvening we are look at 6.75 coins per block, or 900 per day, or 0.325m coins per year off the table from a collected pool of 18.375m coins.
Here less than 2% (1.7% to be exact) of existing coins shifting to active trading per year would thus be meeting demand. Even over 4 years, this is nowhere near as dramatic as people put it to be.
So my question is, why do people expect same level of impact from this halvening when the conditions are much more different this time?
Edit: To clarify the impact of halvening rather than replying to individual messages
Supply change works as following (assumed probabilities and demand numbers but the message stays the same), starting from today;
1. Time t, assume you have 100,000 bitcoins exchange hands on average, and say 2% of buyers are HODLers, making 2,000 of these coins go away and locked up until a certain price is met (or never for some folks)
2. Time t+1, still similar volume, most of t's coins (98,000) still on the market, but another 1800 was mined and assume 1,500 of these are immediately sold (since miners have real costs and most cannot afford to hoard the coins), making the total pool 99,500, but the demand was 100,000 so remaining demand is met by someone willing to sell their coins for a slightly higher price making Bitcoin price raise. If demand  was a bit lower that day the opposite happens. Here you can see why a whale mass order can change things significantly but that is not our point. Again 2% of buyers HODL, so another 2,000 gets locked away until higher prices met
3. repeat the same for day in day out, while everyday depending on the demand either the pool shrinks and more coins need to be moved to hot wallets, or demand shrinks and people sell their coins at loss.
4. There comes t+365, where halving happens. Assuming demand was still stable around 100,000, the new supply goes 900 from 1800. This 900 needs to be met by someone moving their coins to their hot wallet and willing to sell. At first it makes very little difference, since 900 is barely anything compared to total volume of existing coins, however note that 2% of each purchase is locked away for good.
5. t+366, another 900 new supply coming in, another 2% got hedl since price point is not there yet to liquidate them ...
6. t+480, now ready-supply starts getting dried out. For almost 4 months new 900 coins entered space, and a portion of them got locked away. There comes a point where a mismatched demand increase easily squeezes out the order books and we see very sharp rise in price so that some of the previously locked away coins can make their way into the hot wallets to meet the demand.
7. t+481, same happens again, wow it is rising fast.
8. t+510, the thing is price rose so fast to the point where many locked away coins got "unlock price" at the same time, now they are flooding the market, causing massive drop in prices
9. t+550, some balance have been found, at much lower value from the ATH we saw around \`t+500\`, now demand and supply are somewhat in sync, everyone knows what to expect.
10. .. some drama on dip, rise etc etc that are not related to this supply-demand point
As you can see, the ratio of the "cut in supply" to available coins make a huge difference in this loop. If that 900 was 1800 per day, you can see these happening more drastically, similarly if available coins were not 18.375m but 10.5m million chances of coins getting unlocked also decreases until higher price point is met.

Until what point do hodlers hodl? I am pretty late to the game so I do not expect to earn my financial freedom from Bitcoin and just want to be a part of it, but I know there are plenty of people in this forum who have 250+ bitcoins. They have been hodling and buying for a long while, but at some point when their net worth is above millions of dollars wouldn't they want to sell a portion of it to diversify their holdings?
For anyone who have over 100 bitcoins as soon as prices start hitting $25,000 it seems like they might unload a good portion of their stash, and considering how many people are hodling I wonder if other folks like me fear a major market move when that happens.

yep, which is why I wrote this sentence.


That being said, for a large part of US 77k is more than enough to survive. I used to live in Midwest on 18k per year income not too long ago as a bachelor. Also note that this is only "capital gains". I.e. if you bought your bitcoin today at $8,000 and sold it for $85,000, technically you will have 85k to spend that year but your CG is only 77k so you do not pay any tax. 
Finally it is not like you absolutely cannot exceed this amount. I.e. if you had capital gains of 100k, you end up paying 15% tax on the remaining part of 23k, which is not a lot in case you need a bit of a buffer.

I think people always think on absolutes. There is no reason why Bitcoin cannot operate as part of the ecosystem, an alternative, to the existing financial system in harmony. 
When people say "Bitcoin becoming the preferred currency of the future" it sounds like everyone would have to use Bitcoin, but I do not see it that way. It would be a choice. There are old people today who do not use credit cards for instance and pay their groceries with checks. In fact if you look deeper, mainstream use of credit cards barely date back 2 decades. Sure they are the overwhelming choice for developed world right now, but even then one can operate using checks/cash etc. When/if Bitcoin takes over, I see no reason why today's debit/credit cards have to vanish into thin air, I would assume plenty of people would still use it on day-to-day basis purely out of convenience.

You are 100% right, but question is \`does the statelessness of your money have to apply to all your money, or only the part you are not actively using\`? In other words, do you need to do all your transactions using Bitcoin on layer-1? If the answer is yes, then Bitcoin needs to be able to compete with the current convenient alternatives with reasonable fees, which is pretty hard considering it has to meet the decentralization requirements, which is a huge burden on its' shoulders, so it starts with a very large handicap.
FYI my position in this argument is neither. I know it is an unpopular opinion in the crypto world, but when the day comes where Bitcoin is a world-level player, I have no problem having my main savings stay in Bitcoin, yet keeping a small percent in custodial wallets, (heck even the banks) for convenience purposes. One transaction a month from my cold wallet to Banks/Custodial is no big deal. Even today I use lightning via BlueWallet and not Eclair, because it is much easier for small amounts of money. IMHO, if Bitcoin needs to be able to compete, its' users have to compromise at some point.
Just my two cents.

To be honest you were probably right that 5k was the "realistic" top at the moment. It went up to 20k with a hype, which quickly dwindled down to 6-7k level and stayed there for half a year, which supports the theory that 5-8k range was what actual investors were comfortable with, and those who took it to 20k were mostly speculators.

I actually quite like the SF ratio as a metric, but have reservations on its' validity for Bitcoin.
The reason why SF works great for most commodities is the feedback loop it generates. So the main point of SF ratio is this: say value of copper doubled overnight, you have lots of institutions invest in more copper mines and increase the flow, thus dwarf the stock and balance the price again. Only for those commodities where flow cannot be increased at whim that their value is less vulnerable to fluctuations.
So for most commodities stock and flow are parts of a function that complete each other. This does not seem to be the case for Bitcoin. In fact for Bitcoin stock and the flow are **independent and are artificially set into their motion by a mathematical function rather than the natural mining conditions of Silver and Gold**.
Let's say Bitcoin used a harsher block reward function, where it went down to 1/4th instead of half every 4 years. Starts with 50 per block, then 12.5 per block, then 3.125 etc. Or say community had a consensus and decided to approve a hard fork that lowered the block rewards significantly, should Bitcoin price immediately hike? If that were to be the case don't you think most nodes would vote for it? Clearly SF ratio would have been strictly higher in this situation, but would that suggest that Bitcoin price would have been much higher than what it is today?  If so then we would arrive to the conclusion that **any price for Bitcoin could have been achieved by the community by simply changing this function**, which goes against everything we know about "efficient markets".
For another point of view consider the following case for instance: BCH currently have almost identical SF ratio to Bitcoin, and the future SF ratio will also be mostly kept the same. Should BCH also be valued similar to Gold (which we currently know that a disparity exists). What about Bitcoin Gold or BSV or whatever? We know clearly that pricing mechanisms of Bitcoin vs its' alternatives are clear as day and night by the market, despite their almost identical SF ratio. Thus, clearly SF ratio is not purely dictating the 'store-of-value' functionality of a commodity like it does on Gold or Silver. Or so to say, **people are not flocking into cryptocurrencies because of their SF ratio**.
Don't get me wrong, I agree that SF ratio of Bitcoin should have an impact assuming demand stays the same or higher, because of the current trajectory, but I would not be tying the price of Bitcoin to its' SF ratio directly.

I do not think u/stevehl42 's comment was a 1-off snide remark, and I think he is right. We do not know if Uber "works" yet or not since so far all they did was to burn investors' money and promise rosy pink tomorrow where they will make money. Taxis, for better or worse, are profitable, Uber/Lyft so far are not, and until they are they might just be considered as an ongoing experiment without knowing it would be successful in the future or not.
Just because something is a paradigm shift or is disruptive doesn't mean it would work and be a long term viable alternative. Space Tourism was also a paradigm shift, where Russian companies could take you, but was a terrible business model and would not be considered success so far. Nothing against Uber/Lyft but compared to all other things in this infographic, I do not think they fit the narrative.

Not to discourage you from the scientific advancements, which I also believe will happen eventually, but I do not see how us mining the astroid belt happening in our lifetime in a "profitable" way.
We went to the moon in 1968, and had plenty of advancements since, only showing us how much more work we need to do to even go beyond our nearest neighboring planet (with only 54.5 million kilometer distance), let alone making a trade route to the astroid belt of 300-400 million kilometers away. That is just reaching there; let's not forget the challenges of navigating through the belt without the gravitational assistance of a major moon-like objects, setting up shop, delivering mining equipment, safely shipping the payload ...
I just don't see it happening in the next decade or two, it hurts me to say this but we just are not ready yet.
Also to compare this to Earth mining, it is not like gold reserves are very limited. There are tons of gold known to exist on Earth within the lower layers, but mining those are not worth it yet. Somehow I feel like those would be still cheaper than mining the 16 Psyche.

I never looked at it that way, and this brings up so many interesting estimations we can do. Quick question though, when you say


Do you mean "lower bound estimation" instead of upper bound, or perhaps you mean "upper bound estimation of the mining capital flow"?  I guess I am lost in terminology here, and what you refer to is "Inflow Cap" in the chart you shared (which is fantastic btw).
Reason why I would call it lower bound is because all coins mined would most likely be sold at market price, but those who bought it and sold it for profit years later are actual indications of more money flowing, right? I.e. if today I buy 1 btc from someone who got theirs from a miner for $1,000, technically there is an inflow of $7,000 into the network if calculated in a cumulative manner. I guess "realized cap" is more of a metric I would prefer to watch in this case.

For late adapters (like me) it indeed is, but not for lots of early adapters. I know few such individuals who have over 100 Bitcoins, mostly from mining back in the day or buying very cheap, then forgetting about it for years. Two of them quit and retired last year when bitcoin reached 14K\~ish so we had lots of conversation over the topic. I just wished somebody told me about it few years ago :(
There was this one poor soul though, who mined like 140 bitcoins like other coworkers, but kept it all in his harddrive and forgot they were there when he sold his machine. He always had the saddest look whenever the conversation started around bitcoin.

You are going down a dangerous path my friend. Not because believing in bitcoin, but because you are betting all on black/red. 
Please, please, please diversify. If bitcoin reaches where you and I believe it should, even %10-20 of your portfolio would be enough to keep you afloat, if not you are losing a significant portion of your savings but will survive regardless. Go for index funds, emerging markets, (probably not much bonds). Still high risk but keep most of your money in more stable investments until the widespread adoption happens. Keep buying bitcoin but only in relatively small increments.
If you do what you propose however, you are either going to get crazy rich, where the impact of the extra cash you get is marginal, or you will go broke and end up wasting most important years of your life for your retirement.

This is a fantastic point of view. Yes indeed the elasticity of coins make a huge difference, so we can say not all coins are equivalent in market's eye given their owner. As I mentioned in a part of my comment there are for instance folks who would never sell their coins for fiat, so from exchange point of view their coins are as good as the lost ones.
What I mainly assume however is that miners coins are mostly in the "have to sell" range, since they have real recurrent costs and they have to balance their sheets unlike us folks who park their "unneeded" cash. This means I assume the market sell pressure of a retail purchaser is much lower then miners, and would only do so after a particular price point is reached rather than making arbitrary market sell orders. The reason why I think newly minted coins are important and decrease of the ratio they have over the "active" coins is important is mainly because of this.
tldr; ideally I should be comparing the newly minted supply cut to a portion of the total coins volume where sale for fiat is likely, and in that metric 10.5m vs 18.375m gap might not be that big if most retail owners are not willing to sell on a "market order".

Gold is not valuable because it has industrial uses, on the contrary gold has been valuable way before modern industry was even built, for a simple reason: it was very limited and shiny enough to be used as status symbol. Nobody had proper uses for gold during ancient times, heck even in middle ages. It was a shitty metal to smith for weapon/armory purposes and was only used to show people how you could afford to have 'this much' of such a rare element.
Compared to that at least bitcoin has some transactional value, and in terms of limited amount it even surpasses gold since it has a hard cap (while gold have been mined for centuries and still have cores to be mined).
Regardless, I feel like it is pointless to compare gold vs bitcoin since bitcoin is not created for the purposes of intrinsic value type asset but for seamless p2p transaction.

I wouldn't say so. Sure if you look at short term windows it looks volatile (ups and downs unpredictably) but over the last 8 years it has been consistently going up. Many of the suggested investments above (like long term bonds, house etc) are long term plays so if we were to consider we might as well say that crypto can be considered for a decent safe haven for a portion of your portfolio.
Personally I try to keep %10 of my portfolio in bitcoin. I would love to do more but I am a big believer of diversification and cannot justify to own more.

I am a bitcoin believer, but honestly speaking nobody in those countries are keeping their savings in their local currency cash so this is not a fair comparison.
Either they keep it in their banks, which have very high interest rates to cover for the inflation, or they keep it in \`stable\` currencies like USD, EUR, JPY. It is not even unheard of for those countries to keep actual physical precious metals (like gold).
If we want to compare, we should compare bitcoin over the aforementioned currencies, though I do not even see the point of comparing.
Imho bitcoin is investment to our future, where we have the freedom to do transactions as we want it. Whether it underperforms our outperforms particular fiat in the short run is not important.

One major thing I did when I started was to move my purchase habits from paycheck-to-paycheck to more frequent purchases. This really relieved me of the stress of whether I bought at the wrong time.
I.e. when I get my paycheck I move 5% of my money to the exchange to buy, but don't buy Bitcoin all at once, instead I split it into 6 equal date periods in my mind and buy in 6 installments. Since most credible exchanges charge in percentage but not actual trigger it makes no difference on the fees you pays. You can even do this daily, heck maybe every morning and evening if you are really into watching the price daily. 
Another thing I realized was that it really doesn't matter when happens to the price today or tomorrow if your horizon is at least few years down, so I prepared myself that even if it went down 90% I would still keep it for years to come. That really prepared me to any downside I might experience.

Us latecomers are not that unrealistic, those are mostly memes and fun. 
Anybody with a grain of reasoning knows that Bitcoin cannot go 10,000x at this point barring global scale catastrophes, that it is extremely unlikely to go 1000x, perhaps possible to go 100x over a long period of success, and has a decent chance to go 10x. So yes, $100 investment won't go far, heck even $50,000 investment is hard to get us where you early folks managed to land. That being said, better late than never. I would much rather put my excess cash to something like Bitcoin with adoption potentials wide open than put it into other risky investments.

For those of you who are rich enough (good for you) yet still keep their coins in the exchanges, keep in mind that most exchanges have daily limits for withdrawal. I.e. Coinbase have $10,000 limit so you barely can move 2.5 bitcoins a day. If you somehow has 10+ make sure to plan ahead and start moving day by day.
For the rest of us who have less than 2.5 bitcoins ... well life is simpler :)

Disclaimer: I believe in bitcoin so might be a bit biased, but will try to comment as unbiased as possible.
I feel like sub $1000 is pretty hard to justify, since the entire market cap of bitcoin would then account for less than $18B. We are talking about a currency adopted by millions of people here. Even most silicon valley tech companies worth more than that, and they do not necessarily have the amount of developers that back bitcoin. The amount of investment bitcoin gets and technology alone should be worth more than $50B. On top of that I see nothing but good news on adoption growth. More ATMs, more Lightning nodes open up everyday, more ways to spend the coins etc etc.
My distress bottom is somewhere around $2200-2400 level, that is if people panic sell. Around those values you would always find people who would buy it in bulk as they would see it worth more just in Goodwill.

Assuming a vocabulary of 45,000 words, first word cannot collude to anything, second has 1/45,000 chance of repetition, third has 2/45,000+(1/45,000 \* 1/45,000)-but lets ignore the second epsilon part for simplicity-... until  you have 23/45,000+(epsilon)
so we have (23+24)/2-1=275+sum(all\_epsilons) so say \~280 out of 45,000 chance, or a little over half a percent change of at least one repetition. Only one repetition won't break the game since 23! is still a huge number (single order of magnitude lower only) and at-least two repetition becomes polynomially less likely, so I would call it OK to ignore.
Edit: seems like vocabulary size of BIP 39 is 2048, which makes these odds \~280/2048 so there is a good 13.6% chance that "at least one word is repeated" unlike my original assertion.

Assuming world has 2 billion people who have the disposable income to buy Bitcoin today (see rough calculation below) and assuming 1 million+ bitcoins are totally lost today (estimation vary between 1.2m to 4m, but let's be safe), in a world where Bitcoin is a regular part of our lives (i.e. where everyone holds some just like they have regular currency or other assets in a diversified way), **you can easily be in this group if you have 0.01 Bitcoin. You already have 10x of that so pat yourself on the back for being already way ahead :)**
As long as you don't sell it and keep it above 0.1, you are making a bet on the future where Bitcoin is a standard asset among all others known today.
Assuming anybody with purchasing power in the world is from G20 (which is a huge stretch obviously) you get 4.6 billion people where roughly 70% of them are adults (source\*).  If we exclude the high "disposable income inequality" countries since they make the data very noisy (i.e. many people in Brazil does not have the disposable income to even buy 0.001 bitcoin today, with cutoff of 0.45 or above, source \*\*):
\- China (0.46), with 1.3b population
\- Mexico (0.48), with 110m population
\- Brazil (0.52), with 200m population
\- South Africa (0.0.67), 75m population
we end up excluding 1.7 billion people out (hoping that these would even out with the rich of above countries somewhat balancing out the inequality of the medium tier of the rest of G20.
Thus we have 4.6-1.7\~=2.9 billion people of which 2 billion of them are adults.

Makes sense after thinking about it. Thanks for the info I learned sth cool today :)

I can understand the Bitmain and Consensys but why is CoinBase collapsing? Aren't they making money on the exchange, meaning as long as some people buy/sell they will get their cut. Why should bitcoin price matter to them? I'm sure I'm missing something!

I'm confused on how the study your source is referring to can be valid. Especially these 2 items seem to contradict each other:
\- Almost **22 million bitcoin wallets** have been set up globally.
\- An estimated **five percent of Americans hold bitcoin**.
Even if each wallet were to belong to an individual person (which we know is not the case) there are 249M adults in USA, so we are talking about 12.5M Americans using bitcoin. More than %50 compared to the rest of the world. And it only gets more dramatic since wallet&lt;-&gt;individual relationship is not one-to-one.
Frankly, I doubt that 1 in 20 Americans are using bitcoin right now.
