I didn't watch the video but I always thought it was a stupid argument. How much electricity does the regular financial system use for their computers and offices? I guarantee it's a lot more than the Bitcoin network

It's meant to be used as a currency without any banks getting involved. Near instant payment from any point in the world to any other point without having to deal with bullshit wire transfer fees, conversion rates, know your customer bullshit, etc

I also never heard of this dude until recently but been into cryptos since about same time as you.
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:57:52
Yeah but that's only recently because Bitcoin suddenly became the next fidget spinner and the network can't handle the influx of new users

Trevena when it looked like kratom was gonna be banned and they were testing a drug that's a synthetic version of one of the alkaloids in kratom. And Ambarella because I figured there would be more demand for their chips in stuff like quadcopters
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:10:14
Ok good luck

We all need to work on local meshnets and then link em up

This is a pretty good article about what Bitcoin is supposed to be and some history of it 
@_date: 2017-12-28 07:43:56
I had Bitcoin in 2012. Sold the last of it last year. Didn't buy anymore til August
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:22:12
Will mime for Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:41:24
That asshole owes me 3BTC
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:48:20
I traded my litecoin for Bitcoin last year and then sold that for $1700 which I used to buy stocks. Those stocks have lost money. Wish I'd have kept at least a bit of my coins. Oh well, got back in recently and I'm up. Been casually into this shit since 2011 or 12 and haven't lost my initial fiat yet
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:30:48
Huh? Where is the quote from and what are they talking about?
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:28:42
Is this the origin of the "this is a good thing for Bitcoin" meme? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:50:08
Uh wut
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:16:26
Yeah ok
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:44:06
I found his email address and Instagram account. He hasn't responded, just like I never got a response from bitfloor's email support
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:24:45
Bitcoin is at like $17,000. What do you consider moon status if not this???
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:43:21
Why do you have that asshole from Bitfloor working at your company?
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:58:18
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:42:12
Get paid for your work in bitcoin. Buy bitcoin off of local people. Mine it.
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:24:19
Ok but what does Laszlo do? This version of what?
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:19:38
Is this a serious question?
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:52:46
Call it fraudcoin

Check out r/personalfinance if you don't have a savings account with a decent interest rate. Off the top of my head I can only think of Ally but I know there are others with good rates too. That's if you plan on just having your money sitting in an account for rent payment anyway
@_date: 2017-02-23 20:48:59
Sold my litecoin and Bitcoin for trevena and ambarella stock. Oops. Down like $500

Rich foreigners buy apartments in places like London, New York, Sydney, and Vancouver as investments and physical safes. They might visit, but usually the apartments remain empty and fuck over the locals by driving up housing costs.
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:27:10
More than that would be lovely so I can buy more
@_date: 2018-03-05 05:28:22
I had a part time job where I was going to ask my employer for pay in bitcoin, but then I quit. So I guess I don't have anything to contribute?
@_date: 2018-02-26 05:39:12
 was the first exchange and predates the pizza purchase
@_date: 2018-02-28 07:11:38
This is the best reply I saw 
@_date: 2018-02-22 09:44:52
Yes. October 2016 to August 2017

@_date: 2018-02-18 21:14:24
iirc the first exchange based the value on how much electricity it cost to mine
@_date: 2018-02-26 05:36:34
Not a bad deal. Somebody had to be the first person to use Bitcoin as a currency.
@_date: 2018-02-04 08:08:42
The app has been around for years, but buying and selling bitcoin with it is new, which is a big deal since it's a popular app.
@_date: 2018-02-25 07:37:31
This! I've been trying to explain this to people for years but most don't get it or don't care!
@_date: 2018-02-26 05:37:49
No. That came after

2011 I moved to Australia m I'm American. I filled out an online form on Commonwealth Bank's website and talked to someone over the phone. When I arrived I showed up at a local branch and picked up a debit card and deposited cash. Very easy
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:17:41
Lol thanks
@_date: 2018-04-30 05:07:51
No shit
@_date: 2018-04-26 08:11:12
Did this guy get the public into bitcoin or what? I barely heard of him until last year
