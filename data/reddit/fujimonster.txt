No, it's not down from $30 billion, read the article.  Op linked to an article that covered on the top 3 at $6.4 billion. Your link totals all banks with the top 10 alone at $7.5 billion for 2016.  So hardly down 79%.

Im sure the lose of your funds will bring them to their knees, good job.

There is no open/close on the crypto market's, the exchanges trade 24x7.
@_date: 2018-06-12 10:18:01
That was years ago and they paid fines for that.
@_date: 2018-03-21 16:18:12
That stopped years ago so stop trolling

Calling a guy a dumbass for having an opinion is pretty childish .  Having protections for money deposited isn't a bad thing, it's what gives people confidence their money is safe even if the bank is doing something with it on their end.  If you don't like traditional banking, don't use it.  But no one will call you a dumbass for doing it.

If people who cashed out more than 20K in cash and did not pay their taxes, who cares if the IRS goes after them.  Doesn't matter how you feel about taxes, the IRS, the US government -- it's still the law.

It's a banking regulation, they didn't do it just because.

coinbase is sticking with the main chain and won't support the fork, I for one don't see a problem with that. If you support BCC, etc. then you are probably in the wrong place.

What are you, 12 years old ?

Since you have no clue how an exchange is run nor the rigors of moving millions of dollars from cold storage so it can be transmitted nor zero evidence they are being slow on purpose,  you should clean up your attitude and be an adult.

It was 110 million , not 400 billion. And wells bought them more than 5 years ago , not "just got bought ".  Get your shit straight.  
@_date: 2017-07-08 01:00:41
Maybe they gave up asking because everytime they did, coinbase went offline and was unresponsive. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 17:34:53
but what specifically is your problem with coinbase?  You haven't given anything beyond 'middle finger' and 'cucks'....
@_date: 2017-07-03 15:58:54
Uh, not just coinbase and exchanges. if a government says that business cannot take any crypto currency as payments and banks that operate within their boarders are barred from transferring funds to any crypto currency exchanges and the like, they have just regulated bitcoin,etc within their borders.

Yes I am going to take financial advice from a guy called elitegamerbros.  Move along 
@_date: 2017-07-30 15:00:31
Lol, do they think everyone can see all the account verification procedures and cold storage processes ? It's like everyone here is an expert on their backend or something.    Still bitching about the delay , then it's your own fault.  You've only know for more then a week what you needed to do .

It is the standard because it's a banking regulation:

It can happen because not all transactions are presented in the order you walked from store to store.  Sometimes your ACH's ( debit cards ) may not get settled until the next day by the clearing out.  Your original 'memo-post' of the amount drops off then the real charge could be present sometime after.  This can affect the order of your transactions.  Happens alot when you buy gas or ate at a restaurant . The pre charge will drop off when the final charge shows up a day or two later -- and can mess with the order.

At this point I think they do it on purpose whenever there are big swings in the prices.  They just can't be that bad at running things.

Stay away from btcquick as well.  Waiting over as day now for them to send my coin-- nothing.  Won't respond to repeated emails as well.

Banks aren't going anywhere, don't be dumb. Just because you trade in bitcoin doesn't mean millions of other people will.   I would say 99% of people trust their banks, prefer the ease of being able to bank locally, get their money out of an atm on the corner and being able to talk to someone about any account issues.
