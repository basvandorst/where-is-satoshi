Hope you get your BTC back, I had a similar issue when I removed my fingerprint from my phone and it removed the breadwallet too. but I was lucky to get it back as I wrote the memorable words down!!! Write off your losses and consider it an expensive lesson learnt the hard way. Take care and ensure you back up in the future!

I've never had an issue with shapeshift.io, if anything they're always legit as heck. :D

There's too damn many fake apps popping up. Use a trezor wallet/keepkey or anything reliable. I nearly lost £200 in breadwallet last night and I thought I had bad day! :I

I wish you luck with obtaining your funds back also.

I bought a Gaming PC from Scan UK with BTC before and it worked fine. No matter the scale of price I believe BTC can provide a flawless payment option that many should consider using more.

Exactly this. People get put off badly when their trouble burns a hole in their pocket, no matter what size.

I've personally used Localbitcoins enough to say it's very safe, but exercise caution and only have your BTC  and use them IMMEDIATELY, don't leave them there for ages... When your BTC is on a wesbite showing balance, it's there but it's also an invisible IOU which could turn unredeemable given the fact the website goes haywire at any point. You never know!

For that I'd have to trust the user sending me BTC, or it has to be a low value purchase; a cup of coffee.
