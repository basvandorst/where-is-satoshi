if you watch the video it goes into what you are talking about actually. But ya I get what you mean. 
@_date: 2018-08-25 05:12:39
You guys all forgot the one thing I DIDN'T say..... which was being Bullish. I'm not bullish on Bitcoin from these levels. We will not break another high.

this post got 400 views in a hour because of it lol
@_date: 2018-08-08 17:15:22
is that right? show me who's analysis you think is correct, an well compare them. :) I'm always right mother fucker 
@_date: 2018-08-20 21:50:58
in the stock market TA=BS .... in crypto (which is 100% speculation/ none fundamental) TA is actually the most valuable thing there is. There is no value here. Just people making guesses. Therefore TA is paramount. 
@_date: 2018-08-07 22:30:13
thank you sir 
@_date: 2018-08-16 05:30:51
I understand that covering a short position includes buying back. But you have to realize that I'm looking at the volume and not seeing enough pure buy action. its mainly short covers. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 17:14:14
So you tell me I'm wrong for being bearish, then this guys says "next stop moon!" and you tell him he did good TA??? Dude. this guy is dead wrong. You are fucking delusional. Wake up and smell the coffee. The funny thing is, you actually do believe that this picture is better then my analysis. You are god damn stupid 
@_date: 2018-08-03 16:51:04
mmm idk man. I would assume that institutions are planning to let the price fall. They want people to think its a scam, that way they can ahold of the supply that they want, before the next major bull run. also watch this video, it explains it. go to 2:28

@_date: 2018-08-28 15:59:53
Yes, my point is that you are a miserable bag holder, and your actions support my theory. You set out to discredit every post I make. Are you jealous? oh btw, go to my Instagram an check out my posts from 2014 ;) then well see who's really a bull. 
@_date: 2018-08-26 03:32:10
Diamondcuts, do you realize that I don't care what you say to me??? Do you realize that I will continue to post on the Bitcoin reddit as much as I want to? Do you realize that theres nothing you can do about it? 
@_date: 2018-08-10 23:24:40
your probably right. I assume that anyone who looks at my page will see that its me. But its more for click bate purposes. 
@_date: 2018-08-26 03:45:00
Not at all, your the one who's trying to control me, and I'm sure your feeling a bit salty now seeing this price action, right? Enjoy the bear market. Once we break below 6k you will realize who's opinion you should have been listening to. I hope you keep listening to Tom Lee &amp; John McAfee, and being lied to all the time. If you want good price predictions, subscribe to the youtube channel ;) ill cya on the downside

Say what you will but because of Technical Analysis, I bought in 2014, and sold in 2017. So. I'll continue to predict Bitcoin with extreme accuracy. You can go ahead and continue to stick your head in the sand and ignore the fact the Crypto is 100% TECHNICAL. Its ALL speculation. Which mean, its all about repeating patterns. Enjoy the bear market. 
@_date: 2018-08-28 02:34:07
You must like to hold onto bags hu? I'm willing to bet that you are in the red big time, considering how often you comment on my posts and down vote them. Is there something your trying to protect? 
@_date: 2018-10-18 23:01:28
there are thousands. But Kevin is the only one to actually make predictions that come true over and over again.... look at his track record. He's consistent. he doesn't flip flop and pander around like every other Crypto youtuber.
@_date: 2018-10-16 22:31:07
I agree 
@_date: 2018-10-18 22:55:54
Kevin Svenson has been extremely accurate about his predictions. Check out his past videos. He called the top an has been warning about this correction ever since. Kevin's predictions are BY FAR the most consistent of any crypto youtuber/ analyst 3 
@_date: 2018-06-10 19:45:26
There are no commercials in his videos. Not sure if copy striking him will do anything. Good Luck 
@_date: 2018-06-22 23:35:24
since the 20k top. He has predicted every top since 20k and has been warning about this drop below 6k for months.

 �� its not a throw away baby 
@_date: 2018-06-26 23:39:14
yeah, but go look at his track record. Hes a no bullshit analyst. hes been calling for this correction since January. People like Tom Lee &amp; John McAfee are telling people to buy, so that they themselves can cash out.

If he had told you (when btc was at 20k) that he thought BTC was headed for 2,500 this year, you would have laughed him out of the room. Don't act like you knew this was coming. Show us some of your own predictions that prove that you aren't as dumb as you sound. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 01:21:34
You have no track record. Therefore you do not get a cookie :)

I bet you I can find posts you guys made from December/ January where you talk smack on BTC Bears. Theres no way that you guys believed BTC was going down this entire time. I highly doubt that 
@_date: 2018-07-18 22:15:30
Yes its me lol, and no I never said that Stocks are not in a bubble. Never said that. I agree with your overall sentiment. I don't like the traditional financial system, I think its total garbage. Fractional Reserve Banking is going to ruin/ enslave the world. I do not trust banks, or governments. That is why I love Bitcoin. Yes, I love bitcoin. But that doesn't mean I can't be bearish on it. 
And tell me sir, when was the last time you spent your bitcoin? How often do you actually use your Bitcoin as money? Let me answer that for you. Just about never. Maybe a handful of times just for fun. But you plan to hold onto that Bitcoin for dear life, right? 
Bitcoin goes up in price because people buy and hold it, and they don't spend it. If people spent their bitcoin throughout everyday life, then the price would be very stable. 
Its clear that you do not really understand the nature of Crypto "Currencies". NOBODY uses them as money. Its only used as money as a novelty. For fun. People use it as "a hedge against the traditional markets" .... but what most people like you don't understand, is that Bitcoin has gained in value ALONGSIDE the stock market. Bitcoin has benefited from the stock market rising. There is a direct correlation. And as much as you don't want to hear this ... Bitcoin will fall with the stock market. The value that was created into the stock market since 2008 was transferred into Bitcoin.
Think Critically. 
@_date: 2018-07-06 16:39:41
Exactly 
@_date: 2018-07-06 16:40:07
You think he's awesome? So I'm assuming you have been taking his advice. How much have you lost so far? lol 
@_date: 2018-07-21 01:36:23
You can buy an hold. Thats fine. More power to you. But the fact of the matter is that Crypto is a speculation market. and if you don't think Crypto is purely a speculation market then you have no understand of that state the technology is in right now. Watch the video on the home page of my youtube channel, it explains it in detail .... The fact that all the Crypto move in the same direction all the time is 100% proof that its all speculation ..... which is why Technical Analysis is paramount. TA is paramount in a speculation market .... Now sit back an watch the price drop.
@_date: 2018-07-18 20:37:38

"The highest form of *ignorance* is when you reject something you don't *know"* 
@_date: 2018-07-21 03:11:35
I agree with that 100%. I'm not a day trader. My entire youtube channel is based on Technical Analysis, yes. BUT, what I have stated in all my earlier, highest viewed videos, is that I am not buying until we get below $4,500 ... once we get below there, I will slowly average in, an then hold it long term. I am a long term investor. My videos might make me seem like a trader, but I'm not. Long term investor here.

omg! your a detective! Congrats! 
@_date: 2018-07-18 22:35:24
Yes I honestly should have also said that stocks are in a bubble as well. Because they are. But we both agree that our current system is fucked beyond all hell. And we both love bitcoin. we just disagree on its current state.
