I laughed more than I should've.

I am honestly super impressed, will use your app from now on! It's so much easier and less of a struggle to always set an exchange and fees etc in the other common crypto portfolio apps... the only thing I'd like to point out is that it would be absolutely awesome if you could try to integrade an *OLED style* under customization settings. Basically just make the background 100% black. It looks so good on OLED phones and as a graphic designer I really love apps that have such a feature. I think it wouldn't be a big deal to integrate something like that? Maybe even a *lite style* where it's mostly white/light grey, I guess some people would like that aswell. Anyways, I rated 5/5 on the play store!

Thanks! I will check it out later when I'm at home and will leave some feedback for you :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:26:02
Is there any cloud sync or something similar? Lets say I loose my phone, how can I restore my portfolio for tracking?
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:49:23


I'd honestly rather not do that, because I'm talking about a 5 digit sum in total. But thanks for the info tho.

What helped me the most: Pull out more than you put into crypto after a certain profit. Once you did that you can sleep well at night without the fear of loosing anything, you literally don't give a fuck anymore since you know you will win in the long term anyways... and even if not, you still mad eprofit and had fun doing so. Win-win!

Thats bs, first of all it wasn't his life savings and nor was it a Trezor.

Same in italy, unless you make a profit of 51k€ a week!
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:31:51
Good choise! I'm currently deciding on what car I should get next year, either this one or a Mercedes A250 Sport. Enjoy the car :)
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:18:18
My portfolio used to be 40% BTC a few months ago and now its like 80% BTC without adding anything because of the huge pricegain recently.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:17:05
base model here in Italy is around 27.000€. I agree, it does look very expensive, but its priced very well for what you get ;)
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:25:06
Have fun carrying that around
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:03:36
it's sarcastic.
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:06:29
Well, since that profit was surely not
made over a period of just 7 days, I doubt it would be a problem. Usual withdraw daily limit is just 10k anyways, so splitting that across multiple, smaller payouts should be just fine. After all you can easily proof that a profit of 51k€ a week was not surpassed. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:14:41
I got a Nano S for 2 months now and I'm super satisfied.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:37:13
its not a 50k+ car tho
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:20:08
It's userfriendly, does what it's supposed to do and the price is fair imo (at least compared to Trezor)
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:37:28
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:20:43
You're welcome, I searched around a lot recently, because I plan to cash out a good amount and I want to avoid getting in trouble for not paying any taxes, but so far I haven't found anyone telling me that I have to pay anything (unless its over 51k€ a week of course).
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:35:21
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:47:50
I asked my girlfriends dad about this, he used to be part of the "Guardia di Finanza" and he did some research for me. 3 sources confirmed that unless you gain a profit higher than 51.645€ within 7 days, you don't have to pay any taxes, otherwise it would be 26%. Those soruces were: recently printed newspaper about finance, a trusted italian website about finance and an ex collegue of my gf dad who still works in the italian tax-sector. So I wouldn't say its just "a single opinion".
I would recommend to document everything nonetheless, but as of now, there's nothing to pay.
@_date: 2018-05-14 17:04:12
you're welcome.

Why is he a hero to give people easier access to drugs? 
@_date: 2018-03-27 06:22:48
That's like the worst explanation I've read in ages...
@_date: 2018-03-02 04:24:13
So does GDAX.
@_date: 2018-03-02 10:06:29
So does GDAX, why do people forget that.
@_date: 2018-03-11 18:05:31
You forgot to mention the pesants over at want to kill Bitcoin... lmao
@_date: 2018-03-27 05:30:27
How about the fact he made millions and didn't report to the IRS? Of course thats highly illegal. I don't get why people here call him a hero, it's just a smart criminal that got caught.
@_date: 2018-03-02 04:23:51
So true!
@_date: 2018-02-16 17:44:01
50k€ a settimana max.
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:27:38
Not the smartest, your friend? How can you possibly do that "by accident".
@_date: 2018-03-27 07:01:52
It's like calling a murderer a hero because he uses a painless method to kill it's victims. Yeah okay, it's better than most other murderers, but it's still not the right thing to do and highly illegal. That's an extreme example, but a criminal is a criminal and I can't imagine calling a con like Mr. Ulbricht a *hero*. He also made millions with this and obviously didn't report to the IRS, of course he is in jail for fraud and all the other shit he's done. That's how I see it at least...
@_date: 2018-03-25 08:23:13
Made my day haha
@_date: 2018-03-14 08:26:35
I disagree, it's fine if you hold less than like 100 bucks on an exchange. Larger sums however should be transfered asap imo. I also belive that more coins get lost due to people loosing their private key or simply don't have access to their funds anymore than by exchanges getting hacked.
@_date: 2018-03-27 10:13:15


@_date: 2018-03-02 10:07:02
0.90€ for SEPA, I can handle that.
@_date: 2018-03-27 08:23:31
It's also easier. I wouldn't know where and how I could get my hands on drug XY, but on that market place you can find all sorts of things. At least from what I heard.
@_date: 2018-02-09 08:27:27
What 60min video?
EDIT: oh you meant *60 minutes* the show, nvm I was confused.
@_date: 2018-03-27 05:54:24
I din't see that being a problem tho.
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:41:47
For comparison: thats more than what Nvidia made...
@_date: 2018-03-27 14:15:00
Or maybe... because I don't care about prices of drugs since I don't do them...? If you support it's consumption and what it does to humans, I feel honestly very sorry for you. You're tough talking here on Reddit, but how much did you actually do in public and speak out loud against your government? I really wonder.
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:55:57




Sums it up. You literally just repeated my previous comment. I don't feel sorry for people who make mistakes like that by accident.
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:37:46
We hit over 0.8 trillion with BTC at less than 20k$, so no shit Sherlock.
@_date: 2018-03-27 11:05:39
At least I don't support a druglord :)
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:01:46
Moral of the story: buy low, sell high!
@_date: 2018-03-27 14:54:54
Wow, starting to insult me because of my personal opinion regarding drugs. Good job! I do care about human live, but I don't see why **cheaper drug prices and regulate them less** will HELP people avoiding them, this makes no sense in my eyes. If you can't explain it in a simple way, you clearly have no idea what you're talking about.
@_date: 2018-02-06 12:58:08
Welp, I guess the time has come... Just transfered a couple grand to my Bitstamp account.
@_date: 2018-03-27 11:13:39
Enjoy living in your bubble where everyone is evil except for you.
@_date: 2018-07-23 16:47:06
Needn't, literally the first time I hear that word.
@_date: 2018-07-19 09:04:56
Exactly right.
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:51:20
How can you buy a coin worth a fraction of BTCs price and think its Bitcoin you're buying? It's like buying a GPU on eBay for 50€ and you don't realize that it's just the package. Do people not have any common sense?
@_date: 2018-02-09 08:46:10
Oh okay, never heard of that show. Was confused, but thanks for clearing this up :)
@_date: 2018-07-22 10:22:09
Looks like out of a horror game.

@_date: 2018-04-02 19:11:18
I'd love to see a 5k$ BTC again, at this moment I highly doubt we won't see another massive bullrun way beyond previous ATH.
