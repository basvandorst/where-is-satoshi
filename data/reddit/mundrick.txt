People could withdraw bitcoins they never had, making their balances "-X" amount, so for this situation, probably around -60 bitcoins or something along those lines.

Thank you, yea I'm realizing it's going to be a bit tough, should be a fun one to write though.  Better to write about this since it's actually what I'm passionate about.

Lmao, I sell sneakers on the side too and whenever I get a "limited" drop I mess with my dad and tell him I've automatically made "X" amount of dollars.
What you just said is basically his response everytime (since I've become somewhat of a collector)  He tells me, "Is it in your pocket?" "Nope, then you only lost money so far." haha thank you for this, it's just so funny to me :P

I'm 17, senior in HS, and am well.. obsessed with this thing as well as it seems.  I've definitely gone through tons of kids in my grade arguing why bitcoin is so valuable, convinced a few teachers along the way, and gathering a group of friends to start doing some mining (hobby-ish).
Everyday it's basically the one thing I want to get accomplished at school: converting new people.  I've also gotten my Dad into bitcoin after telling him to buy for months and it's amazing when I can give him, a person who trades stocks on a daily basis, advice and info about the crypto market.
I must say this, one of the most enjoyable aspects of focusing so much on bitcoin with my friends is:
1) Seeing how miserable people get just because they want to dismiss the idea and refer to it's 0 intrinsic value
2) Listening to the abnormally stupid claims that some of my friends make (I had a friend tell me that since the Silk Road was shut down, bitcoin was destined to fail, and so was I in my investment)
Bitcoin has also definitely shaped my interests while applying into engineering schools; I had a primary focus on aerospace/mechanical, but now I'm extremely focused on comp sci and the like, but who knows if that'll change haha..

Yea I'm more or less talking if I initially bought from coinbase, went through a period of trading, making money, etc. and then withdrawing from there.  I'm not sure why he wanted to know that, but he was trying to connect it to the taxes he pays on stock profits, so maybe if Coinbase is reporting a 1099 and I paid taxes I'd be paying double taxes? Not sure honestly, I'll have to ask him tomorrow again.  
Thanks anyways!
