until you accumulate over 500 bucks, I would just use a free online wallet you control the key, I used Blockchain personally.   Free and pretty simple to set up for small amounts, eventually you can buy a hardware wallet once you start stacking those coins ��

the hardest thing to do is HODL when you are sitting on fat profits, imagine the people that bought at 100...!

I doubt it, from what I hear, the institutional investment interest is picking up momentum 
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:42:50

45 here, bitcoin is the only investment that interests me at all right now...am I going to buy over priced, risky stocks and bonds? Over priced real estate?  Maybe cash and earn zero?? no way!  bitcoin every day of the week and twice on Sunday!  Seriously , for 10% of my investments, FYI
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:35:58
laughing my ass off, suckers!
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:52:59

@_date: 2017-11-16 23:07:27
I couldn’t be happier with bitcoin’s performance, it has exceeded my expectations for return on investment.  My portfolio is up 2000 in last 24 hrs, life is good��

@_date: 2017-11-14 01:27:37
If I could choose, I would like a slow steady rise too
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:49:42
yeah up 6%? why?
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:49:28
start with a small amount if you have a lower risk tolerance and continue to learn and educate yourself about the technology 
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:02:59
no way..ha ha ha
