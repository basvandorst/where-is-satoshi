That’s a very unfair statement. I’m a millennial and I’m not that stupid.

Not going to comment about my net worth, but do you really assume all millennials are on the lower end? Living in the DC area and having a lot of friends in IT, myself included, I can tell you that’s not always the case. Contrary to popular belief, there are millennials that are actually smart with their money and make wise investments.

I think it depends on where you are. For example, I live just outside one of the biggest US cities with a lot of government and IT jobs (I think you can figure that one out) and everyone around here seems to have their shit together. This place is littered with yuppies making $100k+ and living a good life while be financially smart.

Am millennial, but not an idiot. Only about 1-2% of my net worth is in crypto, with no plans of adding more any time soon. Of that, 90% is in BTC and ETH.
