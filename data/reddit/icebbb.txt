There is enormous amount of trolls (blind fanatics?) on this sub lately.
@_date: 2014-12-17 15:46:49
No clue why you are downvoted...
@_date: 2014-12-03 12:17:04
You said it before, but you did not answer any of my questions...
1) If Blockchain is arbitrally own by single entity (bank as you suggest), they do not need to loose money on mining. They may use just cheap internall database.
2) In my opinion alternative Blockchain is not possible due to its problems to get mature (enought hash power to make it secure). Nowadays everybody knows that ASIC's can be made in few months, and with little effort one can build enough to overtake other Blockchains. Ofcourse if it is even worhtwile.

Bingo! Same as with any other currency worldwide in human history.
(Most people in this sub do not understand basic economy, but I see you are looking more for the truth not fighting. If you care to read, here are 2 free ebooks for you: 
They are short and great written, despite few decades old they will help you understand how money is created and from where it value comes).

No you are not, it is a Keynesian myth. Nowadays you are forced to spend as fast as possible. If not, in 1 year your money is worth less. Thanks to artificially low interest rates. 
If Bitcoin succeed we will have healthy economy where all investments come from savings, and no economy crisis ever happens. (except natural catastrophys etc.).
Google for: Austrian business cycle theory. There is also free ebook you will find worthy reading:

And that is really important news for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-12-01 16:20:00
This post is informative only. 40% of redditors are like "it is actually a good news", 40% "I told you so! this ponzi is dying!", only 20% took it as it should - another variable in current Bitcoin situation.
In my private opinion it is quite important, but I keep it private cause I don't want to be accused of spreading FUD nor inviting anyone to circle-jerking party.

Mining cost IS NOT SAME AS Printing money cost.
Mining cost IS Printing money cost + Anty counterfiting laws and police/fbi actions cost + All remittence costs (existence of all institutions handling fiat) + Central bank protecting national currency costs

0,25% interest rate for bank, 10% deflation for you :-)
@_date: 2014-10-24 13:55:16
So it is possible to do this also without using (spending) bitcoins for conversion?
@_date: 2014-12-17 10:52:04
1) Only 10% of gold mined is used in industry (source:  AND that percent did not increase when price surged from 300$ to 1921,05$. Furthermore Gold had value even when it was not used in industry at all.
2) You believe rareness is not case with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-12-17 10:15:38
Not really. If so, what gives gold its value?
@_date: 2014-09-08 15:20:55
Do not forget noise. Sound generated by fans also uses energy.

It is supposed to help deal with laundering money and selling stolen coins. If selling stolen coins is hard enough less people will lose their coins.
Nothing new here, they requested same KYC procedure completetion from me back in November, after several BTC deposits in a row.

"Bitcoin falling" - since when stating facts is badmouthing?
@_date: 2015-01-13 13:06:51
You are correct. But you will get only downvotes becouse you posted in r/Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-12-03 12:10:23
1) "better ideas are coming forward" - you mean what? Apple pay?
2) "Blockchain technology is what will thrive" - how are you going to build another blockchain from scratch? Without discovering of ASIC's while hashing is running not before it starts? Another "CPU only" delusional algorithm? One entity building ASICs and distributing them among thousands of independent users? Or maybe one entity (google? :-) ), that solely mines blockchain, and everybody trust them they will never fork?
DISCLAIMER: I can think of scenario that Bitcoin fails. But show me any where another Blockchain might succeed. 
EDIT: I suspect that OP created account just to start this topic, so I believe he is just trolling. But some merit answers are good for newcomers that might spot this topic.

Ingenico does not offer payment services in Poland, but they do produce terminals for other payment networks. Will Bitcoin be available only in few countries where they do offer payment services?

The good thing is that it will somehow clean name of Bitcoin. Rubbish articles stating that BTC is only good for illegal drug dealing will be over.
I am curious whether it will bump bitcoin price.

Now for several days you have no access to them, and the hacker can read them and use all information you have send...

Could you repost it to Custom Hardware section on Bitcointalk.org? 
There are several engineers that could confirm if it is another BFL scam.

Bitcoin is (almost perfect) materialization of Austrian Theory of Money. If not Libertarians, Ancaps, Minarchists and Agorists it would not survive to its current form. 
Please, read the book: "What governmant done to our money?" by M. N. Rothbard. It is freely available on the net. I am sure you will love it, and you will also understand why Bitcoin might become someday worlds currency.
You petition is something like "Please remove r/Jesus from r/Christmas subredits side bar!"

1) He thinks LONG TERM your advise is SHORT TERM.
2) Mt.gox is less important with every week, it may not be significant for LTC price wheter it is on gox or not.
3) Bitcoin is backed up by a whole economy of entrepreneurs. Litecoin price is driven ONLY by speculation.
