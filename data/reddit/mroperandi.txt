I think there is mistrust in the motives of the current debate. I personally feel like its more about greed that the interest of bitcoin and its users. Because of the distrust capital is flowing out of Bitcoin into other Alt-coins, around 3bn has been lost from Bitcoins Market Cap and the Alts have gained about 3bn.
The traders know bitcoin will continually lose market cap until the debate is resolved so why hold something that is going to drop in value.

You should have a diversified portfolio! Bitcoin, Precious metals, Land and hard assets. Possibly some stock (if you want to do your research). With your budget I would say possibly 2k in silver and 1k in gold then you are hedged.
Bitcoin is not going to be a smooth ride upwards it will have its ups and down. I believe the biggest risk is that Bitcoin is declared Illegal or the government goes after the exchanges for  tax or terrorism funding.
I would think of Bitcoin more as a way to store value and purchasing power rather than a way to make money.

That will give you the info for making a paper wallet - i suggest you download airbitz wallet on your phone and test sending tiny amounts of bitcoins to and from the wallet and phone.

I think the sentiment is a bit different this time. Last time we were here it was nosebleed territory. After the prices began to fall we didn't know if it would fall back to 100USD or 1USD. The herd mentality now is to Hodl your coins and not panic and we have gotten used to the 700 price.
But who knows!

They are damned if they do and damned if they dont. I don't drink the cool-aid and dont advocate putting more than you are willing to lose in any high risk investment. Leaving it in local currency is a much higher risk than storing it in assets.
Buying Bitcoin is a risk with upside and downside, I believe some day in the future Bitcoin will surpass $1200 this is not the last ever rally.

Bitcoin is more tried and tested and battle hardened - The altcoins are still very experimental and its impossible to say which might even be around in a few years. 
Bitcoin is the least likely to go to zero on its own - I think we can assume that if Bitcoin goes to zero all cryptos will go to zero but if and altcoin goes down Bitcoin will still be around.

1. Who promised anyone its a safe haven? Its an investment
2. Most people advocate dollar cost averaging where you buy a small amount every week or month, it protects you from price swings.
3. I think you are a bit naive if you think Indians living on 2 dollars a day are putting their "savings in the safe haven called Bitcoin at 1200?" -I dont even want to go into the demographics but most of these people dont even own bank accounts.
There are many Indian Billionaires and Millionaires that are using it primarily for capital flight and tax evasion as the government clamps down. 
It is a FACT that Bitcoin is the best performing currency for 2015 and 2016.
@_date: 2017-01-01 19:50:09
Because Bitcoin has only had 8 days in 8ish years with a price over $1000. We are close to the highest ever recorded price - so the overwhelming odds are that it will dip below 1000 again in the foreseeable future

The site owner / staff at any time can decide to transfer your coins out of his site. Or the site could go offline at any day. With Trezor you can recover your Bitcoins if you save your recovery seeds.
If the Trezor is stolen they will need your pin to get in, I think it has a fail safe to wipe after 20 incorrect pin entries.
If you have $100 worth of coins you don't need to worry so much about it, but if you have lots of Bitcoin you may want to keep them out of the out of reach.
You can look at Mycellium Wallet and Airtbitz which store your coins on your phone.

@_date: 2017-01-12 18:29:33
get a software wallet when you have a small amount of coin (a few dollars), and play around with it. send, receive between yourself and see the blockchain transactions.
With a website you have to "ask" them to send you your coins. Using a software wallet on your phone like mycellium you control your coins.
For super secure storage then get a trezor or ledger wallet. Even if you lose the wallet it can be recovered as long as you follow the instructions.
@_date: 2017-01-04 21:17:29
I use a ledger wallet because i'm super paranoid, I just wanted to ask for curiosity, have we had any history of a large scale phone hack that stole bitcoins?  Or a android or ios Wallet that lost peoples coins?

Your dad should consider the money spent and not invested once he hands it over to you. If he is cool with that, then why not. Although I recommend buying a range of assets like Precious metals and Bitcoin, buy a bit each month so you are not too exposed to any large price swings.
@_date: 2017-01-03 23:23:31
I think Bitcoins role would be more as a store of value for people, like keeping Artwork or Gold in the basement. Its fantastic for transferring that around the world.  I personally don't see it being that good for retail or every day transactions for quite a while yet, things may happen with the lightening network in the future but its going to take a very long time for the man on the street to find the benefits of adopting. 
World Governments will have to come after Bitcoin at some point and they will use Tax Avoidance and Terrorism funding as the main excuse. THey don't need to go after the blockchain or network, they only need to go after the exchanges. I trust us and the free-market to come up with a solution like anonymous exchanges to get around what ever restrictions they put on. 
I think many of us believe there is some massive financial disaster ahead that will meltdown the stock market and banking system. It will be Bail-ins and not Bail-Outs and we will see cash withdrawal restrictions like we saw in Greece. They will want to stop the haemorrhaging of a run on the banks and people transferring wealth out of Fiat into alternatives like Gold and Bitcoin.
Final point just like there are tax havens, there will be Bitcoin havens and they wont be able to control capital flow in bitcoins.
I also could be totally wrong and everyone panics and sells ending in BTC going to 0

Yes because ignorance is the best defence to logic. When you cant debate with facts, just claim ignorance. Bitcoin is not a safe haven, its one of the most volatile things you can put your money into, but it has tremendous upside. There are snake oil salesmen promising the world if you pump your money into Bitcoin but like any investment do your research, know the risks and dont put in more that you are willing to lose.
Your premise of Indians earning $2 a day rushing into Bitcoin just isn't  realistic on any scale.

Just use a Bitcoin ATM! They don't ask you for any personal information . There is usually small premium but its much harder to trace. 
if you want to be anonymous you can then anonymize your coins through the standard ways, like buy anonymous coins on an exchange and immediately sell them or splitting your coins through many wallets.

I think many of them are worried about a scenario where world governments "go after" bitcoin users and exchanges. They link it to terrorism funding and the entire weight and power of the US government tries to shut down the Bitcoin network. How many of us would risk mining in this scenario?
Gold and silver can be buried in the back yard when the government start the mass confiscations.
I think the best strategy is to have a good mix of hedges, don't go all in on any one. Long term Fiat is going to the toilet so we need to start planning

the Nano S has a screen for second factor authentication where the Nano uses a card with a table of words that. it will ask you to fill in some of the words from the original card as the second factor authentication.
You can use the ledger app to enroll the card to your phone and use codes generated on your phone instead of the word card.
Thats the main difference.

It depends how many Bitcoins you want to own vs how paranoid you are.
"I am interested in purchasing a Ledger Nano S but still want to understand why it doesn't have the same problems as a paper wallet."
1. Hardware wallets encrypt the keys on the device and it constantly generates new addresses in the background (which you dont need to worry about) you only deal with the software for sending and receiving.
Doesn't the device have a single public address which all transactions are sent to? 
2. No, it generates many addresses and it does it thing in the background so you dont need to do any management of this. When ever you request a receiving address it may or may not give you a previously used address.
"but still want to understand why it doesn't have the same problems as a paper wallet"
If someone steals your paper wallet they have access to all your keys, the hardware wallet is useless without your additional authentication.
"How does it avoid the problem of losing the remaining wallet balance after sending a payment?"
not sure what you mean here, you can send any amounts that you want. Paper wallets are like cheques, you can only create them and wholly cash them. You cant actually "send" bitcoins to a wallet from a piece of paper.

Maybe I'm in the minority and i'm not ashamed to say, I started buying years ago, because I was thinking Bitcoin will go to the moon. As I read the forums I get a sense of "Tulipmania" where we buy only because we believe that someone else will pay more for it at a later date.  Those that are investing/speculating/saving are they doing it mentally with a USD valuation or a BTC valuation, because 1BTC will always be worth exactly 1BTC. If the tide goes out and the fiat to BTC price collapses, you still have the same number of Bitcoins, but I think a large part of the speculators would be hurt.
 I think Bitcoin needs to be its own ecosystem, accumulate, spend and save and don’t get too excited or depressed about the fiat valuations.

Great explanation! I was mostly thinking about getting it in the hands of everyday people so they can use it and see the benefits.

that's sort of the whole point of Bitcoin - You are not going to convince an old sceptic like me that Mr Wall Street is a good custodian of my bitcoins. It will only end in tears, Mt. Gox taught us all to hold our coins.

" If so, is it reasonable to assume Bitcoin is a good investment to buy into at this price (£781.13)? "
In my opinion, the 2017 Italian banking crisis will pass quietly, it will be a case of lend and extend.
I think most of us believe there is a huge world debt crisis coming but it may be a bigger event like Deutsche Bank crash, Stock market crash, housing market crash that  that causes it. 
During that big crisis it will not be bank bailouts but bail-ins where they take depositors money and we get cash withdrawal limits to keep the system going -that's when we all assume Bitcoin will see colossal gains. So long term I think yes Bitcoin is a good investment at that price but you would may to be patient (years).
"Or are we still anticipating a January correction once speculators go?"
With the current financial system mess with no real price discovery mechanism - who knows what the correct price of Bitcoins are? I recommend you average in and buy a set amount of Bitcoins every month so you are not too exposed to price swings.
Many Bitcoiners like to have their coins stored securely in an hardware wallet locked in their safe. I don't know how it will work if we are to trust someone to manage them in an Exchange Traded Fund.

I agree with you and I don't think BFX will survive and its entirely possible it wont be their fault. Sadly BFX will have to pay for the crimes of previous exchanges like MtGox. There will be mass withdrawals if they are working again or they will never work again and the money is lost.

"So what old Jimbo here is doing is trying to make the case that any time the price of Bitcoin goes up, that constitutes "capital gain" and is therefore illegitimate and subject to confiscation." 
That's not how tax works - its only capital gains if you SELL back for fiat then that gain must be declared to Mr Taxman. Anyone that has withdrawn USD on coinbase is already in a very hairy situation. If you are stupid enough to have bought on coinbase and sold on coinbase for a profit - then make sure you have decalred it to the IRS.

While I believe he does not fully "get it" - I think he does understand tax enforcement. Last year only 802 people declared bitcoin on their US tax returns ( there are going to be massive capital gains against next years tax for those that took profits. What happens to the price when Coinbase gets subpoenaed by the IRS, people will have to sell to cover their tax liabilities.
