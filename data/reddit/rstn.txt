Yeah, be careful with that.

Equities currently have more downside risk than the USD or Bitcoin.

Thank you for your opinion.  I've given you nothing on which to judge my level of sophistication, and you seem rather condescending by nature.  So you will have to forgive me for dismissing your "advice".

Thanks.  That gave me some insight.  BitGo's javascript tool is creating a raw transaction and trying to send it to  with an extremely large URI.  The response coming back is "414 Request-URI Too Large".  I have to say, this is BitGo's recovery process?  This is what we are to use if BitGo suddenly disappears?  What if coinb.in suddenly disappears as well, or stops working as the case right now?  Does anyone have any idea of an alternate solution to work around this issue?  I have a curl command-line that submits the raw transaction, but I'm not sure what else I can do with it.

I got the transaction to go through.  But the transaction as BitGo's script created it is flawed!  I'm going to lose over 85 BTC now!  I created a fresh topic for this new discussion.  Can anyone help? :(
@_date: 2015-04-25 18:05:17
The email to support just went out about 8 minutes ago.  No response so far.

The script showed the full amount in the address (over 102 BTC) and a 0.0005 transaction fee and stated this full amount would be recovered.  While all outputs in the source address were included as inputs to the transaction, only a small portion of those were actually spent to the destination address.  It's puzzling.  The tool did not ask for an amount to recover, as it apparently only supports recovering the entire wallet.
This is stressing me out so much I can't even function right now.  Ryan, any update from your end?
@_date: 2015-04-25 18:07:47
Yes, the 1Jut... address is safe.
@_date: 2015-04-25 17:38:13
This is literally making me cry right now.  My family is not wealthy where we can just let this kind of sum go without much thought. :(
I can't believe BitGo's recovery script would create a transaction for all the unspent outputs at the address, and then not actually spend them all properly.  This is bullcrap! :(
I have no idea how I would go about finding the miner.  I thought this was impossible.  BitGo said their recovery script would send all the funds in the account to the address supplied.  I supplied that address, and I received just over 16 BTC to that address.  But the remaining 85.89984592 is lost.  The form on BitGo's recovery script asked what transaction fee I wanted to set, and I left it at the default 0.0005.  So BitGo creating a transaction with a fee of over 85 BTC is outrageous!

No refund yet.  "Bitmain has agreed to return the coins. Today is Sunday in China, so you may not receive them until tomorrow, but you will get your coins back."
@_date: 2015-04-27 19:56:43
That depends on how they were lost.  In this case, it was through the use of a defined process by a reputable corporation (BitGo).  They would have covered any losses.  If I did something stupid on my own, the coins may be lost forever.  There's a big difference there.

* 1) I created a BitGo wallet in April 2014.
* 2) I couldn't remember the wallet password used on the website.
* 3) I ran the offline BitGo recovery app on the wallet, figuring it would be better than trying further to remember the wallet password.  I had the Account KeyCard that BitGo said is the only thing required to recover the funds.
* 4) I entered all requested data into the app, and set the transaction fee to 0.0005 BTC.
* 5) The app created a raw transaction to be transmitted to the Bitcoin network, which looked like a long series of hex digits.
* 6) The transaction was transmitted.
* 7) I saw the wrong amount sent to my address, saw a transaction fee of over 85 BTC, and began to cry.
@_date: 2015-04-25 07:22:14
Ok, I managed to get beyond the issue I was having with the address.  The redemption script I had on the keycard was no longer supported.  By random luck I had an email they sent me at a later date when I added another wallet.  This had a json script that actually seems to work correctly, in that it finds the right addresses.
I am now stuck at a new point: after filling out the form completely and accurately with the user private key, backup private key, and everything else, and hitting the button to make it all happen, I just get a popup saying "No response."  I have tried it in Firefox from Linux and in Chrome from Windows.  Same issue.  Has anyone ever run into this issue before?
@_date: 2015-04-25 18:12:15
BitGo's web interface on their website only works for more recent wallets.  They have a legacy app at  for older wallets.  My wallet was created back in April of 2014, so I had to use that legacy tool.

Losing the coins, or having them all go to $0.01 without recovery, would definitely be a hit to our future.  This investment is long-term.  My risk assessment is that at current price Bitcoin has much more upside potential than the USD long-term, and much less down-side risk.
@_date: 2015-04-25 18:26:22
I just received an email reply from BitGo:

There are plenty of people with legacy wallets.  The new wallets have only been introduced fairly recently.  The legacy recovery app needs to be maintained while any customers have funds in legacy wallets.  The irony here is that I was trying to pull funds out of the legacy wallet and remove myself from this risk.  Instead I jumped right in. :(
@_date: 2015-04-25 22:37:36
Thanks!  I PMd you. :)
@_date: 2015-04-28 04:55:22
Because the process created by a corporation led to lost funds?
@_date: 2015-04-25 22:27:44
I just grabbed the raw transaction from the browser that ran the BitGo recovery script, which I still have open.  I used Chrome's dev tool to get it from the network tab.
I tried sticking the raw transaction here, but apparently it's too long for reddit [this is too long (max: 10000)].
I plugged the raw transaction in over at  and found that there is only a single output which is this:
    "out": [
        {
            "value": "16.37152845",
            "scriptPubKey": "OP_DUP OP_HASH160 c47a8fa21e7c82d6da678582945edcecffcaa486 OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG"
        }
    ]
So it looks like this is definitely an issue with either the BitGo recovery tool or the redeem script provided by BitGo. :(
@_date: 2015-04-25 17:58:27
Thank you for finding this out.  I sent an email as advised just now.  Maybe I will get lucky and they will have pity on me. :(
@_date: 2015-04-25 20:47:27
Thanks for your help Ryan.  If there is anything I can do to help, please let me know.  I could email you the redemption script if that would help.  Heck at this point since the wallet's empty I can send you the private keys as well and you can step through in a debugger if that makes it easier.
@_date: 2015-04-25 20:36:25
Wow, thanks.  I'm crossing my fingers!
@_date: 2015-04-25 22:37:48
Thanks!  I PMd you. :)
@_date: 2015-04-25 23:49:15
I have updated the original post.
The bug has been found. BitGo's legacy recovery tool uses an older version of a library that causes a 32-bit truncation of values. The end-result is a truncation of outputs on the recovery transaction. BitGo should have this fixed soon.
BitMain/AntPool and BitGo are in contact wrt resolving this erroneous transaction fee. BitGo's CTO personally contacted me and has assured the loss will be recovered. A rep for BitMain has also expressed confidence that the excess fee will be returned.
@_date: 2015-04-30 22:15:07
I'm going to leave out my own analysis and point you at one of your colleagues then.  I'm sure we came to the same conclusion via vastly different means.  But that's not really relevant.
@_date: 2015-04-25 18:02:16
I'd be ecstatic if it was sent to that same address.  That's where it was all supposed to be sent to by BitGo's recovery script. :(
