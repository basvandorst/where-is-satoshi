Well the high fees are a problem, wouldn't you say.  Are we all just supposed to be bitcoin fanbois and never voice concerns?

Sucks for people like me who run an online business that used to make sales in BTC and now nobody wants to pay the exorbitant fees to make a sub $10,000 purchase. Plus, credit cards give usually give your purchase a certain amount of insurance, so it's a double whammy. And we used to sell our merchandise for BTC. The last tea for crypto sale we made was in BCH.

I agree with you but the momentum is waning every moment.

I'm an online merchant and people don't buy shit with bitcoin... anymore.  I used to make sales in BTC but nobody wants to pay an extra 10% in fees.  Haven't had an order paid for in bitcoin in many months.  But, just had an order paid for in Litecoin last week.

I buy $20 a week &lt;shrug&gt;  Less than beer money.

Not everyone is in this for speculative value.  Just because it doesn't affect you doesn't mean it's not a problem.  As an online merchant it hits me in the pocket book.  I used to make sales in bitcoin, now I don't.  Sure, there are other cryptos that we can (and do) take but the infrastructure for those just isn't in place, but it's getting there quick and it's going to eat BTC's lunch if the solution isn't soon.

I'd have to see a good reason why it wouldn't keep doing what it's always done.  What's changed?  
It'll go up.  Then it'll go down.  Then... it'll go up again.  After a while, it'll go down.  Next it'll go back up, then down, up, then down, up, then down and back up again.  After which, it'll go back down.  If you're thinking it'll go back up after that, you're probably right!  Will it go back down then?  I think so.  But I also think that it'll go back up.  Or maybe down.  But then up and down and up... not sure when it stops.  It goes up because more people are buying than selling.   Going down is the opposite.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:13:18
it's just gonna go back up again.  it's what bitcoin has done for years.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:43:54
I get what you're saying but I think you'd have about the same chance of success when it comes to cryptocurrencies.  From what I've read stock brokers have about the same ROI as any average joe shmoe.  People want to act like they're being smart but face it, especially when it comes to cryptocurrencies.. it's a huge gamble.  Honestly the only thing that seems to matter are the psychological barriers based on the fact that we use base 10 as our number system... ie.. $20,000 is a big number for us humans because it's nice and round.  We've bounced off it twice already.  If we can get to $20,000.01 then we'll get to close to $25,000 in short order.  No reason other than that's a nice round number humans like to deal with.  Then we'll probably flutter up and down around that number till it's crossed and we continue on to the next psychological barrier... which I dunno.. every 5k might be big but the next real obstacle would be 50k I think.  As long as nothing horrible happens I don't see why we wouldn't continue along this path.  Even then... who knows.  China clamped down on bitcoin hard and the price went through the roof.  The media is making a huge deal about bitcoin right now and there are more people buying than ever.  Why wouldn't it just keep going up?

None of the new money cares about anything but bitcoin.  Branding is  everything.  The new money doesn't care if bitcoin is a currency, for them it's just an investment.  There's still plenty of new money coming.  The local NPR station has been talking about bitcoin for the last couple of weeks.  Institutional investment is just starting.  That said, my opinion is Bitcoin won't succeed as a currency unless two very important things happen... fees get a lot smaller AND buying things with bitcoin gets treated by the local government as using currency instead of selling an asset.

I follow a sound strategy of buying high, selling low and then buying when it goes back up again :/  Actually, I just buy $10 every week no matter what.  I got nervous this morning when I woke up to being down ~10% in 4 or 5 hours.  I sold my bitcoin, paid the got dang fees and then promptly regretted it.  
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:23:17
$3000.  Why?  no idea, I just wanted to get in on the guessing game :)

For many people the argument is the gross percentage of your taxes that goes to supporting the military industrial complex and killing people around the world.  So, there's that.  Not passing judgement either way.  Everyone make their own decisions and deal with the consequences.  Or not.  Whatever.

Got in at $800 and then for another $10 every week since then.  Just sold all my coins with the idea I'd buy back in when it's done tanking... so, y'all are welcome... because I assume now the 'crash' will stop.

Use a desiccant like Damprid, not rice.  It's super cheap, can be gotten at Walmart or a home improvement store like the Home Despot.

Wild harvested yaupon, the only caffeinated tea native to the U.S.   
@_date: 2015-11-04 18:07:52


Nice! that shows over 3000 businesses just in my area!
@_date: 2015-10-27 14:25:52
You working for East India Tea Co? ;) Plenty of modern studies show that yaupon contains no emetics, but I'll tell you a great conspiracy theory around that name. Native Americans made a ceremonial beverage that contained yaupon called Black Drink. They added different plants and nobody is sure as the the exact recipes but most versions of Black Drink contained yaupon. They would sometimes fast for days and then chug huge quantities of Black Drink until they purified themselves through ritual vomiting. 
Yaupon had become popular in North America and was being exported to many European countries under various names like  Chocolate del Indio in Spain, South Sea Tea in England, and Apalachine in France.  The person who gave yaupon its scientific name was William Aiton, the royal botanist to King George III. Some believe that Aiton name it Ilex vomitoria was because he was in the secret employ of the world’s first multinational corporation, the East India Company, which wanted to preserve its stranglehold over the world’s tea trade. 
I love a good story.
