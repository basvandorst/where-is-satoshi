Stocks are literal OWNERSHIP of a (hopefully) profitable or soon-to-be profitable company, even if other people wouldn’t pay one dollar for it. A house is still a LIVE-ABLE home base that could even be used to make more money via rent - even if other people wouldn’t pay one dollar for it. 
Bitcoins use-case is for transferring money overseas, tax evasion, sending large sums of money to friends/ family. Outside of those, 90+% of the money that’s “in” it today is because someone thinks that someone else will buy it for more later on. A bitcoin is still a bitcoin if it’s worth $0, but I’d rather own a company or a building that’s tangible. Also if a bitcoin is worth $0, mining stops and the network collapses as well. 
How often is bitcoin talked about for its usefulness. If anything lite coin or many other cryptos are a million times better because you can transfer more quickly and cheaply. Long-term mining also has to be solved. What happens when the btc supply is exhausted? Do tx fees go up exponentially depending on market demand at the time?

You can live in a house, you can’t live in a bitcoin. The number of stick figures I’ve drawn lifetime is finite too, that doesn’t mean they’re valuable.

Technically we can’t travel to many of them, even with future technology. That being said there “should” be plenty of planets in the Milky Way.

I'm new also, is the best strategy to never cash in for USD, and just keep the BTC for purchases as more people/ retailers accept it as payment?

Don't we need WAY more than 2MB block long-term anyway? Segwit isn't a long term solution is it?
