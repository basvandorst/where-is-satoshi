Thanks for the response.  I suppose if Bitcoin becomes more ubiquitous there will be more structure around passing it on to others too.  It just seems that, like a natural selection process, bitcoins are going to continue to get lost over time.  But I see your point about continuing to divide up existing ones.

I am also one who just joined in after years of off and on reading.  I still don't plan on HODL (I know I'll catch flak for that).  I'm going to hold until a point it's all gone or I can pay off all debt.

I'm not sure why I tend to see things like this in many different subreddits.  People love to complain about the content, a certain percentage of users who do xyz, noobs, too many memes, etc.  The thing is this: reddit already has a system in place for it.  It's the upvote downvote system (and moderation).  If you don't like how those things are done in a particular subreddit, maybe that subreddit is not for you.

Lol, I thought maybe he was being sarcastic, then I looked at his post history.  And yes, if he was one of the best crypto traders he'd have enough money to not be behind on rent.

Related question - what happens if someone holding bitcoins dies and they didn't leave behind a way for them to be transferred to someone?  What if no one even knows they had them?  Won't these bitcoins be lost forever?  If there is a finite amount to ever be released, will we slowly lose all bitcoins this way?
