Thanks! Also this charity has made me think (as i work with a great local charity) but i should probably make a  fresh post. As they dont accept bitcoin and as i work in the accounts dept am wondering what i'd need to do to 'set them up' to accept it. Cant hurt for a charity to have more options of receiving payments! Thanks again

What other ways are there to earn bitcoins? I vaguely understand the 'mining' aspect but i know i have no hardware that would even come close. Other than that the only other way i know, i assume would just be to buy some however i dont get paid till the 22nd this month. Are there other methods to get them. I have to say it's been great fun the past couple of days and really interesting. Wish had got involved sooner now!

This is a really good explanation. Thank you very much!
@_date: 2014-12-12 14:08:52
Cool, thanks very much. You guys are very helpfull over here!
@_date: 2014-12-11 13:55:12
Thanks very much! Looking forward to my donut hole later!

i feel like two subs have merged with this news and it's nice that its not a community of jerks!! Woo XbitcoinOne
@_date: 2014-12-11 22:15:03
I would have said the exact same thing had you not got here first. Have had one of the best days on reddit today between these two subs and one or two others have come across. Also, love this tipping thing you can do! Who knew!
@_date: 2014-12-12 12:47:08
I'm jealous! I live in the UK and is fairly limited on what/where can buy from at the moment using Bitcoin. However i think it will come in time. 
(as long as our retarded government manages to actually understand the internet at some point)
@_date: 2014-12-11 14:55:39
Fantastic, thanks for the response! Thats very helpfull. Yeah the security would be an issue for me going forwards, however I think have only got a couple of 'bits' (not sure if right word) at the moment so not much there for someone to steal at the moment but going forwards i imagine it would be much more important if i end up with enough bitcoins to actually try and buy something! Thanks again!
@_date: 2014-12-11 17:13:31
thanks! 
Edit: You sir/miss are a great person.
@_date: 2014-12-11 13:20:43
Thanks, that seemed to be what I was thinking. 
Yeah there is a tonne of stuff to look through and I just worry about the scammers being out there. Ususally they're easy to spot but looking into a new service type thing makes it a bit harder! I'll check out that greenaddress.it thing though so thanks!
@_date: 2014-12-12 12:53:20
This could be my evening made if i can rack up a few extra bits later on. The mrs would love it as well. Give her a reason to not moan at me for sitting on the internet lol!
I really should get on with some work though, i've been on reddit now for about 4 hours and no ones noticed......yet....lol
@_date: 2014-12-12 13:07:30
I agree (and have previously said) that it was a great day having and mixing it up yesterday. Kudos to for getting us up to speed!
@_date: 2014-12-16 18:39:32
Coming from too. Loving playing around with bitcoin. Was only down to you guys 'showing me the way' that i now get(ish) what i'm doing. Officially brought a pizza at the weekend using bitcoin (thanks to one of your users who also gave me loads of great info) and now i'm struggling to stop tipping people!
No idea what my favorite game is yet though. Just want Halo MCC to be fully fixed, so until then the redone GTA5 has it.
EDIT: Also, didn't even cross my mind that charities could accept them. Thanks for the heads up as theres some really deserving ones out there!
@_date: 2014-12-11 13:21:21
Thank you, yeah the 2fa i figure is fairly important! 
@_date: 2014-12-12 12:09:01
Thank you very much for the response. Really helping a bit of a novice out!
@_date: 2014-12-11 16:12:20
You guys here will likely get a bit of an influx of subscribers (myself included) following this news from r/xboxone and the 'tipping' has really made people look into it properly instead of dismissing it.
@_date: 2014-12-12 14:02:04
Yeah about that. If your sure will PM you in a moment? Will definitely return the favour but dont feel obligated to!
Your help has been invaluable, you are a credit to this sub! 
@_date: 2014-12-11 15:00:54
I came (and sub'ed) to r/bitcoin to say thanks for all your help and information for some of us less knowledgeable on bitcoin from over in r/xboxone....so Thanks!
@_date: 2014-12-12 11:00:22
I'm just going to go around the subs i'd usually visit (before yesterdays announcement, which brought me here among other places) and tip people randomly. It really kind of forces you to take a look into it (worked with me and probably a lot of people in and is quite a nice gesture even if can only afford pennies!
@_date: 2014-12-12 13:42:07
Thanks for the links/info, theres so much to read up on (which is perfect for my job to keep me out of trouble!) 
Cool, i think i'll be buying at the end of month then, would be good just to have a bit behind me like you say, and see where it goes/how it develops now have gotten a taste for it! 
Also, you seem very knowlegeable and are very helpfull on this subject so thank you very much!
@_date: 2014-12-12 12:08:30
Thank you very much. Just the reply i was after and cleared it up a bit more for me. Bread part made me hungry though but thanks!
@_date: 2014-12-12 13:13:58
Yeah i set one up yesterday. Thought if i'm going to get into this then to do it properly!
Unfortunately i'm having to use an online one for now (as i have a windows phone so no app) but think that will do for a begginer anyway. Has been really interesting (and quite a lot of fun) over the past couple of days as i read a lot about Bitcoin about 6+ months ago but then never went any further with it. Now have got a few 'bits' though it's quite fun and really eye opening!
@_date: 2014-12-11 13:45:48
ahh, im on a windows phone lol.
