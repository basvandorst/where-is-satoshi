My delay in time should not change anything.  I only decide to respond to trolls like you when i get bored.  
Given that I'm a little bored, tell me, did the Fed prevent people from losing money in Lehman brothers, or MF Global?  
Since you're concerned about my financial well being, you should know that Mt. Gox didn't hold any of my digital representations of federal reserve notes, nor any of my bitcoins, but thanks for asking.

"It was an argument in favour of central banking because central banks don't tend to disappear with a substantial fraction of all the currency that will ever exist."
That's interesting, what's the value of a dollar now, versus what it was back when the fed came into existence?  In other words, will one dollar buy you roughly the same now as what it would 100 years ago?  
If not, where did that money go?  
 "Central banking doesn't stop you losing money on a bad business decision, but it does give you the option of making the safest investments, with a guaranteed (but low) return, and the best possible protection of your money, including insurance."
You mean like MF global "safe investments"?   So because the fed exists, we have a stock market (all of which being safe investments)?  Is that what you're trying to say?

The real legal question is who is a 'taxpayer' and who is a'nontaxpayer'.  Whether bitcoin is 'money' or not, for the purpose of taxation, from an income tax standpoint, is only relevant to the former, at least in America.

Yeah, all MD's are working with patients who are in emergency medical situations.  It's not like they prescribe dangerous antipsychotics for mild depression ever, or dangerous statins for healthy lipid profiles ever.

Did a donkey kick you in the head for this reply?  
It's almost like you're trying to argue that the fed has kept every bank afloat.  Now, I know you're a fucking idiot, but seriously, just tell me that a donkey kicked you in the head and I'll understand how you fucked this one up so badly.   
@_date: 2014-04-15 21:27:14
You're assuming that all of those &gt;200,000 patients who die every year from conventional medical care are dying from emergency room incidents.  That is definitely NOT the case.  Many of these people are dying because they were foolish enough to listen to their doctor about taking something like zocor to lower cholesterol.  Further, that number is actually on the LOW side.  More detailed analysis, performed by PhD's and MD's, suggests that the number is closer to 1M per year.

If the government can find that you have something, they're going to take it.  If you think things are bad now, wait and see what they do when the next financial crisis occurs.
If you understand this and yet are promoting cryptocurrencies being more trackable to make government more friendly to their rollout, it should be apparent right now what a bad idea that is for the common man that is a producer in this world. 
@_date: 2014-05-11 22:09:56
They have a fascist system over there, but let me help you out, to help you get back on track.  Your original, idiotic argument, was that one bitcoin/bank failure, was somehow an argument in favor of central banking.  Wasn't it, fuck head?   
Since that time i've shown that:
1)  Central banking didn't save anybody, except a few oligarchs in the Soviet Union.
2)  Central banking didn't save anybody invested with Lehman Brothers or MF Global.  
So where does that leave your idiotic point.  Maybe you should try using a flashlight while you're checking for any other answers in your rectum, this time around.  
@_date: 2014-05-13 17:40:03
That's all fine, but every dollar in circulation is created at interest, and there is never enough currency in circulation to cover both principle and the interest, therefore you create a nation/world of debtors when the currency is created in this manner VIA private and for profit/above the law central banks, which is what we have with the federal reserve counterfeiting racket.  Everybody using the feds currency are using instruments of debt.  If you don't believe that the fed exists outside of the law, you should take that up with Alan Greenspan.  
Reality.  One. Oh. One.

It has actual definitions of the LEGAL terms as written in the internal revenue code.  It boils down to whether you are an 'employee', 'employer', etc, who earned 'wages' as defined in the IRC or not. Whether you lie or not is your own decision.  The book merely points out the actual letter of the law, enabling one to make an informed response, rather than simply being a sheep who assumes it applies to them because 'everybody else is paying it'.

You are so completely brainwashed.  Your argument is analogous to a black slave saying, "Without these chains we have on our ankles, we'd never be able to have food and shelter which our master provides for us."
It's worth noting that in 1984 an independent investigation put forward by what was called "The Grace Commission" found that:
“100% of what is collected is absorbed solely by interest on the Federal Debt … all individual income tax revenues are gone before one nickel is spent on the services taxpayers expect from government.” -Grace Commission report submitted to President Ronald Reagan – January 15, 1984
The income tax is one of the greatest scams ever perpetrated on the American people.  The IRS is in fact a private collection agency from Puerto Rico doing the collection for the privately owned federal reserve banking cartel.  That's your new slave master you lick the boots of.

I base that on looking at how parabolic moves tend to correct.  It was a massive run up, and it's all based on speculation of its potential future value, which may be immense.  That said, it's a speculative play, and it could easily get knocked way back down.  The little correction we just had was based largely on the seemingly negative China news.  I'm rooting for it, but I see it as being pretty fragile to a major correction for a while.  Then again, I expected it to correct back down to $18, after it ran to $25 and ended up watching it float away from me as i got greedy.

2.      If not an organization within the U.S. Department of the Treasury, then what exactly is the IRS?
Answer:  The IRS appears to be a collection agency working for foreign banks and operating out of Puerto Rico under color of the Federal Alcohol Administration (“FAA”).  But the FAA was promptly declared unconstitutional inside the 50 States by the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of U.S. v. Constantine, 296 U.S. 287 (1935), because Prohibition had already been repealed.
