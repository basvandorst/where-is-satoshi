Bitmain is the criminal group. Their CEO Jihan Wu is a suspect murder killed his partner FIredcat years ago. The Chinese police is still investigating this case. BCH is a fraud

 'Satoshi was a covert government agency', I had the same thought. I somehow wish it was true, then 1 million $ per bitcoin will be soon achieved with the help of govts/ruling elites. Decentralization? nah I don't really care lol

@_date: 2018-06-04 13:20:51
you're so naive, look at those top exchanges, most of them are Chinese. Chinese are the dominant power in cryptos

In order to ban it again, you need to unban it first
@_date: 2019-10-28 21:25:33
Then why did you bother watching?
@_date: 2019-06-01 11:18:56
Is this news source reliable? I don't see this report from other crypto news.
@_date: 2019-02-17 18:34:16
Think this way, the economists who proposed this dual currencies system may hold bitcoins. And this is their way to destroy the current banking system

Any guide on how to access the bitcoin network from satellite?
@_date: 2018-02-20 23:27:25
the next step of adopting segwit is to implement LN, we gonna see LN on every exchanges in a few years and avg ppl can buy bits or even satoshis from them. That's when mass adoption starts
@_date: 2019-01-25 09:05:40

He and his dinosaur friend warren buffet belongs to last century. Why the next generation need to give a fuck about their opinion? look what MS has done to Netscape, they are NOT able to do this shit again to cryptos. They know their monopoly game is going to the end. PS windows are dying, they can't make any progress after windows 10 LoL

I highly suspect that these USDTs are just created outta nowhere. Tether might be just a fraud created by exchanges
@_date: 2017-10-29 10:19:09
As long as it's POW, miners can do whatever they want in their favor coz they have a warehouse of computers.

This douchebag raised one question for us. What if the government crack down non fiat cryptos on global scales one day when they feel threatened by bitcion. What can we do about it? How can we prepare now? 
@_date: 2017-10-19 08:07:37
So China is playing the good guy supports bitcion
@_date: 2017-10-30 11:14:59
In order to ban bitcion again, you need to unban it first
