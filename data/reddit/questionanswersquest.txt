the housing bubble of 2007 was just that, a bubble.  bitcoin is home of the bubble.  mortgages and banks are still necessary and do good.

hey, now that i think of it you're right. providing low-interest loans and liquidity to the housing market must be some sort of scam.

probability is a better way to calculate risk than tinfoil.  


inflation of 3% a year can be mitigated with risk free bonds.  the stock market is less volatile than bitcoin and has returned an annualized 6 percent a year.  bitcoin lost 80 percent of its value in 2014. 


what are the odds of a cyprus situation happening in the united states?  measure that against the likelihood of further bitcoin depreciation. 


you are fdic insured against counter-party risk.  identity theft protection is the cost of doing business and is covered by most banks. 


i have a chase account and everything except wire transfers are free.  those are 25 bucks, but i can just as easily use venmo or paypal for smaller transfers.
