You can't know for sure, but you also can't know for sure that your country won't shut down and take all your fiat with it.

It seems like this substantial initial buy-in would make it easy for miners to justify a modest subscription fee on analytics. I don't imagine the people forking out $5k on equipment would think twice about spending 1-2 btc/month to protect that investment.

A big step from, but also in, Alpaca socks.

I like it when my currency mirrors my general outlook on life.

But those sites that do accept Bitcoin save around 5% transaction fee on each purchase that would be skimmed by the credit card company. I wouldn't be so sure that this won't incentivize sites to accept bitcoin, and possible even cut  btc purchasers a deal to encourage it. So you may save money by using btc.

Last time I checked there were several entrepreneurs that would order stuff off amazon/newegg/etc. for you for a small cut of your coins. Unless these people get shut down extremely quickly every time they start an operation like this, there's not much that bitcoins can't buy. 
Sooo, there's another limitation that doesn't exist.

The Meshnet partnership sounds interesting.

This might be a good candidate for cross-posting to other subreddits, since the crowd seems to agree it is one of the first fair and accurate representations.

I don't think "volatile asset" is really fair. While volatility technically just means dispersion of an asset's value and not whether the dispersion is positive or negative, the risks associated with volatility are largely associated with dispersion in both directions (a wobbling price). With bitcoin, we are disincentivized from spending, but not because dispersion makes it hard to value. It is the perceived predictable rise in value of btc that makes us want to hang on to them and impairs btc commerce at the moment.
Would anyone call Google stock up to '07 a volatile asset? Then we shouldn't use that term for btc either.
