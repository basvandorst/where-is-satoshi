You don't need to worry. If you wanted to buy Bitcoin(BTC), then "Bitcoin core" is just how that particular website refers to it.
"Bitcoin core" is what the slightly over-enthusiastic Bitcoin-Cash supporters call Bitcoin (as seen on bitcoin.com).
"BCash" is what the slightly over-enthusiastic Bitcoin supporters call Bitcoin-Cash (as seen in this thread).
Both are just silly attempts to de-legitimise the other currency.

The concerns expressed in that thread are valid ones. The current slow transaction times and expensive fees are undeniable. Bitcoin gets its value from the assumption that it will become an accepted transactional currency in the future. If you cannot transact with Bitcoin, then you will see its value slowly start to fade.
The more important question that you must ask yourself is if you are confident that Bitcoin can solve these transaction problems soon. Segwit is here and Lightning Network are coming soon, so hopefully that will solve these problems. 
If no solution is found then Bitcoin will die, as will any other currency that cannot guarantee high transaction speed and low transaction fees even at high volumes.

The direct tax rate in India is *very* fair.  By the time you hit the 20% bracket, you will be considered rich relative to the country average.
@_date: 2017-08-03 13:38:37


The 20% tax bracket is applicable to the financially secure. The poorer sections have 0% tax or 10%. By the time they hit the 20%  bracket they are financially secure.


The average citizen is typically killed on the indirect taxes, but it is unfair for us Indians to expect bitcoin to help in this regard.


The tax rules are well laid out, and the tax authorities are smart. If you pay your taxes you can't be harassed.


This is 100% correct. I would wager that less than 1% of real estate transactions report the actual amount. But here I blame the citizens and not the government. The government is corrupt as hell, but the non-payment of taxes by most people is due to their own dishonesty and not because of any systemic failure.
@_date: 2017-08-03 16:31:33


My point is that Bitcoin *can't* sidestep this taxation. That's the nature of indirect taxation.


But what happens when the buyer is also complicit in this tax evasion, as is the case most of the time in India?


Not really. I'm Indian and this is the prevalent mindset.


I literally stated in my earlier reply that "The government is corrupt as hell"
Anyway, don't take my word for it. I'm sure if you do your own research you'll find that the picture is a lot more complicated that people not following the law because the law is not respectable.

The problem is not with the toilets, but the fact that a large portion of the country doesn't have access to electricity and running water. The lack of toilets is the end result of these inadequacies.
As for why there is no running water or electricity, it's because of corruption all through the system that swallows funds earmarked for these facilities.

His point was fair. Bitcoin cannot become mainstream with high transaction costs. He doesn't need to have a solution for voicing that opinion. It doesn't matter if you are tired of hearing it. Of course there are other forks, but the question asked by OP was about what it would take for *Bitcoin* to be considered mainstream, not the forks.
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:30:26
Out of curiosity, what use cases *do* you envision for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-03 14:23:30
Wow. This is without doubt the most polite conversation I have ever managed to have on the internet. You have a good day :)
@_date: 2017-08-23 14:22:20
That makes sense from a technical perspective, but the question isn't "why is my 9$ transaction with a 50¢ fee not going through?". The question is "How can this be an acceptable situation where even a 50¢ fee on a 9$ transaction is insufficient for it to be confirmed?"

Edit: I don't mean this to sound rude, but you're commenting about a system you don't know about. So far I've had to explain tax brackets because you incorrectly assumed high taxation rates. I've had to explain indirect taxes. You don't seem to realise that circumventing indirect taxes will increase the pressure on direct taxes. 
For Bitcoin to succeed, we'll need higher level of thought than "make laws respectable" and "send agents over". Without understanding a system why do we assume that Bitcoin is a solution for everything?
Edit 2: non payment of tax will lead either to higher tax rates, or to less work being done. I think the idea that non-payment of tax is some sort of conscientious protest is rooted in bad economic thought.
That sounded rude but I didn't mean it that way. You have a good day :)

Thanks for taking the time to explain. I don't agree with your reasoning, but I thank you for taking the time to explain nevertheless.

My disagreement comes more from the understanding of the system in work here in India. 
The first disagreement is more with the original comment's rather than with yours. I think the whole "pulling out of poverty" logic is very hyperbolic. I would think that the politicians in India would welcome bitcoin if their interest was in self-enrichment. Right now it is known that Indian politicians are huge patrons of swiss banks. That's why I find answers like the "pulling out of poverty" lazy rationalizations, because politicians would LOVE bitcoin as it makes their illegal holdings easy. Bribery would become super easy ( though I do not advocate banning bitcoin for this reason)
Secondly, here the holding of fiat isn't that heavy. The banking system here is GREAT. Most people still prefer to invest in gold. Bitcoin's store of value properties will not be that much more advantageous as compared to gold once its price stabilizes.
Thirdly, and once again not connected with your comment, I think Bitcoin is not really expanding the right way. Instead of focusing on making transactions easier/safer/faster/cheaper/ubiquitous, I'm seeing bitcoin worrying more about its market cap instead of increasing its usage in third-world countries like India. Without the utility, I'm not a subscriber to the whole store-of-value idea behind Bitcoin.
None of my comment is intended to come of as rude or condescending. It's just that based on my experience of the conditions here in India, I am less optimistic about the possible benefits of Bitcoin here.

Can someone explain how Bitcoin will pull people out of poverty? I see this line of thinking being used frequently, but I can't understand it.
@_date: 2017-08-03 18:31:33
You certainly did not come off as a pretentious outsider. You have been most respectful in discussing my opposing views and I am thankful for that :)
We're in agreement that the government is corrupt. I assure you the people are corrupt too.
My point is that while I agree that the system should be cleaned up, I can also *understand* why the government might not permit Bitcoin because it can be a tool for laundering money.

Very informative comment. Thanks
@_date: 2018-04-24 16:33:00
OP, do ***you*** have any arguments against this assertion that Bitcoin is ruining the environment?
If you do then let's add them to this thread.
If you don't then how do you know that the assertions that Bitcoin is bad for the environment are untrue and therefore need to be refuted?

RBI talks about a digital currency.. not cryptocurrency.
The RBI circular is a blanket circular for cryptocurrencies, so JioCoin will not be allowed either.

There really isn't a reason. The internet is just a perfect medium to express hatred/anger without repercussions. There was a time when the BTC community hated LTC too.
@_date: 2018-04-25 18:32:46
Ah, my mistake. I thought you meant bitcoin was a more efficient technology.

Unfortunately in India, loan scams can only be pulled by the ultra rich and/or powerful. Regular folks won't be given a home loan without adequate collateral.
