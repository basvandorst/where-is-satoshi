FWIW, there were 3 people in line ahead of me on Haloween night. Seemed to be quite busy then.

I just did this too.
My experience:
Walked in with one guy using the machine. I lined up behind him and had to wait a few minutes to use it. I brought $1000 cash with me.
Started using it, had to do the palm scan 5-6 times like you said and enter my email. Then had to wait about 10 minutes for my account to be created. Walking in I honestly had no idea this would happen. Wish there was a sign or something just to let you know. It was quite vague how long it would take. Didn't know if it would be 30 seconds or 24 hours. Do I grab a hot chocolate or come back tomorrow? I went with the hot chocolate, had a seat, and got an email 10 minutes later saying my account was ready. 
By that time there were 3 people in line behind the guy using the machine, so it definitely seems to have some traffic. One was also a reporter.
Once I got to use the machine, I tried scanning a paper QR code from an Armory wallet I created in advance. It scanned, but wouldn't accept it. I honestly don't know if I had the right type of QR code with me, something I still need to learn I guess. So I was able to fairly easily deposit my $1000 and print out a new QR code.
Just got home and learned all about sweeping that into another wallet.
Overall, it wasn't really difficult, but I can see how the current process, even using a 'simple' ATM would be way too difficult for many people.
Also right as I was leaving the owner came in to help someone there that apparently had some issues with the ATM. So seems like the support for it is pretty good right now at least.
Hopefully soon the process on how to deposit into the ATM, transfer to a secure wallet, and then easily transfer to a mobile wallet or something for spending will be a simple clear process.
Edit: I should add, it only took about 20-30 minutes for the bitcoins to end up in my wallet.

The biggest usability issues IMO weren't with the UI on the screen (although it could use some work), but with the physical elements.
I don't recall a label on the machine for the palm scanner, QR scanner, place to insert cash, etc...
You just kind of had to look around and figure what was what.

As a country, yes. Our banks are just as evil as the rest of the world though.

Like it. But needs to revolve around Randy. 
Randy gets nosy while Stan is on his computer. Randy investigates, gets obsessed, stares at charts all day in his underwear and stop showering.
That's all I got...

Yup, that's what I did. Feel like an idiot now, and have moved the coins into another wallet just in case the ATM caches that error or something.
This also shows how the process to buy/manage bitcoins still isn't the best. I'm not a stupid person, but that was a stupid mistake. I can only imagine the types of things that would happen to someone less technical (eg. giving away their entire wallet thinking its an address like I did).

IMO this is because Litecoin is going crazy right now, and BTC-e is one of the easier places to turn BTC into LTC. Many people on that exchange are swapping their BTC for LTC (or a portion of it), causing extra BTC sells.
@_date: 2013-11-02 00:52:06
Agree with most of your points. But I don't think the ATM knows what the exchange rate is until it knows how much you want to buy. 
If its just an exchange and there is only 1 BTC available at the price of $210, but 10 BTC available for $220, it doesn't know what the exchange rate will be until it knows the quantity you wish to purchase.

Well this convinced me. Just finished setting up my first paper wallet.
