Yep the dust threshold is 54.3 micro btc. Hence I said tip 500 micro btc. I have seen people give 7000 doge tips. and I have received 500 doge tips myself. The only reason I even mentioned this was because of the scathing hatred I see here. But, I also see many reasonable comments.

What you're saying is absolutely correct. Dogecoin wouldn't even be there today, had Bitcoin not paved the way first. But just like you said, that there are good eggs, and bad eggs, the same is true with Dogecoiners as well. I hope we continue to grow as much as you have, and with as much fortitude. 
+100 doge verify (this is our custom for appreciating something, so please do not feel disgusted or mortified.)

Well, start with a 50microBTC tips then! But, would you?

This is why Bitcoin community is full of curmudgeonly people who do not care about either community, or others, but only their own profits.
Everyone knows about Bitcoins, but anyone can get Dogecoins. Even as tips. Let me ask - how many of you would care tipping me bitcoins, even just 500 microBTC? No one! We as a community care!
Now, true fact that if Bitcoin and Litecoin hadn't been around, Dogecoin would not even exist - but we don't go about making crass comments about others do we? For you, good sir, I will tip some,to get you started!
+10 doge Have a good day.
