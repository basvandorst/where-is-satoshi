Everything you've mentioned happened after the period of "stability" started, so I doubt any of those directly caused it.

While Bitshares/protoshares are designed to give the holders an investment in Invictus Innovation's future products, they were/are 100% fairly mined.  Angleshares, I think it's called, are their version of an IPO, and only started a few months after protoshares mining started.

I think he means Ripple doesn't have a ~10 minute block time, but instead new transactions are added to their ledger instantly (Is this the case?).  With Bitcoin new transactions only get added to the ledger when a miner finds a new block and adds those transactions to it.
He is factually incorrect in stating that Bitcoin network nodes do not contain the full ledger.  If they are using the official Bitcoin client, they will have the ledger (which is why it takes up nearly 20 gigabytes of hard-drive space at this point).

This hypothetical locker would have an internet connected "time lock" that unlocks when it sees the transaction on the network, and that it has the required number of confirmations, I presume.  The harder part imo would be verifying the person put the correct amount of cash in it.  It would potentially need to be a full Bitcoin ATM, implying local trades wouldn't be worth implementing in it.

I think it's obvious from the announcement that they have been running on fractional reserves, otherwise they wouldn't be in this predicament due to large withdrawals.
I'm just curious if they announced at the time of their funds being stolen that they didn't have enough funds to cover all deposits, but I doubt it, since that would have resulted in a bank run.
@_date: 2014-04-18 23:33:11
Yea of course it doesn't.  If there were such an exploit I doubt that much hash power could have been used to take advantage of it without the pool noticing immediately.  The answer is probably that one (or more) of the ASIC manufacturers has ratcheted up production, and is "warming in" their new chips before shipping.

OF course, but you have to know where to look.  That's why someone started a thread on following where various people's Gox deposits have gone.  All you need to start is a deposit address given to you by Gox to send your BTC to.

The funny thing is they did EXACTLY this when they added LTC mining with an out-of-pocket bonus reward, since huge pools were proxying to them to steal from their own miners.

I completely agree.  I think libertarians are some of the first people to discover and be involved with Bitcoin, and they've hung on to it ever since.  The people I've introduced it to, however, are more interested in the near-instant ability to send money over large distances without needing to pay substantial fees.  And the joys of mining.

I haven't yet tried using a mobile wallet.  Is Mycelium superior to the official wallet (if there is such a thing)?  Is there any trust involved (do they have access to my private keys)?
@_date: 2014-03-08 19:14:16
This isn't conclusive proof.  Especially since the Mt. Gox method to do this exact processing was (apparently) leaked a week ago.  If someone else gained control of Mt. Gox's supposed private keys, they could have easily executed these transactions.

He means it in the sense of pseudo-science hypnosis, where you supposedly store in your memory things that you don't have access to, perhaps to the extent of every combination of numbers and letter you've ever seen, though realistically I don't think this is very feasible.
But for the $600mil they could be worth, I think it would be a good idea for the real Nakamoto to be hypnotized to see if he can recall his key, assuming it was lost and he's not purposely saving his stash.

Coinbase lets you send off-the-blockchain Bitcoins to another Coinbase user's account via their e-mail address.  It would be cool if there were some way to associate addresses in your wallet with your e-mail address, and people could just send directly through the blockchain to your e-mail address.

Two things:
1) That site is riddled with inaccuracies (
2) Since that page was published, Ripple has become fully open source (
Nevertheless, since Ripple could be massively devalued at any time by Ripple dumping millions more onto the market, I haven't bought any.  Also, they've had multiple giveaways I've tried to enter but haven't received any ripples from (e.g.,the bitcointalk one, the github linking one).

Transactions already slow to a crawl during heavy trading activity.  By putting micropayments on the blockchain, it will cause significant bloat, and potentially slow down all payments significantly.
I think what we need is some kind of off-the-blockchain micropayment service where a user can deposit a few millibitcoins, and that service would let them tip or pay miniscule amounts for content or access to things.  Of course right now this would require trust, but it's a much better idea than thousands of people sending a few Satoshis to wsj 3x a day to get past a paywall.

Credit card fraud is rampant, and the banks eat the charges.  In general, it's not worth their time to report the thefts to the police, even when they know exactly who used the stolen credit cards (e.g., you illegally use someone's credit card to pay your electricity bill).

Two math professors were eating at a restaurant, and one of them goes to the bathroom.  The other one calls over the waitress, and tells her "when I ask you a question, answer x^2 ."  The waitress says "okay", and walks away.  The other professor comes back from the bathroom and says, "as I was saying, most people these days don't know any math."  The first professor says "oh yeah? Let's test that hypothesis."  He calls over the waitress, and says to her "Excuse me miss, this may sound weird, but do you know what the integral of 2x is?"  The waitress immediately replies "of course, x^2 + c"

I'm sorry but your first paragraph doesn't make any sense to me.  Why would a company want all of their employees to have a copy of all of the company's data?  And why would the employees want to use their hard drive space to store it?  If it's about knowing the order things were made in, couldn't they simply use a versioning system?

In the case of SR, they just confiscated all the BTC and sent it to a publicly known address.  I couldn't see them messing around with Mt. Gox's systems, unless they wanted people to think it was MK moving the coins around for some reason.
If anyone still believes the "gag order" theory, it could be MK attempting to show that he still has access to at least this much BTC, but isn't allowed to spend it for whatever reason.
@_date: 2014-04-06 01:11:30
Not exactly.  While the other answers are technically correct, The hashrate is really only an indication of how efficiently the network is mining, not how distributed it is.  However, as the capabilities of new generations of ASIC miners level out, it would be a lot more costly for an attacker to perform a 51% attack, then if they could have obtained current generation ASIC tech when people were still mining on GPUs, and completely demolished any competition for blocks (i.e., a wealthy enough multinational bank could have teamed up with IBM or something, but at this point it may be cost prohibitive to do that.)  But this still illustrates the importance of not letting one ASIC manufacturer produce &gt;50% of the hardware for the network.

And they seriously don't have another image of the CEO other than that one photo that's used by many to represent the arrogance and lack-of-communication of Mt. Gox?

I completely agree.  NYT had an oped piece recently about why Bitcoin isn't a huge innovation, and all it talked about was how there's no advantage to use it to buy things online when you can just use a credit card or paypal.  
It would have been nice if they had addressed any of the other points you mentioned, but you hardly even see most Bitcoiners talking about those points.

Most of the posts here suggest that the manufacturers basically take your money, build themselves a miner, run it until it is no longer expected to earn more than what they are selling it for relative to the cost of electricity, then ship it to you.
The actual situation at this point has deteriorated further.  Just look at the current largest manufacturer's bitcointalk thread.  KNC took MILLIONS of dollars in preorder money for their nebulous "Neptune".  Instead of designing this money printer, they went ahead and spent those millions on a gigantic mining facility in Sweden where they are setting up their current gen miners en masse to mine for them.  Once they have substantially increased the difficulty (which they are clearly in the process of doing, just look at the network hashrate increases over the past few months while no large volume manufacturer has been shipping), they are offering the people who funded their whole operation the option of cancelling their orders for the Neptune miner, and instead getting hashing from their worn out facility for some fraction of time.
Since their facility will have ultra-cheap electricity and will run at a low temperature due to the ambient environment, even if they were fair to their customers and shipped their products, it would be impossible to compete with them on a hashs/$/killowatt basis.
tl;dr Greedy ASIC manufacturer KNC is well on the way to destroying the "decentralized" Bitcoin experiment.
