My knowledge is extremely limited, but if the 51% happens and the perpetrators were gambling on bitcoin failing (shorting?), wouldn't that be more profitable AND fuck the network? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:43:23
great, thanks. I'll try the mobile version :-)

BTC was being discussed on the biggest radio station in the UK this morning... I suspect it's had an impact

I know this is r/bitcoin but I figured I'd leave this bit of info here:
I used the Segwit option for my LTC wallet, and I couldn't move any LTC from coinbase...
After some digging, I changed the ledger option to Legacy and was able to move the funds no problem.
Hope this helps someone out

If one of those big addresses decided to cash out for fiat, could it drop the price so much that people lose faith in crypto and it cripples us?

Might wanna check formatting
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:13:33
I read that as SHARTED
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:56:02
What about other features of cryptocurrencies - like the anonymity aspect or the ease of moving wealth across borders - don't these add massive value? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 10:21:50
Here you go!

obviously we're in r/bitcoin so opinion is skewed, but it seems ETH is far quicker per transaction than BTC, and from my limited reading it seems many organisations are looking at ETH for their backend transactions.... I'm not sure why the price is stagnant at the mo. I read somewhere that it may be that the traders are keeping it artificially low for the moment....

Hypothetical question: What happens when it hits the mainstream and billions of people are using it, what's stopping there being a billion units, say a deciSatoshi or whatever we call it?
