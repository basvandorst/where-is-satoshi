A simple thought experiment will show you that this is simply a consequent of charging interest over debt. 
Imagine the total amount of gold available on earth is 100 Kg and it is distributed among the population of earth. Now imagine that because everyone believes they can earn more gold by lending it out and charging interest, everybody decides to lend out all the gold they have at an interest rate of 5% per year. So the total amount borrowed and lent by the entire population is 100 Kg at t=0. 
So after fifteen years, at t=15, the total amount owed must be 100 Kg * 1.05^(15) = 207.9 Kg . 
Even if everybody decides to pay back their loan, the total amount owed would still be 107.9 Kg, which is more gold then there is available on planet earth....

A hash is an output of a hash function. They have many applications in computer science. In this context specifically, they serve as a unit to indicate computational work, as in, actual energy spent. The amount of energy spent per unit time is a very important indicator for the security of a cryptocurrency, because it is a direct measure of how hard it is to double-spend a coin and a direct measure of how immutable the blockchain is.

PoW is about reaching consensus, not about verifying transactions.


If you double-spend a coin by creating Transaction A and Transaction B, then only 1 of these should enter the ledger, because adding them both would essentially mean you've double-spent the coin. However, there's no way of knowing which of these transactions should be invalidated because they're both valid. Some miners will include Transaction A and consider Transaction B invalid, while others will include Transaction B and consider Transaction A invalid. Without PoW, how are you going to reach consensus on which block is should be the one to follow?
@_date: 2019-02-03 14:44:20


To answer this question, we first need to properly define what we mean by "secure", usually it's something along these lines:
*In the bitcoin network we consider the blockchain to be properly secured if it is infeasible for an attacker to "rewrite" the blockchain, because rewriting the blockchain essentially means that somebody is being able to double-spend coins.*
(Note that being able to double-spend coins greatly undermines the value proposition of bitcoin being digital gold! Also think about what it actually means to rewrite a database that is distributed among thousands of hard disks.)
So how does Proof-of-Work then help us in securing the blockchain? (i.e. making it infeasible to rewrite the last x blocks.)
Well to "rewrite the blockchain", you have to create a chain of blocks that verifiably has more work done cumulatively speaking. Why? Because this is the only way to convince everybody in the network that the chain of blocks you have created is the one they should follow as well. And the reason it's convincing, is because it wasn't cheap to create such a chain, i.e. Proof-of-Works demonstrate that you we're willing to put some skin in the game. (This is why Proof-of-Work is also Proof-of-Stake, but the converse isn't true.)
So now that you know why we have Proof-of-Work and know that having more miners means that rewriting the blockchain is more expensive.
How would you answer your question?

So because changing the balances is very costly, you come to an agreement with the other person to keep track of your balances in a separate way by simply exchanging IOU's. This way you only need to change the balances on that piece of paper every so often by summing up who owes what based on the IOU's.

* You don't need an identity to send Bitcoin over the internet.
* Bitcoin's monetary policy is predictable.
* Bitcoin has a low inflation rate and will ultimately be deflationary.
* Bitcoin is permissionless, nobody can stop you from using it, nor can they tell you what you can or can't buy with it.
* It is difficult to perform mass financial surveillance on the Bitcoin network.

You'd be much surprised at how many people that have a degree in computer science do not understand how and why the bitcoin protocol works. Critical thinking will get you a lot farther is what I have noticed. Keep questioning the answers that are given to you. 


Let's think about this for a minute. It it were really so that it would require a majority of nodes to agree on each block, would you consider this good protocol design? Is it your expectation that each time a block is presented to the network that a majority of the nodes express agreement? Have you taken into consideration that nodes are very cheap to run? Also, what's going to stop me from adding the latest block to the tip of my chain if the majority of the nodes don't agree with that? Is it even possible to know at any given point in time how many nodes constitute a majority? Keep in mind that nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will.


How do you discern honest miners from dishonest miners? In any case, we can always verify ourselves if a block contains invalid transactions. It takes a few seconds to verify a block. It's only the finding of a Proof-of-Work which is hard. So basically: hard to solve, but easy to verify.

This is really sloppy language. 
To own bitcoin, you need to be in possession of the *private keys* that correspond to addresses that have a positive balance. The collection of private keys (which are used to sign transactions) is often managed by programs which are referred to as "wallets". Which is really unfortunate, because they really should've called them keychain managers or something like that. 
Clearly, wallets can't be on the blockchain. Also private keys are obviously NOT stored on the blockchain either, because the whole point is to keep them private.

**The protocol does not specify what should happen.** This is why you're getting a lot of mixed info. People who say with certainty what will happen if you don't include fees do not understand the mechanics of the system. 
You should think of the fee as a bounty for miners to include your TX in a block. The system is set up to be completely voluntary for all parties. This means that you're free to set it as low as you wish and miners are free to not include your TX if they think the fee is too low. 
Miners have different policies on what their mempool size may be, or how old the tx's in the mempool may be. Who knows, there may be miners that are willing to include your 0 fee tx. The reason we can call bitcoin an uncensorable transaction network is because nobody gets to decide for the entire network what does or does not go into the blockchain.

In the end it's all just unspent outputs with a bitcoin address and an amount of satoshi associated with it. 
Each bitcoin transaction consists of *inputs* and *outputs*. You can think of the inputs as "where the coins come from", and think of the outputs as *where the coins are going to". In reality, the inputs are just a list of pointers to unspent outputs, better known as Unspent Transaction Outputs or UTXO's.

So let's see, during the [Gold Standard]( 1 USD used to be worth 1.5 grams of gold, or equivalently 1 gram of gold used to be: 1 / 1.5 = 0.66 USD.
Today, the spot price of one Troy Ounce (31.10 grams) of gold is: 1275 USD. So the price of gold per gram is 1270 / 31.10 = 40.8 USD.
0.66 USD / 40.8 USD = 0.016.  So that means you can buy 98.4% less gold for the same dollar.

No thank you. I'd rather stick to scarce and hard currency. If you don't see the difference between salt and gold, then I don't expect you to see the difference between the USD and gold either. Salt was easy money, gold never was.

That's right, but its inflation decreases every 4 years, a minor detail you left out. 
In most currencies the inflation is either fixed or increasing.

Although it's only partially correct depending on what part of the Pubkey to Bitcoin Address we are talking about.
From Pubkey to Bitcoin Address it's:
    Pubkey -&gt;  HASH160 -&gt; Base58Check -&gt; Bitcoin Address.
Only the Base58Check part does checksumming.

Unfortunately, no I don't know any! In practice I would never broadcast a zero-fee transaction, nor would I recommend anybody broadcasting one. OP however, was asking what would happen in theory.

It only needs to be marginally profitable. It's really more like a lottery, than it is a sustainable profit model. 
No incentive -&gt; no miners -&gt; difficulty drops -&gt; people with bitcoin start mining -&gt; transactions get mined -&gt; problem solved.

Fractional reserve banking doesn't work any different in the case of bitcoin. It's quite simple really.
1) You deposit 10k BTC into your bank.
2) Out of that 10k BTC, the bank lends out 9k to someone else. This means that the bank now only has a fraction of what they owe you in reserve. 
Don't ask me what happens if you wish to withdraw that 10k BTC though.

Two years ago a chocolate bar cost about 3 mBTC while today it cost about 0.27 mBTC. I guess this means bitcoins deflation was whopping 1100% !!

You don't need a Trezor to recover your bitcoin. The whole idea behind HD (Hierarchical Deterministic) wallets is that all the keys can be generated deterministically from the master seed. You might want to have a look at BIP32 and BIP39:

A blockchain is just a data structure, namely a chain of blocks. Satoshi Nakamoto's Proof-of-Work consensus protocol is what allows certain blockchains to be decentralized, immutable and censorship resistant.
