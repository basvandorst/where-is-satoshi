Why say that after you comment? It's like you were trying to get the last word in or something.  You could easily have not typed any of that since you did not want further discussion.  
@_date: 2014-09-01 20:39:37
Considering this question could be answered with a very VERY simple google search you would come to realize no they do not.  Why not?  How are we supposed to know, go do some actual research instead of coming on here and asking if a company accepts bitcoin and why not if they don't.  I don't imagine its that easy for a company as big as uber to add bitcoin to their payments considering they need a way to make sure it works flawlessly before they can add it to their system.

I know you're just a buttcoin troll, so ill just say this.  No one could give the slightest fuck on what you think.  You are just like any other person in this world and act just as many others do.  Sound like an idiot and you shall be treated as one, next time try to actually formulate an argument that isnt at the same level as a 3rd grade "yo momma" joke.  Then Ill give you a few minutes of my day to actually discuss.  Thanks :)
@_date: 2014-09-20 03:29:34
Ill be the one laughing.  All these great buy opportunities are hilarious, people always say its a great buy when it drops and it just keeps dropping more.  
RemindMe! 1 year "lol this guy"
@_date: 2014-09-20 04:29:13
No I do not, Bitcoin does as it pleases.  It's like an independent black woman who don't need no man. I can't bet on that. ;)
@_date: 2014-09-20 05:03:36
Actually no, you just seem to be a little hot headed. If I was a troll I would be much worse.  I'm not making a bet with some stranger on the internet about Bitcoin.  I was trying to add humor but it seems like you don't really have a sense of humor.  I'll be on my way since I don't even know you and honestly don't care to get to know you.  Thanks for your comment though, gave me a good chuckle
@_date: 2014-09-03 03:12:16
Who in their right mind would go full bitcoin?  I made a ton of profit off of selling and buying it, but when its not adopted as universally as the USD why in the fuck would you ever think bitcoin could replace our modern currency.  Its takes time for people to adopt the idea and slowly change, you wont see the whole world move to bitcoin in one day.  It takes time, now that bitcoin is still catching on no one will be holding 100% bitcoin, they will buy it and use it for its great features and because they want to support it.  The reason its not as viable as the USD is because its not as mainstream.  You honestly have no clue what in gods name youre talking about and its just great to listen.  Thanks for taking a few days to reply, I can really see you put in some hard work into that thought process.  Youre making statements that people who have no clue how bitcoin works also make.  I hear this type of shit weekly and its hilarious because you cant even grasp the concept of what bitcoin is in the first place.  Again, don't come here trying to convince me with a petty argument that has no facts or even any value to it.  
@_date: 2014-09-01 20:43:04
Or if you arent stupid you would just use the bitcoin you already own to pay for it.  Your rational makes absolutely no sense, why would you buy bitcoin just to buy one item with bitcoin.  Its not like you go to buy a sliver of gold to purchase your groceries, you would buy more than you need and consider it as an asset and use it for future purchases.  No one is saying you need to buy bitcoin to purchase things, its just there for those who already have bitcoin and would like to spend it.  
@_date: 2014-09-20 05:09:09
You're the one mocking him for not buying at this price. Next time watch what you say and maybe others will follow.  You're setting a bad example for the politeness you are trying to get from me.  
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:24:45
its coinbase dude, its pretty much the only way to buy that much bitcoin in the US and why no one wants to buy bitcoins since its so damn difficult initially.  
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:25:59
thats a big gamble though
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:48:54
Im not saying he shouldnt have done it, just stating its a gamble I personally would not take.  youre right its his money so he can invest as he pleases!  Doesnt hurt to take risks every once and a while.
@_date: 2013-08-03 08:15:41
wow you are one very pessimistic man arent you.  Well keep your little conspiracy theories to yourself please and leave the rest of us alone
@_date: 2013-08-29 06:46:39
Well, it took me two weeks before I got any help so maybe wait a bit.
@_date: 2013-12-25 02:37:10
no because that would be the biggest joke of a gift ever to anyone I know.  Everyone would just forget about it or throw it away
@_date: 2013-08-02 18:02:16
Well...... What exactly is a paper wallet? 
@_date: 2013-08-02 17:46:30
Ill head over there now and check out some discussions 
@_date: 2013-08-02 17:23:17
I was always concerned with a web based, the website always warns that if the site goes down so does all of your information
@_date: 2013-08-02 17:44:16
Will definitely look into that! Thanks
@_date: 2013-08-02 21:48:33
emphasis on was
@_date: 2013-10-28 21:49:13
I have no idea how it would make the process any quicker or easier.  Credit card and cash are just as easy.
@_date: 2013-08-29 08:52:05
I think they want to browse places like reddit and other social media sites to check for feedback. If none of them were on reddit or other sites they would have little clue what is being said about them.  If you want your money, then send your identification its simple.  
@_date: 2013-08-02 17:45:26
It sounds extremely interesting, will be doing a lot of research to help me understand so I can soon purchase some coins for myself!
@_date: 2013-08-14 23:56:17
I was tipped only a few dollars, and guess what I already have bought my own bit coins.  Honestly its the small things that get us new users to want to participate and tell others.  I convinced a few friends to purchase bitcoins too!  To think it was all because of a few tips some fellow redditors gave me.
@_date: 2013-08-02 17:26:08
thanks for all the advice, I have high hopes for bitcoin and really want to get into it I'll take a look at Khan.
@_date: 2013-08-02 17:03:27
Sorry, I meant bicoin miners, those little usb things.  I saw a few on ebay for ~$70.  I would pay with USD of course, but I was curious to how well they work or if there are better price/performance options.
@_date: 2013-12-27 17:41:52
Does no one know of [BitMit?] ( They are shutting down but I am really surprised no one linked their site.  They were the exact definition of ebay for bitcoin
@_date: 2013-08-02 20:20:10
Im pretty excited to take my first few steps into bitcoin, there is so much to learn so I am being caution at first before I do anything stupid 
@_date: 2013-08-02 17:23:37
Now only if I knew what to do with this! But thanks :D
@_date: 2013-08-02 18:04:11
Well...... I probably shouldnt mine until I am a bit more experienced, so I guess for now I will just invest and check out the market and what not
@_date: 2013-10-29 00:23:37
The time saved is around 0 seconds considering the transfer time of bitcoins anyway.  Only thing that is good is the fee's as you said.  Don't make bitcoin sound like its some instant process because its not at all. By transaction I mean confirmation.  
@_date: 2013-08-03 08:04:28
God so many tips all in this post, thank you so much for everything.  I know its not a lot but it really makes me feel good about getting into bitcoin
@_date: 2013-08-02 19:49:54
I don't really think its a bad thing bitcoin was introduced, to be honest in the future if not all currency is credits then I will be very surprised.  Eventually coins and paper money will become useless 
@_date: 2013-08-02 17:31:17
Thanks! Ill take a look
@_date: 2013-08-03 18:49:46
well with that I can officially say nothing you said can be taken seriously.  With that childish attitude I can imagine your silly little thoughts are too.  The playdough is in your room, you can go have fun with that :)
@_date: 2013-08-29 06:18:20
Very true, but apparently they are overwhelmed lately and the fact they made an effort to fix it I find great.  
@_date: 2013-08-02 17:26:36
alright, I'll keep researching
@_date: 2013-10-04 18:45:42
You made absolutely no sense with your statement...  yea people have thousands but they are also what you call "RICH" so no fucking shit they have thousands of coins.  Look at me, I am a fucking 19 year old college student and I own coins.  
@_date: 2013-08-04 03:30:14
I dont really understand what you are trying to say.  But thanks I will have a nice life
@_date: 2013-08-02 18:54:48
Thanks so much for the tip!  I think I am going to stick with blockchart.info just beacuse its online and has backup capabilities
