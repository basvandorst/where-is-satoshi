I live in Finland and received the same post card today. Seems like the district court is burning all remaining assets of MtGox in sending international mail.

Any company that is typosquatting their competitors goes directly to my blacklist. If you really think that is a legitimate business tactic.. well, good luck to you.

Can confirm. They actually do taste great.

Why is the "donate with bitcoin" link a text link in the first page, when it should rather be in the payment options in second phase for fair comparison?
How was the time period selected? Is the behaviour consistent during last weeks? Bitcoin version seems to be doing well on fridays, so why not only disable it for saturday and sunday? What about monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday?
I see Mozilla is trying to make solid looking comparison, but it's lacking in many aspects.

Seems like some people are dumb, actually many of them. They are not learning anything from Gox. BTC-e is the second largest exchange at the moment and even though one knows who runs it. They tunnel the money through countries known for money loundry and hide their identities completely.
I hope these people are not crying if one day BTC-e just disappears with everyones money and BTC. However I'm more concerned about the new people that just start using BTC-e because others tell them that it works and is easy because no verifications are needed. We should definitely warn newcomers against using such place, unless they need to launder some dirty money.

I dont see why you are getting downvoted. More data is absolutely needed, not in terms of number of visitors, but in terms of having a fair comparison. If only bitcoin is mentioned in the first page, a significant number of people might think it's bitcoin only and close the page.
A fair comparison would have been to add bitcoin option where it belongs, in the payment tab under or next to CC/paypal. But obviously a fair comparison would not give Mozilla the outcome they want (=bitcoin option causes users to not donate) or they are just incompetent. Not sure.

I think this was panic selling of "stolen" gox coins. The money is now in some bulgarian/russian bank accounts and being withdrawn as fast as possible.

I remember reading that Bitstamp has good relationships with their bank because the bank is owned(?) by bitstamp CEO's/founders father. Or something like that. Can anyone verify?

Cloud services can, and do expose private data to goverment agencies. It's even legal for many goverments to spy on them. If you use your own servers in a physically contolled environment, you only have to make sure your server administrator is trustworthy. No sensitive data should ever leak out, it will stay out of reach from spying agencies.
Amazon might be the most trustworthy could service, but using any cloud service is and will always be a huge risk.

Wikipedia is infested by editors whose sole purpose is to annoy people and make non-positive edits to articles about things they dislike. These are experienced editors who know the rules and guidelines and try to assert themselves as the final authority. Those kind of people are the main reason I stopped my wikipedia editing almost 5 years ago. 90% of stuff was just arguing about minor things and notability guidelines, instead of doing productive work. For example the CNN article that was quoted says has the following title:
"The shady online currency is starting to gain legitimacy in certain parts of the world. When will the regulators catch up?"
So this editor thinks its neutral to just just pick first half of it "CNN has called Bitcoins a shady online currency", when CNN is also saying it is starting to gain legitimacy. While both of the arguments are true, it is in my opinion unfair to pick either one out of the context. Someone could write the last paragraph as:
"Bitcoins links to criminal activities such as money laundering have prompted scrutiny from the FBI, US Senate, and the State of New York, however CNN is saying that Bitcoin is starting to gain legitimacy"
The lede can and should contain information about controversies according to Wikipedia guidelines, but even that should be neutral. Some of the referenced articles are almost a year old, which is a lifetime in digital world.

I really hope people start questioning mtgoxs professionalism after this latest episode. Not that it's  their fault if they indeed are getting ddosed, but for a company that big it is inexcusable to not notify users what is going on.
They have a twitter account, facebook page and even their main site seems to load (slowly). Trading is however completely lagged or halted. Any professional company would replace their site with a notice about what is going on. Don't they learn anything?

Some of the photos are very good, but you should publish them using some proper licence like Creative Commons or even Public Domain if you want to see them used.
Many newspapers/electronic magazines check if they can get pictures for their articles from e.g. Wikimedia Commons, so that would be a good place to upload them. See

Thatäs quite funny. You tell us that some private bitcoin bank that gives 0 hits in google except thread on bitcointalk is somehow more trustworthy. Most ponzi-schemes are "invite-only", because secretive clubs appeal to people and they feel make one feel exclusive. 
By the way you probably meant to say 1.5 months instead of 15.

They indeed selected a good time to publish their service. Perhaps they used some of the millions to rent a botnet for DDoSing gox so their publicity is maximized ;)
Seriously, if they are half as professional at they say, this is good news for bitcoin. At least if they can squeeze in the top 3 or top 5 of exchanges. Competetion is tough and will be tougher, strongest will survive.
