Thank you
@_date: 2017-06-01 19:33:35
Ahh alright
@_date: 2017-06-01 20:44:26
So 1 question is can anyone mine?
If so how much does it cost to mine
and how much do you make mining
and is it expensive to mine/
@_date: 2017-06-01 20:15:06
So fees are constantly rising and dropping?
@_date: 2017-06-01 19:44:44
So I use Coin base I would be ok with sending a 1 dollar fee so where do I change it?
@_date: 2017-06-01 19:12:43
Thanks :) xD
@_date: 2017-06-01 19:52:15
Thank you
@_date: 2017-06-01 20:30:06
Ahhh alright thank you for the nice explanation :)
@_date: 2017-06-01 20:06:47
So how would you chose the amount of time it takes for your payment to go through?
@_date: 2017-06-01 20:28:35
Oh alright, so what networks out there would cover the fee for me if you know some off the top of your head would you mind listing them for me..
I appreciate your help btw!

I have no idea what u just said tbh
@_date: 2017-06-01 19:34:54
Thank you that makes sense you explained that very well.
So 1 more question
Is there an option for there to be no fee because IDC when the transaction goes through?
@_date: 2017-06-01 20:37:38
Can you explain the miners in a little detail for me.
I understand what it is but I have no idea what they do
THX if u can!
@_date: 2017-06-01 19:53:33
Thx u xD
@_date: 2017-06-01 19:28:10
So the more people that started using bitcoin the more the fees where?
@_date: 2017-06-01 20:47:23
And the hardware that you buy I believe ive seen and its expensive and are there certain sites where you can mine and what do you mine and is it basically like you just making free money?
@_date: 2017-06-01 21:05:52
I'll look into doing that thank you any site that you recommend?
@_date: 2017-06-01 19:22:48
So its the site that he is using that is taking it?
I use Coin base
@_date: 2017-06-01 19:25:26
So its Bitcoin taking the fee not the network whom I am using or the network who I am trying to send to?
Last time I did a transaction "Like 1 month ago" it took 80 cents and before that it was no fee
@_date: 2017-06-01 20:50:17
Ohhh alright I see...
Thanks so much I appreciate it :)
