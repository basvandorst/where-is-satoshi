By that same logic, the most important person in Bitcoin is whoever owns Blockstream. OP isn't stating fact at all, it's propaganda if anything. 
Edit: added "by that same logic"

I think it's more of a statement on how BTC has changed from the plan of the whitepaper. It is definitely misleading to anyone not knowledgeable though.

No, 0-conf is not a layer two. It's not even a feature that was implemented, it's a by-product of other features or the lack of them. 
It just means that a merchant can reliably trust the transaction without having to rely upon any confirmation (0-conf stands for 0 confirmations). The reason why BTC doesn't "have" o-conf is that you can more easily use Replace by Fee to send the transaction somewhere else after the merchant receives the transaction (before the transaction has any confirmations). It is arguable whether or not BCH has reliable 0-conf. The reason why the person replying to OP claims it's reliable for small transactions is that they claim it costs a lot and requires a lot of coordination to replace a 0-conf transaction on BCH, but I don't know the details. 
Bitcoin itself used to have 0-conf btw. That changed when RBF was added.

What do you mean by proof of police?

The idea of Bitcoin can evolve. Bitcoin itself evolves. The whitepaper does not evolve.
If in the future BTC doesn't resemble the whitepaper, does Nakamoto's bitcoin whitepaper still describe BTC? I'm not saying that we have to stick to the whitepaper, I'm just explaining the reasoning behind that quote.

Because the response that Satoshi invented the soft fork was deflecting the point Roger was making. I don't know why Samson would care about Satoshi's opinion at this point because they're not trying to follow his whitepaper.
Have you had a read of Vitalik's post on forks? 
Additionally, Samson is much more technically inept than Roger here. That's not to say I like Roger, he was shilling like mad and he's an immature fool, but he made many good points here.
