"Btc banks the unbaked" is an argument I see often with nothing backing it up, that is why I asked.
How will lightning change it?

Sadly I ca not use bc1 adress because the services I use do not support it, can I send from my segwit wallet to a native one? Or should I just leave it there by now?

I do not think btc will be at that level.
First ot everyone will have btc and second at least 40% of the world does not have internet, and I guess they are unbaked also. So how will btc bank the unbanked? And get fully adopted?
Don't take me wrong I think btc is here to stay but not at the extremes as some people say.
But I would like to know how do you guys thin full adoption will surge.
