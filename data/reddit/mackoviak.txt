Why? People either know already or they couldn't care less. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 12:02:02
Paypal is wonderful. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 12:21:16
I'm genuinely glad to see so many people on here are realistic about the problems facing bitcoin right now. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:59:39
The first coin that can be used in day to day life is the one that will succeed. I'm no crypto expert, but it doesn't seem like Bitcoin is making much progress over the past couple of years. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:59:59
Fractional banking?
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:28:31
I thought bitcoin was the future, lol
@_date: 2018-01-04 11:56:07
What is the market cap for US dollar?
@_date: 2018-01-04 17:33:25
In what way?
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:00:23
Does anybody use bitcoin as money?
@_date: 2018-01-04 12:06:22
Exactly. New investors into crypto are avoiding BTC like the plague once they find out how high transaction fees are and how slow it is. Ethereum &amp; LiteCoin are both better options. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:52:49
Isn't that the same as losing dominance? I mean, to new crypto investors coming in, Bitcoin at the moment isn't all that appealing. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:58:53


Areas without easy access to banks are prime for using crypto. As someone who travels frequently, I would love to avoid currency exchange fees and atm fees in foreign countries - though I think Bitcoin probably isn't the future of crypto. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:21:52
So you're saying the value of Bitcoin isn't that impressive?
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:59:28


Over the long haul it's almost irrelevent if 6 years ago for 15 minutes the price was artificially inflated. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:57:12


Maybe fix the ridiculous transaction fees first, lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:03:48
So people are basically crying because Bitcoin Cash (which they don't like) was added to Coinbase? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:58:04
Well if you are trying to play 20% gains you've already lost. That's an absurd way of going about things. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:53:21
It really is entertaining, thought somewhat pathetic. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:04:08
LOL If this is considered a serious attack on Bitcoin, then Bitcoin is not that great to begin with. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:45:43
How so?
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:16:01
Godd advice. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:14:13
And we all made money! Big deal!
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:13:47
Oh I agree completely. The transaction fees associated with bitcoin are just too ridiculous. If cryto transactions are to ever become more widespread - bitcoin won't be involved in that movement (if it does come).
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:49:11
If it's a baseless opinion, then it is of no value. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:05:00
So who was doing the insider trading? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:51:15
How could I lose 20% of my investment in a couple hours? Like what scenario unfolds where that happens?
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:38:11
Just moving forward with crypto currency, I just don't see much use for something with long transaction times &amp; expensive fees. Not to say I think Bitcoin Cash is anything special, but right now in my personal experience - I avoid Bitcoin as much as possible. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:14:13
So Coinbase should never add addtional coins because the owner couls have pumped all his Bitcoin into whatever coin they are adding? 
Had they announced 24 hours prioer that Bitcoin Cash was being added - do you honestly believe the price wouldn't have skyrocketed at that point instead? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:19:44
Or someone that doesn't like making money. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:08:08
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:23:53
Because BTC doesn't look good long term. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:33:21
How is Bitcoin Cash a shit coin? Or are you just mad you got left out?
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:50:05
When do we come online?
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:03:44
I would say "noobs" such as myself probably do not care. Mostly because it has no bearing on my investment. So far I've seen zero reason to leave Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:26:32
"site wide ban" aka just open a new accoint
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:38:41
You got served. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:01:44
By your rationale, wouldn't there have been insider trading before they announced it?
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:03:27
Did anybody lose money because of it? Can it be proved that there was insider trading? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:27:32
Posts like these aren't exactly helping the credibility of bitcoin supporters. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:52:05
Then what's the problem?
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:16:29
The volatility is what makes it great for day trading. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:11:26
Not understanding the problem. With so much money being made last night, who could possibly be upset?
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:51:11
As I'm new, I'm having trouble understanding; what makes Bitcoin better than Ripple? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:48:47
How could I lose 20% of my investment in a couple hours? Like what scenario unfolds where that happens?
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:32:43
So this Lightning network will reduce transaction fees and time? This is something being built currently or theoretical?
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:17:46
Some people have to learn the hard way. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:34:45
This is what happens when bitcoiners miss out on something I guess. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:15:00
Meh, Bitcoin needs lower transaction fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:15:53
Price drops 20% in an hour:
My number of coins remains the same. No loss. 
I'm waiting to buy. Gain more coins. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:22:20


So BCH is better?
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:24:45
Good point. It'll be very interesting when bitcoin is finally dethroned. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:24:27
What's the worst that can happen?
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:16:16
I have and I'm finding Ripple a lot more appealing. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:12:40
No, actually it doesn't.
