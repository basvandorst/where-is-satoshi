How is the Tracking Number for SR Support encrypted to be readable by both Support and the Buyer?         
How is a vendors profile encrypted? Buyer profiles?
 
People need to realize that PGP messaging does not make oneself completely secure.

You rely heavily on the assumption buyer and vendors willingly will not put personal information, and will always use PGP. Unfortunately this is not true, not even for the majority of buyers.         
There is honestly no reason to argue against native encryption - yes, PGP is secure but then why not just email the buyers directly instead of using this platform? Convenience.        
 
If you build a platform to facilitate sales in an illegal nature you absolutely need native encryption and proof that you actually use it, along with many other security standards.      
These markets are not just built for those that have many years experience in remaining anonymous - it is also geared towards new users that may not be aware of all of the security needed. Yes, they should not send cleartext messages but that is no way to justify not using encryption on a site like this.

Citation Needed for that claim. Yes, there have been incidents where they have, but it is nowhere near a common occurance.     
This would be a long term honeypot - they would provide the medium to solicit narcotic sales and mine the information that is provided to identify sellers, buyers, distributors, ect. in a long term (1-3 year) plan. Even if they did solicit narcotics illegally commonly, they would benefit much more if they simply provided the medium to do so.

There is still a large amount of backend information that is not able to be encrypted, such as vendor information, vendor profiles, buyer profiles, ect.

As a 1% Vendor for 3 years in BMR and SR1.0, we can say that around 60% of orders were placed without using PGP, 70% of messages did not use PGP, and any order that had tracking included was heavily requested. We did not do business with some for this reason, but that didn't mean that personal info was not sent unencrypted.                   
And vendor/buyer profiles due to personal information. Sure some may "do it right" but the majority do not, and that is why native security standards are needed.

Tracking Numbers through resolution, BTC transaction chain (albeit tumbled), vendor information, raw images uploaded from vendors...

Considering the plane ride and risking mailing it back to yourself, the logistics of going to Uruguay and back to resupply is much more costly thn simply getting it locally for $90 per ounce.

Can you provide some source that indicates information is not stored in a database? Burden of proof is on you, by default you should not trust hidden services.         
These are not messages - vendor information, vendor profiles, buyer profile,s and more are stored locally and without encryption.       
It's not just the messages that an be incriminating - profiles and photo's can be as well.

We don't think SR 2.0 has quite that many successful transactions yet.

Simply saying "Just use PGP" does not make this a secure system. Sure, PGP messages are secure, but vendor profiles, buyer profiles, tracking numbers, support messages, BTC transactions, Refunds Issued, and much more information is not encrypted by the client, so a native encryption system should be implemented.        
Yes, we know PGP is secure, and everyone should use it, but they don't. We have been vending for 3 years and the majority of our orders are never pgp encrypted.       
This is why you force native encryption - on our personal sites we use a cryptdb for our backend when needed, although we have become fond of flat file systems as they are easier to encrypt and have a much higher read speed than encrypted databases.       
This is supposed to be a open-source decentralized system, there is no reason users should simply say "you'll never know" - just read the source and you'll see what security measures are taken. But - as of now they have yet to delivery the source.
@_date: 2013-11-07 18:28:41
To an extent yes. On our site we use a modified version of Quick Cart, of which is open source and available for download. As for security we explain and provide our methods of hosting, which is an encrypted flat file system.        
All of our methods rely on open source software and programs that are available free of charge from github.         
These include AES Encryption, PGP Encryption, Disabling Scripts, and offering complete transaction behind PGP messages.       
We use both preventative and native methods, meaning we offer native encryption and security (as stated above), as well as preventative measures involving informing and educating our clients about the types of security offered and walkthroughs on how to use it effectively (such as AES or PGP).      
_____       
Encryption scripts can be open source without being compromised. PGP is still unbreakable and open source. There are many options for offering the review of scripts, such as github and anonymous alternatives.

Is this the SR that is Open Source and Decentralized?
@_date: 2013-11-07 17:31:11
And there's one of the reasons we will not be vending on SR2.0 for at east 6 months.

Fed's cannot sell narcotics, however hosting the marketplace for it and data mining isn't *dealing* narcotics. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 03:51:33
True. However this type of marketplace would most likely be a long term sting, so they could both mine data and provide the medium for indirect narcotic sales.

Again, the burden of proof is on you, you should always assume a hidden service to be untrustworthy. Can you provide the source code or official statement with evidence backing up these security measures? 
@_date: 2013-11-07 16:51:26
That's correct, but still doesn't answer our question: Unless you can provide proof that SR2.0 uses these measures (and doesn't simple say they do), then you should assume the service doesn't actually take said security measure.      
PGP messaging may be secure, but that means nothing when some information isn't even encrypted.         
______       
We need proof of a native encryption process on both backend and databases. Unless this can be provided, it should be assumed this is not used.
@_date: 2013-11-07 18:50:43
Very true - however providing a script open source is a method of assuring customers that it has been implemented.             
For instance - native PGP encryption. Set up a script that encrypts a message client side, prior to being passed to the server, by only using the vendors public pgp key. The script can be open source but the security relies on PGP, which is regarded as currently unbreakable.      
You don't have to develop your own encryption standard, you just have to implement it and use unique keyfiles/public keys.    
This is just an example, there are many methods to provide security resources.       
As for native encryption - it is not a certyain type of security, just having security offered by default. This can be anything from a elaborate encryption system for databases to a simply vendor doing business over email and always using PGP. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 18:15:01
One could argue that decreasing security measures would increase personal security measures, and that it would also be widely avoided.       
Native Encryption can be trusted as long as the methods used to encrypt is presented. You can't just say "We encrypt stuff" as proof that you actually are providing server side encryption.         
We run our own marketplace over TOR and I2P vending illegal narcotics (in some areas - cannabis worldwide) so we know enough about Native Security to remain safe. For instance, we require a PGP key for placing an order, as well as offering full email encrypted orders where none of your personal info touches a non-encrypted platform.
@_date: 2013-11-07 17:45:34
By native encryption we mean encryption &amp; security measures that are included in the sites basic operation at the lowest level, to prevent any data from being passed from one machine to another unencrypted, and without the users actively encrypting all messages.      
_____     
Basically, we hold them to perform all the encryption and security standards that they claim to. This is supposedly a decentralized marketplace but at the time this cannot be verified.           
There is no reason that when hosting a hidden service that deals with illegal items you should rely in part on the customers to provide the security/encryption.           
While unfortunate as it is that so many people do not use encryption on illegal purchases, it is still going to happen so native encryption and an open community would be a great start for new user base (which we will see much of with the amount of press this is generating).
@_date: 2013-11-07 02:45:18
Quite easily - we are the ones vending (usually).
