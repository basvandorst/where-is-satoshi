If I gave some diamonds to a diamond trader to hold whilst I finish a sale and he steal them should he get away with it?
Diamonds aren't money so is it ok to steal them?

No it would be 500*0.1
Then 550*0.1
For a total of $115

Say he paid 1000 bitcoin to get an ASIC miner and they refunded him 10 bitcoins as the value of bitcoins changed.
He wants the other 990 bitcoins and the judge is saying that as he have them 1000 BTC he should get 1000 BTC back.
Say you pay 100g of gold for something, they don;t deliver on time and you get a refund, but because the value of gold has gone up they only refund you 50g of gold. That is what BFL did and it is illegal.

Yeah the snapshots are the latest code.

Not if your node and the network can't communicate because your router is blocking it.

Just a note that if you use commercial equipment, OpenWRT or LEDE you will need to enable UPnP on your router as it is disabled by default for security reasons.
@_date: 2017-10-17 13:10:20
Nah it can be patched, basically the issue is that when your device is trying to connect to the router it will hand out the keys to anyone who asks, so before the router asks for the keys another device could ask and your device would hand it the keys.
Windows, OS X and Linux have patches already, Android is getting the patch in the November security patch and I don't know about iOS but probably soon. Updating your router firmware will also help.
@_date: 2017-10-17 13:14:48
LEDE 17.01.4 has the patch but isn't out yet, they have decided to wait a few days and bundle in a few other security patches for other things.

Depending on what settings your PC has setup, once they have access to your router they could install a self signed cert on your PC and then intercept the traffic like corporate offices do. Still using HTTPS but using your self signed cert whrre the traffic goes though a proxy where it is decrypted first then re-encrypted with the sites key.

I do have max credit score, but the biggest factor is that the UK government is now acting as a guarantor for mortgages given to young people, so even if I failed to pay the bank would still get their money.

My bank told me I was eligible for a mortgage of up-to £1m the other day with a 5% deposit (with 10% APR).

The transaction had already been processed in this case.


He wasn't using a wallet, he was using a bulk transfer tool.

Type an account number wrong with a bank transfer and you are fucked.
This can and does happen with ponzi money like USD all the time.

This is actualy failry harmless as it doesn't use --no-preserve-root
So if you know much about UNIX systems you could recover your system.
But I'm guessing not many UNIX experts will fall for this.
