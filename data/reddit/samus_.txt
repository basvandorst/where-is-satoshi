I think one should read all if possible, otherwise you're actively seeking positive feedback not a real opinion.

are you sure about this? I thought the transaction was signed and that was public information (due to the p2p nature of the system).
also, nothing prevents some individual from sharing your hash, thus receiving money from other sources.


again, it as my understanding that the transaction were public, in any case supporting illegal activities and money laundering is a sure way to get this shit dead off the ground, if it is going to be a viable alternative it must be accepted by the established system, like it or not.






that doesn't make a difference, as a user of the system I'm not interested on how it works.
























well if this is the case then it's a separate problem from the usability of names and should be addressed on its own, if you can't trace the money the system is completely useless.

can you tell me why is it a mess to have a single address? nobody has a different bank account or telephone number or even mail address per recipient (only the most tech-savvy use gmail with "+labels" but it's mostly to recognize spam sources, I don't do that for instance).

it's not for me to create but I can assure you this will block mainstream usage.
