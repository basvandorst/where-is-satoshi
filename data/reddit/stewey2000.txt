The value of the u.s. dollar isnt based on anything tangible either. And i think that the way bitcoin cant be inflated is fundamentally better. And i believe that people will recognize this in time and choose the better system

i know it isnt in reality, but regular people like to see value represented as a higher number on their paycheck and not one that goes down, it isnt a math problem its a human psychological barrier

we dont, but the irs does apparently, and so we have to care. right now in the US if u want an atm you need to register as a provider of financial services, but if bitcoin is property and not a currency, then why shouldnt it be as easy as getting a vending machine?

well, it could try

Voat also got cut off from paypal or were at serious risk of it too. Maybe this is an opportunity for bitcoin to save the day?

Aparently, yeah its kinda sad, there isnt even a link on their donate page. So its possible that one employee is being sneaky I dont know when this wallet was made either
@_date: 2015-03-24 20:52:00
I received an email from them, this is. The link to send bitcoin to the sunlight foundation.

Of course

Cause fiat currencies can be manipulated to inflate or not, and bitcoin is better than gold because gold has practical uses, so if a physical currency could be backed by bitcoins it might help technology illiterate people adopt it.
