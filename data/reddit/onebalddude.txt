Where do u look at short vs long stats?
@_date: 2019-07-10 20:53:31
Good to see you realized how ignorant your post was and removed it ;)
@_date: 2019-07-08 21:08:55
Buy a 10$ one to test, see how bad fees are, and let us know

If you're hoping BTC will make you happy, you are in it for the wrong thing. Acquire BTC, find hobbies, find friends and find love.
@_date: 2019-07-10 21:01:32
My only agenda was that your post was so dumb I had to say something.
Good luck with your "numbers"
@_date: 2019-07-01 04:13:57
And if BTC does rise the shorts will have to cover their position. It could go either way

Screaming "troll" is always the best strategy when you have no idea what you're talking about

More people are betting the price will go down than are betting it will go up

Eventually they will get it right and it's called a short squeeze
edit: you changed your ATH to ATL

They made lightning easy and people make fun of the fact the hard drive is plugged in by a cable.

Can you prove this?

He provided reasoning, not a recommendation
@_date: 2019-03-25 21:01:50
awwww helll yeahhhh
@_date: 2019-11-06 03:58:39
He introduced young fans to Bitcoin. Hope some really dig into it and see Bitcoins value

Typical salty post during a bear market

Read the story. He tries to pull his money off immediately and was blocked for months. Worse luck ever

Your only option is a family member with a debit/credit card.

I never understood the purpose of businesses to buy BTC. Everything can be done online and peer to peer

I started utilizing YouTube because of crypto news channels in 2015.... eventually that grew to a paid YouTube subscription. 
Today I complained to customer service, put in a feedback complaint, and then UNSUBSCRIBED from my premium account. 
YouTube is just a platform. More platforms will pop up and YouTube will have to change their policy or they will be replaced.

When you 100x leverage, the outcome is you will be liquidated. 
If you make a little money (like most do) you will make 1 bad decision and immediately be liquidated. Days, weeks or years of "good" decisions immediately liquidated from one bad decision.... And you are completely forgetting how expensive fees are.
Margin trading is supposed to seem like a sure thing. Exchanges mouths start drool when they see posts like this.
@_date: 2019-12-26 22:28:36
Makes sense to me. Bitcoin fluctuates. They have to ensure its profitable for them to take BTC.
@_date: 2019-12-26 23:00:51
What exchange are the using? Are they using their own rate? If so, it could be true.
And telling you the price in BTC and their conversion in USD means it is not fraud.

Classic phishing scam. Make sure you report their number if it wasn't blocked.

How much did they cost?

Isn't there a slack channel specifically for customer support?
Check your packaging for a support link.
@_date: 2018-12-16 17:25:46
You probably agreed to buy BTC at a more expensive rate than what it is sell for currently.
@_date: 2019-05-25 04:29:20
I can spend my Bitcoin for products and services. Its progress

3650/3212(current BTC price)= 113.6.  You would have to spend $113.60 at that rate to get $100 worth of BTC.
At that rate you are paying a 13.6% premium on the price of BTC. And the price of BTC constantly changes. So you will, more than likely, never have exactly $100 worth of BTC

Stop reading the news and educate yourself on the facts

Judging from his house in the 60 Minutes episode, he isn't hurting. He paid 10k BTC for a pizza in 2010. I'm pretty sure he's rolling in BTC.
