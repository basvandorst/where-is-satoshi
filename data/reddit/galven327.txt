wouldn't that only count if the bill was made to be unusable? which is not the case here?

Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, so if it's worth that much to you, that's its price.
@_date: 2019-02-03 11:44:52
I think that's a bear
@_date: 2018-11-16 08:59:12
so, what happend to BCH?

a journey of a 1000 miles beings with a single step 
@_date: 2018-11-17 21:58:12
Why? Though im 70% sure it's a group of people.
@_date: 2019-01-29 18:56:56
hmm, Macedonia banned bitcoin? Interesting, when did that happen?

I have no problem with them trying to improve upon the design. Competition is great
@_date: 2019-01-28 00:56:01
trying to build a better currency than the dollar is as pointless as trying to build a better google. Do you now understand why this statement is idiotic?
@_date: 2019-01-11 09:56:07
true, but if they stay it will show a market to people who will force the fee down through competition.
@_date: 2019-01-08 22:33:59
But they aren't trying to will the market into doing it, they believe it will get there on its own.
@_date: 2019-01-25 23:02:22
the most idiotic, pointless statement ever.
@_date: 2019-01-09 13:53:20
You're an inspiration, and don't let them tell you otherwise.
@_date: 2019-01-27 16:37:23
Hope you guys are alright down there.
@_date: 2019-01-10 20:24:13
is the writer German? they have a tendency to fuse words.
@_date: 2019-01-27 19:32:07
just making sure, there's that fire going on, and other things.
@_date: 2019-01-18 17:49:29
No, that's not borderline scamming, that's just scamming.
@_date: 2019-01-11 09:34:33
True, but, and this is a pretty big but, 5% is better than no fee BECAUSE THE SERVICE DOESN'T EXIST.
@_date: 2019-01-18 23:54:26
Bitcoin will grow with a 1000 cuts, not a big push, a bit od adoption here, a bit of adoption there, and boom, over time you have massive growth.
@_date: 2019-01-10 20:22:42
how is that relevant?
@_date: 2019-01-10 22:13:59
....i have no idea what you are trying to say.
@_date: 2019-01-22 00:13:56
r/thegreatmuffin is completely correct, but to add to that is the fact that those that have the most wealth usually create the most wealth. You couldn't take this wealth from them because the minute you take it it would lose almost all it value.
@_date: 2018-02-20 14:25:59
shouldn't it be the other way around?
@_date: 2019-01-16 10:05:04


Oh socialism, never change.
@_date: 2018-02-15 08:22:32
it also prevents those who wish to destroy you from having a single person to focus on, it's much harder to destroy an idea carried by a whole bunch of people then a single person

Let's be honest, the fuel tax was just the straw that broke the camel's back. Things can't last much longer the way they're going now.
