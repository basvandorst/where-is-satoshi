Wow that clarifies a lot of stuff for me. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-05-19 13:20:08
Oh thanks!
@_date: 2014-01-30 05:36:00
Maybe you could add one more to that?
Edit: thanks stranger! Let's keep the gold rolling!
@_date: 2014-05-17 17:21:32
Actually it does that to everyone.
@_date: 2014-05-15 03:39:34
What are some benefits of colored coins? Sorry it's just that I am usually hesitant before doing stuff like this.
@_date: 2014-05-20 01:20:26
Maybe you'll get a cool flair or something!
@_date: 2014-05-16 19:15:15
So the bits are stored outside Reddit? What happens if Changetip gets hacked?
@_date: 2014-05-15 05:43:25
Hmm this is interesting. I guess I'll give this a shot. 
@_date: 2014-05-15 20:53:47
Never done this before...
"C'mon Big Money, Big Money! 
@_date: 2014-05-15 22:52:51
Wow thanks!
@_date: 2014-05-15 17:53:01
Yes I know far more shit but somehow, this post gets downvoted.
@_date: 2014-05-13 06:12:06
I'm just re posting what made. Don't shoot me.
@_date: 2014-05-16 02:10:47
Maybe you can, maybe you can't. Who knows.
@_date: 2014-05-16 22:00:58
@_date: 2014-01-30 05:49:30
Can it rain my way?
@_date: 2014-05-19 21:23:36
Yeah it really is exciting that a team as popular as the Earthquakes has this option now. Hopefully they have discounts! 
@_date: 2014-05-15 17:49:11
That's true but the shibes themselves find it lovable. I don't doubt that there are people who looks down upon it but people tip for the heck of it. They have very little thought about doing it for the price.
@_date: 2014-05-15 17:59:18
No I meant it was downvoted because it contained the word "dogecoin".
@_date: 2014-05-20 01:40:27
Maybe just anther account then...
@_date: 2014-05-19 01:17:38
I like the fact that I has potential to replace credit cards become a widely used form of payment and currency.
@_date: 2014-05-16 00:19:37
You mean like this?
@_date: 2014-05-15 18:00:07
Maybe if this question was put in the FAQ then people would stop asking it.
@_date: 2014-05-19 03:47:57
@_date: 2014-05-16 00:59:44
I can't wait ;)
@_date: 2014-05-20 02:23:12
But the $10 in Bitcoin....
@_date: 2014-05-13 02:09:16
Hehe nice.
@_date: 2014-05-16 00:57:46
The entire community has a feel of generosity and giving to it.
@_date: 2014-05-20 01:36:49
On whichever subs you regularly tip in, you might be able to ask the mods for flair.
@_date: 2014-05-16 01:10:17
I'm new here so I [gave out]( what I had. If this is over that's okay.
@_date: 2014-05-16 19:21:49
Thanks! But is changetip a secure website? Can I keep all my bits there? 
@_date: 2014-05-20 01:25:40
You know...a flair. Like next to your username...
@_date: 2014-05-16 01:42:17
Thanks! 
@_date: 2014-05-16 19:25:05
Awesome thanks!
@_date: 2014-05-15 06:11:41
Sure... I guess...
@_date: 2014-05-15 03:55:01
Here I go!
@_date: 2014-05-17 05:31:59
Oh ok. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-05-15 06:14:21
I hope not ;)
@_date: 2014-05-16 18:27:17
I comment.
@_date: 2014-05-15 17:44:39
Haha that was an interesting read. Thanks for the info! I agree with you that dogecoin is very flippant in the way that it acts. But that what makes the community so lovable. Here it seems that everybody is very serious in everything that they do. But I understand why that is now.
