The latest I read, was that Gavin said that he don't know, so no, not endorsing.

The discussions are happening mostly in Telegram groups.

Probably the same issues that small blocker see, however they/we put the threshold at which point the size become a problem at a higher level, like accepting that you need a decent broad band connection and a decent home server to run a full node and accepting that a raspberry pie is not powerful enough. With that said, I would probably have the small block view too if I saw the most important thing for bitcoin to be ultra decentralised so everyone could run a full node in their pocket so no state would take it over. However, and I could be wrong, I don't share that fear.

Yes, I'm surprised it has not been attacked yet.

My unlimited node is still up.

No Tor. I guess the attacker just did not go after all BU nodes, and let some randomly chosen nodes be. 
And would Tor do any difference? If you can send the attack message to the node, won't it go down regardless if the IP is publicly available or not?

Just a small detail, the mining farm is not in Luleå, it's located in Boden.
The distance between Luleå and Boden is just 30km though.

Lets give it a few days, then we will see what actually is happening. Either it's variance or ViaBTC is lying about their hashrate on their website.

The answer is in this Medium post:

According to viabtc themselves, their hashrate is just marginally down from the day before the unlimited switch. Luck, or lack thereof,  makes the variance high in short time intervalls, but if you check the number of blocks mined over a week or so, then you could see if it is proportional to their reported hashrate.
Variance is just random and has nothing to do with a certain pool (except that larger pools has less variance) or earlier variance. Hashing is just like rolling a dice and if getting a six is mining a block, then you see that if you roll three times you quite easily could get three ones in a row, but if you roll 1000000 times, you will get sixes closer and closer to 1/6 of the rolls. Hashrate is how many times per second you could roll that dice so that's why larger pools should have less variance, because they roll their dice more times per second.

Don't really understand what you mean, could you elaborate?

Do you have any sources that backs your claim?
There are to many on both sides of the block size debate that do not cite any sources, and it's hard to distinguish between conspiracy theories and the truth if claims are not backed up by sources. As an example, I do not give much credibility to the AXA Conspiracy theory that many believe that your own company is a part of, just because there are no good evidence.

It works by having an excessive block (EB) size value and the acceptable depth (AD) value. A block is accepted if it's size is not greater than EB size setting OR if the size is greater than the EB size AND there are at least as many blocks as is set in the AD value built upon the block.
If you want to keep the current rules you set EB to 1 and AD to something like 100000000000 (approx. 2 million years). Then, in practice, your node will not accept anything larger than 1MB blocks, just as today.

That's a Swedish train. They are very often late, so if Bitcoin is like Swedish trains, you've got plenty of time.
