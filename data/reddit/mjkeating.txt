The nice thing for Western Union is that they can easily convert  the BTC to the currency of their choice, even though one might be remitting to a remote, small part of the world.  So, Bitcoin should be a convenient way for them to accept funds for transmission.

Consider, for a moment, that Bitpay and Coinbase have been immediately verifying thousands of transactions with NO confirmations (not even one) and, yet, have never had a problem (not even one) receiving those payments.  Also, consider that, in the extremely unlikely event of a double spend (not easy to do), you could simply remove the customer's relatively inexpensive credits.

If I buy a boat for $1000 and it double in value, do I pay capital gains before I sell it?  No. If it sinks, do I pay capital gains?  No.
Likewise, if it drops in value, one can only claim those losses when one sells - and realizes those losses.  
If one's property is lost, stolen, or destroyed, this is a loss (and not a gain) - regardless of changes in the value of the property since it was purchased.   The loss to be legally claimed may be based on the purchase price or the market price at the time of the loss, depending on applicable laws.

Normally, the miners would not agree to a change in the sha256 hashing algorithm since they're invested in that hardware.  However, when faced with such an attack they would have a big incentive to agree to such a change.  They don't want to lose the value of the Bitcoin they already have and many miners are believers in the idea Bitcoin itself.  Few are going to agree to the new "FedCoin", CommiCoin or whatever.  So, we would likely see a hard fork and a new mining algorithm on the new chain that would undermine the attackers.

Good of you to ask the community.  Be sure to research until you understand what you doing well enough to be satisfied.  Mining is very competitive and many small miners, in the past year or so, have lost money. Most often,  I've read, these people would have done much better just buying bitcoin.

Well, whoever it is, it appears the dead has arisen!  One has to wonder who, other than Satoshi, wouldn't touch the 'dead coins' for all this time.

They make some valid points, but fail to mention the equally valid counter arguments for them - such as: "bitcoin is very early still in the adoption phase" or "MtGox was akin to an incompetent/unscrupulous bank/business failure rather than a failure of the Bitcoin network/technology". 
Of course, most banks stand to lose from a decentralized monetary system.  So, it's not surprising to see this sort of analysis being proffered.

Except for the [network effect]( Consider what makes Facebook so valuable?  Is it the software or that so many friends aready use it?

IMO, the cat is likely out of the bag for Satoshi.  He's most likely been doxed.  Now he should take some of his considerable and well earned resources and adjust his security and his life accordingly.

That's why you keep your encrypted private key backed up somewhere. It's also a good idea to avoid storing all your bitcoin in one place.  If one takes some reasonable precautions bitcoin is pretty safe.

Well, there are also competing precious metals, but gold is still gold and continues to maintain its network effect of perceived value notwithstanding.  There are plenty of similar examples. I think Bitcoin will likely follow this pattern - and that branding, first mover advantage, network effect, etc. will continue to shine for it. 
It's also worth considering that Bitcoin's blockchain security is backed by the most computationally intensive computer network the world has ever seen.  That might be worth something.

I got interested in bitcoin just over a year ago. Advocates have always acknowledged its volatility. Bitcoin is a nascent currency/technology. "Don't invest more that you are willing to lose" has been the good advice.
Whatever the price, it's an amazing technology and adoption has made great strides this past year with several major companies accepting it. Start-up galore are scrambling to get into the space and build the future BTC economy. Yes, it will be a huge improvement when it is more stable, but that should come in time. The Internet didn't start out with streaming movies, online games or even browsers. Patience, grasshopper. These things grow in their own time.

Actually, the $300 price is meaningful at this point.  It appears we have found our bear-whale and he simply wants to unload at this point for $300 per coin.  The $300 sell-wall started at some 23500 coins a few hours ago and now stands at 17,000.  The price hasn't dropped since he posted the sell wall.  That sounds bullish to me.  It's nice to have an idea of what might have been going on and I think investors may be

Bear in mind only one transaction was confirmed - as designed.

You're absolutely right.  Bitcoin DOES have this 'intrinsic value'.  So do many other things people invest in.  And it's natural for people to care about ups and downs of their investments.  Nevertheless, investors tend to stick to their investments in the long run - understanding the underlying value - as opposed to speculators who only care about price fluctuations.

I don't think you make any more BTC with GHash than with smaller pools.  You just get paid smaller amounts more frequently: you find more blocks but must split the BTC reward with more miners.  A smaller pool would reward you less frequently, but dish out larger rewards. It should average out.

"Scam" might be a little harsh, but I do think it's important that these coins start standing up to this sort of scrutiny.  Do we really need a scripting language built into the block chain/protocol?  Perhaps it is better to have such complexity at a higher layer where it can be fixed and managed without posing so much risk to the underlying framework. 
Also, it is not clear to me why these 'bitcoin 2.0' projects cannot simply be released as open source API's  - sort of like a jQuery for bitcoin.  It seems awkward to release such projects as alt-coins - except for the potential lucrative windfall mentioned by the OP.

There's a lot of Circle fans as well that may have downvoted you.  Personally, I haven't had any trouble buying BTC on Circle.  The purchase issues could be for any number of reasons.  Bear in mind that Coinbase has had purchasing issues as well over the past year - two that I know of where there were steep price declines (causing cash flow problems for them because of high buying activity).
Probably not a conspiracy.

I'm not sure that using the Coinbase tip button is 'truly anonymous'. It's a centralized service, like a bank, and leaves a similar record with Coinbase.

I disagree. The power to spend/transfer BTC resides with the private key holder by design and for many good reasons.    Otherwise, we might as well be using banks to confirm transactions.  I don't think the problem is bitcoin.  The problem, rather, is trusting one's BTC to untrustworthy persons.

Though the price hasn't changed much recently, I think bitcoin adoption and legitimacy are doing quite well these days.

The 'right reasons' would include 'investing' in bitcoin as opposed to 'speculating'.  The latter is a hope for price increases within a time frame, while the former is based on an understanding that the technology has sound, long term potential to benefit its users.

There is no reason to wait for 6 confirmations to finalize a BTC transaction. Even after one confirmation, it is in the block chain and it would practically take an act of God to gather a 51% attack to even attempt to reverse that confirmation - and then the reversal is not assured for the attacker. It's just not going to happen. The only time I would demand more than one confirmation is if it was a VERY large amount - like several thousand BTC.  Otherwise, this sort of inconvenience to the user is completely unnecessary.

First of all, what drop-off in [transaction volumes](  
Second, bitcoin only offers advantages for merchants with immediate, non-reversable, payments from customers and the optional immediate conversion to fiat via a payment processor (Coinbase, Bitpay, etc.) - for 1% to no fee at all.  Why would any merchant walk away from this?  It is certainly no skin off the merchant's back to leave the bitcoin payment options available for customers.

It just seems to me that going the altcoin approach is both an awkward way to fund these projects and also an awkward way to release them as development platforms.  Many open source platforms have been released as libraries and API's quite effectively over the years.  jQuery is one example. The alt-coin approach has the appearance of relying, in part, on hype and ignorant greed for a quick windfall of cash.  And it is conceptually strange when a 'coin' is really just a development library/platform.

Wallets are just utility apps to transfer bitcoin balances from one address to another on the blockchain.  When you see a balance in a wallet, it's just showing you the balance total for bitcoin controlled by the private keys that wallet has access to.  Those private keys can be easily moved to a different wallet. So, the wallet itself is really pretty irrelevant.

The bitcoin mining network is huge and very secure.  This would not be the case, at this point, without the bitcoin reward miners get.  These miners are the security of the network - the integrity of the distributed ledger.  This is real value and one of the important reasons for the underlying value of bitcoin.  So, yes, bitcoin needs the blockchain, but the blockchain also needs bitcoin.

The work that miners do is to confirm transactions by solving deliberately difficult hashing puzzles. These confirmed transactions make up the block chain.  The chain with the most work (computing power) done on it is considered the valid chain.  This assume most computing power is held by honest nodes (miners).  This is the bitcoin network's security.
An over powered mining pool can possibly undermine this security. Its pool operators would be in a position where they could over power the honest miners and perpetrate double spending or otherwise screw with what should be valid transactions.

@_date: 2015-09-14 00:21:21
I can see alt-coins as being off topic - else folks would be flooding this subreddit with posts promoting their alt-coins.
XT, however, is not a coin at all unless there is a successful bitcoin fork in its favor - then it will become bitcoin. Until then it is nothing more than a very important proposal.
But theymos objects to implementing such proposals that could result in a hard fork and don't have near 100% agreement in the community. He feels such proposals, once implemented, are an attack on bitcoin. So, he has declared XT an alt-coin and therefor off-topic - even though it isn't an altcoin an is very much on topic to bitcoin and it's future - for good or bad.  As such, it should be wide open for discussion, in my view.
@_date: 2015-09-12 06:27:05
It seems to me that if someone implements an idea that depends on a hard fork, such an implementation isn't, of itself, a hard fork. A hard fork that happens is a hard fork. Before the hard fork such an implementation is still a proposal. After the hard fork the implementation becomes bitcoin. 
An alt-coin, on the other hand, must be backed-up by a alternate block-chain - or it's not an alt-coin.
With all due respect, theymos, it appears you are making up definitions and rules and then imposing them on the community with the effect of squelching discussion. 
@_date: 2015-09-07 17:53:21
That miners are haven't yet moved to XT mining software does not imply that people don't want the issue discussed.  
Also, XT nodes have been getting DDoSed causing the shutdown (hopefully temporary) of many - notably those of Slush pool which was consistently gaining traction on XT mining.
@_date: 2015-09-14 02:26:16
Yes, it was in the Q and A session that he mentioned quit openly/honestly that he has 'very socialist' views.
I'm also looking forward to the time when bitcoin is used as currency with such regularity.  Bear in mind, [bitcoin will require a much larger block size]( as the current 1MB size limits us to a miniscule 3 transactions per second or so - worldwide.
@_date: 2015-09-04 17:46:46
Note that off-chain payments, like ChangeTip, go back to relying on trusted third parties. Perhaps that is fine in limited circumstances, but I think it's important to scale the blockchain so that anyone can seamlessly send bitcoin to anyone else.
@_date: 2015-09-08 22:21:50
Well, in about six to 10 months or so, they say we'll be running out of BTC transaction bandwidth because of the block size limit.  So, it seems you can care now or care later if bitcoin matters to you.
@_date: 2015-09-13 03:46:25
I didn't hear Nick explain the connection, other than people who care about transaction's per second have lost sight of security and the ability to transact across borders, etc. They are more like Visa and Paypal types in their mentality. (the topic starts at 37:35) 
Personally, I don't think this is true at all. Increasing the capacity to transact in bitcoin will bring these benefits of bitcoin (decentralized security, borderless transactions, etc) to more people as bitcoin becomes ever more popular.
@_date: 2015-09-08 04:07:03


There is no organized downvoting that I know of.  It could actually be that your suggestion (Gavin should start an altcoin) is being received as weak and a real eye-roller. Sorry. 
Also, the general squelching of open discussion on these issues is, apparently, unpopular.  Many find such censorship of relevant topics in forums such as this abhorrent. I suspect it turning sentiment away from the moderators.
@_date: 2015-09-13 03:36:53
It's not clear to me how increasing the block size, to allow for the inevitable increase in transaction demand, affects censorship resistance or bitcoin security. It seems like a non-sequitur.  
@_date: 2015-09-07 16:57:56
If that is the case, perhaps we should let an open discussion of both sides continue. It seems that a proposed fork to scale bitcoin has been characterized as an alt-coin and banned from discussion while side-chains are just fine as a topic (as they should be). Personally,  I'd prefer that we scale bitcoin transaction bandwidth in the bitcoin protocol itself before we depend on side-chains.  At the very least, we shouldn't fear being banned from for discussing the issue along with it's pertinent players, proposals, and implementations.
@_date: 2015-09-13 03:48:49

@_date: 2015-09-12 16:07:22
Implementations that don't have near 100% consensus and require a hard fork are seen as a threat to bitcoin by theymos.  So, he makes up definitions that such implementations are altcoins and, therefore, off topic.  If course, that such implementations are altcoins is absurd since they have no block-chain of their own and are useless unless they gain enough of a consensus to successfully fork.  Furthermore, such a fork was never designed to require near 100% consensus. This is an arbitrary standard that theymos and others simply want.
@_date: 2015-09-13 16:29:22
Exactly. Blocksize is nothing, it seems, compared to equipment and electricity costs.  Making it so really appears like a Red Herring and casts conflict of interests suspicions upon the Blockstream crowd - who would rather we depend on thier LN and side-chains than a scalable bitcoin protocol.
@_date: 2015-11-12 03:58:03
It's called a 'conflict of interest' and it's an obvious issue in this case, regardless of Blockstream's intentions, goodness, etc. That this is a reality is really beyond debate - and it is a legitimate cause for concern. 
@_date: 2015-11-30 20:04:09
There's not. But, apparently, miners can tag a block with their preferred BIP as a sort of vote.

My understanding is that, originally, Satoshi did not limit the block size. He added the 1MB limit when he did as an easy way to prevent certain DOS attacks.

Not sure it'll do for 5 to 10 years, but it's a start.  If we don't cripple the bitcoin transaction bandwidth,  I'd expect increased confidence in general and adoption to start following from bigger players as well as small - with transaction volume along with it.

Protecting uses (if they need protection) from those ideas/features you disagree with should really come from transparent and open discussion.

Time to get some Catnip with my Darkcoin...

Well, even if that's true, bitcoin beats it at 3 cents or so per transaction.

Bitcoin is gentlemen.

There's nothing wrong with 'promotion' in an forum where other's can offer their con's to your pro's - which is how things are debated everywhere. This is simply rank censorship. And it's pretty disturbing to see when bitcoin itself is largely about decentralising power and transactions that cannot be censored.

[Janet Yellen said]( last year, that the Fed has no authority to regulate bitcoin.

He has his own wallet in addition to his Circle account - that is not the issue.

It's reasonable to think that the scalability of bitcoin is at an urgent point and to act on that conviction. The 'wedge' can just as validly be said to come from the viciousness of those opposing said developer.

'Local currency' would encourage spending in local areas.

Here's a [recent youtube update]( (Feb 3) from developers.

Lies, as well as bait-and-switches, can and should be exposed through open discussion. Censorship makes no sense.

Wow - yeah, like now :)

Very sorry to hear this.  Here is [Adam explaining bitcoin](

Not to mention, it's a stupid question. What person on earth is going to say 'Why, yes. I do use my cell phone for illegal activity. So good to get that off my chest.'

I've seen a number of 'leveling off' periods. Big moves, it seems, tend to hit rather suddenly.

I'm not sure what bitcoin, print mags, and National Geographic have to do with atheism.

Huh? what?...dead? I've been using Multibit as my primary wallet for over a year.

Fungibility is an important consideration.

I didn't even realize I was playing. I'm not an atheist - who are apparently getting checkmated for some reason.

Yeah, and maybe we should mention that cash, roads, and an the internet itself are also involved in such nefarious behavior - along with a plethora of other good, useful things. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:47:08
You're whistling past the graveyard, imo. Something that has been going on for some time now.

No - the miners are divided and are signaling for both, some for SegWit, some for EC.  Everyone wants to scale, but they don't agree on the road ahead.
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:51:26
It's true, ETH has scaling concerns as well. But, at its current level, it already has 3 to 5 times the capacity of BTC. Also, the community is not so divided on the scaling solution.

This has been a pet peeve of mine for some time. In the U.S. the War on 'X' (poverty, drugs, terrorism, illiteracy, etc) really means 'we want extra-constitutional power' over your resources and liberty - and since it's a war we won't tolerate critical thinking nor, God forbid, dissent.

Actually, if you want to buy something because you're convinced of its long term value, temporary low prices are a good thing.

And there's a beautiful woman from Nigeria in it for you too - after you accept the $10 million your distant dead relative left you.  Just send you bank account info and $2,300 for the plane ticket.

Because the Bitcoin network will be more highly valued.  It presents a remarkably secure, peer-to-peer medium of exchange of a predictably limited resource . This is amazing utility and real value.

So, Chinese people can buy and sell Bitcoin as a commodity, but cannot use it as currency.  What I find it ironic about this is that Bitcoin is so valuable because of its amazing usefulness as currency in the first place.
