How does that make sense, the definition of decentralized from Wikipedia is "the process of redistributing or dispersing functions, powers, people or things away from a central location or authority". If you mean it will be controlled by a centralized group of people I think you have a bad understanding of bitcoin.

I don’t think any crypto currency is ready to be used as an actual currency yet
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:29:14
It comes down to which coin has had the best storage of value in the past which has been bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:52:20
I plan to go to sleep in a minute so this might be my last response but for bitcoin only being backed by investors with no intrinsic value that is the same as the stock market and fiat currencies, the only stores of value with intrinsic value are resources that don’t have real intrinsic in that their values are inflated past their uses. I agree that technological issues and unstable price (despite trending upward) prevent it from being a currency but I don’t see an issue with this. Bitcoin does not need to be a currency to experience growth it just needs to be able to be quickly exchanged for fiat anonymously.
As for 3rd generation coins I have already said my opinion on alt coins being that fees and wait times don’t prevent bitcoin from being currency, the problem goes much deeper. The one thing holding all of crypto back from being currencies is a medium of exchange because of constantly changing prices. The one thing crypto needs is storage of value as I already said.

The true experts aren’t giving free financial advice on this sub, everyone saying hold and making told you so posts are either doing it for their own gain or internet points. At the end of the day we’re all invested in the success of the coin in one way or another and don’t want to see other people lowering the price by panic selling.
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:30:19


Yes there are a lot of things that could crash the prices which is why I recommend it not being your man store of value...


This is wrong. The only crash significant enough that you could call it a bubble like event would be the Mt Gox hack. Not every crash is a bubble.


Yeah that’s why I’m not calling it a currency. My opinion on crypto currencies being used as actual currencies is that their price is too volatile, as both of us pointed out, for them to ever be used as a common measure for value.

Do you think their would be more employment if the Renminbi appreciated? The second part of what you said is ridiculous, they’re not advocating for lower wages they’re just writing about the current state of the Chinese economy. They have hundreds of other articles on China too that are great.
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:51:37
Yeah almost definitely both if it’s an exchange, from what I’ve seen this guys job at Microsoft is to be an expert in block chain technology. It may even be they don’t open an exchange and just release something like LN seeing as they don’t do anything like exchanges right now.
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:49:15
Geez back then 36 BTC was 4 grand now that cab drive would now be coming up to 700k
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:39:57
Either way if they open a exchange that would be massive for bitcoin and ethereum especially because it looks like he’s trashing on bitcoin cash.
EDIT: Microsoft added to ability to purchase with bitcoin a while ago. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:06:32
I don’t think it was a hit piece simply that they wanted to put bitcoin in a title for views.
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:36:23
Oh whoops 
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:13:49
I never said that it should be your main store of value but saying bitcoin is not currently a store of value is wrong. You’re simply ignoring the past trends and actual data of bitcoin so far for a hypothetical situation where someone would crash the market and potentially loose billions of their own money.
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:23:14


Bitcoin has never dropped 90% there is nothing to suggest it will drop 90%.


This is a valid opinion but to say the government will take action that will result in bitcoins lowering of value is a bold prediction. I think increased regulation is good for bitcoins growth bad for it as a currency.

People who buy 10$ worth of bitcoin are most likely going to use it for its intended purpose.
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:16:19
The reason I think it’s not an exchange is because Microsoft doesn’t do that kind of thing right now but it definitely could be an exchange. Either way more mainstream investment in bitcoin is good, a company like Microsoft would definitely help gain the public’s trust of the BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:55:10
I don’t understand this, who would spend bitcoins on a car when in a couple minutes your coins could be worth several thousand more than what you paid.

Or they could buy and keep in coin base

I’m pretty sure he said in the video exactly what you’re saying.
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:59:23
This is why the original bitcoin, despite higher fees and longer waits, is better at the moment. No one is using crypto as a currency right now because there’s no common measure. One bitcoin or any alt coin might be worth x today but in a couple hours it could be worth several hundred more. To put prices in crypto right now would be pointless because they’re constantly changing. So the best crypto right now comes from which one has the best store of value which is undoubtedly the original bitcoin. Over time crypto will be used as currency but right now that’s simply not what people will use it for so fees and wait times are almost entirely irrelevant.
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:05:45
Where do I get this
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:35:33
A lot of bitcoins aren’t on the market because of lost keys but yeah these numbers are complete bullshit I’m pretty sure OP looked at how many current sell offers there are between the current price and 40k on a single exchange and added them up which makes no sense.

If he has more bitcoins where that came from life payed him back already 
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:02:19


On that same Wikipedia page it lists gold as a store of value, do you believe someone should put all of their money into gold?


This is not what it said it did not say at any point you’re intentionally changing what it said. With many of the store of values it gives they have ups and downs like gold it doesn’t mean that they aren’t a store of value. Bitcoin is becoming increasingly regulated for instance in South Korea.


This is completely false. The US government considers bitcoin and other crypto as commodities similar with guess what, other stores of value.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:30:44
I mean if bitcoin continues to go up in value banks or individuals could make a bigger profit from simply hodling their coins.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:40:55
The first part is exactly what the articles and I wrote...
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:05:25
I completely disagree with you I think that is bitcoins only purpose at the moment and will be for a while. The volatility is preventing it from being a currency but not as a store of value. The only thing that matters is bitcoins value long term which has obviously only been upwards and will most likely continue that way. Day to day volatility is meaningless if your not going out and spending the money.

I don’t believe you should put all your money into any single investment tool this might be the worst argument I’ve ever heard.


Yes I believe it to be predictably useful when retrieved at some points it may go down in value but the overall trends are up.


Would you suggest to someone to not put money into an index fund on the stock market because of crashes? The overall trend of the stock market is up despite individual crashes.

Basically inflationary currencies encourage spending. When there is no encouragement to invest or spend your money people simply want to hold onto their currency as much as possible like what’s going on with BTC right now.

@_date: 2018-02-19 05:45:00
Exchanges really are layer two in my opinion considering they allow off chain trading. They are not ideal however because the whole point of Bitcoin is decentralization exchanges have a pretty crazy trust factor involved and most require you to disclose your true identity (at least for fiat sales). I'm not sure what you mean by leadership from private companies but the lightning network is made by a private for profit company. If that's not what you mean have been seeing recently that Microsoft is very interested in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-19 05:35:38
He could have been actually money laundering with the Bitcoin you never know. Anyway it's his fault for associating his wallet with his real identity.
@_date: 2018-02-19 05:28:27
It's more worrying to me. I want individual people to be able to effect the market as little as possible and these addresses increasing their holdings, while showing they believe in bitcoins future, means they can have a greater effect on the price.
