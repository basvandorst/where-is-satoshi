Got my Trezor One off Amazon and can confirm no issues so far. Package was sealed so tightly I literally had to rip the box open to get it out.

I have seen one person argue that 12 words are more secure because 12 words is few enough to memorize vs 24 so if say you’re crossing a border somewhere you don’t risk carrying your seed words period in any form.

Yeah I stopped buying from cashapp when I noticed the rate was always like $100-200 higher than coinbase. I’d rather pay the small fees from coinbase. I haven’t sold any through cash app though so I wonder if the higher rate applies when selling.

You can watch the vids now but you won’t be able to take the quizzes that earn you the shitcoins until you get the email saying welcome to coinbase earn. Once you’re eligible coins earned are instantly tradeable. I converted mine into btc as soon as I got them. It took about 1-2days from signing up before I got the email saying I was ready.

I use an app called HODL
@_date: 2019-07-01 23:32:11
Tell me about it. Started buying in back when it was at 8k only like $10 a day for shits and gigs, fomo’d hard when it started climbing and now I’m full blown HODL in the span of 2.5 weeks.

Coinbase never asked me for proof of address while verifying. Linking my debit, bank account, and drivers license was enough.

This was cash app not Robinhood. Cash app lets you deposit into an external wallet if you want.

God I love this rollercoaster we call bitcoin

Duly noted in that case what cold wallet do you guys recommend? I’m interested in the Bluetooth features of the ledger x but would that mean it’s wireless and thus inherently less safe?

^I got in at 8k and started very small only buying $10 a day and a few big purchases here and there and have accumulated 0.1 btc and profit is already past +$100. NUT UP AND BUY
@_date: 2019-06-29 00:28:04
Would the money change your life right now? If yes sell, if no HODL.

@_date: 2019-06-28 18:24:43
Thanks I’ll try that and check. I was freaking out last night thinking I was gonna lose the value of what I bought sub 10k

Started buying on cashapp 2.5 weeks ago and noticed last night in my activity there’s a cash out for every btc purchase I’ve ever made under pending and if I click them they say deposits shortly and then under completed all my transactions say sale of USD for the amount I bought and card refund under that but my btc balance hasn’t changed and I’ve never tried to withdraw or sell at all is this normal data generated from purchases or should I be worried about my btc disappearing? Emailed their support but haven’t gotten any answers would appreciate feedback from you guys since it sounds like you’ve been using it for awhile now with no issues. Also have my Trezor coming today so I’m gonna try to deposit my coins to that ASAP while I still see my normal balance.
@_date: 2019-06-28 20:13:01
Just tried to withdraw to my Trezor and got confirmed in the blockchain so regardless my btc is secured!
@_date: 2019-06-27 01:16:08
I’ve been buying mine through cash app too I’ve noticed every time I buy they have the btc valued like ~$50-100 above what I see it valued as through my HODL app and my balance is always like ~$15-30 higher than what my portfolio in HODL says it should be.
@_date: 2019-06-28 09:05:53
Was nice until I realized even though I had my bank account linked every time I bought btc it was charging to my debit instead and it was fine for 2.5 weeks without any problems so I never thought to call my bank and give them a heads up about my sudden spending so my mistake but at least now I get a do over on some unfavorable buys and now once I get my money back I’ll reinvest it all at once this time at one rate. Was really regretting not buying more when it was at 8k so now I actually am hoping for more crash.

That’s my regret. Started DCAing $10 worth a day when it was at $8k and have since nutted up and a few hundred here and there when I could.
@_date: 2019-10-26 01:47:15
F. Thank you for your sacrifice

The app is called HODL I’m on iOS it’s free it shows live prices of crypto, crypto news, and let’s you make a portfolio where you can track your purchases and it’ll tell you what % of return you’ve hit

I buy my btc through cash app

Noob here just started buying in at 8k through cash app because it’s convenient. I was literally about to pull the trigger on a Trezor or Ledger does this mean I don’t need one anymore or should I still get a hardwallet?
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:18:31
I know cash app says no fees but any idea where they get their supply?

What’s your reasoning
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:25:52
Got my Trezor One coming in the post tomorrow
@_date: 2019-09-24 23:19:05
If you’re DCAing anyway coinbase has a better spread.
