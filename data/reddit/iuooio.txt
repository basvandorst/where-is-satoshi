you verify and rebroadcast transactions and new blocks (making the network faster and more secure) and you can join p2pool with your own node instead of relying on someone else's.
this is for those who keep saying they can't run full nodes because of disk space issues.
edit: also to shut up the trolls who are saying "omg there are only a few thousand bitcoin nodes".
edit: and more nodes mean more privacy because more nodes are sharing your transactions which means it is less likely that a tx originated from the IP you received it from.
edit: and people are less reliant on thin clients where the servers know which addresses are owned by whom.

thanks for the hint and for approving the comment.
imho reddit should show a warning in such a case :/

[uhm i think in the end btcisgod agreed that i was right after figuring out that he was wrong...](
as i said if you have any additional arguments post them there and if it turns out that it doesn't work I'll accept that because math can't be debated. it is either true or false.

you don't get it.
i configured the train to hit me *straight in the face at full speed* and nothing happened.
did you even look at the screenshot i posted?
it is mathematically impossible to get hit more than by doing exactly what the troll said would make bitcoin-qt crash immediately.
and - oh wonder - of course the troll was wrong. why do you think he created a fake account to spread his bullshit?
PLEASE you just can't be this stupid! math does not change its stance, no matter how much you believe!
[**but it is resolved now, look at Edit

someone suggested "crippled nodes". sounds pretty accurate, is it fine with you?

...and more from the actual OpenDiskFile function:
    if (!file) {
        LogPrintf("Unable to open file %s
", path.string());
        return NULL;
