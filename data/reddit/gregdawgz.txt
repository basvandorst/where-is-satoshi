why do you believe in bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-02-21 04:50:56
ahhh thank you for saying this.
@_date: 2014-02-17 16:43:48
disposable tattoo....boom 
@_date: 2014-01-13 15:07:03
Cool thanks man. So the live CD is just what u use to boot your system for the first time? Do you regularly use Linux for everyday use? I def want to get this setup
@_date: 2014-02-01 18:44:01
yes, and why can't it stabilize at $10kish?
@_date: 2014-01-13 04:13:12
it's more like...what if bitcoin *becomes* email.
@_date: 2014-01-14 00:55:18
thanks for the advice man...i thought it was best to store wallets on a linux system loaded on a computer that has never "touched" the internet...
are linux systems generally more secure even when connected to the net?
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:38:29
yep...i was just trying to put an order in..
@_date: 2014-01-13 14:51:31
I need to turn my old PC into a Linux machine...any good resources for getting started?
@_date: 2015-02-20 03:54:53
i like the idea, if you posted an ad on the text of the bitcoin?  be like giving your brand away i guess...forever?
@_date: 2015-02-04 22:43:21
This seems like good news...right?
@_date: 2015-02-20 03:31:44
you rock man
@_date: 2015-02-25 03:32:03
do it! buy the crash pack to get extra blades and battery...definitely need it
@_date: 2015-02-20 03:42:27
depends on how much btc i get for watching their shitty programming...or if it is good...i would be ready to collect! :)
@_date: 2015-02-24 04:42:50
yup! thats what i got:
so sweet with the camera as well, here is my first vid:
@_date: 2015-02-20 04:01:24
i may be mistaken but i thought you could embed text with btc transactions...maybe you can't put an image...just text...i may be wrong as well
@_date: 2015-02-24 01:40:07
hubsan x4
it's a micro copter...really fun tho...i have broken like 4 propellers in 2 weeks and also broke the propeller guard lol...
need to step my flying skills up
@_date: 2015-02-23 02:34:10
i just bought a quad copter the other day...so dang fun...
bitcoin can do some interesting things in the betting world
@_date: 2013-11-26 15:19:29
you still had to wait 4 days to clear didn't you?  i am hoping when demand slows (lol) i will be able to instant buy...i hope there isn't going to be a 4 day delay all the time..
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:29:55
that's a sale partly due to accepting a new cryptocurrency...sounds like a win to me.
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:47:44
this isn't fidelity 
@_date: 2013-10-15 23:22:32
"We did it we solved the debt ceiling!!".....*pats self on back* 
the can will continue to be kicked down the road for a long time...i hope i am wrong but there are a **lot** of people vested in the continuing strength of the dollar...
@_date: 2013-12-18 03:42:27
sound logic
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:19:12
ouch...the state blows
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:39:49
cool, thanks for the heads up,  i will email them right away....i need ma coins!!
@_date: 2013-03-27 03:28:41
it really is fascinating, thanks for the tips! 
@_date: 2013-03-24 20:06:01
sounds like a perfect governmental program...just keep spending tax dollars on an unsolvable problem.  i wouldn't put it past them...
@_date: 2013-11-30 04:05:00
solid take, it is awesome to feel like (for now) that i actually *own* my wealth
@_date: 2013-03-06 03:14:39
there are other ways...
@_date: 2013-11-30 04:24:16
well, for one thing, it is decentralized cryptocurrency and no one has any idea what could happen with it...maybe you can remember this comment 10 years from now and see how you feel 
@_date: 2013-03-21 03:53:24
Lol i know...its killing me
@_date: 2013-03-07 01:33:20
@_date: 2013-03-24 20:51:43
that drives me nuts when i see people do that too...lol
@_date: 2013-12-28 04:39:32
when does this happen?
@_date: 2013-03-07 00:54:39
34 now!
my bank transfer has been taking so long to clear, glad it did!!
now i just gotta see where we at when the dust settles...any chance for high 20's you think?? (i know its a crapshoot)
@_date: 2013-03-06 04:43:45
it is crazy watching at the 10min scale...i wish knew exactly what it all meant...its weird to see it bounce down and then immeadiately up to 44 and stay, then go down and up to 44 again...anyone know why this is occuring? bot of some sort?
@_date: 2013-11-30 04:13:23
what about the future sales and all you have to do is maintain your site?  your "wage" is going to increase.
@_date: 2013-03-22 18:08:42
Because they aren't the same thing....
@_date: 2013-11-26 15:40:08
i can't get my billing address to validate...keeps saying incorrect when i enter it...you have the same trouble?
@_date: 2013-03-24 18:03:38
i am curious as to where you did this as well
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:45:50
i am with you man, bought at coinbase and it isn't clearing until monday...once i get that first purchase i think it will be instantaneous...at least i hope...
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:59:55


ahha jk, ya this is a very intriguing question...one that only the free market can answer
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:53:42
i hope he accepts this
@_date: 2013-03-06 15:26:34
Cool thanks.man!
@_date: 2013-03-27 02:41:28
wait, why did it hold on $80 for so long and then break out again?....sorry noob question
@_date: 2013-05-14 23:15:16
DAS PAPIERE
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:45:13
that's pretty much guaranteed
@_date: 2013-11-25 18:32:36
that was a good read, thank you
@_date: 2013-12-03 04:25:37
"What massive online encyclopedia refused to accept the infant cryptocurrency, bitcoin, that could have set the website up for decades of prosperity?"
@_date: 2013-11-30 04:01:33
thanks for saying that, i almost went there to find out...saved me a click, thanks bra
@_date: 2013-11-20 03:59:09
why is it inflated, i was just wondering about that...which one is most reliable?
@_date: 2013-03-21 03:37:38
ya i heard they are swamped...i should get it ready so i can buy when it drops...i just don't think i can buy at this point...but i was saying that at 35....lol
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:49:06
do people think that HFT does not happen on the S&amp;P? or that it doesn't affect it?
@_date: 2013-03-21 03:07:09
i have dwolla and mt gox but haven't verified my ID to mt. gox...don't really want to submit that but i think i may have to...did you do that?
@_date: 2013-03-24 20:19:01
it is awesome to see the beauty of the freemarket at work....people are SMART! : )
@_date: 2013-03-27 04:12:16
ya i have been following closesly, waitin to dive in but was hoping for somewhat of correction...never understood the dynamics of the charts...love it!
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:24:32
glad you asked this question because i am in the same exact boat as you are...wasn't sure things were going to work after my first buy clears..(not til monday :( 
did your buy clear at the exact hour or just the day...i bought at like $520...i am hoping to get at least .5 btc by monday!! please don't break a grand yet!!
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:58:27
did you ever figure this out, i can't get it to accept my billing address either for visa card....i know i am entering the correct address...?
@_date: 2013-12-06 05:15:32
true, but those people would already be donating that many times a month...so they would just be getting it on top...i am trying to think how to use it as a marketing tool...i think a lot of people would be interested...or would start to after more exposure in the media
@_date: 2013-03-28 04:22:12
@_date: 2013-11-28 04:52:06
do you have instabuy set up on coinbase then?
i can't get my stupid billing address to connect...fml
@_date: 2013-11-26 16:10:58
so basically have to get VISA card verified in order to instantbuy?  any good recommendations for places that allow you to instantbuy relatively easy...not localbitcoins?
@_date: 2013-12-01 03:44:38
no, here:
@_date: 2013-05-21 00:17:23
interested to hear everyone's take on Wenzel's analysis...
i thought it was a good read nonetheless
@_date: 2013-12-06 05:27:17
could have been a sodium citrate reaction...can cause tingling in the body...
but yea, that sucks man
