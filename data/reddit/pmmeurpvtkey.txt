Tether is not a scam. Whales need to convert their btc into stablecoin. So they spread fud about tether and people hold btc because they are being manipulated.

You can go see the fed and tell them your strategy. It might work.

They want people to dump them to buy in cheap. Every time there is FUD, there is a pump not too far

Google do the same thing with your emails, it’s a little more elaborate tho, but the idea is there.

Look at the volume everyday. Try dumping 50000 btc.

Thing is: you are guilty by association, like how gangsterism laws works. It’s just a matter of time before everything is exposed. I expect your comment to be deleted when it happen.

I used to like Ver, it went down the drain when he tried to profit from his image to mislead less tech savvy people to go for his bcash abomination.
If you want me to use rhetoric and sophisms, I can. Ver is a toxic individual, Wright is a compulsive liar. I can debate if needed, that they are both pieces of shit and harmed btc.
@_date: 2019-09-16 06:10:17
You mean Craig Wright??
@_date: 2019-09-20 13:56:35
I have learned that when there is suddenly a lot of post about buying, that means it’s gonna go down.

The comments here were expected. W/e your take on taxes: if you make money, you owe taxes. You can do finance optimization, it’s all good. The line is crossed when you do something illegal.
This might jeopardize the IPO...
