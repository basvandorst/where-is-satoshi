Let's just say it's one light second. That's universal the same no matter how backwards you are :)

Yeah. Problem is, there are already dozens of coins that are faster and have lower fees. Per your analogy that's like using a 56K modern when there's already DSL available.

The same as for Subversion versus Git: Decentralization -&gt; No single point of failure.

Ah, is this why on kraken it's XBT instead of BTC?
@_date: 2017-08-10 00:45:09
No, is currency.
@_date: 2017-08-07 20:47:42
Because this way I gain 10 - 30 % per month in the altcoin, while still having the same amount of btc.
And because Holding is boring.

Oh, yes they have. When even the mainstream media writes about BCH even my mom notices.

I don't really understand how a cryptocurrency can be over- or undervalued. I understand it for stocks. But for crypto, where the only value is what someone is willing to pay for it. It's always right valued, because the only value comes from the market.

Keep one printout in a safe location. Keep another as an encrypted, Password protected PDF (or png, or whatever) in the cloud.
What you don't want is a single point of failure. like an exchange.

I think it will be 0. We're still at the start of all this. In 2050 we will think of bitcoin like we think of AOL, Compuserve, Altavista or MySpace today.
Even if it is one million. If the world keeps printing Fiat as it does now, one million will be worth near to nothing by then.

Here's mine: I take a coin I believe in. I trade it agains BTC.
I just trade back and forth. If the altcoin rises, I sell if for btc. If it dips, I buy it with btc. I always use 50 % of my holdings in the altcoin for this. Just in case it shoots way up, so I still have the gains of the other 50 %
I the end, I don't care which of the two I'm holding, I believe in both.

I have no problem when law enforement can see my transactions, if they have a warrant.
I have a problem though, when everyone can see my transactions. Or how much money I have in my wallet.

The TenX wallet uses an address that begins with 3. If this means SegWit, there's another one for your list.

Or give the poeple a chance to sell their coins as long as they still can.

Search on reddit. i seem to remember that there was something not too long ago.
If I remeber right, the answer to your question is, yes, they move your funds. To a cold storage. Safety reasons.

I don't get it. What's the problem with 2 MB vs 1 MB blocksize? Even my phone has 3 GB RAM nowadays. Which computer that isn't from 1995 has a problem with 2 MB blocks?
Are people running Full Nodes on their smartwatches or something?
