not if you're bill gates or mark zuckerberg.

What if the criminal follows you at home and maintain control over you physically and threat to kill your family until you give away the private keys?
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:26:54
same thing, if you forgot the 1/2 ,bank blows up, you loose your money, if you remember both, guy puts a gun on your head and threat to kill your son or daughter, you give your private keys, you loose your money.

why are you mad at me, dude I love cryptocurrency. I am here to find a solution. ok lets take a look, point a gun and withdraw from atm : many atms have cctv, security and fixed location for you to be aware of. the money can be traced with it's serial number printed. Atms limit withdrawal per day. Sound good right? This is fiat money, with bitcoin you just need a private key and poof, everything is gone. How do we solve this?

can't bring big guns everywhere every time

mobile banking? send money from your account to criminal account?? read the comments bellow.
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:22:24
so instead of wanting to be free from the government, now you have to be afraid from everyone? Some public figures just want to live a normal life without bodyguards following them around.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:00:54
kidnap your child and asked you for money, if its fiat and from the bank then the money can be traced by its serial number. Plus most gov have reserve money to help victims with these situations so you wont have to give the criminals your own money.
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:39:36
The problem : Your cryptocurrency can be taken by anyone who has control over you physically. Example: Criminal pointing a gun on your head asking for your private keys. This is a problem. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:04:48
there must be a mechanism to secure your private keys when you encounter these types if situations. If Bitcoin can  solve this problem, It would be the best store of value in history.
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:14:31
interesting point, but what if the banks run away? what if there is a terrorist attack and blow up your hardware wallet? These situations also can happen to normal banks but at least they can print new money and give you a refund. Of course printing money is bad, but we're talking about the security of your money and being able to get it back. Right now, paper money is way better choise than cryptocurrency because of this. But what if we can solve this.
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:08:37
that would make things harder for the criminals but not as hard as stealing money from your bank
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:07:06
don't play games with scams. just buy and hold
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:09:55
Sorry, I'm not a blockchain expert but do you really need to code an entire blockchain protocol to test different algorithm such as sha256 with equihash etc etc

best bitcoin speaker i've ever saw
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:51:03
Hi Satoshi, do you really really think bitcoin is decentralized? How do we clean up the shit that we have done?
@_date: 2018-05-28 14:23:47
Wall Street down - crypto down

What's Apple without IBM?
@_date: 2018-05-05 00:32:05
sounds more like Monero 
@_date: 2017-03-27 07:10:59
wow thankfully it didn't happen
@_date: 2017-03-17 10:15:02
Why not?
@_date: 2017-04-25 13:45:31
it's possible but hard and waste a lot of time. just try localbitcoins
@_date: 2017-04-28 07:42:40
this is bad, looks like someone is trying to hack
@_date: 2017-04-13 23:46:18
damn i hope it does, i wanna buy more
@_date: 2017-04-26 13:38:02
i suggest for you to hold
@_date: 2017-04-17 03:01:29
@_date: 2017-04-16 07:14:18
try poloniex
@_date: 2017-04-15 01:53:25
it needs 2 weeks for activation. thats the rule
@_date: 2017-04-25 13:37:47
try local bitcoins 
@_date: 2017-04-27 16:53:13
Litening network!!!
@_date: 2017-04-25 11:55:09
try luno app, get registered and transfer it straight to your bank account 
@_date: 2017-04-26 22:47:08
true, but lessons need to be learned. let the market decide
@_date: 2017-04-09 23:38:52
Last year bitfinex became the second Mtgox. This year they paid everyone's money back! I don't use bitfinex but give them upmost respect for paying back! Hats off to bitfinex!

gotta be Malaysians
@_date: 2017-04-07 00:42:04
its much more complicated than that, the first question is will there be buyers for you to liquidate your coins into profit? If not, then the price will go back down. You need to have large market volume to do a pump. Other wise people will know that the price increase is just numbers. Just sharing for knowledge, pump and dump is criminal activity.  You're basically robbing other people's money by taking away their value from the coin or commodity. Banks do that all the time by printing money and taking out the value out of your paper money. Nobody's perfect but I think we should all stay away from pump and dump activity. It's better to buy and hold and only cash out when you need the money. It's simple and everyone will prosper.
@_date: 2017-04-26 01:41:30
go to coinbase and buy
@_date: 2017-04-26 01:02:47
because bitfinex price is in usd tether. 1 tether equals to around usd 0.90 cents
@_date: 2017-05-10 07:14:53
download jaxx wallet and convert your btc to ltc inside the wallet
@_date: 2017-05-04 14:20:24
3k end of this year!
@_date: 2017-05-09 02:26:11
bad block timing meaning congestions on the network?
@_date: 2017-05-09 02:31:24
so it's not a problem right? I just wait now? sorry for asking a lot of questions, I'm just scared.
@_date: 2017-05-09 02:57:14
thanks �� it's already confirmed! I feel like you just saved my life! plus while waiting I learned a lot about bitcoin tx processing from you and wikipedia :)
@_date: 2017-05-09 02:03:46
It's been an hour for the medium fee tx and 30 minutes for the high fee tx on jaxx. Is this normal? I'm starting to sweat a little.
@_date: 2017-05-09 02:57:34
thanks �� 
@_date: 2017-05-03 23:42:49
you get 15% discount on EVERYTHING on Amazon.com using bitcoin through purse.io
@_date: 2017-05-10 07:00:57
Nope, but let me give you one advise that I wish someone told me a year ago. "Buy and Hold Bitcoin" Don't sell until you really really need the money.
@_date: 2017-05-13 17:28:28
any transaction id?
@_date: 2017-05-06 11:55:34
same here
@_date: 2017-05-04 02:39:32
i hope it does, i need to buy more
@_date: 2017-05-02 00:45:36
10 years maybe, but the tech must evolve. if not... hhmm i don't think so 
@_date: 2017-05-25 08:51:23
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:35:38
what I meant was the tech, mass "Bank" adoption is centralization. Plus banks don't buy these coins from exchanges, they buy directly from ripple creator
@_date: 2017-05-10 07:12:33
coinbase, but it depends on your country. I live in Malaysia, I use Luno
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:30:44
ya, i wonder?
@_date: 2017-05-09 02:12:12
2 transactions, both is 1 btc each. one is set medium fee and one is set high fee on jaxx
@_date: 2017-05-02 00:51:21

@_date: 2017-05-10 08:46:45
Can't wait to try the lightning network!
@_date: 2017-05-09 06:04:03
well, i just don't know what to say.. brave..
@_date: 2017-05-08 04:26:56
@_date: 2017-05-09 01:39:23
thanks for the info, appreciate it �� 
@_date: 2017-05-09 02:16:48
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:51:40
Hard to say cause it might keep pumping but who knows 
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:28:52
centralized, little news, little update and nothing special about the coin.  It's very suspicious �� 
@_date: 2017-05-10 05:17:24
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:35:46
@_date: 2017-05-06 11:43:37
good point ☝️ 
@_date: 2017-05-09 21:47:43
or... use litecoin ;)
@_date: 2017-06-17 12:46:39
obviously a scam
