Hehe could be. . . I'm curious how many people are using it. One thing I like about Coinbase is they let you know all the time how many wallets have been made.
@_date: 2014-08-23 15:06:59
No I'm not. heheh You can try it yourself and see how things are.

The nice thing is the house doesn't get the money with bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-08-23 18:04:57
That's what I do, every time!
@_date: 2014-08-23 13:18:25
I have a coinbase account that I use as well. . and I don't want them to cancel it as some kind of revenge for comparing coinbase somewhat negatively to circle.
@_date: 2014-08-23 18:07:37
No, I'm not an employee just a jazzed user.
@_date: 2014-08-23 18:06:36
I have some instant buying on coinbase but still it takes ages for the money to be taken out or deposited in my credit union account.
@_date: 2014-08-23 18:25:50
I agree but I don't want to chance it. . . . I like having accounts in both in case one goes belly up (and I don't use either to store bitcoin at all).
@_date: 2014-08-23 18:05:54
Tell me about it. . . I was waiting pretty impatiently as well.
@_date: 2014-08-24 07:01:21
I"m not sure what they do because often the rate is better than Coinbase one (both on buying and selling). . . and heaps better when you consider coinbase fees.
@_date: 2014-08-24 07:00:32
Yes. . . well hopefully it will force coinbase to provide better service. . . and they'll both compete tremendously with each other instead of giving up. I hate monopolies of any kind.

Just use it to interface with the legacy systems. Hopefully in a few years we can all get payed in bitcoin and do our shopping in bitcoin and we can say byebye to any dealings with fiat.
@_date: 2014-08-23 18:06:50
Yes, I feel the more competition the better!
@_date: 2014-08-23 19:06:46
No (if Coinbase pushes the transaction right away, which sometimes they don't). But bitcoins do travel faster from your wallet to circle because they only need four confirmations.
@_date: 2014-08-23 13:38:11
Yeah, I don't know. . . they've cancelled a lot of people's accounts for gambling or selling a few bitcoins on local bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-08-23 19:07:12
As soon as you buy bitcoin, send it to your own blockchain wallet or cold paper wallet!
@_date: 2014-08-23 15:20:20
Mix your coins and you should be fine. (That's what I'll probably end up doing with most of my coins)
@_date: 2014-08-24 06:59:32
Yes, so you have to mix your bitcoin and don't store any of your bitcoin in coinbase or circle.
@_date: 2014-08-23 13:43:26
Yes, I keep 98% of my money on paper wallets. . . and then use circle and coinbase mainly as ways to interact with the legacy system . . . and  mainly use blockchain.info for my spending.
