I would recommend the book The Bitcoin Standard.
@_date: 2018-09-04 21:50:22
Damn can't believe I did that.
@_date: 2018-09-05 02:34:35
I know I fucked up. I was in a rush
@_date: 2018-09-06 16:09:40
So it should have been their
@_date: 2018-09-05 16:21:07
Goes to show you they're price indicators are probably worthless
@_date: 2018-09-01 20:09:43
Lol that's probably true in some cases. I was talking about hacking though. Yer funny
@_date: 2018-09-01 20:12:09
Very funny
@_date: 2018-09-06 16:07:15
No shit lol
@_date: 2018-09-01 20:07:39
With out hodlers bitcoin wouldn't be where it is today. You can believe that!
@_date: 2018-09-05 22:40:18
I can't get those things right to save my ass.
@_date: 2018-09-06 22:38:59
Yea I'm still waiting to hear back from their support 2 weeks
@_date: 2018-09-03 10:46:50
Yes continue. Must keep track of this whale. If he sells all these bitcoin could effect price of whole market.
@_date: 2018-09-01 20:49:11
My mobile wallets have randomized number key board
@_date: 2018-09-05 16:18:47
Educated guessing
@_date: 2018-09-05 22:46:58
2024 I can't wait that damn long!!
@_date: 2018-09-06 16:08:40
Fuck those price indicators. I'm holding no matter what.
@_date: 2018-09-05 22:43:31
Goes to show their price indicators are worthless.. Is that better. Lol ��
@_date: 2018-09-01 20:46:42
What about a randomized number board
@_date: 2018-09-02 23:45:46
@_date: 2018-09-01 16:31:00
I think it will be the next gold. Governments around the world will use it to back up they're fiat currencies in they're central banks.
@_date: 2018-09-01 17:47:10
So you should have a good password or pin

I guess it takes some time

You always get a tax break when your money goes in an IRA
@_date: 2018-08-10 22:40:37
Are the lightening payments harder to track. You would have to have a lighting wallet.
@_date: 2018-08-04 01:33:48
Yea but usually news like that whould drive up price. Guess whales are keeping the price down.
@_date: 2018-08-17 18:52:31
@_date: 2018-08-04 00:08:03
Why hasn't this drove the price up more?
@_date: 2018-08-06 01:36:53
Does anyone feel this will be good for bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-08-21 02:15:05
That's awesome! I also do weekly buys $25 every week
@_date: 2018-08-07 00:07:45
@_date: 2018-08-10 16:09:58
How bout if a ETF is approved
@_date: 2018-08-06 02:14:46
Ok sorry bout that guess I forgot
@_date: 2018-08-19 22:00:17
And these transactions will be off the blockchain?
@_date: 2018-08-18 14:47:05
Ain't done nothing for the price. Price can't ever seem to break over 6700 since it collapsed from 8500
@_date: 2018-08-13 23:03:49
I already buy $25 every week and $50 every 2 weeks. Got about 6 grand in and I ain't selling. I don't care if go above $10,000
@_date: 2018-08-18 22:23:13
Ain't that what a ETF does?
@_date: 2018-08-10 13:20:11
They said they have ways to track that also.
@_date: 2018-08-19 02:19:37
Seriously though they are kind of hard to figure out.
@_date: 2018-08-29 15:53:51
Your crazy if you think bitcoin gonna stay at this price. It will be well over $10,000  by the end of this year. You can bank on that.
@_date: 2018-08-11 10:04:55
Yea forgot to add that part
@_date: 2018-08-18 15:05:53
Yea went from 100k to 50k to 25k now to 10k. Goes to show you their as clueless about what the price will do just as much as we are.
@_date: 2018-08-08 15:21:47
Sure hasn't been so far. All rejected.
@_date: 2018-08-17 00:09:42
Price is already manipulated ETF will help with that if anything
@_date: 2018-08-04 20:53:42
Wouldn't this new stock exchange  bring stability ?
@_date: 2018-08-17 15:55:57
Damn why do I keep doing That? I know it must be as annoying  as he'll. Lol
@_date: 2018-08-14 16:09:07
I'm gonna hodl. I don't care if it goes past 10000 I'm still gonna hodl.
@_date: 2018-08-05 08:56:23
It's the whales manipulating the price selling like crazy right now to drive down price. Then when sufiiently low enough for there liking they will start buying like crazy. That's when the bull run will happen. So you better start buying now at the low price.
@_date: 2018-08-05 00:46:42
I hope your right.
@_date: 2018-08-19 01:31:25
So what your saying.is they're trend analysis ain't worth the paper it's written on ,that you should use for toilet paper to wipe your ass with,. Lol��
@_date: 2018-08-10 09:30:20
Never store you keys on your computer I guess
@_date: 2018-08-13 15:57:57
That's right it's note encrypted on the exit node
@_date: 2018-08-09 16:12:10
Rtf is inevitable for bitcoin. You won't be complaining when it jumps to the moon
@_date: 2018-08-19 01:59:23
So what your saying is these dune coons diplomas ain't worth the paper their written on. Lol just kidding ������
@_date: 2018-08-12 02:40:51
How can anyone figure out your identity from the blockchain if your using tor or a vpn to send your transactions through. As long as your ip address is kept hidden I don't see how it could be done.
@_date: 2018-08-24 00:34:55
Sounds bullshit bitcoin analysis.  Those fuckers are hardly ever right maybe 1 out 20.
@_date: 2018-08-19 01:42:25
So what your saying is that this is probably not possible and these asswipes with they're trend charts and technical analysis bullshit don't know what the fuck their talking about. Lol������
@_date: 2018-08-17 16:04:01
I don't know. I guess cause some people do. Maybe it will keep them from panic selling and losing they're  money.
@_date: 2018-08-07 10:45:55
Yea I agree. There a big decision coming up in USA on a ETF this friday. If gets approved should send bitcoin price very high. I hope.
@_date: 2018-08-17 10:42:26
That's what I thought
@_date: 2018-08-04 19:42:04
Your could have put the link to the website. Instead of taking a picture of the newspaper. Lol
@_date: 2018-08-29 01:01:27
I'm guessing you don't like Bank of America. I didn't hear about that stuff is that fact or conspiracy theories.
@_date: 2018-08-11 15:20:41
That's what I been doing
@_date: 2018-08-19 02:29:34
That's what I do 25 every week
@_date: 2018-08-04 21:50:42
Damn rich people control everything. BITCOIN is suppose to be the people's money.
@_date: 2018-08-10 22:41:54
Lightening payments are not traceable on the blockchain?
@_date: 2018-08-09 01:09:37
It's sure does
@_date: 2018-08-29 03:04:08
@_date: 2018-08-06 00:49:43
Is regulation good for bitcoin or bad? Tell me what you think
@_date: 2018-08-05 12:39:04
Here is the link: 
@_date: 2018-08-12 17:42:35
Yea not if people don't buy and hodl the price will not rise in value. This is the reason we are in a bear market. People buying and panic selling over the least little thing. Bitcoin is better as a store of value then a currency.
@_date: 2018-08-20 23:28:55
Did you ever have a chance to make a huge profit if you sold in those 5 years?
@_date: 2018-08-13 13:24:42
I mean ip
@_date: 2018-08-10 13:22:27
How are exchange traded funds off topic
@_date: 2018-08-13 16:05:18
I thought the lightening solved this problem about slow transactions?
@_date: 2018-08-10 09:46:28
Didn't they catch the guy who ran silk road with it, or was it from his own dumb mistakes?
@_date: 2018-08-11 20:19:29
I think it's already seen it's low 6000 to 6100. I believe better load up now. From here I think will be a steady rise until ETFs decision comes up. If approved the moon's the limit. If rejected hold on for the rollercoaster ride down. Whatever that's worth now that I said that the opposite will happen.
P 
@_date: 2018-08-04 00:15:11
Why isn't this news driving the price up yet?
@_date: 2018-08-04 01:48:46
If they get a ETF approved in  September might be $20,000 by the end of the year.
@_date: 2018-08-06 23:21:36
BAKKA damn spell check spelled it wrong
@_date: 2018-08-19 18:55:01
Don't a lot of them go to universities in America?
@_date: 2018-08-11 16:52:20
I think now is a good time to buy. Wish I had money to buy more. You know the price will eventually go much higher then 6100.
@_date: 2018-08-16 00:08:52
Yea that don't surprise me. I guess some people believe in it. Maybe it will stop people from panic selling there bitcoin and losing a lot of money. All they need to do is be patient and not do anything irrational.
@_date: 2018-08-18 15:11:04
15,000 according to article
@_date: 2018-08-06 01:01:15
Yea I guess I did. Lol I
@_date: 2018-08-18 15:09:01
Wipe my ass with these predictions, their about as worthless as the toilet paper you wipe your ass with. I do hope he guessed right though 
@_date: 2018-08-14 01:24:06
Get yourself  a bitcoin wallet transfer the bitcoin to it and use that wallet to pay for it.
@_date: 2018-08-18 15:42:11
Good strategy that what I do buy $25 per week in btc.
@_date: 2018-08-18 22:22:12
Believe me all those middle East countries have fucked up governments. Most of them worse then India.
@_date: 2018-08-29 00:56:49
The same bank of America that denied the use of they're credit cards for bitcoin purchases.
@_date: 2018-08-14 16:03:06
Because it will bring new investers into bitcoin
@_date: 2018-08-10 01:54:35
It doesn't say what you spent your bitcoin on in the blockchain. So how would they know what you spent it on?
@_date: 2018-08-14 01:54:45
Lol do it.. every body should do it. What's $5 most people could afford it.
@_date: 2018-08-18 15:03:13
Hope he's right. That would be a nice Christmas  present.
@_date: 2018-08-19 02:55:42
wmy do they write this stuff if it's not possible?
@_date: 2018-08-19 13:14:19
Yea probably right. They will get more user friendly with time
@_date: 2018-08-06 01:37:29
Damn forgot the y
@_date: 2018-08-19 02:09:50
Don't believe that chart analysis bullshit. They have chart analysis that say the exact opposite too. Bitcoin has already seen it's bottom at 5800. In my humble opinion.
@_date: 2018-08-20 00:59:21
Where can you can the audible version of the book. I have the book had to skip through the early chapters on the history of money. Those chapters pretty  boring. Overall excellent book.
@_date: 2018-08-08 01:41:25
Need to get some regulation or the whales will always manipulate the price. The little investet will be at there mercy.
@_date: 2018-08-19 22:18:41
Wow that's some far out shit. I think he's on acid. Lol������
@_date: 2018-09-01 20:11:25
Lmao your a funny guy
@_date: 2018-08-29 19:27:37
You know what I mean problem with how long it's taking
@_date: 2018-08-08 15:38:27
Yea your right.
@_date: 2018-08-19 22:25:10
Good article definitely agree with what he said.
@_date: 2018-08-05 02:49:24
I hope so if not this week it will be soon it's coming for sure.
@_date: 2018-08-08 16:29:40
People that probably know more about it then I do.
@_date: 2018-08-14 16:05:53
That's the problem to many panic sellers. Be patient bitcoin will go up again 
@_date: 2018-08-10 22:32:58
Yea he made a mistake. That's what I figured.
@_date: 2018-08-10 09:32:08
Must be a lot more to it that they ain't talking about
@_date: 2018-08-11 20:10:12
You'll be hold long time cause I don't think you will ever see the price that low again.
@_date: 2018-08-20 09:58:19
Yea your right I guess when I say they I'm talking about anybody with the coding skills that can make it happen. Since I have no coding skills and do not have the money to hire anyone with coding skills. So for this reason I am not part of the they that could make it happen.
@_date: 2018-08-09 02:18:57
Hey that's what I say why not. Can only be a good thing for bitcoin owners.
@_date: 2018-08-23 18:47:40
Yea I agree
@_date: 2018-08-15 15:48:05
Point well taken.
@_date: 2018-08-08 16:23:06
I agree with everything you said but why doesn't the opposite happen with good news, God knows there has been plenty of it lately.
@_date: 2018-08-04 21:38:05
They sure ain't right now. I meant over the short term like the last week. You knew what I meant.
@_date: 2018-08-09 02:03:34
@_date: 2018-08-12 21:57:20
Yep first ETF was 2003: 
@_date: 2018-08-18 22:26:21
Damn did it again. Guess I been out of school to long. I know I had a couple I got it right on. Lol
@_date: 2018-08-19 02:28:32
Buy buy buy price is great deal where it's at!
@_date: 2018-08-30 01:34:03
Yea that's what I don't understand why it took so long hour 45min. I didn't have my wallet set to the lowest fee. It was some where in the middle..
@_date: 2018-08-11 20:26:34
Maybe but I think it's seen it's low around 6000 to 6100.
@_date: 2018-08-13 09:21:36
It's the fundamental way bitcoin is set up to work.
@_date: 2018-08-10 23:33:36
Wish they would hurry up so we could see a break in this bear market.
@_date: 2018-08-18 22:19:40
Damn really? Wouldn't they get exposed when they started working for the tech company?
@_date: 2018-08-07 00:06:14
Thanks for the input your probably right.
@_date: 2018-08-29 15:45:23
That's when Bakkt goes online. Then bitcoin will get a massive influx of new money from institutional investors. Which should make the price go up substantially.
@_date: 2018-08-19 12:57:48
@_date: 2018-08-10 08:55:20
They say they can track Monero and cash to
@_date: 2018-08-19 01:35:19
Oh I see thanks for explaining that. I don't really know a whole lot about either one of them.
@_date: 2018-08-11 16:55:50
That article is old. I guess I should have looked at the date. I'm so stupid
@_date: 2018-08-19 15:47:37
Does it have mobile version?
@_date: 2018-08-12 21:35:04
I beg to differ ETFs did a lot for gold prices went from $400 an once to $1800 an ounce in about 6 years
@_date: 2018-08-08 20:17:53
Wish that would happen here minus the hyperinflation. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 10:00:50
Why is it snarky
@_date: 2018-08-04 00:56:00
Wonder why?
@_date: 2018-08-29 22:10:11
That's the longest I ever had to wait. Usually don't take that long
@_date: 2018-08-10 22:31:32
Probably but you would have to be an important high value target to have the NSA on your back.
@_date: 2018-08-24 16:03:23
I thought they reviewed them already and rejected them again
@_date: 2018-08-30 13:25:25
I'm telling ya. Lol
@_date: 2018-08-13 15:58:43
Not encrypted I meant
@_date: 2018-08-14 16:01:06
Wish it was easier to figure out how to use the damn thing
@_date: 2018-08-12 13:06:53
Damn fucked up again!
@_date: 2018-08-18 14:44:11
You would think of any country they would have the best understanding of how the technology works. So many tech savvy experts come from their and work in Silicon valley with the big tech companies.
@_date: 2018-08-04 14:27:21
That should be the reverse. You should want to buy when prices are low
@_date: 2018-08-18 22:28:47
Yea what he said. Not to much different then 401k don't you got one their you work?
@_date: 2018-08-11 17:00:55
your absolutely right. That's what I plan on doing holding. One thing is for sure it will eventually go back up. It just a matter of when.
@_date: 2018-08-20 22:55:39
That's awsome
@_date: 2018-08-19 02:35:44
Good read. Want to know what market gonna do, watch a whale.
@_date: 2018-08-09 16:12:32
@_date: 2018-08-13 00:20:52
@_date: 2018-08-10 09:40:14
They catch them because of mistakes the criminals  make along the way that causes them to not be anonymous anymore
@_date: 2018-08-04 00:57:13
Maybe people are taking a wait and see approach 
@_date: 2018-08-15 17:38:57
Best advice stay patient. It's been a roller coaster ride but hold your bitcoin and it will payoff handsomely it the longrun.
@_date: 2018-08-29 15:39:03
Good advice
@_date: 2018-08-29 19:26:12
Mine took 1 hour 45 min.
@_date: 2018-08-19 22:04:19
Bet you wish you had that 20 bitcoin now.
@_date: 2018-08-04 00:27:45
Why isn't this news driving up the price yet?
@_date: 2018-08-12 01:03:45
Your right my bad
@_date: 2018-08-06 01:02:24
The worst price drop I guess
@_date: 2018-08-14 09:57:30
Good point
@_date: 2018-08-11 20:11:44
Tell me when gets to 10,000 that's when I might sell some
@_date: 2018-08-23 23:57:33
That's right bitcoin is met to be decentralized there will always be susceptible to price manipulation. It was made to be a decentralized currency...
@_date: 2018-08-29 15:31:05
Really I didn't even think to look at date. That app shouldn't be given old news.
@_date: 2018-08-24 00:25:02
But will they be able to ease the SEC concerns about price manipulation
@_date: 2018-08-19 23:33:17
No shit but if they didn't know what their doing the companies they work for would fire them. Right?
@_date: 2018-08-18 15:57:40
Just a break above 6700 would be nice. Then we might be able to break over 7000
@_date: 2018-08-29 22:08:31
Yea I know that will speed it up. I didn't have it set on the lowest though.
@_date: 2018-08-19 18:55:52
Ok thanks
@_date: 2018-08-13 16:05:47
Lightening network
@_date: 2018-08-06 01:28:18
Yea that title is pretty misleading 
@_date: 2018-08-04 00:33:56
How long will it take for this news to start affecting the price of bitcoin to the BULLISH side?
@_date: 2018-08-14 00:49:52
That's a good idea if every did that it boost up the market. BITCOIN needs an influx of new money. People got to stop panic selling. It's should be a long term investment. Buy and hodl. You won't be sorry.
@_date: 2018-08-15 15:55:15
Yep if we hold on. We will make out fine.
@_date: 2018-08-19 13:10:48
Good reply. That stuff could very well be around the corner. I think the housing wasn't so much about the prices as it was about the banks given loans and mortgages to people that should never have been approved for them. So when you have so many people defaulting on mortgages you have a housing crises. We are ripe for another one. Do to the fact that the current President  in undoing the regulations that were put in place by the previous administration  to keep this sort of thing from happening again.
@_date: 2018-08-04 20:50:14
Yea you probably  right never thought about it like that
@_date: 2018-08-23 18:49:37
Yea true. I wonder how price will react if the one next month gets rejected. That's the one that should be appoved
@_date: 2018-08-05 02:49:08
I hope so if not this week it will be soon it's coming for sure
@_date: 2018-08-19 01:45:42
The other people commenting on this article said these jerk offs don't know what the fuck they're talking about.
@_date: 2018-08-06 13:25:46
Yea that's true
@_date: 2018-08-29 18:19:58
Has anyone else noticed this problem?
@_date: 2018-08-06 13:25:13
Yea I know
@_date: 2018-08-10 22:28:56
Yea mostly the dumb ones who get caught.

BULLISH people need to stop panic selling.
@_date: 2018-08-13 13:24:04
But how can they tell who you are if your up hidden with tor or vpn
@_date: 2018-08-10 10:10:16
ETF I meant
@_date: 2018-08-20 23:30:12
They only lost money if they panicked and sold.
@_date: 2018-08-08 15:35:06
Yea the ones for this year delayed but I'm talking about the ones from last year that got rejected.
@_date: 2018-08-21 02:15:55
I been doing weekly buys for about a year now
@_date: 2018-08-12 21:59:11

@_date: 2018-08-17 13:26:18
Say it enough  times your bound to be right one time.
@_date: 2018-08-19 02:42:42
mostly because of new U.S. sanctions.
@_date: 2018-08-10 01:45:23
Good post. Some great advice.
@_date: 2018-08-08 20:57:21
Gotta hold now or loose bundle of money
@_date: 2018-08-10 01:40:03
Yea that's what I thought. And if you do have bitcoin from an exchange better wash it with some bitcoin tumbler service.
@_date: 2018-08-07 13:19:56
But I'd like make money on my investment. I kinda bought at bad time price was 8000. Then went down to 6800
@_date: 2018-08-19 02:13:08
Yea predictions are like assholes and balmovements. Everybody has one lol������
@_date: 2018-08-11 23:51:18
How can the cops find your identity on the blockchain if your transactions are done through tor or a vpn. The only way is if your ip address is not hidden.
@_date: 2018-08-14 01:21:21
Yea I have the atom wallet on my tablet I can't figure it out either. 
@_date: 2018-08-17 16:10:29
Lmao that's how I feel to.
@_date: 2018-08-08 16:28:39
No it's not.just wanted to get other people opinion on it.
@_date: 2018-08-29 18:21:45
Increased my fee and got first confirmation.
@_date: 2018-08-15 02:57:44
Watch the whales and go along for the ride. Buy as much as you can afford now at these low prices. We all should be paid handsomely in the long run.
@_date: 2018-08-11 20:27:17
Have to do some whale watching.
@_date: 2018-08-08 15:37:30
Lol that's wishful thinking. 15,000 I'd be happy
@_date: 2018-08-19 12:55:53
How do you open a channal
@_date: 2018-08-19 22:28:32
No defiantly not keep it. You'll be glad you did 3 to 5 years from now when it's worth 20 to 50k per bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-04 20:51:22
Yea if new that we'd  all be rich
@_date: 2018-08-15 15:53:20
Yea you make a good point. Probably worthless info. Lol I don't go by it I'm a long term investor. I just figured somebody would read it and stop panic selling their bitcoin and losing money.
@_date: 2018-08-13 13:24:28
I mean ip
@_date: 2018-08-04 01:58:26
What the hell is a moonboy?
@_date: 2018-06-23 13:44:50
Over 100
@_date: 2018-06-24 11:46:24
Ok brother thanks for checking it out for me
@_date: 2018-06-23 14:29:42
I know but I have used this mixer before with no problems.
@_date: 2018-06-23 23:25:20
Oh shit really?
@_date: 2018-06-24 12:36:31
I think I was duped by a phishing site
@_date: 2018-06-23 02:32:40
They made it look on the blockchain like the money was sent back to my 3. Wallets. But it weren't cause I got a big fat goose egg for my balance! Those assholes.
@_date: 2018-06-23 23:24:22
I think that was the mixers address where the coins were to be mixed and sent back to me in 3 different wallets.
@_date: 2018-06-23 20:04:33
Maybe I don't understand it right.
@_date: 2018-06-23 01:55:46
Ok thanks for the comments  guess I won't be using dream market btc mixer. I'll just buy them from local. Bitcoin. I can't believe it cause I had used there mixer several times before.
@_date: 2018-06-24 11:53:30
Looks like somebody spent it all today.
@_date: 2018-06-23 22:58:55
Sorry that wasn't it here it is: 3c90be523340b5301912e9b83adb7bea13de92fd7ac85fe51c631964431ecb33
@_date: 2018-06-24 11:51:09
I'll have to check it out. It was suppose to come back to 3 different wallets. Man I really apreiciat you checking it out for me.
@_date: 2018-06-23 23:27:01
Should I get a new wallet?
@_date: 2018-06-23 14:28:01
Yea I know not to good on my grammer.
@_date: 2018-06-23 13:38:49
I'm trying to figure out what happened to my $350 of btc that went through btc mixer I never got back.
@_date: 2018-06-23 14:49:20
I did but it looks like they sent it to 3 wallet addresses. That what I set it to do but it's not in any of the 3 wallets which is not possible so I thought maybe I didn't understand it.
@_date: 2018-06-23 13:36:43
Maybe I just don't understand how to read it.
@_date: 2018-06-23 14:51:30
I thought maybe someone with better understanding of how btc works should check it out.
@_date: 2018-06-23 23:01:29
Thanks in advance if you feel like checking
@_date: 2018-06-23 22:37:12
I'll give you the transaction I'd 582ff4ff697b9ea0bf1fdeac96e66a08ad19a5e6b255fae915e5abad1b50a7bc
@_date: 2018-06-23 14:26:34
Yes they provided a transaction I'd. It looked to me like they they sent it to my wallets but I don't have it in there. I have used this mixer before with no problems. If I give you the transaction number could you check it for me?
@_date: 2018-06-23 22:53:07
Let me double check
@_date: 2018-06-23 20:01:49
3c90be523340b5301912e9b83adb7bea13de92fd7ac85fe51c631964431ecb33 is the transaction id.
@_date: 2018-06-23 02:27:15
I sure will give me a second  this is the address 
@_date: 2018-07-29 02:32:26
You got to sell them sooner or later.
@_date: 2018-07-29 06:33:37
I think it has something to do with gambling site. No wonder he says 50000 he is a gambler.
@_date: 2018-07-29 06:29:21
Why do you even buy them if your gonna buy them and die with them, that's stupid unless your planning to leave them with your kids
@_date: 2018-07-28 02:47:39
Yea the price will skyrocket to maybe $50,000 by the end of year if ones approved
@_date: 2018-07-31 18:13:47
Yea he should get a new trial if they dropped the murder for hire charge. Why should he serve life without parole for running a darkmarket
@_date: 2018-07-04 23:02:15
Ok I'll keep that in mind for next time
@_date: 2018-07-26 22:47:42
What's the chances of one of these ETFs getting approved?
@_date: 2018-07-28 02:42:58
But won't the ETF give the protection to the investor the sec is looking for?
@_date: 2018-07-29 03:07:26
You can't take these bitcoin to the grave with you. The whole idea is to buy low sell high. How long your willing to wait is the question.
@_date: 2018-07-28 02:45:05
I believe the one coming in September will be approved
@_date: 2018-07-29 10:59:35
Yep I think it was
@_date: 2018-07-29 15:34:02
It is best to hold on to it. But since you can't spend it on a lot of everyday items maybe would be best to sell at your high point. I think it was meant to be more of a commodity then a currency.
@_date: 2018-07-04 23:00:27
@_date: 2018-07-29 03:03:47
Has anyone sold there bitcoins on bitquik? I want to know what they think about it.
@_date: 2018-07-04 01:41:18
damn wonder why mine took so long?
@_date: 2018-07-27 01:13:20
What's the chances of one of these ETFs getting approved?
@_date: 2018-07-07 20:17:26
Today I used the same fee only took 20min
@_date: 2018-07-04 00:34:16
Confirmations just came through took 1hour 5 min
@_date: 2018-07-31 19:30:56
Yea mainly due to the unfair 3 strikes laws
@_date: 2018-07-30 00:47:49
Buy your bitcoin from localbitcoins or bitquik for cash safer. I don't know what you want to do with the btc but if you use it on dark market from an exchange they can trace it right back to you or your parents.
