This is especially interesting when it comes to currency. It takes the counter party (and human medling) out of the equation. We have an automated central bank and an automated payment system. Improvements are hardwired into code that is voted on with computer power, which is encouraged by greed.
Much more elegant than the current system and, in my opinion, is destined to replace it.

@_date: 2016-08-30 19:59:08
Smaller pot, much less likely to be target by a sofisticated attack. Plus exchanges have to constantly move funds to and from cold storage. It's easier for an individual to just leave it there.
@_date: 2016-08-01 17:51:39
If you push into this it will push right back. If you're going to scream fire, just sell all your coins instead. It sends a much louder message. Holding coins and crying that Bitcoin is in perpetual crisis is all too common around here. 
Also, sort of like how upgrades work. If you have a problem with their meeting make your own meeting. Bitcoin CEO didn't set this up.

Hard forks make us weaker. Trolls are all over the blocksize issue. Bitcoin doubles in value over the last year and they're acting like the sky is falling. Good luck. Not selling.

Instant 5%. Depends on the discount how long the wait is. 25% off anything usually takes a week and works 75% of the time or so. I've saved over $500 this way.

Sell all your coins if you think Bitcoin is Enron. This market doesn't need weak hands. 
@_date: 2016-08-29 10:29:52
Yea, "hoarding money" is new propaganda to discourage savings. Yes, banks put the money back into the economy, but they don't need depositors money if interest rates are negative. They can borrow money for free from central banks then lend out at a higher rate.

It's in defense of what they'll say when Bitcoin is in fact big enough. Even still, moving money on a blockchain to do illegal things in a surveillance state is really a dumb idea. That's why terrorists love cash. We should probably ban cash. /s

@_date: 2016-08-23 10:30:42
Usually the word spike doesn't lend well to discussing how stable something is. Gradually increasing because there's a serious pump going on. It reminds me of when the ether pumpers were spamming by direct message.

One year ago the price of Bitcoin was ~$250. We've been in a bull market, where if you purchased your coins a year ago even with a 36% haircut you're still up a fair amount.
The heist is newsworthy but nothing even close to existential. It's simply not a big deal.
@_date: 2016-08-25 15:23:57
Aren't there 2 ethers now? Last I heard that hard fork didn't go as planned and there's 1 chain where 1 guy hacked like 1/10 of the coins. This seems to overshadow the more transactions per second argument for why ether is better.

@_date: 2016-08-30 09:38:03
No, very early on (before 1 Bitcoin had any value) someone hacked the blockchain to give himself billions of Bitcoin. So this guy's claiming the blockchain can be hacked. Although the hack was resolved, no one lost any money and it was very early in bitcoin's history, so it's a pretty weak point. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 03:27:02
It's just immature. That's how you get in with this much of a discount. Dead wood will burn out and something healthier will emerge to take its place. Bitcoin is a force of nature.

Purse.io is what you're looking for. You can spend it for Bitcoin. You'll get about 80% of face value in Bitcoin. Then you can sell it on localbitcoins.com and get a premium for your Bitcoin. It's a process but you can turn your Amazon money into cash this way.

Should be money they could afford to lose. If you ignore that advice you're leaving yourself vulnerable. Sometimes risks don't pay off.
It's good some people made some money out of this and are fired up the price is actually rising and it didn't take that big of a hit.

@_date: 2016-08-24 15:29:29


Nobody is overpaying for Bitcoin by 30-50%, those orders never settle. At most it's 25%. A couple reasons people would do this is they don't have access to coinbase / circle / have no bank account and are willing to pay a premium to buy BTC with a credit card. Or they have Amazon gift card money they want to spend elsewhere. Amazon gift cards are notoriously difficult to sell because they're attached to your account and have to be spent. Purse is a work around. 
@_date: 2016-04-28 18:48:52
Another bail out or helicopter money or both. Plus QE and negative interest rates. The current system is definitely in rough shape and the people are finally starting to get angry.

Coinbase is one of the best companies for Bitcoin right now and so it's a natural target if you're trying to discourage new users. 
Edit: Downvoted into negatives. Okay. 
@_date: 2016-08-30 22:52:47
Yea but the rate of growth for the price to rise dropped from 8% to 4%. The upward pressure since the halving sort of works like compound interest. The market will wake up.
@_date: 2016-08-05 21:02:53
We've also come a long way in practice since Mt Gox
@_date: 2016-08-09 15:28:25
If you figure a 36% loss against well over a 100% gain in the past year... 1% of coins affected and that's people who day trade and should understand the risks. Simply not a big deal IMO.
@_date: 2016-04-26 18:52:15
Yea, I've literally saved hundreds of dollars using purse. I keep a percentage of what I save in Bitcoin and that's proving to be a better store of value than USD. Fiat has a pinhole leak into crypto right now...

Bitcoin inflation drops from ~9% to ~4.5%. If demand stays the same or increases when the supply drops you can expect the price to go up.
@_date: 2016-04-15 22:51:36

Yea, there was a while where I had a very strong itch to tell anyone I could about Bitcoin once I understood it. I don't evangelize anymore in real life, I do a bit online but for the most part I realize this thing is just going to unfold on its own. The amount of investment banks and central banks getting involved with blockchain technology just reaffirms we're on the cusp of something historic. It's a wild ride and I think it's just getting started.

Also the housing market imploded in 2008 but was bailed out by central banks to prop up the bubble. I'm just saying he might have been better off if he forgot about these bitcoins for a while longer, but took a traditional approach instead. Buy housing, the central banks have got his back, right?

It’s actually growing a huge amount. You can get some idea by the fact that price has risen considerably, and also volatility has actually reduced as the price rose.

The CEO of by far the biggest bitcoin bank is basically saying he is expecting bitcoin to be dethroned as the top crypto because of scaling issues, when he’s the biggest entity blocking adoption of the current scaling solution. 
Follow the money. They want people trading alts back and forth, not hodling bitcoin. As long as they’re getting new users by the hundred thousand they could give a shit about 10,000 closing their accounts out of principle. 
Quite a situation. But they’re just blowing air into the altcoin market. Honey badger will probably ultimately disintermediate them too in time, unless they adapt.

This thing is still undervalued. $180 billion market cap for a currency that has so far been a better store of value than any government currency for the last 8 years in a row, plus will have a lower rate of inflation than gold, only to halve again every 4 years. 
You’re right here at ground zero and you’re trying to talk people out of what’s shaping up to be the next wave of the internet (which we’ve seen disrupt every industry except finance). If you don’t get it, get out of the way. Don’t quote warren buffet.

The timing of everything today seems like they’re trying to steer the market away from bitcoin’s core devs. They added BCH when BCH became more profitable to mine than BTC (this is historically a time when BCH pumps in price and gets flooded with concern trolls). Also adding BCH before supporting Segwit. Also supporting the failed Segwit2X fork. 
If you’re a fan of game theory it’s pretty easy to see which team they’re playing on. They’re trying to leverage their influence to steer development from the guys who have been here since the beginning and steer it toward who knows what.

How could you demonstrate that it’s your wallet if you lost the private key. 
I’ve had this question for a while. What happens if you move your coins off of Coinbase then get robbed? Let’s say you get audited because you “sold” thousands in bitcoin, but then get hacked and lose access to those coins? How can the IRS tell the difference between you moving the coins and a thief? On the flip side, wouldn’t you expect a lot of people to say they got robbed? How could they prove any of this?

First in first out. Figure out when you purchased the earliest coins you have / how many you sold. If you made gains in less than 2 years then it gets tax like income.

You're taking it to an extreme and then dismissing it. How do you know 100% of the volume is fake? Do you have any evidence that any of it is fake?

Thanks for sharing, personally I find it unlikely that we have just one go at life. If time is infinite and you only live once isn't it overwhelmingly more likely that at this moment you would be dead, not alive?

At that point there's no reason for mining. If you all agree on how much to mine you probably already agree on which transactions have occurred. You might as well have a ledger. 
The key with Bitcoin is that it's trustless. Nobody has to trust anybody else, yet through the incentive of mining we know which transactions have occurred, no matter what anyone else claims. Much more scalable.

I guess. It's been pretty difficult to change the blocksize, which in my ignorant opinion seems like an obvious change to be made. Raising the cap won't happen. If it (by some miracle) did people would pile into some other coin then Bitcoin would react by putting the cap back in place.

If you send someone $1 through change tip and they withdraw to breadwallet or a blockchain.info account to get a feel for how transactions work I'd call that a huge win. 
If all they do is pay that tip forward it's true that bitcoin has little to do with what they are sending. It might as well be a paypal transaction. But *perhaps* it will peak their interest in bitcoin so they can figure out what it is and what the implications are. In this case changetip is just training wheels. Bitcoin is complicated. You can't expect everyone to open a bitstamp account to beam BTC to cold storage. 
In the short term we're going to see walled gardens. Sort of like how AOL was a walled garden to the early internet. It's just easier for people to use / understand

I think the market is 90% speculation and when good news happens people are pissed that the price didn't rise so they dump their coins. Weak hands, plus high inflation. I guarantee by the end of 2016 we're over $320. I say 2016 because there will be 5% inflation right around the corner and 2 years of VC money getting people to find reasons that they should use BTC.
Until miners entirely stop mining Bitcoin is fine.

It's an interesting concept but I think this concept would have to ride specifically on top of bitcoin to succeed. 
One of the biggest factors in why bitcoin has  any value is because it's limited. If you start introducing more and more altcoins then they are no loner limited and no longer have any value. That's what we're seeing happening in the altcoin markets now. 
Also, isn't this sort of what colored coins was getting at?

From what I've read, because it's a peer to peer transaction, you don't have to worry about money transmitter laws because you're not a third party. It's like selling someone gold in cash on craigslist. Nothing illegal about that.

It would have marginally more appeal. The discussion would shift to "why is it using all of that power to generate prime numbers, do we really need them, complete waste of electricity, etc"
Primes would just confuse how proof of work is an important mechanism by itself. It's not wasted computer power, it is a major puzzle piece that allows bitcoin to function

No. 
Think about the internet.. It allowed communication to become decentralized. We no longer get our media from the top down necessarily, as we can converse peer to peer on the internet, among other things. That breakthrough in communication changed the world. 
There is a small but arguably the most important subset of information that has so far not been able to be decentralized. That subset is value / money. Until bitcoin we had to rely on centralized corporations / institutions (central banks, banks, credit processors, corporations) to make financial transactions on the internet. Now we have a decentralized system to store and transfer value on the internet in a decentralize way, making central banks, banks and credit processors irrelevant. 
In my opinion bitcoin is a bigger breakthrough than the internet itself. We now have a distributed, decentralized ledger of wealth that solves the problem of fiat currency being watered down through inflation while at the same time allowing transactions to occur faster, more securely and for a tiny fraction of what it cost legacy systems. 
tl;dr bitcoin is the internet of money and is a breakthrough for civilization. Time will tell if this lofty claim is true but in the 3 years bitcoins have had any value they have created quite a stir globally.

I think the current financial system is a house of cards. Fractional reserve banking, quantitative easing, massive deficit spending, huge amounts of consumer debt. 
Meanwhile the world is waking up to bitcoin at an exponential rate. It takes a while for the message to get across, but when it does people get scary excited. There's this "oh shit" moment where people realize this isn't the next paypal.. It's the next financial system!
VC money is pouring in, the financial news is reporting daily, the right tech minds are weighing in, governments are weighing in, central banks are weighing in. All over an $8 billion economy?
I think this could happen scary fast. I think the only thing holding the market back is human psychology. This is clearly the best method of money transfer available and it's proved that humans can work as a hive instead of top down in order to solve a problem. This is a revolution.
In terms of price per coin.. That's hard to say. But Satoshi made each 1 BTC divisible into 100,000,000 units for a reason. This person/group clearly had some foresight.

@_date: 2014-10-28 16:02:03
Adding more coins actually weakens the cryptocurreny market. It's the fact that bitcoins are inherently limited (21 million) that makes them have any value at all. When you start making unlimited altcoin clones of bitcoin how many units are there?
There are 10's of millions of dollars invested in altcoins that don't understand this concept. Accepting a new altcoin just confuses people who are still having trouble wrapping their heads around cryptocurency and (possibly) pumps the value of some altcoin for some people. 
@_date: 2014-10-29 03:01:02
Interesting. It would explain the night price run up last November seemingly out of nowhere.

I think coinbase.com just recently opened up to the UK. I use coinbase in the US and it's a great service, fees are on the order of 1%, possibly 0% if selling?
Try them, you'll need to trust them with your bank account info for the withdrawal (if you do your research you'll fine they're credible with this info) and it will take a few days to transfer to your account.
If you know nothing about bitcoin it's an interesting gamble. Most here would recommend you hang on to it, it could crash to 0 for sure but if this experiment works then the price will have to rise 100x or more (which I realize sounds insane). You might kick yourself in 5 years though.

I think you'll need conviction as an investor if you want to make serious money, if this does in fact pull through and become the dominant means of exchange.

I think we're seeing the image start to shift. People who only hear about bitcoin passively are surprised it's had staying power. PayPal getting involved is a nice stamp of approval. There are documentaries that are being released. Things are headed in the right direction quickly. 
The software side of things is just a matter of time.. I payed with breadwallet to Bitpay for dinner last night and it was crazy smooth. The only issue was the waitress had no idea what bitcoin is or why I'd rather pay that way.
Public education is probably the biggest hurdle so in that way I agree with the parallels OP is trying to draw. People need to be sold on why they should even care.

Money is a representation of capital. My point still stands that money is the heart of the economy. Why does anyone go to work? To produce capital?? Money is the incentive that allows capital to exist! And in my opinion money just got a big upgrade.
You can read economic textbooks all day and you're not going to run into anything about distributed consensus or digital scarcity. We're in uncharted water here. I'm sorry you lack the vision to see where bitcoin is headed beyond its current form, but Satoshi wasn't trying to compete with paypal and mastercard or make some new exotic financial instrument. He had clear intentions and has so far proven to be a visionary.

This isn't an existential threat to bitcoin. Bitcoin was designed to compete with central banks, not paypal and Visa. 
In the short term this apple rumor might be useful for people in the first world beaming money to each other (it's nuts that this still isn't practical / possible on a large scale yet, I wouldn't doubt credit card companies are feeling threatened by bitcoin's innovation if they did in fact team up with Apple) but the silver lining here is that this is going to spark a big discussion about bitcoin. The dollar is still inherently flawed, no matter how apple packages this. And legacy systems will always cost more, no matter how conveniently they work in the fees.
Also it would be a kick ass move if this led to Google or any other competitor to get more heavily involved in bitcoin. 
I'm still not worried about the long term.

Why would anyone stop accepting? Even if no one paid using BTC there's no risk to keeping that payment option available. That'd be like making a website in 1995 with free hosting then taking it down halfway through 1995 because you didn't get enough hits.

He launched it beginning of January 2009 and made the halving every 4 years. It's outpacing itself a fair amount even with difficulty adjustments so rather than beginning of 2017 the next halving with be early or mid 2016. Better to have the halving right before the election in November than right after it. 
I absolutely think this was on purpose.
This next halving is pretty critical too, going from 10% yearly inflation to a much more reasonable 5%.

This would all be true if there was no actual demand for anything other than speculating. 
But that's not the case. People are buying bitcoins to buy things that money transmitters won't let them buy and they're going to continue whether the price is $1100 or $10. 
But the market is going to find an equilibrium where mining fees pushing down balance with the actual demand that's pushing the price higher. There are also more use cases on the horizon so there is only reason to suspect the demand is going to increase.
Seems like the author of this post is hoping bitcoin collapses so they don't have to do the research to figure out what bitcoin actually is. Unfortunately for them they're going to regret this post when they're still talking about it years from now.

“There’s no doubt that in the short term restricting Russian usage of SWIFT would be extremely disruptive to Russian financial and commercial activities,” said Richard Reid, a research fellow for finance and regulation at the University of Dundee in Scotland. “However, it may carry a longer-term downside, **namely the likelihood that large chunks of Russian international payments flows would move to much less well monitored and measured financial channels** and thus be beyond sanctions at any future point.”

I was mining in early 2012. I had no idea what I was doing, I just stumbled upon instruction but never joined a pool or anything so it just made my computer run hot and eventually burned out the GPU.
Around that time I was using paypal to send money to pay rent to my father and was trying to figure out a better way. I looked back into bitcoin and realized it wouldn't work (only exchange was in japan? Sounds sketchy..) but was thinking I should throw $50 in to see what would happen. Never did, moved on. Lost interest. Heard about it again in summer of 2013 and I've been hooked ever since. Literally read articles every day.
I searched my old hard drives for the wallet.dat file from when I was mining and found it. I almost shit my pants. Opened it up and it was worthless.

Bitcoin is decentralized. That's what makes it so valuable. It is a decentralized way for everyone to agree without having to trust anybody else.
You can't just make your own centralized blockchain. Well you can, but that's called a ledger, which is what banks already use.
It's hard to understand at first but the entire reason bitcoin is a breakthrough and so interesting is because we now have a massive public ledger that everyone can trust **without a central authority**. 
If a bank wants to launch an altcoin they can go that route to creat their own decentralized ledger but bitcoin has a massive head start and last time I checked there were over 500 altcoins with a collective  value of 1/10 of bitcoin.
When people talk about "blockchain technology" they are talking  about bitcoin whether they realize it or not.

The problems you're describing are also inherently a part of an inflationary currency. 
Inflation causes asset bubbles, those who can afford to park their money in assets benefit, those living paycheck to paycheck have to swim upstream.
Also if 2008 taught us anything it's that the wealthiest of us benefit when the bubbles pop and the market corrects. It blows my mind that people think we need an elite group pulling the strings to make markets more efficient. 
You are also totally off topic. I was talking about how debt saps wealth from the middle class. More debt saps more wealth and we need more debt for the economy to grow. It's not sustainable.

It depends on how much bitcoin you have and for what purpose.
If you have $50 in an account to play around with to try it out then yea, Coinbase is fine to store on.
If you have $1,000 in your Coinbase account because you think over the next few years that could explode in value, then no Coinbase is not safe to store on. Your account could get hacked, Coinbase could fail or get shut down. 
If you're thinking long term and/or it's a signifant amount of money look into cold storage. Otherwise, yea Coinbase is fine.

My point is that technology is evolution. It's not inherently good or bad, but it's undeniably pushing us forward and to ignore / avoid it is to your own detriment. Adapt or die out.

He's more likely than not here for good. He's about to disrupt the 1%, banks, Wall Street, which the people have lost control over.
He could dump his coins but bitcoin will still exist and the financial industry will still be disrupted. He won't though. Instead he's going to become very important politically

2) Are seasoned investors incapable of identifying longterm growth? And isn't the fact that it's an "unsanctioned currency" already factored into the price?

This a long shot but it's possible.
A trillionaire who disrupted world finance and possibly toppled governments will get some people's attention. The way he moves his money will send shock waves through the world economy. He's going to become important politically, and historically.

Those are coins that Satoshi Nakamoto mined when he was trying to get bitcoin off the ground. As more miners and developers got involved he weaned his computer power off of the network and stop contributing to the project. 
It's estimated that he's sitting on 1,000,000 BTC and my guess is he has access to those coins. If bitcoin reaches its potential then he's is going to be a very rich and very important person. Or maybe he'll burn the coins, who knows.
There a lot of speculation that Satoshi is Nick Szabo, but if you dig into it nobody really knows who Nick Szabo is either. But Nick has a blog and is clearly extremely intelligent in a lot of different fields.

Barry keeps saying the outcome is binary with bitcoin. I agree entirely. 
I don't think we'll see a time where bitcoin stablizes for a while at 50,000 / coin and you'll see acquisitions like this..

That and there's a trend of new technologies taking less and less time to reach mainstream adoption.

I want to make a meditation center that uses a bitcoin faucet to pay out BTC as a reward for meditating. 
Instead of solving a capta to receive BTC an EEG cap could monitor brain wave activity and pay out participants for every X minute of meditation. If we make it to the moon I'll fund the project for a while. If people like the idea they can donate directly to the faucet. If not, it dries up and we all go home.

We can pump the breaks and tone down the message but it's hard to ignore the momentum behind this thing.

Don't be a dick. Inflation being cyclically hoarded during price increases is absolutely unique to cryptocurrencies. If it was purely as simple as supply and demand you wouldn't have these dramatic boom and busy cycles.

There is a reason Satoshi made each bitcoin divisible to 100,000,000 units. He clearly had some foresight with this and it's becoming increasingly possible that this could replace fiat currency.

Maybe the treasury could redistribute directly to the users (bitcoin now makes this possible) Perhaps the payment to users could be weighted by the content they posted or their level or something.
If you introduce a financial incentive to get involved, even if it's just micropayments, you're going to draw a lot of attention.. which in turn might encourage donations to the treasury.

I'm purely a speculator in all this. I agree with a lot of the criticism of bitcoin for mainstream use at this point but I also see it evolving extremely quickly and as being inevitable that we move to cryptocurrencies. Probably bitcoin, which could make this an absurdly lucrative investment.
In the short term I think it's probably used more for getting around money transmitters, which is likely mostly illegal activity, but I'm all for freedom of choice especially in the case of money. In fact I think it's terrifying for society to lose control of its freedom of money.

I wasn't sure what you meant by a "beneficial price." Bitcoin isn't a stock. 
The price of bitcoin is irrelevant to people who use bitcoin only as a method of transfer, like for remittances or to buy drugs. If demand to use bitcoin as a transaction network increases so does the price. I find it hard to believe we've seen the transaction volume peak, so I find it hard to believe we've seen the price peak. 
To me it seems like it's a glaringly obvious time to get in at a beneficial price.
But I honestly just wanted to clear up that you understood that you don't need an entire bitcoin, that's a big hurdle for skeptics.

There's a reason Satoshi embedded [this]( into the second block of the blockchain. 
The goal of the system isn't to create a better centralized ledger or better transaction system. The goal is to make central banks irrelevant and return to money with a finite supply.
"The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve." - Satoshi Nakamoto

Wealth inequality is a reality of capitalism. 
One difference between fiat and bitcoin though is that bitcoin can be distributed much more efficiently.

I used stumble upon in early 2012 and read a little about it and even downloaded a program to mine with my GPU. I remember closing the program almost every time I went to use my computer because it was slowing things down considerably and I started to suspect it was a virus of some kind. That computer later would shut down randomly if I was playing games that would push the GPU and eventually it shit the bed for good.
Fast forward to summer of 2013 and my dad asked me if I had heard of bitcoin, he also knew very little but it rang a bell for me. (Around this time I started having reoccurring dreams that I won the lottery.) I did some research, fell in love with the idea, and bought a bitcoin on coinbase at $116. I rode the bubble at the end of 2013 and couldn't stop telling people that they should be paying attention because there was a rumbling here.
When the price was still high (relative ~$800) there were tons of stories of people who mined early on and found old hard drives with significant amounts of money stored. Luckily my father would back up hard drives whenever he was fixing an issue and so we searched three different portable hard drives looking for a wallet.dat file. We found one. I almost shit my pants that night. I figured out how to check blockchain.info to see if mining in 2012 had worked. I opened it up and... Nothing. 0BTC. That was okay though. I didn't win the lottery, but I still have faith in the system long term.
Now I have some coins in cold storage and I'm just watching and educating when I get the chance. I'm moving to Dominica in May of 2015 purely by chance (my Gf is going to medical school there) and I have a feeling my story is just getting started. We live in an interesting time and it's amazing to be a part of something that I feel is truly pushing the human race forward.

When you calculate the cost of a transaction in USD do you take the growth of the money supply and divide it over the number of transactions?
**Bitcoin transactions cost $.01**
There is currently *10% inflation*. That inflation hurts speculators assuming interest doesn't grow at at least that rate. But bitcoin transactions obviously don't cost you and me $15. 


Altcoins (competition) is what would stop them. Forking for profit would destroy bitcoin's reputation and likely set cryptocurrency back years, and would only cost miners money. That's why this has never happened and also why it will never happen.

So what about probably fair gambling, cheaper remittances, micro transactions, a hedge against the dollar, cheaper wire transfers, allowing transactions barred by traditional payment processors...
I feel like there are  factors other than that it's cheaper to transact that will drive adoption. I think it's those other use cases that are ultimately going to prop it up and make it a better alternative to credit cards (it's hard to steal 60 million private keys in one go)

No, they don't see the contradiction. It just shows they fundamentally don't understand the technology. 
You can't have a blockchain without incentives to mine and tockets to transfer that have to have some agreed upon value.
You can't "use blockchain technology" in a centralized way, that's called a ledger which is what everybody already uses.
You're welcome to create your own altcoin but good luck establishing value from scratch. There are over 500 others out there.
Bitcoin is *the* blockchain whether CEOs and bank executives realize it or not.

Yes. It is mined at a predictable rate.

Lost coins will never be a problem. Each bitcoin is 100,000,000 units so even if we lost 99.9% of them (extremely unlikely) the system would still function. It would just increase the value of each Satoshi that did exist.
Personally I don't see a single way this can fail. I think the sentiment has changed in because people have lost money speculating (history repeats itself). But think about what Satoshi is witnessing. An entirely decentralized and autonomous system has been functioning for years and governments and central banks are taking notice. Millions of people are involved and it makes the financial news almost every day.
I think we're witnessing something massive waking up. Keep an eye on the big picture (as if the day to day isn't encouraging enough)

If bitcoin ever reaches its potential the price would have to scale 10,000 times. Maybe more.
Psuedo-economics aside, if bitcoin actually is the future then one bitcoin is a life changing amount of money. Why risk much more than that on something that is far from guaranteed. (although I honestly can't think of a single way it will fail)
@_date: 2014-11-22 20:08:58
I have a feeling this next bubble could possibly be the last. I also realize that's an insane long shot, but:
I can't see this continuing to grow explosively and pull back, it's on the right people's radar now. It wouldn't take much to cause an explosion in price and it wouldn't take much to knock down our current financial house of cards. Money moves quickly and bitcoin is so obviously better.

It's not cheaper than the standard currency, buying $100 worth of bitcoin is worth $100. 
It's cheaper to *transact* than any other currency. 
With fiat you need a third party, like a bank for a wire transfer or a credit processor like visa to move money over the internet. With bitcoin the payment processor is built into the currency. You can send $10,000,000 to china and it will transfer instantly and cost you 5 cents. That's pretty powerful.
What you might end up seeing in the near future is merchants *preferring* bitcoin over visa or MasterCard because it's cheaper than a 3% credit card transaction and arguably more secure.

Another price move and there are so many feedback loops in place:
People having passively heard about bitcoin but already think it died because the media failed them.
The media drawing new lines in the sand with a new ATH.
People holding small amounts from changetip and understanding that there's been a clear longterm pattern in the direction of the volatility. And all the people who didn't accept their tips will be kicking themselves.
Companies that already accept bitcoin could get a rush of new customers. New companies start accepting and BTC can't stay out of the news.
Central banks / anybody who endorsed blockchain technology but not BTC can only call this a bubble for so long.
...and it's most likely going to happen. Transactions keep breaking new highs along with pretty much every metric other than price. Apparently $14 to $1200 in a year in 2013 was unsustainable...

There isn't consumer protection. The difference is that it's push transactions vs pull transactions. 
To pay by credit card you need to trust the company with your credit card information and they "pull" money from your account. With bitcoin they can't "pull" money from you. You the customer "push" the money to them much like handing somebody cash. 
If you push the money to the wrong account or in the wrong amount you're shit out of luck unfortunately. But the upside is it's a lot harder to get your bitcoin identity stolen, assuming you take proper precautions.

I absolutely admit that on the surface it looks like a ponzi scheme, but until you understand what the blockchain is and what function mining provides your opinion is invalid.

We need increasingly more debt for the economy to grow with inflationary currency. More debt, more money funneled to banks. It's simple.
With a deflationary currency debt would still help finance growth, but it would take more risk to finance debt so there would be much less of it. Less debt, fewer asset bubbles, more stable economy.

They consistently get basic facts wrong. 
There is only *ever* going to be 21 million bitcoins, there are not 21 million bitcoins currently. If the number of miners decreases the number of coins put into circulation will *not* be reduced. The difficulty adjusts to keep the rate of bitcoins mined consistent. You can't have bitcoin the block chain without bitcoin the currency, they're the same damn thing.
It's absurd how often they miss the very basics then draw elaborate conclusions when they're working with a shaky foundation to begin with. It's no wonder most people still think bitcoin is a scam / complete speculative bubble, the media has been failing them

That's not what I said, I'm saying people naturally seek deflationary assets if they want a safe investment. We have a housing market hording value which does nothing for the economy.

Bitcoin is by no means a safer investment than a house obviously.

Don't people using bitcoin as a method of transfer give bitcoin value? As long as it is cheaper to use as a method of transfer it will have value as value is passing through it. 
Speculators are definitely more responsible for the relative high exchange rate than people actually using it as a method of transfer... but as long as you have people using bitcoin as a method of transfer you have a floor for the price. 
I just can't see credit cards or wire transfers as being the holy grail of transferring value. It just makes too much sense to me philosophically that a global nationless currency should emerge out of the internet.

I think the scenario that your missing is:
What if gshash quietly gets 70% of the network and we all feel comfortable because it's not in their interest to attack the network, then ghash gets hacked and taken over by a government who want to shut this new economy down. In this scenario it's no longer distributed and has a central point of failure. 
I don't think this is an existential threat though because a fix would be implemented in this case through a hard fork or new coin, but it would be a serious roadblock on the way to adoption.

If mining were to ever become centralized the price would tank. When Ghash had 51% of the network the price dropped enough that they lost money vs if they held steady mining 45% of the network.
Transactions currently cost $.01. If miners raised that to $10 they would instantly tank the price and all their mining equipment would be useless. That's why this has never happened and also why it never will happen.

Demand to *use* bitcoin would require demand to *buy* bitcoin. Even if they only hold value in bitcoin for 5 minutes there is only so much of it. As use cases increase the demand is going to increase.
As long as people are using bitcoin there is always going be a volatile exchange rate and as long as there is a volatile exchange rate there is going to be speculators. The more speculators the more liquidity, the more liquidity the more use cases.

You can now send money through email, Twitter, reddit, SMS and YouTube for one. Most Ponzi schemes don't introduce groundbreaking technological advances.
What other Ponzi scheme is accepted as currency by dell, newegg and is championed by the CEO of overstock?
Bill Gates has said positive things about BTC, Sergey Brinn has said cryptocurrencies are inevitable. Julian Assange has been talking about BTC and how it's revolutionary for years now. The Wall Street Journal has a new section of their paper called Bitbeat where they talk about cryptocurencies.

It definitely matters if it goes to the moon or not.
If people actually use it, the price pretty much has to go up. It's hard to tell how many people are actually using it, but one indicator of the health of the Bitcoin economy is the price. If you think it's going to be popular in the future investing in it now probably isn't a bad idea.

If bitcoin (and the world economy) were stagnant you would be absolutely correct, but they're not.

Not necessarily an idiot, but definitely uninformed. Par for the course. 
I wonder why Satoshi chose 21 million. $300 is a crazy amount of money for 1 unit at this point in adoption and maybe 2,100 million would have helped psychologically. $3 for 1 unit would be easier to understand, but then again it would have been harder to get to dollar parity and might have never taken off the ground. 
The fact that 1 Bitcoin is worth *significantly* more than 1 USD *should* drive home the point that despite the fact that it's intangible it is still valuable, but instead it boggles the mind and people assume it's a mania / bubble.

Bitcoin has to be worth some agreed upon amount in order to exchange value. The higher that value is, the more value that can be moved through the network. 
The more speculators you have driving the price up the more utility you have (you can move larger amounts through the network without rocking the market)

Even if he sells all of his coins and tanks the market we still have this revolutionary currency and payment system. 
And if he shakes confidence in Bitcoin people will move to altcoins that haven't been premined. 
It would basically be a big cluster fuck if he did anything other than not touching them unless to destroy them. I hope that he's waiting for the right moment to destroy them to open the floodgates on adoption but that might be naive.
But who knows, maybe we're all being played and as soon as he cashes out his hundreds of millions or billions he'll hang on to USD and call us all dumbasses for thinking this was going anywhere.

There was a lot of confusion around the time the last bubble popped.

If it is truely so great for merchants they will offer a discount to pay with bitcoin. Transactions fees have so far been driven to 0 with bitcoin. They will eventually go negative. Give it time, infrastructure. 
I still don't see this the way that mass adoption will happen. It will happen when people realize that their local currency is worse than bitcoin, which will take the financial collapse in a given country.

That's not a bad introduction, but it's not entirely true so it's a little deceptive.
I'm not sure what the best way to explain bitcoin is. It's almost a case by case situation where you explain as much as a person can understand or is willing to listen to. Saying that it's paypal on steroids might be the lowest common denominator for people but it's not that great of an explanation IMO.

Without QE interest rates rise. Not sure how the stock market *doesn't* correct if there is no more QE.
Bitcoin could weaken for many months, who knows. It's such a strange market. I get the feeling we're getting toward the end of the decline in price but I've had that feeling since July. 
I am extremely confident the price will rise in the long run though. There's so much excitement about "blockchain technology" recently and from here it seems like bitcoin is far and away the most promising blockchain.

Bitcoin has existed for 5 years, only had any value at all for 3 years and only had serious VC money and media attention for 1 year. This is happening extremely quickly. The price has been trending down for a while (8 months?) but it's up 400% since 1 year ago and was trading for $15 two years ago.
If you don't have a stomach for volatility this isn't for you as an investment. But if it's money you can gamble the sky is the limit on the price. There is a reason Satoshi chose each bitcoin to be divisible into 100,000,000 pieces. His intent was to compete with central banks, not paypal and visa. This is an extremely ambitious experiment, not a stock. There is a rabbit hole of information out there related to bitcoin and the deeper people go, the crazier they sound to the outside world. It's your call if you think they're onto something or just plain nuts.

This is an interesting project and I would love to see it work!
I think it would be possible to implement N of M transactions using a multisig wallet so that you would **need** a majority vote to move the funds. The treasury could be bitcoins on the blockchain and require a certain number of "votes" to be able to actually move the money. Without these "votes" to the multisig wallet no one would have the ability to move the money. This would shift trust from whoever currently holds the money instead over to the blockchain (and the voters). This is theorized about a lot but I don't know that it's been successfully implemented but it seems to line up perfectly with Empeopled's mission.
It makes sense right now that the site resembles reddit a bit in content, but I would hope that as this project grows it could move in a much more profound direction.
The key here is decentralization. You are *decentralizing* ownership of a platform aimed at empowering people (great start). I'm going to keep a close eye on this project because it seems potentially very powerful.
Also you might want to get in contact with the people at changetip, it's an amazing service and perhaps voters might want to implement it..

A finite supply of currency doesn't restrict economic growth. The gold standard worked great for thousands of years with periods of deflation and strong economic growth at the same time. 
But that actually doesn't even matter. If people had a choice they would choose deflationary currency over inflationary currency because, shit, your money would be worth more as the economy grows, not less.
Bitcoin currently depends heavily on a handful of companies but it's come a long way since relying pretty much exclusively on MTGox. As the industry matures there are more competitors coming on board.
A world where people think paper currency is immune to failing on a grand scale is a world where people are ignoring history. If you think paper backed by nothing is the apex of economic prosperity you're delusional.

I think you'll be proven wrong in time. 
It's theoretically better money in that has a built in transaction system better than any fiat payment processor (cheaper, faster, theoretically more secure). That alone is enough for it to win out. 
If you add in the historical perspective that we are printing the world's reserve currency at unprecedented rates and have already evaporated 97% of the dollar's value over the last 100 years by printing faster than economic growth, you have a second, even bigger driving force. 
We're still looking for a solution to the financial crisis of 2008. We still have yet to feel the effects of printing money as the financial crisis ripples around the world.
Satoshi's intent wasn't to compete with paypal, he was trying to correct the corruption at the center of civilization, money creation.

When you purchase bonds you are essentially becoming a lender through a middle man. 
I think there will still be a middle man but it will be a website using some kind of decentralized credit rating system.

Satoshi decided to make each bitcoin divisible into 100,000,000 parts for a reason. I don't think this was for micro transactions, I think Satoshi obviously had incredible foresight to have designed this system. 
I think a lot of people are missing the monetary collapse part. I have a hard time seeing bitcoin have another rally that is "only" 10X in price. The media is going to fuel the hell out of this next rally and big money is aware that this exists (even if they're not entirely convinced yet). Also if you have one major bank betting on BTC the whole house of cards falls down worldwide. 
I bet one, maybe two more rallies and we're on the moon. It's going to happen absurdly quickly

A malicious attacker has 51%, starts double spending transactions, buying gold over and over, investors panic when they immediately realize the system is being attacked, the price crashes pretty low but not to nothing.

There is *currently* no advantage to the average Joe. 
In a hypothetical bitcoin economy where mass adoption has already taken place and the volatility is negligible, the benefits are *staggering* and in a lot of cases obvious:
Much more secure payments / less identity theft than credit cards
Tipping on the internet / micro funding / micropayment walls rather than advertising or monthly subscription fees. This will change the internet for the better. Better content, less advertising, decentralized entertainment (think people posting truly quality content for tips rather than trying to get a spot Netflix.)
Crowdfunding will be a whole lot easier. It could be a post to a forum or to youtube video rather than using kickstarter. I would bet this leads to more charity, simply because it will be easier and more direct.
No banking fees, negligible transfer fees, instant transactions. Beam money to anybody you know instantly using your phone. 
Banking for the 3rd world
Fewer barriers to entrance into stock exchanges.
Global currency.
Deflationary currency that appreciates in value as the world economy grows.
Entirely new business models for new services we can't yet foresee (in the same way that the internet was an abstraction at first where no one could foresee twitter, amazon, YouTube, etc)
In the short term the average Joe might want to invest. To use it at this point requires going out of your way, but there's a momentum of people using bitcoin because  it's the right thing to do in their opinion. It brings this hypothetical future about sooner. 
This is all without getting into the politics.

You bought at the peak of a bubble. I don't know if you noticed but there is a pattern to these bubbles and the fundamentals have only been improving. You probably didn't buy at the highest price Bitcoin will ever go, but you also sound like you're going to lose your position on the way up if that's where this is headed.

Hypothetical: Imagine if Bitcoin blows up and replaces fiat (7 transactions a second, I realize some people can't fathom this thing evolving) and early adopters, of which we *are all in fact* still a part of, get disgustingly rich. Like, central bank rich. 
Imagine if bitcoiners realize money is a game and sort of an illusion and "success" and blind hard work are not actually the same thing. Bitcoiners might give significant amounts of money away. Probably *significantly* more than today's billionaires who feel more entitled to yachts and mansions for all of their genius (ego).
Projects like paying people to read books, or my personal favorite, paying people to meditate might become commonplace (seeded by Bitcoin rich), and just in time too as capitalism is breaking down as technology is eliminating jobs at an ever increasing rate. 
We might be on the cusp of the nature of "work" changing. This is what excites me longterm about Bitcoin, philanthropy could encourage behaviors and wealth could be much more fluid. There will still be drudge jobs but what if you could read a book to save up to pay your barista for a coffee? I think that world make the world a better place

1 million bitcoins is currently less than 10% and will be less than 5% of bitcoins in existence. The incentives involved with Bitcoin are based on game theory. If Bitcoin goes mainstream he/she/they/it could only own 5-10% of the whole. That means we're not likely to end up under some fascist dictatorship where satoshi pulls some power grab. There will just be one person or group that is extremely wealthy, but out voted 15 to 1 in terms of global influence. Honestly I like the idea of that better than central banking.

It's not anonymous actually, it's a massive ledger of transaction history. Attaching a name to a transaction can be difficult but it's not impossible. 
The whole point of bitcoin seems to be financial sovereignty. It's money that can't be taken away from you, manipulated by a central entity, or frozen from transacting with whoever you want. There's a nice bonus that the transactions are nearly free and are theoretically programmable. That doesn't mean that a government coundn't throw you in jail for not paying your bitcoin taxes. But if bitcoin takes off it's a big enough deal that it could fundamentally change government IMO.

It's likely Ross Ulbricht gave up his coins in some type of bargain with the courts (I'm assuming you're talking about silk road coins).

They can't simply be frozen by authorities.

Economic instability is usually what causes wars. I see the current financial system as a house of cards and bitcoin as being the solution. I worry that bitcoin could blow the house of cards over pretty quickly with a pretty massive economic collapse of traditional banks (think 2008 without a bailout) followed by a crypto renaissance. I worry that the transition might be incredibly rocky.
I realize I'm out there in my predictions but if the price rises another order of magnitude I'll be another order of magnitude more likely to be correct about the current system collapsing.

Use coinbase.com (attach a bank account) or Circle.com (Debit/CC) if in the US or Europe. If you're looking to purchase a large amount then you need to look into securing your BTC because trusting a startup with your bitcoin is not smart. Petty cash on those sites would be fine, odds are they wont go under and you wont get hacked.
If you're making a bigger purchase and want to secure it consider buying a [ledger wallet]( or [trezor]( Both are well respected within this community and are as user friendly and as safe as it gets for securing bitcoins. Nothing tangible that says you own bitcoins, you just get access to control some bits on the block chain. This might mean nothing in 20 years or it might mean a lot.

I think we're *still* seeing weak hands from speculators falling out from last year's speculative bubble. People who panic bought at $800/BTC see good news but the price trending down and they're *still* cutting their losses. That and selling pressure from mining is higher than demand and so we still haven't found an equilibrium for a fair price 
Anyone long on bitcoin is less concerned about the price dropping. It went from 5 cents to $500 in three years and shows no signs of slowing down (central banks praising the blockchain, ETF on the way, paypal news today, VC money at work, higher profile merchant acceptance with no sign of slowing down, all that without putting on an economic tinfoil hat and looking at the current state of the economy)
The only thing that's not exciting about bitcoin ATM is the price. I have a feeling that's going to catch up to the news. Bitcoin tends to grow for a few weeks then taper for 40 or so. 
@_date: 2016-03-27 15:19:58
Maybe the fees growing is still growth, and an inevitable stage in bitcoin's evolution. How many transactions that are currently paying 1 cent are not important if they're not worth 6 cents? Maybe those transactions might as well be off chain and that's still growth. Decentralization of bitcoin's network is more important than saving a few pennies using Bitcoin on chain to buy a coffee.
That having been said I think Bitcoin is much more resilient than this debate is giving credit. Ultimately the market will make the right decision, whatever that is, no matter who tries to rock the boat.

The problem with this is counter party risk. You need to trust whoever is "in charge" rather than having a decentralized system of incentives like bitcoin is. You could make a crypto set up in this way and let the free market decide if it's better than bitcoin (it will fail).
Satoshi is not a crude central banker because despite all the volatility he hasn't moved any coins. He also doesn't benefit from any sort of tax on the system.

Make a BTC faucet that, rather than a captcha, requires the user to be in a meditative state and prove it with an EEG cap in order to "solve" the faucet and get paid out in BTC. Essentially paying people to meditate. 
If / when I get bitcoin rich I'm going to see this idea through. I don't care if someone else does it first, I just think the world would be a better place if there was a financial incentive to meditate. I also think it's a cause people would want to donate to, and with BTC you could donate directly to the faucet rather than the organization. 
BTC would make the donation and payouts way fluid.

Outlawing tumblers and mixers wouldn't work. It will always be an option to hide funds I think. You can't freeze transactions and it's global so somewhere on the planet you can alway tumble/shuffle.

 As capitalism continues to evolve and jobs are automated the need for humans to "work" is decreasing. The only thing standing in the way of every human's basic needs being met is ourselves. 
Robots replacing jobs is a net gain for humanity but generally people fear this progress. The problem is that new wealth gets funneled to the top. 
I think Bitcoin makes redistributing wealth from the super wealthy to common people much easier. In a hypothetical Bitcoin economy super wealthy could seed entire economies or fund projects that redistribute wealth for the benefit of a large chunk of humanity and subsequently themselves.

As long as there is some type of Bitcoin economy, even if it's only dark net markets, the price will remain above 0.

@_date: 2016-03-11 12:33:38
Bitcoin is resilient to a hostile takeover, this could be exploited to prevent anyone from being able to ever get a consensus on the block size increasing. 
Bitcoin adoption continues to grow and higher fees (but still low relative to everything else) become the new normal. As fees get high 2nd layer solutions look more promising, but no major solutions beyond just sending off chain transactions in the next 6 months. Lots more talk about lightning network.

Hah, my girlfriend finally started to understand why I was so excited about Bitcoin when we were tripping on MDMA together. I was finally able to communicate why it was so revolutionary. After that she started to call me sugar daddy Peter, affectionately / half joking. We're legitimately polyamorous though so being filthy rich might actually up my game (for all the wrong reasons.)
My point is that I hope a Bitcoin revolution doesn't just end up being an aristocracy with early bitcoiners being arrogant about their "success."

Bitcoin is something that could potentially shift the balance of world power. The United States in leading the pack in terms of investment, but I don't think that you'll lead the world in how it is regulated. If you push innovation out of the country through regulation you are only postponing the inevitable and letting this country lag behind.

Still a central bank, still counter party risk. Democratic leadership doesn't create perfect leaders, a democratic bank won't be able to create a perfect central bank. Why is it such a popular idea to manipulate free markets anyway? I can understand breaking up monopolies but using a central bank to control interest rates and monetary supply for short term stability is going to catch up to us. It's already showing serious cracks. The Fed changes the tone of its language and rocks the entire stock market. That's not very efficient.

Coinbase.com and link your bank account to purchase or you can use Circle.com if you want to buy with a Debit/CC. Both work in Europe and US not sure otherwise, but buy some coin and send it to cold storage (leave these coins alone for as long as you can). Get Breadwallet for iOS or Mycelium for Android and beam some coins to your phone. Tell a friend and get them to download Breadwallet or Mycelium. Send them $1-$5 and to get a feel for a transaction and possibly peak their interest. Check out coinmap.com to support a local business that accepts BTC and pay with your phone. Check out regularly because everyday is crazy different.

If Satoshi started moving his coins around Litecoin (or some other coin) would probably see a surge in price, because it's not premined in the way bitcoin is.

Hillary will be the same path as Obama and bail out Wall Street in a hartbeat the next economic downturn, take more liberty in exchange for "security". Bernie might be the next Obama-esque disappointment, but at least he's talking about make people's lives better as opposed to make the lives of the undeserving worse.

As nice as it would be to spend Bitcoin in ways that are familiar (handing cash, swiping a card) it's always more practical to beam from computer to computer / phone to phone.

Things will get better, in fact they're already pretty damn good depending on how long you've been paying attention. It's an emotional market but even a 20% price drop in a day doesn't mean adoption is slowing. Historically it has just meant that the price has gotten ahead of itself and needs time to cool off.

He's wrong. Adoption and liquidity will solve the problem. Gold backed currency worked as money, why not inherently limited digital assets?
Volatility is only a problem with low adoption, as adoption increases volatility decreases. Volatility is *slowing down* adoption but Bitcoin is here to stay and developers continue to find reasons for adoption. 
Considering he's been working on an altcoin I don't know why anyone should be surprised he doesn't think bitcoin is going to make it.

Issue altcoins and force people to mine with CPUs? It makes no sense, it would be a billion times easier to attack this hypothetical network than the bitcoin network.


If you have unlimited altcoins then the units of transfer are no longer limited.. so they will have no value. If you have no value you have no incentive for mining.

Block halving, for one. Uncencorable transactions are always going to have value for people.

I don't think growth is coming from new people using Bitcoin to buy coffee with on chain transactions.

If by buy/sell you mean day trade then don't bother trying to outsmart / time the market. Just buy and hold. 
Beyond that thought you're doing it right. Coinbase is easy to use, $100 is a reasonable bet for most people. If you start accumulating more start looking into cold storage and properly securing your own funds with something like a trezor / ledger wallet. Don't put all your eggs in one basket.

There's a nice 6 month trend line we just bounced off of with some monentum. Also volatility like this is why I think the halving has not yet been price in. Plus people haven't taken into consideration how increased transactions on the network is probably the most important indicator of the health of Bitcoin (ironically) and the price has not reflected this growth for several years.
You got to be an independent thinker to be excited about Bitcoin and yet the community still has an emotional herd mentality. Something's got to give price wise with a decrease in supply and ever increasing demand.

1. Blocks are not currently full

Bitcoin will not implode if the fee goes up. Before it implodes the market will reach an equilibrium showing just how much Bitcoin transactions are worth at 3tps, and that is okay.

Step 1: create infighting and drama to make Bitcoin appear in distress 
Step 2: herd people who think Bitcoin is imploding to a different sub
Step 3: promote / pump alternative to Bitcoin in alternative sub 
Step 4: pump altcoin 
I think people buying ether on emotion will get fucked by the market. It has no cap, inflation forever is on par with fiat over the long term. It's got some nice features that Bitcoin can bolt on top though.

There have been attacks like that before and the attacker loses several thousand dollars and people learn about what a fee market means. There's diminishing returns to an attack like that and it only lights a fire under the ass of people working on solutions. Bitcoin isn't dead, again. Some people just shouldn't have invested if they can't stomach a 10% drop. It happens.

This last attack was a psychological one. Bitcoin isn't going to implode, wallets will adapt, 2nd later solutions will adapt, block size will adapt. People who bought alts on emotion are going to kick themselves when they get burned. That's what markets do.

I appreciate the thoughtful response to my snarky reply. 
The lack of Bitcoin not crashing despite etherium rallying to me is very telling. Cypto as a market would appear to be growing. I think the same spam attack from last week is related to the puppet accounts flooding users with posts about etherium and the subsequent recent rally in etherium. There are some entities with deep pockets who would love to rock the boat. Bitcoin clearly hasn't died after dipping from that spike from $1200 and with a block halving right around the corner its high time to stir up some trouble. There's a part of me that wants to diversify into ether so I can sleep at night, but there's a bigger part of me that's glad it never touched dogecoin or litecoin when similar drama was stirred up. Buy Bitcoin and hold. It's deceptively difficult to do, as you would expect a market to conjure for its potential reward. 
@_date: 2016-03-12 15:23:04
Is 4 cents during an attack really so disruptive? It mostly just pointed out wallets need to push updates for dynamic fee. Bitcoin emerged stronger. There's a pattern of that.

In the short term, maybe. Projects like reddit notes will make this statement true.

Is Bitcoin currently so expensive that you can't afford to send a transaction? Is it really so prohibitively expensive to you that you can only afford off chain transactions that later get settled?
There is a psychological attack against Bitcoin going on recently. The network is fine, it's the people that are getting manipulated.

Well with fiat you're guaranteed it's going to lose value over time.

Bitcoin has 6 times the market cap and is inherently limited, so no. Panic buying altcoins has historically been a bad idea. We've seen this with dogecoin, litecoin, now etherium.

He's saying that bitcoin's popularity will lead to its demise. Game theory doesn't really work that way, an equilibrium will be reached before the whole thing blows up. People think the price of transactions will spike to $5 if the market price of Bitcoin takes off then no one will ever use Bitcoin again and the value will crash to 0. I'm pretty sure the value and number of transactions going up is unambiguously good. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 15:55:51

He did a great bigthink talk and is very much a Bitcoin supporter / CEO of Xapo. How people can't understand bitcoin's impact on payments aren't paying attention to PayPal's stance. And honestly that part is less exciting than how it might turn out to be a better storage of value than gold. 
@_date: 2016-01-01 20:22:08
Off chain transactions probably also pretty easy to track if you're the government. Point is it's worse for terrorism than cash.

Everything is always a bigger concern. People were concerned about ethereum taking over, the halving, MMM ponzi, blocks filling, a fee market, now splitting the coin. Every time these things don't break Bitcoin and it proves to be antifragile, the price goes higher.

The cool thing about this rally is it doesn't feel like a panic rally yet. We were due for a big move and the breakout is apparently supposed to be up. We need a bit more time in this rally and then the media to throw some gas on the fire. Then things start getting euphoric.

If you think inflation falling from 8% to 4% overnight is not significant because of the volume of trades then you are confused. Supply is being reduced. If demand stays the same we have a higher price. If demand increases we go parabolic.

Rather than try to day trade or time the market of when to buy, if you're interested in Bitcoin the best thing to do is buy and hold long term. Central banks and governments have extremely deep pockets and Bitcoin only has a $10 billion market cap so it would be very easy for a central bank or government to dramtically increase the value of Bitcoin if they bought and held.

It works both ways, sometimes the price goes up. Actually, it goes up more often than not. You can get an instant purchase but you will pay a higher fee. You've worked in banking, sometimes banks fuck people with confusing rules. Also as for the volatility, welcome to Bitcoin motherfucker.
@_date: 2017-01-12 00:16:43
Bigger attack vector for one. More coins makes the total number of coins in crypto infinite which kind of makes them worthless, when it's even doubtful that these coins can contribute anything of value that Bitcoin can't do.

@_date: 2016-06-25 02:37:48
I'll take this one: 
It's doesn't make sense to call out swings in dollar value because if you want to talk about bits (or 1/1,000,000 of a BTC) things only swing by pennies. Percentages make much more sense.
As a percentage your dollars will sure as shit lose 2% this year. Meanwhile Bitcoin had gained value 6 out of the last 7 years, several of those years more than 1000%, which is actually hard for most people to comprehend. It moved 15% after the brexit while gold moved 5%.
Amazing that anyone that thinks an asset that is going to lose 2% this year (pick any fiat currency) is superior.
@_date: 2016-06-12 19:44:09
I'd add to this to buy in small increments over time. You're much better off buying $20 every week for 5 weeks than $100 all at once. If you try to time the market the market will most likely fool you.

All these banks who are saying blockchains are the future but Bitcoin doesn't matter will have to reevaluate their stance.
@_date: 2016-06-02 18:57:49
Imagine the media coverage if we have an actual Bitcoin bubble? A 20% move is historically not a big deal to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-07 23:16:15
How can something that will lose (at least) 2-3% of its value every year be a good thing to hold? Surely the market won't choose that. 
I also think bitcoin is wildly undervalued at ~$15 billion (major currencies are valued in the trillions). This leads to volatility on the way up, but if it's large and stable why would anyone hold the inflationary currency over the deflationary alternative? 
So I'm holding for an early retirement, or to watch a crazy experiment rollercoaster into the ground. Not selling.

To what amount? And I imagine that process could get quite messy. Plus if an individual gets their account hacked that is not insured.  
Also, coinbase is much more likely to get hacked than an individual with a hardware wallet. It's a much bigger target.
Also hardware wallets are fairly straightforward.

Number 1: trading Bitcoin is a bad idea. The market will magically take money from you. Just buy and hold coins long term. 
Number 2: the fees will eat away at your profits (if you by some miracle have any profits). 
Number 3: Large amounts of Bitcoin are a bad idea to keep on coinbase because it's on the internet, and could get hacked. 
Number 4: Also, because as Satoshi himself said, "if you don't control your capital it isn't your capital anymore." (For example during the split in the coin 2 weeks ago coinbase users were unable to move their BCH.)
Keep coins in your own cold storage / hardware wallet if you have a lot of money. Don't try to day trade.

And as the price starts rising, they need to sell less and less coins (as a percentage of coins mined) to cover costs, locking up more supply, causing the price to rise even further. 
There's a hype cycle, there's a mining cycle, and the supply halves at timed intervals. Expect more manias until ultimately there's a financial enlightenment.

Still, it is young and risky, don't invest more than you can afford to lose, it could one day go to 0. But if it's around in 20 years I can almost guarentee it's doing better than the US dollar.

The price is affected by the rate of new coins entering the market, less so the total that will ever exist. If all anyone care about was the eventual total, no one would hold fiat because it's trending toward infinite supply. Clearly the rate of inflation is more relevant.

The invention of Bitcoin was *the* quantum leap to digital scarcity. You can now have finite digital "things" (Bitcoin tokens) that can't just be copied at will.
Incremental changes marketed as new and improved blockchains don't really matter in my opinion. They're copies. You can add bells and whistles and fool investors for a while, but a copy of digital scarcity isn't scarce. It doesn't matter. There's a long tail of shitcoins out there. They're a non-invention with bells and whistles that can drum up value and support because this is still the Wild West of the investment world.
Bitcoin *is* the blockchain. Everything else right now is just a test bed with window dressing.

If it was true that miners updated the code, not users and the market, Segwit2X would have been implemented (and also would have immediately imploded). 
Miners have no political power in this. And that’s a massively good thing. It means the power to update the code won’t be centralized to large  mining farms, but rather to users and to the market. 


This is seemingly minor, but fundamentally wrong.

Right but with Bitcoin you don't have to put it in an interest bearing account and gamble a loan on your currency in order for it to gain value. Instead the currency itself gains value as the economy grows. Your slice of the overall pie stays the same as the value of the pie increases, rather than your slice getting smaller and smaller as the pie increases as with fiat.
It amazes me that people think inflation is good for them. Your money loses value every year. It's really simple, that's a hidden tax that you have to increase your risk in order to avoid.

Exactly. As the price rises miners need to sell fewer coins to pay bills, which tightens the market, raising the price higher, fewer coins need to be sold, etc, etc. There’s a positive feedback loop when the price starts rising. 
Eventually somethings gotta give and it crashes and finds an equilibrium.

Without the currency there is no incentive to mine so it wouldn't have nearly the same security as the Bitcoin blockchain. It might be possible to create, in fact there are alt coins out there that exist using different methods, but my money is betting on the free market using the most secure (and well known) blockchain, Bitcoin. 
If the currency aspect of Bitcoin fails (unlikely IMO) then blockchains will not be very trustworthy, which will defeat the purpose of blockchains. No currency, no useful blockchain.

Sure but the only argument against failing fiat was going back to a gold standard with some new currency with some new counterparty who would probably just debase it again. It was all top down, everything bottom up was squashed because it was centralized.

This means less downward pressure from miners selling BTC to pay expenses.

I had an evangelist phase at first. It's lonely being the *only* person you know who "gets it" and is excited. I would talk a mile a minute because it felt like a very important thing to talk about (possibly the most important). Yet it would be way easier to start a conversation about Kim Kardashian. 
Once a few people around me started to "get it" I felt a big sense of releif. Probably my brain saying, "okay, you're probably not turning psychitzophrenic."  Now I only mention it if anyone asks, which is surprisingly often. Some of those seeds I planted in 2013/2014 are finally starting to grow.

A drop is supply to miners kind of works like compound interest on the OTC market and exchanges. Miners selling coins directly to big buyers are drying up and there is less downward pressure on exchanges from miners selling. Everyday that goes by it compounds on the previous day's supply shortage. If you look at a chart from the last halving you see a delay of about 6 weeks then a massive rally.

Didn't watch the video yet but I'm not sure how this is possible. If they own a significant percentage of Bitcoin in existence (say even 1%) and they get hacked... how do they buy that back to guarentee deposits without the market slipping up?
Also (sort of an aside) what if the government does a 180 "for national security" during an economic crisis / Bitcoin rally and starts raiding these online wallets?
@_date: 2016-09-04 16:36:43
Deflect and call me a child. This is officially going nowhere. 
But it's good that you think I'm using Bitcoin to buy drugs. You're validating my point that you have a skewed view of reality. You think everyone on purse is carding, everyone on LBC is laundering and everyone buying Bitcoin is just trying to buy drugs. How noble of you to spend time on saving us from ourselves!

And they could have saved time and money realizing this sub has been saying they don't need a blockchain for the last 12 months. They are talking about a shared ledger. They need a trusted 3rd party, that's about it.

If you could predict the market's movement even 51% of the time you could be a professional day trader. Most people will get burned by the market. Don't bother trying to time it.

Hold coins. Spend *through* Bitcoin.
Buy what you need and spend it if you want to support the ecosystem in this way. Personally the main reason I'm interested in Bitcoin is that historically it's a wildly better store of value than cash over the long term. Call me a speculator, it's money I can afford to lose, but your return on cash sucks guaranteed and Bitcoin seemingly isn't going away, and every year it doesn't go away reenforces the rise in price.

Right, so snarky comments aside, your example  people are willing to pay a premium for Bitcoin if they don't have a bank account. That's one example of someone who might use purse (and likely the majority of users buying on their site). The other thing is if you have an amazon gift card attached to your account there's no way to sell it. You have to spend it. Purse is a solution to this problem.
No use arguing though. You're here on to talk about how you don't like Bitcoin. To each his own I guess.
@_date: 2016-09-05 16:22:08

I have saved hundreds of dollars on purse and paid negligible fees. 20% discount off of Amazon and you're worrying about 1% fee to purchase on coinbase, and literally no transaction fee to transfer to purse when accounts are linked?

Bitcoin reached parity with USD in 2011. Four years later it's 250X higher and has a ton of potential room for growth.

Enough people believe it to be the way the market moves so that *it actually is the way the market moves*. There are levels of support and resistance that are real because *enough people believe that they're real*. It's the breakouts that are harder to predict.

Bitcoin is controversial. You can't talk about changing money without people getting emotional. 
If this is an honest post, which I'm skeptical of, you should know when and where it's okay to talk about something politically entrenched, especially when the masses know little to nothing about what Bitcoin is. No need to convert some drunk dude into a believer. Move on, the right minds will gravitate to Bitcoin on their own.

My first Bitcoin was $112 and I bought when it had already been up over 10x (1,000%) on the year. Considering we are still double that number the growth over the last couple years is worth stomaching the volatility and a (16 month?)bear trend. 
The biggest problem in the perception of the price is that mainstream journalists first started paying attention at $1200. From their perspective it's down. When / if we reach a new ATH things could get very dramatic very quickly. 
@_date: 2016-10-18 11:56:33

The price peaked above $1000 with almost none of that. A 60X (6,000%) move higher in one year (2013) while the media and economists laughed about it.

A 10 fold increase in adoption since February in a country with hyperinflation - where food prices are going parabolic and people are starving - is noteworthy that these people value Bitcoin.

Actually, unlike stocks there's no need to ever sell, necessarily. For example, you can instead spend it and save 20% on anything on Amazon using purse.io. Or spend it on newegg or overstock. And unlike Apple or Google stock there's a set limit to the number of bitcoins that will ever exist. I recommend holding on long term for an early retirement.

It won't seem like a fad when governments are bailing out banks again during another financial crisis.

Going to read this book now, thanks for sharing.
I think we're obviously in the midst of a monetary revolution and if that's true then the social implications are going to be absurdly far reaching. I don't know that most people think about what it means for bitcoin to "go mainstream." That implies fundamentally altering capitalism and with it fundamentally changing society. 
I have a sneaking suspension that bitcoin might usher in a renaissance similar to how banking did in the 1400's, only this time the world is obviously much more global and changes happen much faster. A renaissance might free up space in people's lives to think spiritually again, not necessarily religiously, but perhaps continue exploring the state of mind that cause a cultural revolution in the late 60's that was squashed by the government when the youth started protesting the war. 
To me, bitcoin's potential to change capitalism and improve people's lives is the cure to our current money-worshiping soul-sucking consumer culture, and possibly a transition to something much better. Time will tell if I'm a nutter or not I guess.

Bank bail out after bank bail out. There's also clearly demand to have an alternative to central bank issued currency. Also there's been people trying to create a purely digital currency for decades. They all got squashed by the government, so Bitcoin is decentralized like BitTorrent vs early attempts that were all centralized like napster.

If we have the same demand and a reduced supply you can be pretty damn sure the price will rise as a result.

For what investors? Stocks? Currency traders? Commodity traders? Cypto has a short history and to ignore the past 4 similar bubbles is IMO kind of odd don't you think? 
All I see is increasing demand over time which I think will continue and decreasing supply which I know will continue. It's a volatile market so I know it could swing low in the short term but I see a lot of reasons demand is going to increase in the long term. 
I think you're still stuck on the intrinsic value piece if you think the price is going to trend to 0. Money is a ledger and Bitcoin is a significantly better ledger than fiat. Mainly because you can basically email money for practically free and governments cant create it out of thing air.

If they could achieve consensus and mine 23 million why not 24 million? Or 35 million?

Few are likely to go through the laborious process of undertaking the above calculations every time they wish to make a transaction. Many, therefore, are opting in for a much higher fee of 150 satoshis per byte or 35 cents per average transaction.

I think what bitcoin is calling out is that all money is a ledger, and basically just information. Bitcoin, gold and dollars are just ways of expressing relative wealth. Can you make a paper dollar necklace or wedding ring? Didn't think so. The intrinsic value of being able to make a gold ring does nothing to justify the spot price, it's the history of its use as a ledger that makes gold so valued. I have a feeling over time people are going to start to realize this and also realize that having an open ledger where you can prove reserves / move value instantly is really valuable.

I think the biggest point that he is missing here is when he keeps saying *the only reason* people are buying Bitcoin is because they think the price will rise.... When, in fact, some people will buy in at any price in order to *use* Bitcoin to move money cheaply. Like using bitcoin for remittances for example, the price is irrelevant, you could buy a piece of a $300 bitcoin (or $1,000,000 bitcoin for that matter), move it, then sell it.
Meanwhile people are locking up liquidity (holding) because they know people will buy in and use Bitcoin at any price. That's why there is a history of these bubbles, and will probably continue to be bubbles as adoption of legitimate uses continue. There is real demand, and a whole bunch of people seeing that demand and locking up liquidity which drives the price up. Can't wait for the next block halving...

Mining profit should not approach 0 because of fees per block. Also fees per block should should not plateau (I think). Plus mining reward started at 50, not 100.

You *worked for a company* that moved the money. I'm sure the overhead cost associated with moving that money was actually really high (orders of magnitude more than bitcoin) just not applied to that transaction. 
Also, bitcoin could theoretically be insured in the same way that the bank transfer was insured. 
Hard to tell what direction this is going in but secret investments will probably get lost in the noise if there are millions of transactions a day.

**So to answer your question** the significance of the market cap is that **it's a barometer of the sentiment of people hoarding coins**, really. If you got in early on, $250+/btc might be pretty attractive to live off of / invest in startups who need USD. But with all the news recently, attention from banks / just general trajectory, my sentiments are pretty f****** high. Much higher than $250... but if it quickly hit $30,000 a coin it would be temping to sell one and live off of / invest in startups that need (increasingly less) USD.

Bitcoin was created first so it has the longest history, most developers and is the most reviewed code. It has the highest market cap, so it has the highest network hash rate. It also has the highest liquidity and lowest volatility. It has the network effect of being accepted at more places and held by more people than other cryptos and has more venture capital money for startups. 
It's fairly entrenched. Most other cryptos I think of as experiments that could be added to Bitcoin and also exist to keep Bitcoin development in check.

It doubled in market cap over the last year [transactions on the network]( keep increasing, not sure why this guy is patting himself on the back for his prediction. Supply halving incoming in 50 days. 
Unless the banks can scramble to disrupt the momentum the idea of a currency that has ever reducing inflation is going to start to peak the interest of anyone who is trying to accumulate money. Which is as far as I can tell is everyone.

There's no central authority in Bitcoin for the government to step on. If they could shut it down they would have years ago. This is the first time we've had a choice in currency in a very long time. And the kicker is it's deflationary rather than inflationary. That's what will fuel this revolution. Economists are so sure that inflating savings away is good and what people should want. By that logic you would expect bitcoins block halving to be bearish, but the sentiment around the halving could not be more bullish.

Save bitaddress.org to a USB drive. 
Run a secure OS offline and use the bitadress.org file on your USB to generate some wallets. There is an option to generated encrypted wallets which I would recommend using. 
Load up the wallets with Bitcoin and save the file to a couple different USB drives and keep them in a couple of different safe places.
You can play around with small amounts to get comfortable loading / sweeping wallets. Don't reload significant amounts to a wallet you've already swept / consider a swept wallet no longer secure. 
Or just buy a Trezor if it's not worth the hassle to you.

A dozen coders on the core and tens of thousands working on startups / hobbiests tinkering and creating. Plus $500,000,000 in VC money and growing quickly 
The way it's going to grow is another mania / bubble created first by steady growth from remitances and other legitimate demand then the media pouring fuel on the fire. There's also a halving within 2 years.

Considering the volatility has been decreasing over time, not really. I still think large entities look at bitcoin and don't consider it a threat *because* it's so small. They're not scare so they're not trying to manipulate the market. I could be wrong though.


It doesn't work that way. Buying up a significant percentage of bitcoin would cause the price to increase substantially. Also I'm not planning on selling for mine for dollars, and there are others with that mind set.

If more people are "spending through" Bitcoin for things like remittances you would expect the price to rise because of increased demand. As an investor hoarding coins the market cap is very significant. The more the liquidity in the market dries up from people holding, the sooner people take a second look wondering why Bitcoin is taking off again. It's not a ponzi, it's a revolution.

Good luck with that. Bitcoin's volatility won't be an issue if it has a trillion dollar + market cap, which is like $70,000 a coin, which for all this main stream adoption talk is absolutely possible. I can't see the price going from $1,000 to $70,000 without fiat folding like.. *well*.. paper.

You're focusing very much on a *potential* negative that I personally think is irrational.

If you think about this historically it's been in the blink of an eye. Six years is an insanely short amount of time for this kind of organic growth, I have to keep reminding myself. I agree with you, any day now. There's a backlog of progress that hasn't been realized in the price and it tends to happen in bursts, not steady growth. US government is running out of coins to flood the market with and there's a halving around the corner. Price seems low to me and if it explodes this time that many more people are paying attention, could very easily turn into a mania. 
It's funny, I'm overall more optimistic with a price at $~280 in a relative bull market than $~400 in a bear market. Is Bitcoin unique or is that just psychology?

You'd have to run the numbers to know for sure. It's one thing to be not profitable buying electricity from the grid. It's another to generate your own electricity and mine with renewable energy. It seems like this type of mining would be a threat to anyone mining with electricity from the grid.

If people can opt out of a currency if they don't agree with it the military is irrelevant. Also Bitcoin is legal in the US and most of the world.

It's not wasting huge amounts of energy, it's securing the network. If we want a decentralized monetary system it needs to be rock solid so no one can attack it. Otherwise no one will trust that monetary system. 
As for generating CO2, now that miners have hit a wall with chip manufacturering, their industry is focusing on the cheapest energy sources. This is pushing miners to using renewable energy.

I understand what your getting at. There is a feedback mechanism where Bitcoin over the long term has made Bitcoin investors / enthusiast rich which gives them a further reach to promote and build it out even further. Roger Ver comes to mind. 
But think about it, mining costs an insane amount of money to secure the network, right? But all of that money is going right into the pockets of people who are some of the most passionate about Bitcoin. Watching bitcoin "turn on" and unfold is amazing.

Bitcoin *is* your investment.
If Bitcoin itself isn't risky enough for you then look into Ultra-Coin (It's not an altcoin, it's an unfortunately named trading platform using Bitcoin.) It's quite new but I think you can invest in stocks using your Bitcoin somehow.. The only problem that I see (and it's a pretty major problem) is the extra counter party risk involved. 
Personally I'm just hanging onto my bitcoins and either going down with the ship, flying to the moon, or biting my nails for the rest of my life. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:07:55
I think there is little risk to a network split but there will be lots of hyperbolie like when people were panicking about the block halving last year.

Bitcoin grinding to a halt and imploding because miners jump ship and mine an alt would be bad for cryptocurecy in general. I think there are too many question marks around even the leading alt for it to be easy to migrate their business model without considering mining at a loss to protect their longer term investment (miners obviously hold Bitcoin and would be unlikely to panic dump their investment and rock the whole crypto boat)
Also, and probably more importantly, **if miners migrate en mass to an alt then they're still going to have to operate at a loss.** There is only so much mining revenue to be had in crypto in general, and **pretty soon there is going to be a massive excess in hashing power relative to total crypto value that can be mined.** Other Cyptos will probably get a boost in hashing power but miners will still chew through those 2000 blocks.
It very well *might* be rocky and the media generally isn't on our side, but I don't think Bitcoin will blow up like you think it will. I'll keep hodling. I think there are enough others out there who would agree. Plus the psychology around inflation being cut in half will probably generate enough new interest to offset any weak hands that are invested around this time.

I need to read up on derivatives more.

Exactly. Bitcoin is in perpetual crisis. As soon as one crisis gets averted we have another. I think eventually this will not be the case but bitcoin's still got some growing up to do.

See this is where we disagree. There is no such thing as a healthy inflationary economy, just boom times until bust. An inflationary economy is a manipulated economy. You can *potentially* make more money because you're taking on more risk. 
@_date: 2015-02-17 23:05:27
Not to mention the potential growth that we could see in the third world.
If we have a global deflationary currency you're going to see less investments in consumer products in the first world and more investment in basic needs being met in the third world. If we have a common currency that grows in value as the world economy grows, investing in *needs* is going to start to make more sense than investing in *wants*. 
It's going to become trivially easy for super wealthy philanthropists to seed economies by spreading bitcoin while at the same time taking some of the wind out of consumer culture by encouraging saving.

Can't Ethereum be ported into Bitcoin? To me this is why it isn't a threat, Bitcoin already has the liquidity and network effects that will take a long while for Ethereum to build up, and if it's a good idea it could just be adopted. What's the rush to beat Ethereum to the punch? They're the smaller riskier crypto and if altcoins serve any purpose it's to push the limits of cryptocurrency and risk breaking so Bitcoin doesn't have to. 
Also curious what's the difference between colored coins / counterparty / smart contracts?

It's the only way to send money electronically if you want to eliminate counter party risk. And it's also really cheap and quick to do.

If they have Bitcoin reserves or not. 
When you use changetip you are making off blockchain transactions but they are holding the Bitcoin that is represented in the transaction.

What was centralized? The solution was created by a group, the agreement was a meeting that was a group and the miners who implemented it were a group of individual entrepreneurs. There is no actual hiarchy or invite or bearocracy. It was purely the best developers coming up with an idea that was implemented by the miners (who's votes were weighted by the most successful business / most hash power).
That's how all Bitcoin upgrades work, this one has just been increadibly polically charged and everyone had an opinion on the thing.

Scarcity is fundamental to bitcoin having any value.. and value is necessary for decentralized security (mining). How many units are there when there are altcoins that are equally valid? How are altcoins protected from attack if mining them doesn't produce a return?
The competition on the side is great for bitcoin in a Darwinian way but ultimately you need scarcity to have value. 
@_date: 2015-02-23 22:36:44

I would imagine if Satoshi was sitting on $1,000,000 in BTC they probably had the foresight to see it might be worth more in the future. Also really strange to abandon $1,000,000 because you're already so rich. 
My point is unless there's proof they can't be spent, I would assume it's quite likely they *can* be spent. But I don't think these coins will be spent until Bitcoin has matured even further, otherwise moving these coins at this point would spook the market. 
@_date: 2015-02-14 17:11:30

This is the closest thing I've seen the Motley Fool do to a neutral piece on bitcoin. They've been some of the worst in terms of denouncing it as a fad / ponzi scheme. I guess you can only write it off so many times before you have to actually figure out what the buzz is about.

I don't think $200 to $600 is that unreasonable for growth considering its history / that for all its potential it's valued at $10billion. 
Respectable brokerages also completely missed Bitcoin going from $0 to $1000, and then laughed it, only now taking a second look because it tripped after they wrote it off.

Why bother with a blockchain then? The whole point of a blockchain is that you don't need to trust one another. 


Exactly. It's not even a blockchain at that point. It's a shared database. It'll be secure if everyone trusts eachother but will be a walled garden walled off from any innovation. Not sure how that's going to compete long term with a free and open no trust required blockchain.

Exactly! You put the conclusion more succinctly than me, but that's what I'm excited about. As a percentage, the amount of adoption that needs to take place for a rise in price is smaller and smaller.

It needs to succeed as a trusted commodity first, but this is an evolution. Yea, it'd be cool to buy pizza and coffee with, but is also entirely unnessary, and honestly less convenient than visa. What's more exciting to me is that it's value you actually control 100% and isn't inflated away like government currency in a bank account. 
If Bitcoin succeeds as a multi trillion dollar commodity, who the hell would want to hold government currency? So personally, I'm taking the risk to bootstrap this thing. Second layer solutions will come in time, the answer certainly isn't dogecoin.

It doesn't matter if you don't understand or believe in technical analysis. There are patterns and there are people who buy into those patterns which create self fulfilling prophecies.

The thing about Bitcoin is that you have the choice to use their service or not. People are free to decide if they want to hold their coins or have a trusted custodian. 
If you're new to Bitcoin and don't really understand it trusting coinbase makes a lot more sense than trying to airgap a computer to generate paper wallets.
@_date: 2016-07-01 00:36:31
Nope. You're misunderstanding. Coinbase makes a lot of transactions to purse but rather than actually using the blockchain for every transaction they can (or already do) just send receipts / share books that balance then make one on-chain transaction hourly or daily to settle the books.
That would be Bitcoin being used as a settlement layer, and I'm sure it's already happening for better or worse.

It doesn't really get to the point I'm trying to make though (admittedly with little information) but don't derivatives markets work on reserves.

Unnecessary. This situation is already increadibly unlikely because miners have an incentive to not trash the value of Bitcoin. And look what happened when everyone was worried about the hash rate at the halving... Miners stopped selling coins to buy new equipment and the price basically doubled.
@_date: 2016-07-24 23:53:51
So the Bitcoin was bought with cash directly from that dark market and the sale was internal and the seller also kept the coins on that dark market? 
Pretty sure there is some movement on the blockchain associated with the sale that could connect to the purchase.

It's not that all the depositors are going to withdraw all their money with negative interest rates into Bitcoin. It's that this is something that incentivizes risk taking for people with large amounts of cash. A small amount of Bitcoin as cash might not be a bad idea for these people.

I believe if you didn't claim your changetip within a certain time frame they were sent back to the sender. Lots of people would be up 10X or more on tips from when this was popular.

Which is weird because the Silk Road reduced crime.

Dogecoin had an increadible run.

God damn it... the top has been called, folks.

You must be shorting bitcoin with everything you've got! Good luck to you!
@_date: 2016-07-02 19:58:22
Lots of name calling. I've been downvoted to oblivion for saying optimistic things about bitcoin. I agree that censorship is not ideal, but I think the alternative of letting trolls run wild is much worse.

Move fast and break things I guess.

The tax rules incentivize hodling. There's only a tax event if you sell or spend. Fuck selling. 
@_date: 2016-07-08 16:53:45
I think going from 8% inflation to 4% might have a larger effect on the price than going from 30% to 15%. Bitcoin only needs 4% adoption per year either through more hodling or more new users. That's way easier to achieve than 15%.
Bitcoin will trend toward $infinity or $0 over the long term.

I'll have a go at it:


For some reason journalist think bitcoin was created at the end of 2013 at the exact moment of it's all time high. The price is declining relative to the all time high, but has performed insanely well over the longer term. Like, mindbogglingly well. It traded for $13 two years ago. That is obviously relevant information that the journalist either omitted to prove his point, or was genuinely ignorant of. 


Mining doesn't drive the price of bitcoin, the price of bitcoin drives mining. So the short term profitability of mining has little to do with bitcoin's long term viability. Mining companies might fail and the hash rate might drop, but mining will still function exactly as planned.


It's made it this far with no consumer protection and companies like Coinbase and Circle are starting to bridge the gap. In the meantime Trezor and Ledgerwallet are making securing your own bitcoins considerably easier.


You have to start somewhere. Saying it doesn't have enough users so it will never have enough users isn't the best logic considering there is a clear trend of growth. This has been an entirely decentralized grassroots movement it's amazing how popular it has gotten so quickly. 


Seems like the only metric the author can understand is the exchange rate from late 2013 to today. It obviously doesn't look good if you're only passively paying attention but to not see the momentum under bitcoin, especially as a journalist, shows a lack of insight,

Bitcoin always has a boogie man and is in perpetual crisis, and yet doesn't give a fuck. Hodl.
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:50:49
Yea, although incidentally a lot of the concepts were implemented in Szabos "bitgold." Plus this quote comes to mind:
"As a thought experiment, imagine there was a base metal as scarce as gold but with the following properties: - boring grey in colour - not a good conductor of electricity - not particularly strong, but not ductile or easily malleable either - not useful for any practical or ornamental purpose and one special, magical property: - can be transported over a communications channel If it somehow acquired any value at all for whatever reason, then anyone wanting to transfer wealth over a long distance could buy some, transmit it, and have the recipient sell it." - Satoshi Nakamoto

Bitcoin is weird though. Purse seems legit and you can save 20%
@_date: 2017-06-08 12:03:10
ETH transactions are already up to $1 and rising just as rapidly as Bitcoin. Larger blocks might buy us a few months. That's about it. 
@_date: 2016-07-11 20:09:39
The last rally broke when mt gox failed. I think it will take something major breaking to stop this next rally. I trust coinbase to hold my coins, what I don't trust is the government and the control they have over coinbase.

Better ban fiat

Don't invest more than you can afford to lose. Other than that, great!

Right, and the whales want stability, not dogecoin roulette with nearly free transactions.

It's old news that he's way excited about Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-07-25 00:15:19
Good point. You'd need to see the dark market's books to actually see the sale. Which you could imagine their books leaking from time to time perhaps, or government breaking in. 
Anyway, cash is still more anonymous, but I suppose the blockchain did not fight crime nessisarily in this case. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 15:43:39
For all their technical difficulties and growing pains, coinbase is still the best exchange for new people. Simple UI and relatively low fees. The problem is when people try to day trade or just leave tens of thousands of dollars in their coinbase account not realizing that's a bad idea. 
@_date: 2017-06-28 10:54:17
They're advertising for cryptocurrencies but somehow don't realize it yet.

A small enough minority will be able to call him out on it that he'll get away with it. Welcome the world of journalism to the hive mind of the Internet.

Um, good news doesn't hurt. It fulfills a trend. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 23:54:26


There's the Achilles heel. 
@_date: 2017-06-28 16:39:56
A couple of the pitfalls that people can't wrap their heads around is if you have a trusted 3rd party, you don't need a blockchain, and if it doesn't have a token of value (making it a cryptocurrency) it isn't a blockchain. 
Correct me if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2017-06-26 01:53:38
@_date: 2017-06-29 00:56:42


A private blockchain implies a trusted party watching over the thing. Not sure how there could be semi trusted scenarios where only a few bad actors could be tolerated. Sounds like a shaky foundation. I don't doubt it, but it also doesn't sound nearly as useful as a blockchain that does not require a trusted third party trying to mitigate some of their trust to a blockchain.
Also, is there an example of this? Has it been succefully implemented? Seems like crypto is the only successful implementation of a blockchain. Lots of vaporware out there.
@_date: 2017-06-28 16:44:51
It's amazing how fast the market forgot about that. It was very recent and like 10% of all ether if I'm not mistaken.

The trolls! They're dying! (I'm just kidding you're not a troll)

Word is they're strapped for Bitcoin lately. Eventually people are going to have to bid up the price.

If ETH overtakes Bitcoin I wonder what will overtake ETH.
@_date: 2015-02-01 13:55:31
This would drive me insane
@_date: 2017-06-08 11:56:38
No, the solution is ETH where average transaction fee is $1.
@_date: 2017-06-02 13:20:39
It doesn't have a problem. When Bitcoin corrected 20% recently ETH corrected 50%. If that's not a warning shot to alt investors, good luck to you. Bitcoin is digital gold, not PayPal 2.0. The fact that it's so difficult to change means it's going to be impossible to attack. 
@_date: 2016-07-26 16:08:03
It's called the Internet. There's no taxes, it's everywhere and nowhere at the same time, no one is in charge but everyone is in charge, all users have equal say, etc, etc. Oh yea, and the national currency is Bitcoin.
