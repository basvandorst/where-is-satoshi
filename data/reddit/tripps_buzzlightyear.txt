Your just making the sub ugly. There’s zero benefit to insulting people online, especially when you are trying to make a point.

Do you know the difference between ETH and ETC classic?
*please correct me if I am wrong, this is just my understanding * 
One of things that sets ETH apart from BTC is the use of smart contracts; code that is run by the Ethereum Virtual Machine. 
This can allow for Decentralised Autonomous Organisations; organisations that are governed by smart contracts; in order to be a 'member' of a DAO, you must pay with ether. This is a sort of 'crowd-sale' where people who think this DAO has potential, or is a good investment, can buy 'tokens' ( smart contracts that represent ownership/ membership of a DAO). 
The key thing is, a DAO is governed by **smart contracts**, and thus the security of a DAO is only as secure as the **smart contracts** of which it is made. 
So, what happens when a DAO has an ICO (where they sell 'tokens' in order to fund the DAO. Sort of like a kickstarter ), but **there is a security flaw in one of the smart contracts that governs the DAO?**
This happened with Slock.it; they had a ICO, went far beyond expectations ( raising 150 M$ if I recall correctly). Someone, who I consider a hero, discovered a flaw in the DAO's code, allowing them to siphon most of the DAO's ether (at the time I think it was worth 15% of all ether in circulation). 
THe ethereum foundation (the 'central authority') decided to hard-fork; **re write the history of the block chain**. Why? A lot of reasons; probably because ETH was an emergent technology that had a lot of interest by big corporations, and such a 'hack' would reduce its credibility and value as a cryptocurrency. 
But was it a 'hack'? As the name implies; Decentralised Autonomous Organisations are not run by people, they are run by the code that governs them. When you are dealing with hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions, would it not be prudent to ensure thorough testing that **the code which controls millions of dollars of ether** should be as air tight as possible? 
Why do employment contracts cover every possible scenario, from sick leave, to payment times, to the number of hours expected to be worked? **To insure against loopholes**. 
The man who found this loophole and used it for his benefit did what any smart, capable lawyer does on a day to day basis; find a weakness, and exploit it. His reward is his alone; it's not the fault of the Ethereum Foundation, nor the network, but the careless developers who simply **wrote bad code**. If you were selling your house today, and your lawyer drew up a contract which said 'btw if you find me a vintage shiny charizard card then you can buy the house for free', written in small print, then you can be damned sure that the law would protect that contract and I would have a new house right now. The seller can only blame the incompetence of their lawyer. *I didn't create the loophole* the lawyer did, and the fault rests solely on him. 
The Ethereum Foundation decided that, despite repeatedly asserting that the network is 'immutable' and 'censorship resistant', they decided a perfectly valid contract was invalid. They bailed out Slock.it, and in doing so, they became the central authority in charge of what is 'right' and what is 'wrong'. **Despite the fact that the Ethereum software worked as intended, the network worked as intended, and the code worked as intended**. 
By the way, did I mention several Ethereum Foundation Members were advisors to the DAO (Slock.it)? 
So they forked the blockchain; What was once the original fork is now called ETC. The rewritten blockchain, where the central authority, benevolent guardian Ethereum Foundation, is called ETH. 
please correct me on any details, I'm writing from memory and with a very bad headache.

yeah they are really backlogged, i made a bitcoin deposit, 20+ confirmations but status still pending
