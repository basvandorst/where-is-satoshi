ask him to send you some first, then you give him only some BTC. in any case, have him go first, or transact in really small amount at a time
@_date: 2017-01-15 18:24:52
Uhh no? You get refunded the amount you paid, no?
@_date: 2017-01-06 18:59:26
Timer? Huh? I've bought several things using Purse.io but I don't recall seeing a timer
@_date: 2017-01-02 22:02:44
double post?
@_date: 2017-01-01 19:16:35
all we need now is a hack to occur :3
@_date: 2017-01-01 01:20:31
yup, I agree with that BTC can be divided almost indefinitely, but my OP is about BTC in the super long term, where accidents can and will occur. But yeah, technically we won't run out of BTC as long there's at least one individual or entity who has some amount of BTC.
@_date: 2017-01-03 02:50:38
because power companies tend to be pretty heavily regulated, no? If they can choose to do whatever they want with the electricity, what's stopping them from creating a monopoly and charging an absurd amount in an area? the gov steps in and tries to lower the cost of electricity and makes sure (ideally) everyone has access to it. 
@_date: 2017-01-07 23:54:49
we are already losing coins, that's inevitable. But since it's digital, we can always increase the decimal places if needed. 
But as time -&gt; infinity, the total amount of BTC -&gt; 0
@_date: 2017-01-01 19:24:19
yeah, but the general trend should be an upward one, just like stocks, no?
@_date: 2017-01-02 16:39:15
Oh, that because I monitor the price like the moment I'm on my computer, and I've set price alerts and such, so I figured in the event it does start dropping, I would still secure some gains from the increase in price
@_date: 2017-01-02 01:31:29
various, used Blockchain.info, coinbase, polo, and electrum
@_date: 2017-01-01 23:56:00
yup, presumably. Is that good enough?
@_date: 2017-01-01 23:12:24
You can buy BTC from Coinbase, or any online exchange site, and just transfer it to an offline personal wallet. This way, you have the keys and control your own money. After that, you can do whatever you want with your BTC :)
@_date: 2017-01-02 19:39:05
Nope, fiat is still needed
@_date: 2017-01-01 19:02:20
^yup, that's the price they are selling at
@_date: 2017-01-01 00:41:58
as t -&gt; infinity, the amount of BTC -&gt; 0, where t is time  
Is that good enough? O.o
@_date: 2017-01-01 22:30:00
not enough info, use an online calculator. decide based on the calculations

stolfi? what does that mean? I've only recently learnt of hodl, since it was used quite frequently for the past weeks
@_date: 2017-01-01 23:22:10

yup, that's neat!

In case you haven't already, there are several threads discussing on this topic. Please use the search bar on the top right corner.
@_date: 2017-01-02 01:22:58
Not the first one to think of something like this. It depends on your costs of the heater, thermal output, and such. So, you would have to calculate it and decide from there.
@_date: 2017-01-04 18:44:28
Huh? ATH was like $1240 back in 2013/2014
@_date: 2017-01-07 23:53:24
yup, that's what happened to me. I linked my Bank of America account and have made two transactions to it by selling
@_date: 2017-01-03 16:52:24
Many people have used it, so it seems fine. Though that can also be said for Coinbase, but you're too scared to use that either. Can't really help you if you think everything is a scam lol
@_date: 2017-01-01 20:33:11
there's always going to be some differences between the exchange rate, depending on the exchange itself
@_date: 2017-01-02 02:19:14
no clue, you think we are fortune tellers or something? 
@_date: 2017-01-03 05:39:50
who would be bad for what? O.o
@_date: 2017-01-07 03:48:27
a single, universal fiat?
@_date: 2017-01-02 01:25:03
oh, is that how it would work? I didn't know about the fees not being accepted part.

If you are able to send it to somewhere else, it's as good as yours
@_date: 2017-01-07 23:57:11
I said the total amount of BTC
@_date: 2017-01-15 18:47:41
oh wait, one is able to return wishlist items that others have bought? O.o
@_date: 2017-01-07 23:55:56
buy a cheapo asic usb miner. Learn how to setup up the software, make a wallet, etc. but to actually get any fraction of a bitcoin, you're going to need a beefier ASIS, like those from Antminer
@_date: 2017-01-10 19:00:27
Coinbase? Bitpay?
@_date: 2017-01-01 22:35:12
lol thanks
@_date: 2017-01-03 05:43:18
I guess it would be bad for people what wants to convert USD to BTC, since those people would be getting less BTC than previously
@_date: 2017-01-01 21:44:59
not for people who are shorting BTC
@_date: 2017-01-03 02:33:08
@_date: 2017-01-03 02:09:01
but there's been reports of miners stealing electricity from the plants. What about those that aren't reported?  
Dunno worth to attempt to ban or nah for China

why did he/you guys put in your life savings into something you guys aren't even familiar with and especially listening to random strangers online...?   
I think at this point just hold, unless you guys really really need the money. But then again, here you are asking random strangers about your finances

there are several articles on the high inflation rates of currencies in some countries. China has pretty tight money control; they have an exchange limit of RMB -&gt; USD per month/year and only Chinese citizens are allowed to make such conversions.

failing economies in several countries, new economic policies, inflation, restrictions on the movement of money; people seek to BTC to alleviate/lessen some of the issues.

ahh, lowered transaction fees, ehh still going generate some sort of income from it, so whatever lol 
@_date: 2017-01-06 07:11:56
whoa, I have only seen the gif of it going up and down the ramps, there are other btc gifs of it on other parts of the track?!
@_date: 2017-01-07 04:52:49
Any PC can be used for an Antminer, the PC is just used to configure and point the miner to which pool to mine. The Antminer doesn't need to be connected to a computer. So, literally, any Antminer will work.  
but you should do a bit research on profitability using an online calculator
@_date: 2017-01-03 00:25:05
OS? Driver version? mining software? we need a bit more info unless you want us to guess your setup
@_date: 2017-01-03 00:29:32
@_date: 2017-01-01 21:07:55
yeah, I waiting for Coinbase to get to $1000 mark, since they have like a $5 margin between asking price and the actual value of BTC. I really like Coinbase's chart for their app; it's clean. I took a screenshot and posted it on my Instagram haha
@_date: 2017-01-01 18:04:24
send the BTC somewhere else?
@_date: 2017-01-03 17:03:24
Have you looked at Coinbase and localbitcoins yet?
@_date: 2017-01-12 00:56:44
@_date: 2017-01-01 20:14:07
do you not see all the other $1000 posts on here? lol
@_date: 2017-01-07 01:13:06
Nice research
@_date: 2017-01-05 18:31:03
Value = purchasing power
@_date: 2017-01-03 05:24:33
BTC is essentially money, so if you don't have to means to get it now, get it later when all the other stuff is sorted out. Really don't know what else to tell you man
@_date: 2017-01-01 21:16:18
what if Google gets hacked? *cue the dramatic music*  
Or what if it's actually Google secretly stealing everyone's BTC? *cue the dramatic music again*  
Just practice safe Internet security and you should be fine. Google Auth should be fine, as long you're not exposing yourself in other ways.
@_date: 2017-01-01 23:18:32
no clue, I haven't looked into Dogecoin for years, that's on you to do research
@_date: 2017-01-01 00:51:15
yup, so as time goes on, BTC will approach 0.  
It may be actually 0 if all the holders just decide to discard their wallets, but the point of my "mathematical thinking" is that the supply of BTC will always be decreasing given our current parameters.
@_date: 2017-01-01 21:45:17
@_date: 2017-01-01 18:13:26

@_date: 2017-01-02 02:29:28
there's money to be made in the cryptocurrency space. I don't see BTC or any coin replacing fiat, there's a need for some oversight
@_date: 2017-01-01 21:13:49
ok then, if you've done the research, then go for it. The interest rates in bank accounts are pretty low, so if you can make more money with BTC or altcoins, sure.
@_date: 2017-01-01 19:34:27
nobody knows, spooky isn't it?
@_date: 2017-01-07 08:31:18
Probably, but even so, the Chinese gov can't really do anything about it

flip a coin
@_date: 2017-01-02 01:52:57
yup, that's how most investments work lol, but interesting stats on the 6days/7years thing
@_date: 2017-01-01 20:55:37
@_date: 2017-01-15 09:59:16
If you have 51% of the network hashing rate, possibly yes. Other than that, nope.
@_date: 2017-01-01 19:09:23
like calculating if mining is profitable or not? There's so many calculators online
@_date: 2017-01-02 20:18:55
uhh I think transaction fees might be more than that, so you can't really send something that small. You can buy fractions of bitcoins online, coinbase, blockchain.info (I think), localbitcoins, etc
@_date: 2017-01-05 08:18:52
and the increase in general literacy of computers, that's going to take a while lol
@_date: 2017-01-01 22:28:11
If I flip a coin, will it land on head or tail?  
No one knows. If you think it's going to keep going up, buy. If you think it's going to take a dip, wait. etc
@_date: 2017-01-01 06:02:42
oh true, though if there are space travel and such, money would still exist
@_date: 2017-01-05 07:28:06
not sure, but does Purse.io work?
@_date: 2017-01-02 09:15:41
I mine, so I'm not like you guys who put in money directly for BTC. I put my money in hardware (GPUs, ASIC, and the necessary supplies, like PSUs), so I can always resell. 
@_date: 2017-01-01 19:21:06
though wouldn't BTC go up over time anyway due to currency inflation?
@_date: 2017-01-01 20:50:00
What's your risk tolerance? What's your sentiment on cryptocurrency? Are you ok with potentially losing everything you've invested into BTC?  
Use whatever exchange works for you. Coinbase is alright, but the general thing is just that you shouldn't store any coins online, unless you are a trader or going to convert them relatively soon.
@_date: 2017-01-03 04:33:46
Yup, that's why BRK.A looks better than BTC 
@_date: 2017-01-06 10:16:16
But who is Satoshi Nakamoto? Hmmm ��
@_date: 2017-01-03 05:03:47
True. Yeah, even though I do spend BTC, I'm pretty sure I'm going to stay in the cryptocurrency space and have at least some asset in some coin
@_date: 2017-01-01 23:23:13

and what? O.o
@_date: 2017-01-03 06:38:54
@_date: 2017-01-02 10:12:31
uhhh I think the fees of the exchange would be higher than the amount of BTC you would gain if you wanted pennies worth of BTC.  
Coinbase, locatbitcoins, bitcoin atm, etc?
@_date: 2017-01-01 21:35:21
Google just pulls that data from another site, so it's more like Google repeating the exchange rate according to their source
@_date: 2017-01-15 18:41:12
but the items were bought through other people. How can he return items that other people has bought? All the order info are on those people's accounts
@_date: 2017-01-03 02:05:22
but a lot of that money isn't in the hands of the gov, no? So, yes, China as a whole is making a lot of money from BTC, but not necessarily the gov itself.

"Man, I shouldn't have used Mt. Gox"
@_date: 2017-01-03 05:17:07
instead of getting a paycheck in USD, ask if you can get paid BTC? Exchange giftcard codes for BTC? BTC is treated as a currency, so if you don't have the money to get it, you would have to work for it essentially.
@_date: 2017-01-02 19:38:45
coinbase, localbitcoins, blockchain.info (I think), etc
@_date: 2017-01-03 05:14:24
Ahh I haven't really thought about it from the Chinese citizens living there perspective, more like people who wants to move the asset they have in China outside the country.  
They can convert BTC to USD. I live in the US and my mom has RMB in China, but is unable to easily move that outside China. So, Bitcoin crushing the USD would be good for us
@_date: 2017-01-03 05:50:16
ahh I watched a video explaining and it said that lower transactions fee might occur, which is going to upset the mining community, but yeah, def going to look into this a bit more when I have more time
@_date: 2017-01-01 23:14:44
It's going to look like Apple's stock ticker of 2015-2016
@_date: 2017-01-02 01:21:15
I would think yes, but people who are doing this are going to end up paying a lot in fees :/
@_date: 2017-01-13 10:09:58
If there's money to be made and you're willing to put in some effort, sure, why not?
@_date: 2017-01-02 00:03:54
those are too, but this post isn't really helping either other than contributing to it :/
@_date: 2017-01-01 05:16:18
eww, that's nasty
@_date: 2017-01-02 06:47:13
Online calculators. This also depends on the efficiency of the miner itself.
@_date: 2017-01-01 20:39:56
@_date: 2017-01-03 05:51:27
what would be better for every one else? currencies being devalued while BTC is gaining value in comparison?  O.o
@_date: 2017-01-02 02:29:39
@_date: 2017-01-03 02:55:28
well, at least BRK.A has a good upward trend and no major dips, unlike BTC if we're going to compare the overall charts...
@_date: 2017-01-01 21:47:11
I also want fiat to win, but I hold some BTC as well. Does that make me an asshole? O.o
@_date: 2017-01-08 02:05:52
hope you saved up a lot of money for that, glhf 
@_date: 2017-01-07 19:16:18
that seems natural given how more supply of BTC is added into the system over time and how BTC becomes more well known
@_date: 2017-01-01 16:49:13
Hindsight bias much?
@_date: 2017-01-03 07:33:58
ayeee lmao
@_date: 2017-01-03 03:58:36
I would imagine yes in countries where the gov have total control of the network. There are several countries that have tight censorship laws, like China. So, if their network can identify and block traffic related to BTC, then yes.
@_date: 2017-01-08 07:57:51
wow, I really like the explanation with that analogy! And also, I didn't know Medium existed back then, I have only heard of Medium recently haha
@_date: 2017-01-02 22:03:14
because some miners don't actually believe in BTC and mine because there's money to be made
@_date: 2017-01-03 00:47:22
Windows...7? 8? 10? 8.1?
@_date: 2017-01-08 08:52:17
It's freedom in that you control your own money. Those services, like Coinbase, has to get verification to operate within US and follow US laws and such.
@_date: 2016-12-27 04:53:46
this is what I usually reply to these types of posts haha  
Unless the poster has shown that they had done some research on their own and is just asking for some insights/second opinions from others, then yeah, that's a much better post than a very generic, blanket question of "Should I do X"
@_date: 2017-01-02 09:48:47
oh, that calculation is based on if the 24 words are already known. If it's unknown, and varies in length, then the possibilities are even higher aka even more impossible to crack
@_date: 2017-01-08 07:59:27
Yup, just like in the stock market, the majority of the trades are executed by bots

I thought Blockchain.info is, no?
@_date: 2017-01-01 19:19:44
maybe, maybe not. Maybe something big happens and will cause the price to go down.
@_date: 2017-01-01 23:51:16
In China, there's a lot of volume of BTC, presumably to get money out of the country. 
@_date: 2017-01-01 02:32:44
@_date: 2016-12-26 03:38:26
its like $50,000 USD worth per year per person or something like that. And there's a monthly cap as well, I think. And you have to be Chinese citizen or something. 
@_date: 2016-12-31 09:08:13
I guess that's pretty neat
@_date: 2016-12-29 18:56:23
But what if they're right? O.o
@_date: 2016-12-28 05:33:48
well, my point is that BTC is and probably will be quite centralized
@_date: 2016-12-25 00:38:34
depends. what's your budget and your electricity cost? will heat output be a factor for you?
@_date: 2016-12-29 01:27:08
lol nice response
@_date: 2016-12-24 06:52:20
this is pretty old video .-. but I guess it's still pretty informative, though I don't think Moore's law play into a factor into this... *shrug*
@_date: 2017-01-05 18:32:43
Prices changes all the time
@_date: 2017-01-03 02:38:21
well, the charts she has isn't wrong, BTC did plummet and it took 1+ years to recover
@_date: 2016-12-25 01:12:27
uhh outdated article, especially considering how volatile BTC is right now...
@_date: 2017-01-30 10:57:50
IIRC, a top gov official on like the board for currency/finances is like pro-BTC 
@_date: 2017-01-03 05:02:16
Well, the capital used to buy BTC may only stay in China for a while, since the movement of BTC is not regulated and can move capital outside the country. So, if China does come up with a way to block the traffic of BTC through their networks somehow, then I don't see why China wouldn't attempt to regulate BTC while their RMB is being devalued like crazy right now
@_date: 2017-01-01 20:42:44
yes, indeed
@_date: 2016-12-25 08:08:53
did you consider shorting?
@_date: 2016-12-25 08:07:28
yes, people are using BTC to address real needs, but not significant enough
@_date: 2017-01-02 19:48:42
welp, I'm still using fiat, along with essentially everyone else, so...¯\_(ツ)_/¯

online exchanges/wallet security has (theoretically) gotten a lot better, so the likelihood of a single hack essentially causing BTC to go from $1000+ to ~$200 is very unlikely.
@_date: 2016-12-26 05:17:40
yup, the surge caused a lot of media attention on BTC
@_date: 2016-12-29 09:03:48
oh wow, I never thought about it that way. I didn't really think too much about it, but what you said makes sense. Yeah, I'll try to be more aware of this sort of thing next time. Thanks for the insightful comment!  
Edit: yeah, I don't force it down their throat, I always first ask them if they had heard about it, and if they did but not know much about it, then I would go on a long explanation and such. But yeah, I think I'll change that up a bit haha
@_date: 2016-12-25 11:17:10
Ask us whether to buy in or not after you do some research on BTC
@_date: 2016-12-29 02:50:04
well, if you suspect your computer and wifi network being compromised, then don't do anything on your devices that have sensitive information 
@_date: 2016-12-26 23:26:01
Ahh ok, interesting info, thanks for sharing!
@_date: 2016-12-26 00:24:20
what's on December 10th, 2019?
@_date: 2016-12-26 18:49:57
I'm not sure about the Mycelium app, but the reason why something is less safe isn't because of the number of ways to access/login to it, it's where the BTC is located. If using an online wallet, like Blockchain.info, the BTC and keys and everything is stored on their end, you literally have no access to the keys. So, in the event of a hack or some system failure, the BTC held in their storage might get lost. The idea why personal, offline wallets are highly recommended is because YOU get to control your own money. You have the keys.  
I wouldn't say phones are more secure than computers...phones are essentially computers as well
@_date: 2016-12-25 20:26:36
there's no way to know until such a recession has occurred. There some who say BTC is a safe haven, and others who say it's not.
@_date: 2016-12-28 04:48:01
really bad, since Chinese miners will probably have the majority of the hashing power and ownership of available BTC. I would imagine that's not good for any type of currency :/
@_date: 2016-12-31 01:40:44
US has already deemed BTC to be classified as property.  
But if BTC does become deemed illegal worldwide and gov has the capability to see who owns BTC, then I would imagine that the price/value would plummet, at least temporarily, since no one would want to risk being caught and BTC would go underground and rise in value  from there
@_date: 2017-01-03 16:43:31
Local bitcoins, maybe even purse.io?
@_date: 2016-12-25 05:31:30
If the number of transactions and the volume doesn't convince retailers to start accepting BTC, I don't think a letter/email will. This requires a large group of people forming a union or something.
@_date: 2016-12-24 23:25:24
spam much?
@_date: 2016-12-26 05:06:24


huh? 
@_date: 2017-01-03 02:03:09
there was literally just a thread on this Bitcoin ATM topic three hours ago. look it up using the search bar
@_date: 2016-12-26 05:05:37
if you're bullish and think it will rise in the short or long term and you're willing to hold it until it does, sure. If not, then no
@_date: 2016-12-31 00:08:27
It's already 31st in some countries, so....Nope, probably not
@_date: 2016-12-28 22:51:55
or if the value of BTC itself increases, then yeah, mining may be worth it. Depends on your sentiment toward BTC and how the market is moving.
@_date: 2016-12-25 00:12:16
^omg lol so this! hahaha
@_date: 2016-12-31 01:28:26
oh oops, misunderstood your post, my bad
@_date: 2017-01-10 20:45:34
@_date: 2016-12-25 18:46:07
hmm maybe but those are low level employees that does the cashier stuff, but yeah, over a long period of time and with enough people, that might give low level employees the idea and for them to ask their managers about it
@_date: 2016-12-29 21:31:39
No, getting data wouldn't affect what you've purchased, just like how our credit card company/gov knows what we buy, that's doesn't really affect our purchases, unless ofc it's illegal or whatnot.
@_date: 2016-12-26 07:34:25
"Nearly every major government and central banks in the world try to do everything they can to stop it, yet they can't"
uhhh yeah, no. This is pretty much false. The US made some proposal/guideline to regulate it for taxing purposes, but that doesn't mean that the US is trying to "stop" BTC. In fact, by recognising it at a taxable good, I think it would mean that US Gov is trying to accept BTC. There are so many countries that are "pro/neutral" about BTC.  
Yeah, I stopped the video at this point, such glorification of BTC, just no
@_date: 2016-12-26 01:01:20
there's a coinbase app btw. you would need to get a separate wallet and transfer the btc from coinbase to there.
@_date: 2017-01-01 21:37:53
@_date: 2016-12-31 23:52:03
screenshot proof please?
@_date: 2017-01-01 19:08:28
If you plan on going back into BTC, I think you should still continue to keep on the news and trends in the cryptocurrency space. Intentionally not keeping up with BTC after an extended amount of time really puts you quite behind when you do want to jump in again.
@_date: 2016-12-28 10:16:05
Have sold BTC on Coinbase it came within a week or so, I think, but it came, so I'm going to continue using Coinbase
@_date: 2016-12-31 00:09:06
Dunno 
@_date: 2016-12-26 02:36:29
"Nearly every major government and central banks in the world try to do everything they can to stop it, yet they can't"

@_date: 2016-12-26 05:19:13
uhh because better security...what exactly are you asking?
@_date: 2016-12-30 07:37:46
I don't know of one, but I'm sure there's some sort of a timed online message vault thing that you can set the time and input the seed? 
@_date: 2016-12-28 22:31:22
1. check forums for their list of pools  
2. Miners get paid based on the block reward and transaction fees. Not sure what exactly you are asking, but yes, if you're mining in a pool, your source of BTC would be from the transaction fees and such  
3. If you have free electricity, sure, why not? 
@_date: 2016-12-24 21:02:35
a bank adopting/making their own cryptocurrency
@_date: 2016-12-28 05:51:54
dang, nice!
@_date: 2016-12-24 07:13:11
whoa I didn't know there were Bitcoin debit cards until I saw your post and I knew about Bitcoin back in late 2013/early 2014 and just got back into cryptocurrency this summer
@_date: 2017-01-07 03:36:56
wow about..?
@_date: 2017-01-01 00:11:47
but doesn't really solve the issue where BTC can be lost. The supply will always go down, eventually so minuscule that it's effectively 0.0, if not 0 BTC itself
@_date: 2017-01-03 07:35:14
yes, it will go down at some point, or did you expect the trend of BTC to y = x?
@_date: 2016-12-30 04:47:14
we are getting enough of these posts... -_-
@_date: 2016-12-29 02:35:42
^I second this about not much higher than $1000, def not $2000. Timeframe wise, maybe within January, then dip/platau
@_date: 2016-12-26 01:47:55
uhh ok, sure?
@_date: 2016-12-26 05:30:19
that's why I said "theoretically" in my previous post. Because of the catastrophic effect of Mt. Gox hack, present and future online exchanges/wallets should be more aware and take precaution against such losses. I know that some wallets/exchanges have their funds insured and stuff.
@_date: 2016-12-29 18:55:51
I thought that's it general knowledge that just leaving it in the bank generally won't earn too much, it's more like a safe storage place than an investment fund to earn more...
@_date: 2016-12-26 21:51:00
What research have you done so far on your own?
@_date: 2016-12-25 00:46:41
ehh still not adopted by mainstream after 4+ years. I was literally the only one who knew about BTC in my college dorm hall
@_date: 2016-12-28 11:10:31
@_date: 2017-01-07 08:33:15
Uhh as a future reference, putting $500+ into something you're new in is probably not a good idea, unless of course you have a lot of disposable income. But yeah, like the other guy said, check the transaction ID
@_date: 2016-12-25 01:11:07
I was referring to the impacts by BTC and of the Blockchain tech that is supposed to be revolutionary/groundbreaking. Maybe those stuff are still in the works *shrug*
@_date: 2016-12-29 03:01:41
at school, I like to talk about tech, so yeah, sometimes there will be conversations about cryptocurrency. I also bring up about BTC to new people I meet, so often that my friends sometimes tease me by quoting the stuff I say to said new people
@_date: 2016-12-31 08:13:21
Use an online calculator
@_date: 2016-12-31 01:51:22
in future posts, can you actually put the content of the post in the title, so readers would have an idea what the post would be about, instead of the title being quite ambiguous?  
Thanks :3
@_date: 2016-12-28 04:01:24
@_date: 2016-12-26 01:42:50
how long ago was the btc sent?
@_date: 2016-12-28 20:20:13
borrow a friend's laptop/webcam?
@_date: 2017-01-01 22:26:19
mods, sticky this?  
also, nice background pic choice, I actually ordered a metal print of it :3
@_date: 2016-12-24 20:00:56
can't we already just get a fraction of a BTC, no?
@_date: 2016-12-24 06:41:14
so they want the bubble to burst so they lost out on their earnings now to hope that it will go back up to recoup their gains? huh?
@_date: 2016-12-25 21:47:49
well, if no email address, it won't hurt to try those two other platforms haha
@_date: 2016-12-26 20:50:24
ahh ok, didn't know about that, but hopefully the idea of who is storing the BTC can still be understood haha
@_date: 2016-12-25 00:33:15
been waiting for 4+ years and nothing significant has came out yet :3
@_date: 2016-12-31 23:54:45
So, an economic system based solely on BTC doesn't seem feasible? Since, eventually, almost all BTC will be lost in the super long term?
@_date: 2016-12-25 20:28:32
neither do people who are shorting
@_date: 2016-12-25 04:37:15
hmm maybe, lol it's kind of sad to wait for something huge to happen in the economy/finance industry to see how it effects BTC lol  
But yeah, you're true on the part about BTC being much more mature. I got into BTC in late 2013/early 2014 and left the community after a few months. Just got back into the mining community this summer
@_date: 2016-12-29 02:36:29
Many will die and perish, there will be years of disorder, but all in the hope of a better future
@_date: 2016-12-29 10:35:21
Why not just use a different hard drive as the OS drive and run your computer from there if you're so paranoid?
@_date: 2016-12-25 00:04:37
or it means that the banks are already monitoring BTC and decided it's nothing too significant so they aren't taking any actions concerning BTC
@_date: 2016-12-25 20:31:13
then what does matter about "883"? O.o
@_date: 2016-12-24 22:43:36
well, its been out for 4+ years now, and despite several reports of increased usage in countries where their economy/currency is somewhat failing, BTC still seems to be insignificant. I'm not counting on BTC being too significant any time soon
@_date: 2016-12-25 05:28:23
What does the length of time knowing BTC have to do with memorizing and/or keeping track of a passphrase?
@_date: 2016-12-29 21:38:28
The IRS has already seems BTC to be considered as a property, therefore it's taxable, back in like 2014
@_date: 2016-12-26 05:09:22
rmb vs btc, no?
@_date: 2016-12-28 22:32:05
thousand in which currency though? ;)
@_date: 2017-01-03 00:50:00
yeah, because I read windows 10 generally doesn't play too nice to Nvidia cards and/or mining software  
Edit: that also goes for Nvidia drivers, I have also read that some Nvidia drivers actually may decrease the hash rate
@_date: 2016-12-26 23:25:45
OP never specified an exchange and/or wallet
@_date: 2016-12-29 00:38:26
ETH, I hope to get out of BTC before a major price correction occurs, assuming it does
@_date: 2016-12-25 00:13:05
so does that mean the someone has a bearish sentiment toward BTC?
@_date: 2016-12-28 04:00:12
Where do you live? I visited a Bticoin ATM in Tustin/Irvine, California and there was no verification
@_date: 2016-12-29 02:41:24
I thought the FBI or something managed to trace IP addresses and traffic and such on Tor, essentially making Tor not very secure, no?
@_date: 2016-12-28 20:23:37
21 BTC * USD/BTC exchange rate? That's how much wealth needed to be in the "million richest people"

@_date: 2016-12-26 19:39:13
yes, going back to the previous high after the dip yesterday
@_date: 2016-12-29 21:36:25
But is BTC even alive to begin with?
@_date: 2016-12-25 01:33:36
have you tried coinbase?
@_date: 2016-12-28 22:34:59
oh, I'm prob going to sell when it breaks $1000 mark. I feel most people in BTC are in it for the potential to earn money, not actually for the tech behind it. Like, I mean, I'm interested in the tech, but I rather have $1000 than a BTC that's valued much less than that, assuming there's a price correction
@_date: 2016-12-26 05:07:49
not too sure, but is it possible to withdraw those funds to a bank account? From there, you can buy BTC from sites like coinbase (if you're in the US)
@_date: 2016-12-29 18:38:23
If IRS wins, then they get all the data and get their demands fulfilled. People might leave Coinbase, people might not.
@_date: 2016-12-29 03:39:13
Nothing, because I plan on selling before a presumed price correction occurs. No clue when I'm getting back into BTC, but I am continuously mining altcoins so I can always convert coins into BTC. I've only bought BTC when checking out a BTC ATM, $16-$20 worth at the time
@_date: 2017-01-07 03:37:18
why guilty?
@_date: 2016-12-25 00:19:15
OP's is about BTC mainstream adoption. Even with BTC worth hundreds or even the record high of $1200, that doesn't mean it's getting adopted by the average Joe. This lack of adoption is even further indicated by the relative lack of much actions by banks given BTC's 4+ years of existence
@_date: 2016-12-31 23:51:33
nah, we are all waiting for 2018
@_date: 2016-12-31 01:47:58
really? you consider the current state of BTC to being underground? hmm I thought all the positive effects and things that are being developed on due to BTC would make it go "above ground"
@_date: 2016-12-28 05:37:21
watched the first 5 min. scrubbed through the rest, and saw that this isn't really a documentary about BTC, or at least not to the part that I scrubbed to. Timestamps for the part to BTC please?
@_date: 2016-12-31 23:12:21
probably not, given the performance the past few days
@_date: 2016-12-29 01:02:13
what's after the moon though? O.o
@_date: 2016-12-26 06:43:30
yup, sure, np
@_date: 2016-12-26 05:02:50
wait, wtf did he really say that? or are you trolling? O.o
@_date: 2016-12-29 21:34:15
Bill payment for what services? Or in general?
@_date: 2016-12-25 01:45:52
wait it does? hmm I made an account a while ago, so I thought a bank account was enough. Uhh what about Bitfenix? I think that site has a way to transfer USD-&gt;BTC, I think. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 09:47:32
Not a good article whatsoever
@_date: 2016-12-31 01:02:36
It gets its randomness from the random mouse movement, so the more random the mouse movement, the more random the key
@_date: 2016-12-31 20:53:03
nice, that's a good reasoning
@_date: 2016-12-28 20:38:23
it's literally just dividing two numbers though...lol
@_date: 2016-12-25 20:29:33
  
uhh Poloniex? Bitfinex
@_date: 2016-12-25 21:38:41
have you reached out to them on FB and/or TWTR?
@_date: 2016-12-24 20:18:11
sure, if you want to lock in your profits right now
@_date: 2016-12-28 07:52:34
purse.io fees? or having the sellers take the hit to convert their Amazon balances to BTCs
@_date: 2016-12-28 20:22:06
that would depend on how much BTC is being sent, no?
@_date: 2016-12-29 00:16:16
^sort of, essentially buy BTC in other regions that's cheaper, sell BTC on Chinese exchange, right?
@_date: 2016-12-28 04:14:18
I don't get it. I've used Purse.io to buy some stuff. How are people using stolen CC's on Purse.io?
@_date: 2016-12-26 18:53:25
Well, for Bitcoin capital to go down, that would mean either the value per BTC is less or someone intentionally destroys their BTC. For bank's capital to go down, that could mean that everyone withdrew, no? I think a comparison would make sense if it's between a bank and a bank, not a bank and a currency. What if I compared Bank X with the USD? Of course the USD is going to have more remaining capital.
@_date: 2016-12-26 02:18:09
I don't think BTC/USD rates are that extreme, but yeah, there are some disparity between exchanges
@_date: 2016-12-28 06:38:33
yup, if any country holds the majority of the mining capabilities and BTC itself, then yeah, that's quite centralized. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 01:35:12
hmm I would imagine there would be fewer miners because there wouldn't be block rewards anymore, only transaction fees, so fewer incentives for miners to continue mining?   
"----"  
Though if BTC does indeed get adopted by the masses, then there's the argument of there being more volume of transactions, so there would be a need for a lot of miners.  
"------------------------------------"  
EDIT: oops, my bad, forgot about that BTC will still have block rewards until like 2140, I assume super long term, after the block rewards are gone
@_date: 2016-12-26 10:48:30
Oh oops, my bad on the wording, I was referring to the likelihood of a hack, or rather a successful hack 
@_date: 2016-12-26 01:13:17
oh lol is this a troll or a typo?
@_date: 2016-12-29 01:01:22
So, assuming mining is still a huge thing in 2025, regions with the highest % of sunny days would benefit. Ehh, but one would still need to calculate the ROI on the Solar panels themselves
@_date: 2016-12-31 19:47:47
anything backing up your statement of BTC going to blow soon?
@_date: 2016-12-26 06:13:31
^prob this?  
I don't follow news of India that much, just snippits here and there. But if I were to guess, it's probably similar to here in the US where online exchanges has to get certain info to make transactions and has to follow US regulations and such
@_date: 2016-12-29 02:33:17
generally, yes. There's a lot of info online why storing BTC/ETC online isn't great, especially long term. What if the company goes under? What if the company gets hacked? What if the company just one day packs up and leave without any notice? So, generally, it's recommended to store your coins offline
@_date: 2016-12-29 00:35:42
well,  in the beginning, ASIC machines kept improving at quite a rapid pace, so to be ahead and efficient, that would mean one would have to constantly upgrade. It's also not really worthwhile for quite some time due to difficulty, I guess. And BTC ATMs aren't really a thing, it's still not really a thing :/ 
@_date: 2016-12-26 02:39:45
errr, did you consider using something like coinbase?
@_date: 2016-12-29 04:11:59
nah, just don't want to get screwed up by a price correction or anything
@_date: 2016-12-28 04:42:59
we'll see if what he said is true or not. But high value of BTC doesn't mean it's not a failure.
@_date: 2016-12-29 02:13:39
oops, my bad, forgot about that BTC will still have block rewards until like 2140 
@_date: 2016-12-24 03:15:37
+1 for Coinbase and/or Poloniex
@_date: 2016-12-28 08:16:59
indeed, but at least I am willing to show that by asking questions
@_date: 2016-12-29 02:44:44
ahhh, yup, transaction fee rises over time, didn't know about that until I had just looked it up
@_date: 2017-01-06 07:10:15
yup, I like this one, props to whoever made this haha
@_date: 2017-01-02 20:07:57
free money? not really, at least not in any significant amount
@_date: 2016-12-28 11:10:01
A lot of transactions doesn't necessarily mean the user base is growing, or at least significantly. These transactions could be by the same people (market manipulation?). Just something to take note, but yeah, it's better than than it going down and being flat 
@_date: 2016-12-24 01:29:41
How much did you invest?
@_date: 2016-12-28 04:43:36
ok, we'll see :3
@_date: 2016-12-25 01:09:09
hmm I think it's slightly different since most people now have access to the Internet and computers, at least in developed countries. This would make it seem that people would at least gain knowledge of the existence and the basic idea of BTC, but even that's not the case.  
For the Internet to go mainstream, people would need to have or have access to a computer. This barrier of entry to the Internet is a lot higher than the barrier of entry of just searching up the term "Bitcoin" on a search engine.  
Dunno, I'm not too well knowledgeful in of adoption rate and such.
@_date: 2016-12-29 00:45:53
well, relative to current fiat ATM's. There's very few BTC ATMs in the areas I've lived here in southern California, or at least that I know of
@_date: 2016-12-28 04:46:31
wait, are you for the bet that BTC will reach $1000 or against it? O.o
@_date: 2016-12-26 05:31:35
ahh I see and user/bearCatBird edited his post haha nice touch
@_date: 2016-12-26 06:18:58
man, this is like the 4th post I've seen today...
@_date: 2016-12-25 00:24:02
uhhh sure, ok. I own some asset in BTC and I also think BTC so far is quite insignificant. I haven't heard of anything major that have come out of BTC or of the Blockchain tech that behind it... :/
@_date: 2016-12-26 06:17:20
wow, I mean, hard code wise, I don't understand, but I do have some understanding of the other stuff you've listed.  
I highly recommend this video:   
I also highly recommend this article:

Prob stuff like volume of exchanges from those countries?
@_date: 2016-12-26 01:20:42
there are several wallet, pick and choose one that fits your needs. Yup, you would transfer your coinbase BTC to the wallet's address

freedom of speech and the spread of misinformation. That's why we need better journalism, not articles with click-bait titles haha

So is there a tool to continuously calculate the ATH of BTC?
@_date: 2016-12-25 20:27:58
who's "them"? C'mon be specific. I hate seeing posts where the title is quite non-descriptive and the OP wants us to play a guessing game.
@_date: 2016-12-25 01:11:00
ok yup, totally agree with you on this, I was just mentioning about OP's post of BTC mainstream adoption, which isn't there.

my sister works in the finance industry at Bank of America and she says that they don't talk about bitcoin much because it's not significant enough
@_date: 2016-12-26 05:04:20
well, it did earlier today at like ~$840 or so, but yup, let's see if it's going to keep going or slow back down to a stop again

transactions fees are what pays and incentivizes miners to keep mining to keep the network going. So, I guess yeah, the fees goes to the pool and paid out the pool's miners.

ahh my bad, I wasn't aware of the other agency's stance on BTC. Though that's pretty trippy, BTC can essentially be defined as multiple  ifferent things depending on the situation in a court.

oh...I have a bet that's against it, so, whales, don't appear! Do it after 2016!
@_date: 2016-12-24 20:46:55
make a new account in the meantime?
@_date: 2016-12-25 19:16:03
well, that's an exchange. To have a trading network is to have a large asset of BTC in one location, or at least processed by one entity. There are several exchanges out there.
@_date: 2016-12-28 20:07:17
Same here, it does indeed feel like the reason for such media buzz around BTC is due to its price
