Why I've had nothing wrong with blochain for 6 years. Parrots just reaPeat idiocy
@_date: 2019-10-12 05:53:11
Did they change UI too?

Whoa, I've never even heard of a btc atm. very surprised that there even is one in my shitty little town. Much thanks!!

Are there any banks now that don't block debit transactions through coinbase? Getting really tired of 2 week wait times...

Coinbase pro? Hmm, I don't think that's what I have. I just use the Android app. 
But yeah, when I try to buy with my bank account it says funds will be available instantly, but can't be traded for 14 days. Maybe I'm just not understanding it correctly. I assumed trading would mean sending it to my wallet or another address, correct? Also I thought instantly available just meant the balance will reflect in my account. Am I wrong about that?

Lol I already use a credit union. They blocked crypto purchases like I said 
@_date: 2018-11-15 00:49:26
Lol. That's what I was worried.
Luckily, a friend offered to sell me some coin for cash. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 00:21:38
Yeah that would be pretty cool. I kind of want to start one these ATMs lol.

I was surprised because the town I live in isn't very big but we still have one lol. It's all the way across town but I'm about to head there and find out what the fees are and all that

2k mark up? I just need 80 bucks in btc to make a purchase. This has gotten silly lol
@_date: 2018-11-15 00:03:19
Nope. It won't be available to trade for 14 days. I don't just want to look at it, I need to make a purchase. I just learned about btc ATMs though and it's a life saver.
