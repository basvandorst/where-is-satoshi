It's interesting that the FBI actually sold the bitcoin. I suppose they recognised the value of it.
I imagine a lot of digital things that get seized are simply destroyed.

Yeah it sounds drastic but getting a new address or having your mail sent somewhere else (e.g a mailbox service) would be a good idea. For the identify theft stuff, you partly need to cut their access to your mail. Again drastic, but I wonder if a name change would be another good idea? Maybe officially change your middle name or something and not tell anyone? Guess it depends on how serious this issue is.
I'd then go through the process of moving your major services / utilities / whatever to new providers. Go to a new Bank and tell them about the issues you have had. I imagine that a bank out there might help you with additional security.
As for your bitcoin, get a hardware wallet and print your seeds for placement in security envelopes... Then find a secure place to stash them.
Keeping a low profile is ideal (but that sounds out of the bag) so maybe indicate you are getting out of bitcoin or something.

Bitcoin is great but it's a stepping stone to better technologies.
It simply can't compete when new technologies are eliminating fees and mining.
Inb4 million downvotes.

Where are my other shitcoins tho?
@_date: 2018-01-27 15:33:31
I love Bitcoin but they're speaking the truth.
Why set a future direction for Bitcoin when there are other promising technologies that have no fees, are faster and don't require miners.

Political views aside, you're not allowed to just run "free markets".
While Craigslist has its share of illegal stuff I'm sure that their rules specifically state that it is not allowed. Furthermore, I would not be surprised if Craigslist worked with law enforcement to at least try and stay clean.
The Silk Road certainly didn't do any of that, the law states that these markets need to follow certain standards and obviously Silk Road wasn't doing that.
@_date: 2018-01-01 12:41:28
The law disagrees though.
I'm not talking about political or market views. In reality though, Silk Road was different to Craigslist.
@_date: 2018-01-01 11:45:02
Well Silk Road was a criminal market so the customers don't have that much of a right to be upset for their bitcoin confiscated.
It's like leaving your money at the local drug dealer's house and then getting upset when the cops take it during a raid.
@_date: 2018-01-01 12:10:42
That really sucks man.
Seriously... If you're handling that much Bitcoin, just spend the $200 bucks on a good hardware wallet. It's totally worth it.

Mcafee is a dickhead, reverse it to I sell what he says to buy.
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:29:09
Well it's a nice story but I hope it doesn't encourage others to throw all their money into bitcoin.
I love bitcoin but you are batshit crazy to convert all your fiat and live off it exclusively.
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:59:05
Well that is nice up until it isn't.
I'd hate to have all my money in crypto, see a significant dip and then have less money to spend on day to day things.
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:01:36
I wish we had a sub like this then another for all the shit unoriginal memes.
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:02:25
Hahaha oh it's the HODL meme again, so funny!
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:24:58
Sigh, these kinds of posts are the worst.
Stop telling people to blindly HODL meme and encourage people to be smart with their money. You made a good decision at the time with your available information, leading to a significantly positive life changing event.
It's better than holding your Bitcoin perpetually and never spending it... or worse, holding it until a potential price crash. Bitcoin is meant to be used as a currency, not as a store of value.
I've never understood people who get into Bitcoin (or any other investment) without some sort of plan. It's good to have goals and points at which to withdraw some.

I think Buffett recognises the insanely speculative nature of cryptocurrencies (along with manipulation and lack of regulation in the area). Of course anyone from a traditional financial sector is going to be against such things.
By that standard cryptocurrencies are toxic right now, it's just whether you think it will move beyond that though.
@_date: 2018-05-09 06:40:59
I don't think these sort of hostile reactions are constructive.
@_date: 2018-05-18 11:02:31
Buffett is right that Bitcoin is a toxic speculative asset right now.
Just look around you see people buying Bitcoin and holding it in the hopes of making a quick buck off it by encouraging others to blindly buy it (insert HODL meme here). So many people in Bitcoin have 0 interest in the technology or its use cases.
Bitcoin is great though and there is nothing wrong with holding it... hell, it would be even better if more people used it. It's just the people around Bitcoin that are making it a toxic speculative asset that jumps up and down constantly.

This sub has hit a new peak in garbage level posts.
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:35:57
It's a new CryptoCurrency protocol still in the alpha stage, there is nothing wrong with the coordinator protecting the network at this stage.
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:23:18
Other protocols like can fill the domain of fee'less micro-transactions.
I don't see Bitcoin as a great currency to buy small things.
@_date: 2018-02-23 05:11:59
I'm glad this is the top comment.
This sub is really brainless at the best of times.
@_date: 2018-02-20 05:20:58
May I ask your process for withdrawing?
Did you do chunks at a time?
I'm from Australia and I suspect that my bank would freak out and freeze everything if a big lump sum suddenly appeared.
@_date: 2018-02-26 02:21:40
China is maybe closing the gap.
Russia is still an economic backwater compared to the USA.
Compare GDP between the countries, the USA is up at about 20 trill while Russia is still below 5 trill (and they've taken a dip recently too).
@_date: 2018-02-20 05:22:55
Yeah and they can catch multiple transactions as well right?
You can't just spam 5grand until it's all out.
I've often wondered how people withdraw large amounts of crypto without brank problems. I assume there is some sort of process with the bank to declare it and have them investigate or something?
@_date: 2017-09-10 01:41:40
Sure but the reality is that if a Court orders access to your bitcoin with you preventing it, you will have a harsher punishment. Maybe all your assets will be seized or you will go to jail for a long time.
The Bitcoin community act like this is the first time Governments have been prevented from accessing an asset. Reality is they have penalties to force cooperation or recoup what they want. Governments don't just go "Oh gee we can't find his seed, let him free!"
So the Korean decision actually is great and shouldn't be dismissed as irrelevant as some people are saying...
@_date: 2017-09-10 01:50:59
It's like any other asset, the government can only seize what they know about so it's better not to raise bitcoin.
That said if the government does know about your bitcoin, you might be better off just handing it over. After all, preventing lawful government seizure can bring about larger penalties such as seizing most your assets or throwing you in jail for ages.
A Bitcoin seed isn't some magic bullet that prevents the Government from getting you.

I've looked at Prepaid Visas but a lot of them seem to have prohibitive fees compared to things like Bitpay.
@_date: 2018-02-19 13:51:29
Sensible regulation of cryptocurrencies is a good thing, it sounds like they're taking a pretty cautious/measured approach from the article.
@_date: 2017-09-16 07:27:11
My understanding is that in Australia once it becomes cash in a bank account, you need to pay significant tax.
If I have a Bitcoin debit card, it's not taxable because I'm directly using it to buy goods.
@_date: 2018-04-03 05:35:48
How the fuck does that get me a lambo though?
