The "intrinsic" value annoys me. First of all there is nothing in the world that has a natural or basic value. Value is only something us humans apply to things, and the value differ from one person to another based on our need for that thing and our opinion/feelings about that thing. A person lost in Sahara dying from thirst would value a bottle of water higher then a ton of gold.  Right now Bitcoin is valued at about 8 oz of gold.

Interesting however this right here is just an assumption "Despite there being a huge number of long-term Bitcoin holders, no single address holds more than 1% of the circulating supply, hence there are no Bitcoin ‘whales’ which could have the power to crash or manipulate the market."  
Because I myself have Bitcoin in several addresses and I bet I am not the only one. Lots of Bitcoin whales probably also holds Bitcoin in several different wallets.

So no I will not be like Tom I will HODL as if my life depended on it, as it also does.

This my young padawan is how you store your Bitcoin safely.
**tl;dr:** No tl;dr. Taking a shortcut on this and your Bitcoin is gone for ever.
Start out with buying a high quality, six-sided die, then buy a Raspberry Pi (R-Pi). Connect a monitor, keyboard and mouse. Boot it up.
Connect R-Pi to the Internet. Go to [  then use the link on the site under Offline Usage and go to github and download a copy of the site to your computer, check that it is authentic.
Also go to  and save that site to your computer too.
**DISCONNECT THE R-Pi from the Internet and NEVER connect it again.**
Open your saved version of [ on your offline R-Pi. Press “Show entropy details” then choose Mnemonic Length 24 words. Roll your die 99 times, writing down the digit \[1-6\] for each roll. Roll it "randomly" for example, put it into a jar, put your hand over the top, shake the jar with vigor for about five seconds, then dump the die into a box or something. Do that 99 times. Record the numbers. Make sure you have exactly 99 numbers.
Double check that your R-Pi was not connected to the internet. Never connect it again.
Carefully enter the numbers you rolled into the long text area at the top of the web page, where it says, Entropy
Scroll down, find where it says, "BIP39 Mnemonic Below that it says Coin, choose coin for example Bitcoin. Scroll down some more and it says Derivation path, choose what standard you want to use for your Bitcoin addresses, for example BIP44, scroll down some more and you will find your totally random Private Keys. Congratulations!
You're not finished yet. Calm down.
Write down your Mnemonic phrase, very carefully, very clearly.
Double check it, very carefully, against what the R-Pi browser shows. Also write down the private key of the first Bitcoin wallet. Write down the corresponding public address
Double check the mnemonic phrase and private key **again**. Face it: if you fuck up, your BTC will be gone. So, don't fuck up.
Take a moment to think of 1 BTC buying what $1 million buys today.
Then double check what you wrote down at least one more time.
**On a different computer**, go to [  add your **PUBLIC** address. Read the PUBLIC address from the paper you just wrote it on, and type it very carefully after the ...address/ in the address bar. Press "return". Make sure there's no error. If there's an error, you're not being careful enough -- have two cups of coffee and start over at the die-rolling step.
If it shows up on blockchain.com, then go back to your offline R-Pi, did I mention never ever connect it to the internet ever again? Now open  offline press “Wallet Details” and where it says Enter Private Key, you enter your private key. If the Public Bitcoin address there matches your public address typed in at blockchain.com we know you have a functional public address with the correct corresponding private key. Also now all the rest of the keys generated should be valid and you now have an endless amount of wallet addresses generated by your mnemonic seed words/mnemonic phrases seed phrases whatever you want to call them.
**Remember: NEVER connect that R-Pi to the Internet, EVER again. Don't do it.**
**Now remember that seed phrase will give access to all your Bitcoin wallets, not just one but all of them!**
So we have to secure that phrase. The most secure storage is a combination of [steganography]( and trusted relationships.
Take the seed phrase already written down and write the seed phrase on another piece of paper using your own handwritten encryption (like the stuff kids use to pass notes in school) with a separate handwritten key that you can remember. Also, engrave this into a piece of steel. Take a photograph of the piece of paper using a non-WiFi digital camera. Import the photo into a computer that’s not connected to the internet. Using stenographic image encryption software, encrypt your image into another image that seems totally normal, like a family photo. Write down the encryption key and engrave it in a piece of steel, make two copies. Store the encrypted image in a folder with thousands of other photos that seem similar (you can even fake encrypt some of them as decoys) and copy it to 4 USB drives. Print 1 copy (use an old school copier not connected to WiFi) of the encrypted photo.
**Now eat the first piece of paper, then eat the other piece of paper with your handwritten encryption. Wipe the camera. Wipe your laptop.**
You now have **4 usb drives** with the encrypted image on them, 2 physical copies of the image, 2 steel objects with the image encryption keys and 1 steel objects with your handwritten encryption key.
Store one usb drive in your personal safe. Store one of the steel image encryption keys in a safety deposit box. Give one usb drive + the copy of the encrypted photo to a trusted family/friend (this is the only other person besides you who will know what the right image on the usb is but they have no keys). Give one usb drive + the steel copy of the image encryption key to another trusted family/friend (this person has one of two keys but doesn’t know what image to decrypt). Give one usb + the steel copy of your handwritten encryption key to another family/friend.
**The puzzle has 4 pieces. The folder of images, the knowledge of the correct encrypted image, the encrypted image key, and the handwritten encryption key.**
Each of the 3 trusted friends/family has 2 pieces of the puzzle. They need 2 more to unlock it. You however, have all 4 pieces of the puzzle and all are backed by a family/friend. 2 of your pieces are store in your memory (the handwritten key and the knowledge of the image). One of your pieces, the usb with the images, is store in your personal safe and backed up 3 times by your family/friends. Your last piece is store in a safety deposit box that, even if confiscated, cannot be used alone to crack your encryption.
Your Bitcoin should now be safe and you can sleep well at night knowing that when you eventually die your family/friends will have a blast solving the puzzle and reaping the reward of your crypto fortune!

Ok thank you, very helpful. And what derivation path should be used I see one can choose both BIP84 and also a BIP141, they are both generating bech32 segwit addresses. From the information I can find BIP84 is the most common standard used over the BIP141 that I find much less information on.
@_date: 2019-08-26 08:41:59


Thank you for the information. You said " If you start working with single keys from a BIP39 wallet then you are more likely to screw it up than simply using your wallet as was designed." If I interpret it correctly What you say here is that it was designed to implement the seed phrase in to what ever 3rd party wallet provider I want to use to send and receive my Bitcoin. is this correct? 
If so then to me that sounds like more risk, because you expose your seed phrase. But I am not familiar with what  mpk exposure is and googling it said "Methyl Ethyl Ketone  A severe exposure can cause unconsciousness" that does not sound correct to me.
@_date: 2019-08-31 18:55:46

@_date: 2019-08-24 17:44:19
Banks could very well be completely obsolete. Obviously banks have no real use case in a world of cryptocurrency. Coinbase for example can do just the same for those who wishes to store their crypto at a 3rd party, and there can be tons of other companies like Coinbase that will specialize in keeping peoples crypto safe. However I will just hold it myself, I have no need for a 3rd party to hold my crypto. I will probably also secure it better then any bank. 
I also think that with time governments around the world will see that cryptocurrencies are a much better monetary system then today's outdated and insecure, ineffective system. Because of this I think all governments at some point will replace their currency for a cryptocurrency, and where everyone have a bank account with the government and no banks are needed. Those billions banks siphons away every year will go straight to the government. Those billions Visa/MasterCard, PayPal and other payment providers siphons will go straight to the government. Those billions companies like WesternUnion siphons will go straight to the government. And the billions in cost governments use to track criminals and try to stop them from laundering money, will be reduced by 90% probably or more. Governments will sell this to the public as a way to stop drugs, terror, human trafficking and other criminal activity. So in my opinion I see no reason to keep banks around a few decades from now.

Turil lol no you are confused here. You state " But the reality is that whatever device that you get the seed words from and enter into has to be connected to the blockchain somehow. " This is not reality this is your own imagination that is wrong. The device I get the seed words from does not need to be connected to the blockchain, as the blockchain as nothing to do with seed words. You are confusing seed words with the actual Bitcoin private key and public key. I have made tons of Seed words offline that have never touched a online computer and sent Bitcoin to and from the addresses connected to it.
All you do is just take out what ever address you want to use and expose that single address when spending the Bitcoin.  
And you state " Even with a hardware wallet it has to be connected to the internet somehow. Otherwise it's not going to interact with the blockchain" This is again also wrong, because as I try to tell you seed words has nothing to do with a blockchain and have no interaction with a blockchain, you are confusing seed words with the private key and public key of a Bitcoin adresse.

I gave you the wiki page lol read up. You think that the seed words are the Bitcoin addresses it is not. The seed words have no connection to the blockchain what so ever.

@_date: 2019-08-25 19:28:09
Turil the 24 seed words never ever need to be connected to the internet ever. They can be generated offline and stay offline for ever. And I am not talking about generating a 24 word seed on a hardware wallet, although your 24 word seed on the hardware wallet is stored offline, meaning that if your hardware wallet is plugged into a computer infected with malware, your recovery seed and cryptoassets will remain totally secure. That is why people buy a hardware wallet for the air gap it provides. Without it a hardware wallet is useless, you can just as well use a desktop wallet.

So you state  "I am arguing AOL is not going to succed, MSN is not going to succeed etc." To me Bitcoin is not like AOL or MSN it is like the internet. It was not given we would only have one global internet, however it ended up that way but with thousands of smaller intranets world wide. Bitcoin could become that one global internet. 
You state " I know it is being improved, but the development is too slow compared to other cryptos. Technologically there are much better options which will probably be the cryptos that bring blockchain to the masses."  
I disagree with your argument here. Bitcoin has the most developers working on it, the largest blockchain, the most secure blockchain, it is the most battletested of all cryptos and it has by far the best brand recognition among main stream. When you state "Technologically there are much better options" I think this is an overstatement, however without an example of what you are referring to it is hard to argue with it. But just looking at let's say the top 20 coins, very few if none is technologically much better. At least not yet, several of them have promising tech however much of it is still only theory and not tested live or in large scale. Also much of it would be possible to implement on Bitcoin if it turns out great.
As mentioned Bitcoin could become as the one internet is today. Among main stream company executives you now have the completely clueless people who would tell you "It is blockchain, not Bitcoin" and instantly you know they do not know what they talk about. These people will say we want a blockchain as long as it is not the Bitcoin Blockchain. However sooner or later most of them will come around and say it is Bitcoin not blockchain as they get a larger understanding of crypto and blockchain. Just like Microsoft  building their Decentralized identity network on top Bitcoin blockchain. Clearly Microsoft would not have done this if they did think any of the other blockchains where technologically a much better option then Bitcoin. The thing is that you do not really need lots of different blockchains, you really only need one or two, maybe three at the bottom layer and everything else can run on top of them, with lots of transactions going off chain only to be sent to the underlying chain (Bitcoin or ethereum blockchain for example) every 6 hour, 12 hour or 24 hour.

You should watch youtube videos of Andreas Antonopoulos he got lots of good knowledge about Bitcoin for beginners, like the video here.  [ 
And if you are ever to store Bitcoins yourself on your own wallet, never ever show your private key to anyone ever. That is the one and only key that can empty your wallet, who ever has it can empty your wallet. If you do not control your own private key you do not control your Bitcoin, so never store for long term on an exchange like Coinbase or Binance.

I doubt it, however. This is why we need Bitcoin to become more fungible. Because each and every Bitcoin can be tracked all the way back to when it first was mined, you could end up being investigated. If police catch the guy selling drugs with the Bitcoin and seeing you where the one giving/selling/exchanging the Bitcoin with him, they could think you are in some way involved. A drug user, a drug dealer, etc... So you risk being investigated or having a black Van parked outside your house 24/7.

I see many where concerned I typed the seed phrase online. I should probably mentioned it but it was not relevant for my question so I did not even think about it. However thanks for the concerns but I did not type it in online. I have been using paper wallets for years, I am just new to using seed phrases. 
I have a dedicated laptop that was completely wiped with only Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoin paper wallet generators + the  [  Mnemonic phrase generator. So everything is done offline, the laptop will never be connected to the internet and all it has connected to it is a old stupid no internal memory printer that prints the paper wallets and will also never be connected to the internet.

Thank you admin\_default this was a great advice on how to store them securely. I think I will exchange the hardware wallet for Dooglus option in the link generated as Mark Bear suggested it, then use your steps to make sure the physical copies are safe.

Thank you, that is a good suggestions! Because one of my main concerns is that if someone some way gets hold of my seed words, they got full access to my crypto.

Oh my god yes this is so great! and I can add BIP39  passphrase. It does not get better then this. Thanks Dooglus and Mark\_Bear these suggestions are just what I was looking for. 
I cannot for the life of me think there could be any way more secure then this.

Hard to say. Yes it may be an uncorrelated asset. However if the recession is severe enough. People would probably sell Bitcoin to save their house. Or sell Bitcoin to pay down margins so that their stock is not forcefully sold. Do people lose their jobs they might sell Bitcoin to compensate for lost income. So it is really hard to say.

Yes Bitcoin is ground breaking. Never before Bitcoin has anything digital been scarce or unique. Also you do not fully understand what Bitcoin and cryptocurrency is, many of your arguments are passing problems, or problems that can easily be solved. It is like making arguments back in 1993 that internet will never go main stream because it takes 10 minutes to get online, there is almost no content there and you cannot stream movies, hell even downloading a full movie would take a week, so yeah internet will never go main stream. Bitcoin is programmable and being developed. Read up on it :)
