It's basically banking but with bitcoin. They allow you to store euro and bitcoin. 
The angle is that it is a new type of bank with transparency. Because of how bitcoin works Neo can utilize it in ways that are not available with traditional money, like special security where Neo themselves cannot even access your bitcoin holdings with them because your own private key is needed, or time locked accounts etc.
More importantly it exposes the man on the street to bitcoin in a more user friendly way. They don't have to worry about the technical aspects, they just use their Neo account like they would any other bank account, but can still own Bitcoin. It's a great on-ramp for cryptocurrency.

You are forgetting that bitcoin is different things to different people. Generally a dollar on a starbucks card is just that, a dollar that could get them some coffee, so the utility of that item is pretty low and perceived pretty consistently. Even a homeless person is probably not going to risk life and limb for one coffee (maybe some would, but you get the idea). But the perceived utility of bitcoin is vastly different for different people. Some think it is worthless, others think it could be worth $100k a BTC. So anyone who thinks BTC will become vastly valuable, and doesn't have much, is likely to see the prospect of some available free bitcoin too much to just leave it for the next guy to have. 
That, combined with the ease of automating the process of sweeping, and the fact the key can be held by many at once means the account will always remain 0.

Once the price goes &gt; $1000 it will make sense to have a short easy name for regular small transfers. Microbitcoin is the formal term but isn't likely to be used in day to day transfers for a number of reasons. Bit is just what most people have gravitated to calling a uBTC, which in a decentralized ecosystem is what happens. Once you know a bit is uBTC, it's pretty easy.

Because when you are buying something with USD or Euro you are already 'inside' the approved system.

It's generally not really a rational market. It just ebbs and flows on general bitcoin sentiment opposed to the fundamentals because of the amount of 'newbie' investment.
I imagine a lot of people and companies are still plugged into the MtGox API, so their issues are having a disproportionate negative effect on the price. This is one of the biggest 'non-issue' crashes I can remember.
What is happening to MtGox really sucks for the people with money trapped, but well implemented exchanges are not effected and the fundamentals of bitcoin haven't changed, and will actually be improved from this once the smoke clears. The only people that end up getting burnt in these movements are those that panic sell, we see it again and again.

This is true. It takes much of the heat off of BTC as the pump and dumpers can make more from trading super volatile week old alts short term before they collapse than they can with BTC. Innovation is not happening in the altcoin spaces - all the groundwork is being done in BTC, so unless an alt with a legitimate app that pulls people from BTC AND makes them build infrastructure supporting the alt, they just end up drinking each others milkshakes. Alts are good for bitcoin, but ironically, alts are bad for alts.

It is not just the psychology of whole numbers but also the power of making the bit/uBTC the new base unit.
Change tip has been around for a while, the surge in interest is directly related to the fact people can send someone else 0.00001 BTC and it isn't seen as an insult.

You say it has been met but not from a consumers perspective. Bitcoin is 90% of the crypto market share.
No alts are more secure than bitcoin. No alts have faster processing. Faster confirmations are not faster processing. A coin with 4x faster confirmations means you need 4x as many confirmations to be equally as confident in the transaction. You would actually need more because in terms of hash power it's easier to double spend all the other alts combined than bitcoin.

Bitcoin is a protocol. It isn't a Ford, it's the car. It isn't Yahoo, it's html. It is the underlying technology that everything else is being built on. Every one of your concerns can be solved by solutions built into the abstraction layer above the protocol. More accessible to miners is not a driving force in mainstream adoption.

If you have to go there, just outline how mining is about securing the network, not just 'printing money'.

'Fairness' is important to humans, it is part of our survival strategy as social animals and underpins our ideas of justice and law. People are brought up with the notion that wealth is earned. Not just earned through work but 'earned' morally. People believe that if someone is rich it is because they deserve to be: they are smarter, worked harder etc and if someone is poor it is because they deserve it on some level: they are lazy or dumb etc. Of course it is bullshit, but it lubricates the gears of society. Because it is beneficial for us as a species to believe that rich = hard work and smart, we preserve the myth. 
When something like bitcoin comes along it shows us a harsh truth that people are not ready to hear. We live in a random, disorderly, unjust world. If you are in the right place at the right time you can make more money than someone else that works harder than you everyday could possibly earn over 100 lifetimes. People are normally hidden from this. It is handshakes behind boardroom doors and incestuous deals at private functions. Watching Bitcoin is watching it play out in the open. People don't understand 10,000% profit. They were told that 3% was good. Add to this the frustration felt by people that knew of Bitcoin but were too close-minded/fearful to take any semblance of risk and we get a cloud of butt-hurt the size of Manhattan.

I'd imagine many early adopters haven't cashed out at all. They didn't sell at $30, they didn't sell at $266 and they didn't sell at $1200. No doubt many liquidated a small % of their holdings but they invested in Bitcoin back when the only reason to invest was the fundamentals. No media hype, no legitimate exchanges, no shops accepting BTC, just the whitepaper and a vision of the future. They are the least trigger happy when it comes to selling because the reasons they invested in the first place still hold true today, and we are only just getting to the point of legitimate uptake. Why would now be the time to exit?

If you understand how bitcoin works, you will understand why this will never happen. Like, ever. You can fork bitcoin and create tBitcoin with 21 trillion tbitcoins but that is as close as this proposal would ever get, that is why the 1BTC = 1 000 000 bits proposal was made, it is a smoother semantic change opposed to a hard forked protocol change. ie It doesn't require absolute consensus, just people choosing to represent it in this way.

I think the opposite. Remember there is still huge friction on the fiat side. Even if gox pull through people still cant get money in/out, only BTC. Which means everyone inside gox suddenly goes from stockpiling goxUSD to buying goxBTC so they can withdraw, launching the price, probably past $1200 on gox and likely pulling the other exchanges up with it.

I don't think it has much to do with doge other than doge shows us how important the human psychology of owning whole units of something is, even if that thing is digital. Bits are about future proofing the currency in a user friendly way and making the transition from fiat to crypto as smooth as possible. 
The fees are definitely an issue and one of the cons of it is highlighting the large fees relative to nano payments, but generally people are going to understand a currency with a small base unit and lots of digits better than a currency with a huge base unit that few can afford to even own 1 of.
I think the 'bitcoins are too expensive' argument is a greater issue to adoption than 'I can't send 10c because minimum fees are 4c'.

Millibitcoin has been around since the inception of bitcoin and people don't use it. That's not for no reason. micro/millibitcoins and converting back and forth between them is terrible for facilitating quick face to face trade. Counting the decimal places and/or trying to remember how much more a milli- is than a micro- just does not inspire confidence to trade in the average person.
Having a base unit and then just counting up (like every other currency on earth) facilitates trade better and inspires more confidence. Everyone of any language can see that 10 000 bits is 1000x more than 10 bits. The same cannot be said for 10 mBTC and 10 uBTC
Millibits will die and the microbitcoin/bit whatever it is called will become the de facto base unit of the currency. 
The idea that people are going to confuse bitcoin with bits is moot because there are only 21m bitcoins anyway. If bitcoin succeeds no one is going to be trading whole bitcoins.

In fairness he went way overkill on this. If you think about it all you need to do is securely produce a private key and keep it hidden. That's all cold storage is. Once he buys a new laptop just for storage, much of the rest of what he did was unnecessary because the laptop is never touching the internet.
1) get new laptop  
2) disable wifi  
3) install a wallet via USB  
4) generate and record seed/private keys in a few places for redundancy (paper/cd's etc)
That's really it. You now have a secure cold wallet. Encryption in my opinion is overkill because you are never going online and no one else gets access to this laptop. Hide the seed/keys well and that's it. If you split the amount up in cold storage you dont even need to worry about signing transactions or anything just sweep the cold wallets to hot wallets manually as you need them.

People need a reason to actually move to a new coin. A new coin needs to do everything Bitcoin does + everything it's infrastructure does and then some.
Bitcoin is the most widely accepted crypto. In the near future there are going to be 1000's of bitcoin ATM's, a bitcoin bank (neo) and 1000's of establishments accepting BTC, each of which would need a reason to accept this new coin over bitcoin. Then consumers would need to decide (in unison) to avoid using 'the easiest and most widely used' crypto currency in favor of getting and using this new coin.

With MLM, your money goes to the person above you in the hierarchy and once it is "invested" you receive something in return for that money that is of lower value than the money you handed over, allowing profit to flow up the chain towards the tip of the pyramid. 
With bitcoin this isn't the case, the hierarchy is flat and everyones bitcoin has the same market value. You are exchanging your $$ for the equivalent worth of $$ denoted in BTC. Note that if you wanted to you could turn around and sell your bitcoin back to the market for the price you just paid for it, just like if it were gold or a piece of art. This is something you cannot do with a MLM, you are forced to either sell a product with a mark up in order to recoup funds or bring more people in underneath you and convince them to 'invest'.
The only thing bitcoin shares with a MLM/ponzi's is the fervor of its communities and the fact that each is strengthened by each new member joining, but this is the nature of all networks.

Bitcoin is scarce. It's value is derived from a lot of speculation on it's future value (like gold) but also on the fact that in order to use bitcoin (the network), you need bitcoin (the currency) which is what creates a demand. The network is what is 'backing' bitcoin.

The thing with doge is people have it and tip with it and get used to the keys and the blockchain, but then they realize if they want to actually buy something they have more choice using BTC, If they want to send it to their family in portugal they need to use BTC because there are no doge atms or local exchanges. Bitcoin has all the serious developers, capital, infrastructure and innovation. 
If you are a developer trying to do good things in the space are you going to be working on BTC with a 5 year track record or a 2 month old liteclone based on a meme? The alts that do not innovate (the pure clones) will be kept alive for speculation, but have too sparse a landscape to develop into legitimate contenders. There is just no point in putting time and effort into something that is redundant. 
Doge is putting up a brave fight now because it has the momentum and the energy of people that believe they are early adopters (the only reason they approve of doge over bitcoin if they are being truthful with themselves), but the next wave of people, the people who have no reason to use doge over any other crypto are going to go with the easiest to use, the one with most products, apps, exchanges and so on. And that won't be dogecoin.

This argument makes no sense to me. You think people that currently do not use bits for anything are going to confuse bitcoin bits with something else, even though they never otherwise use the term? How do they confuse the word for an alternate meaning that they do not yet know?
The people I see that don't like bits are the people at the opposite end of the spectrum, IT people, CS people who have confirmation bias over how often any kind of confusion relating to bits would come up. To the average person 1m bits in a bitcoin is far more palatable than BTC/mBTC/uBTC/satoshi.

I assumed all of the bitcoin atms did it like this. Relying on a live payout via API is allowing unnecessary risk. Every atm should hold a small amount locally and periodically pinging the exchange to check price/top the float up.
Gives them:
1) Time to be alerted of any API problems.
2) Lessens disruption when something does go wrong ie internet connection failing mid payment.

Any way of transacting bitcoin on the scale you are thinking is going to require a large cash injection to cover the licenses you are going to need. The reason i said ATMs is they are being shipped KYC compliant (to use them you have to give hand print and ID etc), or are just vending machines like Lamassu, so you are leasing the machine and don't have to harbor the regulatory costs as far as i am aware.

A new user will not be using 'millibit' in the first place, because new users will be taught what a bit is. Note that millibit is slang for millibitcoin, there is no contradiction with its use in the same system as a unit bit.


The fact that you think the amount of bitcoin you have has any say in this discussion is also funny. You don't seem to understand that in a decentralized system, the path of least resistance always wins because efficiency always wins out.
A bit is inevitably going to be more popular with the general populous than a uBit or a muBit, the fact that this isn't obvious to you shows me how out of touch you are with how the average person thinks and how trapped in the mindset of a scientist you are.

They can't credit you or refund you if they don't have access to their account. If they can't even get the transaction info they can't be sure who, if anyone, has sent them funds.

Just for clarification, i have no problem getting hold of bitcoins, it is the exchanging of bitcoin to £ and getting those pounds back into my bank account that is the issue.
Small community trading sites have their place but start ups are going to struggle if there is no way of turning bitcoin generated through ventures into legal tender with which to pay their overheads with. 
Startups have enough inherent risk as is without having the added volatility of holding all your revenue in bitcoin.

What he says about poker is true in the respect that in the long run it is a skill game, the money flows to the players who play more optimally over time. The problem is that only around 15% of poker players are 'winning' players, consistently making a profit. So it is more likely that the people you hear this from are losing players justifying their gambling habit, opposed to the skilled semi and full time professionals, but they do exist. I don't know him so i can't comment on him personally. 
It sucks seeing someone that is clearly addicted justifying their losses, but note that it is equally frustrating being told you are a degenerate gambler when you consistently make $50k+ a year from poker.

I think the people that are worried are the ones that invested without really understanding what bitcoin is and why it is as disruptive a technology as it is.
The people that bought in on emotion and are selling now on emotion are what are known in the gambling world as 'marks'. You are the target of manipulation. If people want to buy they spread uncertainty knowing that the marks will bite, sell and allow them in at a better price. If they want to sell they can balloon the price with positive stories that are fake and sell for a nice profit.
Bitcoin isn't going anywhere. The technology isn't going to get uninvented. For the same reason people still torrent, there will always be cryptocurrency. The cat is out of the bag.
You need to make rational investment decisions devoid of emotion. You are not doing that if you are taking investment advice from reddit.
Ask yourself what has actually changed since you bought Bitcoin. If you are thinking of changing your position, and the sole reason is 'the price', then you are the mark.

Nothing has intrinsic value. All value is perceived. An items value is simply the consensus of value two parties meets at in an exchange of goods.
The value of a bitcoin in non-zero because there is demand for it and it is scarce.
Businesses are not using bitcoin as fiat, they are using it as a transactional token across the payment network. For this use the price is irrelevent. The volatility is also irrelevent when using a service such as BitPay as all transactions are converted back to local currency after completion.
Volatility and price is only relevant to holders of bitcoin. To these holders, bitcoin is a commodity that represents an asset that a) hedges against inflation b) allows access to the payment network c) allows access to manipulate the global ledger d) is a speculative tool.
Bitcoin doesn't need stability to fit any of these functions.

Once a Wall Street banker opens up an account at MtGox, the ripples will be felt throughout the blockchain. The miners will brace themselves for the impending weight of transfers and will likely quickly put extra ASIC-mining machines online to protect them from the onslaught of Wall Street bids. The floodgates will open creating monolithic walls on every bitcoin exchange. Servers will fail. Altcoin blockchains will self-delete. Max Keiser will receive a phone call from Obama, grovelling and pleading for him to reverse bitcoin, but it is too late.  Once the one millionth bitcoin is purchased by Wall Street, the foundations of the Federal reserve will shudder and let out their final cries as their fabled walls atrophy and crumble. And in that very second, the ghost of Satoshi will rise out of the ruins, his eyes illuminating the sky with a bright green hue, but not bright enough to blot out the stars, which have rearranged themselves across the night sky, spelling out the message BUY NOW. That's what will drive up the price.

The 'backing' of bitcoin is ultimatley the network. Bitcoin is the unit of 'currency' that travels around the network but it is also *the network itself*. It's value is derived from the need to transfer wealth globally, across borders with no barriers of control. To use this payment network, you need to have bitcoins. This creates demand, and demand creates value.
I think that is a fundamental, base value of btc, then the rest of the value, the speculative value of the 'currency of bitcoin', is built on top of that (much like gold).

We're not adding or taking btc away. We're just changing the notation. 
Increasing the number of decimals does nothing. Before you had 1.005 btc now you have 1.005000 btc. it's the same number, but more divisible. 
1 bitcoin is just 1 21millionth of the total supply. thats all it means. You could make the total supply 210m, add a zero onto every address balance in the world, we've increased the total coin but everyone's ratio stays the same, so the value of everyone's stash of btc stays the same. the total btc could've been any number, it isn't relevent, only the ratios matter.

In the scheme of things it is a very small price to pay if you have actually learned your lesson. You didn't really lose $2k either, you gambled with the 1.7 BTC you had and lost it, the fluctuations aren't really relevant because you were never going to cash out anyway.

The value of a bitcoin is derived from the fact that it has demand and it is scarce, therefore it has value. The fact that the only way to utilize the bitcoin network is with the bitcoin currency also gives it value. Saying that a bit of data can not have value is both irrelevant to the argument against bitcoin and also a false premise (mp3's are data, virtual books are data, etc and have market value).

We all know that 'bit' has about 30 definitions, they are defined by the context in which it is used. No one would send you a single binary digit if you asked for payment in bitcoins. 
It's to do with psychology. People spending $ and getting µbtc's or micro- anything are going to feel like they are getting short changed.

If they are technically savvy i think it's ok, but i think to many people it would be a burden. So now they've got this gift where if they want to actually 'receive' the monetary value ( we know they already have it, but they won't understand that yet),  they have to read up on what a bitcoin is, how it all works, blockchain, privkeys etc. 
People are skeptical enough without being told 'here's some free money, you've just got to...'

This is basically taking your bitcoin off line so they are safe from viruses/hacking etc. It is quite easy to do with bitaddress.org, you can create a wallet, print it out and send the bitcoin to that address so that the bitcoins only exist on that piece of paper.

This comment is what people need to understand. This is how the vast majority of people will see it when they are first introduced to bitcoin, and regardless of what people in the community seem to think, it is a problem. Of course 0.1BTC has the same value as 100mBTC. But psychologically, those numbers are going to elicit different responses when a person sees that value in their wallet.

It's almost impossible to explain to a layman what bitcoin is in a 3 min segment. Likewise with the questions. "Can it be hacked?" Can what be hacked? The bitcoin protocol, not likely, but then the other guy goes of on a tangent confusing individual hackings with bitcoin itself getting hacked and you've got to try and set him straight before someone else interjects with another question about some completely different aspect of bitcoin.

I don't think the problem is having it 'in the cloud', technically every bitcoin is in the cloud it is just protected with enough bits of entropy to be secure. The problem is we don't know the process that was used to secure it. Did you do it in his office? If yes then the security of the passkeys etc cannot be assured.
Its fine having it in the cloud as long as your password is secure (think similar to a privaddress), but i would move any that were secured using a system that you didn't have full control over, you want your keys generated offline in a controlled environment.

Every ddos effectively consolidates bitcoin to the strongest hands. Those that are in it for the long haul are unlikely to be phased by a short term drop in price, only the inexperienced get worried and shaken out of their positions. Over time people a) gain more experience of how the market corrects after a ddos and b) the btc is consolidated into stronger hands and so the market becomes more robust.

Good and bad. Good because IG are a serious global brand, and them taking note if bitcoin is great for its legitimacy and image.
The bad is it makes negative manipulation more profitable. Before a ddos'er always had to buy back into his position before a correction to actually make money from his exploits. Now that isn't the case. They can use options to profit from a fall in price without any direct contact with the market itself.

Nothing will make you more aware of internet safety than having a bitcoin wallet on your machine.
For peace of mind keep a 'savings account' in cold storage and a hot wallet with a smaller amount that you can access right away if you plan on using btc any time soon. Ideally you would save the cold stored btc in a load of different adresses, allowing you to just import them one at a time as you need them.

Cue strategic downvoting. Just choose your favorite OP.
On topic, the way i describe BTC is as an online currency that holds value through its demand, scarcity and ease of exchange.
By using those three points you can compare its advantages over other mediums of exchange that people are more familiar with. Gold? Harder to exchange over distance. Paypal, processor charges, international barriers, etc etc..
If you explain it well enough you can see the cogs turning in their heads, and then sometimes it clicks. "Actually, you might be on to something here..."

The vast majority of Litecoin advocates are people that feel like they missed the chance to invest in btc when it was cents or a few dollars. They are hoping that Litecoin will follow the same growth as Bitcoin (which it won't for various reasons namely the network effect) and so they get into Litecoin while it is 'cheap'.
If another cryptocurrency surpasses btc in the future, it won't be one based directly on the bitcoin protocol, namely because any 'killer app' of litecoin can be implemented in bitcoin easily, and the bitcoin network is order of magnitudes more secure.

Something doesn't have to be hard for it to be burdensome. The human brain isn't built to easily comprehend values with many digits. Try to visualize 100,000 oranges. How much is that? Would they fill a car? A house? a 747? Now try to visualize 1,000,000. 
That's the reason we use units. We can measure the distance from new york to LA in centimeters, but 403,264,873cm doesn't really mean anything to us until we convert it to kilometers or miles and realize, oh right, about 2.5k miles!

I never invested in a mining rig because i never understood the incentive a company has to actually ship its products within a timeframe in which they would mine profitably.
If you think of it game theoretically, everytime a company sells a rig that will mine for example 100 BTC's over its lifetime for less than 100BTC's they are literally forfeiting revenue.
The optimal strategy, considering that they receive the money upfront, is to take the pre orders, invest that money to build the rigs, then mine with the rigs privately until the difficulty has risen to the point where selling the units and mining with them becomes closer to equity neutral, and then send them out, retaining the image of a legitimate company that just had some 'production delays'.  There is currently very little incentive to actually get the units in the hands of the customers while people are queuing up to pre-order.

Those that aren't interested will just throw it away, which is fine, and those that are intrigued will do the research required to find out wtf a bit coin is. Just put on it that it will invalidate in x months, and any addresses that have btc in at that time you can recover.

Its a tough concept to get your head around and people aren't going to start burning their fiat the first time they read about bitcoin. It's a slow burn where the idea is brought to your attention and it sounds crazy, and you ponder it for a while, and then the next time you come across it, it seems less alien, and you start to think why not? The last bubble would have alerted many and perked peoples interest, without them actually jumping in.

Nothing has intrinsic value. All value is perceived. An items value is simply what it can be exchanged for. It is just a consensus of parties. The bitcoin currency is the only way to utilize the bitcoin network, therefore there is some demand. There are 21 million max bitcoins therefore they are scarce. Something that is in demand and is scarce, always has a value &gt; 0.
Bitcoins use as a currency has little to do with it's value. It's use as a commodity does, because its use as a currency through commerce is mostly as a transactional token which is then cashed out the other end, it is zero-sum. Only when transacted coins are 'held' as a money ie something of value itself rather than something that represents value does supply restrict and its value rise.
The rise and fall in price is simply the market trying to find what the fair price of access to an asset that  a) hedges against inflation b) allows access to the payment network c) allows access to manipulate the global ledger.
