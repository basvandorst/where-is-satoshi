I think it's a just a ratio, of


 &gt;'amount of money I made.'
People use facebook, and while I think bitcoin and the core crypto haven't had enough use to qualify as an "obviously overwhelming net good", they may be such in the future.
I guess you could consider it a question of value added.  If people actually *use* it, then you've created something that has a purpose.  Otherwise it's just a transfer of money from buyers to those who start it, and a waste of everyone's time.

Do you mind explaining?

...that's fucking **Brilliant**.  It's like capitalism; utilizing people's base instincts for good, only with corporate raiding (hopefully).
It's like hacking greed.
