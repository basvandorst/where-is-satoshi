I think that the only proof they can get is his amount of coins as I am sure true Satoshi must have one of the biggest amount of bitcoins

If he wanted to hide his money why didn't he just disappeared with money in some undetected direction?but he makes publicy statements and all other stuff... why?

Sorry to hear about that man! That's should be shared as much as possible - people should know about this possible problem they can run into 
@_date: 2014-03-01 11:16:47

If you're going to be involved in Bitcoin, you have to be careful with your clients funds.

That's interesting suggestion but won't you loose more if there is no bitcoin growths? And still no one can be sure in BTC as it is like a currency and as every currency it is volatile.

Can we believe bank that “No customers participated in the pilot”? That's weird to hear that BTC is growing but no one participate in the pilot Bitcoin trading platform in Standark Bank.
