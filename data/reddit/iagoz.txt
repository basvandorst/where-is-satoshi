You're misinformed. Volatility is declining constantly. And even if it wasn't it's still a fallacy - it's like watching a baby and saying that since it's currently crawling it will never be able to walk.

or do you expect people to be irrational and greedy and drive the price up?

were you here? everybody knew the coins will be sold in June. The price raised steadily since April, peaking around the time they were sold.
@_date: 2014-11-04 06:49:33
It was pretty common knowledge those coins are going to get sold and when. My subjective perception could be wrong, but everyone I talked to knew and expected this.
And I don't believe 2 year long trendlines push or pull anything.
@_date: 2014-10-30 04:15:51
@_date: 2014-12-11 23:49:51
So you're saying the price of bitcoin should go down, but because people are irrational and greedy it will go up, and that's why you are holding it?
@_date: 2014-12-11 20:29:48
So again - why do you have a substantial bitcoin position?
@_date: 2014-10-30 15:47:25

@_date: 2014-10-30 14:55:23
the price has importance and you can't deny it. Bitcoin got it where it has because of the price and will need to go further in order to succeed.

I doubt that you are. And no, it doesn't. You're assuming only holders will spend their btc, not rebuy, and this news will do nothing to the legitimacy of bitcoin and will not attract any new buyers. In that case, it means more selling.
@_date: 2014-10-12 19:06:16
Still unsuitable? Perhaps.
There are price-locking mechanisms today. 
But if it's on constant decline, wouldn't the graph suggest that at some point in the future the price will be relatively stable?
@_date: 2014-12-16 06:50:24
it already collapsed after the maidsafe scandal
@_date: 2014-12-11 19:50:54
with coinbase you have auto rebuy. 
One would buy because it adds legitimacy to bitcoin. A lot of people still think bitcoin is used for drugs. Microsoft is one legitimate company they know.
Not to mention - if Microsoft embrace bitcoin, there is a lot of integration they can do with it. This is a company that lost search, social and mobile because they moved too late - and their last CEO got fired for it.

The reason this is bothering you is you sold or you're shorting. Be honest with yourself.
@_date: 2014-10-12 18:20:42
Huge logical fallacy. The fact that the prices are currently volatile doesn't mean they always will be. Volatility decreased tremendously over the years.. 
@_date: 2014-12-15 18:19:20
he's right. The price has been fluctuating between 345-355 for a few days.
@_date: 2014-11-04 05:13:33
As far as I remember the sold Silk Road coins only drove up the price.
@_date: 2014-10-31 05:54:22
Your'e right. If we limit the use to a few pizzas a year, the price doesn't matter.

Thanks for the AMA.
Remember that this is from a freshman point of view. The Bitcoin Project is pretty active and there were hundreds of participant in their summer project. Also, at Grad level or above - everybody is familiar with bitcoin. I'm pretty sure it's also the case with more senior undergrads.

Looks like its more of an ad hominem attack against them than against bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-12-11 20:19:34
People who have no money to spare will not buy anything.. that's besides the point.
I didn't say it for itself will make people buy. But it is adding legitimacy, and the mere fact they are adopting it (which unlike paypal was totally unexpected) is a very positive signal to me.
If you feel so gloomy about the price prospect, why aren't you selling?
@_date: 2014-12-05 20:46:41
Coinbase is a btc/usd gateway.. Once you have the btc you can move it to an actual exchange and trade there. Exchanges are more sophisticated trading platforms and charge lower fees.

When bitcoin goes over 1k again, for sure! ;)
@_date: 2015-01-16 13:08:46
I think it makes a lot of sense Mark was DPR. 
From reading the court filling seems unlikely that the amount stolen by the employee was so huge.. he said he's more worried about silencing him than getting the money back..
If indeed at some point a lot of bitcoins were stolen than it might make some sense... but I doubt it.
There were so many shady things about Mark and the last days of gox which are unexplained. Look how he's lying [here]( "Each time you want to check the balance of a cold wallet, you're making it less cold".. And his entire demeanor was strange. And what was the deal with litecoins?
I honestly can't find one reasonable explanation to everything that happened besides him being a total psychopath.

Totally agree. Logs could very well be faked. Driving the price up while short on btc doesn't make any sense... if anything should have dumped his personal stash of 200k and rebuy for cheap.
@_date: 2015-01-17 17:34:13
So what they are doing should decrease bloat... instead of uploading one hash per one piece of data, uploading one hash for multiple pieces.. can also determine the order between them.
For more info on OP_Return and bitcoin scripting - 
So putting the data on the blockchain is actually not scripting, it's a hack, using the memory reserved for the script to add additional data to a transaction.

I'll tell you one story from Vegas.
Went to XS club, paid 1200$ for 2 bottles of Vodka. Did a bunch of MDMA also. Don't remember much from the club, later I found out one of my friends got in a fight and they kicked us out of the club.
6 AM. I'm at the roulette table, which I never play, more of a poker guy. Had 200$ in my pocket. Put it on red. Red comes. Was in a good mood and started chatting with everyone in the table. There was a girl there who claimed she was Saudi royalty, went to Harvard, and engaged to some prince. Also some nice Irish guys. Put another 200$ on red. Red comes again. Started talking to the girl about politics. Put my profit, 400$ on red. The entire table bets red, thinking I'm some sort of psychic, must have been like 3k. Black. Everyone leaves the table...
5 minutes later I somehow find myself making out with the girl in the slot machines. The girl tells me to come with here to her room. We're at Ancore. I follow her, she went to the elevator of the suites. We get in the elevator, she presses one of the highest floors, must have been a 4k a night room. I put my hand up her dress in the elevator. We get to the door of her room. I try to go in and she's - you can't come in, my body guard is there. I'm like, I don't give a fuck about your body guard. I try to come in and she shuts the door in my face.

The way I understand it, they are extending proof of existence.
Proof of existence is taking a document, hashing it, and placing the hash on the blockchain in a transaction below OP_return. That way you can later prove the document existed at the time the block was generated.
What they are doing is to make a block of these hashes, hash it, and then place that hash on the blockchain.
And streamlining the whole process with an API

It's a rumor someone spread that some people decided was a fact.
They claim he had a bot on the site pushing up the price. They also say he lost some btc sometime in 2011. If he lost the btc, why would he push the price up is beyond me...

Price has been around 300 for 3 months now... with shorters drawing graphs how we're going down to 280/240, depends who you ask. Hasn't happened yet.
It reminds me of the summer. At the end of the bull run the price settled around 600. For 3 months everybody was waiting for the moon and wall street to come and it never did, which led to the bear run... So now everyone is waiting for the price to drop way below 300 and it doesn't really, or at least hasn't yet.
Thing is for new money to come in, the price needs to go up... for the price to go up, either new money needs to come in, or traders need to be convinced bear trend is over.
The unregulated market is hurting the price. Every single drop in price for about 3 months came at China time... before that we had fake china bans bitcoin news. 
A lot of people are waiting for an ETF. That could be good, but also just a regulated exchange in NYC... there are several firms competing to be first to market. There is fairly a lot of clarity re the regulation, and they have been working on it for over a year, seems like it could happen q1... or not.

I think the idea is speculators buy bitcoin for it's future prospects, just like FB was worth 1B when it didn't make a cent... and then use cases would become feasible.

Cost of running scripts is the same as transaction fees. As long as miners accept it, it's valid. So I see it tied up to a universal value (USD, BTC, ETH, whatever) more than anything else..
Right now, people trade bitcoin. It's the most developed use case. I suspect it will be the biggest use case for ether also at the beginning... lots of demand for it.

Some things to think about - 
Gox claimed they are redeploying their site, 'soonish', and all that... but they did that while exchange and deposits were still up. Had a reason to pretend everything will be ok. Bitstamp is closed for deposits, what do they have to gain from lying about it?
They guy redesigning the site probably has little to do with fixing the security issue.
They are probably more concerned at fixing their issues than doing the proof of reserves at the moment. They will probably publish it before they redeploy.
Pantera - might not want to add 5 more million, but if this money doesn't show up from somewhere they lose their 10m investment.
@_date: 2015-01-25 22:38:49
Currently they are not an exchange, they are a btc gateway.
Right now, you can't place market, limit, stop, etc orders on coinbase. You can just buy/sell through them at whatever price they offer.
For people who want to buy into btc it doesn't change much. But for traders, it's totally different as they would never buy from coinbase.
@_date: 2015-01-11 14:40:03
How blockchain.info works - 
When you create an account, a private key is generated on the front end with some entropy collected. That key is encrypted with a deterministic hash of your username/password and uploaded to their servers. They keep a different hash of your username&amp;password to verify you when you log in. Each time you log in you download the encrypted wallet which is decrypted at the front end. If you make a transaction, the transaction is generated and signed on the front end and then broadcasted to the network by blockchain.info's node. 
According to this scheme, they do not have access to your bitcoin. But - 
1) You don't check the code every time you log in. They can change it, or get hacked, or get a subpena, and send themselves the decrypted copy or your actual username/pass.
2) They sometime make changes to their front end code which can result in mistakes. See what happened about a month ago here - 
@_date: 2015-01-15 13:24:59

Ethereum is not just another altcoin, very far from it. It offers important functionality that can never exist on the Bitcoin blockchain... it's not a question of network affects since ethereum is a different product.
This can play out in 3 ways:
1) Etherum launches, it works, people start using it, startups build upon its smart contracts, and eventually, since everybody is already using it, it replaces bitcoin's currency function as well.
2) Sidechains are launched soon enough with an ethereum clone that is as good or close to being as good. People have no reason to switch and the network affects and better security win, ethereum dies.
3) The two blockchain live side by side. Ethereum is for smart contracts and decentralized apps, bitcoin is for payments, store of value... other use cases (asset registration, etc) will split between the two.

I understand your position and you are right, the community is overzealous and off putting sometimes. I think a lot of it is because there are so many actual trolls in this subreddit, so the community has adapted this 'everyone is against us' mentality.
Too bad you're going to miss the moon. Good luck!

It was a bad call because if I had fiat left I would buy everything right now..

Well I'll always be in the green since I already spent 40x what I invested... but the one thing I can tell is that everything in life is relative... to what you used to have and what your friends have.

What is the difference between the two?
@_date: 2015-01-14 23:38:25
Makes sense, they have salaries to pay in fiat. Plus, they are the bitcoin killer, declining prices are good for ethereum.
@_date: 2015-01-15 10:42:09
I did. In February 2013 I visited switzerland, tried to open a bank account and deposit 150k. They didn't like that bitcoin was the source of my money :) oh well...
@_date: 2015-01-14 23:09:54
I know :)
@_date: 2015-01-03 15:48:51


I think this is a fallacy.. in the summer the price was double and the market was able to hold it for around 3 months with very low volume.
@_date: 2015-01-15 13:13:06
thanks! yep...
@_date: 2015-01-16 15:09:22
the other way around... needs higher market cap to be useful and more stable.

100 mil valuation for an obscure bitcoin company is not bad

Questions is loaded, they are happily accepting deposits but also processing withdrawals.
Why do you hang around this sub if you have such a negative opinion of bitcoin?

I'm the first person to admit my delusions, but willy is as unsubstantiated as any other random claim around here.

Bitcoin needs a trading partner..
Thought at the time, I didn't think about that much. It was more about diversifying. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:49:47
The collapse of mtgox was a very very bad event for bitcoin, I agree.
I don't think it can go much lower, and I also think you're an idiot if you sell after a 40% daily decline for no reason.
But I've been very wrong about the price the last few months.

No taxes, but I'm not an American

yeah I get your point.
Another BS - how can a cold wallet have a leak?
@_date: 2015-01-19 11:23:59
Your holding will be legit in both chains as of the time of the fork. However, if you think one chain will be more dominant that the other, perhaps you'll sell you btc in one chain and rebuy on the other.

Made a lot of mistakes but totally worth it.. but I guess somewhere in between. Money doesn't make you happier, but it is easier.


Bitcoin related :) more precisely, blockchain related.
@_date: 2015-01-21 15:28:20
This is the equivalent of setting up your own nuclear bunker. Your grandmother probably shouldn't do this, and use Xapo or Coinbase instead.
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:53:59
We can also short, but I don't think I'll ever be able to short bitcoin :)
@_date: 2015-01-16 16:29:30
I completely agree.. he's either an idiot who got in over his head and is being framed or a complete genius. There are a lot of strange things about his behaviour. Third option he's just a psychopath... see how he's trolling here 
@_date: 2015-01-16 11:44:01
I can't understand how people bought this willy nonsense.
- if he's short on btc and high on cash, maybe a better strategy is to lower the price instead of pumping it?
- how does buying coins with a bot pay commission?
- How did he lose 750k bitcoins? 
@_date: 2015-01-02 10:18:57
It was over 400k coins though...

You'll get (some) of them back. Some can be 10%, and some can be 30-40%. Probably around 20%.
@_date: 2015-02-08 22:25:13
Absolutely no fucking way 400 million were lost. No way that 15% of bitcoins in existence were invested into this company.
@_date: 2015-02-13 03:03:57
this just proves they are completely centralized.

Yes, those two banks, fired him as CEO because they knew he will make this interview in the future. Spot on.
@_date: 2015-02-12 19:58:55
would probably be a mostly stock deal... changetip last time raised 3.5 so their valuation should be north of 10 mil.. Coinbase are not going to spend their cash on this. They didn't raise it for m&amp;a, but rather to have enough runway even if the price will still struggle for another 2 years.
@_date: 2015-02-12 18:37:11
if you can both deposit and withdraw bitcoin then this is the biggest use case other than black market at the moment imo. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 17:25:07
I guess the other lesson is if you use a service like coinbase use your wallet like a real life wallet, only hold their like 100$ at a time. 
Sorry for your loss, sucks to get stuff stolen.

He's that author of this 
And he's a member of the Facebook board
Still unlikely they will add bitcoin support. FB is a closed platform and I suspect they would first try to push their own currency.
@_date: 2015-02-13 15:24:54
this is a very misleading statement. They sent costumer satisfaction polls through a third party.
@_date: 2015-02-03 15:30:24
No, they accept bitcoin. Bitpay process their bitcoin transactions. Just like most websites use Stripe or similar service to process credit card transactions.
What short term effect this would have on the price is a different matter. Long term it's building the bitcoin economy.
@_date: 2015-02-06 11:05:34
Good story. Too one sided.
Seems like PR for Ripple.
@_date: 2015-02-12 20:54:11
Don't think they are losing the merchants business.. Bitpay were first to market. Bitpay have more merchents but almost all the 1B merchents are Coinbase's... they have an advantage with tech startups being in the valley.

You don't have to operate in all exchanges. The price on Coinbase follows other exchanges.
