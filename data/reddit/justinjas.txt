Anyone else find it ironic that the lawyer representing Mt. Gox in the bankruptcy is Mr. Kobayashi.  Makes me imagine Karpeles is just acting like a complete buffoon but is really Keyser Soze and making off with all the coins.

Also use this wallet, even contributed some pull requests that made it back in.
So far I haven't ran into any issues with it.  Should note though the author was surprised to see others using it at this stage.  So obviously don't put a lot of BTC on it.

Done, sent them some BTC.  I'd do the same for Wikipedia if they proudly showed the Bitcoin logo on their donation banner like this.

FWIW this isn't my shop or anything.  I'm just a bitcoin user in the Raleigh-Durham area and I was excited there is finally a place I would go to and use my BTC.

Not true with this app.  Since you are ordering physical goods you can enter your credit card information directly to them, in fact that's the only option.
It's clear Apple is specifically out against bitcoin.

Nice, I'll be trying them out as well.

I originally hadn't given bitWallet a chance because I thought the pushtx workaround was too much of a pain but it really isn't bad at all.
I'm wondering if anyone has considered making an iphone app that's sole purpose is to send a copied transaction in the clipboard to the bitcoin network.  I might actually make that and see what happens.  I'm more curious about what specifically Apple deems as being illegal (which I think is the reason they have given before).   Would an app that just submits raw transactions be considered banned, or is it the combination of that with a wallet.
@_date: 2014-07-17 16:53:52
Would just like to add that the 3 day warm up period with PPLNS will also ramp down when you move or stop mining so you aren't really losing this time per say just deferring it.
@_date: 2014-03-03 20:53:08
Thanks for the clarification.

Yeah using safari works fine, I'm just kinda curious how much Apple can be pushed on this subject.
I am a developer and have an account that is mostly unused (just an old iOS game that still makes enough to leave the account open) so I'm considering making the app.
If I did I would probably use some of the source from  and have it be a real SPV client just with the only feature being to submit raw transactions from the pasteboard.
We'll see, I'm tempted to do it just as a middle finger to Apple.

So I remember reading on gox's site that they would reconcile trades if the value was 5% outside the converted amount.  So for example if the value on USD/BTC dropped from $600 to $500 any buys in the JPY order book that were between $570 and $525 would get automatically arbitraged into the USD sells as the price fell there and gox would pocket the 5%.  Is that not what this is?
@_date: 2014-08-07 12:49:23
If you trade alt coins on there they cut their fees in half (from .2% to .1%).
For fiat trade pairs the fee went from .3% to .35%.  I don't understand the sensational title to this post, I don't see any fees that doubled.

For context it beat out Inputs.io, Heartbleed, and the Target breach.

My first thought as well, also wonder if it's the same grouped that hacked Poloniex as well.  Could just be a copy cat attempt after it was shown how vulnerable hosting providers can be.

That's not true in this case. since Fancy sells physical goods Apple lets them do purchases via credit cards in the app (as in you input your credit card details and bypass iTunes).
So the 30% cut excuse seems to have no baring on Apple's bitcoin policy.  As someone with Apple products it's all very depressing, just tonight I took a look at what the Android landscape looks like to see what my options are.
@_date: 2014-03-08 05:48:54
There are multiple comments claiming that Apple has requested the bitcoin feature be pulled because they are trying to bypass in app purchase.  I would like to point out this is wrong as the only other way to purchase through Fancy is to supply your credit card directly.
Since they are shipping physical goods Apple allows this instead of forcing in app purchase.  It's clear Apple is specifically out to remove bitcoin transactions from their app store in any way shape or form.

Agree that Simple is bitcoin friendly.  I had to move a large amount through them that triggered a form they had to file for compliance and they asked where the funds originated from.  They had no issue with me saying it was from selling bitcoins.

I can't tell if he just doesn't trust the value or what, he just withdrew 1.92 out of 1.94 of the BTC balance.  Maybe he just wants to see how moving larger amounts of USD out of it will work.

I also commented to ask him to prove it by signing an old address as this could just be a troll account.

BTC sale price - BTC purchase price = capital gains (or losses)
If you are trading BTC for goods or services just use the daily price from a site like bitcoinaverage.com.
Given the decline of BTC this year you could have a $3k deductible to offset your bitcoin loses.
I'm sure by April 2015 there will be software to handle all this, just keep track of your addresses and it should figure it out for you from the blockchain.

Coinbase was around then, he didn't have to use gox or localbitcoins.
@_date: 2015-03-04 03:38:20
This isn't that surprising to me.  Think about it.  If criminals have found an easy way to exploit adding credit cards to apple pay then a higher number of transactions are going to be fraudulent because of the low use of apple pay from the general public (compared to swipe card use).  So percentage wise it's high but numbers wise it's probably still very low.  I would imagine if/when apple pay gets more widespread use the percentage would drop.

I just had to move some USD from a stock trading account to my bank and from my bank to coinbase.  Whole process took two weeks.  I moved a similar amount of Bitcoin to coinbase in under an hour.

Seems like the sinking Titanic over there with their hash rate bleeding down to 18GH/s.  I only had a couple bitcoin as well so not a big deal, and I've moved my mining over to Slush and Eligius with no intention of returning to 50BTC even if they get their act together.

I saw you gave all your Reddit BTC to someone in so I felt compelled to grant your wish.  Do whatever you want with it.
