No you don't mine bitcoin anymore ,  at least not for any profit.

Yep we put our savings in and once we profited the amount of our initial investment amount we withdrew our savings and now what is growing is just what was earned.  So a crash would be sad but we still have our nest egg :)

Wallet didn't make a recommendation and to be honest had no idea was the first time moving it off the exchange.  So am I basically screwed now or will it eventually go through?

Yeah did my first ever transfer 2 days ago and still shows unconfirmed on the blockchain. Pretty dissapointed to be honest. I know alot is going in but 48 hours is a bit much.

Bitcoins are actually shaped like a small unicorn riding a jet ski.

You can't out train bad diet it's a fact. So again his statement is true, you could do thousands of sit ups a day but if you have a layer of fat over your abs and you aren't creating a calorie deficit then you aren't going to see those abs. No offense but I'm a certified strength and conditioning coach and have spent many years helping clients get those abs and exercise is only 10% of it. As you gain muscle you do burn more calories whilst in a resting state so it does get easier in time to create a calorie deficit and burn enough calories to lower your overall body fat percentage to a low enough level to reveal your abs. But training your ass off in the gym then heading to Wendy's for a burger and a thickshake are going to erase most workout sessions.

You're right you really can't read and yes going to the gym and burning 1000 calories then eating 1500 calories right after does erase the workout,  of fucking course not going to the gym and eating 1500 calories is way worse   that's how math works genius. I am simply saying if you want abs then diet is 100% the most critical part because 99% of people can't physically train hard enough to create a deficit with a horrible fucking diet.

I think he is saying diet is how you reveal your abs, of course you can train them but without diet and low body fat you won't ever see them.
