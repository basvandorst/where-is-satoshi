Productivity and wealth have risen tremendously over the past 100-200 years. And yet the resulting effect on society so far has been an increasingly delusional sense of entitlement. Poor people feel entitled to welfare, successful people feel entitled to perpetual profits. And that's the kind of shit that makes governments thrive.
We're going to need more than just prosperity to break that cycle of dependence. If we don't, the movie Idiocracy is probably the best case scenario of where we're headed.

Perhaps they're just moving them to a more secure wallet. If you look at those old coinbase transactions, they all went to plain public keys.
If one day it becomes possible to crack secp256k1 public keys, you don't want to be one of the people with large amounts of bitcoins in addresses with known public keys. This is because an attacker has all the time in the world to crack those keys. If you practice proper address renewal, it will only become a real problem once the cracking time is getting close to the typical block generation time, at which point the issue has most likely been publicized and addressed.

You've just spelled out why pool mining is so popular these days:
* Pool operators don't carry much risk. All they have to make sure is they can cover their operating costs through the mining fees and they don't accidentally misplace any mining rewards.
* Pool miners don't have to invest in hugely expensive hardware (which will be obsolete in a couple of months) to get a steady payout out of mining.
The bigger a pool is, the steadier the payout it provides to miners and the more likely it is (through natural selection) to be competent and efficient at what it does.
The problem is, the pool operators aren't just coordinating. They are also controlling which transactions get included in a block, which is a problem if Bitcoin wants to stay neutral.
Hence, I believe it would be desirable to shift some of the risk and control back to the ones who actually do the POW. How exactly that would be best done, I'm still not too sure about.
One thing I really like about Bitcoin is that once you've wrapped your head around some of the concepts, it really is astonishingly simple. By introducing elaborate schemes to modify the POW, I'm a bit afraid of losing that simplicity. If that happens, Bitcoin will become even more intransparent for newcomers, which could be a bad thing for the necessary further adoption.

Well, there is P2Pool. The fundamental problem with that is that the individual miners need to run a full bitcoin node whereas they don't need to do that when mining on a centralized pool. This means that it's generally more expensive to do solo mining (or quasi-solo mining as in P2Pool).
The approach I outlined in the OP could help make the mining problem just a little bit less outsourceable (e.g. by choosing a value for alpha that is closer to 0, like 0.1).
Unfortunately, the proposed approach doesn't quite work for P2Pool-style mining since it assumes a single output public key. However, the coinbase transaction in a P2Pool block contain payouts to all the individual miners, each of them with an individual public address (see for example [Block 307165]( Perhaps it could be adjusted to accommodate that but I haven't thought it through yet.
Edit: You could maybe allow each of the outputs to generate a block header signature (and each of them needs to include their individual value r). In the block header, you would add just the signature of the one participant who found the winning block.
You'd need to make the target evaluation dependent on the payout percentage though or otherwise there would be an incentive for pools to create coinbase transactions with lots of small outputs. I guess this could be done by simply adjusting the difficulty inversely proportional to the payout percentage of the associated public key.

If you use [blockchain.info]( as a wallet provider, you can attach these kinds of notes to any transaction you make and they will be publicly displayed along with the transaction.
They aren't actually stored in the Bitcoin blockchain, i.e. you can only read them when looking at the transaction on [blockchain.info](

That might turn out to be rather difficult considering nobody knows what continent Satoshi even lives on.
Instead, I would simply suggest he take a small ASIC farm with him. About 10 PHash/s should be more than enough.
He then ramps up the hashing power during 2009-2010, first slowly then increasingly faster.
After reaching full speed, he keeps it going for a couple of weeks. At that point, Bitcorn sends all his mining rewards to 1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE and turns off the miners.
The expected block time for the CPU and GPU miners of 2010' is now decades, rendering Bitcoin useless as a means of exchange. The concept of cryptocurrencies will be considered failed due to the enormous hashing power behind Professor Bitcorn's attack. Conspiracy theorists will try putting the blame on the Reptilian Illluminati Globalists.

No problem. It was your post that got me thinking the most, I definitely appreciate the input.
The economics of running a full node vs. a pure miner don't quite make sense to me either. I assume it is still significant because miners tend to operate on very thin margins so even a seemingly trivial overhead could push them out of profitability.
As for my edit, it was put together a bit hastily I admit:
The idea is that every single output in the P2Pool coinbase transaction carries with it a pre-computed value of r which will be used by that miner to calculate block header signatures.
From there, any one of the coinbase outputs can calculate one individual signature hash y per nonce. To level the playing field, that value is then multiplied by the total coinbase output value and divided by the individual output's value, i.e. insert the following step before calculating z:
y' = y*totalOutputBtc/individualOutputBtc
Then calculate z using y' instead of y.
I'm not so sure if that change would help very much in disincentivizing centralization. It should be able to accommodate P2Pool miners. But I don't see any fundamental reason that keeps centralized pools from creating the same type of coinbase transactions as P2Pool does...
Perhaps there's something I'm currently overlooking. I'll probably keep working on the idea in the back of my head for another couple of days or so.

I don't see how this process is enabled/improved by the existence of the Bitcoin blockchain. It just uses a Bitcoin address/private key for authentication.

The address doesn't actually have to exist on the blockchain and you're not storing any information in the blockchain when you perform an authentication.

Why not just do away with X and Y and define this target instead:
(SHA256(SHA256(header))) * (SHA256(SIG(header, privkey))) &lt; ((1/(difficulty * 2^32 )) * 2^512 )
I hope the idea is somewhat clear. You multiply the two 256Bit numbers, resulting in a 512Bit number and check that against the difficulty. You wouldn't even have to change the difficulty adjustment algorithm.
disclaimer: I haven't quite thought through the economic arguments but it seems this would give a benefit to solo miners since they can check smaller half-solutions more frequently against the signature POW factor. Pools would have to define a higher target for the half-solutions because otherwise they'd effectively get DOS'd pretty quickly I assume -- that or their infrastructure costs might rise considerably making them less competitive.
@_date: 2014-06-25 09:37:47
Overall, you are correct. It doesn't really matter how many people mine on a pool.
What it does, however, incentivize is for the people who have the hashing power to also control the private key for the reward payout: The bigger the value of alpha, the bigger the incentive.
For alpha = 0, virtually nothing changes compared to the current situation in Bitcoin mining.
For alpha = 2, the POW is completely unoutsourceable since all you're doing is calculating signatures with your private key and checking the hash of that.
For alpha = 1, the POW is kind of outsourceable. A pool operator can let miners find nonces that result in a small value x, which is helpful in getting a small value for z: 
x &lt; M/(2^32 * target) implies z = x*y &lt; M^2 /(2^32 * target).
However, there is a chance that a nonce will lead to values x and y that satisfy the difficulty requirement even though x doesn't satisfy the pool target. Since the miner has no idea what value y results from their nonce, they will have to throw away that nonce even though it would have been a winner -- causing a potential reduction in efficiency.
The pool could lower their difficulty target in order to reduce that waste. But I imagine that would lead to an excessive use of bandwidth for miners and pool operators, which still causes extra cost.
This effect is more or less pronounced the higher or lower alpha is chosen. As I stated in the OP, I can't myself really tell which value of alpha would have the most desirable effect. All I can say is that the mechanism I outlined would make it possible to gradually change to that value of alpha should it be necessary. If it turns out that alpha = 0 is already ideal, we might as well not do anything at all of course.
@_date: 2014-06-19 16:58:44
I don't see any reason why there should be more than one nonce in the block header. Even if the article doesn't explicitly state it that way, that is certainly the way it should be implemented.
@_date: 2014-06-09 17:10:03
If the difficulty becomes so high that mining isn't profitable anymore, the hashrate will drop. That will cause the difficulty to get adjusted down until mining is profitable again.
As long as at least one miner is out there, we will eventually get to those 21 million (minus some arithmetic artifacts). There's absolutely no way around it unless there is a hard fork that fundamentally changes those rules.

IQ is by definition normalized to a Gaussian distribution with mean=median=100 and standard deviation 15 (usually) and thus the average IQ is by definition identical to the median IQ ([this is what it looks like]( The distribution you're suggesting is not Gaussian and therefore not an IQ distribution (at the very least, the population sample is too small and irregular for there to be a reasonably continuous distribution).
The thing is that IQ is purely a comparative measure and not an absolute one. If you have two people A and B with IQs 110 and 130, you just know that:
* Person B is more intelligent than person A.
* There is a specific percentage of the total population that has a higher IQ than A and a lower IQ than B
* The percentage of people with IQs in between them can be estimated fairly accurately from the IQ distribution. 
However, you don't get a measure of how **much** more intelligent B is than A. Therefore the idea of an average IQ is relatively meaningless anyway.

I'm sorry, I can't quite follow your argument. How would a pool operator be able to outsource the cost if not by outsourcing the signature calculations in the case alpha = 2? Just outsourcing the hash calculation wouldn't make sense if the pool already had to calculate an ECDSA signature for every single nonce.
If they were to hand out the private key to untrusted miners, those would be able to spend the block reward of any block that is found by the pool, which would be an unmanageable risk.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to push this idea no matter what.
Maybe you're right (indeed, I personally hope so) and the large concentration of hashing power behind a single pool disappears on its own once the ASIC market stabilizes, which should happen over the next year or so. That or it turns out that no single pool can hold on to 50% of hashing power for any extended period of time.
Then again there's a chance you're wrong. Perhaps some government entity starts controlling a single pool and offers higher payout (at taxpayers' expense of course) while censoring transactions from being confirmed. I'm not entirely convinced that miners would be properly incentivized to switch pools should that happen given that the pool offers better payout than any other. After all, they're not the ones being targeted by censorship.
For that possibility alone, it is important to discuss our options -- even if we hope we'll never have to implement them.

Then the pool would cease being a pool and instead be operating as a solo miner. I don't see how they interact with smaller miners in that case.
In the case alpha=2 you have to calculate an ECDSA signature for every single nonce you're trying to evaluate. If the pool already has to calculate an ECDSA signature for each nonce, they might as well calculate those 2 SHA-256 hashes to find y because that costs them less time and energy than making others do that work.
The point of pooled mining is to make miners do work on billions and trillions of nonces per second. For alpha=0 (i.e. today) that is easily possible since there doesn't have to be a lot of interaction between the pool operator and the miners. As alpha increases, the amount of interaction between the pool and its miners gradually increases until it reaches a tipping point where it's no longer economically feasible.

The reason it isn't done very often is because people are used to username+password authentication and certificate management is apparently too difficult. Using a blockchain doesn't improve the usability at all.

His PhD was revoked because of plagiarism. Who even gives a fuck? Academic accomplishments are hugely overrated anyway. If that's the worst thing he's done, he'd be a saint compared to just about every other politician out there.

He comes across as a total narcissist. Having an awful childhood and then becoming rich and famous will do that to you. What's clear is that he is an intellectual lightweight.

Would you be happier if they shipped locked hardware for 19 USD and then required a payment of 100 USD to unlock it over the internet?

That's because there is literally no alternative. Either you use ECDSA to sign transactions or you don't use Bitcoin at all.

The point being that diamonds, unlike gold, are neither fungible nor divisible and not as durable either. You can trade and hoard them but they are not suitable to be used as money.

How do you know that? It's completely plausible that the raw production + shipping cost of the device is $20. They could probably sell it at that price without losing money. 
They would just never recover their development costs.

LTC/BTC has been fairly stable at about 0.011 BTC these past few weeks so it's not like Bitcoin's loss is Litecoin's gain. The rest of the altcoins are pretty much irrelevant and/or scams.

You're mostly right about that. The problem with statism is that the state constantly claims to be exempt from those fundamental moral rules in the interest of the perceived greater good.
Individualist anarchists reject this on the ground that there is no such thing as legitimate political authority, even in a democracy. This is the fundamental disagreement that we have and no re-labeling will get around it.

I'm an individual. I have the right to not be bothered and to voluntarily interact with other individuals however we see fit. If you are opposed to this, then I consider you to be hostile. If not, I don't care what you do.


The gold standard doesn't compare to Bitcoin at all because it was extremely fragile. It relied on the government actually adhering to the limitations imposed by the limited supply of gold. When the government started creating too much money to fund the war, they just got rid of it.


In a society that is dominated by statist ideology, anti-ideological movements like libertarianism do indeed look like they're ideological which is what I was trying to convey with the word "other".
What's your anti-ideology then? Flip a coin before every decision you make?

I'm not convinced that a blacklist of forbidden keywords is the way to go here. What you definitely need to do though is resolve all unicode escape sequences (i.e. \u1234) inside a submission before running the blacklist check.
Resolving unicode escape sequences is pretty much the first thing a Java compiler does with a source file -- even before it removes comments.
As for the actual penetration, I haven't been able to do anything of interest. For example:
    //"\u0054\u0068\u0072\u0065\u0061\u0064" means "Thread"
    \u0054\u0068\u0072\u0065\u0061\u0064 t = new \u0054\u0068\u0072\u0065\u0061\u0064(); 
    t.run();
gives me

I'm assuming you're using some kind of obfuscation that I couldn't be bothered to analyze further.
Reflection didn't really appear to work right away either.

Oh I agree with you. I was just pointing out that diamonds are a substantially worse money than gold.
I imagine in larger valuations, payment with gold is somewhat practical. For everyday use, it's way too much of a hassle.

What's interesting is that transaction fees are still going to be paid in plain bitcoins, not colored coins. This should in theory create at least a small increase in demand for the currency.
For now, the effect would probably be negligible, but that might change as the block rewards continues to be reduced over the coming years.
@_date: 2014-07-29 21:53:37
Yes, but in centralized mining pools the pool operator alone determines what goes into a block. The miners only look for nonces to make valid whatever block the pool operator wants to create.
Thus, a 51% pool operator could still use all that hashing power to perform double spend attacks. It appears that GHash.io has in fact [done this in the past](

Smart cards have been a thing for many years now and they are much cheaper than a Trezor, too. More recent models also support ECDSA.
It has been possible for a long time to use smart card-based SSL client authentication in just about any existing web browser (assuming you have the proper drivers and PKCS libraries installed, which can be a bit of a pain). You can even use card readers with secure PIN pads for extra security if your PKCS library supports it.

I doubt such a fork would mandate full 8MB blocks in that situation. If the minimum block size was 1MB, capacity estimate still would be off by a factor of 8, invalidating the argument.
