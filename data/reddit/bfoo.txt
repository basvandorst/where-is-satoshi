Me too. But you dont have to have BTC in Gox to lose money over the insolvency. The overall reaction to this mess at other exchanges is harsh. Fuck the volatility!

First, you have to invest in Gox to build a new reliable and resilient market place. Who would do that?

I hope, the hack is months old. Otherwise that means that MtGox shut down their service but did not shut down their backend (databases etc.), letting them rot without maintenance. That would be another security fuckup so great that makes me speechless (software engineer).

Which makes me thinking about the problems with the bank they had. It could be that they had the cold storage at the bank, that tried to cancel Gox' accounts. Maybe those accounts were frozen along with the deposit box with the cold storage due to an investigation and a gag order that prevented the Bank and Gox to speak about it.

That could also mean, that Bitstamp itself transfered the coins to a safe wallet.

Just dont use anything where you cannot get the source code. And if you can get the code, inspect it and compile it yourself.

Volatility is also a sign that the market is not that big. It takes just fewer players to move the market. Meanwhile, more and more businesses are investing in BTC trading. You have to look at the graph at a 10 year scale and you would see those spikes as testings.
I would not call it a bubble burst if a country like China forbids trading. I'd call it a "harsh technical reaction". Right now, you simply cannot trade BTC into CNY. But there are other (more stable) currencies available.

You can already see counter movements. I bought in.

Well, I would not lose much. Anyway, I look at those trades in 12 months again for tax reasons ;).

Even miners from China can trade their coins into a different currency through off-land payment processors. If those mining investments are so large, they will just carry the newly mined coins out of the country and invest in USD or EUR. And that is far better than to rely on CNY.
Yes, currently there is panic among those who cannot trade into other currencies that easily. And yes, if you just look on the last 6 month, it is a bubble. But China is not the only player.

Depends on the driver's opinion ;)

Internet-wise Australia is a bad option.
