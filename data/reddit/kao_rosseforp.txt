May have been a better idea to wait for a correction before buying. But no worries, just hodl until the 40k everyone keeps talking about

Excuse me, can I use your tray-table for the duration of this flight?

Blehh, please keep this terrorist out of crypto. Assange will only serve to hurt public perception of crypto.

Straw man fallacies can me true, in fact they more often than not are true. It just means that you were refuting an argument not made by the other party.

Actually Ethereum is working on multiple side-chain solutions

If you are indeed a hodler, there is literally zero reason for you to be storing those coins on an exchange. If you don't control your private key(s), you don't control your coins. Get yourself a wallet, and get in control.

Because thats how blockchain works...

They actually recently busted a few Russian nuclear scientists for [using a super-computer to mine Bitcoin](

~~Are you implying that in the year 2021 the world will have forgotten about the Internet and computers? Even in some crazy hypothetical scenario where the entire human race experiences some kind of apocalyptic catastrophe, I feel like we would still at least remember the Internet and computers. The only way that the Internet and Computers will be forgotten by 2021 is if all of humanity is dead.~~

Well that's a different issue than fees. And yes ACH transfers do tend to take a while on GDAX, can't argue there. If you want it to be fast, use Wire Transfer, but that's not fee-less on Coinbases end, and usually not fee-less on the bank's end.

Yeah, so the very corner of the graph is the ATH, and then the percentage represents how much the price fell compared to the ATH
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:47:07
That's really not the case. A dip from $10 to $1 affects your portfolio in **exactly the same way** as a dip from $10,000 to $1,000.
Edit since people like to argue semantics so much: **This assumes you invested $X in both scenarios**
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:16:40
Actually, [percentage wise]( this dip is pretty tame compared to other crashes/dips in BTC's history.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:32:31
Yeah I see people complain about the CB/GDAX fee's all the time, and literally all you have to do is set a limit order on GDAX and you get fee-less coins. Even if you're looking to do a market order, just set a limit order like one cent below the current order. Would've thought that would be common knowledge, but apparently it's not.

The X axis is the amount of days and the Y axis is the percentage of change. So at the very top left of the chart, you have BTC's starting price for that specific crash which is 0% change. Then as you move forward in days we get different prices, which represent different percentages of change, causing movement on the Y axis. Each colored line represents a different BTC crash. Using this chart, we can see that our current crash is actually quite tame compared to other crashes.
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:13:58
Well sure if you invested more, you lost more. But that has nothing to do with how much the price moved. A 10% change is a 10% change regardless of what scale we're at. That's just mathematics.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:53:13
Well... yes... But that's not the point I was trying to make. Even using market buys which incurs fees is impossible without your money being on GDAX. I'm not sure what you're trying to argue here, because I said nothing about ACH transfers.
