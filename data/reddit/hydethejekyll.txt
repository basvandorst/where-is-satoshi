During a crash one bitcoin is still worth one bitcoin. Alts trade at bitcoin price. So if one btc is worth 20k and one alt coin is worth .1 btc then that alt is worth in usd 2k. If btc goes to 10k then even if the alt is still worth .1 btc it will have a USD value of now 1k. The alt did not fall, btc fell. If the alt when up by 50% during this time .15 btc then it did not fall but the usd value would still be less at 1500 but your trade made a great return in Btc and when bitcoin goes back 20k you will have a 3k alt

If you absolutely HAVE to buy right now. Buy a small amount to get it out of your system. Like $50...max. I think we could see a $75-$150 coin. 
You have to think. Right now, most of the people that are not on margin right now bought in at around $10-50.... with another chunk that bought at $120. Everyone else is ~500 a coin and getting ready to call margins...

FIFO treatment is nonesence. The IRS did not say this, and it is a waste of money to pay all that extra taxes. 
The IRS Specifically said that it will be treated like a capital asset.




Only maybe if you are a business would you have to treat it FIFO. Miners however,  Have to claim the fair market value at the day they mine the coin... But for buying things you will only pay capital gains tax on the difference.

2.5w can only generate around 8 and a half BTU per hour, this is by no means pretty warm.
However 38 watts is more like 120. I just ran the math on the heatsink based off parts from digikey matching the specs. Atleast it all lines up correctly. 
I gave them a litte wiggle room but not much. The souce temerature is right in line with what we expect 50.5*c maintained by the heatsinks size and flow. what this means is that The amount of BTU generated will be cooled by the sink bringing the source temp to 50c.
Now, I'm not giving them any money, because I think there is absolutely zero incentive to deliver on time. Why send out things that have already been payed? Especially considering every unit goes though extensive testing - which mean mining coins with them for a few weeks.

Actually, they are right about you getting the keys to a bitcoin and not any actually thing and it a good thing not a bad one. That's what makes bitcoin not able counterfeit. You don't actually have anything to counterfeit! Think about it like you have a safety deposit box full of transaction records and the transactions happened as long list of all transactions in the news paper.
 Bitcoin exist as "transactions" which are represented with private keys. An address is a location that receives private keys and a wallet is a bunch of addresses and keys. I will try to explain by showing the inner working of the bitcoin transaction.
In this sample transaction you can see how it works very nicely( I will explain so look for notes)

See, the bitcoin only kind of exist when it is being moved, but its really only ever referenced, not actually moved. I guess the miners would be the ones actually moving the bitcoin transaction in a way as the confirm and then block the referenced transaction when they mine new blocks. But the actual bitcoin is the string of transactions within the blockchain it's self.
I hope it helps

* 1 Freeze.
Stop trading back and forth. Do not talk to your family until you get an Idea as to what your doing. There is nothing that has cause Bitcoin to "die" Price is falling because of crazy downward pressier from mining, Coinbase, Shorts, and people that are watching the savings get smaller ever minute(like you)and deciding to call the margin.
 
If you have taken mostly long positions, you should have some BTC. Stop trying to recover losses, stop trying to make money, stop doing everything that you are doing. Just sit back and chill out(easier to say then do, I know) 
* 2 Secure your assets
After you reaserch how to safely do this. start moving your BTC into your OWN wallet - with all the price dropping there is no telling what can happen behind closed doors. If the owner of an exchange suddenly decides the bitcoin ship is sinking, he WILL cheat/steal to maintain his lifestyle.
* 3 Look at yourself.
It will be hard for you to believe that what your doing is very similar to gambling, please trust me on this. Others in here are acting like you a flat out gambling addict, don't worried your not, you just think like one. You compounded bad decisions with more bad decisions. If you listen to some rock bottom sob stories you will see that the types of decisions made are very close and the end results are exactly the same. 
You are not to blame and you really can fix it all, but not tomorrow. 
The reason people have other people manage their funds is to stay sane. When your broker enters you in a position, it rides on him not you. He can lose your money, but at least you didn't pull the trigger. You tend to feel a lot less guilty if a bad call is made. This is important because Guilt is what caused you to keep making bad decisions. 
(side story)
My grandmother under advice from her broker cashed out $6MM 'worth' of stocks on margin in 2000... she ended up with $1.2MM. It sounds like a lot, but it really is not when you are 68 years old and expect to live off it for the rest of your life. If she had not cashed out she would have $28MM right now( I did the math). 
The only thing that keeps her OK with it is that she followed the captains orders.Her husband picked this broker and He said "you should cash it out" and she did. "She" did not come up with the idea or even the broker. Do you think she thought it wise to question a professional choosen by her late husband(who was vice president of a bank, not the branch) when she has been an old school housewife her whole life? No.
She did not money, ever. 
She did not ask the kids because her husband just died a year ago and she did not want people to start fighting over something like this.
(end side story)
* 4 Switch focus.
There are other ways to get into bitcoin. In your case, I think it is better to invest in a company then buy the coins. I personally don't know if bitcoin has to actually be worth a lot of money(more then a few thousand) to be used by everyone in the whole world. But the tech behind it has massive potential. Your bitcoins are still worth a lot more then $623 a pop in equity and carry to a small start up. You can leverage your assets to become a part of a growing industry. Not so much as a currency. I keep a few bitcoins to use, but do not "invest" in the currency side of things. 
You could even try launching your own startup or joining one as an angle investor/partner. It's easier then you think and high stress enough to keep life new and exciting. 
(side story)
About one year ago I started my own bitcoin technology company. Now, I have a team and we are getting close to launch :) Alot of investors we talk to are people that started in a very similar situation to you. Someone passed and they inherited the money and responsibility to make more money with it. 
If you go this way, I would recommend you not do it site unseen. If you find a startup to get involved in, spend some BTC on a plane ticket, **and get an up to date due diligence report from them!** You could start by going to some of the Bitcoin conventions and poking around.
 
The bitcoin world is pretty small and awesome, it will not be hard to find a project worth getting behind. 
Do you have any skills of your own? 
I can't speak for other start ups but with us, we have been more concerned on what someone can do other then just put some money on the table(unless its alot of money or good connections). If you have any skills at all it should be easy to find someone that wants to work with you. Most start-ups need small scale seed funding at some point and most bitcoin start-ups accept BTC :)
* 5 Profit
You can turn this around and come up on top. More importantly, you have a obligation to your family to try. You will have to make some changes in you behavioral patterns but it is far from to late to fix. It's time to do it a new way.
If you always done what you've always done, you'll always have what you always have. Right now, you have a mess.

He is confusing money with currency. BTC is not a money in and of its self. Currency, definitely meaning "a medium of exchange" Bitcoin certainty is.

At $300 a huge amount of people are negative. Most of the people that are still on the up have cheap Bitcoins. They have more that they are willing to sell then the other traders. I think this will make it drop down again maybe to $200. and if it gets there, old money sells and new money holds. The price will go down everyday but be somewhat stable. I think new software and infrastructure will be the thing that pulls it back up, way up. People have to bleed first

I don't think you need to pay on your gains unless you have been turning Bitcoin into money. One of the great things about bitcoin is that you don't have to do this shit yet! I only pay tax on the coins that I sold. The coins that are still coins are mine, and I don't care if they become worth 1,000,000! I wont pay tax on it unless I convert it or the IRS **say** I have to.
The goverments will not get to have their cake and it it too. If they want tax bitcoin then they are going to have to stop ignoring it and apply some regulations. Just as if you had a baseball card that you bought for $100 then it became Worth $1000 you would only have to pay tax if you sold it. The same applies to Bitcoin. 
If you want you can send some bitcoins to me as well. Although, just as that would be a choice not a requirement so would sending free money to the IRS.
Any coins you turned into cash should be treated as a capitol gain and tax payment should be sent. 
@_date: 2014-10-26 03:29:37
I read both. 
The problem is, I don't think you thought this all the way out. It sounds like you want to do this business yourself, but you just gave it legally for free to everyone on the internet because you hit a snag with the patent. Worse of all, if you did actually intend to remove yourself from the picture, you did so in such a manner leaving plenty of room for a company to patent the actually implementation of it.
Whats to stop anyone from patenting a software implementation sighting your work as public domain? 
The paste bin is really well written and thought out, But I feel it leaves to much room for outside innovation. It might over simplify the algorithms making it sound like a common place implementation. It just does not read like this is a new innovation utilizing crazy complicated magic internet money. It sounds like a task tracking and payment protocol for independent contractor shipping.
But more importantly
The problem with the way you are doing things is that they are being done backwards.
As a company that is actually executing on an idea, one would hold patents to maintain ones way of doing things and unsure that other competitors can not come out and start doing EXACTLY what they are doing in the same manner. You should have started building a business first, and not even worry so much about a patent. 99% of success is in the application not the details. 
The patent is for a first to market company to strengthen its position, not establish it. All the time you spend on this bullshit you could already have a team and VC behind an actual service. 
Don't worry so much about getting a patent, do you think it really matters if Kickstarter owns a patent on there shit? nope, they don't even have one. They in fact have been trolled by people that do own patents on the general concepts. 
Did it affect Kickstarter? nope.
Kickstarter wins, random dude that patented an idea he never even implimented, losses.Maybe he got a few grand... don't know
Notice Lift, Uber, CityShare and a bunch of other company's that all do the same basic thing... But, the way they do it, defines how profitable and successful the company is. This 'method'(bussiness method patent) is what you try to protect. 
Really, you have to be doing something and asserting market position by provide the service for you to use the patent as protection.... 
Contrary, If you patent something that you are unable or unwilling to execute, you are essential being a patent troll. The only possible thing you can do is sue people that actually learn how to implement 'your' idea...or hold back progress.
Since no body likes a patent troll,and we all know that ideas often happen spontaneously on opposite ends of the Planet, Judges usually are not willing to fill in the lines with these sorts of things. In other words, you really have to have the actual patent in hand to be able to do anything at all. Most of all it has to be quite comprehensive.
Simply put, What you have done, might be enough for a provisional patent , but I highly doubt a PA would recommend you to have gone that route anyway. 
But, what you have done is given it to the public domain, admirable, but not in your favor. This might prevent someone else from patenting the idea in the future, although it may equaling prevent you from being to patent you own idea...
However, it does not prevent anyone from actually starting and implementing this business model and patenting the specific technology and algorithms that enable it's success.It is now as you said, in the public domain. 
If you were intending to build this company and be the most critical part of it, maybe I could get you going in the right direction. I have my own startup that takes up most of my time, but I could possibly advise you and help get your feet off the ground. 
@_date: 2014-09-22 17:37:34
It's alot of different things causing more selling presser then buying. There is no way to tell exactly how much from any one source, but a few of the things that might be contributing now are as follows. As I said, hard to know exact figures. 
Miners sell bitcoin everyday, $2+MM worth of selling presser
Most companies that we *beg* to accept bitcoin only sell it for cash the moment they get it. I would say this is another couple $million a day.
There has been a lot of new tools that allow you to bet against bitcoin. This causes a lot of problems......
If I were to buy a few thousand bitcoin, it WILL drop the price. If I wait until the orders are right, I can drop it quite a bit. If I have a shit ton of shorts then they will pay out when the drop hits. If I buy less then I am shorting, I will earn more then I lose. This is a huge factor right now. This is why we need one decentralized exchange as opposed to many off blockchain ones like coinbase.
Before this, Chinese investors manipulated the news for similar results.

All the old school miners are way to careless with btc... Makes me very sad to see such opportunity wasted. 
Anyone that has thousands of bitcoins that they don't treat like "real money".
There are many great bitcoin startups looking to trade equity and profits for funding - like mine ;) 
Anyone with this much vested interest in Bitcoin, should also be investing in bitcoin startups to strengthen their assets. Think about it like this,
When you invest in a bitcoin company, you are also investing in your own bitcoins. If the company provides a service or product that will be used within the bitcoin atmosphere then that product or service is also adding value and or transactions to the network.
The companies you help to launch will not only pay back on your investment directly, they will also add value to Bitcoin as a whole. For those of you that have thousands of btc, the value these companies add in the form of high bitcoin price will mostly overshadow the profits generated by the actual investment - we are headed for the moon after all.
TL;DR Don't be afraid to become an angle or silent partner if you're a bitcoin millionaire and for god's sake quadruple check your transactions!

I would have them calculate how many people are going to use bitcoin over us, and how much will that hurt. 
I would then find out how much it would cost Paypal to keep them as customers...
I would also estimate how much I could I nickle current customers and still retain them.
Other questions:
How would utilizing Bitcoin effect our planed objectives.
Could we implement beneficial parts of Crypto currency and still retain current infrastructure.
If my end decision was to increase prices... It would only be because I had determined that Crypto currency was going to cause an inevitable loss of profits that no current/new implementations on our end could recover. The only way to maintain growth and success is to increase fee's in growing areas to recover losses from shrinking markets.
If you think about it... China cant really do anything with Bitcoin now. So as a Chinese company you are still going to want to accept Paypal. 
Now because I know there is no other realistic option, I juice China. Now they might get upset and new innovations might happen to create new problems...BAD
So, to make it better I don't have China pay it! I stick it to the other end....
You would think that People in the US would get pissed off at this fee being on there side... and they will. 
But since China does not have an incentive to innovate or change their veiw on Bitcoin, they will still only accept Paypal and Cashiers checks/transfers. 
Also remember, a huge amount of goods are sold on ebay(Paypal) from China to the US/everywhere, .
Now, you will still use Bitcoin for a whole bunch of shit but buying these things off ebay is not going to be one of them.
**This is all Assuming my understanding of the OP's interpretation of Paypal's new fees is correct and the senders of payment pay the fee's now.**

In the end most of the world does not even know about btcoin so they will call it what Blockchain and other Industry leaders will call it. We are a very small piece of what is yet to come, If everyone of us decided (and we wont because most of us like it) to use the old ฿ it would not make a lick of difference on the global front.

It might be to abstact for you to understand with all that "free thought" running around in your head.
"The community will naturally decide what they want to use, it will not be brought up or forced, it will just happen." is almost verbatim to everything the idiot type said at OWS.
I was there and people like you stopped the movement from going forward. You all complained about camping in a park and your "1st amendment right" to do so that you forgot the point of the whole thing.

FIFO treatment is nonesence. The IRS did not say this, and it is a waste of money to pay all that extra taxes.

If a taxpayer holds virtual currency as capital - like stocks or bonds or other investment property - gains or losses are realized as capital gains or losses, the agency said.

They are right about you getting the keys to a bitcoin, but it's a good thing not a bad one. That's what makes bitcoin not able counterfeit. You don't actually have something to counterfeit, its more lie you have inside knowledge about specific transactions the Blockchain.  
The Blockchain is a string of all the transactions. It's nice to think about it like you have a safety deposit box full of transaction records and the transactions happened as long list of all transactions in the news paper. These records give you the ability to request a new transaction to be fulfilled by miners. That's why they have to be confirmed by building them into a block and then chaining more blocks after it. 
 Bitcoin exist as "transactions" which are represented with private keys. An address is a location that receives transactions and a wallet is a bunch of addresses and keys. There is not even a sending address, only ones to receive. The last receiving address acts as a point to send a new transaction to a new receiving address.
I will try to explain by showing the inner working of the actual bitcoin transaction.
In this sample transaction you can see how it works very nicely( I will explain so look for notes)

See, the bitcoin only kind of exist when it is being moved, but its really only ever referenced, not actually moved. I guess the miners would be the ones actually moving the bitcoin transaction in a way as the confirm and then block the referenced transaction when they mine new blocks. But the actual bitcoin is the string of transactions within the blockchain it's self.
I hope it helps

If your writing a book, I get it. Take the flex option that way even if you don't meet your goal, the money will still be used to help with its creation.
If you are making a product that you KNOW how much it will cost to get going and you take flexible funding. It is because you want the money.
In the event this company only raises the 4k they already have... They are not getting any VC money, and they are not going to get anywhere with the 4 grand. Those people will just be out of there money until.... forever

It seems like they may have said to you that the bitcoins were to be used for buying stolen credit cards. While questionable ethically, this is not money laundering. I think you might *at most* be misprision of felony, which is a misdemeanor if you had never reported the crime.
U.S. Code § 1956
(1) Whoever, knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity, conducts or attempts to conduct such a financial transaction which in fact involves the proceeds of specified unlawful activity—
(i) with the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity; or
(ii) with intent to engage in conduct constituting a violation of section 7201 or 7206 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986; or
(B) knowing that the transaction is designed in whole or in part—
(i) to conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds of specified unlawful activity; or
(ii) to avoid a transaction reporting requirement under State or Federal law,
The only thing that remotely applies to what you did was meet in a hotel - which *might* look like section b(i)
**note to other traders of bitcoin** 
Meeting in an official location -one with legitimacy and cameras is not just for you personal safety. Selling Bitcoins to someone in a place like a bank will really help your case. It defiantly gives the impression that you believed this to be a completely non criminal transaction.
As far as the money service business without a license thing...Its bullshit all the way.
(1) Currency dealer or exchanger 
(2) Check casher 
(3) Issuer of traveler's checks, money orders or stored value 
(4) Seller or redeemer of traveler's checks, money orders or **stored value**. 
(5) Money transmitter.
(6) U.S. Postal Service.
Stored value is the only possible thing, and it is quite easily debated in your favor. I mean, if the prosecutions definition of a stored value includes personal property that can be traded for property or assets, then literally everyone in the courtroom would be or have been one at some point.
Not to mention the biggest downside to bitcoin has been publicly stated to be it's Volatility. Even Air Jordan's are less volatile than our btc. I would love to see that prosecutor try and pursue money transmitting or MSB on someone for selling 35 pairs of J's...

**Playing devils advocate** I want us to remember some fundamentals 
How much "money" would any of them own if not for the systems and networks that enable commerce.
It's like when all these super rich say they made it "all on their own". They give no credit to the College alumni, or the insignificant $20k they were loaned after school to start a business. Not for the roads they drive or the networks put in place before them. Without these things there would be nothing. Even our Bitcoin could not exist if all these other things were not done by other people.
You have to think, people that live in Ukraine are Ukrainian. Just as you or I are American. I would DIE for America, I would Rebuild it so my children can have better then me. When you think "their own money" I think about when my children say the same to me, "it's mine"...

You can buy shares of this company on havelock investments with bitcoin. Up until last night you could buy from lgb holdings (the holdings for neo &amp; bee) directly.
I bought some last night and am happy that I did. I look at it like this...
If something sounds like a good idea and you can get any type of equity without really putting yourself out..
Why not do it? 
When I first heard of bitcoin they were $.10 WTF. At the time I did not think to buy $20 worth, that concept (unfortunately) had to be learned by mistake...
Obviously, that would have been the best $20 I ever spent(shy of the first date with my wife).
So now I drop $20 on things that sound awesome but are "risky"  because, its **only 20 bucks!** That's literately the price of a drink at a nice bar...
tl:dr Next time you order pizza, invest what you would spend on bread sticks in a "risky" yet **great** sounding concept.

This was me, only I was the real idiot I found out about Btc back in early 2011. I told everyone I talked with about bitcoins. Told them how great it was, how it was going to help the world, and how much money they can get if they get involved now. Every person shot it down and thought me as an idiot for buying into this whole thing. I in turn eventually believed them to be right. 
After not convincing anyone that I knew (including family) that Btc was the thing to buy. I decided to not buy any myself and sit back and "watch" to see what happens...
What was this horrid show of regrets and self loathing that I had tuned in for! First my little $3 dollar fake internet money went on to $50 then $200! Me, this whole time, to busy hating my self to do anything along the way. I focused on my failure to believe in myself and continued counting my losses. Still not purchasing any Btc... Then, It happens again! $1200! wtf is the shit? I hardly slept for a week, during the day I often felt like throwing up. Literally sick, and disgusted by myself...
How could I be such an idiot? How could I be so passionate about something, but to scared to get involved. Then it hit me... I am doing it now, right now at near $1000 dollar a coin it is no different back then. I was so busy looking at how badly I let down my self and family that I could not see that it has ALWAYS been a good investment. If it goes to $5,000 tomorrow it will still be a great time to buy.
Whats done is done. I F up and broke the  rule that every person since we are born has told us to do... Beleive in ourselves. 
I decided that I have learned the hard way and I will not repeat. I am happy to say that I have made a bitcoin wallet, and an account at Coinbase! I am waiting for the bank verification part but it should be done soon. By next week I will be the proud owner of some mBtc, and I will be buying and using it as often as I can afford. 
On a great side note, I am going to believe in myself until the day I die! Not to mention the fact that I am still getting in early enough to ride Btc to $10k and beyond. This has been one of the greatest lessons that I will learn in my life and that is worth its weight in Bitcoin

I simply saying he should get involved with a bitcoin company and stop trying to trade. If they do not "need" this money in the next 2 years I would think it could get back up to +600. 
My grandmother had plenty of funds to weather the storm and its not like she bought in during the height of the bubble, most of the portfolio would have balanced over the next 2-3 years. Not to mention there are not any margin maintenance requirements in Bitcoin. No one is going to auto sell his BTC. In a few years, BTC will be back up to $628. New software could cause it to be much sooner. 
The technological innovation of the blockchain is going to be critical in future companies IBM is doing some pretty awesome stuff with it right now "as off blockchain transactions". I might not think that bitcoins will be worth $XMM in 20 years, But I still think that the amount of things that will connect to the blockchain will drive the price up to a few thousand. If he calls the margin now, and 3 years away BTC is worth $1300 then he will view this as a mistake. Big time.
He should not "cash out" and he should not keep "trading". He should take a multi-faceted approach to rebuilding and recovering from loss. Part of that may be calling some margins. But really, I think he should get behind a good tech company that is using the blockchain for some aspect of its infrastructure. 
I know a few people over at BitAngles and they are not rich. Bitangles seeds companies with $25,000 rounds. Several people will go through the DD and several people will be involved directly in the company's growth. Might They often have a low carry(6%) on investment but it should still be enough to recover from these losses in reasonable time.
ether way he should stop doing shit until he figures out some solid plans and talks it over with his family.

I would like to play Devils advocate....
Just to note a few things not noted, because I researched this guy out of concern
Brock was 19 in 1999.
This guy "Collins-Rector" seemed to be the epicenter. Brock was a nobody from Mightyducks that landed an awesome deal with DEN. I can image that Brock got hooked up with Collins-Rector when he was a minor and for what ever reason stuck around - I can assume a handsome lad like Brock knows first hand about getting molested by this Collins-Rector guy.
I'm only saying that Collins name was mentioned 62 times and Brocks was mentioned 72.
Lets break it down.
Section 25. - First time Brock's name comes up. 
Point: Brock used illegally download software at DEN...
Section 27. 
Point:Brian signer was just like Collins-Rector.
Section 37.
Point: Brock funded and had equity in a company that farmed gold in Warcraft. This goes on and on about it for almost a page.
Section 117. is about the FBI and Collins-Rector 
Point: Brock said that he was hanging out with Collins on that day by chance.
Section 128. Back to Singer. Again Brock was 19 at this time and was probably a victim as well nothing really said about Brock.
Someone has a personal problem with Brock and I think they might be trying to smear him. But I don't know, it's just a hunch. I think Brock was "willing" Molested by Collins-Rector when he was a kid and Collins-Rector. I think Brock then fell in love with Collins-Rector and became a boytoy - hell the person trying to smear could also be someones ex/current boytoy. It just all seem fishy to me.

I must have missed that... I thought he had been buying coins.
If he can get called at 250 then yeah, it's not even really a choice at this point. I can almost guarantee that we will see lower then $250 at some point over the next week. Hell, I'm thinking it *might* go down to $75-$150 because of buy in distribution.
I Fully agree that he needs to talk to his family about this(said in both post). I thought he should bring the idea of investing in a project to the table-I don't see many other ways to recover the loss other then something capital.  
But, after reading the that he does not even know his liquidation point...
 
You are right, He has a proven track record of making bad decisions.

Gold does not keep books. 
This is like saying "48% of Americans understand the internet but prefer newspapers" 
News is a thing that can be easily distributed Via the Internet. Much like Currency can greatly benefit by fast and secure bookkeeping...

lol, about to go to jail? Anyway, I would drop them in all forms so you can diversify. If your going to put say $20,000 in BTC I would put %50 to %75 in BIP38 Cold storage(maybe 10 different account) I would then place the rest in other methods like 5-10% in Coinbase because they could very well still be a major player in 20 years. Biggest problem is money(in any form) might not even exist in 20 years lol. Maybe tattoo the private keys on the inside of your ass crack or other weird place

Thank you for the oil and the compliment! and to answer your question, yes I was.

lololol. You make assumptions and write it as fact...
I thought you were real until the end 
"bitcoin is poison" That's why it has been growing so well?
"predominately backed by criminal activity" WTF? what about the 260MM put into Venture capital this year? all criminals huh

This is a scam site... It looks great but none of it is real, you have to make a real wallet on coinbase.com for you to get the satoshi. Thing is, this web site gets 5 bucks when you buy 100 worth of bitcoins from coin base.
 Why not refer your friend to coinbase and you get the $5. 
This site  explains it very well and much more in depth and is free to use.

The new one is much better. Bitcoin is bigger then just currency and making it have a cash like symbol is limiting. 
฿itcoin for currency and Ƀlockchain?  
I mean even looking at it there. Ƀitcoin looks so much more international and important.

a bitcoin can **only** exist as a transaction. Last time I said this I was downvoted...

I don't think it is that hard for someone to look at this as a capital asset. Unless you receive payment in form of BTC, then I would treat it as it's cash value at the time of payment.

Overall, This is not very good. Slightly good for the super long term hodlers. - This should mean you can put your cypto in a commodity fund parked inside a tax differed IRA.

thank you very much

Best advice, literally buy what you can afford to lose. Don't worry about the value when you buy, just buy a dispensable amount. Aim for $100 per month, you can even buy 5-10

I love when they start saying it's your fault they didn't invest. Somehow, these kinds of people need to have a scapegoat. I tell everyone I know the same thing. 1)buy a small amount every week regardless of price 2) don't sell them, you will eventually regret it. 3) buy chunks on the dips...

As an American, will my government give me a hard time if I go to Canada to get stoned? What if thousands of Americans got stoned in front of USBP on Canada's side, would they get in trouble when they enter the US?
