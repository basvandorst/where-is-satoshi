For Bitcoin?
Unless you have a time machine, you're losing money.

Asked my wife (who knows nothing of bitcoin) - "Is that like Paypal?  I'd just use my card." - I guess the point is that if you enable BTC without making it a big deal, most people won't notice or care.

You aren't accounting for the population decline after the Great Culling of 2021.

I think his point was that you are not accounting for the decline in BTC value.
Say you used that 0.116 to buy a gift card at gyft on June 29th.  Now use that same amount to buy a card today.
You'd have been better off doing exactly that.
Of course if the value of BTC would have gone up during that time - totally different story.

Sure. But they can't ban bitcoin. Prices will be what they will be.

Drugs are a physical good.  Their presence is provable without assistance from the holder.  You have it or you don't.
Bitcoin is not.  Yes, they can regulate the points where they are traded for fiat/goods/services - but they can't stop someone from updating the blockchain.  They can't measure creation or importing because it doesn't exist anywhere specific (or rather, it exists everywhere).
Their actions could influence the market value.  Maybe up, maybe down.  Maybe so far down that the market moves on to something else.

Upside: as miners go offline the difficultly plummets and the network becomes centered around GPU and home-mining rigs again.

I'm not really trying to get into a debate since I think we're in basic agreement.  All I'm saying is that it can't be banned. It's not physical like drugs. There is no "importing" it because it doesn't have a location. It's everywhere the blockchain is. 
Yes, the government can make it more (or less) difficult to trade btc for goods/services, and those actions will have market impacts, but the notion of banning it in a meaningful way can't happen (though it's possible they could make the usage of some other altcoin attractive enough to effectively kill btc).

Thankfully there is no "they" who can ban it.
