There are indeed some (generally older) people who will only queue up at their own bank's cash machine.

UK here, I can't think of a time where a transfer between banks hasn't been instant for years.
I mean, how do you think people use bitcoin in the first place to make a purchase from their bank? Via a transfer.

Confirmed, this thread makes no sense to me as a Brit.

Yeah I'm still talking about receiving the money. Every BTC order I've made has been via a bank transfer confirmed by the recipient when it hits. This takes about 20 minutes. Where are you buying BTC if not by instant(ish) bank transfer? Or do you just wait days for it?

How do you use a bitcoin in a shop? Do you have to sit around waiting for it to transfer like you do on websites?

MOST train stations?
The ones in major cities only, I thought...

But what do you do if you haven't got a secondlife account? it seems to mandate the use of an 'avatar' upon signup
