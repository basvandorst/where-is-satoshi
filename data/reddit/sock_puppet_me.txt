A hodler is someone just like us. Someone crazy enough to buy the highs and sell the lows.
A hodler knows this is how it is done. 'Twas ever thus.
Hodl on tight. To the moon. 
I am not a wise man. But I keep hodling.

I'm still noob but have enough of a clue at prompt to run a node.

Any advice from those savvy appreciated.
I am not the most technical person but the more I read, the more I see segwit as reasonable and BU as a power grab.
It seems anathema to all that interested me about it in the first place.

Guess that explains why your exchange tanks in every period of extreme volatility.
Oh wait, that's by design.

It only hurts cuz I put in a stop sell for the way down, but then couldn't buy back on the cheap cuz gdax went down for a fucking hour.

I'd never thought of the centralization aspect of ISPs carrying the majority of nodes.
Great piece.
