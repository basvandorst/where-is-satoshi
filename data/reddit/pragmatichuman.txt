Okay let's accept for a second your differing definition of currency and money. Although in a thread about GBP and Bitcoin, we are talking about currency and inflation. 
Bitcoin is no better as money as it is currency. Nobody in their right mind would store their wealth in something so volitile. For the same reasons it largely fails as a circulating currency. Those who do, save for early adopters, are just waiting to get out at a reasonable level. Having been attracted by deflation visa vie fiat currency, and commodity goods, but then burned by the speculative bubbles such a structure promotes. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 22:37:48
Could you expand on why I'm wrong, instead of just asserting it? Who knows, maybe we'll all learn a thing or two in the process. Always happy to entertain different views. 
@_date: 2018-09-08 22:33:45
For what purpose? Economies are driven by transactions. Have a deflationary currency, and no one wants to transact above the bare essentials. Given that it pays to hold the cash over time. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 00:25:47
Okay so from your last line, you're speaking from ideology. I'm only concerned with the practical realities. Which are historically well documented. There are good reasons the world broke away from the gold standard. 
I have no problem with experimenting with alternatives. I actively invest in cryptocurrencies, but I'd never consider them to be useful as actual currencies. Not in the form of Bitcoin.

The lack of stability of fiat currencies tends to owe to bad governance more than anything. The most stable, well governed states, have currencies that have endured for centuries. Inflation is not a marker of failure. 
It would be a bad thing because one person's spending is another's income, is anothers tax revenue, is another's infrastructure, and so on. The purpose of money is to circulate, greasing the wheels of exchange between people. Money that is horded is pretty useless. A deflationary currency encourages hording and speculation. The economic consequences of deflation are well know. The great depression, and the exiting of the gold standard by the major powers springs to mind. Even short periods of real world deflation cause serious economic pain. 
Crypto currencies are deflationary by nature, and they suffer from a lack from transactions relative to availability. Instead they're horded and traded as a store of value or for speculative purposes. Not saying this is bad, but if the goal is transactions and exchange between people - the purpose of a currency -  It isn't very useful.

So if this is your position, why post this at all? Seems like you're talking it up to me, by signalling you're buying (implying that others should too), since you were allegedly right about something.
 I'm sure this has nothing to do with your financial position though.
@_date: 2018-11-15 13:21:18
Not sure why I am being downvoted, it is so transparent. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 09:53:33
Is this a trick question?
@_date: 2019-01-16 13:06:43
I don't think you understand how the world works. Just projecting your politics onto things. 
 
@_date: 2019-01-16 13:53:03
That's not my point. Debt totals are meaningless. 
@_date: 2019-01-16 09:29:06
So another weirdo with a podcast starts using bitcoin. Colour me surprised. 
@_date: 2019-01-16 22:57:04
Debt servicing costs are a legitimate concern, as is the global interest rate environment, leverage ratios, and the market valuations of the assets/collateral classes being lent against. But this is a much more complex discussion. 
Total debt in nominal or absolute terms has no real meaning. Comparisons relative to global output or wealth are too crude to draw any real conclusions. 
Even measuring relative to historic highs can be misleading because one indicator of economic development is the financial sophistication of an economy. The more sophisticated an economy, the higher debt levels it can service and sustain without triggering problems. It sounds counter intuitive, but this is actually a good thing.

Surely the fees must be ruinous?

One man's debt is another's asset/income. Think about it.

Leftist commie companies. Right......

I think that it means absolutely nothing since its comparing apples with something that's not apple.

I think Tim Draper, given his substantial position, would be hard put to say anything else. His views are unavoidably distorted by self interest. 
@_date: 2018-07-20 12:06:59
It's simple, people don't trust what they don't understand. And almost nobody understands Bitcoin. But that's fine, because they don't need too. 
No one needs to understand how the global Visa or MasterCard networks work in order to use them. They just need to understand the very simple applications built on top of the technology to make payments, and how that benefits them. 
This is where bitcoin needs to head for mass adoption. It needs to be as easy to transact with bitcoin as it is with a debit card, but with the additional benefits of the underlying crypto ledger technology.

Looks proper scammy.

Gold and silver coins were still issued by  sovereign authorities. Those coins were still systematically debased in times of trouble by reducing their gold and silver content.

You haven't pointed out any flaws. Just asserted that I'm wrong. The opposing position is the fallacy that the past will repeat itself. The majority of HODL guys (at least here), are waiting for the second coming. Improbable. 
I would love for someone to make a robust argument as to why 2017 was just like the previous price bubbles. Perhaps explaining how they imagine a parabolic bubble, engaged  mainstream, fuelled by the mania of an inexperienced mass, can be surpassed. (Given all the constraints) When the weight of history is against such an assumption. And where there is not only a lack of 'macro' drivers for another speculative bubble of that magnitude, but the picture is one of numoruous sustained headwinds. 
It is true that previous speculative bubbles have happened in this space, but 2017 came at a time before all of the above was true. When Bitcoin bubbles were fuelled by hobbyist, the wind in its sails. Strong ideology, new paradigm set for world domination, hype, ignorant masses, no headwinds. Conditions have changed. 
@_date: 2019-05-14 08:21:54
This seems logical,but in reality if they didn't sell while it was falling out of fear of loss. They won't sell while it's gaining out of fear of future loss. (Missing out). The psychological goalposts will simply move with the price.
@_date: 2018-12-02 14:39:10
None of the previous bubbles touched beyond hobbyists. Dec 2017 reached critical mass, it became popular, then the bubble popped and burned everyone. There is no undoing what has been done. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 12:21:12
Your statement is contradictory. You say their task is to keep your money safe, but whine when they actually keep your money safe by taking such precautions. It is a necessary operational requirement for them. To stop fraud, manage risk, and comply with regulation. Regulations that are again necessarily strict because people demand there money be safe. Since banks are private concerns, they have some limited discretion as to how they operate under these conditions. 
Acknowledgment of how the world works is not the same thing as defence. No bank needs me to defend them.

What are your wild predictions based on?

Do you not live in a country with deposit protection?

You entered into a contract with them. If you don't like the terms, then don't play. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 09:40:17
That would be an extreme outlier scenario. You could just as well say it will be $50 a year from now. The truth will be somewhere in the middle. Probably at the lower end, given the historic bubble of late 2017. 
The general rule is such bubbles never recover their heights, let alone exceed them. See: South sea bubble; Japan; tech stocks etc. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 14:51:52
No. I implore you to keep buying.

That's a few days for Visa.

@_date: 2018-12-02 14:34:09
Except that previous bubbles were fundamentally different from that in 2017. And it's market cap should be related to its underlying value. Which has little to do with the size of other markets. (By some measures of value, Bitcoins network is still overvalued) 
@_date: 2018-12-02 12:32:59
Who wants to be paid in a medium that can give you a 40% pay cut in two weeks. That's like choosing between USD and Zimbabwe dollars.

Down vote all you like. It won't change the reality of things. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 15:08:55
It is not a mentality. It is a functional reality. 
Why else would you leave your money with an entity unless you trusted it with custody of said money. Hence the term trusted custodian. 
@_date: 2019-05-14 08:25:29
Not a bad idea. So long so you don't move the goalposts when the market turns down.
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:24:32
I have a decentralised bridge to sell you. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 15:13:44
What's wrong? Did you have your savings in Bitcoin too. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 14:49:28
That is ideological hyperbole. Bitcoin will always be niche. Just one of many applications. The technology will be deployed in a thousand different ways. Bitcoin itself is an inferior solution, not only to what else is available in this space, but what is available already for its major real world use cases like global remittance. 
What we have seen is speculative bubbles fuelled by unleashed greed. Not by growth in real value. What people here are wishing for is another speculative bubble of even greater magnitude. There are no driving forces sufficient to make that a reality now or in the foreseeable future. 
In fact, just the opposite. There are 4-5 significant headwinds. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 09:33:35
Good. The market needs a solid base of people like you. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 20:54:36

CHF is a safe haven, Bitcoin is like Pogs with leverage.

The whole cryptocurrency ecosystem is rife with fraud, hacking, ponzi schemes, and currency manipulation. I wouldn't be holding it up as an example just yet.
@_date: 2018-12-02 16:27:10
If that's true, then why would you argue about market cap and bubbles. Those things - don't matter to you. 
As for your bad news, I'm afraid you're projecting. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 15:04:07
Clearly you cannot do with it as you please. 
That stopped the moment you asked a trusted custodian to look after it for you.

@_date: 2018-12-02 09:29:04
Precisely, hostages to past bad decisions. Always the same. Then, try to turn this loss of control into some kind of virtue. As if greed and emotion had no input.
