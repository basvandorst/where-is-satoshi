Yeah, cause bitcoin would fix everything. 
Because it's not like the vast majority of bitcoins are held by tiny tiny fraction of the population, right?

Too bad reddit is owned by a REAL COMPANY that isn't going to intentionally reduce its revenue stream by taking your useless currency.

Bitcoin is a scam designed to make a lot of money for the early adopters and leave everyone else fucked.

LMAO yes, sure. People everywhere are going to adopt a currency that nobody earned and that doesn't represent ANY real value.
Bitcoin is a scam to enrich early adopters, that's it.

Yeah, it's the lack of hardware stopping bitcoin from being anything other than a scam to make early adopters rich. The hardware...

Aww, is somebody not making all those imaginary millions they expected?

Haha, we'll see.






Can someone explain how this isn't a complete contradiction?


It would be dangerous if there were any realistic probability of it ever being adopted anywhere outside of the fantasies of those who think they'll get rich off this shit.

I know why 'now may be a great time' - because now bitcoin is still a scam designed to enrich early adopters.

I hope you explained to them that it's just a big scam designed to enrich early adopters.
