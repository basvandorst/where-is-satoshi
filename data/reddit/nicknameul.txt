Just installed Armory on my offline laptop. I'll play with it for a while and, like you said when I'm comfortable, I'll use it for my savings.
Thank you for your help man

great job. keep up the good work

Agree. I was there today for a TechHub meeting and the people there are brilliant. Wanted to buy some BTC, but get this: they closed it in the basement over night... Tomorrow I'll be there again, maybe posting some pictures. There was talk about a press event tomorrow. Maybe that's why they took it to the basement, out of fear of a robbery before the press event :))) I'll keep you guys posted

I also installed Qreator from ubuntu software center. I was thinking the same thing to be honest. If I want to spend some BTC from my stash just generate a QR code of one of my Private keys and then use the remaining addresses for offline storage.
Thank you man

Thank you man

good read.
i don't like the overuse of the word "scheme". makes it look fishy...
But maybe it's just me
@_date: 2014-06-23 20:21:34

I think people don't want to sell because they know there are some people that lost the auction and are waiting for them to buy, increase the price, then drop it like it's hot
@_date: 2014-06-27 17:08:40
Same thing happend to me bro

audio is f** up sometimes, just so you know. so it's not your PC.
@_date: 2014-11-18 03:33:22
Yeah I'd like that 2
@_date: 2014-10-16 02:03:54
Come on man. Why would I do that? This is the meeting I was talking about: 
Don't worry it's not a virus :))
@_date: 2014-05-25 20:59:05
shit and i though i could be the lazy one. well i guess if it's worth doing, it's worth doing right. i'll be back with more info.
@_date: 2014-12-08 22:49:00
I was thinking about dice for a moment there because i already have the dice from my D'n'D adventures :))) but I'm not sure i'll be able to implement them correctly and maybe lose my funds... So, although i'm geeky enough to do it, i'll pass until I get more knowledge.
About the BIP38 passwords that is a big NO NO for me. I don't want to risk loosing my password or whatever and then loosing the funds as-well.
I'm thinking seriously about Armory. It was either the big story up OR Armory. I think in the end i'll go 50/50 and print everything, then delete the OS and install a new one... Paranoid as fuck I know, but better safe than sorry.
Thank you for your response
@_date: 2014-05-25 21:26:17
thank you man. 
I'll stay away from this kind of non-sense.... hope nobody sent their bitcoin to them. Peace
@_date: 2014-11-18 18:09:42

@_date: 2014-06-23 13:00:02

All i want is to connect to local blockchain and give some commands ( information about blocks, get account balances etc). was this a wrong approach? and if yes, could somebody give me an easier solution.
Last time i did some "programming" was done using C++ and it was in highschool... but i'm trying to at least get some minimal knowledge.
Hope you guys know more than me and are willing to help a brother out :D
EDIT: i know i can do this using the consule within bitcoin wallet, but i woud like to do a script where i input the pubkey address and it gives me the account balance.

simple as cake man. Don't buy from them again. Thank you for your warning on KnC.
@_date: 2014-06-18 10:41:57
The only question here is: What will the people do? 
With great power comes great responsibility and i think most of them enjoy todays enslavement...
@_date: 2014-06-23 20:31:30
don;t know why i didn;t think about this from start. just openned a new thread.
Thanks a lot
@_date: 2014-06-29 10:54:20
Cakkeeeee. I love cake. Is it your B-day? Or you just had some cake and are in a good mood?
@_date: 2014-05-25 19:20:24
That is what i was thinking to be honest. So there is no need to manually add them using .conf file.
Thanks a lot
@_date: 2014-11-06 01:50:46
Yep. Bitcoin ftw
@_date: 2014-07-04 02:04:08
