I am, and thanks again for the advice, but can you define "a while"?
Some places recommend two or three days

Thank you for your reply.
It would have a transaction if it worked the way i wanted it too ;P
In the end all i have to do is wait for the mempool to forget it, and wait for it to come back to my core wallet?

a friend of mine says stuff like this and stocks is the "Gentleman's Gamble" since it takes more thank a button press to make stuff happen
Edit: New to reddit... Why when i post a comment it automatically gives me 1 point?

A YTuber I'm currently watching suggests 500 USD to get started, and that's considered "small" investing.

Not quite, but might as well be.

I'd say big investments would start around 1k or higher

numbers 4 and 7 in your article are a re-occurring theme for me atm since I'm trying to get involved with the space, but I have to step back once in a while 'cause my brain keeps thinking "AHHHH I'M MISSING OUT ON DAH PROFITS!"
As much as i would like to invest... I can't really do that because i have a unique situation in which doesn't play along with the verification system well ;(
Just watching, and trying to learn as much as possible for now. Thanks for some information to help me along in this journey.

Would you happen to know a good beginner desktop wallet that can eventually have funds transferred to cold storage for windows 8?
