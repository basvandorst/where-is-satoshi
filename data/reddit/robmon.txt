OK, so instead of BitPay selling bitcoin on the open market they sell directly to private buyers?

Do large miners keep most of the bitcoin they mine or do they sell them quickly on the market after they are mined?
According to  KnC has a mining hashrate share of 5%, so they generate about 180 bitcoin per day. If they have no inventory of already mined bitcoin it would take them 222 days to deliver a contract for $10 000 000 to a single buyer at a locked price of $250. I guess KnC wouldn't want to lock in that amount of bitcoin for that price unless they could hedge it for future price spikes. Can they do that?
My guess is also that KnC already has buyers for all the bitcoin they are mining for the forseeable future.

So I guess they should resort to mining/creating coins themselves? Just like they're used to! :)

I love these small hints of great things to come, bitcoin is popping up in more and more places, all over the world. Surely there is no stopping us now? :)

This was my suspicion all along, a guy that got in too deep and couldn't keep his nose above water. Though it would be nice with a tiny update from him, like "Hey, I'm alive and trying to figure shit out".

The trezor guys can either be nice guys and compensate customers who have been waiting a long time, or be bad guys and don't give a flying fuck.
Fair compensation is money back or upgrade to metallic. I would gladly trade in the two plastic I ordered for one metallic if it is delivered to me in the next week.

Yes that is correct, Sweden is the rape capital of the world. On average people older than 62 years rape each other more than 3 times a day, more on the weekends. 
Acctually there is a swedish tobacco product called Rapé, for real! I guess rapé is a fancier kind of rape?

A well written article except the last paragraph, Tom just had to end it on a negative note (FUD) didn't he...

Something is fucked up, I have many orders that does not show on Market Depth at Bitcion Charts.

Good stuff, thanks for this!

Wow, just wow!
I feel the sudden urge to convert more of my fiat currency to Bitcoin!
@_date: 2012-04-14 09:57:19
Yes, this a very good article and the one I will be sending my friends to read to get what Bitcoin really is about!
@_date: 2012-09-27 11:46:33
This is bullish for Bitcion in the long run. Go Gavin!

Nice double negative, basicly everyone then believes in Bitcoin? :)

So I'm down in the basement, starting my computer, the next day I go back down and discovers I have a few Bitcoins that I can use to buy Kebab. Now THAT IS magic internet money to me!
Why is it so important for you to apply some strict fundamentalist view and shout "Heresy!" at me for trying to put words an a strong and positive feeling? Am I mocking the Creator?

Thanks for talking me down, I thought I was experiencing something amazing... Is it your full time job to make people feel a little less excited about Bitcoin?

1. Find Satoshi.
2. Remove its pants.
3. Swift hand motions.
4. Go swim!

First, don't ask random strangers on the Internet for financial advice.
Second, listen to me and do as I say, use half of your investment fund to buy at current rate and use the second half to buy in at the next dip.

Mullvad is great, you can even buy less than one day if you want. If you need only one hour VPN, divide the daily cost by 24, simple as that!
