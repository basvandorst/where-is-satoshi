Hey, I don't know a lot about the gov't messing with the US, but... you see me here, right?

Please donate some to erowid.org. They're a tremendous source of information about all kinds of psychoactive compounds, and doctors use it for helping overdose victims, as well as it helps educate the general public.
PS: For those worried, yes, some people may abuse the info available there. But I still think Erowid's done some great work for the community.
PPS: please, please, please consider donating to an LGBT charity. I don't really know which one yet (I'm not from the US or the EU/UK). Just be sure to pick a trustworthy organization, they'd need all the publicity and support we can give.
PPPS: damn, third edit! Others here have suggested MAPS.org and it completely flew over my head for some reason. Consider them too ^^

Learn what Shamir Secret Sharing is.
I keep 5 pieces of my recovery seed scattered around places, printed on paper, of which 3 is needed to recreate the seed.
Well, it's not the seed itself (because it's longer than what SSS can take), but just the password to decrypt the seed itself, which is symmetrically encrypted with GPG and printed on the same sheet of paper with each piece. Along with detailed instructions for recovery.
And there's the same information printed in QR codes next to the text, for convenience.
So if any 3 pieces of 5 survive and can be brought together, I can always open the envelopes and recreate my recovery seed. At the same time anyone who manages to get hold of less than 3 pieces, can't do anything with it.

Um... Depends who you ask. For geeks/IT people there are Habrahabr and Geektimes, but I don't know of any all encompassing social platform like Reddit...
People generally are 'happy' using the local Facebook clone which is... how do I say 'state-owned' without pissing off some big tech company again?

Or put his money where his nose is and start snorting it.
LOL. That mental image.

You can try splitting your seed using Shamir's Secret Sharing. This way, nobody having less than, say, 2 of 3 pieces, can reconstruct the seed.
If the piece of info you want to split is too large to fit into 1024 bits, just generate a secure 1024-bit key, encrypt your information symmetrically with it, and then split the key.
I used paper and QR codes.

So it just needs some more polish. Or just use NFC everywhere.

2009, news site. Too bad I never ever mined them from the start... obviously.

No, not USD. This little guy.

Just buy a hardware wallet. I use TREZOR, with seed split in 5 pieces using Shamir's secret sharing, with 3 pieces as a threshold needed to assemble it back.
2 pieces are hidden in plain sight in various places (think, QR codes on the wall) and 3 others are kept at more-or-less secure places I visit often.
