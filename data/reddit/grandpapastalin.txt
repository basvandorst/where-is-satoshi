But I don’t believe ������

If they discontinue the usd, then crypto would be long gone 
@_date: 2018-01-19 00:15:50
Awkward 
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:07:57
Why does being taxable matter ._.
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:55:16
Bitcoin isn’t up 17% tho? 
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:52:48
Don’t most people in the market hate bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:08:12
Traceable 
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:50:42
I dont think so pal 
@_date: 2018-01-19 00:42:14
As of 97% (guess) of people here, I don’t care about blocks chain, I just want money
If this isn’t stable like a normal currency, may as well own it 
@_date: 2018-01-19 00:41:07
This may be the dumbest thing I have seen
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:09:29
Wat in Tarntion 
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:32:03
How does crypto have lower fees than money 
@_date: 2018-01-19 00:54:42
But all of these companies are worth more than bitcoin, x2 more 
+most times when they crashed, it was from market crashes
Apple could just buy bitcoin outright if they wanted to 
All these companies also effect our lives daily, yet I have never seen any one use bitcoin before, and yet it is worth 200 billion? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:41:59
THIS IS A government  not a type of money that is only worth 300 billion 
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:56:24
Worth the ban coming 
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:33:12
When the stock collapses bitcoin will go down even more. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:08:53
Hahahahaa I live off the tears (but it is a commercial break during football, so what else am I supposed to do) 
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:57:06
But gold is limited bitcoins is not (or at least not as much) 
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:45:14
Because of governments 
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:39:28
Oh yeah
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:59:56
Doesn’t mining include the making of bitcoins though? In which that means it can be if infinite supply (honestly am confused) 
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:17:01
But in reality how likely is even a war in which (Let’s day America) would have to raise taxes etc. 
Also doesn’t the Usa make 560 million dollars per day
@_date: 2018-08-14 21:16:55
I meant that you shouldn’t need a Calculator to something to figure out how something (like a coffee) should cost in bitcoin, as I highly doubt many people can know it off the top of there heads even if the price didn’t fluctuate during the coffee transaction 
@_date: 2018-08-13 23:04:56
So your saying a (let’s face it) a concept, that so far has and is failing its main Goals in 2017 and now a days  should be worth hundreds of billions 
If you want decentralized currency this isn’t it and low change of  ever become decentralized 
If you want to be able to transfer money fast, this definitely isn’t it 
If you want or make this a real currency it shouldn’t  be .00004 btc or something for a cup of coffee bc then people would need like a calculator to find how much it would cost  and in that time the price could’ve gone done easily 1% which isn’t good for a currency 
The difference between 2013 and 2017 was that in 2013 is (early stated) that bitcoin wasn’t this huge thing worth 100 billion and in 2013 it was worth like 2 billion with very little people compared to today knowing about it 
Some of my family members are buying bitcoin not for “de centralization” or whatever y’all want but they own it hoping to make some easy money for retirement
@_date: 2018-08-13 23:08:46
I mean something going up hundreds of percent in just one year could raise some flags but people can be blinded by greed (and has happened to me a little more times than I would like to admit)
@_date: 2018-08-13 22:15:23
Strange thing is that bitcoin in 2017 was over priced by a mile 
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:21:46
How does that mean he sucks? Becoming the third richest man at one point is still very impressive 
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:55:10
If bitcoin is worth _____ about of money, then if money prices go down, won’t it bring bitcoin down with it 
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:29:54
Lived in it for the past 25 years 
@_date: 2018-02-21 22:15:21
If 1 bitcoin  = one 10k car now
If 1 bitcoin in 2100 is still worth 10,000 with no change, then 
1 bitcoin = .5 car it the price doubles 
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:37:16
You should have misspelled loser on purpose at the end 
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:05:33
One of the richest men in the world
Total looser 
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:25:54
Apple? 
@_date: 2018-02-21 02:57:34
But if let’s say bitcoin is worth 15, 000$ , and let’s say it stays that way. If a singlular dollar becomes  worth let’s say 50 cents, then won’t a bitcoin be worth only 7,500 $ instead of 15,000 $ 
@_date: 2018-02-21 12:15:28
If the price of a bitcoin stays the same, then it would still be 2 bitcoins 
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:39:16
But that little blip lost LOT more money that bitcoin down 60%
