That's sad because Estonia is known to be a country with high levels of IT adoption.

Chinese auto surfing software will kill this business model.

There is only one implementation of ripple that I know of and it includes an alt-coin. So what do you mean by using lightning as a trustless bridge in the ripple network if you don't mean the current ripple network? No one is going to create a new ripple network after lightning comes into existence when lightning offers better security because of the hash power backing the bitcoin blockchain.

So they'll provide verified ID. Just because you are using auto surfing software doesn't mean that you have no ID. Even hardcore criminals have ID.

Mexico is not going to pay for this. It's a ridiculous idea.

It's very rude to charge guests for the food that you serve them.

Sounds like ripple. Sounds very much like ripple. Did they recreate ripple on the bitcoin blockchain?

The private key is what you need to spend the bitcoins. With the address you can lookup the balance. In order to spend it download [electrum]( wallet, install it and run it to create a new wallet. Then use the [sweep private key function]( to move the coins to your new electrum wallet and in this manner get access to spend your bitcoins.

You can't fight technology. If something is more efficient then it will be adopted in the long run regardless of what governments or individuals do to try to stop it. Best thing they could to is to build the tools to regulate it as best they can.
This keeps happening over and over again in the history of the human race. Each time some new technology comes along that massively disrupts things entrenched interests try to fight it. And they couch their opposition to the tech in dogmatic terms. They will never come out and say that they oppose it because it hurts their self-interests. Regardless, they always fail in the long run because the bottom line is that if some technology makes labour more productive people *will* use it.
Oh and BTW all bitcoin transactions are public so LOL "at cannot be traced"! See for yourself:

They've stated quite strongly that they won't do that:

This has been mentioned before. A food truck stopped taking it after people kept asking them about it and wasted their time over it. 
Bitcoin evangelists should sell stuff on the streets for bitcoin not with the aim of making money but just to get the word out. To converse with people and correct their misconceptions.

no. no it doesn't.

They'll ignore the sign and still try to talk to him about it.

It's the sha256sum of whatever files you copy to the drive not just the first x number of bytes. 
Also there is some talk of "noise" so I think they do more than just a simple hash:


So they are adding some of their own entropy. Perhaps its hardcoded into the device. Is it unique for every device? Who knows!

you guys are really good. more power to you.

Bitcoin is also inflationary at the moment. Post halving it'll go down to 5-6%. But currently it's even higher than that.

Was bitcoin created in 08 or 09? I remember reading 09.
