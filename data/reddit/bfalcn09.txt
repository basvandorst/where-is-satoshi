Will be sooner than that, futures allows you to effectively short the premium in the same account. Buy futures and short GBTC, eventually the market pressure will force the premium to a much lower level.

I really don’t see how the IRS could expect people to realize a gain from a fork (unless they also sell the fork of course.) There have been almost a dozen forks this month alone, some with actual value trading on a few exchanges. Most people wouldn’t even be aware of them to report.

Cool game, but you need to add an option to use the stall.  Never use a urinal next to someone else.  Also, if your use of a urinal would force the next guy to break "the rules" in order to use a urinal (if he really had to go) then you should also error on the side of caution and use the stall, common courtesy.

I'm still not sure if he would actually hold that many coins anymore tbh.  Like anyone else it would be incredibly hard to resist selling the coins when they first hit $30 or $100 or $200.  I know if I had tens (hundreds?) of thousands of coins I would definitely have cashed out the majority of them well before the current price was hit.  It's only now that the currency is gaining mainstream attention/support that it seems truly viable on a large scale.
