Then there's me who wants both. Is that too much to ask? Is it wrong for me to make money on this? Why would you say there's only two exclusive types of people?

I'm here as a lurker. I can't afford to buy any bitcoins so I try to keep up with the news because I know bitcoin is the way of the future. I was able to mine a bit with my video card but I stopped because I can't replace it if that breaks. 
I can't wait to see bitcoin become mainstream and very widespread where its almost as normal as using dollars or euros. The only problem I see right now is how slow transaction confirmations take. If there's any way to fix that it would be a perfect currency.

Honestly, there should be a cryptocurrency foundation that's supported by all cryptocurrencies. Sort of like a United Nations type of thing but for all cryptocurrencies. At the same time, those cryptocurrencies can be officially endorsed by that foundations making the coin more... "official" giving the created coin some credibility. Of course there would be fees to be a member of this foundation to keep the foundation afloat.

It's a fairly simple question so I'm sure email won't be necessary but I did add it to my list of contacts just in case :) 
My question regarding methods was the types of payments you accept. I read above you will not be able to take paypal because of their policies. Are credit/ debit card payments acceptable?

A centralized location who's leaders are voted in via a democratic vote. I feel like initially, these things have to be self governed to get things going. After that initial stage could these votes and voting in general happen. That's my opinion on the matter.

Would it be possible to start a company that essentially "insures" people's bitcoin purchases? Think of the way insurance companies work except its for bitcoin. 
The problem I see with that is customers would have to provide some form of identification and that entire point of bitcoin is to be anonymous. Is it not?
I feel like the biggest problem with bitcoin is the fact that its anonymous. If there was a way to create a unique ID for wallets then most of these problems with theft would disappear. Then that would mean the entire concept of decentralization is gone...
My head hurts...

Thank you for the reply, I really appreciate it. I only have two questions actually. Firstly, I noticed someone mention specifically that VoS "kicks ass" as long as you're not from the US. Unforunately, I'm from the US - does this mean I cannot use VoS? If I can, I really liked the feedback so far and wanted to join. 
The second question, am I able to use credit/ debit cards at all? What types of payments are accepted. And also if you're not able to accept credit/ debit cards, may I ask why not?

How long does it take to receive funds from either buying or selling? I remember watching a video seeing it took a little over 24 hours to sell and I believe it was 2 - 3 hours to buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-06-17 16:20:27
Thanks for the tip! I hope this thread promotes meaningful discussion :)
@_date: 2014-01-07 18:42:24
This is exactly what's confusing me. I'm fairly certain I can figure out how to buy and sell altcoins on an exchange (which exchange would you recommend by the way?) But as far as actually storing them until I want to transfer them via buying or selling, how am I supposed to do it?
And if I want to move my coins from one wallet to another, how can I do that without transferring coins from one address to another?
@_date: 2014-07-20 15:20:05

It still would be nice to have an OFFICIAL plugin supported by the site. Right now, it feels sort of... Unofficial/ unprofessional... if that makes sense.

What is a paper wallet? I can look up a long term explanation later but a short definition for now would be nice :) And when speaking of back ups, do you mean encrypt the wallet and create multiple wallet.dat files? Wouldn't the coins eventually be "lost" for not being "updated" to the block chain over some time?
@_date: 2014-07-27 10:13:05
I updated it already which is why im confused. I want to change to a different wallet that lets me choose the fee I want to pay.
@_date: 2014-01-13 15:48:14
This thread only made me ask more questions than helped answer any. I always thought the altcoin QT wallet is the "official" wallet that should be used and always updated with the block chain. What other wallets can I use that doesn't always have to be updated? How do I safely store altcoins in general? I keep my altcoins in a wallet that is constantly updated on the blockchain. How do I transfer funds from one wallet to another without having to deal with a transaction fee? What's so important about generating different addresses and why can't I just use one or two? Encrypting the wallet means the wallet.dat file is encrypted, right? And finally, can I simply take this wallet.dat file and use it on any wallet whenever I need to access the funds?
@_date: 2014-02-04 17:44:00

@_date: 2014-06-17 16:09:19
My thoughts? I strongly believe bitcoin or a successor of bitcoin will be the future of currency as a whole. Let's take a step back and examine history. Look at how "money" and "currency" progressed throughout history. This is simply the next step in natural progression.
All these altcoins/ bitcoin derivatives are necessary for the ultimate success of crypto/ digital currency. We keep innovating and producing new technologies and we'll eventually end up with something phenomenal. We are ALL early adopters and this is still the beginning of progression. 
Everything we do is still very technical and it will become mainstream and treated like a currency when it gets much less technical and easy to use/ setup.
As for Litecoin, technology wise it was huge. It created a bitcoin derivative that was almost like Bitcoin in every aspect. The problem is technology advances and I personally feel Bitcoin and Litecoin will end up holding back innovation in some ways.
As of this moment, bitcoin and litecoin in my opinion can be considered the main cryptocurrencies and everything else falls under these two.

Can I suggest looking into Reddcoin as well?
EDIT: I went down a slight bit and saw it's only based on Moolah. So if Moolah accepts Reddcoin would you consider integrating?

Damn, I'm still looking forward to signing up but in the meantime would you have any recommendations for other exchanges? I understand if you can't advise me here. I'll definitely keep a lookout for the US branch.

Whether or not this is BS is not of your concern. Why? He's not asking for money, donations, etc. He merely wants information. He doesn't need to verify his identity with this post and you're more than welcome to help him or ignore him. On the other hand if he was asking for financial contributions then I agree with you 100%.

@_date: 2014-04-29 19:13:56
I'm glad you made this post. A Reddcoin dev, created the PoSV algorithm and I remember when reading a portion of his paper that this algorithm will give people incentive to run full nodes among other things. I am going to give this a chance as soon as the new wallet is released but it's always good to know how much bandwidth is being consumed when running these things. I may have to find a new location to host the wallet if I plan on running one in the long term. I'm fairly certain 13.77 GB or more will not be consumed when running a node for that cryptocurrency but more factors come into play. The amount of people using Reddcoin as well as current running nodes. If I decide to run a node it may very well end up chewing on my bandwidth.
Regardless, thanks for the information.

If it continues to grow the way it is right now via adoption as well as becoming extremely simple to use in the future, I can totally see Bitcoin's price being predicted somewhat. I should also add that I don't see this happening anytime soon, I'm thinking 10 - 20 years down the road.

That was pretty fucking hilarious and awesome. I hope you do more of these.
@_date: 2014-05-11 09:49:07
It doesn't matter what bitcoin is or isn't. What matters is the fact this is a fight against cryptocurrencies as a whole. Rather than specifying and isolating bitcoin and all the altcoins, everyone should be banding together and fight. Divide and conquer is how you win wars. If you want the big corporations to win, you can continue to think like this. If you want bitcoin to be part of our futures then I suggest you change your mentality to include all the major altcoins.
@_date: 2014-01-07 18:51:57
No problem at all, I just wanted to understand at the least what I will be getting into. And again, the backups are relatively straight forward I'm sure. Just press that darned button up there and save the file somewhere. I still don't understand if coins get lost over time for not being used. That's the perception I had after doing some reading. If coins do not get synced to the blockchain after some time they will be lost since they're old enough to not get "read" correctly or something. Is this true at all?
@_date: 2014-10-09 22:55:37
Im really sorry but this made me laugh really hard. I'm sure right now people cannot predict the market but I'm sure as time proceeds those people will crack that code and fully understand how the market works.

Serious question, I remember seeing a chart someone made about 2 - 3 weeks ago depicting the fact that Bitcoin is following the general trend where at this point in time Bitcoin should be drastically falling in price followed by a very hefty price increase.
Is it just me or is the price increasing much earlier than it was predicted? I thought the price was going to continue crashing well into the $200 level. Instead, the price picked up and I'm left even more confused than before.
@_date: 2014-03-21 14:55:08


Buyer Beware. I like you :) You say you have more trust in them than any other exchange, does that mean you went for level 2/ 3 verification?
@_date: 2014-05-28 06:30:02
The one thing that's really annoying me right now is why everyone feels it's necessary to be rude and disrespectful. People asked for proof and he provided some proof. As I scroll down I see lots of name calling and lots of people saying this method of funding is disgusting. How the heck is it disgusting? If anything, this is ingenious and unique. 
I never seen this type of funding happen before and I'm very interested to see how it works out. Filtering out all the non sense and negative comments, I do see a few things that work be really nice if they could get answered - sort of like checking off a to do list. I would also like to mention that I do not have extensive knowledge about how funding for these things work and I guarantee you a majority of these people commenting here don't know either (since there's no proof they are who they say they are).
First, you need to make sure this is allowed by your department. For the love of god or whatever you believe in make sure this does not violate any contracts or anything else. Please ask and don't hide anything from anyone that needs to know. 
Second, I would love to see a moderator of this subreddit approve this post in the first place. I understand you followed the rules but normally if you're going to ask for money from people, you need to be pre-approved by a mod. 
With that in mind, number three is an extension on two. If a moderator approves this - it means all necessary proof was fulfilled. None of us here are mods so any proof we ask for is probably not enough to be officially approved. It seems like the funding you're asking for is for the site, not for any specific research you're doing. It is not clear what the funding is for.
To quickly summarize and add one more suggestion, I strongly believe you should **DELETE** this thread then ask mods if you may ask for funding on this subreddit. You also need to come up with a better explanation of who you are, what you've done, what the funding is for, post any extra information people might need, AND post proof of everything.

@_date: 2014-06-27 18:04:58
I would also like to take this moment and raise some concern over the hostility that exists in general. I've seen these people ask questions all the time but there's so many people who pretty much tell them to "fuck off" or "google it". 
Also many people enjoy being vicious to people asking for donations. If it's done incorrectly then tell the OP respectfully how they can have their thread approved and attack them in every possible way. If they're scamming, warn people not to send coins and report the post. 
Hostility is not the best way to approach a situation. If you want people to accept Bitcoin as a mainstream coin then show that we are friendly and easy to work with. Bad publicity will negatively affect people's thoughts and judgments. After all, you do want your investment to grow in value, right? Do your part and promote positive behaviors and actions.
