Did you think we were going to stop the world's biggest online payment processor from integrating the world's biggest decentralised currency?

Oh yeah? Is Apple Pay a decentralised network that distributed trust and stake equally across participants?
Apple Pay is part of the legacy already. It's an innovative payment system that still belongs the old generation.

Not at all. Paypal has seen the light. Hypocrisy would be to keep criticising Paypal when they are doing the right thing.

He is a realist and is pushing for what will happen inevitably: governments and crypto economies fusing together. His way to do it is just a faster way to get there, even if some people seem to misunderstand him as a "statist" or whatever.

Which part of 


do you not understand?
Because it has been posted elsewhere on the Internet, it's OK to ignore the rules here?
Were you here when the Dorian fiasco came down? Do we want a repeat?

Hey mate, didn't mean to sound so harsh but yeah, there's a good reason why this kind of information is not good to be spread around like that. Media hysteria, etc...

Fair competitive games (Poker) and sports or events betting are alright, but crap like dice games, roulette, etc... need to be nuked from orbit. Never feel bad about telling the casino beggars to fuck off.

No, it is not turing complete, nor that is its aim.
Yes, it is innovative, you may want to look into their BitUSD mechanism and equity management.
Get out of your stereotypical perspective.

It will replace paypal and fiat the same way the Internet replaced television, radio, and the telephone. I.e it will not "replace" anything, it will be added on top of it. It will crush some of the stuff underneath but it's a brick, not a bomb.
@_date: 2014-09-16 13:13:58
But you would trust a currency called Bitcoin. Gotcha.

Standards don't work the same in the digital world, different solutions can coexist on devices without a problem.

And adoption by Paypal is a huge step in that direction. Feeling choosy about this is missing the whole point.

If I had been him, I would have nuked my old accounts from orbit, but maybe he wanted to keep a record without having to personally backup and store the data of all his posts.

They are doing the right thing. We can only congratulate them for that. They have seen the light. What are we supposed to do?
@_date: 2014-09-08 19:45:10
This is the sort of news that the industry has been talking about for years.
ALL HANDS ON DECK!

Ahem...
