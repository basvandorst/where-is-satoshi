I'm sorry, wasn't aware of that.

A recent study on the energy consumption of Bitcoin transactions revealed that the digital currency may consume as much electricity as Denmark by 2020.
Analysts are calling the cryptocurrency’s current consumption of energy unsustainable and suggesting that if the currency is to survive, it will have to adopt new energy-efficient technology.
Researcher Sebastiaan Deetman came to the conclusion that at bitcoin’s current level of expansion, it will require 14 gigawatts of electricity to run by the year 2020 — an amount of energy equivalent to that of a small country, like Denmark. At the current time, a single bitcoin transaction requires as much electricity consumption as the daily consumption of approximately 1.6 American households.
Bitcoin, which is transacted through a series of decentralized network connections, is currently consuming approximately 350 megawatts throughout the global netowrk — the equivalent of 280,000 American households. The increasing concern about energy consumption is forcing cryptocurrency advocates to reconsider Bitcoin’s internal structures.
Projects seeking to address concerns with Bitcoin’s energy consumption have begun to emerge, many of which have established proposals that could drastically decrease the amount of consumption. Deetman forecasts that an implementation of the proposals to fix the transaction ledger could lead to a Bitcoin network in 2020 that only consumes 417 megawatts, or 3% of the his original pessimistic prediction.
However, even in this optimistic scenario, the mining of one bitcoin in 2020 would still require a significant 5,500 kWh, or half the annual consumption of a single American household. If Bitcoin usage continues to grow at its current rate, the worldwide Bitcoin network by the end of 2016 would require more energy consumption than is currently generated globally.
The success of digital currency has always been predicated upon the ability of its designers and advocates to appropriately evolve and adapt. Although current forecasts suggest that change is necessary, Bitcoin’s foundation on progressive experimentation suggests that the cryptocurrency will live on to see it’s next chapter.

Fuck politics. We don't even need to vote for any of the corrupted politicians.
We can use voting systems in a lot of other places than in politics!

I have been wondering the same thing the last couple of weeks, since my LastPass Premium ran out.
So I wrote to them.

Thank you very much for your answer. 
As a non-native English speaker, I had to read i through some times in order to understand it.
I will definitely follow your party here from Denmark :-)
Wish you guys the best!

As far as I understand, it is a a lot like LiquidFeedback right? (The voting system from the Pirate Party in Germany)
If so, what's the main differences between what you guys are doing, and then LiquidFeedback, besides relying on the blockchain technology? :-)
Thank you in advance.

21 co + Uber + Self driving car? Sounds like the autonomous self driving car to me. Damn, this will become very interesting.

Wasn't it a year? And the opposition could do the same thing as well - and you would except the opposition to be of a much larger quantity.

LOL, it seems like that what they know about bitcoin/blockchain originates from a 3-4 year old article.

Hmmm - Changetip - It could be a way to force-tip charities that doesn't accept bitcoins yet? Just send it to their facebook/twitter/YouTube page?
