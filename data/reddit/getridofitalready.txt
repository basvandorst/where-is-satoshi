Lol 1) Yes you can fake bitcoin. I would be more likely duped by fake bitcoin than fake dollars, as would the average American. "Oh this site looks secure and legitimate". 2) Americans would have been better off putting their dollars into Bitcoin this past week, but that doesn't make Bitcoin a good store of value. Beating a particular currency over a short period of time =/= being a good store of value. 3) He didn't say BTC was bad, just that it's not replacing the dollar or bringing down capitalist structures like some appear to believe.
