Then can you explain it to us in more explicit words, please ?

Because being chinese gives you access to other facts and a higher level of truth ? Care to share some of it ?

So basically inflation leads to consumerism and wasting of resources.
Maybe what the world (the Earth) needs now is a little less of that (you know, because global warming, declining biodiversity and stuff...)

The post quoted by OP seems to be fake.

Yeah, the oceans are not rising too much yet, so there's no reason to worry about global warming. We will start to worry when massive floods begin.

Where did you get that information ? Huobi just said otherwise : they contacted their banks, who replied that they have no information about this 15th april thing. See

What I personally do : I own about 30 btc, and I let them sit on Kraken. I keep them there for several reasons : 
- I dont trust myself to keep a paper wallet safe for a long time.
- I mostly trust Kraken, in particular because they have automated audits.
- I want to be ready to sell quickly in case of a huge crash.

Is there a way to know the number of times the survey was answered ?
@_date: 2014-04-02 01:10:11
I think this post should be upvoted, because I'm pretty sure many people are genuinely wondering the same, and share some of OP's misconceptions. So it's important to educate them (as several of you did nicely).

What is the probability that despite the lack of official communication, PBOC will still force banks to stop dealing with exchanges in 12 days ?
Did PBOC ever abruptly enforce new rulings of that kind without notice in the past ? (even on non-bitcoin related matters ?)
@_date: 2014-03-31 13:20:17
No, it's not an official account. BTC China would not make official announcements on a forum, they would make them on their website or weibo.

This document is incorrect about many aspects. For example, it says that one major limitation of Bitcoin is it doesn't scale. Which is wrong (see :

NO. The word bit already has a meaning.
