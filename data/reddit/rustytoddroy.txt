It's funny bc SS doesn't even work that way. You don't "earn" it like you "earn" retirement by putting money into an IRA

That was actually good for bitcoin

Doesn't matter. It's the volatility in between that's scaring people. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:43:20
im pretty sure thats the reason people are panicking, easy come easy go

In that case it still costs the same though, the cost is just socialized.

That's kinda how I feel. I can only speak for my experience as a civil engineer, but I paid a ton of money for the ability to be able to build bridges and stuff. Like you can argue I could have taught myself and not paid people to teach me (like ancient Roman engineers built stuff and probably not all shelled out for equivalently expensive education), but I would put a very high value on the skills I've learned in school.
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:57:53
I don't know much about med school but given what doctors are capable of, some of which at least I assume they learned in med school, no. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:16:19
I think so. Even if the money were insignificant it still helped him get some extra exposure. I'm sure there were people who didn't know who he was until he appeared on the show.

I don't endorse TBBT but if you paid me money to appear in an episode I'd sure as hell do it

The greater than sign. Reddit turns it into a quote if you don't break it with a back slash. 
@_date: 2017-02-25 03:19:17
so does this mean if I did not log in to one of the affected sites during this time period there's a smaller chance of me being fucked than if I had?
@_date: 2017-03-18 18:13:13


You don't lose (or gain) money until you sell is how I look at it. Because that's how it is.
@_date: 2017-03-18 19:26:12
if you can afford to lose more then don't loose more on the market

yeah there's no wifi in there, what else am I gonna do?
@_date: 2017-03-18 19:25:05
does more coffee have a greater effect? for me it's more like the first couple sips does it and then any more doesn't matter. I don't have an espresso machine but if I did I bet that would be an efficient way to kickstart my day.
@_date: 2017-03-04 01:48:14
Not really tbh. We get slammed with snow every so often but other than that our winters are pretty mild, at least imo (of course it's all relative, someone in TX would probably think it's freezing). The guys up north have it way worse.
It was like 22C here earlier this week and we had a thunderstorm. 37C, despite blowing previous records out of the water, wouldn't surprised me *too* much,
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:09:39

Pssh, look at this guy over here, having blood. Not all of us can be so privileged.
@_date: 2017-03-18 18:05:44
you don't get paid in bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:52:28
I mean ETH was something like $10 earlier this year, then skyrocketed up 4000%. I know months is a long time scale in crypto but still that's an insane amount of money people have made just recently.
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:55:22
I'd say knowing about its existence is common, but how many know what it actually is or how to use it?

So in the theme here with not confusing new users:
I'm not new, been paying attention for about 1.5 years, but I've always uses exchanges (circle previously and now gemini). Is there an ELI5 guide on localbitcoins anywhere? 
@_date: 2017-05-02 20:54:35
@_date: 2017-05-05 00:52:50
Yeah I can't understand people with that "I won't do X unless I'm economically forced to to avoid [starving to death]" attitude. Like dude do you really not enjoy doing anything at all? If I didn't have to work to earn a living it's not like I'd drink fruity drinks on a beach and never move for the rest of my life, while my will to live slowly drains because I refuse to do anything that makes me happy. I don't even like doing that now. It would just mean I could pick any career/hobby/literally-anything-ever without money influencing that choice.
I feel like those people imagine the alternative to be living the 4chan NEET life lol
@_date: 2017-05-02 13:59:42
It's already realistic to buy a van (provided you find someone accepting btc), which can be a tiny living space. Just that's enough to get me excited.

When will we reach 42069?
@_date: 2017-05-02 22:07:55
I guess a satoshi if you had to make a direct equivalence, as it's the smallest unit. Gas stations can charge 9/10ths of a penny but it just gets rounded to a penny after the multiplication.
For example I looked up the USD-EUR exchange rate right now and €1 = $1.09. But no one interprets that as meaning that a euro is not able to be divided any smaller, it's just a ratio. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 17:26:12
TO THE MOOOOOON
@_date: 2017-05-15 13:40:35
I know plenty of &lt;30 people who call themselves and others kids. I mean in this case it's "haha dumb hacker foiled by neckbeard" so yeah it's passive aggression, but if you yourself are &lt;30 then that's pretty normal terminology ime. 
I really don't think there's any psychoanalysis to be done on why, it's just like "dude" but for a certain age group.

I got in Jan16 and iirc it was somewhere around 375. I wish I hadn't sold so much at 750. Now I'm a hodler. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 03:57:23
Now That's What I Call Hodling
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:28:28
Or maybe still not lol
For real though I've been in bitcoin long enough that this doesn't worry me much. I kinda wish I sold at the peak and rebought now but doesn't everyone. At least I was expecting this enough to not buy &gt;2k during this last bull run so I didn't really get hurt by this so far. 
I'll be without Internet for MONTHS later this year which will be far more interesting
@_date: 2017-05-26 03:52:50
So that's how subtraction works.

No? If everyone had sell orders at 1000000 that doesn't mean much if there's no buy orders.
@_date: 2017-05-02 20:53:54
I agree but don't really understand why. It's not like pennies don't exist.
@_date: 2017-05-05 04:11:18
This is not how anything works.

Yeah man we can't all be fat cats with money to buy houses and stuff
