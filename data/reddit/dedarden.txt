I'm not sure why they charged back, I didn't realize until my account got blocked on coinbase. I emailed coinbase and they are reviewing my account, it's been 3 days and no reply so far

Why would I have triggered money laundering? All my money is accounted for, I haven't put any money into the account that would be suspicious.

I will be after this, but I'm afraid to purchase anymore bitcoins now just incase I get blocked again on a different bank. Totally unbelievable, if they had a problem with transaction why ask me to try again?

I was just looking on their website, so they would accept cryptopay exchange? I really want too keep using them as it was instant transaction and very helpful live chat. Highly recommended

I've anonymously asked barclays do they accept bitcoin purchases and my reply was yes. So I'm at a total loss of why my account is blocked with no reason. I never purchased massive amounts or even withdrawn suspicions money. All I done was try another exchange and it's caused all of this. Crazy!

I do, but I have wages paid into there and now I'm unable to access them, the bank don't even know if the transaction will go through. It's one big mess that's clearly their fault but I'm being punished for.

I just realised I made a huge mistake when I had to first ring the fraud team after checking my card I put on my desk... I gave the wrong card number as I found the old card few days back and I accidently picked up the wrong one that I placed on the desk with my newest card. Would that have triggered an investigation into my account? I paid my internet bill at the same time as I bought bitcoins and the payment to ISP was successful, also the bitcoin company still said the payment was successful. What I can't understand is I was asked to visit the branch with ID and proof of address.
so note to self: Always discard of old bank cards immediately if you eventually find them.
Also, I visited the branch again to explain what I did wrong and it has been noted down on the system. But she told me it will still take a total of 10 days for a decision to be made and I won't be able to access the account for them 10 working days.

I've always had insecurities with banks, but we need them to live. Constantly having to ring fraud team to confirm payments, even companies I've used before. 
I feel like I got lured into them blocking my account, their systems are always down or failing and people end up in difficult situations because of it.

At most I've purchased £300 worth of bitcoin. I have never withdrawn bitcoin back into fiat money. The purchase I made was £70 and also paid a bill of £43. So total £113. The woman at the bank said it's showing £123 but doesn't say if its going out or in. The number she was told to ring would not give any information as to why the block was triggered.. the bitcoins have been sent to a few addresses but how would they know who owns what address? A few are friends of mine who I lent money too as I don't have paypal after an issue with them and sony ps4 purchases in the past.
