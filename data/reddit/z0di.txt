Have fun with that.
Honestly, I wish you good luck. 
But in my view, it's a ponzi scheme. You're free to believe that it's going to succeed the way you hope it will, but I simply see it as a valueless stock in the idea of getting rich quick (or losing everything). 
It's basically unregulated stock.

Yes, but that's not unique to bitcoin.

Absolutely fucking nothing. And that's why you should stay away from it. Especially now.

@_date: 2017-12-15 03:17:31
I read up on it in 2012. I'm not going to invest in something that has absolutely nothing to go off of besides public opinion. (in terms of value). If you feel safe investing in bitcoin, go for it. I'm going to laugh at everyone when it crashes though. I really hope you're not one of them.
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:47:54
You can only miss out if you feel you should've invested.
I don't like cryptocurrencies. I think they're just a gimmick, and the only people investing in them right now are people like you; people who spend all day on the internet reading stories about crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:34:24
This happened literally a fucking week ago dude.
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:52:28
You know you're trusting in loyalty to a valueless digital currency, right?
I just want to make sure you know what you're getting into.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:16:22
It's never going to be a solid investment, dude. 
You're placing way too much value in something that has no value. The only reason you value it is because other people value it, which makes you think "oh shit, this thing is valuable! I can make money if I give it money!"
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:06:14
That's nice, I hope you're okay with paying massive fees through the exchanges.

You're calling him cultish, but that's exactly what you're being right now. Cultish about stocks. Which is what bitcoin is essentially; unregulated stock. How does it increase in value? By others being invested in it. How does it lose value? People pulling out.
It's going to be manipulated over and over until it's regulated.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:19:59
If you really think that's a good idea, go for it. I'm just saying I am avoiding cryptocurrencies because I see them for what they are.
I'm not going to lose everything I have because some stupid fucks on the internet say "but you don't get it, this is the future!". I've done my research, I know an economic bubble when I see one. I know a pyramid scheme/ponzi scheme when I see one. 
I'm not going to convince you to stay away from it, but I can sure as shit laugh at the people who act like it's the greatest thing since sliced bread. These people are fools in my opinion. They are the ones who are going to lose the most, as they value it the highest. The people who value it the least are the ones who are smart enough to pull out before the bubble bursts. They are the ones who aren't going to trust in the currency; and as such, they'll minimize their losses.
Also, it's really sad that you think banks are bad because they are backed up by the FDIC. You need to understand that you *want* your currency backed up by something. Otherwise it's completely worthless.
@_date: 2017-12-15 09:30:55
People who agree? People who know its a bubble?
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:49:06
Yes, I'm sure it has. That doesn't mean it's not a ponzi scheme, or an economic bubble. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:14:50
Money is backed up by the bank. If you go to a bank, the bank will give you another form of currency. Money is also stable, since it's got a centralized bank.
It's also insured, in the case of the bank closing down.
There is no stability for cryptocurrencies. People telling you otherwise are lying to you.
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:49:33

You can already do that....
Are you ignorant of current banking technology that exists in first world nations? It's okay if you are, I don't expect everyone investing in cryptocurrencies to be from a first world nation with access to a bank.
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:51:22
No, that's not the only way.




A Ponzi scheme claims to rely on some esoteric investment approach and often attracts well-to-do investors, whereas pyramid schemes explicitly claim that new money will be the source of payout for the initial investments.[9]
A pyramid scheme typically collapses much faster because it requires exponential increases in participants to sustain it. By contrast, Ponzi schemes can survive simply by persuading most existing participants to reinvest their money, with a relatively small number of new participants.[10]
Cryptocurrencies have been employed by scammers attempting a new generation of Ponzi schemes. For example, misuse of initial coin offerings, or "ICOs," on the Ethereum blockchain platform have been one such method.[11] (per the Financial Times, "smart Ponzis").[12] The novelty of ICOs means that there is currently a lack of regulatory clarity on the classification of these financial devices, allowing scammers wide leeway to develop Ponzi schemes using these assets.[13]




Whereas Ponzi schemes will typically result in criminal charges after they are discovered by the authorities, other than pump and dump schemes economic bubbles do not typically involve unlawful activity, or even bad faith on the part of any participant. Laws are only broken if someone is perpetuating the bubble by knowingly and deliberately making misrepresentions to inflate the value of an item (as with a pump and dump scheme).
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:44:56
you've said it yourself; it's not attached only to bitcoin; it's in every "alt"coin
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:42:46
Yes, I will take great pleasure in the downfall of mostly alt right people throwing their life savings at bitcoin lol
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:08:33
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:07:03
Yeah, that is a better term. I'll call it that from now on.
Fun fact: wikipedia already has crypto included in their definition of ponzi schemes.


and 


(cont,  explains bubbles for those unaware)

@_date: 2017-12-14 22:13:52
It doesn't do anything other than increase it's own value. (based on people's perception that this thing has value.)
Other coins claim to do things, I haven't researched them.
And as someone below has said, 


@_date: 2017-12-15 03:14:31
It's a currency that has no value except the value assigned to it by others who believe it to have value. It isn't backed up by anything and it certainly isn't insured. 
You'd be idiotic to believe it's a currency.
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:13:45
And now you realize one of the failures of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:23:31
Lol, every single time someone disagrees with crypto, you guys say "you're just mad you didn't buy in"
It's a meme at this point
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:04:32
I could give you a hundred scenarios in which those coins are stolen, and you'd think "that'd never happen though!"
This conversation is getting stale. You're not going to convince me, and I'm not going to convince you. Let's go back to laughing at each other's positions. 
Remember, this is a ponzi scheme, not a real investment in a company that grows by itself. It relies on new investors to grow.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:00:33
You're free to believe whatever you want to believe. 
Just remember, there's no insurance for bitcoin, it's all on you. (and also remember, millions are stolen yearly, with no way of tracing the hackers or getting the bitcoin back.)
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:16:45
I.E. it's a pyramid scheme.
I'm going to laugh my ass off when this sub enters crisis mode as the price keeps dropping as everyone pulls out.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:12:04
You're right; someone below corrected me. This isn't a pyramid scheme, it's a ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:08:10
A link to me paying attention to bitcoin for the last 5 years? sorry, I don't document what I do in my life daily.
And you're free to believe that, after all I've not given any links to back up my point of view, I'm just laughing at people who think bitcoin is the currency of the future.
It's almost as laughable as dippin dot's slogan, 'ice cream of the future'. But at least they know it's a joke.
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:28:01
Because they think they're smart for investing in a pyramid scheme.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:52:24
I'm done having this conversation dude.
There's no point in explaining to me why you think bitcoin is superior to other currencies *because it's not fucking backed up by anything*. I consider that a NEGATIVE. I'm not going to convince you it's a bad thing, because you truly believe it's a good thing. 
You're free to assign whatever value you want to crypto, but I assign it a value of 0. If someone offered to pay me in bitcoin for my work, I'd tell them to fuck off and give me USD.
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:05:48
If the only people who buy into it are the ones who have bitcoin, then the only people who stand to make a profit are those who hoard coins. If many people are hoarding coins, then the value of those coins is extremely volatile; subject to massive swings when someone wants to cash out.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:27:05
You guys seriously need to stop lecturing me on bitcoin. I've been watching this shit since 2011.
Read my other replies as to why decentralized banking is a bad thing, and why governments of the world will work together to kill it.
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:24:00
Lol, you're insane. Governments don't give a shit that you think it's too big to ban. If they're not making money from it, and their citizens are trasnferring away from the government's currency, they'll ban it overnight.
Bitcoin will never be used as a currency LOL. We already know that. 
Oh really? Because it sounds like you're the only person on this sub who knows that. Everyone else I've spoken to today has said "it's the currency of the future". 
Please don't become homeless.
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:22:00
Yes, and it'll take a few more years for it to burst. The value will keep rising, but that doesn't mean it's smart to invest. 
A bubble is a bubble not because it deflates slowly.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:25:47
I'm sorry, but I don't have a better term for it other than pyramid scheme. If you want to participate in it, that's fine. I'm not going to. I'm going to laugh at the people who do.
All currencies are pyramid schemes, except most are backed up by the government. What is bitcoin backed up by? Nothing. 
Gold at least has a use as something other than 'shiny, high value because other people value it highly". It's a resource that is used in many technologies. 
If the only thing increasing the price of bitcoin is how many people use it, then it's a pyramid scheme. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:09:32
The difference is that stockholders can pay attention to the company's actions and decide if they want to stay in or pull out.
For bitcoin, it's looking at whetheror not other people are staying in or pulling out; it's an economic bubble within a ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:56:15
Idk why you're limiting it to one year, I've already said it's going to burst in a "few years". 
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:18:58


I'm sorry, but that's not true. It only has value to those who assign it value. It does not have inherent value.
Again, I don't need lectures on how bitcoin works. I'm well aware. I do not think it's a safe bet. I think anyone who invests money into it is pissing away money. You're free to believe I'm retarded for thinking that, but I'm going to have the last laugh when the market collapses.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:37:53
No, because those companies *do things*.
If the company only existed to sell stock, and investors bought in on the idea that they could get other investors to invest in it and then pull out when they feel they've made enough, then you'd see more companies like that. That's essentially what bitcoin is; stock for a company that makes nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:32:50
RemindMe! 5 years "make fun of this guy"
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:46:11
So let me get this straight; you think that hackers will just ignore people's bitcoin wallets if it gets big enough? Or do you think most people are going to be ultra-secure with their wallets, in a way that they aren't with their normal cash on hand?
Because I can see most people thinking "oh this is good enough, I have an antivirus and a firewall"
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:13:28
lol, this meme about people being salty, is that the only defense you have? 
"people who don't buy into bitcoin are just salty they didn't buy into bitcoin!"
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:39:04
Enjoy the bubble while it lasts, like I said before, I really hope you don't lose your life savings in this. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:32:24
yes, I will, but I'm not sure you will if you keep your money in crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:19:20
All of those things have other uses though. Gold is used in many computer parts. Diamonds are sold as jewelry and shitty diamonds are used for powertools and industrial tools.
These things have value. Bitcoin is literally valueless. You are assigning it value based on it's 'rarity' and saying "look, it's a currency now"
Just think of it this way: If there were only 10 people on earth who wanted bitcoin, then bitcoin would be relatively worthless, as there are millions of bitcoin. Each one would be worth barely anything. 
Now, the pool has grown to millions of people. There is still the same amount of bitcoin, it doesn't change. The value has risen drastically because of the expanding pool; this leads to deflation, which causes people to hold on to their coins, because they believe the value will be greater in the future. As people sell their coins, the pool shrinks, and the value decreases. This leads to a massive drop.
There are many reasons why bitcoin is going to fail, and all of them lead to the same result; economic bubble in a ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:51:20
It's a ponzi scheme, someone corrected me earlier.
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:10:27
Please read the entire post instead of picking and choosing what you agree with.
Just because it doesn't fit the exact definition doesn't mean it doesn't operate exactly like a ponzi scheme. 
But hey, whatever helps you feel better about your financial future. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:14:58
Maybe. I hope you pull out before you lose everything.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:22:05
You assume other people are as stupid as you are and actually buy into this pyramid scheme.
They're not going to throw their savings at cryptocurrencies. They are going to want a tangible investment.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:09:54
A pyramid scheme can be many things.
When you're assigning value to something that has no inherent value because of the amount of people using that thing, you're in a pyramid scheme. 
When you're encouraging other people to invest in this thing in order to drive the price higher, it's a pyramid scheme (and a bubble).
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:32:53
Dude, I've been watching bitcoin since it was 2$ each, and only talked about on 4chan.
It's a pyramid scheme, and if you can't see that, I don't know what to tell you other than good luck. 
I really hope you don't treat this as your main currency, and I *really* hope you don't "invest" what you're not willing to lose.
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:09:11
In a Ponzi scheme, the schemer acts as a "hub" for the victims, interacting with all of them directly. In a pyramid scheme, those who recruit additional participants benefit directly. (In fact, failure to recruit typically means no investment return.)
A Ponzi scheme claims to rely on some esoteric investment approach and often attracts well-to-do investors, whereas pyramid schemes explicitly claim that new money will be the source of payout for the initial investments.[9]
A pyramid scheme typically collapses much faster because it requires exponential increases in participants to sustain it. By contrast, Ponzi schemes can survive simply by persuading most existing participants to reinvest their money, with a relatively small number of new participants.[10]
Cryptocurrencies have been employed by scammers attempting a new generation of Ponzi schemes. For example, misuse of initial coin offerings, or "ICOs," on the Ethereum blockchain platform have been one such method.[11] (per the Financial Times, "smart Ponzis").[12] The novelty of ICOs means that there is currently a lack of regulatory clarity on the classification of these financial devices, allowing scammers wide leeway to develop Ponzi schemes using these assets.[13]
Economic bubbles are also similar to a Ponzi scheme in that one participant gets paid by contributions from a subsequent participant (until inevitable collapse). A bubble involves ever-rising prices in an open market (for example stock, housing, cryptocurrency,[14][15] or tulip bulbs) where prices rise because buyers bid more, and buyers bid more because prices are rising. Bubbles are often said to be based on the "greater fool" theory. As with the Ponzi scheme, the price exceeds the intrinsic value of the item, but unlike the Ponzi scheme:
In most economic bubbles, there is no single person or group misrepresenting the intrinsic value. A common exception is a pump and dump scheme (typically involving buyers and holders of thinly-traded stocks), which has much more in common with a Ponzi scheme compared to other types of bubbles.
Whereas Ponzi schemes will typically result in criminal charges after they are discovered by the authorities, other than pump and dump schemes economic bubbles do not typically involve unlawful activity, or even bad faith on the part of any participant. Laws are only broken if someone is perpetuating the bubble by knowingly and deliberately making misrepresentions to inflate the value of an item (as with a pump and dump scheme).
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:57:59
These people are living in a fantasy land. They truly believe bitcoin is "the currency of the future".
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:55:58
I think governments around the world are going to begin to ban it as they see it for what it is. After that, many people will pull out, other people will freak out as they've bought in above the 'current' price, and they'll either sell to save money or lose everything.
Then you'll have people who insist it'll return to the high price it once was, and they'll remain on-board.
But by then it'll be too late, the currency will be dead. Investors will avoid it like the plague it is, as they know it's not based on anything other than word of mouth and hype.
That's just one route. The other route is it being a bubble and hitting 60k as mentioned in this thread, then dropping to 1k. 
Then there's the hope everyone (including you) have that this currency will somehow become the currency for the world since it has no centralized bank and it's anonymous. This is the most retarded thing I've heard in my life. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:53:51

...Do you honestly think deflation of a currency is going to lead to people going "oh yeah it's fine that he has 1000000000 bitcoin because he got in on it early. I know we only have .000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 bitcoins, but we'll make it work."
You're not thinking about the long term (50-100 years). you're only concerned with the next 5 years.
