Hm. I didn't make that connection. I feel like you just taught me something about myself that seems really obvious once you pointed it out. I use the exact same points on both. Nothing is perfect, many of histories best ideas were considered horrible ideas until they worked. Thanks for the observation.

Haha I don't live there at the moment, I'll be moving there once I finish school. That is us in the back of an auto rickshaw. I love India, it is the future of democracy and capitalism for the world!

I definitely plan on putting up pictures and some details on challenges/benefits.

This was in Delhi, we were thinking Agra may be best; but I'll have to check out Ubud if they already have friendly infrastructure, thanks for the tip!

Kind of a long story, but the short of it is that I want to influence public policy one day and pretty rabidly support the potential of crypto currencies.

It'll be 100% bitcoin; we are doing a good amount of research to find ideal locations etc, and documenting everything.

The title says the wedding is in November, this is just a picture of us on a day out.

Young guys get married and divorced to the first girl who shows them the time of day, it's so common that everyone who's served on active duty is familiar with the stereotype. The term for their spouses is "dependa's", if you google that phrase it will make more sense.

I definitely am.

Thanks! We are doing a Hindu wedding and an English one, the Hindu one will be bitcoin.
