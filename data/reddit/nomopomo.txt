Okay so I'll assume you're correct that some government somewhere subisizes internet connections to inconvenient houses.  
  
So what? That's not a good thing, and I'd rather they didn't. People should bear the costs of their actions. If you choose to live in a remote location because that's your preference, fine. But don't expect me to pay for people to hook you up to the internet.    
  


  
Yeah, and? That's why being poor is generally not considered as fun as being rich - you don't get as high of a material wealth as rich people. That's what this capitalism thing is all about.

Man I don't have to explain to you how a private road system would work. I don't know exactly how road businesses could work - I'm just some fucking guy. The owness is on your to say what is specific about road infastructure that makes it impossible to work without a central violent institution.  
  
Guess what, I bet you have no idea how McDonald's gets all those ingredients and coordinates millions of people to just conveniently be at a location 5 minutes from your house ready to make you a hamburger within seconds of requesting one. How'd all those buns get made just in time for you? Also, HOW THE HELL did the mud on the restaurant floor get cleaned?

I just talked with the guys over at bitteller, a Winnipeg based bitcoin ATM company, and they're saying multiple ATM's in Winnipeg will be on line within the week, and they say they will achieve "saturation" within a couple months in Winnipeg. I don't know what that means precisely but that's what they said.  
  
Also this ATM is a buy only, they say the ones coming out later this week are buy and sell.

My point is that there are lots of industries of which you have now clue how they function. Yet, because you cannot think of the details of how a private transportation industry could function, you then morally support the world's largest most violent institutions extort people at gunpoint in order to provide some infastructure as they see fit.  
  
Since this is such a morally repulsive outcome, the owness is on you or other supporters of the government to show why the world couldn't go on without it. It's not on us to say "Ohhh you know here's how a private _____ would work". And a slave needn't come up with a convincing cotton-farming business model before he's granted his freedom.

Personally I won't do business with cavirtex after seeing Josephs senate hearing a while back, where he was begging the Canadian government to raise its barriers to entry in the bitcoin space, for gods sake the government officials were trying to convince Joseph we don't need regulations! As a libertarian and an anarcho capitalist I refuse to support such a blatant attempt to use money and influence to point the guns of government towards their competitors in an obvious attempt to gain monopoly. Seriously anyone here watch that?  Disgusting.

Right, but the difference is that the police don't know that I just illegally downloaded my textbooks, and they have much less at stake.  
  
Bitcoin is self-tracking - the government can know every transaction anyone makes. And virtually their entire system depends on their ability to control money. Basically everything is at stake for them.

I get the feeling that most of her answers are politically motivated. For instance, when asked if government currencies are threatened by bitcoin, she responds that "bitcoin is meant to compliment, not replace existing currencies".  
  
This is absolutely wrong, and I think I'm with the vast majority of people in this sub that think bitcoin is headed to replace government currencies. Why would she paint such an inaccurate picture? To appear less scary to gvmt officials?  
  
The whole point of this is to subvert the central banking system!  
  
Edit:  
I think this is also a general phenomenon where the talking heads that supposedly represent Bitcoin or speak for its users will take overly weak and what I think are inconsistent positions on things. I often see it here in this sub too. People will say for instance, "You know, the US dollar is the number 1 currency for drug trade". Why would you apologize for the fact that Bitcoin enables drug trade? We're all (most of us here) Libertarians and we think it's perfectly fine that Btc is used that way. I wish more drugs were traded with bitcoin.   
  
When people are interviewed, and the prospects of tax evasion and general evasion of financial law comes up, most interviewees sort of bow their head and make up some strange reason why the state can easily stop this and will even say that they welcome government 'guidance' in the area. Isn't anyone else baffled by this? The sole raison d'etre of this whole operation is to escape these rules. Why are spokespeople so afraid to say on TV "Yeah, this is going to enable millions to hide their assets from authorities, and there may be no way for the government to stop this. Yes, btc does enable illegal black markets and the gvmt probably can't do anything about that either. Yes, btc DOES pose a huge threat to the central banks of the existing 'great' nations, and that's exactly what it was intended to do." ?

Yeah you can accept, hide and use cash but it is not as secure as btc (can be easily robbed lost destroyed etc), and can't be moved across borders or be exchanged around the world pseudonymously. This property of btc allows for large scale under the table businesses which can sell worldwide without leaving paper trail.

OP you should watch this video right now  
  
  
To answer your question:  
  
To collect transaction fees, you have to mine a block. In fact, that's the whole point of mining - miners mine blocks which  contain the information about transactions that have been broadcasted since the last block. The miner who finds the block first is rewarded with the transaction fees, plus an additional reward (that's the 25 btc).  
  
Right now, transaction fees aren't even significant anyways.
