I dont know, I really dont think this can happen without enforcement from a higher power. Knowing how humans operate we can likely expect every tom dick and harry to have their own coin... Especially once corporations realize that they can potentially pay their employees less by creating their own coin. Then they can claim it was a raise! Everyone who works for Walmart makes 4 USD an hour + 20 Walmart coins! That's a huge raise!

Nobody cares about dead kids. Now if he came out and said he was going to force everyone to pay for Skyrim mods then some heads will role.

Yeah they cant know your transactions. However when I look at peoples wallets online I am able to see how much money they have received.
We can see how much money Edward Snowden has received in donations. 
That information IS public. Which if you are stupid and make lots of oddball transactions for random amounts like 0.03456222 bits all the time those numbers can be partially tracked back to you.
People need to think that when they make transactions that look like credit cards and phone numbers you are kind of undermining your own privacy.

Yeah, how are they going to solve this exactly? This wave is going to hit soon if it hasnt already. Hell the only two things I give a damn about right now is the stability of the currency and knowing that I can use it in more places. 
After that fuck all if anyone tells me not to do it. I might even ask for my paychecks to be Bitcoins.
How are they going to solve this problem? Its a giant shit storm for them and its coming!

bite == makes transaction without checking if there is a code like 52028531 in the amount which can be a unique code someone can look up online.

Should we mention that USD has some pretty big flaws with counter fitting and such too?

I never meant to say anything about unseating the government. Thats not the ideal situation to come out of this.
The ideal situation is all bullshit repetitive life crushing low skill jobs are eliminated and we begin getting a Universal Basic Income. Which then has massive impacts on poverty and quality of life for everyone.
All of this would be forced into play. The government would either be forced to do this or it will just suicide itself basically. What these technological advances are doing is working towards a final checkmate situation.

You are leaving out one really huge detail.
Bitcoin based systems dont need as many employees as a standard banking system. In the end there will always be wealthy elite. That's not what is going to change.
The number of jobs is going to though. Wealth inequality is going to skyrocket as a result. The beauty of this situation is that it will happen due to incentives that drive the current system. The more greedy the top are the better the results will be down the line.
The end result is that the government will be forced to react or risk systemic failure.
So the op does have a point, but its not quite brought to light in a step by step manor. Its just another example of automation and the various effects its going to have. Bitcoin is the self driving trucks of banking.

I call bullshit, they are doing this primarily to sell and use the information. That's why they exist. Collecting stuff just to make it hard to access goes against the reason for doing it in the first place.
The only answer to this kind of activity is to encrypt EVERYTHING.
@_date: 2015-04-22 02:40:31
Bullshit, its a giant collection of information sitting on huge raid with security run by humans. They sit in the office laughing at pictures like its 4Chan.
They acted fucking surprised when Snowden left like "HOW CAN THIS HAPPEN OMG! ; ;"
Seriously, your shit is out there right now. I dont care how many Keys or how secure they say they are. One fucking thumb drive gets in there and its a secret pay check from the highest bidder.
@_date: 2015-04-22 03:07:48
The best thing is no problem at all. Everyone keeps their information locked away and nobody has free access to it.
You remove the entire problem with the simple answer. Demanding trust is the first major red flag that you cannot trust that person.

Dear New York: You fucking guys haven't even set it up so I can buy a slice of pizza with my credit card. Bitcoin is hardly possible in this environment let alone subway cars not as old as my dad. I am hoping when I visit Tokyo I will feel like I am in a more cutting edge environment.
@_date: 2015-04-22 02:17:52
As someone who just dropped a pretty hefty chunk of money for taxes I have to say that having someone do my taxes for me would be amazing!
@_date: 2015-04-22 20:32:50
It feels like any time I read about Ripple it advertises things that Bitcoin does better in a way that makes it sound like Bitcoin is unable to compete. Its really strange.
For example "Ripple allows next generation of digital transactions over the internet! Take that Bitcoin!"
Like... um?

Personally I kind of like the idea of making or losing 5 bucks while I take a nap. The problem is when I buy should I wait for the price to drop or should I just say fuck it?
@_date: 2015-04-27 04:52:23


Every single 99 cent pizza place, every single street vender take cash only. On top of that every single convenient store has a minimum of like 10 bucks or more if you dont use cash.
Every fucking one of them in Manhatten.
New York city is supposed to be cutting edge but outside of time square all I see is the 1970-1980s. Dont even get me started on the terrible internet the city has. Lack of Wifi maybe 2 places you can get decent nachos at 3 in the morning. The place is ancient.

What if someone cracks the encryption of certain wallets 10-20 years from now and is able to publicly display everyone's transactions? Its not outlandish that the source code for a wallet might one day fall into the wrong hands or one simple loophole.
Whats most interesting about this particular risk is that its a matter of time before something along these lines happens. Not only that but if someone took a large sum of coins from me one day I would absolutely be willing to give my wallet information to investigators.
Encryption provides temporary privacy. So its a real risk that 5-20 years someone is going to know all of your transactions and someone will figure out if you took their money one day.

side note:
If Walmart opened its own coins and figured out a way to make them worth a decent amount they could give everyone in the company a raise with no actual cost to the company.
Weird thought of the day.
@_date: 2015-04-22 23:01:37
When I learned about the existence of Ripple this was the first article to appear. I saw this and it was my first impression. Then I learned that its centralized and now they can just shut your account one day because you said something they dont like.
At this point the currency eats babies as far as I am concerned.
@_date: 2015-04-22 03:52:35
They haven't prevented anything. They are only useful for retroactive assessments. They are a tool for the FBI and CIA to better do their jobs. Which is a problem because.
1. The FBI shouldn't have that much power. 
2. The CIA is an insane rogue agency.
So the NSA pretty much exists for little else other than to make things worse.
@_date: 2015-04-22 02:16:06


The implications of this run deeper when you consider that encryption is the tip of the iceberg compared to everyone hiding in a veil of false information. The quality of everything will go down when people have 14 facebook accounts running bots that pretend to do random things just to hide one person who doesnt like being watched by the NSA.
@_date: 2015-04-22 03:30:28
Yeah, stop trying to micromanage some hugely complex topic that ends up causing hundreds of other problems with no benefit at all.
The Boston bombers are the NSA Legacy. They had everything they needed, either they wanted it to happen or they were unable to prevent it. Pick one.
Everything is better or at least roughly the same if the NSA completely died.
@_date: 2015-04-22 21:29:35
I guess we are going to see a lot of fake coins crop up. Especially once the big banks start to fully freak out. Ripple sounds horrible and I would pay money not to have its currency at this point. I want to see big banks have a tantrum! I dont want to lesson the blow.
I want to drink their damn tears man!
@_date: 2015-09-26 19:21:46
If we are talking about bitcoin then supporting the product by directly sending bits to your favorite people rather than to some corporate entity makes a lot more sense.
@_date: 2015-04-22 22:39:56
Yeah! Also its titled "Forget Bitcoin! Got Ripple?"
So like if you read this you can see them talking about stuff that Bitcoin already does but in a tone like its some new thing Ripple brings to the table. 


What like Bitcoin is loaded with hidden fees and delays right?


Yeah! Take that Bitcoin, these guys made "progress" toward a global currency that operates as easily as sending an email! They must have burned the midnight oil for that kind of progress!


No way! This blows Bitcoin out of the water!
So yeah lots of /s going on here.
@_date: 2015-09-26 19:40:10
Well, lets say you are a fan of a musician and really like that persons singing voice. I as a fan, dont give a damn about the suits. If I find that persons bitcoin I send my donations in that direction.
Its not outlandish that this will become a trend even if it misses a lot of important issues regarding infrastructure that made the person famous in the first place.
So when a corporation does something even slightly shady they better be ready to get circumvented in ways they really cant control. Maybe there will have to be clauses in contracts that make it illegal for an artist to have a bitcoin account. yay.
@_date: 2015-04-22 02:22:21
Yep, for example, look at Edward Snowden, then pretend he never decided to be a whistle blower but rather sold the information he collected on the black market.
In an environment where Edward Snowden can happen, everyone has access to your information.
@_date: 2015-09-30 23:18:15
awesome, as I am about to make a video to talk about this exact topic in regards to how people criticize the social networking platform, TSU, for making all of the posts about making money.
When the honest truth is, building value is extremely common on all forms of social media anyway. Its been this way for decades already. People act surprised that Bitcoin can be a thing when gold in World Of Warcraft has held value practically since day one. A single weapon skin in CS:GO can be worth as much as $5000~ USD.
Reddit karma actually holds monetary value too. Likes on facebook too! The number of followers on Twitter holds value. The number of followers on Twitch. Anything from any mmo or video game with multiplayer holds value.
This is observable practically everywhere in many different ways and I feel its an extremely important thing to consider especially in a day and age moving heavily to automation. In a society run by basic income and no minimum wage, that twitter/TSU/YouTube account with a few thousand followers might be your only way to get an edge!
@_date: 2015-04-22 20:16:26
If that's all they did then it would be nice! I can see a strong argument to forcing the NSA into helping people become more secure and do away with all other activities.
Until that happens I just cant say the NSA is a positive force. The bad far out weighs any good they do.
@_date: 2015-04-19 01:53:41
Well I am not referring to scams but rather the recent reports of people being mugged and having their Bitcoin wallets emptied.
Scams are a much tougher topic, but outright theft by people who dont bother or understand how to properly obfuscate is more what I am talking about.
@_date: 2015-10-25 21:48:49
Interesting troll as China is home to a pretty hefty real money trade industry where things like gold in World Of Warcraft hold pretty steady values.
