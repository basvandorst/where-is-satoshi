You are looking for Casascius Bitcoins, they are illegal (status) and only as collectors items now. The price if you can find one is Approx. $30,000 USD for 1 BTC.

Yeah man if you have one hold onto it. As of Nov, 2013, Mike Caldwell suspended sales  of physical bitcoins. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a branch of the Treasury Department, informed him before, that minting physical bitcoins qualifies him as a money transmitter business, which means he needs to register at the federal level and probably get state licenses too.

Dear misinformed noob, it’s been 28 days since BTC first hit $10,000 and it’s grown since then to over $13,000.  In 28 days.   Exactly what reality altering drugs are you taking? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:17:43
Lol these noobs. The sky is falling OMG.  No, this is how it’s always been.

99.9% of MFs on this thread are saying "this is exactly what will happen because of X, Y and other BS" and because you cant predict based on the past, they then go ahead and predict the price in 365 days from now like some type of modern crypto Nostradamus. 99.9% of everyone will be wrong. Even me about this post. Why? time travel bro, hasn't been invented yet.

With 100% certainly the HODL hasn’t let us down yet.  In 8 years.  ��
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:51:09
We’re just over $300. Away from that and have 12 hours to go.  It’s a win either way.

This hurts to type, I started getting interested in BTC in 2011, I ended up buying a few here and there a few years later and ended up with 98 BTC. 
Long story short I held it for what seemed like forever and one day I looked at my account and thought boy that BTC really didn't move like I thought it would, and CASHED OUT. 
FML. For reals. I got back in start of this year and am clawing my way back, now I HODL for life. 
It took me a few bottles of cheap whiskey (couldn't afford the good stuff, I wasted it on selling) to get over this. 
Yeah, that one stung. I had the foresight and then lost it out of frustration that it wasn't moving fast enough. 
Im a real life HODL meme.

I LIKE IT!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:36:27
Fuck man, **I'm giving you gold**, mainly because I feel for you, I bought a belt from China with BTC, at the time it was 4 BTC and yeah I still have it, a motherfucking $24,000. mf belt. Thenm there was that time I also bought hundreds and then a few months later thought man this BTC thing isnt moving. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:59:44
We call it a sale.  Even a 50% slaughter (I don’t see it happening) yet let’s say it does, is still only just over 8 weeks of gains.  And with any good half off sale you get people lining up at the door to buy.  
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:28:06
This is almost comedic.  
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:06:50
This felt like watching grandparents trying to explain the internets. Its a series of tubes. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:27:56
OK, it goes down, by 50% 
Bro, thats only 8 weeks of gains. 
Who cares if it crashes. Its just a temporary SALE. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:03:50
Just HODL and buy on any dip.  Your future self will buy you a drink.  Or an entire bar. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:44:17
Where can I purchase these posters? 
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:41:16
NLS, they accepted credit cards and PayPal.  I don't even think they are around anymore. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:15:26
The masses are coming.  Once critical mass hits we will see a parabolic rise of $1,000 to $2,000 in short periods of time. At this stage there is a greater than  50% chance of people freaking out and cashing, causing a correction, or as us Hodlers say BTC will go on sale.  Causing more buying and an even greater surge.

With Coinbase 98% of customer funds are stored offline. They distribute bitcoin geographically in safe deposit boxes and vaults around the world, drives and paper backups are also distributed geographically in safe deposit boxes and vaults around the world.
Most storage with coinbase is Cold.

HODLERS don’t sleep!! I mean we could if we weren’t so damn anxious. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 00:31:54
This made me smile.  I've been chipping away and I'm going to HODL all the way. It feels good to be hardcore, weathered the storm and still pushing ahead.  Thanks for the great message.  
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:46:28
I thought I was an IDIOT. BTC hits like $8,000 and An hour later I'm like man I'm a genius. 
Lesson learned: HODL don't fuck around with trading its too unpredictable (for me at least) 
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:00:17

Bitcoin doest advertise, never has. This is fantastic news for Crypto, that is unless you are shilling a shitcoin or a scam wallet. Goodbye scam advertisers!
