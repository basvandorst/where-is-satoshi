IOTA is not a shitcoin it was just overhyped. It's a long term hold at this point.

Is this new copy pasta? lmao
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:02:19
Do you FUD ETH every chance you get?
@_date: 2018-01-24 02:54:09
I thought bitcoin was a peer-to-peer electronic cash system?
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:28:51
This is satire right?
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:02:21
When the Fork happened in August any physical holders of bitcoin instantly became owners of an identical amount of bitcoin cash. Coinbase advertising themselves as an online wallet was obligated to give out bitcoin cash equal to the amount of bitcoin you held at the time.

It's more like:

HERE WE GOOOOOOOOOOOO
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:18:01
Lmao wtf does that even mean? Do things not change over time?
FMA is not perpetual. HODL is a reddit meme. The better product almost always wins in the end. At the very least BTC is severely over valued as is the whole market.
@_date: 2018-02-24 16:25:51
People realized that bitfinex makes more money by not being a scam.
@_date: 2018-02-19 17:35:44
Doesn't take someone in TA too see this growth is crazy and will most likely correct. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:26:04
If you are confident it is going to keep falling you sell now and buy back in at a lower price. This is obvious. You make money on the run  back up then.
@_date: 2018-03-14 12:10:59
You didn't set a stop loss?
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:18:09
6hr charts look like we might test 8200 again. Still bullish tho.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:25:20
Damn, so almost a decade in and still no realistic pathway to mainstream adoption. How long are we supposed to wait?
XLM and Nano are arguably better products. Does it mean they will ever reach BTC's ATH marketcap? No one knows. Probably not.
If one of the main reasons your bullish on BTC is because some porn sites accepted it early I really won't be able to convince you otherwise on anything.
Just have to see how 2018 plays out.
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:25:01
The average BTC moon boy everyone.
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:50:31
lol!!1! Totally XD!!!
@_date: 2018-02-14 05:00:35
Except it was supposed to be a peer-to-peer electronic cash system.
You can argue its goal has changed, but originally it was supposed to be spent.

Tip Top analysis

Ehhh we broke channel support though. This dip was definitely more violent then the others.
@_date: 2018-03-15 00:29:04
Why do you think he doesn't know that?
@_date: 2018-03-15 00:41:49
Can I give a non meme answer w/o getting in trouble? I hold some NANO and Ambrosus. Coins not competing with btc, but trying to solve real world problems.
It's sometimes boring to be only in BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:21:03




Why would you not sell then?
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:53:27


Sorry I thought bitcoin was a peer-to-peer electronic cash system not a store of value like gold. Fees are low now, but when/if traffic picks up high fees will never be conducive to day to day transactions.


Currently hold zero eth, but I don't know why that would matter anyway.


Autistic rambling about ethereum which has nothing to do with btc.


I have never heard anyone make such an argument. I honestly don't know what to say. You are just going to say "sex sells" and leave it at that?


Literally can say the same thing about 90% of bitcoiners.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:13:23


Of course their is. It's just not BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-22 05:51:31


The main cause was extremely overbought positions on a 100% 2 week rally. People are going to take profits. Never forget that.
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:14:33
Is a head and shoulders drop coming.....?
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:38:42


WTF? Then you sell now. 
But earlier you said you wouldn't buy or sell now...
I really have no idea what your strategy is and it's honestly troubling. I really hope a lot of people don't share this mentality.
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:40:27
I am going to be called a FUDster, but I was really hoping BTC would rise slower this time around. At this pace we will hit 20k again by March. That is just too insane.
I am very bullish longterm and wouldn't dream of selling, but it just gives me that uneasy feeling again....
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:10:05
Bull trap bro.
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:29:15
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:06:49
Okay, that makes more sense then. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:47:27
Annnnnnnd here comes the profit taking......
@_date: 2018-02-19 17:01:25
Yea, but when sell high? xD
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:36:13
Emergency funds are actually liquid though....
@_date: 2018-02-20 18:47:09
How the fuck is this slow?
@_date: 2018-02-22 18:28:43
Damn, Bulls seem whipped right now.
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:42:56
is Binance down for anyone else?
