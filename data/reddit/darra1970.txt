@_date: 2018-06-03 05:10:03
Lol yeah, agree but for me more like 20.00 every paycheck. But yes seems to average out better.
@_date: 2018-06-08 02:59:28

Wow you had over 20 Bitcoin? Jealous here! I started following last year when I first heard of Bitcoin. I dream of just obtaining 1 Bitcoin. Lol working on it. 
@_date: 2018-06-02 22:58:43
I know hoping I can get there!

Why does this make me feel like I'm in a room full of nerds?
@_date: 2018-03-25 03:23:04
Not just employees, heck no one can Rob them private keys secure, card transaction final to account no handling of cash by employees no holding up that business.

Whoa, now that's cool. I've never seen this. Have you used it much? (Forgive me fairly new here) I just clicked on it and read sounds a little confusing. Is it easier than it looks?

OHHHHHHH why couldn't I have heard about bit coin years ago, sucks I didn't even realize I was living in such a remote closed life. Aaaaa what a relief and secure feeling to even just have 1, instead I just heard and have like  .0005 I know don't laugh, I just started a few months ago, and dipping my toes alittle. Still somewhat apprehensive

Thank the stars above lol I have at least a measly .03.... But it's something, I'll still be the poor in the new society, but I guess I won't be broke. Lol

Sure it does no theft or robbery,  Lowers Ins. And cost of hours counting and depositing  reduces loss actually smart business.

I understand the not having and being basically a fine hair on a frog in this big asz pond. I studied from December. Dipped in small alittle every paycheck....and I mean small only about 20$ (don't laugh) It's what I knew I'd be able to walk away from ...Now overall I'm down at moment but I have faith in the fact this is the future! My investments may be small but they're growing, Trust that you can, and you will. I'm a single mother working a full time job making just over 12.00 per hour if I can do it so can you!

Well, I can honestly say I don't know Boo about TA, nor do I know Boo about calculus, machine learning, statisical machanics or much about any of this tech. The more I try n learn I feel my head about to explode. However I am investing in projects I can see being used and solve problems in today's economy. Project I believe are the future. I think I have some winners, and Heck I know I have some regrets.
