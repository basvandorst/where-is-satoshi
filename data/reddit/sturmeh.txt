It's utter bullshit. 
Assuming it was true, it would have to communicate with Intelligence orgs somehow.
What this post claims is that every networked device ever, like your router produced supports a secret protocol that the Intel CPU can use to secretly communicate with your ISP.
Lets assume that's true, so if I set up some MITM on an old ARM processor based computer and route all my networking through there, surely I should be able to see the "surveillance" packets or data.

You SHOULD just keep a copy of said private key...
You handled it, is reasonably UNBELIEVABLE to consider that you wouldn't have copied it at some stage, even inadvertently.
If they transfer the BTC to another wallet, that'll remove your ability to recover it, but that's their perogative, and probably something they'd only do if they were crypto savy.
Obviously, you can tell them you will be safekeeping a copy of their keys, and explain that they can transfer the BTC at any time to relinquish the possibility of you "stealing" them.
There's a few ethical concerns here, which you need to be comfortable with;
1. You give them an amount, that is a worth a ridiculously large amount in the future, they are oblivious of this, and you are tempted to 'spend' their BTC.
2. They claim to have lost the private key, and you never told them you kept a backup, is it still theirs? :P
3. You need to secure your copy of the private key reasonably well, if it were to be stolen then you'd be a liability.
**So it would be my recommendation to tell them you have a backup, explain what that means, and endeavour to remind them how much they have in the future.**
Edit: After reading  I'm conflicted as to whether you should tell them about the backup, the real advice here is to not be an asshole. :)

You agree to live within the society governed by the laws and systems put together by that society.
Such systems and laws dictate that you owe your society a portion of your income. Money that will be used to further your society. (Not always in ways that you personally agree with but in a way that's usually dictated by the majority, for example in a democracy.)
You are not oppressed as you are free to leave that system at any time and find one that suits you better, yet you don't.
You basically want to reap all the benefits that yield purely from tax paying citizens without contributing to them.
Yes, that's theft, as you're stealing from your society.

At the time they were donated I doubt people expected that they would be donating fractions of a million dollars (to be) to an unknown cause, but they also weren't parting with very much money either.
He's not sitting on the money so that he can become a billionare, he's sitting on the money because there are no plans to use the money yet.

So how exactly are you going to tessellate the non-square bits?
@_date: 2014-10-20 13:07:13
Yeah but consider how much money is in circulation.
Lets say you get paid $1000 USD a month atm just like the 10% of US residents who are employed (~31,892,900 people).
Collectively, you're paid out about 32 billion US dollars a month.
Now lets pretend you're all paid 0.1 BTC instead, you would collectively be paid out 3,189,290 BTC every month, which is just over a seventh of all the Bitcoins that will ever exist.
The problem is that in this hypothetical scenario; BTC is essentially worthless, and USD is incredibly inflated, BUT they've probably printed an insane amount of it to compensate. You can't just 'print' BTC to account for inflation.
Your monthly salary could definitely be 0.1BTC, but it couldn't be everyone's.

Have someone you trust maintain a wallet with a fixed address, and to tell you if they ever lose control of the wallet.
Sign transactions to that address from your holdings (keep these up to date, especially if the trusted contact needs to update their address).
In the event of your death, ask that the transactions be executed, and that the trusted contact can distribute the coins as per the will.
This removes the need to "leave" access to sign anything.

Shitty wallet or not, that's a 4.3KB tx.
Even at 1 sat/byte it's going to cost around $19 usd.
Your best bet is to export the private key, and send them all to a new address with a 1sat/byte fee for all the significant inputs and a 0 sat/byte fee for anything that would end up sending 0. (It may eventually propagate.)
You can send single inputs with no fee over time, they'll eventually be processed, but it sounds like that'll take you a while. (You'll also end up with the same problem on the other end!)

Percentages can be very misleading.
If you take $1 and increase it by 900%, you have $10.

Use a exchange; they vary depending on where you live and what fiat you're after.
Fees are fixed (or transaction size based) amounts paid to miners to include/confirm a transaction.
You usually have to be "cleared" due to international anti-money laundering requirements.
Satoshi/bit means price per size of transaction that will be paid as a fee for it to be mined. (The higher this is the faster your transaction will be accepted.)
A transaction clears in the next block if the fee is higher than average and/or is relayed relatively early in the block mining cycle. This means you only have to wait 10 minutes for the transaction to complete.

There are a few unknowns in the system, such as the bitcoins held by the botnets, and a large sum of bitcoins that are owned by one unknown entity.
If BTC is to succeed, then it is NOT imperative that you invest now (only ideal).
It will experience continuous growth if successful as a investment/security/trade medium or otherwise crash.
At least once the unknowns are ironed out.

The issue with this graph is it assumes a linear growth of the asset demand.
Bitcoins are not normal in that they have a controlled supply that halves as time goes by, which results in an exponential demand.
The correct graph would see the dotted line as an exponential one. (That's not to say the valuation won't drop far below it at times.)

You're not an authority, therefore the bills become your problem once you put them in the ATM.

I think it's pretty neat, but it's hard to spend/transfer just 'some' of the BTC on a paper-wallet without taking the paper.

Potentially a hard fork, which means you'll want control of the wallet when it splits into BTC and BTU. (So you can spend/trade both.)

An address is not 'known' to the blockchain until it is used, but it can certainly exist offline.
If the key is generated offline and only the address is made public than it can be certain that it is secure. (At least until it is spent once.)

You can export the private keys for all the addresses that have money on your PC and import them into your phone. (There's a way to convert formats.)

Ah right, that's quite concerning.
I used to work in one of the banks in a department closely related to fraud, and I saw a lot of bitcoin traders accounts being closed for fraud related activity, there was never a "policy" that restricted bitcoin traders from having accounts.
That's why I ask, it seems like word has gotten around and bitcoin trading is just considered high risk of fraud because not everyone is as diligent as you at checking ID's or using the right channels.

This is a "democracy" based currency which is currently having trouble deciding on a big issue, and whilst the prices rise, are facing larger and larger transaction fees.
There's obviously room for things to go wrong, but there's also the chance we overcome all these adversities and soldier along.
There's also a chance that another cryptocurrency might be the one that comes and saves the day.
Holding bitcoin isn't a "foolproof" investment, it's about faith.
Don't make the mistake of believing it's a guaranteed investment that will definitely skyrocket to $100,000. (If that were the case, the price would be $100k.)

I'm kind of sick of clients forcing me to include 0.0005 (*cough* ARMORY) fee in ALL transactions.
If I want to move coins between all my addresses and consolidate funds, why would I want to pay a fee multiple times? 
Sure it's just 3c to send $100 to a merchant. But it's also 3 cents to move money from my encrypted wallet to my non-encrypted wallet and them another 3 cents to send it to my phone.
Seeing as I can move fiat money between banks and to out of an ATM and into another without so much as a 1c fee, I don't see this being 'beneficial'.
I know that it will take ages, but a transaction without a fee will eventually be confirmed.

Electricity cost is negligible now.
It was a concern when people first heard about Bitcoins, since nobody really speculated the value would climb this quickly to 60 times above parity with the US Dollar. (The Bitcoins you mined then cost much less in electricity than $60 each.)
It is still efficient to mine bitcoins at todays electricity cost, and ASIC's will be incredibly efficient (they operate at 1W per G/hash).
@_date: 2013-03-30 15:26:48
Sell them as you go?
If you want the Bitcoins as a personal investment, "buy" them from the business at the current exchange rate.
That will ensure your business does not face a risk and that all risk is inherent in your personal investment.
Also make sure you check the exchange rates at spot prices before you make any Bitcoin sales, as they can change dramatically over time.

That's true, but my biggest issue is that Armory never explains why it's forcing you to pay a fee. (Clearly)
I've gone and looked up all the compulsory fee conditions and there are a few ones I may have hit, but Armory never states them in the client. (It always just claims the transaction history is too big, which is true but uninformative.)

Honestly, a nice application that scans in wallets, shows you the current balance and notifies you when any transactions take place that involve them.
It should also allow you to render these addresses as QR codes so you can also accept payments.
There should be NO storage of private keys, and no generation of addresses. (Maybe later / additional feature?)

I have no doubt MtGox will adopt LTC and other crypto currencies in the future as demand rises for them, but remember that a lot of the BTC price is fueled by speculation, both by those who understand and by those who see growth and wish to ride the wave.
People have begun to buy into LTC because they feel they have 'missed the BTC wave' and/or they want to create a demand which speculators will jump on.
"Look the LTC has grown 400% in 2 days, I'd be crazy not to invest!" and it's true, heck I may invest a small portion myself, just to hedge the risk of missing the opportunity.
It's probably a smart idea to buy into LTC purely for monetary growth, but with the ultimate goal of converting them to BTC at a later stage, or during a BTC crash.

2.  Spending coins that are too “new” — Every time you send a transaction, you are spending “old” coins and creating “new” ones.  If you recently received coins and then immediately attempt to send those new coins to someone else (or yourself), the network will require a fee.  Armory will always select older coins first, but if you are sending a significant chunk of your wallet balance, Armory may have no choice but to use these “new” coins which require a fee.  Without this fee, a user with 1.0 BTC could send it back and forth between two addresses millions of times as a way to spam the network.
3. Transactions that combine lots of previous transactions — If you receive 100 separate transactions of 0.0001 BTC each, and then send 0.01 BTC to someone else, your transaction will contain references to all 100 previous transactions.  Even though 0.01 BTC is a “small” amount, the size of the transaction, in bytes, will be very large.  Especially large transactions may require more than 0.0005 fee.  If your wallet mainly receives lots of small transactions, your outgoing transactions will require a fee more often than not.

The later, a low fee escrow type implementation that doesn't rely on a specific third party. (Not one site.)
Need a way for A to send money to B through intermediary C in such a way that C cannot spend the money without another key from A (A+C or B+C key required to spend the money).
Additionally it would be good if the address the money could be sent to was restricted such that if A+C is used to sign the transaction, the money goes to B, and if B+C is used to sign the transaction, the money goes to A.
This means A could potentially withhold funds from the recipient B after they had complied with the escrow, however this seems like an unlikely outcome considering A cannot reclaim the funds, and the same goes in reverse.
Idea needs refining?

When opening your outer volume with truecrypt you have the option to specify the key to a hidden volume in order to protect it.
If not supplied, truecrypt has NO idea about the hidden volume, which is hidden in the free space of the outer volume.
When you open the outer volume under duress you obviously won't specify the hidden volume key to protect it as that informs the attacker of its existence.
As long as no writes are made to the outer volume there should be no issues.

You'll need to have placed a limit order (at least do it now if you haven't) before the crash, and the people with limit orders will slow the crash down as the acquire them. (Note that if you place a limit order for $10 and it slowly crashes to $0.1 then you might still pay almost $10 for them.)
I have never successfully mined a block, which I kick myself for, seeing as the 'small reward' back then is now a massive reward.
As for ASIC's I wouldn't discourage the aquisition of one, but there will be a finite period where they are SUPER EFFECTIVE, after which they will continue to operate as efficiently as GPU farms are operating today (whilst rending GPU farms obsolete). If you are able to get your hands on one during that period then definitely, you'll get your money back by mining a single block.

In order to execute an attack they would have to mine 6 blocks in secret, during which no other miner can create a more difficult next single block.
That scenario would be far less likely than one miner mining 6 in a row. Just attempting it would involve throwing 150 BTC away.
A 51% attack is another thing entirely, where they abuse their position as the majority of the network and ignore all other miners.

A bitcoin day is each day that passes without one particular bitcoin being spent (as you spend bits of a bitcoin, you can reduce the day by the same fraction of course).
So if 100 BTC has not been spent for 100 days, there are 10,000 bitcoin days associated with them (now imagine calculating this value for every fragement of bitcoin in the entire network, and adding the totals up).
When bitcoins are spent, their bitcoin days are destroyed, because they are 'fresh' again. Note that the inherent bitcoin days mean nothing in terms of value of a particular group of bitcoins.
Now if you take the total (as previously mentioned) then you can see how stagnant the supply of Bitcoins currently is. If the total of Bitcoin days is fairly low, then the entire supply of bitcoins is moving quite actively, where as if it's not, there is some serious hoarding going on.
So when we see a high rate of days destroyed, we can speculate that there will be some serious market movement in the near future, or that a whale has emerged from hiding.
It also reduces the number of coins we don't know if someone actually still has a private key for.

The average trades going through are 0.02 BTC, which is approximately $2.
