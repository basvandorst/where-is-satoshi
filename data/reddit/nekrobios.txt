Bitcoin is currently worth a measly 16 billion. It could easily tenfold with increased demand caused by LN. 
At the same time, transaction fees likely will find an equilibrium eventually, since we are not used to having 1 MB blocks full, and it's unlikely there is infinite demand for block chain transactions at any cost.
Seriously, just look at Bitcoin's chart, 1 year, 2 year, 5 year and you'll see that the increase in price more than compensates the mining fees.

BU cast the first stone. Contentious hard forks are reckless and absurd.
@_date: 2017-03-25 15:30:05
He is. If Bitcoin is supplanted by non-SHA256 PoW altcoins, let's see how high his earnings will be then. If he is motivated by profit, he is acting irrationally. If he is motivated by destroying Bitcoin, however …

What Jihan fails to understand is that fees are negligible compared to the value of the block reward, which would be increased with Lightning Network since Bitcoin will become much more useful. It would take many years and block reward halvings for this equation to change, and at that point, Jihan likely won't care anymore.
In contrast, he is now shooting himself in the foot by limiting Bitcoin's market cap with hard fork FUD, and thus his own earnings.
@_date: 2017-03-21 23:31:57
I like the idea of voting in a PoS manner to demonstrate what the economic majority (in one sense) prefers. I'm guessing it's strongly pro core.
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:52:15
I agree, that's the way forward now. As you say, it's encouraging he is motivated by profit. 
Time to get on a table with Jihan and explain to him why having a small piece of a 1 trillon pie is better than a big piece of a 10 billion pie.
Just think about the valuation Bitcoin would reach in a couple months should Jihan stand up and say "K guys, let's segwit". How much more money would he be making then?

Probably also because the Chinese, who are not part of the OECD, dominate this market (since 2013) and recently have a positive price premium vs Western exchanges again.

My point is that the beginning of exchange of information is September 2017, not January 2017, which is a piece of information OP's assumptions are based on.
@_date: 2016-12-28 09:05:16
The OECD says otherwise:

The biggest non-Chinese exchanges, Bitfinex and Bitstamp, are based in signatory countries. It would be interesting to hear from them regarding this matter.
@_date: 2016-12-28 01:58:59
If AEOI is the cause, wouldn't the date be September 2017? That's when the early adopter states will begin exchanging data. The cutoff date for accounts to be reported has been 1st January 2016.
So, people worried about spilling information would have fled before 2016, and people worried about their money being confiscated would have until September.
@_date: 2016-12-30 16:15:46
Now I see what oneaccountpermessage was trying to tell me, thanks clearing that up and sorry for the confusion. 
However, I believe this scenario would apply only if you only dealt with late adopter parties in addition to being tax resident in a late adopter country. Still, in that case, now would indeed be the last chance to escape data collection.

It's ok, instead, the south (Van Gogh's title bar) is now free to take over with orange and expand that way. Help us out if you can.

For anyone else looking to reclaim the tiles to the right that Germany and Netherlands are taking over, I've modified the PlacePaintBot and created [this script]( it will only target this 2 pixel stripe, painting it orange.
Instructions to run: 
1. Install TamperMonkey addon (Chrome, Firefox)
2. Create new script
3. Paste text from Pastebin link and save
4. Run it with r/place open in one tab

They took the bottom half from us in an act of aggression.
@_date: 2017-04-02 10:21:12
I don't know who did that, but clearly it was a stupid move and I think Bitcoiners will leave Megaman alone now.
@_date: 2017-04-02 18:09:47
I think [this]( is the area we should claim for now since it looks easy. Then, consolidate IMO.
If we could come together with proposals for this area, I think we could find a good one and have consensus.

Don't fight each other, fight the USA. **Orange westwards!** Later on, we'll decide on a BIG logo and text.
For now, we just need to secure a larger area.
@_date: 2017-04-02 18:56:45
That one isn't even centered and it's the same size as either of the two existing logos. Why not conquer and create something much bigger?
@_date: 2017-04-02 19:45:02
How do you want to form an alliance with Van Gogh? They couldn't hold their territory, they lost. We take the scraps and try to defend it them. Ally with someone else.
@_date: 2017-04-02 16:20:27
First [defend against Italy]( or we will have nothing left. Redrawing right now is wasting tiles.
Edit: Now that Italy is fought off, I would really suggest we first take the rest to the left of us, and later on create something much bigger. [Look at what Monero, a tiny altcoin, accomplished](
@_date: 2017-04-02 09:21:46
Exactly, make the rainbow your ally to defeat the French.
Also make use of Megaman, let him expand into Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-04-02 21:18:20
See the red emerging on Bitcoin's orange in the picture? That was the right part of the tricolor Italy was trying to draw before we beat them.
@_date: 2017-04-02 23:46:39
You have my vote.
Now sticky this, u/Bashco.
@_date: 2017-04-02 12:41:25
I think we got the upper hand now as America wakes up (watch r/Bitcoin readers climb from 400 to 800). I agree it looks better, but we can do it on France's territory as we claim it back. France goes to sleep, Bitcoin doesn't.

Manually is always the most fun, but go ahead and run it with me once you sleep/get busy.
I agree with you, that's why I am doing this. Once we have asymmetry to the right, people will see the need to resolve it by expanding west.
@_date: 2017-04-02 13:32:38
Yes, but America wakes up now and France will go to sleep next. Therefore, we can retaliate, win and keep the territory we gained with bots.
@_date: 2017-04-02 19:53:47
This one would be perfect in the space we already have. We can expand to the west without major problems.
@_date: 2017-04-06 00:17:18
Bitcoin Judas 
@_date: 2017-04-02 19:36:22
Let's try do this first: 
@_date: 2017-04-02 18:50:29
Alright, huge opportunity: Since Van Gogh to the south is being taken over by r/void (the black expanding thing from its bottom left corner), we can take over at least its title bar. **EXPAND ORANGE!**
@_date: 2017-04-02 18:39:48
If it does get deleted, I'd suggest rebuilding it vertically rather than horizontally. The problem is that because of the Van Gogh Title, we've lost lots of height, and dearly need that space for a bigger Bitcoin logo. Another solution could be to use France's flag since it has the same colors.
@_date: 2017-04-02 18:52:51
There is no good coordinated effort in fixing logos, it is multiple parties fighting against each other. Until we have a good proposal, it is much easier to secure some more space, while we still have the opportunity!
Van Gogh doesn't fight back. The other Bitcoiners do. It's more efficient.
@_date: 2017-04-02 15:53:16
Italy has a small presence on Reddit (which is why they lost to the French), whereas we are many. Just fight red with orange and they will withdraw.
@_date: 2017-04-03 07:12:27
Why help them maintain? The Bitcoin logo used to be there. France invaded us while the US was sleeping in the first place.
@_date: 2017-04-02 17:38:32
Finish off the US first before starting the next fight.
@_date: 2017-04-02 16:34:37
I agree. [Here]( a simple plan to accomplish this.
@_date: 2017-04-02 15:39:23
At this point, I say we simply invade left, while defending against Italy. Everything above the Van Gough painting title should be ours. There's nothing important there, and with a large orange area, we will be able to create a new, bigger logo and text.
Borders to respect: Eiffel Tower, Van Gogh, Germany.
Just make everything orange.

Reddit created a game for April Fools called r/place where everyone draws one pixel at a time. Check out Bitcoin's logo [here](

@_date: 2017-04-02 19:02:05
It will would take a fraction of the time to take over the Van Gogh title bar, and then we could create something actually decent. I just don't see as completing this before the opportunity is gone because, again, multiple proposals are infighting.
@_date: 2017-04-02 21:38:25
Do it, take [this]( proposal, have someone edit it to the current location (we can move to the west and south easily if we need more space) and sticky that shit. 
It's not getting any better than this proposal.
@_date: 2017-04-02 16:52:50
Yeah, I wish people would turn them off and focus on our [new goals](
@_date: 2017-04-02 09:43:29
New plan: Let Megaman expand into Bitcoin and focus only on defending against the French in the top right corner. This way, it's 2v1.
Keep in mind that the French have a different timezone than the mostly American dominated Bitcoin, so we only need to hold out for a few hours until the US wakes up.
@_date: 2017-04-03 07:19:23
Even Monero has a bigger logo than Bitcoin. Can we now start expanding the orange?
@_date: 2017-04-02 18:01:23
Yeah, because although we are a large subreddit, people would rather work on multiple tiny logos than just work together to create a large space (which is ripe for the taking, since noone is defending against us!) and **then** decide on a big logo+text.
**ORANGE WESTWARDS!**
@_date: 2017-04-02 16:54:42
[Master plan]( step 1 accomplished: Repel Italy.
Now it is time for step 2,  **TOTAL ORANGE** into the west, starting with the filthy fiat $ sign and its creator, the USA.

Bitcoin doesn't surrender. Bitcoin hodls.
@_date: 2017-04-03 07:16:06
Please no, we should just expand the orange to make the whole logo more balanced. It sucks that we are once again wasting resources fighting each other for 0 benefit. That space is really ours, and we should mark it as such.
Monero has a bigger logo than Bitcoin. Just saying.
Edit: I'm now running a script to fight off this invasion. Your giving up of our space has invited other countries to claim it. We should be working for Bitcoin, not other countries or rainbows.
@_date: 2017-04-02 12:32:28
Keep fighting blue with orange, [the French are already tired and looking to negotiate](
Edit: I like the elephant holding Bitcoin. Can we make this a thing?
@_date: 2017-04-03 10:08:01
Their bottom half, to the left of us, used to belong to us before they drew on it.
@_date: 2017-04-02 19:22:35
They are busy fighting the void, we take over the Van Gogh title bar. Win/win.
@_date: 2017-04-02 17:31:38

@_date: 2017-04-02 09:54:07
The Philippines stopped the French advance at the red stripe, we can do the same. France has no way to expand below Bitcoin because there are too many strong players, and Bitcoin can ally with Megaman to defend against the blue stripe. 
As Americans wake up soon, time is in our favor. Keep blue at bay!
@_date: 2017-04-02 16:15:09
Borders to respect: Eiffel Tower, Germany.
1. Fight off Italy until they withdraw
2. Orange everything between Eiffel Tower, Germany.
3. Redraw a big Bitcoin logo with text.
Edit: Do not respect Van Gogh to the south anymore, it is being taken over by r/void (the black expanding thing from its bottom left corner). Take it over in a pre-emptive strike!
@_date: 2017-04-03 09:28:09

Do you care to elaborate? I haven't done much research on Ethereum since I always considered it a distraction, but seeing it at 1/3rd of Bitcoin's market cap makes me want to learn more, and preferably from a Bitcoin core dev rather than ETH pumpers.

Most people bought near the top, in the range from 600-1200. They rapidly or slowly slipped into loss and stayed there for a long time, watching their losses grow, before Bitcoin stabilized and had a new bull run.
