BIP100 is soured by the introduction of a new part of the bitcoin system that is incentivized.
When 1mb is a part of the protocol, it just is.  There is no discussing the matter.
I am leery (as are others) at how "voting" for a blocksize limit is a zero sum game where there is a more profitable/less profitable answer to the question as to what the blocksize limit is at any given point in time to a specific mining actor.
This has the potential to cause imbalance in the ecosystem as extremely large percentages of mining hashes vote a specific direction and push the limit to gain maximum profitability (this can be tiny blocksizes or large and everything in between).
Now, remove BIP100 and just put in a 4 mb cap which doubles every 2 years with a ceiling of 32mb and suddenly there is no discussion about incentives or a risk of service outages due to game theory and mining.
I think the bad taste of BIP100 is the game theory aspect. (and it is no surprise mining operations vote for this BIP since it allows them to potentially make more profit. If we decide on the change based on mining votes, this BIP was a genius move; since of course mining operators would want more power/profit)

This isn't actually correct.
On August 15th a new version of Core (renamed to what you stated) was released **that has the potential to cause a fork**.
There is no fork until 75% of the miners vote "yes" AND an actual block is mined that is greater than 1mb.
If both of these statements = true, then fork

80-120 trees per acre of land (another scarce resource) and it takes about 100 years for full maturity depending on the tree type.
Scarcity and usefulness is what defines price. Move any of those variables and the price will reflect it.

Whats the difference between a Bitcoin and a lawyer?
One has intrinsic value.  The other's intrinsic value is it burns longer than goat shit.

its not a currency crisis.
its a stock crisis.

I wish there was a concrete proposal put forth by the core devs describing what their counter-proposal to 8mb would be with timelines.
Describing the core devs as being generally open to the idea of an increase in blocksize without them addressing it more concretely paints them as either ignorant to the Bitcoin user base or aware of their demands but not caring about them.

you cannot even get to the point where you start evaluating the money properties of bitcoin if it is worthless.
if bitcoin has no price, it has no value.
with all the faults of any other money, if it is scarce it is more valuable OR if it is run by a government that can force people to use a currency - that is valuable too.
Bitcoins wonderful money properties are worthless if bitcoin's value is zero because its upper limit is infinity.  0xanything=zero

Its not a dollar crisis.
You will know when it is.  Bail ins.  Runaway inflation.  China no longer buying US bonds (world stop buying).
When soverigns (china, japan, UK) buy US bonds, they are saying "I am not confident in my own currency, I want my savings to be in dollars"
You will know when a dollar crisis hits.
edit:  and I will shout it from the rooftops

You can make money any way you want.
The money you are envisioning will be worth a lot less (if anything at ll)
We already have money that you are describing, alt coins (dogecoin).  thats worth maybe a penny.

If there was no limit to the amount of bitcoin created, world of warcraft gold would be worth more and be more useful.
Bitcoin is priced what it is because of its scarcity, not in spite of it.
remember the order:  it is scarce -&gt; it gets a price -&gt; it becomes useful because of its price

thats sacrilege buddy.
Not gonna happen.
If someone wanted this they would have more success creating an alt coin with the new algo and keep in mind, it is nearly impossible to create a new, viable alt coin with an actual dollar price.

Your statement is pretty ridiculous (scarcity being a boolean variable)
Scarcity is subjective but you always compare an items scarcity with competing forms of that thing.
How scarce is Bitcoin compared to gold compared to US dollars compared ..
It seems you arent attempting to acquire knowledge about this subject, only to try and prove some kind of point I dont quite get.  SO wanna reiterate what the hell your trying to prove?
If your point is "Hey guys Bitcoin would still be priced st $200 a coin and 500 million in VC investments if we removed the 21 million limit" you would be wrong.

Dogecoin is worth $0.00012761.  And every bit of that price has to do with inflation.

Is there any sign from core developers that they are willing to compromise on a block size increase that may not be 8mb, but some form of increase?

making something worthless, doesn't "help" that something succeed.
imagine this.
you have $100,000 of gold.  you are 55 years old.  saved your whole life for that gold.
a scientist announces the next day they have successfully been able to make gold out of thin air.
are you happy or sad?  is gold suddenly more useful as money now that it is worthless?
