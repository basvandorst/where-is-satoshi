If I were to try to get into mining today, what is the cheapest but still vaguely profitable way. Basically, what's the minimum outlay that's not a complete waste?
@_date: 2014-10-24 17:58:24
That's your problem with statistics, I can't be arsed to read the article, but without knowing the sample it's meaningless. In my house 33% of people haven't heard of bitcoin, but 33% also can't crawl or feed themselves yet, or for that matter tell me whether she's heard of bitcoin...
@_date: 2014-10-24 15:06:55
I was about to say the same thing. I bet 40% of Americans have never heard of Lithuania.

Wouldn't we all. I've got 0.003 or something, give me 2 of yours and I'll gamble it up.

Why couldn't the blacklisted address just shift their coins to other addresses?
@_date: 2014-05-14 14:36:42
I was going to ask much the same thing, as far as I can see there's no reliable faucets like the other currencies, unless that's because BTC is so 'big'?

I don't really understand bitcoin, but I'm getting there...
@_date: 2014-12-16 08:42:54
That's far more than one paragraph. Where's my prize?
@_date: 2014-05-15 15:43:33
The major difference we have over there is that as I see it, at the moment, it's still easy to be relaxed about it and we *have* to be free and considerate (and even profligate) with the coins we have so that the system gains traction. 
Bitcoin has 4 years plus on dogecoin, it's had a chance to get established and normal people in the real world have heard of it, so it's 'real', we're still trying to get doge established as a thing and have to keep being massively active, keep dicking about, keep trying to get publicity. It's tough being a younger sibling.
I could be wrong, it might not be that. 
@_date: 2014-12-10 13:57:59
If you went to a bank and swapped dollars for yen, you wouldn't get the same price as Google says the exchange rate is. People selling things take a cut to make a profit.
@_date: 2014-06-03 12:50:45
Presumably all the improvements in mining hardware, chips, design etc will feed back into 'normal' computers at some point? If so, these groups must be right at the very edge of technology, that's got to be good, right?

It can, but it won't. Bitcoin (and to an extent the other cryptos) compliment 'real' money. It doesn't need to be a fight, each has its own place.

That's comparing apples and oranges, Facebook and bitcoin are completely different things aren't they? Facebook allows my mum to look at photos of my child doing hilarious things, bitcoin allows me to buy things. Or have I missed the point?

The tipbot has an amount of doge, you can add to it to use on reddit, or withdraw to your phone/pc/paper wallet. It appears to be stuck at the moment, when it comes back, there's a really good help guide.

It's not necessarily the best way, but buy a load of doge (weselldoges.com) or dark (weselldark.com) with PayPal, hold on a bit until the exchange rate is a bit better, then exchange directly (e.g. shapeshift.io)?
@_date: 2014-07-11 15:19:21
Likewise, it would mean I had about £5 worth instead of £2.50...

Is it because it's relatively new to bitcoin? Dogecoin's whole thing is tipping and there's resistance to that too.
@_date: 2014-09-19 17:54:54
Have you tried via other coins? Ok, you'll get stiffed on fees, but you can easily but dark and doge with PayPal, then convert on, say, allcoins.com. bingo!

This is the first time I've been tipped. How do I 'claim' it?
@_date: 2014-06-19 08:36:27
You seem to be getting down voted, but you're probably right. Bitcoiners are buying their heads in the sand.

Is it just that the uptake of the idea of tipping is taking a while to gain traction with bitcoin? Even in the tip heavy dogecoin world you still get tips ignored/rejected.

These 'X% of people have heard of something and only Y% use it' surveys are great in theory, but substitute 'bitcoin' for 'Game of Thrones' or 'paclitaxel' or 'courgettes' and you'd still probably get the same response. Good for click through, but do they really say anything?
@_date: 2015-04-01 10:33:37
It's hardly cheap, and you'd never mine back the coins pay for it.

Just out of interest, if you plugged it in and set it running, what would it actually earn in btc?
@_date: 2015-03-30 09:45:57
Not particularly easily. You *can* by dark/doge with PayPal (weselldoges.com / weselldark.com) at a markup then trade (or use shapeshift.io), which will get you some more easily (but not necessarily as cheaply) than signing up to a trading platform.

At the moment bitcoin is so new that even accepting it is a step in the right direction. Maybe see if local news outlets would be interested an doing a story, good advertising for both you and btc.

@_date: 2015-02-10 11:08:45
That doesn't really say much, basically it's a lot (200,000+ is a lot of anything) of addresses holding approximately 60 coins each, the real interest would be the top, say, 20 holdings.
