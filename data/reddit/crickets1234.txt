your comment is idiotic. These are actual children fighting over play money. stop being an idiot! This war is killing the legitimacy of crypto.

I think bitcoin isn't going anywhere? huh?
@_date: 2018-05-07 15:21:24
Yes. Your comment is the worst thing you have ever seen.

waste of breath bro! let it go. it doesnt help anything to turn the crypto space into what you are turning it into. let the coins gain and lose. Let the communities rise and fall. Let it all happen. To do what you do is to turn the entire space into a kids zone. People feel it. It changes perceptions. Let it go!

its like y'all have nothing better to do. BCH &amp; BTC are not going anywhere. This guy can sue, they can increase the block size, we can make memes and post on reddit until the end of civilization. What a god damn waste of time and effort. If you put half the effort into shilling your coin as you do trashsing the others, we would already be at a .5 trillion cap. Instead, you keep crypto an immature game for children to make memes. Man, you guys are the reason crypto isn't legitimized yet. It just immature and Im sorry for this community. Grow up! you're killing crypto in the name of bitcoin. fucking stupid!!! y'all have no respect for the tech.

Literally anyone who gives a fuck is an idiot. Let it go my man. Put money into any coin you want and stop turning this industry into a teenagers wet dream

OK, so answer me this smarty pants. Why will 2018 or 2019 be the downfall of bitcoin?Why not 2010-11-12-13-14-15-16 or 17? What makes it that now this is a scam and it wasn't before? Why is this a failed experiment now? How did the price/volume increase unbelievably until now? Did Bitcoin have any value BEFORE your peers on wall street woke up to it? Just curious as to your opinion. It seem like you are saying that this will fail because your peers took advantage of it. what if they do and then give up and then the market bounces back because there are people who want it to succeed? Do your peers have enough money to "fight off" every dollar in the world. Isn't that a possibility? How can you KNOW tthis?

I have a bachelors degree in economics. It is completely useless when it comes to crypto.
@_date: 2018-04-08 00:05:46
i remember when the price of coins was rising so fast that i had the FOMO and bought a ton.
