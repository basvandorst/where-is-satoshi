all4btc just like bitspend, b/c they are centric instead of P2P will be eventually shut down. 
regulatory wise - the only way to do it is P2P - just like BTC ;)

again, very helpful comment

you know you can buy anything anywhere with your Bitcoin

i dont think u know how a ponzi scheme work
or how bitcoin works...

i don't think they can make it illegal - look how well it worked with torrents :P
and they always want control - but they can have less. 
but we want it mainstream - i want my mom to pay with bitcoin at the supermarket instead of paying the credit card companies

can u try again? i uploaded the pages just i case and works for me
and will make it all https as soon as it shows some income.
they would not approve a free SLL certificate b/c there are payments in the site

i've built a prototype ATM over a weekend
see any demand for releasing it as open source?
@_date: 2013-10-12 05:43:29
there was a problem with the list - it's there now
absolutely welcome :)

ok, i apologize for the sarcasm if it was offensive
i requested ideas re the content as addition to what i already have (wisdom of the crowds and all that)
as i also mentioned - the lecture is not in English, nor is the presentation
also - when i write here i'm not mindful at all to writing proper language
@_date: 2013-12-31 11:57:09
i'm not trying to sell them that bitcoin is awesome 
(i'm also not the first lecture so they will have a position either way)
but rather to make them understand where we are and whats missing.
regulation, safety, usability and so on

to the authorities or end users? banks are going to lose some money, and authorities lose some control. but the 99% are only going to profit from it so they will be easier to convince no?
@_date: 2013-10-11 20:49:22
that would be great :)
