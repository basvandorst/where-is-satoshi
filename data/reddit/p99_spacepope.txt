The best advice in my opinion is to buy a little each week. Its called cost average buying and its a risk reduction tactic. Over time you will leverage yourself into a larger and larger financial position. Most people who have made lots of money in Bitcoin have been Hodling for years. IMO a small to reasonable investment staring today will look reallynice in a few years.
Set up an automated buy in btc, buy a hardware wallet and move funds to it every few months. Other than that just backup your seed and wallet pin and forget about it. Live life and the next time btc makes headlines for crossing  100k or w/e you should have a nice nest egg. Even if BTC goes to 0 you could have just wasted that money on cigarettes or energy drinks. Only buy what ypu can afford and you can maximize the risk / reward ratio in your favor.

Im not sure what would be more impressive about 1tb blocks.
1. The ability to download and process them in 10min.
2. The ammount of space required to store the whole block chain at 5.2 petabytes per year of bloat.

Yes, buy back into the systems of control that rob you of your right to control you own financial future. I lived through 2008 and I'll never forget the crimes that were commited by the banks and the elected representatives in washington.
Take control. In Bitcoin nobody can give you negative interest rates, nobody can quantitatively ease away your savings and nobody can sell you a an asset or security thats already been bought by someone else. In Bitcoin there is no counter party risk.
That's why Bitcoin is valuable. You literally can't have that level of control outside of Bitcoin and more generally crypto. Furthermore that property isnt tied to some arbitrary price. If they were worth $10 next year i would still buy them because they empower their owner to have control over his own financial future.
Your advice is awful and just because there are some opportunists trying to make a buck on this does NOT mean that there is not real innovation and substace here. There are many true believers like me and when you sell your coins we will be there to buy them up.

The bigger the liquidity pool the smaller wave each whale will be able to make. BTC is tiny in terms of. total market cap and its distribution is distinctly unequal. Both of those things contribute to this. Once the futures markets mature and wall street is able to buy in then this problems will be less noticable.

Oh sure, actually hardware wallets are easier and more secure than most other methods. Just buy a trezor or a ledger and make sure to follow their directions on their website exactly when it arrives and you will be fine.
The biggest thing is to make copies of backup seeds and pins but the same is true of any crypto wallet.
Coinbase is fine for the moment, if you buy a ledger it may take a few months to come in and with transaction fees atm you may want to wait anyway to lose less in fees. However, do yourself a favor and learn from the mistakes of the past instead of repeating them. Any long time Bitcoiner will tell you the same thing, its not safe to keep your crypto on an exchange even a reputable one like Coinbase. Buy a hardware wallet, dont be lazy. This is how people lose what ends up being huge amounts of money to situations outside of their control. Centralized points like a bitcoin bank are a target for hackers and scumbags. If you dont have control over the private keys its not really your Bitcoin.

It seems silly to me that you were downvoted for educating people. Over time we will become less likely to see this sort of behavior as the block reward becomes less important than the block fees. I wonder if that will have a long term disadvantage of miners behind the great wall.

Ya, he keeps doubling down on old arguments. The argument is over, everyone went thier sperate ways. Bch cant even fix transaction maleability because its politically impossible to implent segwit.

Yeah, I agree but i think you need free and open debate to reach concensus, whatever that means. Im sure there has been manipulation of the debate on both sides but censorship ia the wrong way to go about dealing ling with it.

@_date: 2017-08-09 07:38:51
Right , i get it, you are so smart, I am so dumb. You really got me. 
You will have to excuse me, as unlike you, I dont know everything. The only version bits used to signal in bitcoin are used by miners to signal support for different BIPs. Assuming that you know how to read and that I was talking about bitcoin user concensus, you seem to imply that there is version signaling in the node software as well. I guess that would make sense for something like that to exist. 
Please tell me how an average user of a SPV wallet such as ellectrum would signal or how you would account for the fact that most users are just running core software and not paying attention to issues that require concensus. Is it fair to attribute their support to one side or the other?
But lets not kid each other, my comment was about censorship and you are here to try and mock me.

Lots of comments in this thread i find very distasteful. This guy lived in a small room for 7 years and is now facing trial in a country he isnt a citizen of for laws he is not subect to. He has been the subject of extra judicial punishment from the financial sector, has obviously been falsely accused of crimes in an attempt to get extradition to the US, has had presedential candidates threaten his life by threatening to drop bombs on him and has been under 24/7 surveillance for years on end. Why? All for publishing fucking evidence of war crimes commited by the Imperial states of America. This man has suffered for telling the truth and that act commands my respect and admiration.
@_date: 2019-04-11 13:09:33
Its because your implication that everyone in the world is subject to US laws as long as they can be kidnapped  is too silly to dignify a response. Might doesnt make right and an unjust law isnt morally binding. 
My point is that people should take a step back and look at what they are saying when they call for this mans blood.
@_date: 2019-04-11 12:56:46

iirc there is a whole ltb episode about it where andreas explains why he doesnt reddit anymore.
Now that the splut has happened and there are 2 coins its more straight forward. For a long time the mods here suppressed discussions surrounding the scaling debate.
On chain scaling is stupid and bcash is full of frauds and I think saying that its an intentional scam to confuse people about what bitcoin is is accurate. However, this sub isnt a paragon of virtue or whatever, they 100% employed censorship to try and control the outcome by controlling the debate.
That being said reading makes me want to scratch my eyeballs out with fucking rusty nails its so dumb. I hate twitter and this is a decent place to aggregate news and informarion. With all things you should just excercise caution and choose not to blindly trust because everyone has a fucking agenda in this space.

The Block Digest stuff is some of the best bitcoin news, opinion etc available on YouTube. Most people in the space dont know what the fuck they are talking about and are just presenting themselves as experts.

However, I think its wonderful.

It was from 2015. Back then we had a huge problem with buttcoin trolls ruining the sub. This is before ver bought and there was nothing but people making fun of us because the price was still bottoming out from the MtGox collapse. This is also from around the time that hern and andreesen were pushing the XT stuff.
There is a good episode of ltb  that has an interview with a moderator from It probably would give some decent context to what was happening at the time.
