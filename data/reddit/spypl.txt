Ive been reading this reddit for a year and what I inserstood that most of those people have just a little knowledge about economics and even less bitcoins in their wallet.

Interesting, any tutorials online how to setup double spend automatically? 5000 bits @_date: 2015-06-06 22:57:29
Yeah but need to purchase a plan, which is imho quite expensive to pay 90 usd only to receive a text message once a year ;)

Oh please, do you expect no one will use currency? Impossible, bitcoin might be like email, but will never replace currency.

Youre wrong dude. Did you ever go to china? Tor is blocked here, you can access IF you have good vpn because many are blocked also. Moreover, many ports are blocked. People cant send directly to btcchina account money to fund account but must use vouchers or go to office. In poland new bank accounts using btc sre closely watched or banned temporarily for fraud prevention.

IMHO, you should use both. Give % discount for customers using bitcoin, but remember most people would use CC or maybe payment gateway (eu, like SOFORT, PayU).

Really? Just use prepaid card / skrill prepaid etc.

Doesn't it just mean that business in Puerto Rico is not profitable and since not too many people send money via PP, even less will be using bitcoin? BTW. I didn't know puertoricans are so tech advanced to use btc )
@_date: 2015-09-05 06:55:46
Really? What's so "great" :D? How much did you donatE?
@_date: 2015-09-07 08:41:05
They make money for making business, pay developers, cashback protection etc  if you think it is so simple, start your own business and make money for nothing too.
@_date: 2015-09-07 08:45:53
Really? So lets check how many users pay with bitcoin on gyft and other shops and how many cash they make on CC users
