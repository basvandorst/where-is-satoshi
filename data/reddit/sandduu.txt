The main goal of r/personalfinance is to come up with solutions that are as less risky as possible. Bitcoin definitely isn't a low risk solution especially for those who are in debt. These threads need to stop.

Millennials are ruining fiat!

Since they have the machine, they can use their own fiat money to buy bitcoin over and over again. Insert money into the machine, buy bitcoin, get your money back and repeat the process.

Bitcoin cash, damn that's scary

Similar thing happens every time when it breaks a new milestone. There's always a slight drop until everyone 'gets used to' the new price. Since it's the third time to break $6000, from now on the price will be at least $6000 and headed towards $7000, at least I hope it's going to be that way. I expect 7K by November 15th.

I got it. I was checking the wrong address. The address I was checking is the one that I didn't use yet, and the wallet shows that one first. I just checked the addresses for each transaction and that's where my bitcoins are, everything is here. Thank you.

It's time to hodl.

I believe it won't go under $6000 anymore, not for so long at least. It's the third time to pass $6,000 and it's going to stay above it.
