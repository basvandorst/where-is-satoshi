It's a global ledger system that is unlikely to be cheated or unfairly influenced by a single person or group of people and can be used (almost) anonymously.

The counter argument is that there are huge network effects impeding a switch to new crypto currencies.  A new version of Linux is evaluated on its own... it doesn't matter if there are 5 other people using it or 5 million.  If it is better than what the customer is currently using, he is likely to switch.  This is not true with a new crypto-currency.  Even if it is better, a user will not switch if there are only 5 people on the new currency.  
A good comparison is Craigslist.  Everyone agrees that it is outdated and there are numerous sites that offer better features and a better user experience.  But Craigslist still dominates because it's still what everyone else uses... and when you are trying to rent an apartment or sell a bike, getting the most views is more important than the quality of the site itself.
So yeah, you may be right that bitcoin is flawed.  But it may succeed anyway just because it was the first to get a decent sized network and you will never get enough people to switch to a new crypto-currency.

The difference is the copy of a bitcoin key gives the owner control over something that is unique and can't be duplicated.  This is not true of cracking MS Office.  If you copy my bitcoin key and steal my bitcoin, I own 1 less bitcoin.  If you copy a MS Office key, Microsoft still owns the same number of copies of MS Office.  You need to think of bitcoin as more like a physical object and less like existing software that you are used to.

A year's salary for rent, health insurance, food.  possibly also for another programmer or two.  Maybe you will be comfortable using a bitcoin service run by people in their spare time, but I'd prefer one with several people working full time and being paid for it.

[Here]( is a good graph of the recent trend showing the total bitcoin network output and recent difficulty increases.  I was hoping the average output had peaked (and so difficulty would stay the same) but we blew through that max yesterday.  [Another good page]( that is predicting that the difficulty will go up about 10% on Aug 1st.  So those are somewhat useful to see where difficulty has been and may go.

Someone on Bitcointalk says that they wrote Dwolla an email explaining their problems with this.  Dwolla called and verified existing info over the phone and that was good enough.

I was thinking the same thing. Personal stories will be better marketing.  Also, the realistic truth is that right now for most Americans and others in developed countries, there isn't a compelling use-case for Bitcoin. However, providing examples of people who *are* facing problems that are solved by Bitcoin will get the viewer thinking about those issues. 
I like your first two vignettes.  For the third one, I would take out the programming aspect of it and just have a charity that uses Paypal and has a sudden increase in transactions (maybe selling tickets for an event) and Paypal sees it as suspicious and freezes their account.  The charity rep talks about how unhelpful Paypal customer service is and how they need the money to pay their bills but they have no idea when they will regain access to those funds.

I'm pretty sure we were jinxed by the "Bitcoin is near perfect money" headline from a few hours ago.

Agreed. It sounds like the larger block size was not tested on versions before 0.8 - which is a pretty big oversight.

Looking at their order page, there's very little liquidity there for BTC/EUR.  Right now a market order to sell about 10 BTC would go all the way down to 60 EUR to fill the order and about 20 BTC total would get you close to 1 EUR.   So an order to sell 160 BTC at 1 EUR would have taken out all the buy orders down to 1.  This wouldn't happen at MtGox because there would be plenty of buy orders right near the market price.
