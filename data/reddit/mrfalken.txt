What about this?:
I was about to send some coins to the crowdsale because I like a lot this project but that comment stop me. 
Yeah I know... I should check for myself with a software like Wireshark or something similar but if there really is no outgoing traffic I'm afraid their Metadisk nodes are fake..

I really need an explanation :/

I switched to Electrum a few months ago and I'm super happy. 
Most of my coins are now in encrypted paperwallets (I have backups in several places) and a spendeble small amount is in a offline machine with Electrum. 
Now I can sleep at night ;)

The guy asked me about this thing and I had no idea. In the end we agreed to use a "traditional" escrow.
But anyway... I look forward to your answer cause a lot of people use that web wallet and it can be useful in future transactions.
And congrats for this service I thing is really great..
Thank you.

Sorry for the off topic:
I read you are the developer behind Bitrated. I have a costumer that wants to use Blockchain.info to pay an address generated by Bitrated. Do know you if Blockchain.info supports this system?

Hi Marion_Biscuit.
I have Casascius coins if you still interested. I'm in Europe (Barcelona) and I sent them by registered mail that includes tracking number. 
Take a look at my album:

Withdraw cash without a credit card is provided by the Hal-Cash network. I believe it's also working in Poland but their website shows more countries although probably they are not working yet. 
@_date: 2015-03-09 15:09:19
AFAIK there are two other startups in Spain offering the same service through the HalCash system:

Here's a video how the HalCash system works:

Yeah, that's what I thought while I was watching the video, but then looking at their [webpage]( I found a link to an appcoin.
So OP, is this appcoin required with this system?
Anyway,  all these new ways of decentralization sound very very  interesting.

Oh, great! I did a SEPA withdrawal this weekend on BTC-E (I sold there 5 BTC) and I'm still waiting...
This has been my first time converting Bitcoins to FIAT and it looks really bad, wonderful :/
@_date: 2013-03-24 17:21:11
I'm from Spain. 
Those spikes has nothing to do with all the Cyprus mess but with the spanish digital media. 
On January 30, a Bitcoin article was frontpage of meneame.net, that is the most visited webpage in Spain (it is some kind of reddit).
 
And the second increment of visitors on March 17, corresponds with an article in the digital edition of "El Mundo", one of the biggest spanish newspapers.
So that's it, the general public is still ignorant about what Bitcoin is.
@_date: 2013-03-16 13:15:35
I don't know how. Apparently they are just block all the accounts, according to a Cypriote guy comment in Also, localbitcoins.com doesn't show anyone trading with coins in Cyprus. I guess the only they can do is to travel to their neighbours countries and buy it to someone.
