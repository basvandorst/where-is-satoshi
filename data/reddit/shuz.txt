You can actually just leave the society into which you are paying taxes. No one is coercing you to stay within some government's borders or power structure. Just go homestead the Alaskan wilderness or the Yukon. You'll be mostly self sufficient so you'd probably make too little money to pay taxes.

Then why did we feel the need to pass anti-trust laws against monopolies a century ago before many or our regulations existed?

In theory this is possible. Also in theory I could form a space colony. In theory, many things are possible. However, if we look at history, there is a reason that we have established anti-trust legislation: because monopolies left unchecked gained too much power within the free market that the market was losing its "free"ness. I know, it sounds like a paradox, but sometimes too much of something, be it regulation or unregulated capitalism, is actually bad.

But we're not talking a website or streaming service, but an actual physical network that must be built and maintained.  It would take years of work and tonnes of capital to break into an already established monopolized utility market like internet.

Not for all industries. I can't get four of my friends together and start a(n) {oil refinery, chip fab, steel mill, smelting company} to compete against a hypothetical 80% market share monopoly that benefits from economies of scale and contract muscle. 
The issue of any economy is how to prevent both non-competitive monopolies and regulatory capture.

Imagine you are on a boat with 10 people. You have to do chores, maintain the ship, and decide where to sail next. Imagine if 9 of you are OK with a decision and 1 isn't: should that person have veto power? Should that 1 person be exempt from cleaning and ship maintenance because it isn't part of THEIR social contract they want to sign? Should that person be exempt from doing their fair duty bc it's not part of their social contract, or should they find a different boat when they reach their next port?
