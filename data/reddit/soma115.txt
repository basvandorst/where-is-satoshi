And yet California is one the richest States. What I'm pointing out is - there is more DD in California than in any other states. But there is not enough DD to show it's full potential. 
Another place with lots of referendums is Australia.
It is not a matter of intelligence actually. It is about 4 ways of spending money:

If I was Satoshi, I would work on introducing swiss style semidirect democracy. This is the next big step in the development of civilization.

Thanks mate. Appreciate.
@_date: 2018-05-20 19:01:21
California have over 30 million and lots of referendums - just not as powerful as in Switzerland, which is the problem.
Switzerland didn't have any education when they introduced referendums.
Actually every time when some city/country trying to use DD it works fine. For example Porto Alegre. 
Trusting that some politicians will decide in your favor without your consent is borderline madness.

I'm using it for about 2 years. Working great.
It was last Polish exchange that moved abroad. Current ruling party (PIS) doesn't like this kind of innovation. They also killed social lending in Poland.

Indirect democracy is not fair. It can't be used as benchmark to measure direct democracy. If you would like to know how DD work in reality - take a look at Switzerland. They have GDP per capita higher than USA. And they are just like any other people in the rest of the world - equally stupid as any other country. They just have better rules.

What was major arguments against this law?
@_date: 2018-06-15 08:51:08
Actually, if people would decide about war - there will be no wars. Take a look at Switzerland. They have unique system in witch citizens maintain control over every decision of government. GDP per capita in Switzerland is higher than in USA. Faith of all citizens is too important to be left in hands of politicians.

Ok, cool. But such voting system will not be used if citizens have no right for referendum in first place. Don't get me wrong - it is great you are working on this. Just first thing to do is actually give people right to vote on issues.
If you insist to make progress in that matter - please let me know. I have some ideas.
@_date: 2018-06-14 14:34:12
People will not be informed if they can't decide how schools, press and government work. So what is first? Knowledge or decisions? If knowledge then change will never happen.
@_date: 2018-06-14 22:00:47
But it's true. That's how it works in direct democracy. Once the subject is discussed - it became more popular and understud. Next time will be better.
@_date: 2018-06-14 06:51:34
What do you mean by true democracy? Referendums?

You can also pay taxes in BTC in Zug.

That specific message is much better than 'Bitcoin' by itself. I'm often wonder with whom can use btc but rarely asking.

That is sad true. Also many companies will not want blockchain because it will force them to play be the rules they created. And that means that client sometimes will win. Some companies doesn't want to be honest.

Can delay between planets be used as proof work? Is this delay similar (at some level) to computational difficulty?

What if consequent blocks will have to base on each other? I mean: each pass take in to calculation hashes from previous.

Such society will be easily conquered by small group poorly organized morons. It is because your society is not organized at all. See, in this world wins those who organise better. 
@_date: 2017-04-20 16:42:28
No. People are equal. If we agree about that then we can decide both - that everyone pay taxes - and that nobody pay taxes. But we can't decide that some pay and some don't.
@_date: 2017-04-20 05:41:23
It boils down to question: who states the law. If it is people itself and everybody is equally - then there is a chance for fair laws and taxes.
But if low is stated by oligarchy then we have what we have.
@_date: 2017-04-20 16:48:11
How it is organized? How army works? How you but heavy military equipment? Who is fighting?
@_date: 2017-04-20 17:58:13
The goal of every company in the world is to sell you worst possible product for highest possible price. It can work worse than government. Oligopoly is much more profitable than competition. It happened before many times (medieval Italy, early stages of industrial revolution).
It will not work mate. And even if it will - then it will look like Somalia or Kowloon - so not really great place to live. Therefore it will be prone to be conquered. 
We need taxes and referendums in order to **protect** our freedom. Law will exist in your system too (it is a matter of profit if somebody will want to go to judge). Only choice we have is how we will state law - by chance and good will, be elected government or by referendum.

Thank you for explaining. That made me think.

Then let's vote not to pay taxes. But are you sure you want that?
@_date: 2017-04-20 05:35:01
How about we vote?

Let's create it then. I feel you need some r/wholesomememes friend.

No. That's the problem.

How about we agree to pay taxes, catch pedofiles by detective work and keep our privacy?
No? Then this is dictatorship.

Yeah, me too but I'm afraid that it will not happen without action on our site. 
(BTW. I'm very enthusiastic about swiss style semi direct democracy)
@_date: 2017-04-20 17:22:26
I do. If there is no need to buy something for everybody, if there is some other source of profit - there is no need for taxes. I've heard about some village in Switzerland in which community gain profits from renting some real estate. They are so successful that they don't pay local taxes at all (altough they do pay cantonal and federal taxes).
Anyway - it should be app to society itself if they should pay and how much. AFAIK - majority want to have some public infrastructure like courts, schools, etc. but not to much.
@_date: 2017-04-20 15:01:09
Ok, so judges, police and army should be privately owned, right? Is this youre idea?
@_date: 2017-04-20 14:56:16
Of course. But they will have to have separated district. Confederation is immanent part of direct democracy.
@_date: 2017-04-20 16:52:00
Can you show me some practical use of this theory?
@_date: 2018-03-23 07:28:21
You need to load it twice. But yeah, it is faulty mechanism.
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:58:04
Well, yeah - even if we don't need any. 
I'm not eager to leave UE though. But inefficiency there is huge.
@_date: 2017-10-21 06:31:25
Yeah, totally. Imho what's important is that it is a matter of 'if btc survive'. Because if it will - that price WILL be achieved no matter what.
@_date: 2017-10-21 06:00:58
If you assume that btc will be 100% successful and substitute all cash (M1 money) then 1btc will be worth $150 000 000 000
@_date: 2017-10-10 12:45:05
You are absolutely right. However, people use to measure this with referendum. I know, just saying.
