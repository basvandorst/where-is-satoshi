How can I exchange Bitcoins for cash if I don't have a bank account?

The way I see it is that they have a point but they never get it across in a way that makes it seem sensible.

I did mention that although it was trolling at first, over time the SA goons have faded away to the point where it's legitimate SJ warriors.

I agree- want to know how to get people not to make a big deal about women in technology? Don't make a big deal about it yourself.

There's also [BitVegas]( - it's essentially an in-game casino that uses Bitcoins as currency. You get 0.5 mBTC every fifteen minutes just for playing, and it's pretty fun too.

Not much teenagers or women at that.
For what it's worth, I'm a 14 year-old girl who uses bitcoin for business purposes- there are too many restrictions on alternative currency sources for minors, since bank accounts have to be linked to a guardian's and most money transfer services are adults only.

Also, gold is basically useless outside of Reddit. Since btc can be redeemable outside for goods and services, tipping btc can be a lot more useful to someone who's hurting on cash.

is a sub with a supposed purpose of pointing out offensive comments about race, gender, that sort of thing- in reality, it's a project that was originally created by SomethingAwful goons to basically troll reddit.
Since then, however, most of the goons have been banned or otherwise removed, and it is populated by legitimate SJ warrior white knights who will vote brigade threads and post angry comments if they catch a whiff of something offensive.
