Ad Hominem. 
BTC to BTC is something that works for you and your contacts.  Fiat to fiat has value, and will continue to have value to people who don't live in a bitcoin economy.   Right now most of us can't pay rent, or buy groceries, pay bribes, or post bail in bitcoin.  As long as cash exists then there will be demand for a cash to cash wire service. I'm just saying to call Western Union completely outclassed and e.g. buggy to car is not accurate, they both have advantages over the other.

Well a 15-18 year old car is nearly fully depreciated.  He's probably going to lose a couple hundred dollars over his ownership.  There is an enthusiast market for these cars, and OP hopefully knows what to buy and sell it for. 
Also, Bitcoin is a speculative investment.  It's making gains now, but past performance does not guarantee future results.

From 10 facts about capital gains from IRS.gov
1) Almost everything you own and use for personal purposes, pleasure or investment is a capital asset.
2) When you sell a capital asset, the difference between the amount you sell it for and your basis – which is usually what you paid for it – is a capital gain or a capital loss. 
3) You must report all capital gains.

try transferring a large sum of money to a different country, different currency.  
I understand that BTC offers a huge advantage over Western Union, but getting the Western Union customers over to BTC isn't mass adoption.   Also, I'm not sure I can convince Grandma to use an exhange in Slovenia, but an exchange in the USA is an easier sell, which is why I pulled coinbase numbers.  I'm talking about trying to get the average guy into this as a currency, not a store of value.

Bitcoin is valuable because of the protocol and functionality (the protocol is 15% less valuable than yesterday)

Let call like the vendors and gas stations do, show the "list price" of $1030 with a cash discount bringing it down to $1000.  End of the day it's a 3% premium.

I'm talking about adoption and what can drive that, and you're already in a world where BTC is the dominant currency.   How did you get there if no one uses it?

Also divest in any S&amp;P 500 index fund you have since AAPL will be the  holding.

So I just put money in, wait for my guaranteed appreciation of assets, and they buy my product in a couple weeks.  In that scenerio where I'm guaranteed appreciation, why would I spend BTC when I could instead use my weakening fiat and get it out of my pocket as fast as possible.  Now no BTC is sloshing around the marketplace, which seems like an essential part of adoption.
In a future world where the value of BTC is stabilized, then what's the advantage as a buyer?

It's my understanding that there are transaction fees bundled into the protocol, and I imagine those fees rising as mining rewards diminish.  I may not understand the fees totally though.  
Also just to clarify, the fee was 0.021 (so like 1/15 that of a credit card fee).  The vendor says this about the bitcoin fee, not sure if it is BS or not..."the processing fees are charged by the processing company used to process the transaction. We do not keep any of the processing fees or make any money off of them as the go directly to the processing company"

Western Union: 160 year old business with 500,000 locations in over 200 countries ready to dispense local currency seconds after it's sent.
Bitcoin: 5 year old experiment that lets you send and receive claim to an address that someone else may value at x dollars.  
You can argue about the fees all you want, but Western Union is no horse buggy, and Bitcoin is no car.

"BTC earned $1000 of interest"  LOL
Did you possibly incur fees because you were past or nearing the six transfers LIMIT per statement cycle that applies to ALL banking institutions (Credit Unions included).   Make a transfer in person and you can do it as many times as you want.

So you took a picture of your website and submitted it as a .png.  Why?
@_date: 2014-01-03 22:04:32
Thanks, my math was a little off.  I was also factoring in the difference between the buy price on coinbase and the bitpay exchange rate.   When I calculated this morning there was a .003% spread between the buy price on coinbase and bitpay who would process the payment.   That spread might change up or down or end up in your favor even.
Should have been $1000 * 1.00321 * 1.01 +.15 = $1013.39

e9 is the bird, future BTC growth is "two in the bush".  You know what they say.
Sounds like you have been hunting for this rare animal for a while.  If you have the money to buy it and it doesn't go to market very often then go for it.  
Also the car has insurance if it crashes, BTC doesn't
@_date: 2014-01-08 00:55:13
It's a joke.  Whenever BTC is soaring and someone asks "why", will explain that price is because the protocol has value.  So if the protocol/functionality is the basis for value, then it's 15% less valuable then yesterday.

Just went to WU.com and priced out a $1200 transaction from USA to Cambodia.  Costs me $15 to send that amount online.  So about the same as using coinbase to convert fiat to BTC and then send the BTC.  To make no mention of what they do they do with BTC in Cambodia. 
GO ahead and downvote, I'm not joining in this circlejerk.

I can see a Western Union interface sitting on top of a bitcoin protocol. Comfortable  branding for the masses no real savings passed on.

You can go with Amagi Metals.  I believe Kitco has $2500 min orders as well so that may be a hurdle for some.
