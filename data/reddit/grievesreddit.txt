Im sorry but you are jumping from subject to subject please tell me how the energy consumption from bitcoin mining is not a problem. Considering the usage today is a fraction of that it would be if were to be widely accepted as a currency and used throughout the world

Please explain to me then, i am not all knowing and i acknowledge that. 
I don't understand what the mining of gold has to do with the energy usage of current fiat currencies considering the vast majority of currencies are no longer backed by gold and haven't been for a while.

No to be completely honest i dont but again that is beside the point. you have no idea what your talking about

Sorry but no currency is still back by gold, and half of the argument is about the cost of mining gold.
Bitcoin clearly has a problem with the energy consumption, any anyone who tries to deny this is blind. Bitcoin for the most part is barely used as a currency at the moment, imagine the whole world running on bitcoin the billions of transactions a day compared to what is happening today .
This is not to say it cant be solved anything can be solved and with the better and better renewable energy sources this may not be such a huge problem in the future, but for now it sure is alarming

The only similarity is that they both have been chosen at one point in time to be considered a currency
But this has nothing to do with the argument
Edit. Also gold at this point is not used as a currency like it was a long time ago, it is considered an investment by most people, a store of value. If you think bitcoin is used as a store of value or a commodity which most people on this sub seem to think it is then this defeats the whole purpose of the coin because it indicates at some point everyone is going to cash out for fiat currency

So you pay all your bills in BTC?
