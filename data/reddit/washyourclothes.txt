Been adding to this list of crypto subs; [Crypto Trader Network](
Am I missing any subs?

The [network]( is expanding. Needs more subreddits though.

Check it out. Working on a network of subreddits that are strictly trading-specific: [Crypto Trader Network](
Any suggestions? Am I missing any subreddits?

Hello all, a few people and I have been working on a project to link together different communities of crypto traders. Called the [Crypto Trader Network]( (very original, I know..). It has been going well and we're seeing some serious progress/growth. It's similar to the SFWPornNetwork but a lot less rigid, much more informal, and entirely based around creating a resource for traders and bringing together crypto related subreddits. 
I am hoping to gain some support from trading communities such as this one. I'm open to any thoughts/ideas/suggestions/requests/criticism, and I would be grateful for any support that can be given.
