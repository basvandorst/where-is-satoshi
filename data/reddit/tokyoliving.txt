I have been using Coinbase for months. Tried to sign up for Gdax, logged in using Coinbase then I get a pop up saying Gdax is not supported in your state. Looked it up on their site and sure enough not supported. 
Weird as I have been buying for months on CB. Oh well just gotta send my ETH from CB to Binance like I have always been doing.

Actually, any corporation especially the financial industry wants stability as ironic as that sounds. Crypto is in its infancy, flat and traditional stocks still offer that stability. They may wade in, but until it’s been proven otherwise, they will maintain their hold on tradition.

There is no longer an actual utility at this point. Slow and expensive transactions. Far better coins out there now with better functionality. Like everything, BTC was the pioneer but now becoming antiquated at this point. If you think otherwise you are delusional and have not done your research.

Fair points. Bitcoin was the first and gets the most attention. It became what it wasn’t intended to be. Now a e-store of value for better or worse.
There are so many other coins out there some known some unknown that serve better purposes for real change. Those are poised to take off when the overall system catches on to the reality, which is happening little by little. 
I’ll be happy when BTC no longer steals this spotlight from coins that matter and actually have a function and role in the inevitable change.

I’m not young either, age withheld. I will say these old guys do have experience, and may know about finance, but we are all in uncharted territory with this. BTC for example, has confounded even the best of them. 
I would also add it is in the crusty old codgers best interest to speak about cryptocurrency in bad terms so they can continue to maintain the status quo, which is unwinding.

You speak like bitcoin is a real live entity. I would start to pay attention more rather than getting blinded by your loyalty. Now that crypto has hit the mainstream in a big way BTC the most because it was the first and still in the spotlight is getting scrutinized like never before. 
I could be wrong, just blind loyalty is dangerous.

I’m not a part of the BTC community tbh. In fact I only hold a small percentage in my portfolio. Mostly for posterity to say I have some.

We can predict until the cows come home and preach and have faith, but then there's reality and this cannot last another two years. Think internet bubble. And besides if you look at the people buying in thinking they can make a quick buck now or get rich off of BTC, it's quite delusional. Money wigs people out. That train has come and gone for most of us. Sure make some money perhaps if you get lucky. But in the long run, not gonna happen.

What I find interesting is that bitcoin steals the spotlight from every other coin out there. It’s the first and well known amongst the masses. But the days of making massive gains are long gone and yet people still hold on to the possibility. I missed that boat but got in this year. But soon realized there are a number of other potential coins that may pay out over time if you are patient. This making a quick buck mentality is partly driving the BTC craze at the moment. Other factors are at play as well of course. 
Do what you gotta do, but take a look at other coins, read, do your research  and really  know what you are getting into instead of being blinded by the BTC light that shines ever so bright... for now.
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:54:07

It's far too institutionalized now for anyone to lose faith. There are so many cheaper coins with an actual function and so many more in the pipeline. No, BTC was the first, the most memorable with the myths and limelight, but after a while like all things that shine bright, fade away.

CB easy for beginners, and adding just a little skin in the game. After you have learned what you are getting into, investing in and how the game works, get out of CB. 
CB is cashing in on naivety. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:40:08
No worries there are so many other affordable coins with a lot of potential. Maybe not as sexy as BTC, but decent gains nonetheless. And when the public gets on board and cannot afford BTC they will start to invest in other coins. So do your reading and choose wisely.
@_date: 2017-11-19 03:01:35
Go to an exchange if you can’t wait. I bought on Coinbase through my bank and locked in at a dip
But I’m a HODLer so I’m patient.
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:43:01
Right on!
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:47:32
Takes a long time to transfer but you do lock in for better or worse. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:25:48
Indeed surreal is a good way to put it. Imagine seeing the price skyrocket in yen... it’s in the millions �� ¥1,080,000

The most  idiotic write up I’ve ever read. Very American-centric for a world currency. The world does not revolve around the US.
And my wife owns BTC!

Not a good thing actually. When you use a CC on coinbase they charge a lot in fees. You hope the coins you invest make enough to cover that then you might make a profit.

Thank you. I'd like a BASA badge or patch please.

That’s why you don’t leave your coins on an exchange. Especially Coinbase. Get a wallet of some kind to hold your coins. Trezor or ledger nano S. I have a ledger.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:02:56
Look at the chart. Large buys man!
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:56:10
I live here and there not enough merchants using bitcoin as a form of payment yet to warrant any in depth involvement.
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:34:45
Targets set at 6400 and 5000. Wishful thinking I know.

Actually I am in Tokyo and on coincheck and opened an account on coinbase no problem from here without a VPN.  Not sure why you are having that issue unless this is a recent regulation on the part of coinbase.
Japan coincheck you can transfer money from overseas banks, but there is a lag time. I just have my Japanese bank account and credit card here connected. Don’t think you can connect a US bank.

We are leading it. News is it made msm news and 80% of population knows and or uses or has purchased BTC 
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:35:08
Get it now!
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:07:05
too much of a set up for that one...
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:09:28
People and your future telling skills gotta stop. It’s just wrong.
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:06:01
And your point is?
@_date: 2017-11-03 07:39:54
Done and done... thanks for the advice. Also not just in BTC also 4 others. Focus is on BCT for the most part.

coinexchange's Japan app does not have the buy/sell place orders. I can buy and sell with the app. I had to do it on my computer.
I am a runner and yes a good workout with a little stress.

Didn't really paint BC in a good light. But then again it is the US and they are behind the times. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:24:45
I doubt it as well.

Moral of the story HODL
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:19:53
No it's not fair... but life is not fair. And anyone who tells you differently is either delusional or selling you a load of SHITE!
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:18:18
Nahh I never had enough BTC to begin with to make significant gains.
I’m in for the long hodl on a couple of coins. I’m patient. Most want it now.
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:48:34
Get it off coinbase asap. So yes.
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:56:56
Simply yes!
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:44:35
PayPal is expensive!!! Cryptocurrency is the way to go! 
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:00:31
Well it is making it into the mainstream in a big way. This just aired the other day. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 01:03:51
Looks like it
@_date: 2017-10-21 13:54:58
I’m in Japan and incredibly cryptocurrency friendly. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 04:42:05
I use coincheck as well. Easy to set up and trades.
@_date: 2017-10-21 10:16:49
Watch this 
It’ll give you some perspective. Towards the end they talk about regulators and governments.

“Just do it”

Guys like Dimon and buffet have to say these things. These guys are just afraid it will impede upon their wealth.
