Because it creates a barrier.  I'm interested in playing with about $200USD worth of bitcoin, just to see what it is about.  However, my very quick research has show every method available to me to purchase bitcoin is frankly more trouble than it's worth.  
I'm not willing to link a bank account because I'm in the US and the security on that is crap.  Nobody takes paypal.  I could use a credit card, but places have all this KYC/AML crap that could require me to share far more info than I'm comfortable with (as far as most people are concerned, bitcoin exchanes are just random online businesses, and I certainly would not give my social security number to any regular online business).  That leaves person2person type exchanges with all the risks inherent in it, not to mention all the rediculous hoops to jump though (deposit cash at a local branch within 90 minutes, WTF???) 
So, here I am with $200 that is going to stay in my pocket because I cannot purchase bitcoin as easily as I can a toaster.  And that is how the vast majority of potentical users of bitcion will react when they get curious about this.

That they zero out bond holders and other subordinate debt before touching deposits.  But no, they decided to steal deposits to make investors whole instead.
At this point, it's safer to be an investor in a bank than a depositor.  Insane.
