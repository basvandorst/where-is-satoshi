Version 1 looks great.
Its bright, beautiful, gives a quick overview what its about and also provides a link to a wallet in a very clearly arranged way.
The other versions take way more time to navigate around and look quite generic.

I agree.
If they spam the network and are obviously not willing to do anything about it, then we should spam their customer support until this stops.
If 10k customers open one ticket each day, asking to implement segwit/batching, they will surely notice that.
Starting right away.

Dont use Coinbase, they are total trash!
Basically everything is buggy on their system. You cannot even export your transaction history unless you have some EUR funds on there (it says "complete your account").
They acknowledged that this is a known bug, when I raised a support ticket.
That was 4 months ago and it is still not fixed!
I also tried to verify my gf with her own account, but the identity verification is super broken and borderline unusable.
Oh yeah and they dont support Segwit.
There have been rumors that their tech team is somewhat incompetent, which (from my point of view) surely seems to be true.
Stay away from this pile of buggy sh**.
Better use Bitstamp. Transactions are fast, they support EUR/BTC and have Segwit enabled.
Much better choice.

Well, I guess I got lucky. My order went through.
I sold all my BTC at 6350€ (7324$) and bought right back in at 5690€ (6563$).
According to the Bitstamp CEO (thanks to [TheGreatMuffin]( for the link), a "bot went wild".  
Someone lost a sh\*t ton of money with that bot.

Unfortunately Oxymoronny is wrong here.
As already explained with my example of buying ETH, exchanging you BTC into anything else is a taxable event.
Its considered as selling your BTC and buying ETH (or gold or soy sauce or whatever you like).
It is even EXPLICITLY mentioned in this article:

I sure dont want to be in your shoes when the tax office checks your documents.  
Please read this article carefully:

I wish it worked like this.
Unfortunately the tax office could not care less about blockchain addresses or other such details.
There is no legal way around the FIFO. It even counts, if you change your BTC into any other altcoin.  
So if you had change your 1 BTC which you bought less than a year ago for 3000€ into some ETH in December, then you would still need to pay taxes on the price\_in\_December minus 3000€ (the profit).  
Because this counts as "spending" the "good" which you aquired.
And then the counter of one year starts again for the ETH you bought.
Here is a little article explaining the details. Its in German though:

Well, the things detailed in the article are true (I am German myself, holding some BTC).
However, I would not consider this Tax Haven.  
You need to keep in mind that you cannot do any kind of short term trading, otherwise you would have to pay full income tax, which can be as high as 42&amp;
And they will always calculate the taxes based on First-in First-out order.  
So lets say I bouth 1 BTC a year ago for 3000€ and another one a month ago for 7000€.  
In this case, I CANNOT cut my losses by selling the 1 BTC which I bought for 7000 right now for 5800, because tax is always calculated on the first BTC I bought.  
So according to the tax calculations I did not make a loss of 1200€ but rather a profit of 2800€ and would have to pay taxes on that.
That is also the reason why I am still HODLing through those hard times to get over the one year threshold.

Meets stranger with his own booth at the largest consumer electronics show in the world, with access to prototype of new, unreleased device of company, gets free hardware with preloaded firmware that needs to comply with /is checked by software that is downloaded separately from official company website.
Sounds like a solid plan to rek people and totally not overkill.
Thumbs up for reasonable comments...
