Any chance that the $3.2m already raised are the source of the massive buys that have been going on each day?  The fund obviously has to buy slowly and someone has to be buying?  The volume of the big purchases has been about 3k btc at about $70 which is only $210k each day.  I can see some big gains in price coming...

There would still be ways of getting bitcoins through local add websites like localbitcoins, but this would make the protocol far more accessible for those who wish to use the ease and speed of international money transfers using bitcoin and are simply not tech savvy enough to do it for themselves.  There is nothing morally wrong with charging for a service.

I think this is funny, and part of Bitcoin is not taking everything so seriously and doing what the man tells you to do.  In other words I like this idea.

Please don't tell me what to do with my money.  Unless I've missed something I thought that was the whole point?

This is happening to me too, I was just about to post this.  I even created a new account to login with and that didn't work either, so hopefully its a problem with Gox, but not that big a problem...
