Do not sign it. What kind of scam is that? Especially with the whole "the applicant shall bear the legal responsibility for the above information." Debit card providers require to follow KYC and AML policies. Autogenerated details don't follow those and as such are not viable. So no, that isn't normal. In the end, it's up to you what you do, but I would stay the fuck away.

Yeah, but feeling a bit sad over losing what could have made you a shit ton of profit and walking away still doing okay financially is different from perhaps being in debt and losing all your life savings. Of course, in this case you have to think of money as percentages. If a millionaire loses $50,000 they won't be devastated but an average person would.

It's a joke.

I just looked it up, and it indeed is private money, but it's also treated as a form of foreign currency, which is why you don't pay VAT (not sure about this, so I'll leave it in this parenthesis, but I believe it's sort of treated like gold, as a form of pseudo-currency). Hopefully it stays that way.
For anyone curious to read the official documents, here's the UK law on taxation in regards to cryptocurrency: 
And it being private money:

Wise decision. Your few $ **could** be worth millions by 2022.

For me, BitPay was the way to demonstrate the legitimacy of Bitcoin. While I keep my money invested and do not wish to cash out any time soon, just withdrawing some money from the ATM was enough to convince people. It suddenly becomes tangible. Of course, BitPay isn't the only way, I just mean in general buying something (or having physical cash) with the Bitcoin to demonstrate the reality of it.

Hi James, thanks for the response.
I have indeed sent an email, and they replied with: "We have escalated your issue to our cardholder services team (cc’ed here)."

I never understood the point of these posts. They always have the word "could" thrown around with no actual accurate prediction behind it (because nobody, not even the experts can predict where this is all going). I **could** just as easily say something like:
The recent increase in price has shown a major bullish movement towards the previous highs. A steady uptrend is forming that *could* push Bitcoin into the $750,000 prices by the end of 2020. 
What I said is completely baseless bullshit of course, but I mean... It *could* right? Anything is possible really.

You too James. I tried it at the ATM as well, perfectly fine now. Thanks again for the help.

I think it depends on the country. I know the UK for example considers Bitcoin and cryptos in general as "foreign currency" in which case this would result in legal issues. It's different around the world though, so it depends on how they treat Bitcoin where he lives... 
Edit: To be clear, I'm not a lawyer or anything. I just know the law for the UK regarding cryptos. And there's no specific laws that deal with it, just old laws applied to it because it's relevant. So I don't think the hacker would be charged with any specific law regarding cryptocurrency, rather another law that deals with fraud / illegal acquirement of currency.

Don't just say "nope," provide reasoning. My reasoning for "yes" is based on historical evidence. Watch Aantonop on YouTube for some of this info. Bitcoin is still young, it hasn't gone mainstream yet. People have been criticizing it since it was $100. It has been called "dead" about 200 times now in news articles. Disregard any growth before ~2015 and just consider the past 2 years. It was a bear market for so long, we've only had a bull one for 2 years. It isn't slowing down any time soon unless some serious shit happens. Except, considering how universities in Germany are starting to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment for tuition, and that Barclays the bank is looking into offering and accepting Bitcoin... It's safe to say it's not going anywhere for a bit. 
Also, consider the supply. 21,000,000 coins. Satoshi has about 1,000,000. The other billionaires have 200k-300k. It leaves approximately 18 - 19 million for the general public. The difficulty of mining it is much harder now. The supply is finite. As with all things finite, once the supply runs out, the price will go up. Unless an alternative is found. And while that exists, there will still be a huge spike in the price. Of course we won't be mining the rest any time soon, just something to keep in mind.

Indeed. The alts followed along shortly thereafter.

Thank you very much :) Hopefully it's an issue that can be resolved. 
Edit: It works now. Thanks again for you help, I'll be sure to rate the app 5 stars, that's some amazing customer support.

That doesn’t work with your current username. Make a novelty account called like “ExplainsJokes” and you’ll do much better. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:47:07
Sure thing :) 
Make sure to read up on it in your own time as well though just so you have your own understanding of it established; upon which you can base your decisions on whether or not to invest into Bitcoin. Bittrex is giving out BTG for example on the 1:1 basis I mentioned.

Since I'm here, let me just link an amazing YouTube channel managed by a dude who is practically an expert in cryptocurrency.
The video above explains hard forks perfectly. His other videos are extremely helpful as well.

To be fair, you need to have a really high IQ to be able to fold yourself more than 6 times.

Well, that could have haunted you forever but I'm glad the daredevil inside you came through :)

Ah in that case they are just increasing the volume of transactions that can be stored in one block and they are increasing the block size to allow 2MB blocks. In this case, security flaws are possible but not worrisome (unless of course they manage to fuck up their systems while implementing the update).
Bitcoin replay attacks apply to the introduction of BTG.
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:28:16
Okay, basically, you have two kinds of forks: A soft fork and a hard fork.
Bitcoin's network or protocol follows a set of rules, such as a maximum block size etc. During a hard fork, rules are removed or modified. A soft fork is when a rule is added. When a rule is modified or otherwise removed, such as the current block size being increased, a split in the blockchain occurs. A blockchain is essentially where records of transactions are kept along with other information. This blockchain cannot continue as one when a hard fork happens, because there are different rules to follow. So a split occurs. 
In this case, Bitcoin will continue to exist alongside a new set of rules that split it. There are some security flaws that can occur as a result of this split, but that wouldn't be explaining it like you're 5, so you can research that later.
Another thing to note is that the new coin, or BTG (Bitcoin Gold) that will be created as a result of this split, will be given on a 1:1 basis in some exchanges, so if you own 1BTC, you will be given 1BTG. Again, due to some flaws, you can spend the BTG and end up spending the BTC unintentionally, but that's part of a more complicated explanation.
Overall, what you need to know is that everything will most likely be fine. Bitcoin has handled situations similar to this before. Might want to be careful with your BTG if you get some as a result of the chain split though.
For anyone unfamiliar with the security flaws, you can read up on "Bitcoin replay attacks" to learn more. Might be a bit complicated but there are useful guides that make it simple to understand without assuming you have a background in computer science. One example is  which explains it as "To be more specific, the bitcoin 'replay attack' issue would allow an attacker to steal users coins. While the coins wouldn’t necessarily go to the attacker’s wallet address, this vulnerability could empty users’ wallets on the alternate chain."

I can imagine them completely obliterating the company's buildings and just bringing chunks of stone and metal to the dude who bought all of it.
