Did you not hear me say Freelance??   
  
man, what was the point you were trying make again?   
that's right... 
you didnt have one  
but you will just continue spinning in circles with your circular logic until you die... alone and sad. But at least you made your point about... what again?   
oh right you didnt want me to waste the communities time with my question. Mission accomplished: you're an idiot.

Close to 100.

wow, i am flattered that you are spending so much time and energy on this. It must be really important to you. even 12 hours since it has been resolved and you are still thinking about it.  
  
I imagine it affected your sleep since it appears to be the first order of business out of bed. 
  
you are doing a great service for the bitcoin community, i'm sure everyone can agree.  
  
Please continue this, I cannot wait to hear your sad and lonely rebuttal.

I'm sorry if it's already been asked or explained, but could someone tell me what HD wallets are? Or provide a link. I'm a bitcoin noob. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 00:20:51
not if i see you first ;)

I am not looking for credit or trying to break a news story.  
I have looked into this.  
I've spent the last 2 hours looking into this.    
I didn't ask for a bitpay subreddit.    
I never complained about anything.    
I am only looking for people with similar problems or answers.     
  
I dont think you have any right to tell me what questions I am allowed to ask. If you do not like my question then you do not have to comment on it, and no one asked you to anyway.  
  
 I tried to be polite and explain the reasons I posted my question here, which I think were all justified. I do not have do things the way you want me to. I am allowed to peruse answers to my questions any way I want to and not by your rules. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 17:18:39
you are trying to argue semantics now?  
and no, freelancer is the opposite of a company you fucking idiot.  
are you insane?  
what am i trying to be right about?  
why should i post my website?  
hey, go fuck your self  
I'll post my website when you post a picture of your naked mom, both are equally relevant to my original question

EFT Sweep just happened. Was later than usual, But everything is good now.
@_date: 2014-02-19 00:47:09
Oh I forgot yesterday was presidents day!  
That makes sense! thank you.   
I still wouldve expected to see the eft sweep sometime today.  
But this at least now I know it hasnt actually been 3 days.
  
This is why I didn't want to submit a support ticket, in case it was just something simple that I wasn't considering.
@_date: 2014-02-19 19:04:07
well its a good thing i came along, I guess up until now you must have been feeling pretty worthless about yourself. Which was obvious from the beginning.  
  
Eventually you will forget about me and not long after the warm glow will wear off and soon the feeling of emptiness will slowly creep back in. So you start another troll war with someone new that you will lose but somehow convince yourself you won to feel better about yourself again, at least for a bit, and that cycle will repeat over and over until one day you realize you've made horrible mistake, you thought that happiness came from making other people feel miserable, but in the end all it left you feeling was hollow inside and lacking true meaning in you life. The empty pit of despair becomes unbearable and nothing will alleviate it so, as a last resort you find the tallest building you can get access to but that turns out to be only 8 stories high. As a result, your suicide is botched and you are left to be a vegetable unable to communicate or move but conscious enough to feel the everlasting void of emptiness and regret while in your head you're begging for someone to turn the life support off but all they do is feed you apple sauce and wipe your chin, this sustains you for many, many years. Eventually you go mad inside your own skull and try to eat your own tongue chewing it off bit by bit but you are on your back paralysed and the tongue bits have no where to go but into the back of your throat which provide you with a slow and agonizing death. true story

Thank you

Just say it's doing more than 300 times better than the dollar.
@_date: 2014-02-19 17:59:21

The reasons I posted this here:  
- I wanted to ask a knowledgeable community that had a lot  of active users.  
- I wanted normal peoples thoughts on this, not a canned response from the company.  
- There are no forums or subreddits devoted to bitpay that I could find.  
- It is very hard to find any information to this by searching google, the closest thing I could find were other questions about bit-pay in this subreddit. So it seemed worth a shot.  
- I wanted to get a quicker response.  
- I didn't want to open a support ticket unless I could not get the information from experienced users first.  
- I want the community to know this is happeneing.

I cant youre too far gone  
have you tried moving out of your parents house?
@_date: 2014-02-19 15:07:36
Bravo!  
well, what can I say. I forgot about a holiday.  
And frankly, I am so glad I did.  
Never has my absent mindedness lead me on such an entertaining journey before.  
  
Hey genius! Where did you get the idea anyone trusts me with their money?  Who said I run a company? Are you just making up scenarios in your head now? Have you been pacing back and forth all morning mumbling to yourself?  
God, I sure hope so... 
  
You already provide an excellent service. It's really something special.  
Keep it coming!
@_date: 2014-02-19 17:55:33

Either way, I'd rather the coen brothers Make this film than pretty much anyone else. Could you imagine this story being told by Michael bay
@_date: 2016-10-15 11:50:02
This isn't the only kind of movie they do. No country for old men, true grit, a serious man etc. None of these films followed that format.
