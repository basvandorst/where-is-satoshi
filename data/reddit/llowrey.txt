Companies like PayPal, Circle, etc are buying incrementally to fund their adoptation would be my guess.

30 minutes left... come on, I have non-coin friends who need to know the speed of the bitcoin community &gt;)

It is working OK now.

Oh that is brilliant :)

A third-rate firm in a dying technology bracket which only Americans have even heard of accepts Bitcoin. This is not the news it's made out to be.

Air companies that look to the future is always good, especially in a dying business.

This is... incredibly simple and intuitive. Good job!

The difference between Ripple and Bitcoin: If Satoshi were to dump, people would buy as if no tomorrow.

CNBC: "Do you own Bitcoin yourself?"
eBay CEO: "Yes, yes I do."
Jaw, meet floor. Floor, jaw.

This is actually a good post.

Bitcoin is only illegal because the timber industry saw it as a threat to their rope business. 
It doesn't have nearly as many negative side effects as fiat and the cost of keeping it in the shadows is huge. 
Besides it's far more dangerous for people to get scammed on the street, swiping bar codes with strangers than if institutions would give them education and access to it.

Imagine if Facebook integrated bitcoin into the fabric of the site. You could crowdfund parties, events, right on the page. I could pay the concert ticket right on my wall, when my favorite artist announces a tour.

1) Name sounds like it's forced to be clever.
2) Logo looks like a tilted fleshlight.

Kraken is fantastic, I have had nothing but good experiences with them. Fast and friendly support guys and next-day deposits.

Ask this on Bitcointalk.org and wait for someone in a selling mood to PM you.

Actually a great idea. I would do this for ALL small purchases here and there. Spend $5, automatically replenish $5.

Go to your Netflix account, open the instant-chat, and ask for Bitcoin: Requests will add up...

I love the design of it - don't change a thing! Love how the address book/transaction history looks. Really, really cool.

If/when this replaces eBay, I shall cry through my penis.

That's right, this is the first time the CEO has publically said he owns bitcoin himself.

Just put the QR-code for the Donation Address on the wikipedia page - It won't dilute the other payment options that way, and donating through it will be easy peasy.

I am an average student, but I would pay random cent-amounts EVERY TIME I read articles I enjoyed, but I would never, ever, click any ads. In fact, they're blocked anyway.

Notice how he uses double-spacing after full stops. Just like the "original" Satoshi Nakamoto did. That can't be a coincidence, can it?

Sweden has Swish (instant bank transfer across Swedish banks), which lessens the need for Bitcoin.
