I see thank you.

Paypal doesn't wait people buying bitcoins because they could potential replace paypal in the future.

Can someone extrapolate on the Swiss attack?

And then he woke up and realized it was all a dream.

Even if it takes over as a one world currency that amount will be worth [$20,141,056.93]( maximum of course I guess inflation of the USD could arguably raise it substantially although this is a real long shot.
If it takes over paypal then it will be worth ~$2700 for that amount.

Thanks for the advice.

Overlaying the graphs would be awesome I tried to do it before but got too lazy and scrapped the whole thing..
@_date: 2012-10-27 02:57:24
Awesome stuff, will be using.
@_date: 2012-09-15 18:36:47
Thanks for the info.
Why would you not recommend investing?  I know it is high risk, but are the rewards not potentially worth it in your opinion?
@_date: 2012-10-13 00:55:38
Paypal hates bitcoin, it is a potential threat to them so they will not allow you to make transactions through them that could potentially ruin them.
@_date: 2012-10-14 01:34:00
It is possible.  Entropy is a characteristic not a physical object.  It is my understanding that entropy gives bitcoin its scarcity and decentralization,flexibility,and anonymity which gives it its value.  All of which are non physical properties.
@_date: 2012-10-06 17:18:24
Wow, it is very related.  Thanks for the work.
@_date: 2012-11-10 02:11:35
Please keep at least 10% for yourself.  This way you can do crash tests and things to further the progress.
@_date: 2012-09-16 01:06:25
"generally accepted" Damn.
@_date: 2012-10-07 23:41:59
Oh I see, that is interesting.  Kind of like proof that the government would have a nearly impossible task ahead of them should they decide to make bitcoins illegal if I am understanding you correctly.
@_date: 2012-10-05 20:25:34
My thoughts exactly.  The 15$ barrier has a lot of resistance but I see it breaking some time in December.

Hmm I see your point.  However in infancy many stocks and even currencies have been extremely volatile and based strictly on popularity.  I do however see the bitcoin economy to have stabilized the last 6 months.  It has had steady growth since Nov 2011, and I see it becoming more valuable as new services incorporate it.  If I had a large online business I would want to keep as little money in paypal as possible I would love to offer bitcoin.  Paypal is a pain in the ass and it has a bunch of fees.  The API is also one of the worst I have seen.
I personally think if some sort of solid API was developed (I know a few companies have made some) the bitcoin economy would take off.  I don't think security wise bitcoin is by any means insecure, however to me it seems the services using it have the vulnerabilities.
Personally my reason for investing would be because I hate Paypal and the banks and think in the future bitcoin could take a large chunk out of paypal's business.  What would this require? Well I think it would need some large companies utilizing it.  Illicit activities seem to keep the currency somewhat stable but not much in terms of growth.  I also think that in the future if online casinos used bitcoin and others became aware that it is not all that different from any other form of currency (in terms of how it is valued) it would definitely take off.
I bought a little over $4,000 when it was worth about $6 in June so that panned out well and now I am considering doubling down if the price drops off a bit.
I knew this thread would not be very popular seeing as many people are heavily invested with bitcoin and they don't like any sort of negative talk, however I think it is necessary to get these issues out in the open in order to increase long term confidence.

List left out [ I used them before along with another survey site.
+1 though since overall this is a good list.  I haven't even heard of most of these sites.

~~As long as you wait for 4/6 confirmations is it safe to assume the transaction is valid?  Or is this irrelevant?  Sorry I am trying to grasp what is really meant by double spending.  Obviously you can't multiply bitcoins so then it is a spoof, but if it is a spoof then waiting for full confirmation will correct the faulty transaction right?~~
Never mind:


@_date: 2012-10-07 00:21:44
But why?
@_date: 2012-10-06 02:26:15
I disagree if large companies store transactions in bitcoin rather than on paypal it will also drive up prices.  Paypal fees might cause businesses to move to bitcoin in the future.
@_date: 2012-10-01 02:36:58
I never bought any, but I used [ to get my first bitcoin when they were worth a lot less.
@_date: 2013-05-06 05:06:19
Yay I was the 2nd biggest sucker.
That sucks though man, I feel for us.
@_date: 2013-01-09 10:59:14
Sounds like a fortune cookie.

I just don't know how he will pay it back since he was already ~1mil in debt from the hack, I am betting we all get fucked over.  Oh well there goes my kids college savings. :/

I have $6753.14, I pmed you.

I am laughing so fucking hard right now.
@_date: 2013-04-06 20:30:18
I am laughing my ass off right now that this generic statement got down voted so hard.
