Two questions from a small-time HODL-er:
1) I bought bitcoin last year when it was at around $4,000. Do I have to file taxes for it if I haven't "cashed out" by converting it into fiat?
2) I have some bitcoin on Coinbase and Bittrex. Is this a bad idea? I read posts all the time where people with a lot of money on Coinbase get screwed, but to be honest I only invested around $2,000 back when it was $4,000USD/BTC.

WOOT BOUGHT A LOT AT THE DIP!

Yeah :( That would have been nice.
I just regularly buy $25 per week now because it was stressing me out before when I would try to predict dips and rises.

Probably will buy way more the next time it dips down $10,000.

This is pretty much what regular Forex is based on.

Bought more at $13,500 just now. Wondering if that was a bad idea lol.

I bought $25 in Bitcoin when it dipped temporarily to 9500$/Bitcoin! :)

I was using Coinbase but moved my holdings to Bittrex. Is it possible to purchase Bitcoin using USD on Bittrex? Sorry, I'm a new to this :\

Just bought $250 at $10,500/BTC. It wasn't at $7,000/BTC but it's better than nothing.

I see. That makes sense!
How difficult/time-consuming is it to make a physical wallet?

I feel so dumb because I bought some Bitcoin on Coinbase when it was at $3500 USD and just moved them to Bittrex. Besides that, I don't know too much about these other things. Am I just losing money by doing this?

So from my limited understanding, people who hold Bitcoin will get some Bitcoin Gold through a fork. However, if you have your BTC on an exchange, the exchange can take it ownership of the Bitcoin Gold that was produced through the fork?

Will I be rewarded Bitcoin Gold if I have my coins on Bittrex? Purchased from Coinbase though.
