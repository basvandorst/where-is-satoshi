Isn't this the same idiot that swallowed the Seth Reich bullshit story hook line and sinker? 
He may be right about BTC growing with mass adoption but you don't really need to be an oracle to divine that.

I'm not sure what he is saying exactly. Trezor will never give you cash for your bitcoins. It is a 'cold storage' wallet. meaning that it is more secure. 
You are the only on that has the private key. In order to sell the BTC back into dollars you would need to use an exchange or some other similar service. 
It is easy to move your BTC to Trezor - it is as simple as sending it to the wallet address. 
It **is** harder to send your coins from your trezor to any other wallet *but that is the point*
It is harder because you have to plug in the Trezor to the computer and confirm the transaction. It is for security so your coins don't get stolen. 
for someone to steal your coins they would have to have physical access to the trezor AND know your pin. It is a very secure way to store BTC

Except that the cash apps spot price of btc is $150 higher than the actual price of btc

I just checked before I posted the previous comment and it was at 150 over spot. 
I'm not saying cash app is a bad way to buy btc though cause that's the only fee. 
I think coinbase pro is cheaper but there is the hold on the coins.
It really depends on if you need the coins immediately or not.

You can buy and sell (Limit orders) of BTC for free on the coinbase exchange GDAX

21 means you have 1 millionth of all the coins that will ever be mined. So if you had 1 millionth of all the gold that will be mined that would be nice. 
But then again, Bitcoin could be at the moon in 10 years or valueless. It is speculative.
