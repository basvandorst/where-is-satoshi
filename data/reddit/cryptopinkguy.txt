Good for you, got the same plan before I realized I'm too dumb for trading lol. Still holding though, got all my initial spendings back, couldn't be happier about it!

This quote is about me turning a pillow cold side up

I never give out advices if I'm not sure. With bitcoin I'n not sure in 99% of cases, so..

They should make Bitcoin wine, this is what actually gets better with time
@_date: 2019-11-06 15:33:23
Cause now it's considered by them as industry to ELIMINATE others

You have to get KYC when starting a new game. Bitcoin is getting more value as you progress in game
@_date: 2019-11-17 01:33:31
Also when you realize what fiat really is

All I know is that effectiveness is inversely proportional to BTC price

And while US is still trying to figure out how to slip through club bouncers China's already rocking the dancefloor

That's not true, this starts to happen only now

They say hoarding is a bad habit, not in this case though

"The Government" is a rather human thing too. It's just the fact that government also consists of hoomans that play their games and really fuck up the whole system cause they just don't care

I skipped the vegan part, feel greater than ever

If certain laws work only within those lines than it's more than just lines

I see quite the opposite outcome. It'd be like Mekka for bitcoiners. Imagine flocks of cryptoenthusiasts going there just to see how all this works out. You can only get a visa if you pass the test on crypto tho

What I like the most is the 3,5% fee, it's almost nothing esp for ATM
@_date: 2019-12-12 23:12:32
I'd agree to have this instead of lambo if it gets me back to 2010 and then fast forward to Dec 2017
@_date: 2019-12-12 00:05:08
I'd rather compare them to treasure chests
@_date: 2019-12-05 00:10:15
It's worth it tho if you know how to launder money and keep it out of feds reach
@_date: 2019-12-19 01:15:59
The ETH one should just have one giant pineapple in the middle
@_date: 2019-12-06 17:06:20
More like Half-Life 2 Citadel
@_date: 2019-12-19 01:14:36
The question that's always bothered me is why do you need a lambo when you're riding a rocket
@_date: 2019-12-29 04:21:13
It rather will be worth more fiat pretty soon
@_date: 2019-12-27 02:30:08
I think it's scare tactics rather than just "accidental" slip of hand
@_date: 2019-12-19 23:49:35
HK people can have a hard time withdrawing crypto though

Also huge props to Germans for being honest and real, I still can't wrap my head around how they just put it out in public
@_date: 2019-12-26 01:03:14
That's the Asia I like. So far away from China yet so close

Man, what a time it will be someday. Someday...
