Shit man, you could also set up some kind of thing for returning adult students to be able to finish grad school without losing their house... *clears throat loudly*

The last time I bought something from you I used bitcoin, and payment had never been easier, or more permanent. However, you then decided to send me an email a day later to "confirm" my order, during which time the items I ordered sold out. Three days after that, the items were available again, but at a significantly higher price. Given your policy of not refunding bitcoin I felt trapped, as I didn't want to spend the money on anything else, and I didn't want the original items at the new, highly inflated price. 
My hypothesis is that you saw I had paid with BTC and of course couldn't reverse the payment, and you knew that item would be selling out soon, and you took advantage of the situation.
In my opinion, these are the types of practices that will kill the mass adoption of bitcoin, and it's why I will never buy anything from you again.

Did you finish reading the article? Half of the circuit courts in the US were above 70%, and only two were below 50%. It also pointed out that of the total number of cases decided by the ninth circuit court only a few(far fewer than 1%) were even heard by the Supreme Court, and that's usually the case. They only decide to hear cases which are highly complex and of questionable constitutionality in the first place, so the fact that there are high reversal rates is to be somewhat expected.

The EO doesn't have to explicitly say anything about religion for it to be a violation of the first amendment. The President is on record as saying that he would institute a ban on Muslims, and there is plenty of precedent for the courts to make a judgment on context. Also, the EO targeted green card holders who are guaranteed due process by law, and the president does not have individual the right to overturn laws without congress. And finally, we are signatories of multiple treaties(such as with NATO and the UN, and many others) that say we will treat people seeking asylum a certain way, and while regular travelers are not asylum seekers, a blanket travel ban puts us in violation of those treaties, and again, the president doesn't have the right to do that without congress. It is clearly unconstitutional.

Now, now; don’t fight. There’s plenty of injustice to go around...

I think just because some philosophies align, there's no reason to think Trump's average supporter knows anything about bitcoin other than "drugs" or "terrorists."  For the most part his supporters wouldn't bat an eye at his coming down on bitcoin.

The first amendment expands beyond just issues of imprisonment. You’re right that people incorrectly take its meaning to be that one should be shielded from any kind of censure or reprisal from other citizens or corporate entities, but it should shield you from anything the government might do in response to that speech, which should include their being able to bar you from flying. I know it doesn’t always boil down that way in the real world, but the first amendment should apply here if he didn’t actually make a threat.

Ugh, god, this is making my left ball hurt... please just let him off with an nice dinner at an expensive restaurant or something.

For me this is like a breath of fresh air. I got out at $1400, and then of course was kicking myself during the rest of the rise.

Seriously. And I know it's unrelated, but after the news this week, fuck everything about any mechanism of control they hold over us.

Have you ever bought bitcoin from them before?
@_date: 2013-11-21 14:40:08
Yea I hope this is the case.  I'll find out tomorrow I guess.  Sorry that happened to you.
@_date: 2013-11-21 03:22:34
Perhaps could comment?  I have a pending order from Saturday that is due to arrive on Friday, and I'm nervous about this as well.  It certainly would work in their favor...
Not that I expect this to happen.  They've already taken the money from my bank account, and I've had nothing but positive experiences with them so far.

Yea they can be finicky. I find the older versions are more forgiving though. If you're not having any luck with the new port, just switch back to the first one and it will be like nothing ever happened.

Well basically, they are between four and ten months behind(depending on who you ask) on delivering miners to customers who have already paid, which really screws them since with the way difficulty is rising even being on the short end of that list means you will never get a full return on your investment.  The difficulty issue is the same case with most or all of the mining products you can buy right now, but BFL is by far the worst in terms of misleading promises/outright dishonesty, customer service and super-late or possibly never coming deliveries.
TLDR: STAY AWAY!

Most recently I ordered last saturday night(11/16) and they arrived yesterday.  They charged me the Saturday price, and I received all the coin that I ordered. Now, had I done the same on Monday, it would have been a different story, though from what I've heard on Reddit I think they were pretty upfront about that.  In the interim I was definitely convincing myself that they were just going to cancel the order and keep the appreciated value for themselves, but nope.  They've been an honest(if not super quick) business every time I've dealt with them.

Ahh, I think I see what you're doing here, sooo, "eghem!"
*begins speaking in a purposefully-too-loud voice* "Yes, I also think myself and hundreds and thousands of people I know are also planning to make BIG purchases of BTC very,very soon!"
I really hope this works;)

Whatever...  I, for one, am happy with my Coinbase experience.  The only "bad" experience I've had is buying low, then watching the price rise before the coins hit my account, and I sit there wondering if they will come through or not.  Then, I get on Reddit and my paranoia gets totally exacerbated... that is, until the coins come as promised, which they always have.  I realize that for some people, life happens, as it has to me, and you want liquidity NOW, but oh well.  I just remind myself that it was I who overextended myself, and really 5 days is about the norm for credits back to your account in other situations, for instance, store returns from a debit card purchase.  All in all, I've been happy with Coinbase, and I'm sure their capacity for timely service will grow right along with bitcoin itself.
