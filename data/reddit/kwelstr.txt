There are other exchanges where you do not need to verify your ID. A massive dump or many mini-dumps will bring the price down all around.

Well, you may be wrong then. While bitcoin is a great coin, the protocol is slow to confirm and you can only do bitcoin with bitcoin. Ripple protocol allows to transfer any currency and the confirmation takes 5 seconds. You can send fiat, or BTC or any other coin or their own XRP (ripples). 
My guess that is why they included it in the talk.

* 1.- Acquire bitcoins
* 2.- Sell bitcoins
* 3.- Profit???
* 4.- Pay taxes on profit.

The best faucet I've found is  You can use it once per hour, but they only pay once a week, on Mondays, and it is not that much either. I used to go there several times a day and made about 25 cents before I got tired of that game.
One thing that did pay out is opening a ripple wallet at ripple.com. They are giving away XRP and since December I have collected about 100 Dollars worth. Not bad for free, heh. Also I am trading them in and out of BTC and making small profits, just for fun, won't pay the rent, but it is not a lot of work.
Good luck!

Ok, then if you have lets say 100 BTC at an average of 850 USD each, you have a cost basis of 85,000 USD. The current market value at this moment is 36,000 USD. This is what you can do: sell your BTC at this price and buy them back. You will have a nice capital loss that you can claim. You buy back the BTC and you will still have them at a lower cost basis.
I did something like that with stocks when they collapsed in 2001 and enjoyed my capital loss for several years while at the same time I bought different stocks that appreciated in price over time. Win-win.
***Edit, with stocks you can buy a different stock right away or wait a period of time before you buy back the same stock and still claim capital loss. I am not sure how long you need to wait with BTC. Ask an accountant.

Yep, I was there and the presentation was the strongest from the start up group. The whole concept makes a lot of sense once you understand how disruptive it is. Can't wait to see it live.

I sent a payment last Friday and by mistake the fee was 10 satoshi. It took a day to confirm, but it went through. Low fees still work, if you want to take the pain of the wait.

I will be agnostic on this one: it's free money, it would be silly to say no to it and LTC never gave me any matching bitcoin coins. Thanks for the airdrop! :D
Edit: grammar

There is no free money, that's a mistake gamblers make. Once you realized your gains, it is your money to lose. That's the only sane way to trade. I learned that from past mistakes, heh.

First, did you sell your antshares/NEO or are you holding? I don't see them on that list and they are one of the selected few that are outperforming bitcoin.
Second, since you bought before Aug 1st, have you claimed the fork coins? That is a small chunk of free money right there. 
Good luck and don't feel too badly, you have way more bitcon that most of us, and just hold them and check back in a year or so, you'll thank yourself for that.

What you are missing (LOL) is deep reasoning. That article is so shallow that it doesn't even grant an analysis. The value of a currency, any currency, depends on the value of the country as a whole, the economic value, the intellectual property value, the value of its political freedoms, the value of its banking system, the value of the anti corruption laws, the value of its population and its freedoms, etc. It goes on an on but you get the point. And then you need inflation to keep with the population growth and the population wealth growth. 
Once you start to study all that and spend some years pondering what each other country in the world does and how much it should their currency be worth you will get to a better understanding of who is who and what is what, just don't read junk, cause that's what will pollute your mind with useless info.

BCC is bitcoin cash, a fork of BTC that's happening Aug 1st. If you have your bitcoin private keys or your bitcoin on an exchange that supports the fork then you get the same amount of BCC as the BTC you hold.
BCC futures here:

Word to the wise, beware of ETFs, the devil is in the details. Some ETFs actually trade in futures and don't own the commodity. I have not read the prospectus.
