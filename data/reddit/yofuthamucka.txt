Plot twist: Bitcoin inventor is Dorian's grandmother and Dorian was just doing the work on the computer cause grandma has arthritis but he had a stroke and doesn't remember any of it now.

This is huge.. if in fact it is the original Satoshi. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 03:51:20
It's grandma. She is the inventor.

Could this be the same guy?

What about annotations?

Most def every free system should do it, but the thing is, what's in for them.  If they took a transaction cut, say 2% or something, I could see that being meaningful for them.
Good thoughts here and a tip well deserved

Pretty much true. In their earlier history, they would have taken bitcoin with open arms

Can you mention where those are? I would be eager to see/meet/chat with those channels where tipping is actually creating enough income
@_date: 2014-02-19 02:15:19
So am I right in calculating Google makes roughly $1000-$2000 a month from your channel, and that you get around 55% of that per month?
@_date: 2014-02-18 09:03:32
Do you think this can be done programatically? ie: someone enters their youtube channel and password on some website and videos are automatically overlayed?

Thanks for the laugh

Really? Seriously
@_date: 2014-02-19 02:22:10


That's exactly something I have been thinking about. I think a good social experiment is to find out if a tipping economy actually works
