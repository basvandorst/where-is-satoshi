Stability with respect to an inflated fiat currency may not be a good thing.

Totally bro, because we all know the "protection of capital" comes out of thin air, and at no cost to anyone anywhere ever /s

Is there a whitepaper for the segwit technicals?

Does heaven have a whitepaper? What are the devs like?

There are two major things that bitcoin is: a computer technology, and an economic "thing". Decide which aspect you want to know about first.

Ok, so maybe I was mistaken... Jesus Christ.
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:02:23
So why exactly are these exchanges so sketchy? Is is just the current volume bogging them down from their other services? Also does anyone know of any good peer-to-peer platforms?
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:07:05
Minus a few hiccups, poloniex is pretty great for me. I know tons of people have had major problems with getting their money stuck there for a long time. I like it because it has a live API, and a variety of options to trade from.

"Easing regulations on banks" is a misnomer. What is going to happen is that the government is going to look the other way when the banks commit what many would consider unethical. This is because its government collusion that cornered the banking industry for them, and brought us where we are. 50 years ago in the US, there was a bank in every major town that would have been based in that town. Interest rates on savings were over 1% in many of them too. Now its down to like four or five banks, and maybe some investment agencies. The interest you get is so low, and in return they benevolently claim that lending is easier, which it is. They want an economy where the average individual is reluctant to save. Only when money retains this dynamic, deprecating, and constantly liquid nature can they truly exploit the possibility of continuously using the Federal Reserves ability to print money; and this is how they stay on top of the rest of the world.
TLDR: The banking industry and the government are intertwined to the core, and any regulation they "make" or "ease" will eventually benefit the oligarchs. This will be true as long as there is a Federal Reserve Bank.

I’m fairly libertarian, and I can assure you that most rational people only oppose *government* regulation of cryptos. Self regulation is a great virtue and must be celebrated. 
Other self regulatory bodies like ACM/IEEE come to mind.

It’s possible to not hodl and also believe that the price of BTC could exceed 20k in years to come

Why coinbase?
@_date: 2017-09-08 18:06:17
Like which one? There isn't one I've seen yet that lets you short cryptos?

I'm just your everyday, blue-collar, bitcoin technician.
@_date: 2017-09-09 01:18:17
Excuse my lack of knowledge, but how exactly do you short stuff on Poloniex?

Technical analysis is simply tracking self fulfilling prophecies. You’re a fool to always only rely on TA, and you’re a fool to not use TA when the markets are stable

Forget the iching. I'm selling quality crystal balls for 0.1 BTC (or equivalent ETH). Incantations are extra.

If you spend your money on yourself in a way that you find best and will improve your life in a peaceful manner, then you are automatically contributing to peace and progress.
@_date: 2017-06-28 03:44:27
I'd wager the NSA's hand in this is more direct than they claim.

Totally not on the same level, but Poloniex gave me trouble with my 2FA a while back. I thought I was being ripped off, but it ended up being slow, but helpful, technical support. I'd wait another week to call it a month of waiting, and then hire a lawyer.
