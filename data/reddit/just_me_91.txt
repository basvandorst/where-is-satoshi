I agree, it will have higher fees than the lightning network. But also I think the fees will be much lower than they are right now. There will be an equilibrium. I have no idea where that will be. But I don't think it will make it prohibitive to send bitcoin to the lightning network.

He's saying that most wallets have several bitcoin addresses that it might store your bitcoin on. By sending this 9 dollars to your wallet, it's likely stored on a new address. If you spent all of your bitcoin, and these 9 dollars were included, it would need to include the input of the address that the 9 dollars are stored on in the transaction. This makes the transaction take up more bytes of space, which will make the transaction cost more in fees. The added bytes used to account for this extra input might cost more than the 9 dollars you have in that address.

It wouldn't be the same, exorbitant fees. The vast majority of transactions would be done off chain, on the lightning network. So the transaction fees on the bitcoin network itself would be low. There would be no backlog (hopefully). The fees would probably be higher than the lightning network, but they probably won't be crazy. And even still, a month or two ago I used a wallet to set the fees for my transaction. I sent a somewhat large amount of money for only a dollar or two by setting my fee to 30 satoshis per byte. And it had 6 confirmations within an hour.

I think you might be right... but I don't agree. I had some bitcoin in 2013, and then I started buying again in August of this year. So I'm a new investor, and I plan on holding through any crash. Because I do believe in it, and the other people that I have gotten into it also believe in it. I don't think the crash will be any worse than usual.
If anything I think it will be less worse. There is so much demand for bitcoin right now. People are eager to buy any dip. Plus institutional money is about to get into it. I think 2018 will be a very good year for Bitcoin, and the next big crash will leave us somewhere higher than where we are now. I don't have anything to back this up, it's just the feeling that I have.
Then there's also the fact that for most people getting into cryptos, the only thing they've heard of is Bitcoin. If they're going to buy something, it's going to be Bitcoin. That will certainly prop it up and make it a safer bet. Any other coin needs to have a use case. Any other coin needs to use the blockchain technology in a way that can make money, a way that will bring true value to the world. Bitcoin doesn't need that. Bitcoin is digital gold. Bitcoin's use case is that it's worth money. The higher it's value goes, the more it fulfills its use case. Bitcoin is important and will be the store of value of the future, the reserve currency of all cryptos. And this is all simply because Bitcoin was the first. It doesn't matter if another coin can do it slightly better. Because Bitcoin is the one that has cornered the market on being a store of value. You say that those who do it first don't win. And that's true of companies. I'd say that's true of alt coins. Like I said, they need an actual use case. But Bitcoin's main feature is that it's worth money, and that you can exchange it relatively easily. Any new coin trying to do this will not have the immense user base that bitcoin has, or it's history and value, and will have an extremely hard time gaining traction.
I'm not claiming that Bitcoin will surely continue to be successful. Anything can happen. But I have a hard time seeing it reversing course in the near future. And even if it does have a big crash, I'm willing to hold onto it, because I'm pretty sure it will come back in time. Bitcoin won't die, and people will always be willing to pay at least something for Bitcoin. I may be wrong, but this is how I see it, and I think Bitcoin has a good future ahead of it.
Edit: Also if another coin does truly start to take over the store of value that bitcoin has, I think it would be somewhat gradual and there would be time to diversify and eventually switch over. It's something that I'll be constantly monitoring.

Gemini gives you access to your deposit immediately. You just have to wait for the deposit to clear before you can move your crypto at all. Gemini also now has active trader (you have to request them to enable it) which is comparable to coinbase pro, and has low fees.

And that's great! It's always good to help others get started. I'd recommend looking through this if you already haven't, it has a ton of good information. Sorry again if I was a little too harsh!

Bitcoin.tax seems like a pretty good site. That's what I plan on using. It can handle many exchanges and up to 100 transactions for free. More than that, and a premium account costs $20

I like bits. Maybe eventually a bit will be seen as like a dollar and a satoshi will be seen like a cent. Not saying that that's where the price will end up in USD, but that it will be a similar way to look at it.

At most exchanges, the ethereum and litecoin prices are based on Bitcoin. So if Bitcoin crashes, so does the usd value of the others. This isn't always the case, sometimes they move independently of each other if news comes out about one of them specifically.

Yes, the fees are high right now. Core developers are working on a solution. If you use a different sofware wallet, you can pick your own fees and pay much much less. Although that might make it take longer. Down below you said you helped your hairdresser "set up a blockchain". I don't mean to be mean or anything, but it sounds like you don't know very much about this technology. If you are seriously complaining, then you need to do research to understand the current state of the technology. If you just thought it was funny, then I apologize for being somewhat rude in my response. 
My point is that yes there are problems right now, but this isn't how Bitcoin is supposed to function. I just don't want you to discourage others from using it. Bitcoin currently isn't functional enough to be a currency. Think of it more as digital gold. It is deflationary and a store of wealth. After they finish the lightning network, it will be able to handle all this demand and it will be able to function as a currency as well.

So I just realized I didn't know we were talking about brainwallet.org. The link went to blockchain.info and that's what I thought we were talking about the whole time. Are there any security issues with blockchain?

I don't really understand. I just made an account there and it asks me to make a password and then gives me a mnemonic that is around 20 words that I can use to reset my password if I ever forget it. Is the password the same as a passphrase? I never once saw it suggest "correct horse battery staple" for anything. I just would like to know what needs to be done to make it safe.

Weird. You chose my birthday. RemindMe! 365 days "Do another until March 26 2020"

Do you have a source? I haven't seen that anywhere. I did hear that one group of miners was going to mine it, but that can't really go anywhere if it's a small group.

But they called off the fork. That's part of why it crashed last week.
@_date: 2018-02-27 05:54:55
That's part of what he talks about. He said the millenials are just now starting to come into their prime earning years. So they'll have more money for investments, and they've shown more interest in crypto. So it's a possibility. The video is interesting, he talks about how the different generations have affected the economy based on what they wanted to invest in.

I know this comment is somewhat old. But 400 per month is less than 100 per week. 100 per week is 433 per month (each month has on average 4.33333 weeks). But also, with a rising asset, getting the money in sooner will allow you to capture more gains. If bitcoin was falling in price, it'd be the opposite. I think bitcoin has a lot higher to go, so adding money as soon as possible will give the best gains. But I admittedly know not a ton about this. Anyone could be wrong, bitcoin could crash and never recover, although I don't see that happening with the mainstream attention and interest from wall street.
@_date: 2018-02-27 04:20:52
He did, he says that if mellenials put 10% of their income into crypto, then by the end of the cycle, it should be worth around 10 Million dollars. The whole video is pretty interesting.
@_date: 2018-02-27 06:38:58
Yeah, he said by the end of the cycle. I take that to mean probably a couple decades from now. And that's assuming that bitcoin is still the top crypto. So it's more him saying that that's the highest he can see Bitcoin going if it achieves what it's trying to achieve.  I don't really think it's likely it'll get to that point, but it does show what the potential is. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 16:25:28
But I think that's the point of what Tom Lee is saying. That millennials are just now starting to get into their prime earning years, and can have a big impact on the price of crypto going forward. It's all speculation, it's just a trend that he can see happening. It doesn't mean bitcoin will get that high, it doesn't even mean that it'll ever reach a new high. But it means there's a lot of potential. It remains to be seen whether that potential will be reached. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:54:25
You say you only take bitcoins? Like you won't take cash or credit/debit? Does that affect your business at all?
