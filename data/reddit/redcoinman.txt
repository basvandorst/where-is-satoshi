Fair enough.  I get it now :)

Is something wrong with your caps lock key?

Why bother to make 1/6 of it about boring scamcoins? 
@_date: 2014-08-08 18:57:31
So, since they now accept Bitcoin with which they cannot scam they are no longer scammers.
OP SUCCESS!

I wouldn't trust anyone who accepts litecoin with a set of safety scissors. Anyone who isn't smart enough to realize the flaws and pointlessness of litecoin isn't competent enough to provide the service they claim to provide.

I didn't put a NSFW on that link, so you should probably click it.

Me thinks you should probably save those Bitcoins to pay for some mental health services...

Every now and then I get the urge to travel by rail...but then I find out I'll have to pay 3x as much as a plane ticket and spend upwards of 4 days to go just a thousand miles :(

They didn't get a penny from me either!
Though they did get about .08 BTC....

There is nothing efficient about the bitcoin market yet

What you are witnessing is the end game of capitalist and libertarian philosophy.

Started from the bottom, now you're here

Just mash them

You can't be for real, right?

First, you didn't write this to "help" other people.  You wrote it because you're afraid of weak hands damaging your profits.  
Second, if bitcoin is so weak that it can be destroyed by a couple weak hands panicking, then it had no value to begin with.
