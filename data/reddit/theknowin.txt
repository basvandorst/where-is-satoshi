I don't see how bitcoin really changes this situation.  Some banks are responsible and some push every legal loophole they can find and some that aren't legal.  
If a bank's books look good due to a high reserve ratio, but they are loaded down with a lot of off balance sheet liabilities the bank can still fail.  Just because bitcoin records transactions on a public ledger doesn't mean a bank can't hide liabilities with toxic derivatives, SPVs and other financial shenanigans.  
There are a lot of things bitcoin is good at and I'm a fan, but it's good to keep in mind that it's not a silver bullet.  Fraud existed before bitcoin and I assure you it will exist after.

I don't see why banks couldn't lend out bitcoin the same way  they lend out the USD or other currencies.  If you have bitcoins you could deposit them in a bank and earn interest while the bank lends out your bitcoins to borrowers. 
In the old days people would deposit gold and silver at banks and the banks would issue deposit slips/IOUs that often traded as paper currency for convenience.  Today, since bitcoins are so easily traded there's no reason they couldn't lend out the actual bitcoins.  You could easily secure the loans with collateral such as real estate just like you do with dollars.
If you are hoping bitcoin will kill fractional reserve lending, I don't see this being the case.

How can thebitcoinexchange afford to sell BTC at above market prices?
From their site: "We tend to offer you the best bitcoin price when you sell bitcoins. At least 1% above all other markets." 
Is there a money laundering angle here?  How can they sell above market?  Anyone know who these guys are?  I can't find any info on their site (official company name, licenses, place of domicile, etc.)
Regarding BTC-e, this is well known for difficulty to get USD into.  They don't accept US citizens as customers and don't take deposits from US banks - hence the low price to cover cost of getting USD deposited there.

Why is this upvoted so many times?  This is about the least interesting thing about Bitcoin that I can think of. zzzz

I looked into this recently.  BTC-e price for BTC/USD is low due to the difficulty of funding accounts there in USD.  They won't open accounts for American citizens or accept transfers from US banks.  Basically, the BTC/USD discount reflects the costs of getting USD to the exchange.

Goatmoo, how do you get USD to BTC-e?  I'm an American and they won't open accounts for US citizens or take deposits from US banks.

Altruistic tip or did the NSA find a good Tor compromise so now they want to ensure people keep using it?
