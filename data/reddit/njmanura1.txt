It's just a fun way of thinking what I did, I know its looking silly. What I understand by shorting is you borrow something you don't have and sell it and later rebuy it at a lower price.

And thare are nearly 4 mil lost coins. Exchanges discover price using few millions and most trade OTC. So price could go insane if there is enough interest.

Lot of sell pressure above, we may go down. If you look macro, we are clearly in a descending triangle. This pump from 3900 to 5000 was initiated by coordinated three 7000 BTC pumps in three exchanges to make a massive short sqeeze. So whatever the narrative e.g. global recession, safe heaven asset, this pump is unnatural and bound to fail. Let's see how long will this go.

This is not what I am saying, be prepared and have cash so there is a possibility that bitcoin will drop. Nothing goes straight line to 200k.

Nano s is good for holding coins as it's difficult to spend them. Nano X has a battery and which would make it unreliable. Batteries die, batteries leak and batteries short circuit. So nano s is the best, nowadays you need only one app that's bitcoin.

If you are bakked do you want your customers take bitcoins at the top or at the bottom.

Have to agree, but having a descending triangle and need of a phone made me sell some of bitcoins.
@_date: 2019-09-07 03:23:25
You can live on your world mate and buy bitcoins while I am selling.

In six months probably halving fomo will kick in and price will go through roof,  remind in two months. We will be scratching 7000  -8000 level.

Interest is cost of money, so when the cost of bitcoin goes up I pay interest. If it's going down then it's negative interest, by the don't use filthy language.

It's a software and it's developing, as prof saffdeen says paying bitcoin for coffee is like going to next block with a concord. It's the final layer of settlement and it's as secure as it is. Paying for everyday stuff will develop as second layer solutions. You can take fiat as a second layer solution now due to f***" up monetary system. Park your wealth in bitcoin and spend small amounts as you go. As Andreas antonopolis says this is difficult to grasp in developed countries, but I can grasp it very well as I am living in third world country and my government is f***** me up everyday. So I park my wealth in bitcoin. Slowness of the bitcoin network is not a big it's a feature so every block has best chance to sync in a global decentralised network.

Just wait till this descending triangle breaks.

You can buy cheap bitcoins. That's why.

I am investing 100$ a month + bonuses and other non essential allowances that I get into bitcoin, glad I got my research allowance right at the 3200$ level. Now taken a loan from BTC holding at 12000 and paying back into the holding in monthly for six months. With bitcoin you are the bank right. Now it's negative interest, but don't know how long it will last, may be has to pay hefty interest later. LOL

It's much less than 18 mil considering lost coins

But what interesting is she is as n assistant director of central bank and we may not face same concequennces as India we which is India, who knows

Make them the option to use it real world such as international money transfer then they will realize, bitcoin cannot be teached it should be learned.

 this was all over the news and YouTube.

Same logic applies to stocks, gold and other tradable stuff.

The research article conveniently omitted that bitcoin is software and it keeps evolving, when fees become high then second layer solutions come, eventually block size may increase, taproot, shnorr signatures may allow more transactions per block.
