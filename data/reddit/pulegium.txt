Contactless payment is instantaneous, I doubt it's possible to make anything even faster than that. And it's not only in US, been using it in UK for a while now:

BTC still dropping, ETH as well, but why is BTC cash going up??...

She decided that she'll try "this bitcoin" thing, and I helped her setting up BitBuy (which was super easy, just a small php widget on the side and item code in custom fields).
She also "enabled" Bitcoin payment on [her Etsy shop]( Unfortunately that's a bit clunky, it seems that the way to do this is just by adding a message "Accepting Bitcoins" and tagging all items with "bit coin" tag. It'd be great if Etsy added Bitcoin support natively...

This pack doesn't seem to include Raspberry Pi, it's just cables, power supply, case, etc.

and I'm at 0.089, so nearly 0.1!!! :)
(before anyone asks, it's mostly bitcoinget and bitvisitor money when they were handing out more (only 1.1-8uBTC for a click these days...))

Bitstamp has been like a yoyo in the last two days.

Thank you!!
She can ship to US as well, and if you use "usual" payment methods the shipping charges will be calculated automatically (we use e-shop plugin).
Unfortunately BitPay only allows one shipping/handling charge, and currently the charge is only for shipping to the UK. But if anyone needs anything shipped to US, or anywhere else, just drop an email via contact form and we'll be happy to arrange that!
She's only a reseller of these products.

Sorry, but I don't understand what you're talking about. when I click on your link ( I end up on a page that says "Budget Pack for Raspberry Pi (Does not include Raspberry Pi)" and the price for the kit is $44.95.
Maybe you wanted to post  which is 79.95, includes RaspberryPi and is cheaper than 100??
