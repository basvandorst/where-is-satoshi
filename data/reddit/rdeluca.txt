Wow if this isn't his alt account I don't know what is.
Not like these are high concept or well drawn comics. Literally hundreds of other people do these for free and better, kinda sad begging for something I could whip up in &lt;30 mins.

OOoooooh hard times have fallen on you. Sorry coinbutt.
@_date: 2014-01-06 20:30:18
Yes, obviously there's 0 risk and anyone who has US dollars are stupid.
Clearly, there's no reason to have any cash in anything other than bitcoins.

Pol Pot made history too. Doesn't mean it's a good thing.

Pretty sure bitcoinbot has a one time karma-&gt;btc exchange. You should check it out.

I'm saying they should put that second program up on the website to prove that a computer is generally more efficient at "random" number generation. Otherwise what's the point in using a computer generated number rather than a human generated number?
It's not proving anything other than the pattern recognition software he wrote is good.
@_date: 2014-01-15 17:16:06
It doesn't prove anything to me without another program by the side that has a computer "randomly" generate a list of numbers for the guesser program to guess.

I'm crazy *and* a jerk and you sent him a dime.
Such a good counter argument, thanks for responding.
@_date: 2014-01-08 19:24:28
Well I wasn't talking about you dickhead robot. 
Now flip me a coin. Heads I upvote you tails I downvote you.

Please tell me this part is also joking/being facetious.
@_date: 2014-01-06 18:22:10
So because a computer has a 50% chance of guessing which is only greater after pattern recognition is implemented that proves something?
@_date: 2014-02-27 11:53:02
I always wondered that...
@_date: 2014-02-03 22:02:27








That has totally happened before.
@_date: 2014-03-21 17:41:07
OH! .1 btc. 
My god I thought you meant ten cents. Okay. Well keep on keeping on. Hahah :)
@_date: 2014-02-03 22:09:00


That's clearly that is inclusive of more than cases where SPECIFICALLY: 
A manager points to a person who doesn't work at the business as the person you're supposed to pay, and then realizes that it wasn't the right person.
That's what we're discussing. Not people who have been robbed in restaurants.

I'm willing to buy users gold in exchange for bitcoins...
@_date: 2011-08-16 16:09:43
Wow, finally a way that I won't be scared out of my mind to try.
@_date: 2011-08-16 18:16:06
Definitely, half the 'easier' ways are based entirely of trust of the other person, and the more difficult ways take weeks. I'll be investing as soon as I get back to my laptop. Thanks again :)

I love spray paint art. There's a ton of really good spray painters that I watch in Victoria, Canada. I finally went and ordered a piece - it's a space painting, with ripples on planets made with newspaper crumbled. and white stars with just spritzing a tiny bit. 
Where/how'd you learn to spray paint picture make? (Or if you've already told this story, can you link me?)

Even if it is there's still soap enough to make another bubble.

So HE is the one who crashed the market.
@_date: 2013-04-18 18:24:52
Yeah, so much utility when no-one can buy them.
@_date: 2013-11-07 03:12:48
Every time I come here I get really excited and open a bunch of tabs, then find out it's really really hard to buy bitcoins then close all my tabs and forget about it.
Maybe I'm just dumb - easy way to buy/get bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-04-18 18:27:02
Now *that's* capitalism!
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:00:30
(it's okay I'm bitter too)
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:29:55
Exactly. With his bad luck he bought at 1k and crashed it.
Goddamn him. (it's a joke!)
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:18:00
Hmmm... penny for your thoughts? I'm bullish on them.
@_date: 2013-11-11 00:37:21
Alright I'll be the one to ask - 
Why? Why all the security etc why does your wallet need to be generated on a non-internet linked pc? Why does that even work, how does it know it's generating you a unique code?  
I'm really confused as to what this point of all this stuff is?
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:14:40
Why shouldn't I be afraid to send you my name, address, and copy of an ID, along with another form of ID that locates me.
I'm just far too paranoid to send all that stuff seems so damn fishy.
@_date: 2013-11-27 02:59:24


Yup. Greed is greed my friend
@_date: 2013-11-27 02:37:58


Oh shit, don't drink the koolaid

It's "news" because he wants to buy cheap ltc
@_date: 2013-11-27 02:57:04
If you send me 2 btc I'll go beat the guy up and get your 2 btc back.
I also have a very cheap bridge in Brooklyn.
