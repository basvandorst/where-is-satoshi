Why are you going around crypto subreddits denigrating people for their interest in crypto? Why are you a fed ass licker? Jesus Christ, spineless fucks like you need to go back into your mommies basement.

I don't care about the tech or community. I care about moon missions. 
Put that $100 on STR. You will make serious profit. I promise.

Or you could have a baby like a normal human being.

Have a father that cares about you. Don't have children if you're a gambler/smoker. I can't tell you the pain I've suffered.
Don't go to college if your parents are shit heads and never saved for your tuition. I have student debt.

Oh man.. the sell off is going to be fucking HUGE. This long of an ATM can't be sustained. I'm not saying this for reverse psychology.

To me, it seems like everyone is making money all the time, especially in the past 5 months. I'm very jealous but know I will never have anything remotely close to what you have. I might comeback in a few years. I hope that I still have time to make a moon mission then.

And when you run out of things to say about your goofy block chain, you will understand that bitcoin doesn't work without electricity.

In all seriousness, when is it going to crash? Please be serious. It has crashed many times before.

Your first statement wasn't a complete sentence. The USD can function without electricity because it is printed currency. That answered your first question. Your second statement wasn't a question. It's designed to insult me. Keeping a shoe box with your money is nothing to be ashamed about. Lastly, you're telling me to read a book when you can't even punctuate properly. 
But please, read my comment history like everyone else and nit pick me there, because that's your last resort.
