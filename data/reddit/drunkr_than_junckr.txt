I don't think debit is an option on the pro, but I could be wrong. It seems like i had to bank transfer as well ( or wire) but the bank transfer was a 7 day hold as well.

That's not what I'm saying. 
 Fiat - Work job, make money - pay taxes, buy item with cash. 
 btc - work job, make money, pay taxes. buy btc. buy item, pay taxes. 
I am not even interested at that point whether I am operating at a loss or a gain, I am being fucking robbed.

It's just simply sad that such an enticing and forward thinking method of trade was so utterly extinguished.  Why pay double taxes with btc, when you can just pay taxes once with the fiat we earned?

I suppose I could be convinced to purchase with btc, and deal with entailing headache, if a significant discount was taken into consideration for using BTC. 
Otherwise, it is certainly more of a hassle, with less reward.
