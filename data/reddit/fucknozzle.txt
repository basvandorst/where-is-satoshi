You're not likely to be suing them now, you do that to claim damages for some harm that has been done.  I'm not saying having your money locked up isn't harmful, but right now there's no way to quantify what damage has been caused, so this is not the time for a suit.
You would be looking to take action to force them to release your money. How and whether you can do that depends on the terms of your contract with them (which would be what is written in their terms and conditions) - so that's the first thing you want your lawyer to see.
Presumably being a US company (is that correct?) it shouldn't be as difficult as it would if they were in some shady jurisdiction. 
If you're clean, there should be no reason for them to continue holding your funds, and absent any dirty clauses in the terms, a court should take a pretty dim view of what they are doing.
After that, you might sue for damages.

In the last 7 days, it has traded between 320 and 380. That's a 20% range. In a week.

There's so much wrong with this.
Why would people flee from FIAT?
Why would they look at Bitcoin, which by your reckoning will be in dire short supply, and think they'd rather use that than dollars, Euros and pounds?
Give me a reason why my mother or my sister will see Bitcoin as being better than FIAT. Just one.
This is such wooly thinking. You're overlooking a very simple economic truth - when demand increases, the value of something is only increased when there is no alternative. There is an alternative to Bitcoin that is cheaper to use, simpler to use, and has about a 2,000 year headstart on Bitcoin.
What makes you think the world is going to drop that in favour of a scarce and complicated 'alternative' I can't imagine.
Oh, and 'fundamentally' replace? As opposed to what - 'superficially' replace?

You'd need to look at the terms you carefully read when you signed up, to see where in fact the company is domiciled. 
Just because it operates in one country doesn't mean it's regulated there, or is subject to that jurisdiction. 
Lots of the early shady Bitcoin companies were domiciled in places like Bulgaria. Good luck trying to take any action against one of those when it all goes wrong.

Seems a bit odd to call it 'Manhattan-like', when there were actually projects dedicated to code-breaking. 
I suppose as an American, it wouldn't feel right to call it a 'Bletchley park-like' project, although the Americans were heavily involved in that.

@_date: 2015-12-19 07:17:55
While I think that is an excellent answer, my point was that you can't assume any of that. 
The very first stumbling block when you're looking to recover with something as borderless as bitcoin is jurisdiction. If you can't show that the courts in your country have the right to hear claims, they will not touch it. 
All it takes is a simple clause stating a different governing law and it's almost certainly hopeless. 
Your point about Interac transfers is god though - that may as you say give some route of attack, but whether that's true or not, if you're giving any substantial amont of money to someone, it's the kind of thing you need to know before you send it, not after it all goes to shit.

Sell orders? 
Anyway . . .
It's not hard to see what would happen to the price if someone tried to buy a million bitcoins in one go. It'd go, um, to the moon. 
Then as soon as they stopped buying, it would shit the bed.
But then if they bought it all, it would have no value. What good is a currency if only one party has any of it? It's not like silver or gold, that people actually need.
Then you consider that even buying at insane volumes that could kill the whole market, they'd still only be buying a tiny scrap of what their reserves need to be, it's never going to happen. It's just not big enough to be played in that way.

@_date: 2014-07-30 12:27:36
You're overanalysing it.
Fact, if you can make money from it, so can they. Banks are entirely capable of doing exactly what you do, which is buy and sell bitcoins.
Why they're not trying to do that is because a) as you say, it's very small. and b) banks look at risks before they get into any kind of business. Bitcoin is risky, both from a simple numbers point of view, and as a reputation risk.
Bitcoin can easily be 'interfaced' with other financial services. It's just another currency.
You can be sure all the banks know exactly what bitcoin is, know exactly how it works and have made a conscious decision on whether or not to trade it.
@_date: 2014-10-17 13:26:04
The OP didn't define it that way.
I understand Bitcoin as an instrument perfectly well. I couldn't give you chapter and verse of the technical aspects though, but if you're insisting on that, you exclude pretty much everybody. 
But then that's probably what you are trying to do. If you can't answer someone, tell them they wouldn't understand. Oh, and downvote them of course.

The average consumer doesn't care if the price is going up, down or sideways.
If they need to use Bitcoin to pay for something, they just need to buy Bitcoin to that value and send it. Whether that's 1 bitcoin at $400, or two at $200 each doesn't make any difference.
This is because 'the average consumer' and someone who is going to 'get into Bitcoin', are two completely different things. 
The real issue of course is whether the average consumer often (or ever) actually needs to use Bitcoin. As things stand now, the answer is almost overwhelmingly no. That'll only really happen when a retailer accepts nothing but Bitcoin, which would be suicidal, and I can't see any reason why it would ever happen.

@_date: 2014-10-14 10:01:33
Right. What you're describing is a bubble.
The price rise is based solely on what other people are doing, not on any fundamentals.
And as soon as there is any significant selling, which of course there will be because there are no fundamental reasons to be buying, the whole thing comes crashing back down. Each time a little (or a lot) lower.
This probably isn't going to end well. Again.

Yeah, Dubai is really remote. Do you guys even have phones?
@_date: 2014-09-16 08:21:35
Yup. In terms of how many units you can divide it into, that's exactly right. 
But the price is not static. 
Remember, the discussion is about there being a limited supply (which we have now agreed there isn't), and I believe the inference was that a limited supply has an effect on price.
It doesn't, because Bitcoins are not objects with any utility, they are simply holding a value which can be exchanged for things with value.
You guys should try to keep up. I understand most people reading this have no clue either, and enjoy seeing you mobbing someone who doesn't stick to the 'to the moon' argument, but in the end what will decide this argument is the price you will get for your bitcoins next month, or next year.
Let's see. One thing you can be sure of, it won't be based on any shortage of bitcoins.

@_date: 2014-09-15 13:00:13
You misunderstand entrapment.
A cop is perfectly at liberty to try and get someone to do something illegal. Offering to sell something or buy something from someone is not automatically entrapment.
It becomes entrapment when the offer becomes the reason the person committed the illegal act.
If a cop offers to buy 3 grams of coke from you for $150, and you sell it to him you'll get busted. If he offers you $10,000 for it, it's likely you'd get away with it, as there is no proof you'd have done the same thing for $150.
The test is, would the person do what he did under normal circumstances. Selling coke for $50/g is normal criminal behavior. Selling it for 3 grand/g is not.
@_date: 2014-10-29 15:20:16
I think you've wandered off on a tangent here.
I'm not reading anything into a chart, and I'm not trying to predict the future price of Bitcoin in any way.
What I'm saying is that when the volume of transactions has increased, but the total value of transactions hasn't, it must mean the value of each individual transaction has decreased. It's basic arithmetic.

It's just common sense, the UK is a major financial hub, there's no significant cost in bringing digital currency into it's business activities.
@_date: 2014-09-24 16:17:43
Some places you can't pay with cash, like online. 
I don't know any places that charge more for cards than they do cash, so I'm going to say that's not correct.
When I'm buying online, it's invariably because it's cheaper than I could buy for in a store. With cash.
@_date: 2014-12-17 16:12:44
But there is no correct value for Bitcoin, other than a nominal and not necessarily very large value. It's not correcting, it's dying.
As a payment system, they work just fine at US$5 each. There's no need for them to have a floating value at all.
That's just speculation, and it's only logical that as the speculators leave the market, nobody is left who wants to play pump and dump.
So, as people holding them slowly realise there's no reason for the price to go beserk, they sell them.
A market slowly fizzling out over the course of a year or two is exactly what you'd expect to see if that was happening.

@_date: 2014-07-30 14:10:46
Fine, I agree, and if you understand that, you're good. Most transactions are an exchange of some sort.
My worry is that people with less experience are having the reality obscured. To them, maybe, an exchange is the CBOT or NYSE, where if something goes wrong, the bad guy gets lead off the floor by a security guard, and everybody gets their money back.
What you're really dealing with could be someone with a PC running Linux and apache, in their basement in a small and legally unreachable country, watching you unload your life savings onto their hard drive.
That's only half of the exchange - you've gotta get what you paid for.
Big difference. It should be clear what exactly is happening, and calling it an exchange doesn't promote transparency.
@_date: 2014-09-08 09:47:46
No, because the total value of every existing bitcoin on the planet is about the same as 8 hours of global oil production. It is not big enough to bother government, banks or oil producers in any way.
Daily volume of bitcoin transactions is less than the global forex trade in Vietnamese dong.
It'd need to be worth 100 x what it is for anyone to even notice it in economic terms, and I'm sure you'll argue it's going to be worth that one day. Improbable.

@_date: 2014-10-28 15:00:10
So how do they pay for things online?
@_date: 2014-11-05 09:24:35
You have to consider the context. The price doesn't matter, and it does matter.
- I'm a buyer or a seller of something using Bitcoin. The thing I'm trading is valued at $100. Today, I need to buy/sell 0.3 bitcoins to cover my trade. I do that at the time I buy/sell the object. 
I don't care whether it was 0.3 bitcoins, or 3.0 bitcoins. The price doesn't matter. I traded $100 of bitcoin.
- Now I am just trading Bitcoin. I buy 0.3 bitcoins for $100. I am going to keep them. The price does matter. 
As a trading instrument, the price matters. As a commercial instrument, it doesn't.
You have to separate the two. 
Don't expect large scale adoption by commercial businesses to have any predictable effect on price, because the people using it simply don't care what the price is. They will only care about liquidity.
@_date: 2014-09-24 15:39:05

Well, it's a term used in a lot of markets. If you weren't just throwing in 'big' words that you think make you sound like you're an expert, you'd already know the definition.
It's broadly speaking a way to look at the variance of returns over a given time using statistical analysis. 
Bitcoins has spikes, but long term it tends to sit doing nothing at all, and shows low volatility.
@_date: 2014-10-15 08:21:14

@_date: 2014-09-08 12:49:56
No they weren't. That's why the internet is so pervasive. It makes all of those things easier.
Bitcoin replaces nothing. It's just another form of something we already have, and isn;t any easier or meaningfully superior.
My 'money' may not be 100% secure (to anticipate what is usually the next answer), but then hundreds of thousands of bitcoins have gone walkies in the last year too.
@_date: 2014-07-30 08:47:48
It's obvious that's what's going on. That's why the market hasn't moved for months, there is almost no liquidity.
What is going on is that the speculators that caused the big shifts in the market at the beginning of the year aren't there any more. They've either cashed out, or lost their money.
What remains is a hardcore of bitcoin fans who are sitting on their bitcoins, waiting for someone to start trading. Well, if they're not trading, who are they expecting to do it?
It's like someone who sits waiting for traffic to move, not realising they're actually behind a parked car.
@_date: 2014-09-19 15:07:21
If they have no value at all, then the mechanism is simply redundant. 
What the OP seems to be saying is that the existence of the mechanism somehow gives value to Bitcoins. 
OK, so the existence of a working mechanism implies the bitcoins must have SOME value, but that could be one cent each.
It does not mean Bitcoin has to have any particular value, and it's basically an ass-backward argument.

That's not the point. Stop obsessing about the price.
Does it help if I say A) is wide acceptance, but they're worth a million bucks each, or B and they're worth eleventy trillion each?
A specific value isn't the point. The question is do you prefer wide acceptance and low value, or very little acceptance and a high value? What this is really asking is whether you like it as a payment system, or as something to make money from.
You can say both, but at that point I'll give up and let you do your own thing.

This is correct.
It is not the UK trying to grab control of bitcoin, it is the UK doing what it always does - looking to be a major player in the financial markets.
We've had similar discussions here before. Some people believe banks will try to break bitcoin, as they are scared of the competition. Their 'proof' is that banks have not enthusiastically pumped bitcoin.
The fact is, Bitcoin has not been significant enough for them to want to get involved. What is happening now is that on a government level, people are asking whether that is actually the right choice.
It's 50/50 as to whether they run with it, or ban it. It's unlikely they'll do nothing.
@_date: 2014-07-15 11:00:56
You don't have exchanges. You have websites where you may be able to trade bitcoins.
Exchanges are regulated, and are required to be financially (and legally) responsible for the transactions that they conduct.
These websites are pretty much unregulated. You have no idea who is running them, which jurisdiction they operate in, and who to contact if anything goes wrong.
Bitcoin scams are still alive because the people who trade bitcoins put them into scam operations.
@_date: 2014-09-11 08:33:00
Good point, and even worse, as I'm British.
I need to slow down with the septic trolling for a while.
@_date: 2014-08-07 15:33:54
That's not likely. Bitcoin really is a tiny operation.
The volume of bitcoin traded is less than one millionth of the global forex trade, at the moment.
The market cap is 0.25% of the US gold reserve - which itself is a pretty insignificant part of the US's 'value'. 
That's every bitcoin that exists, at todays value.
Again, this is why you see little liquidity. Lots of posters here seem to think the world is shocked and awed by the towering might of bitcoin, and should be trading it like hot cakes, when in reality it's a grain of sand on a large beach.

Here's where you're wrong.
Someone who understands bitcoins doesn't necessarily see any benefits, or agree it's 'superior money'.
Truth is, most of the people who think this are the people who own bitcoins already. There are certainly a lot of people interested in them from an idealogical point of view, but a lot of them are just hoping to make a buck.
Typical Bitcoiner thinking - how can someone not be interested in something that it if goes batshit insane will make me rich? 
Well, most of us don't think it's going to go batshit insane. It's a clever system but there is no reason to think bitcoins are worth anything.

Seems posting a link to a random piece of data with no comment is kind of lazy.
It's not a very significant piece of data. A trillion dollars sound like a lot of money, but it's still only a pretty small number compared to the US GDP, and it's there because the US has a big economy and is considered good for the money.
This is about the same as someone who earns 50 grand a year racking up a $2,000 overdraft on their bank account.

And there it is.
The system that Bitcoin uses is useful. This has no bearing on the value. Bitcoin works whether it's 0.10 or 1,000 for anyone just doing fiat &gt; Bitcoin &gt; Fiat, which is almost all of them.
Two different things, something all the big swinging dick traders should bear in mind when they are surprised that every announcement of people using Bitcoin is not followed by a thousand dollar hike in the price.
@_date: 2014-09-18 15:09:03
Why do people get excited when someone agrees to take your bitcoins for nothing? That's not even the case here. Nobody has agreed anything, but you're excited by the idea that someone might.
What do you imagine the evaluation process actually is? I ask because it's obvious to me;
"Hey, these people want to give you bitcoins"
"What are they? Are they worth anything?"
"Yeah, you can sell them for dollars"
"OK, if they're free, why not?"
People accepting Bitcoin donations does nothing for Bitcoin. It creates no demand for them, it only ever ends up with the bitcoins being sold for cash.

@_date: 2014-08-14 13:53:23
That is not a margin call.
A margin call is made by an exchange or a broker when your account is negative, due to price movements. It will ask you to pay an amount that brings your account back to either zero, or to within a preagreed limit.
If you fail to pay the margin call, then the exchange (or the broker) may buy or sell your position themselves, to stop further losses.
That is call closing out a position. 
@_date: 2014-10-01 08:40:11
Do you understand what market cap(italisation) actually is?
It's the number of things in circulation, multiplied by their price. BTC is currently around $5 billion - about 14 million coins, x 380.
Putting aside the artificial limit on the number of coins there can be, the 'system' works whether the market cap is 1 million or 1 trillion. It's simply a mechanism, and the price of bitcoins makes no difference to how it works.
Unless you mean there is a point at which the price of bitcoin is so low that people stop using them, and therefore stop using the system. That's moot, it doesn't mean the system doesn't work, it means the bitcoins are useless.
The answer to that one is probably the price can go very low indeed. If all you're doing is buying bitcoin spot and immediately transferring them to cover an equivalent fiat value, you don't really care what the price of them is. So long as you can buy enough to cover your immediate needs, it doesn't matter.
That's something I have said more than once. Bitcoin can function just as well for 90% of the people who want to use it at any price. We're onto the argument that is cropping up more and more frequently now - the only people with any interest at all in a high price are the people who own cheap bitcoins.
There are relatively few of them, and they're starting to understand why when they spout about how bitcoin is actually worth (insert absurd number), people keep asking why.

You think people won't read your terms of service, so it doesn't matter what they say?
They're legally binding on both sides, regardless of whether you just pasted the first thing you found in a Google search into them.
You might be right - a lot of users don't read TOS, but anyone smelling a rat sure will, and when you a) claim things quoted from them weren't in them, when they were, and b) dismiss that by saying the TOS are just a boilerplate (i.e. you don't even know what's in them yourself, let alone understand them), you're telling them you have no clue what you're doing, at best.
tl;dr, yeah, shady as fuck.

It doesn't have a fixed supply, the 'coins' are divisible. The supply is fixed in the same way as a companies shares are fixed. They start the company with X shares, then split them.
Companies split stocks, Bitcoins divide. There is effectively a limitless supply, and the 21 million coin limit becomes completely irrelevant.
@_date: 2014-10-29 15:05:34
No, it isn't.
It spikes when the market spikes.
@_date: 2014-11-12 11:17:43
No it isn't.
A long term investor will look at volatility. He will decide on the level of risk he wants to take, and he will decide whether to invest based on those two factors.
The volatility will be measured short term. Anything more than a few months ago is meaningless. The last 12 months in Bitcoin have been very volatile, so any serious investor will call it high risk.
There are investors who will like that, and will take a punt. They're pretty much just gamblers. Most investors, certainly long term ones won't touch it with a barge pole.
The historic price means nothing. You can stick your fingers in your ears and keep saying it does, but it doesn't.

This is a typical Bitcoiners greed driven mentality. Someone comes up with an idea that (in your opinion, which is worth fuck all) will make a lot of money.
You think you have the right to a slice of that? Why?
Here's how it works; go get your own funding, set up your own company, run it better than they run theirs, and you could trouser that billion bucks. 
Of course what you'll do is give shares of it to anyone that wants them. People power and decentralisation. Right on brother.
@_date: 2014-09-10 10:23:17
Um, they confirmed.
@_date: 2014-09-25 20:35:11
Fair enough. 
Maybe it's not clear where I'm coming from though. I'm a sceptic, and I think that a lot of people are cheerleading Bitcoin from what seems to be an idealistic view, when in reality they just want it to go to 5 grand so they can cash in and buy themselves a condo.
So the Linux comparison work to a point, but remember you're asking the question of people who are telling you Linux is the best damn OS in the world, and everything else is shit. 
I expected so see mainly A's. I suspect in reality there are a lot of B's with A written on their hats. I also suspect there are just as many zealots who actually own no coins, but that's got nothing to do with the thread.
If I'd written this at the beginning, the thread would just have been downvoted to oblivion and would have been a waste of time. To be honest, I don't even know if what I'm writing here will appear in the thread or just goes to you, Reddit can be confusing . . . 
I'm interested to know what people say. The argument could have been about anything, I know half the time I'm talking out of my ass, it's obvious an unlimited supply of anything has little value - why buy it when you can pull it out of your butt . . . it's just a good way to get the tards frothing.
@_date: 2014-09-15 16:11:23
That's not what we're talking about. The point made was that Bitcoin has a fixed supply. 
Presumably that point was supposed to mean that there was some value in there being a limited supply, but as there is no limit, there's no value.
Plus, limited supply doesn't automatically mean increased value. My dog can only shit about half a pound a day, but I can't sell an ounce of the stuff.
Actually, there's an easier way of dealing with the post we're talking about. He says limited supply is Bitcoin's "primary value proposition". Fumbling and fucking around like that for a complicated way of saying something simple is a very reliable indicator that he hasn't got a clue. There's a lot of that in this forum. 
@_date: 2014-09-11 11:21:14
Bitcoins come with tons of fees if you use them outside of their system.

Well, banks do let people do that.
They will look to see if someone is creditworthy. If they are, they will allow that person to build up debt. A mortgage is one example, but there are a lot of people around with a years salary in credit card debt, loans, finance etc.
The banks look at credit ratings. The USA also has a credit rating, and they can borrow against that. 
So, this isn't such big news. Many countries do this.

That's just babble.
I need a coke because I'm thirsty.
I need bitcoin because, um, well I don't. 
So, I have choices; 
1. Get Bitcoin, which I don't need, from an exchange. Takes time, effort and as we know, often results in some little douchebag running off with my money. Nope, that's not happening.
2. Get bitcoin from an ATM, and pay 7% commission. Not happening either.
This is bad, right? I have no way to buy Bitcoin without doing something I don't want to do. Let me think, how do we solve this?
Oh, got it! I'll use cash or a credit card. Both are immediately available, universally accepted, and cost me nothing. Added bonus, they take about 15 seconds per transaction, tops.

They must be linked to some exchange site.
Assuming they're not taking any price risk, that's about the only way to do it. Prices are not set by any kind of mechanism, they're set by buyers and sellers making bids and offers.
If there was any big difference between coinbase prices and prices elsewhere, you'd have people arbitraging, where they buy on one and sell simultaneously on the other, pocketing the difference.
That's the theory, anyway. Delays/uncertainties in getting trades done and confirmed would have an effect, but the simple fact is, it's buyers vs sellers.
@_date: 2014-08-08 08:08:33
Again, I think you overestimate the impact that bitcoin is having.

Bitcoin won't grow like that because it doesn't need to.
It is as useful to people trading fiat-btc-fiat (which seems to be about 90% of them) at $2 as it is at $2,000. They have no interest in it being worth anything other than what they need to make a transaction.

If I have a fixed supply of whole units, but can divide them effectively limitlessly, they are effectively limitless.
I have in mind they can be divided to 8 decimal places. so, each coin can become 800,000,000 units. If you have 21,000,000 coins, that's a fucking lot of bitbits. 16 quintillion, give or take, if that's even a real number.

The hating is just a very predictable result of the obnoxious dickwaving that consumed half of the internet for most of December 2013.
Few of the haters ever had any interest in Bitcoin at all, but were pretty much dragged into it by all the dorks crapping up every discussion with 'hey, look how much money I'm making!!! You suck, you're poor!!".
It's like the guy at a dinner party who keeps butting in and talking about how much money he's made on his house.
What you are seeing is schadenfreude. Every one you pissed off a year ago is absolutely delighted to see your magical funbux slowly but unstoppably disappearing down the shitter.

OK. I'm trying to avoid getting bogged down in the 'to the moon' arguments, as the question doesn't need to resolve that.

What you need to understand about 'leverage' is that it amplifies the profits and losses you can make.
If you have $100 in a market, and it moves 10%, you win or lose $10. That's 10% of your cash.
If you have an agreement with a broker or an exchange that you only need to put up 10% of the cash, which is an example of what leveraged trading is, that 10% swing means you make or lose 100% of what you put in.

Not honouring your agreements isn't fraud. It is a breach that allows the injured party to bring a contract to a close and seek compenation for any losses in a commercial agreement, or to sue in tort in a civil context.

You can call it nitpicking, but it's actually a fundamental problem with bitcoiners.
What you all do is use long words and phrases to make it look like you are experts. To most of the rest of the readers, you do, and off they go and repeat what they've heard, so they sound like experts too.
Problem is, a lot of the time you have no idea what you're saying, you just think it sounds good. So eventually, the whole and subs are full of clueless neckbeards spouting total garbage at each other.
It's kind of amusing. I particularly enjoy the 'margin call' one. They make it sound like it's some kind of explosive device, when it's a simple administrative function, which real traders deal with pretty much every day.

But in purely economic terms, there is no reason for them to have any more than a token value. They can be fixed.
If all they are needed for is as a secure and anonymous alternative to fiat transactions, where one party buys them then transfers them to someone who immediately sells them, all that is required is a nominal value.
All the users are concerned about is liquidity. So long as they can buy or sell $X worth of them for the required FIAT amount, they don't care what the price is. 
You only have to make sure there are enough of them in circulation to provide enough liquidity. If you don't you're not going to find that they become more valuable, you're going to find people simply won't use them.
What the argument for value as a result of scarcity boils down to is the following - people see no reason for them to be worth $1,000, so they will not pay that for them. 
@_date: 2014-06-27 14:24:57

That graph is massively misleading. The scale moves exponentially.
Look at the difference between January and now - it looks kind of flat, but in fact it has dropped from $39 million to $3.7 million. That's more than a 90% drop.

Even if they were accepting Bitcoin directly, it's never going to amount to a significant part of their revenue.
Dell and MS between them have revenues of over $140 billion. 
Looking at the only big company who published any numbers - Overstock estimated sales of about $6 - $8 million in Bitcoin for 2014, against a turnover of $1.4 billion. 
That's 0.5%. Nobody would really pay much attention if a company took a risk on such a small part of their revenue. If they lost it altogether, maybe, but they're probably far more exposed to fiat currencies than they will be to Bitcoin.
Bitcoin users are starting to get notorious for badgering sellers into accepting Bitcoin, and then never spending anything with them. It's clear they're just hoping everybody else will pump the price up.

But it isn't fixed. There is already an almost infinite supply. Adding to that supply will have very little effect, when the existing supply is effectively limitless.
You're seriously confused. The number of bitcoins in circulation now or in the future has absolutely no bearing whatsoever on it's value or volatility. Bitcoin value is driven 10% by demand, 90% by sentiment, and zero percent by supply.
Nobody who understands even the most basic rules of markets will look at the mined/unmined and final cap on numbers and think of the value in terms of supply. Not a single one of them.

I think it's unlikely they're having their positions closed. I don't think the bitcoin 'exchanges' work that way, because they're not actually exchanges, they're just trading sites. I don't really know though.
I'd imagine people are just avoiding further losses. If you are prepared to lose a certain amount, as the price gets to that level you sell. 
Some people will have placed orders at lower levels so that this is done automatically as the market reaches that level. That's called a stop loss order, and as the name suggests, it's done to stop you from losing more than you are willing to lose.
Some people will sit and watch the market go against them indefinitely. They can't bring themselves to believe it's not about to turn around. Google Nick Leeson for a good example.

@_date: 2014-12-09 10:29:05
This just proves again what we already knew.
Bitcoiners are desperate for people to accept Bitcoin, because they think this will increase the value of the Bitcoin they own.
They never spend their own Bitcoins, they expect everybody else to do it.
We saw it when Canberra buses started accepting Bitcoin. It was used 20 times, in 5 months. When they took the app down for maintenance, they received 30 emails complaining. People complained that had never used the service.
Same with Mozilla. People are badgering the fuck out of Mozilla to accept Bitcoin, and now they've donated $5k. Five fucking grand? Hilarious.
What they haven't grasped is that it won't work anyway. Very basis economics tell us that wide acceptance will not have any predictable effect on price, if the vendors are immediately converting the Bitcoins to FIAT. They don't care what the price of Bitcoin is.
Large scale uptake causing any shortage of Bitcoin will not help either. People won't pay more for them, they'll revert to Fiat. Scarcity is nothing if there is an alternative.
Idiots.

We have a saying in my office, that traders always talk up their own book. It's another way of saying 'cognitive bias'.
Yup, sellers might start keeping the bitcoins, but it's just as likely they'll stop accepting them. Given the extra layer of complication they bring, where they're just facilitating extra business, there has to be a growing demand to pay in bitcoin for it to be worth the vendors while.
That's not there. You have an illiquid market, a lot of people sitting on and not spending their bitcoins. A significant part of the scarce liquidity in the market is people getting rid of their bitcoin sales proceeds.
Just because you want it to take off, doesn't mean it will.

Neither are secure, we know that. Bitcoins get stolen just as often as bank accounts get hacked. 
This is a red herring, the point was that the average punter doesn't care about whether there's a bank behind the transaction or not. 
To say Bitcoin is 'vastly better than anything we currently use for financial transactions' is ridiculous. Bitcoin is more complicated to use that a Visa card or a £20 note ($20 bill if that's too taxing). Thus your average punter isn't attracted to it.

Just a heads up. The terms of service contain an arbitration clause.
This is not necessarily a bad thing where disputes are for larger sums, but it precludes any 'small claims' procedures you might have available to you.
Any court will kick your claim straight out for lack of jurisdiction, and send you off to arbitration. I can't say what that costs, but you'll likely need to fork out a significant pile of cash just to get it started.
Also note, you have 90 days from the time a dispute arises to get the arbitration going. After that you'll be timebarred, you won't be able to claim anything.
tl;dr - dispute resolution terms are possibly unsuitable for smaller organizations / individuals.

I'm still pretty doubtful that this is attractive to either the retailer or the buyer. It's just an unnecessary complication for both of them, for little reward.
It's almost another piece of cognitive dissonance. The people who seem to think every idea that aims to promote bitcoin is fantastic are the people who own them, and have a simple financial interest in the price rising.  
They seem unable to sit back and ask whether the people with no vested interest will like the idea.
@_date: 2014-09-19 12:29:51
You have to separate the utility of bitcoin from the value of bitcoin.
Locker tokens for your local gym have utility, but no value to anybody who doesn't want a locker at your gym.
The bitcoin 'network' has utility for anybody who wants to move digital tokens between people. 
The value of bitcoins has no bearing at all on that. It works the same whether the bitcoins are worth $1 or $10,000.

One is a sloppy mess that makes you shit yourself, the other is a chain of restaurants.
@_date: 2014-09-23 12:13:08
It doesn't. It takes more than one transaction. 
How do we visualise a market . . .?
Imagine this; the sellers are standing in a queue, each person wanting a slightly higher price than the guy in front of him, increasing as you go back through the queue. 
The buyers are facing them in another queue, with the person willing to pay the highest price at the front, and each person behind him willing to pay a lower price than the person before him (it can actually be be the same price, but not higher).
The highest buyer and the lowest seller meet at the front of the queue, and trade coins for cash. It may be that one of them does not buy or sell exactly the amount he wants to trade, so he stays there until he has finished. 
As each person finishes their trade, they leave the queue, and the next person gets to the front.
If there are a lot of sellers, then they will need the queue of buyers to move faster to trade all their coins. Now, remember in the queue of buyers, each person is willing to pay slightly less than the guy before, so if the sellers still want to trade, they are going to be meeting buyers who will pay lower and lower prices.
So the market drops. 
The exact opposite will happen when there are more buyers than sellers, but that seems to be rare nowadays.
You can kind of see it in action here: 
Look on the right hand side of the page, there is a list of bids at the top, which increase as you move up. At the bottom are offers, which decrease as you move down. In the middle you can see the last trade - it is the last point at which the buyer and seller agreed the same price.
Something like that. 
The difference between the offer to sell and the bid to buy is often called the 'spread'. That word is used for several different things, so be cautious with it.
tl;dr - more sellers than buyers, market drops. More buyers than sellers, market rises.
@_date: 2014-09-11 12:25:08
Chicken and egg though.
You tell a retailer he should give a discount for bitcoin users, to increase his volume, he's going to ask for evidence.
So far, seems most people who have agreed to accept bitcoin have seen virtually no uptake at all. There are possibly a few exceptions, but as a percentage of the trade done it is absolutely tiny.
That's a tough sell. It's not likely to happen.

None. That's how the system is built.

- If the price increases. (Won't help, because you'll get yet another flood of people jumping in).

Wouldn't be an arbitration case. Decentralisation would preclude that, there is no contractual relationship between the parties in this transaction, so no arbitrator has jurisdiction.
Would be interesting to see how a court dealt with it, in the ludicrously unlikely event the OP decides to spend the $25 grand he'd need to spend to take the recipient to court. Oh, hold on, we don't know who the recipient is, do we?
Your legal case is broadly; I threw something I own down a hole, and now I want to claim it back from whoever was at the bottom of the hole and caught it, but I don't know who that was.

Fair comment. Can I open the debate a little then?
Do you really think the courts would be unable to understand Bitcoin to the extent they could not deal with claims for breach of contract? I think you are underestimating them.
It'd be nice to see someone who actually is in a position to make meaningful comments justifying what always looks like a knee jerk judgement. There are a lot of posts around here about how nobody in Wall Street is smart enough to understand it, and that's why they're not all over it, and it's obviously bullshit. 
It also occurs to me that writing an interpreting is fine, but enforcing I think is a bigger problem. Your example is 5 bitcoins, so about $2k. How often does a $2k claim actually get to a court?
I realise this could just as easily apply to a $2 million claim, but the fact is your audience here seem to be doing $100 transactions. Is it really practical to say they can chase each other through the courts for those kind of sums? What are the alternatives for small claims.
I think your reference to incorporating a definition is pretty good, by the way. 
Assuming there isn't already one around, and incorporating one from Wikipedia is risky (it can be changed by anyone, so you can't rely on it ever being 'static'), can I sincerely suggest in the course of your research you might come up with one yourself?
Another thing I wonder about, might interest you - trading sites etc (call themselves exchanges), always seems to me their terms of service are at best evasive. I have only ever seen a couple of jurisdiction clauses, one of which was Germany, the other was Bulgaria. What do you think about people entrusting their wealth to a site like that? I've said on more than one occasion I wouldn't touch it with a bargepole.

You have to deal with the negative aspects as well as the positive. 
What your Dad has probably seen is that bitcoin is used to buy and sell drugs, or that several websites have either pinched, lost or had stolen millions of dollars worth of them.
He has obviously read other people saying it's a ponzi scheme.
It doesn't matter how great you think it is, if that's all he knows about them.
You have to deal with that. You have to show that yes, people use it to trade drugs, but that's because of the anonymous nature of it. Most drug dealers use cash, does that make cash a dangerous and shady way to pay?
Yes, websites have lost bitcoins. They get shut down by the fed (see drug dealing) they go bust or blow themselves up because they're over loaded, and yup, some just steal the coins.
The same thing happens with cash. All the time. Bitcoin is valuable, so people steal it. That's no different to other scams.
But, how many big and respectable companies trade with it? As someone said, why would Dell be working with drug dealers ans scammers? They're not of course.
Tell your Dad bitcoin is still to a great extent an experiment. I'll get shit flung at me for that kind of comment, but it is. Nobody knows how it will pan out, it's the first of it's kind, or at least the first to get any traction.
If you understand what it is, you can see although it can attract dodgy elements, that's not why it exists. You need to explain to him why it exists, and leave out the flowery predictions and the 'to the moon' bullshit.
It's something that might be good, might be valuable, but isn't a scam. Anyone who thinks it's more than that is guessing, and people know when you're doing that, and will be skeptical.

@_date: 2014-09-24 16:03:43
Well, I'm seeing it like this;
You are relying on tight supply to increase the value of bitcoins. That either means holding back your bitcoins, or more people wanting them, or both.
If you hold your bitcoins to force the price up, it will effect some people. If they need bitcoins, they are going to be affected by the swings created by people holding onto their bitcoins.
If an alternative with no supply restrictions is there, they are likely to find that more attractive.
This isn't going to happen to everyone. If I need Bitcoin right now to buy something, I just buy it at whatever the market is, it doesn't matter, I'm going to spend it straight away, so I'm effectively still working in Fiat.
The logic here is where I started - the value of the bitcoin is separate from the mechanisms that allow them to function. If I need $100 worth of (whatever) coin to buy something, if I have several alternatives, one of which is harder to buy than the other, then I'll pass on that one.
If the seller takes it, I'll buy $100 of Dogecoin. Makes no difference to me.

Maybe the average poster on Reddit doesn't give a fuck about Bitcoin, and has got tired of having to read yet another evangelist turning a thread into a discussion on it.
Perhaps when people said 'stop spamming everybody with your stupid $0.04 tips', they actually meant it.
Just a thought. 
@_date: 2014-10-28 09:06:08
You miss the point, and I'm dubious about your claims anyway.
The point is, there are two entirely different types of bitcoin users.
- people who 'get into' bitcoin. Whether that is by choice or not doesn't matter. If someone is going to hold bitcoin then the price is important to them. These are not the people who are going to provide the liquidity you;re talking about. They're not spending their bitcoin, remember?
- People who just need something of value that they can exchange for goods and services. They are not holding bitcoin, so they don't care what the value of it is. They receive a value that they will consider in fiat terms. 
For the record, I doubt you can force bitcoin on people. If you sent me a 0.05btc tip, I'd ignore it, like I have for every other tip I have been sent. Send me 3 bitcoins, I'll take them, thanks. And immediately sell them.
If an employer insisted I take payment in Bitcoin, I'd set it up so that it was immediately sold. I'd only accept that the payment was a fiat equivalent, so there was no 'exchange' risk for me. The only way your approach would work is if the person is desperate for work. then they're accepting bitcoin because they have nio choice, that's not a marketing strategy that will stick.
tl;dr If your only solution to resistance to Bitcoin is to shove it down peoples throats, you've got no chance.

I have a negative view of it as an investment. The mechanics of it I'm OK with, but even there I'm not sure it's needed.
Bitcoin as a means to transfer value between two parties is fine. It seems to work, and if the two parties are not trying to fuck each other over, it's safe and reliable.
But if all I want to do is take fiat, buy bitcoin, transfer it to someone in settlement of a fiat debt, I don't give a rats ass what it's worth. I just want the value of what I'm buying, I don't care how many bit/coins that equates to.
This leads me to believe there is no rhyme or reason at all to the value of Bitcoin. I have never heard any coherent explanation of why it should be worth anything more than a token value.
This leads me to believe the only people with any interest in Bitcoin having a high value are people who own bitcoin and want to make money (or recoup losses).
In other words, it's a pump and dump.

Bitcoin is at the same price it was a year ago, give or take. Zero percent growth. Next month if the market is where it is now, it has lost 60%.
Those are the numbers people who are looking at an investment will worry about. If it's a stupid number, they'll pass on it, and Bitcoin is nothing but stupid numbers.

This isn't exactly news.
I have seen several posts about how banks are shitting their pants at the prospect of a currency they can't control, but the fact is Bitcoin is way too small for them to be interested in.
Notwithstanding the fact you might think the average Wall Street banker is a dumbass, there are a few of them that are pretty smart cookies. You can be sure enough of them know exactly what bitcoin is, and how it works to have made it possible for them to trade with it if they wanted to.
Fact is, they don't. Bitcoin at it's height represented less one MILLIONth of the volume of US$ currency trade. 
To use a fatuous example, in volume terms, Wall Street will be more interested in trading Vietnamese dong than it will be in Bitcoin.
The buzz around Bitcoin is the technology / implementation. As a financial instrument it is well below the radar.

As a sceptic, if I was someone who had never used bitcoins, and saw 'save 9% on your order', clicked it then saw 'You save 7%', I'd think someone was dicking me about.
So, the answer would be to say 'save up to 9%', and put the exact saving next to the options;
    "Send using a Coinbase account (9% discount)"
    "Send using a bitcoin address (9% discount)"
    "Don't have any bitcoin? (7% discount)"

So what are your actual predictions for Black Friday? You seem to be calling a significant event. Care to expand, or are you just going to pick some isolated event afterwards and come back with 'I told you so'?
In the interests of transparency, before I go on, I am a regular poster to but not necessarily a mindless troll.
Regarding the volume of transactions - what do you think is the significance of this? You have to look at other factors. It's correct to say the volume of transactions has risen, but in fact the total value of those transactions has been pretty static for the last 8 months.
That to me means the average value of individual transactions has fallen. More trades, same value = smaller trades.
Can you explain that? I can. 
For the first half of 2014, there were a lot of speculators playing the Bitcoin market. This level of activity gradually dropped as the value of bitcoin dropped, and settled down to where it has been for the 2nd half of the year.
What has happened is that bigger money has left. The speculators / gamblers have taken their profits or losses, and gone elsewhere. What is left are enthusiasts and amateurs, who haven't understood the thing is over.
The speculators might have come back in to goose the market once or twice, which explains the pumps we have seen, but basically Bitcoin peaked in November/December last year.
that's my theory, based on empirical evidence. If you;v got evidence for something else, not just your gut feeling, let's hear it. 
@_date: 2014-11-12 10:15:28

Maybe. It's a different argument, one that is rehashed 100 times a week on this subreddit, so not very interesting.
The probem is, you're relying on an arbitrary limit in coins to make you money. People will usually find a way round that.
To look at the Bitcoins themselves as valuable is the same as taking a dollar bill and valuing it in terms of the paper it is made from. To Joe public, 100 bitcoins at $1 each is the same as 1 bitcoin at $100. The only question he might ask is 'why does that thing cost $100?'.
That's what people have been asking from the beginning. Where does the value in these things come from? There's nothing underlying them, they're not made from rare metal, there's no reason for them to be worth a lot of money.
I'm right on the edge of trolling here, I should really take all this to @_date: 2014-08-05 14:28:01
You're not actually buying goods with bitcoins. Just about every vendor on earth who is accepting bitcoins is just accepting a dollar value converted at the prevailing rate of exchange.
They're not actually doing what you think they are doing. They're not expanding the market for bitcoins, they're just expanding their customer base, and their numbers are still 100% dollar based (or whatever currency they normally trade in). Few of these places are holding or spending bitcoins. They just sell them.

@_date: 2014-09-19 13:37:28
What I'm saying is completely true. I'm not talking about the market cap of bitcoin in any way.
The market cap of bitcoin is the value of one bitcoin, times the number of bitcoins in existence. That's simple arithmetic.
What I'm saying is the mechanism that bitcoin uses - the blockchain etc, exists and works regardless of what bitcoins are worth.
It's something you should understand. I have seen people excitedly reporting that the Bank of England said 'Bitcoin is a good idea', and from that deciding they mean 'Bitcoin is valuable'.
That is completley wrong. The Bank of England actually said the bitcoin mechanism is a good idea. They like the way that transactions are securely validated, and said that this approach is something that could be developed.
They made no comment on bitcoin values, and the fact is the mechanism does the same thing whether you;re trading bitcoins at $1, or $1million.

UK law of course covers this.
The test is whether you have a reasonable prospect of discovering the rightful owner of goods which you find.
If you found a rucksack with £10,000 in cash, you would not be entitled to keep it - it is more than likely that the owner would notice the loss, and try to recover his property. He would contact the police, or lost property at the station. 
If you found something that was clearly identifiable - for example the £5 was in a wallet with somebody's driving licence and address, you would be expected to either contact the person, or hand the wallet and contents into the police or lost property office.
Keeping either of those things could mean you were prosecuted.
If you had seen someone drop it, then you would still not be entitled to keep it, you would have to try to give it back (or walk past it, at least). The rightful owner is identifiable.
If after a reasonable time the owner has not come forward, it would be considered as abandoned, and in most circumstances (e.g. having handed it in to police) you would be entitled to keep it, and the original owner would lose any title.
If it was just lying on the ground, and there was nobody obviously looking for it, you could argue that there was no practical way to identify the owner, and that you were entitled to keep it.
In those circumstances, which seems to be what the OP is describing, he could have pocketed the money without fear of prosecution. 
The higher the value, the more work you'd have to do to prove you were entitled to keep it.

I'm not telling you what to think and say, but if you approach what was essentially a comment on a business strategy with words like 'weak'  'corrupt' and 'evil', you're not being objective.
The Saudi comparison is exactly applicable. They gain their wealth from oil (as the banks do money), and rather than try to destroy the competition (as you say the banks would by doing 'everything in their power to stop Bitcoin'), they are investing in it and working to have some control over it.
If the banks thought bitcoin was a serious threat to their business, they would, as the Saudis and tobacco companies have done, make sure they had a slice of it, not waste time trying to destroy it.
Bitcoin is just a good idea that someone had, that has gained some traction. It's not a reaction to 'dishonest electronic money'. That came afterwards.

There is a big difference between a country using something as its currency, and trading in a currency.
The UK has rejected the Euro as a replacement for the pound, but London has no problem whatsoever trading the Euro, and any other currency that needs trading.

To be absolutely correct, small speculators own the market.
The cash required to swing the market a hundred bucks a day has gone. 
Now it's 90% small holders of btc, who spend their days trumpeting news about how much Bitcoin is growing, urging other people to spend their Bitcoins, hoping that this will for some reason bring back the mass speculation that drove the market to $1,000+
There's no reason for that to work. MS might be indirectly supplying goods to Bitcoin buyers, but they don't give a crap what the Bitcoins are worth. The middlemen who do the exchange for them don't give a crap what it's worth, as they almost certainly dump the BTC as soon as they get it.
They think increased demand will lead to shortage of BTC, which will drive up the price. It won't. If people can't get bitcoin, they'll use their Visa cards.
Simple fact - the big money is out of BTC, there's nothing driving the price.

It doesn't function if no one validates transactions. Not the same.
So, what happens is people charge to do that. Then it all falls over because it's just the same as a visa card.
But you're putting the cart before the horse if you say it must be mined to work. You are requiring it to have enough value for mining to be worthwhile. There's never any guarantee of that.

Anything that has the ability to make money will do the same thing.
Why do you think stock markets are so heavily regulated? It's becuase without the regulation it would be just as wild as Bitcoin. If a price can change, people will try to make it do exactly that, not for any reason other than to make money.
Bitcoin as a payment mechanism might well be good for humanity, but the moment it was given a floating value, it just became another way to make money. Add to that it's almost entirely unregualted and you shouldn't be surprised it has been taken over by sharks.

There are enough mined already for it to be sustainable. At $10, there are what, about $150 million worth floating around?

If you're in dispute with them, the jurisdiction is Hong Kong. The terms have a couple of dispute resolution clauses.
First they have 30 days to respond to your claim, by way of the following clause; "You must contact us within 7 days of the transaction you wish to discuss. We will endeavor to correct the error or problem, or alternatively explain to you why we believe the transaction was correct within 30 days of the transaction."
Make sure you have mailed them at 'hello explaining the problem, and asking for their response.
If 30 days after you have done that, you have no received a proper explanation, you will have to notify them that a dispute has arisen, and that you wish to claim arbitration against them. 
You need to read up on Hong Kong law for this, but broadly speaking you are required to submit the dispute to arbitration in Hong Kong, because of the following term in the terms of service;
"Any dispute arising under this Agreement shall be finally settled on an individual basis and in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of Hong Kong. You hereby expressly waive any trial by jury. The Arbitration shall take place in Hong Kong in the English language and the arbitral decision may be enforced in any courts. The prevailing party in any action or proceeding shall be entitled to costs and attorney’s fees."
This term precludes any court action - most courts will decline jurisdiction where there is an arbitration clause. Again, you'll need to swat up on HK law.
You can go to a court if an arbitration award has not been settled.
Have to say, from my own experience, this will be a long and expensive process. 
Remember folks, it's OK to skip over the user agreement when you install a piece of software, but if you're sending someone money, you need to know what happens if it all goes pear shaped. Read the terms.

People calling Bitcoin trading websites 'exchanges'.
You could argue that they are exchanging things, but they bear no resemblance whatsoever to the exchanges that trade stocks, commodities etc.
You want to trade apple stock on NASDAQ? You've got the entire weight of the SEC and 100 other agencies making sure you get what you've paid for, and can sell it when you want.
Trading bitcoin? You have NO IDEA what or where your contract counterparty is. It could be a single guy with a server, in some small out of reach jurisdiction somewhere in the Balkans, who is regulated by nobody, checked by nobody.
And people will send him thousands of dollars, because his website has a spiffy ticker on it.

I think he's talking sense.
I've never had too much trouble with Bitcoin as a payment system. It certainly can get around a few problems that exist. 
It has been said many times, by people here and in the media, that Bitcoin has become two things - a payment system, and a chaotic pump and dump.
The pump and dump clearly is dying. No money is going in, and it becomes clearer every day that no significant amount of money ever needed to go in.
The 'natural' state for Bitcoin to function as a payment system will be influenced by activity level, but in reality it's probably not much more than about $10. 
It can't have a zero value, but it only needs to have a market cap equivalent to the volume of trade it covers.
So when the gamblers and neckbeards eventually get a clue, it might start working properly. At a sensible price, there's no point in stealing it, no point in mining it, so it could become stable, and therefore useful.
And as the article says, it's probably more likely to be a better implemented version that ends up being used.
@_date: 2015-01-14 11:40:43
You don't even seem to understand what shorting is.
What would 'dumping some bitcoin on the market' achieve, when you've just shoved the market down by selling bitcoin?
And honestly, a year of trying, and nobody has come up with the slightest evidence that any bank is even remotely interested in Bitcoin, let alone threatened by it. This is utter nonsense. The banks don't give a shit about this tiny market.
@_date: 2015-01-15 11:54:41
It's not a store of value. It's a token of value.
As a payment mechanism there's no argument at all for it to be worth anything more than a nominal amount.
$200 is a arbitrary value, as is $2,000, and $20.
Pick any one of them, Bitcoin as a payment mechanism is totally unaffected.

You'll never be able to answer it.
Bitcoin is in reality a very small market, populated by people who are not experienced traders - they are either speculators (aka gamblers), idealists or in some cases, crooks.
This makes it a very unusual niche. Don't expect it to behave like any market you've ever seen. 
Anyone making any prediction whatsoever about the price is talking out of their ass. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 13:08:19
So it's not always profitable.
This is rhetorical, we know it's not always profitable, you're just ignoring the space where the price has crashed, but difficulty has not adjusted.

No it won't.
First reason, the bitcoin itself has no inherent value. It is a payment mechanism. It can do that at pretty much any value. 
The moving value is based entirely on the sentiments of traders. There has never been a shortage of Bitcoin, ever, so it's obvious demand has not been a factor in the price, ever.
Second reason, economics 101 - scarcity only ever effects price if there is no alternative.
If someone wants Bitcoin to buy something, and can't get them, he'll break out his Visa card or a $100 bill, not offer more for the Bitcoin.
really, it's pretty clear to anyone who is not sitting, Gollum like, on their bitcoins waiting to get rich, that the value of them is arbitrarily decided between a bunch of gamblers and amateurs. You might make a few bucks, but that's just plain old dumb luck.

The only issue with a $1 value is that it would have an effect on liquidity.
If Bitcoin daily trade is $50 million, you don't have enough coins available at $1. It would get squeezed. Likely result is that people would stop using it, move to easier alternatives.
$10 would probably be more than enough as a value though. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 12:54:32
The price you see is actually the last trade made on whatever exchange you're looking at. Its a transaction between a buyer and a seller.
What happens is the buyers line up, with the one willing to pay the highest price at the front of the queue.
The sellers then line up in front of them, with the one willing to sell at the lowest price at the front.
When the buyers price and the sellers price match, they do the deal, and the price is shown.
Then the next highest buyer, and the next lowest seller are at the front of the queue. (either of them could actually be the same person as before, with more to sell at the same price).
If there is a difference between the buy and sell price, we wait. Either someone with a better price will jump in front of them, or they will change their price, and off we go again.
That's how pretty much all markets work. Queues of buyers and sellers, making bids and offers, and trading when the two prices meet each other.
The mining has nothing to do with this. It only effects price by being a source of coins for sale. The miners are probably keen to sell, so they are 'jumping' the queue by offering coins cheaply. If you take some of them out of the picture, then the price might firm up, because there are less coins being offered.

You miss the point, and come out with what seems to be an ass backwards conclusion.
The two main things you have decided blockchain is used for are achievable in dozens of ways. These are things that have been done for decades, if not centuries. These are not new functions that only a blockchain can perform.
The interest in blockchain is because of the way it requires authentication. It is possibly unique in it's resistance to attack.
The idea that a blockchain needs to provide some tangible reward to the authenticators to function is absolutely wrong. If I'm a big bank, and I want to implement my own blockchain to authenticate transactions, the fact that what I create is authenticating transactions IS the reward. I have solved a problem, I don't need a 'byproduct' like Bitcoin for it to function.
Bitcoin is not blockchain, any more than an apple is a tree. 'A' blockchain is not 'The' blockchain either - the blockchain that tracks Bitcoin is simply the most visible version of many dozens of blockchains that have sprung up around cryptocurrencies.
People looking at blockchain tech to underpin their own businesses don't give a shit about Bitcoin, it's value or how many people use it.

Yes, but if a Satoshi is a fraction of a Bitcoin, then the price of the two are inextricably linked. 
You're either going to need a lot of Satoshis, or you need a few Satoshis to be worth more. If the Satoshis are worth more, then so are the Bitcoins.
Either way, no supply conditions are going to significantly affect the price. They're tokens, not a valuable commodity.

OK, well maybe this is a different argument.
People say 'scarcity' will drive up the price of Bitcoin, the same way as a bad crop drives up the price of wheat, but it's not going to work like that.
Wheat prices go up because people must have wheat, and cannot easily replace it with something else. Not so with Bitcoin, most people can just break out a Visa card, use Paypal or just pay in cash. The few people who cannot use any of those methods are unlikely to be the drivers of some massive price increase.

Anyone who does understand markets knows what the actual correct answer is, which makes it a waste of time to argue about it.

This doesn't work, it never has. There are thousands of brokers who get drunk at lunch and decide to goose a market. It's almost a tradition.
You're counting on a market panicking at a small sale, but not immediately recovering when you try to buy 25 x as much as you sold? That's just idiotic.

I wouldn't keep doing this publicly.
The terms of service are not very clear, they have an arbitration clause, but also require disputes to be submitted to the Canadian courts, but trying to do this in public will probably not help at all. 
Take the default position, and assume they have a good reason to do what they're doing - if they do and you keep throwing hissy fits, they will indeed ignore you, why would they do anything else?
If it was me, I'd take an hour or two to properly read the terms of service. You have to comply with them, and with Canadian law. Bitching on Reddit every week isn't either of those things.

Everything that makes the price go down when he sells $2m, will also make it go back up when he buys $2m. Then you're back where you started for the $50 million he's planning to spend.

You need to be looking at your contract with them, to make sure you're doing the right thing, at the right time. I can guarantee weekly pissy updates on Reddit are not the right thing.

Just something to consider as part of this discussion - I'm not telling anyone what they should and shouldn't do here, but if you're talking about a lot of money you might have a look at estate law where you are.
If you have a substantial value of Bitcoins, they are in theory part of your estate. Giving access to them to a specific person without any thoughts as to whether they have rights to them could leave a mess behind.
So if for example you give details of how to access your stash to person A, when person B is the rightful heir to your estate, person A cannot dispose of those coins, and if he does, person B may well have grounds to sue that person.
This might just look like a 'pfft, whatever' post, but many expensive and damaging lawsuits and even criminal cases have arisen because of similar circumstances. Just be careful that you've protected whoever you want your assets to actually go to.
TL;DR - giving someone physical access to your assets doesn't necessarily give them legal rights to it.
@_date: 2016-06-27 11:48:41
Yes, that's exactly it.
You're right, it's a brilliant strategy, a new paradigm in trading. If I had the money to trade $50 million in Bitcoin, I'd be all over that.

If we're really being pedantic, these are not 'exchanges' in the same sense that stock and commodity exchanges are. 
These are websites. You are entirely at the mercy of a) the terms and conditions that the websites impose (which you have carefully read, naturally) when you open an account, and b) the laws of the jurisdiction under which the website operates. This could be anywhere. Are you willing to go to a court in Bulgaria to get your money back?
A real exchange is heavily regulated, and stands guarantor for both your possessions, and the people you trade with. There is no such thing as a haircut on a real exchange.

No it isn't. Empirical means based on actual data. There is none, this is a market. 
You're stating that one event is impossible to predict, but another is certain, when the data for both is exactly the same. 
You're full of shit. That's based on empirical data - everything you've posted in this thread. 
@_date: 2015-04-23 09:12:19


That is exactly what I am saying. 
Your redefinition isn't how it works. 
Empirical evidence also tells you it doesn't work like that. The day after your position is showing a loss, normal exchanges ask you to pay the money. Bitcoin exchanges shut your position down.
If you haven't made a loss, why do they do that? 
@_date: 2015-04-17 13:28:10
That's not the point though.
Whether they automatically liquidate a position or not, that's not what a margin call is.
A margin call is a perfectly normal occurrence, and has no implications at all for a traders position provided he deals with it. 
In the meantime, a proper exchange would require that you put up initial margins anyway, which avoid the need for margin calls immediately following a trade. It's only when your account (including any credit limits) reaches that limit that you get a margin call.
If you pay it, nothing else happens.
@_date: 2015-04-22 14:40:24
If that's the case, what you say makes sense. If you've borrowed the money for what is effectively your initial margin, and walk away when you lose that, the lender is the one getting hosed.
It's starting to get a little remote from the margin call discussion though. These are effectively two different transactions - a loan, and a trading account.
@_date: 2015-04-23 06:03:34
[edit] I see I messed up the maths, where I said 10,000, should be 1,000. Oops. 
OK, inthink again there is a slight confusion on terms, but there's no such thing as a dense question in this thread. 
When you say you have a contract to sell them next week, in fact you have already sold them, and have a contract to *deliver* them next week. 
So, you are now short 100 bitcoin. 
The exchange looks at it like this;
Sold 100 @ 222    = $22,200 credit (the proceeds of the sale, to be received next week)
Will have to buy 100 @ $232 = 23,200 debit (what it will cost to buy bitcon right now to deliver next week).
So, you are plus 22,200 and minus 23,200, net balance is minus 10,000. [correction, $1,000]
As a trader, I might think "ok, well I think the price will go to 212 before next week, so I'll let that ride for now."
The exchange however don't calculate based on anything but the current price, so they will ask you for $10k to bring your account to zero. They send you a margin call for $10k. [correction - $1k]
If you pay it, your account is as above, but now has a cash balance of +10k, so the net balance is zero. 
If the price next week does go to 212, your balance would be;
+ 22,200 (proceeds of sale)
- 21,200 (cost of bitcoins)
+ 10,000 (cash paid) [see edit at top . . ]
Balance is now +20k, your profit is 10k (as you had to put 10k in earlier). [2k, 1k, 2k]
Now if the xchange don't include that step where they ask you for the $10k, and just liquidate, the sums are as follows;
+ 22,200 proceeds of sale. 
- 23,200 price debited to 'buy' coins to cover your short position. 
Balance is minus 10k, and it doesn't matter what the market does now, you have no position. 
Ref executed - in contract terms, executed just means 'done', so I think you mean liqidated. The answer is - it depends on the terms  of your agreement with the exchange. 
On a traditional exchange, they would generally be required to send you a margin call, which if paid would mean they left you position as it was. 
On these Bitcoin exchanges, it seems they do not do that, they immediatel liquidate without issuing a mrgin call. That to me is a risk, i would not trade anything on those terms.

If you're lucky, and the person you're talking to also calls a liquidation a margin call, then you will have no problems (until a real margin call comes along, when neither of you would know what it was).
If the other person knows what a margin call really is, what you were saying would make no sense to them.

@_date: 2015-04-22 13:31:51
Well, in theory that's what a margin call is for - it's the buffer between you losing money on a position, and the exchange pulling the plug.
That's exactly how my accounts work, and I pay my margins. If the broker/exchange didn't think I was going to, they wouldn't let me trade.
The Bitcoin trading sites take a different view, it seems. They are working on the assumption that nobody would pay margin calls, so they don;t bother, they just pull the plug.
That's not really trading to me. It's gambling. You lose, you're out. 
@_date: 2015-04-22 18:15:46

I'm fine with the idea that some organizations don't send margin calls. I wouldn't want to trade like that, but there's nothing that says it has to happen.

Hmm. I'm dubious - not about Bitcoin, but about the whole idea.
I lived in Brazil for 10 years, and knew a few other expats while I was there.  I can say that although you'd think people will pay well for a can of heinz beans, they won't pay *that* much more for them.
The shipping is what kills it, of course. The only 'model' that works (other than the britishcornershop one) is the way the foreign shops work over here - a wholesaler orders a whole or part container load of goods (like, several tons of stuff), and sells it to all the shops when it arrives. Obviously this takes at least several weeks to do, probably more like 2 months.
You can see how it works - there are 4 or 5 Brazilian shops in London, and when one of them gets some new stock, the others usually get it too.
Shipping a 5kg box of stuff ad hoc costs a fortune, the £39.99 cost you mentioned isn't all profit for the seller, it's reflecting the fact his buyer wants the goods now, not in 8 weeks time. It would be sent by air.
So I think the Bitcoin aspect is irrelevant, if it's not based on a workable business it doesn't matter how you're getting paid.
@_date: 2015-04-22 16:40:19
You're saying you don't get called, but if you do get called, you get liquidated.
My point is simple. A margin call is a demand for funds. If you get margin called, you do not get liquidated unless you fail to pay the margin call.
It may be that there is no such thing as a margin call in the Bitcoin world, in which case, don't call it a margin call. Call it by the correct name - a liquidation.
@_date: 2015-04-23 08:02:54
It is a definite loss, not a possible loss. I don't know what you're looking at on Google, but the fact the contract is for delivery in the future doesn't change that at all.
The exchange will only value your position as of now. It's called 'marking to market' and whatever number pops up from doing that is your actual financial position. If it's a negative, that is an actual loss which you are responsible for, right now. You would be expected to pay for the loss right now too, not when the contract expires, or you close the position yourself.
That's how (most) futures / trading accounts would work. I say most because it seems Bitcoin accounts rarely work the same as normal trading accounts.
tl;dr, the exchange don't care how long the futures contract has to run, losses against the current market have to be settled immediately.
[edit] I messed up the numbers in the example, $10k should read $1k all through. 
@_date: 2015-04-22 14:22:50
Yeah, but it's still wrong.
You can brush it off by saying 'that's how it works in Bitcoinland', but that's 100% a result of someone getting it wrong to start with.
If you understand what it means, then all is fine. Your problem is when you are talking to someone who understands it as something different, and someone gets fucked as a result. You'd find that being the person who was using the wrong terminology, you'd lose any argument about it.
Probably not an issue if you're bickering about a $25 loss, but take that into the real world and you'd end up in a mess.
@_date: 2015-04-17 12:58:28
It's a demand by an exchange for funds to bring an account back in to it's agreed limit.
If you fail to pay, the exchange may liquidate the position.
'safe margin'? That's a rather subjective term. 
Holy shit, I hope none of you people are actually trading these markets.
@_date: 2015-04-22 13:35:43
I've said the same thing before.
It's semantics though. To me an exchange is a lot more sophisticated than anything I have seen in Bitcoin trading.
They act as principal between buyers and sellers - your contract is with them, and they stand as guarantor. To do that, they are heavily regulated and have very strict financial requirements to satisfy. 
But nobody can stop you calling a Bitcoin trading site an exchange if you want to. I wouldn't.
@_date: 2015-04-22 13:25:01
I think you're spot on.
The brokers I use for futures trading are comfortable that I will cover losses I make - they have checked very carefully, and will periodically update these checks (eg, I have to submit accounts to them regularly).
The Bitcoin trading sites don't / can't do any of this, but then you can't really call them 'exchanges'.
@_date: 2015-04-22 13:41:46
You're very welcome, and I'm happy to do it.
@_date: 2015-04-22 15:58:10
Yes, I know what you're saying, but this is still wooly.
A movement in a market does not bring a margin call into effect. There is no such thing as a margin call 'being in effect'.
If an account is in debit beyond it's limits, the broker will issue a margin call - that is the limit of what a margin call is, it is only the demand for funds.
The ones I get are all computer generated, but the human manager of my account will have a simple printout that he can scan and immediately see whether I have paid my margin calls or not. 
If I haven't (and it happens), he'll be straight on the phone. 
@_date: 2015-04-13 12:21:15
I can't see that posting FUD on an internet forum is a particularly coherent strategy for short sellers. Shorting is rarely a long term position, and poking Bitcoiners with sticks is unlikely to provoke a sudden crash.
I'm sure some of these things do happen, but the extent to which people here think they happen is astonishing. 
The logical answer is that it's just people being people. People posting here are far more willing to accept negative comment is bullshit than they are positive comment. It can;t be true all of the time, and I suspect it isn't true most of the time.
I'm speaking for my self here - I think Bitcoin is nonsense, and have said it many times. I avoid being cruel, and usually try to at least be constructive, but I'm being paid by nobody, and have never had any position in Bitcoin whatsoever.
@_date: 2015-04-22 13:56:22
I've tried that, it doesn't work.
And a margin call is not to cover possible losses, it's to cover actual losses.
The margin to cover possible losses is an initial margin.
Maybe it's not as straightforward as you think it is.
@_date: 2015-04-17 14:11:36
The margin call would be when the position is making a loss, and OkCoin send a demand for you to deposit funds to bring the account back into credit.
It's a 'call', they are calling on you to provide funds.
If they either decided to liquidate the position themselves, or did it because you had not paid your margin call, it's called a liquidation, or selling against you, or whatever other terminology they want to use, but that is not a 'margin call'.
I get margin calls all the time, I pay them and my positions are unaffected.
The issue here - if someone said to me 'you're going to get margin called' on one of my positions, I'd simply make sure I had funds ready to pay it. If it turns out they'd just shut down my position, I'd be pretty pissed off.
They're not the same thing. One is a relatively benign administrative procedure that just about every trader on earth deals with on a daily basis, the other is a potentially catastrophic closure of a position without reference to the trader.
@_date: 2015-04-16 05:48:47
Those things don't matter at all to 99.9% of people who want to make a payment. 
They don't need something that stores value, it's not the only way to transfer value and I don't even know what 'network effect' means. Does it make Bitcoin the only way to make a payment? If not, it's irrelevant. 
Bitcoin may have unique characterisics, but they're not going to cause most people to choose a scarce resource over an easily available one. 
Green apples are different to red apples, but if there aren't any green ones in the store, people will not go searching for them, or pay a lot more for them, they'll buy the red ones.

They hate being told they're wrong about anything. It'd just be downvoted to oblivion in about 4 seconds.
@_date: 2015-04-22 16:16:33
But the effect is not called 'margin call'.
It is, bearing in mind I'm not a programmer 'an account that it outside of it's preset limits'.
When an account is in that state, the computer will generate a demand for funds. That demand is a 'margin call'.
The state that you are talking about is now 'an account that is outside of it's preset limits, and the demand for funds has not yet been met'.
This is simply a semantic argument, one that 99.9% of the world does not see the way you see it.
A margin call is nothing more than a demand for funds.
@_date: 2015-04-09 12:22:23
Maybe. So long as you don;t risk a lot of money, what's the harm in trying?
Regarding the website - you have to remember they're running a business there, so you have to expect a markup. It's a fact that delivery costs for this kind of thing are always going to be way out of proportion, so personally I'd stop short at calling it exploitative. All businesses work like this to some extent, that's the point of running one.
Just to amuse you, I work amongst other things with mid sized bulk carrier ships. Our cost to carry 1kg of goods from one side of the world to the other is around 4p/kilo.
@_date: 2015-04-20 16:13:12
If that's the case, there is no margin call.
You'd have to look at the terms governing your account to know how they would react to losses on the account.
Which I suspect is a whole new can of worms. Is there even an enforceable contract created when you set up an account? What is the jurisdiction? The big question is, what happens when it all goes to shit?
My guess is there's a vague agreement, they are entitled to do whatever they want without reference to the trader. The reason they don't make margin calls is that they know if a trader is working on a highly leveraged margin account and loses money, he'll just disappear into thin air when they try to collect.
These are nothing like regulated futures accounts.

I won't lose any sleep over it. This is just more of the usual cack-handed Bitcoin bullshit.

That all makes sense.
Our margins are usually calculated on the settlement price at the end of the trading session. As you say, the exchange isn't going to be able to call for and receive funds 'realtime'. It would be impractical.
Also bear in mind, some volatile exchanges have mechanisms to control really wild price swings, these are called limits, and are tripped by big movements in prices. They will suspend trading for a set amount of time, to allow people to get their breath back. Not all have them, but it's not unusual.
Google limit up/limit down if you're interested.

Simple answer is, I don't know. You would need to read the terms of service.

OK, if you can improve on what the others are doing, maybe it'll work better.
But bear in mind that even if you can do that, you're still selling £2 jars of Branston pickle for a tenner each. I know from my own experience that even if we understand why it costs so much, a 500% markup still looks like a really shitty deal.
Just saying. I don't want to piss all over your idea, but I can tell you that I knew about the websites that could send stuff out for the whole time I was abroad, and never once ordered anything from them.
Just to be a total raincloud, you're also probably making it less appealing by doing it in Bitcoin. 90% of your expat market will be perfectly capable of paying with a UK credit card / bank account / paypal, so asking them to go through the hoops to get Bitcoin isn't going to be an advantage. 
@_date: 2015-04-22 12:44:58
No, a margin call doesn't 'arrive', it is something the exchange/broker calculate, and send to you.
Price moves against you, exchange/broker check your account (in reality it's all computerised of course).
If you are beyond the agreed limit (which could be zero if you have no credit account), they send you a request for funds. *That* is the margin call.
You don't pay it because ~yolo etc, they are entitled to liquidate.
That's how it normally works, but in Bitcoinland it seems not. Doesn't change the fact that liquidating a position is not a 'margin call'.
@_date: 2015-04-22 13:28:41
Yes, the money you put up to be allowed to trade would the same thing as an initial margin.
I think the rest of what you say is absolutely correct.
@_date: 2015-04-22 14:01:29
If you're determined enough to do this, it's probably not difficult, but one of the requirements I have on all my accounts is that I disclose which other accounts and credit limits I have elsewhere. 
As far as Bitcoin being simpler, I think you're right, and if you are just trading for your own account, putting as much money as you can afford to lose into it is a perfectly sensible strategy.
I trade futures against physical goods, and we use extensive credit facilities. It's a different kind of business entirely.
@_date: 2015-04-22 15:41:19
Well, I stand to be corrected, but there are markets where you can trade without having to 'borrow' to cover your shorts.
Commodity markets on a very fundamental level exist for people to sell goods now for delivery in the future. That could be a farmer who has just planted a crop, and has sold it for delivery when it is harvested. He can't borrow those goods, as they simply don't exist anywhere.
But I know where you're coming from. You used to be able to short stocks at will, but as I understand it they tightened up the rules to stop mad speculation from trashing markets.
Whether that could be effectively enforced in Bitcoin markets is debatable. 
@_date: 2015-04-23 09:23:08
You're not selling at a future date, you're selling now. It's *that* simple. 
@_date: 2015-04-22 08:27:35
Ho hum well here we go again.
He didn't get 'margin called' he got liquidated.
If he had been margin called, he would have received a demand from the exchange for funds to bring his account back into it's limits. Had he paid that margin call, his position would have been unaffected.
From what is being described here, his position was simply liquidated.
Normal futures accounts on normal regulated exchanges don;t work that way. Nobody in their right minds would trade on an account where the exchange can liquidate your position without any warning - for exactly this reason. 
Margin calls are a way for the trader to run his position strategically - he may be OK with a loss position if he either believes it will recover, or is hedged in another contract.
Just having your position zapped like this is amateur stuff. These aren't futures, they're not traded on an exchange, and that wasn't a margin call.
It's just gambling.
@_date: 2015-04-17 15:16:48
Well, I think being 'technically right' might just be an important fact, seeing as we're talking about people risking potentially large sums of money.
If you're not crystal clear about what these terms mean, you could have a really bad day. 
If people are confused about what 'margin call' means, (and they are), what else don't they know? These things all have very direct consequences.
I wasn't allowed to trade without supervision for the first 2 years I was working, for exactly this reason. 
@_date: 2015-04-23 08:54:26
I am the OP.
On a normal futures market, such as Chicago board of trade, MATIF, etc, the losses you make must be settled as they are incurred. 
If the market moves against you, you will receive a margin call the next day. If you don't pay that, the exchange may close your position.
There is no wiggle room here. It's not a question of logic, it's fact.
Again, you don't have a contract to *sell* X units in 2020, you have already sold them, and you have a contract to *deliver* them in 2020. You have lost the money *now*. Your account is negative.
Just for info . . . most futures contracts only run to about 12 - 18 months in the future, with the nearer positions being most active.
@_date: 2015-04-13 15:09:56
It adds up to the same thing.
The question for me is; are we doing it for our own amusement, or are we doing it for some kind of personal gain - whether that's payment or to increase the value of something we own doesn't matter.
I think the majority of it is just for amusement.
I think there are far more bitcoiners trying to pump the price for personal gain than there are buttcoiners trying to bring it down for personal gain. 
@_date: 2015-04-23 09:07:36
It hasn't changed anywhere else, but if you want to use an incorrect term, that's up to you. 
All I'm doing is telling you it's wrong.
@_date: 2015-04-17 12:39:26
Does anyone in this thread actually know what 'margin call' means?
@_date: 2015-04-22 15:07:43
This is the problem - the terminology has become mangled.
You haven't been margin called without a call, you have probably been liquidated (or whatever term you want to use) without being margin called.
A margin call is a call for margin. Call being a request, margin being funds. 
That's the point of this thread, to try and explain how it works on traditional futures accounts, and therefore should work on Bitcoin trading accounts.
@_date: 2015-04-22 12:54:39
Well, it's not simple to explain because they're not really simple things.
Hedging - when you take two opposing positions, so that if one loses, the other gains.
Example - if I buy some physical goods (eg wheat), I have a risk that if the market for wheat goes down, I will lose money because I will sell for less than I bought for.
So I hedge it by selling wheat futures. If the market goes down, I lose on the physical wheat, but gain on the futures. That is called short selling, more below on that.
- Futures. Buying or selling something that will only become an actual trade in the future. Simple example, if I am a fuel refinery, I might decide I need 100,000 barrels of oil next November, so I can go to the oil futures market and buy 100,000 barrels of 'November' futures. In November, whoever sold those futures to me has to deliver 100,000 barrels of oil to me.
This is a very simplified version, in reality most of the volume of any futures market is people who have no intention of taking delivery (or delivering) whatever it is they're trading, they are either hedging or speculating, and will buy/sell back to the market before the position expires.
- Shorting. Effectively selling something you don't already own.
Why do that? I'd maybe do it if I expected the market to fall.
If I sell something today for $200, and tomorrow the market drops to $150, I can buy it back for that price, and I make $50. Sold for 200, bought for 150.
Again, shorting is often used as a hedge, so it's not necessarily someone speculating.
@_date: 2015-04-22 15:20:16
You are still not using the term 'margin call' appropriately.
When you say 'then a margin call was in effect', with all respect, that makes no sense.
A margin call does not 'come into effect', it is a demand by a broker/exchange for funds. 
I have also seen a few times, people saying 'you are technically correct', then go on to say why I'm wrong.
Well, I am technically correct, so trying to re-interpret what I'm saying will only ever lead you to the wrong conclusion.
Simple fact is, if you're not looking at a request from your broker/exchange for funds to bring your account into it's limits, you are not looking at a margin call. 
@_date: 2015-04-17 13:36:01
Yes, I am. More than 25 years trading futures.
They might well get margin called when the market goes beserk, but 'being margin called' is not having your position liquidated, it is being required to make a payment.
So, the thread title is absolute nonsense.
The reason I'm saying all this is because I see the same thing said regularly in these bitcoin subs, and it seems to me half the people supposedly trading these markets have no clue what the terminology they're using actually means.
That's kind of worrying.

It is probably more to do with the amount, I'm guessing. Lenders are very wary of people borrowing their deposit, and creating a charge on the property. 
I had a similar problem a while back, when the buyer of my old place pulled out at the last minute, and my mother lent me the deposit forthe new place. The mortgage co then pulled out, as in theory my mother could have had some title rights to the property. 
@_date: 2015-04-15 09:55:34
You're missing one very important *basic* economic fact here.
Scarcity, and an increase in price as a response, only exists where there is no alternative.
Bitcoin is not the only means of making a payment, and as long as there are alternatives, people will turn to them if there is any shortage of Bitcoin.
That's not an opinion, that's a fact borne out by hundred of years of empirical evidence. It's economics 101.

I think there is a tendency to overestimate the significance of a state declaring itself to be pro Bitcoin.
London did the same thing last year.
What they're doing is hedging. They have no particular faith in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, they are just throwing a hat into the ring, so that if cryptocurrencies DO take off, they will be seen as a place to do that business.
It costs them nothing to do this, so why not?
@_date: 2015-04-09 11:43:40
Well, on the plus side, the website you're talking about seems to survive (and has been around a long time), so if you have a better way, it must be worth at least trying it.
My concern is only that the market might be much smaller than you'd imagine. There are certainly a lot of expats around who would love to have a reliable supplier of treats from home, but they are treats, and that means high cost very rapidly kills demand.
In economic terms, the demand is very elastic. That's what makes it hard. 
On a small scale, maybe it would work better. Give it a go, but don't make it only about Bitcoin, that's just a hurdle.
@_date: 2015-04-22 13:13:12
Yes, that's pretty much it.
The exchange/broker are certainly running a risk. If I don't pay my margin call, the loss is potentially on their books.
At the risk of confusing things, they minimise this risk by collecting something called an 'initial margin'. It is a payment you make up front to cover immediate market movements after you trade. 
They also have much stricter requirements than Bitcoin trading sites. To get my futures accounts open, I had to present audited accounts, details of banking facilities, do a lot of work to prove I was good for any money I might lose.
My brokers are pretty confident I'm good for the money. As you say, Bitcoin trading sites do none of this, so their only protection probably is the right to zap you the moment you are losing money.

@_date: 2015-04-22 18:08:23
The loss is real, the margin call is a demand for you to provide the funds l to cover that loss. It is not collateral at all, you're not gettiing anything back unless you make money on the market afterwards. 
If a trader does not pay the margin call, then a position may be liquidated to stop any further losses, and as part of the process of closing that traders account. 
The time difference between the two is irrelevant to my original point, i'm only trying to point out that they are two differnt things - if you already understand that, then I'm happy. 
@_date: 2015-04-14 10:38:52
There still seems to be reluctance to separate the price from the mechanics of Bitcoin.
I'll be accused of FUD here, but the price is largely irrelevant to people who are actually using Bitcoin and it's mechanism for payments.
Lots of work has been done to bring new users into the system, but why does that have to have any effect on price? The baseline is still the US$ value, so as a user that's all I care about.
Simple arithmetic is as follows.
I want a gadget that costs $100. I want to pay in Bitcoin, and the seller agrees to accept Bitcoin.
The seller really just wants me to give him $100 worth of Bitcoin. Whether that's 0.1 bitcoins, 1 bitcoin or 200 bitcoins doesn't make any difference to him, so long as he can sell it for $100.
Nor to me. I just have to buy $100 of Bitcoin and send it to the seller.
Fact is that the mechanical side of Bitcoin works the same regardless of price. Nobody there cares.
What you are left with is a fairly simple market, trading in something that has no intrinsic value. That'll move on sentiment - which might well include perception of Bitcoins penetration of the physical market, but that is clearly not having a significant positive effect. There are numerous daily reports of new places to spend Bitcoin, but the price is still declining.
What does that mean? The users have no interest in price. The holders of Bitcoin do, but have no means to affect the price.

@_date: 2015-04-22 16:05:11
I think it's pretty rare.
On most established and regulated markets, it's very difficult to get a futures trading account without either putting up the cash, or being able to prove you are good for credit.
The traders who are able to do that aren't the kind of people who will a) run off if they rack up losses, or b) get themselves into that position in the first place.
Having an account liquidated is quite a big deal - it shows that something somewhere has gone really badly wrong.
I've only been aware of it happening to people a handful of times in more than 25 years, and it's almost always part of a more spectacular meltdown of a trading company.
This is why I find Bitcoin to be so risky. You guys are watching things happen that would tear any other market apart, and half the time I don't think some people realise what a clusterfuck it is.
@_date: 2015-04-22 12:59:19
The real issue would be if you are a trader, and have a position that is losing money, and expect the exchange to give you the chance to fix that problem before they pull the plug on you.
To me, 'you're getting a margin call' means I have to pay some money, not that my position is getting liquidated. The risk is that my position is liquidated, I don;t know about it, then the market reverses.
I think I'm actually making money, but as the exchange have closed my position, I'm not.
@_date: 2015-04-17 14:31:46


This is the point. A margin call creates the buffer between a loss making account, and liquidation of the position. It is a chance for you to resolve the problem without having your position closed by the exchange.
These guys think a margin call is the liquidation. 
@_date: 2015-04-17 15:44:33

@_date: 2015-04-22 14:07:39
It's not a stupid question, it's actually a very good question.
To me it is pretty unclear who 'the guy who lent the money' actually is.
When the guy shorted the Bitcoin, he sold them. If this was through an exchange, there would be someone on the other side that he sold them to.
When he walks, he is effectively cancelling that sale, the coins he 'sold' will never be delivered, so the buyer now doesn't get the coins he bought, and the market has gone up so he must pay more to cover that loss.
In Bitcoin trading, is it the 'exchange' who bought the coins? If so, then they have lost.
If they have matched the trade with someone who is buying, do they then tell that buyer 'sorry, these coins don't actually exist, sorry for your loss'?
Or do they eat the loss themselves?
On a normal exchange, the exchange eat the loss. That's why they are careful about who is trading.
Who knows with Bitcoin?

It's not specifically bypassing checks, it could be a legal issue for the lender. 
If somebody else lends you the funds, you could be creating a charge over the property, and it might have an effect on the lenders rights over the property - which is pledged as collateral.

This explanation of what they're doing sort of highlights another of the issues that Bitcoin land is confused about.
It explains that there is a difference between OTC trading, and exchange trading. OTC you are contracting directly with a counterparty, whereas on an exchange your principal is the exchange themselves, and they are effectively taking on the counterparty risk.
I have long argued that most (if not all) of the sites where you can trade bitcoin are not exchanges at all, for exactly that reason. They are simply matching buyers and sellers in OTC trades. The risk of your counterparty walking is entirely yours.
That's how it is in traditional futures trading, it seems it would be helpful if Bitcoin traders understood this.

How could it be classed as income?
I know nothing about the German system, but wouldn't gains on Bitcoin be classed as capital gains? If you did not realise any gains (which as they were stolen you couldn't have), where is your tax liability?
Surely it is the tax peoples responsibility to prove you had undeclared income, and if you didn;t, they won;t be able to.
That would leave the 60k to deal with, and any shit you've caused by claiming benefits when you were not entitled to.

The problem here is you've got an asymetric emotional investment in the two forums.
Buttcoiners are generally there to mock and enjoy the failures in the Bitcoin world - I know you think they are all shills for big banks, but it isn't true. It's just the internet being the internet.
Thus they really don't care that you post threads criticising them. They actually enjoy it, as it shows they've got under your skin.
The opposite isn't true. A lot of Bitcoiners are unhealthily obsessed with the fortunes of bitcoin, but have little expertise or knowledge of how markets actually work. It's very easy to provoke them, simply by making them face these shortcomings. There are many other ways to piss them off, of course.
So, there is an imbalance. Just count how many 'troll' threads are deleted from and compare to how many are deleted from The best way to deal with this is to ignore them. This is the second thread I've seen in the last two days calling out buttcoin posters. I can assure you they are enjoying it immensely, and are quite keen for you to post more of them.

Maybe when the price is stable, but if it shoots off in either direction, a lot of margin traders will lose their asses at exactly the same time (others will gain), and the whole thing could drop into the shitter, taking your money with it. 
There's a reason these sites don't actually make real margin calls, and close out positions immediately. The traders generally aren't good for their losses.

Don't confuse it with an IPO on a regulated exchange. 
When you look at one of those, what you are told is to a large extend conservative and carefully worked. If the company misrepresents, exaggerates or fails to make data available to all potential investors, they can be sued. 
Crowdfunding is unregulated, with no comebacks (absent straight fraud). Those guys were posting clarifications and answering queries on Reddit, something you'd never see in an IPO. 
They can tell you whatever they think you want to hear, and if it turns out to be innacurate, it's your problem.

Or, don't. As far as economic analysis on this sub goes, yours isn't the worst I have ever seen. It's wrong, but not the worst. Nobody will lose money if they take it seriously.

This is how it already works. The only difference is that at the moment people use this wierd shit called money.

That isn't what fungible means.

If it's capital gains, it's exactly that.
All I can see is the 60k he made actually selling them. In most tax regimes there won't be tax due if the asset hasn't been sold, and if his coins were stolen, he didn't sell them.
Not saying the 60k isn't a problem, but I don't see how the rest would be.

Not as far as the taxman is concerned.
It's a payment that has to be converted to US$, and is subject to exchange rate fluctuations. It's the same as any other currency.
Unless you think the IRS is going to start spending in Bitcoin, of course. I'm pretty sure that's not going to happen any time soon either.

Isn't it ironic that most of the 'successful' investors are the ones that now don't own any Bitcoins.

Yeah, you can do that, but it doesn’t mean you’re right. 
Fact is, there aren’t any bagholders left now. It’s over. Hope you sold at a good price.

I've transferred much bigger amounts than that out of Brazil, and not paid any tax.
Is this something you should have paid 25% on already, and haven't done? If you're just going for straightforward tax evasion, do what everybody else does and use a dolero.

None of it is based on scarcity. 
Scarcity only effects price when a) there is a shortage of whatever it is you need, and b) there is no alternative. 
Bitcoin doesn't seem to have any liquidity issues, and if there ever was, people would just use another payment method. It would be pretty rare that Bitcoin was the only choice, so the few times it was wouldn't have a significant effect on the market/price.

Fuck me, you're right.
Is my butler actually going to turn up for work if he's worth $750 million?
This is bad. really bad.

It’s not an asset. 
I’m not interested. You dragged me into this by calling me a troll, but you seem to think I’m here to be persuaded. 
Never going to happen. I have never owned any bitcoin or other cryptocurrency.

You think forcing people to talk about it is generally positive?
I don't. 
This idea is no different to trying to pay your taxes in Vietnamese dong. It will fail for the same reason as every other Bitcoin pump has failed - first thing people ask is whether they actually need this, and the answer is always no.
Sorry, you'll have to keep looking for other ways to get your bitcoins up to 40 grand.

There's no data either way.

Are you offering Bitcoin bonds then?
