That's a scary mentality. Put down your ego and instead shift that energy to pull the newbs up by educating them. Every expert was once an amateur! You too were once an amateur who may have at one point reached out to someone for help, imagine you were greeted with the same "survival of the fittest" line...would that feel good to hear? most likely not. By spreading education, we are securing the "network"
Unless of course, you are on the side of scamming people, in which case there is no future of us ever co-existing.

If your planning long term, you have nothing to worry about. Also, not sure if blaming BItcoin is humor, everyone blames poor ol Bitcoin lol
