go ahead ban exchanges it will only make crypto more scarce are more valuable 
@_date: 2017-09-13 20:45:26
again, lol its not about exchanges. do you understand economics? if for example the government makes alcohol illegal, retailers might want to dump their stock cheap, but will also drive up the price of alcohol. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 03:52:17
duh did you read the analogy I said. when alcohol become illegal retailers will try and dump their stock. doesnt mean buyers dont want alcohol anymore.

spoken like a person who doesn't have a bitcoin position 
@_date: 2017-10-07 21:08:47
doesn't that mean that in the course of using your nano ledger s you will have thousands of public keys? I guess also there is a limit to how many public keys can be created into existence though I'm sure that number is 10 to the power of 20 or something.
@_date: 2017-10-08 12:30:35
bit it's also possible to process many transactions and only ever have one public key.
@_date: 2017-09-14 03:15:35
no it will analogous because it will become illegal for exchanges to sell. it still stands. good try
@_date: 2017-10-16 06:07:42
thanks!  hanging my head in shame...

lol, it is going to make more difficult to acquire. I can't believe I have to spell this out. I thought most Reddit users had brains.
