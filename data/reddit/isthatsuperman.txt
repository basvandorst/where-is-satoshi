The masses are financially and technologically retarded. They couldn’t explain to you how money works if they tried, beyond saying I give you money and I get something. 
People have no clue what a blockchain is. They don’t know what a hash rate is. They don’t know what de-centralization means. 
But I can assure you if they did know how fiat worked and what the fed does to manipulate and keep the facade of value up they would probably say the USD is a sketchy currency. 
The way I see it for mass adoption to happen, your ordinary citizen needs to be smarter and educated on how the process works or Bitcoin needs to be dumbed down for the LCD’s.

The question you should be asking is do my taxes actually pay for these things? 
The IRS is not a federal entity much like the Federal reserve. It’s a private corporation owned by the IMF who is an agency of the UN. Our taxes are funneled through foreign entities siphoned off and re-dispersed again through the fed. You’re basically paying the interest on the loan of the money they create from nothing. It will never be paid off, and it’s not meant to be. It’s a closed loop system of debt control. 
We had a revolution because of this back in 1776. Most people don’t know this, just like most people don’t know the fed is it’s own entity not owned by the government. If more people knew this maybe they wouldn’t be paying their taxes either.

Couldn’t you just break the transaction up into multiple smaller ones paying different wallets? How could that be tracked?
@_date: 2019-10-25 21:00:50
I buy what I can. Better than having nothing. I’d rather keep my money in crypto than keeping it in a bank.

Bank roll management is a thing for a reason.

I see what you’re saying. But I think ideally, big corporations wouldn’t bother with it. It would be more widely used by small vendors and small businesses taking over for CC processing.
@_date: 2019-12-23 05:09:07
From my understanding when nano scales it scales toward decentralization by users creating more nodes. 
Companies would be incentivized  to use it to save on processing fees which = profit. 
Everyday people would be incentivized to use it because if they’re sending money regularly to family or whatever, with traditional methods they’re losing up to 5% of they’re money every time. They save money in the long run with no fees and don’t have to wait 1-2 days for that money to clear. 
There is a profit incentive to use it and run nodes for it it’s just a profit you gain from spending less and saving money instead of a direct pay out one. 
The way I see it is nano is good for small amounts under $100, BTC is good for larger transactions.

Idk. Central management scandals have nothing to do with coin technology.

I only use them to make plays. Then sell back into btc. The only alt I could probably take serious is nano.

Make a nice little poem with your seed words and hang it in the living room for all to see. The best place to hide something is in plain sight.
@_date: 2019-12-23 04:40:36
I would tend to agree. But you can’t say that instant transfers and no fees is not a useful technology. 
Bitcoin is the GOAT crypto but you can’t screw a screw with a table saw. 
Different tools for different uses is all I’m saying.
@_date: 2019-12-19 01:42:45
Don’t they do different things though? Are people pushing it as the main coin?
@_date: 2019-09-27 14:55:24
Essentially. But cheaper than coinbase or an exchange.

You can take away my SNL spot now.
@_date: 2019-09-27 15:02:10
Probably because it’s based on USD. Never thought about it, that sucks though.
@_date: 2019-09-27 14:54:07
Correct. Cash app is actually pretty cheap as well, they don’t charge a fee but will over value or undervalue the coin by 1-3%. Depending if you’re buying or selling.
@_date: 2019-09-27 14:47:29
The easiest way is cash app. Reputable and fast. Just transfer out once you’ve bought.
