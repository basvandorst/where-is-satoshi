Don't tell me - tell Circle.

That would explain the email I got from Circle this morning:

Only if that transaction is not subject to taxation.
How much money is lost to the public purse due to unreported transactions avoiding tax? [Around $450 Billion in the US alone according to the IRS]( That money could be used to either reduce government debt or, better still, reduce the tax load on the rest of the population who pay their taxes on time.

We probably do. As long as you acknowledge there are people out there who believe life is better for all if we everybody contributes to the greater good, then I'll acknowledge that there are people out there who want to do everything for themselves.

When did that happen? There are tax collectors in history going back before the old testament of the bible.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:26:58
But tax collection can [famously deteriorate into extortion without accurate accounting](
. For a tax system to be fair then all transactions need to be clearly visible to all parties involved, including the tax authorities.
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:48:33
So the free people doing this transaction should report the tax to the government voluntarily to make sure it's paid correctly?

Me, and the 200+ contacts I have on LinkedIn.
Your personal LinkedIn page is your resume and job-seeking network. It details your personal work history, skills and expertise and is not related to any corporate pages other than you listing them as an employer at some point in your career.

Or because it's broken, becomes faulty or just isn't what you expected.
@_date: 2017-08-18 13:31:31
Yes. But you just don't release your product until the payment has partial or full confirmation.

Can't you just lock the wallet using a password/passphrase and then just only out receiving addresses to your staff and on any websites you may use?

You can get a choice of card solutions in the UK for less than 2% fees. It's no longer a huge impact on pricing.

I've owned at least some Bitcoin since 2012 and watched the price over a long period. This feels a little more restrained and so sustainable.
However, I'll probably continue to hodl until I retire, as my Bitcoin don't play any part in my financial planning. They're just a nice to have.
@_date: 2019-06-21 23:42:21
Unsurprisingly it dropped almost immediately after, but I think there's a good long-term trend in play now.
@_date: 2019-06-22 00:07:23
Onward and upward.
There's been a steady (rather than sudden and excited) upward trend in Bitcoin's value over the last 6 months. Let's just hope it continues.

I'd prefer to see sites using Bitcoin natively.
@_date: 2016-09-13 14:37:45
The difference is whether regular members of the public can use Bitcoin easily, without having to transfer trust to 3rd parties.
Bitcoin is still cumbersome to buy, spend and receive. More sites allowing it to be used natively would improve its acceptance and encourage improvements in its use.

I've heard mixed reviews of scan - but I'll give them a go this time i think.

I won't use the apps my banks provide and I wouldn't us a Local Bitcoins app either.
It's a combination of security and a lack of need. My banks' websites are perfectly usable on a mobile, as is Local Bitcoins.

Also, enable 2 factor authentication.

The difference I was trying to put across is that if you use a normal bank account, credit card of PayPal then these will automatically convert into a different currency.
So, if you have a bank account in Hong Kong dollars and another in Pounds Sterling then it's simple to make a payment from one to the other - the banks, credit cards or PayPal do the conversion for you. If you want to actually have the cash then you can go into a Bureau De Change or a bank and convert your cash there and then. Yes there are fees or charges, but the process is simple.
It sounds as though you live in the US, where you may have more options to make cash payments. In the UK this is currently more of a challenge, and so adds to the complexity of using BitCoins.
Converting cash to BitCoins is a lot more convoluted, and whilst this is good for privacy it's not good for the uptake of BitCoins among the general public. You won't see BitCoins being used regularly until they're as easy to use as a foreign currency - and preferably no different from your local currency.

Only good for the US.

Blockchain.info is simple to set up as a wallet - however, buying BTC is a challenge since you can't use PayPal or credit cards. That's where the real difference lies.
