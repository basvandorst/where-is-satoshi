I was standing right next to him. That’s how I learned about bitcoin! War eagle

Literally my dream car, when did you invest and sell?

Thank you for the response! So there is a early gap bitcoin never filled? Also, that makes more sense in terms of daily closes on a traditional market. I have been dollar cost averaging, but am holding a decent amount of cash for that. Although we keep breaking resistance on all the shorter time frames and remain bullish on the long so I don’t see this gap being filled unless it’s the low after the next new high.

That’s awesome! Do you still dollar cost average?

The only real threat is if quantum computing could harness a 51% percent attack. We are decades away from that even being plausible though

Lol at the idiots down voting technical analysis. Just remember bulls make money, bears make money, and pigs get slaughtered. More people on here should cherish the opportunity to take  1% of your bitcoin and leverage trade based of TA. I HODL and still make money when there is a down turn.

Ahhhh fuck I’m in the same boat except I bought at 8k. I don’t know why I can’t pull the trigger

Love the editing, good job

Make sense.... and it’s to late. I have a heavy percentage of my bitcoin and ETH on Robinhood because of the no fees.
@_date: 2019-06-11 03:57:08
This is so dumb it’s funny
@_date: 2019-06-25 02:32:19
Does anyone use Robinhood to hold on? It’s unfortunate you can’t transfer it, but the charts are great
