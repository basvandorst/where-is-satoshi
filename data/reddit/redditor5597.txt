next time autofocus on the main subject (cake) before taking a sharp photo of a striped chair in the background

Get a decent office/swivel chair man. That thing you got doesn't look that ergonomic.

I just registered to say that it looks bad without a passepartout. Never ever frame a piece of art like this. Always use a passepartout - will look 100% better.

It's real. It's a commercial for  a german online shop. Was just shown the commercial on youtube twice in half an hour watching random videos.

The framing is really, really bad. Pictures almost always need space - meaning a passepartout is mandatory.
Just look how close the motif is to the frame!
No matter how good the motif is - the eye-catching bad framing just turned this into a mess.
Better framing could look like this:

You have to document your trades if the Finanzamt wants to see proof but yes, it's 100% no tax at all if you hold for at least a year.

Doesn't matter if you sell into fiat. Each trade counts. Trading from ETH to BTC? It's a taxable event if you didn't bold the ETH for a year and made gains by selling ETH and buying BTC. Many people don't understand that in Germany crypto2crypto is the same as crypto2fiat in terms of capital gains taxes.

Why are there 2 different colors for the bars? As if they stand for different items.
The graph now reads like: "2053 ATMs: yesyesyes, 4000 ATMs: nonono".
WTF. Who creates such shitty graphs?

It's ext4, not NTFS

he's not mounting the filesystem via network. It's a hard drive attached via USB.

Please supply the output of the following commands:
    lsblk -Pp -o NAME,MOUNTPOINT,FSTYPE,LABEL,UUID,SIZE,OWNER,GROUP,MODE | grep /mnt/hdd
    grep /mnt/hdd /proc/mounts
According to google "Structure needs cleaning" means it's an ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystem and that filesystems seems to be corrupt.
Look into the output of command `dmesg` to see if kernel is complaining about IO errors.
Let me guess: It's an USB thumb drive, a SD card or something like this? These aren't designed for constant rewrites such als chainstate leveldb.
You need to identify the device (maybe `/dev/sdb1`; the `lsblk` command will tell you) and then stop the bitcoin daemon, stop all processes accessing `/mnt/hdd`. Then run fsck to check the filesystem for errors:
    fsck -fC /dev/sdb1 (&lt;-- use the correct device here!)
You might be better of formatting the device if the only contents is the corrupted bitcoin blockchain (backup the `wallet.dat` if it contains coins!)

Using a better power supply will most likely prevent future corruption on file systems on disks attached to your raspi but it won't magically fix the corruptions already made to the filesystem.
You're right to replace the power supply. after that you need to eighter reformat the disk (`mkfs.ext4 --force`) or fix all errors on it (`fsck -fC`).
If, like you said, you have the blockchain on your PC then formatting the disk and rsyncing it over might be the best option.

His filesystem is corrupt. The bitcoin.conf is no help here.
@_date: 2019-05-09 21:30:35
Just umount it first like I wrote above... oops, I forgot to write it down, my bad:
    umount /dev/sda
This will not work if processes have files open. Make sure bitcoind is not running.
From dmesg and lsblk it's a corrupted ext4 filesystem
