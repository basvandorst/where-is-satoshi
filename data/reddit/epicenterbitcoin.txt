Well the 2x increase every two years is roughly equal to Moore's law (slightly more conservative) so that makes some sense. The 8MB is really arbitrary, but it's not like there is some scientific formula or method that people can agree on to come up with the 'right' number so any number will be arbitrary. 
Personally, I'm worried that this is too conservative, since 2018 is very far away and if we assume that Bitcoin will become widely used then demand for transaction space will likely far outpace the growth of the block size.
It's definitely better than staying with 1MB and it might at least buy enough time for off-chain solutions like Lightning Network to advance, but I think an increase to 20MB and then a set increase schedule would be better.
