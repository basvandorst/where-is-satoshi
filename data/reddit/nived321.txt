It's 2014 and for the last month weve been bobbing around $600
The bubble to $1200 was just that, a market over corrected and crash b/c Mtgox came down, there are still calamities coming sure,
But take Argentina for instance they suffer through an inflation rate of about 30% per year.
Or western union leaching off foreigners, keeping those people poorer, thus making more need to more north for work.
Or just the sheer ingenuity 2 billion people will bring to the global Market, there are things we take for granted that simple don't exist in these places.

@_date: 2014-01-31 01:28:28
This theory doesn't take into account that demand comes from the work force. 
    If the work force isn't demanding goods and services, 
    the supply of workers goes up. 
     
    Meaning unemployment, and less business for all, 
    except the cheapest competitor.  
Also the increase in Oil prices during the early zero's cause extreme strain on the work force, the labor market should have also adjusted, but employers felt no need to increase the value of labor with inflation relative to everything else, Government should Regulate fair market practices, if they fail to do so.... the system becomes unstable it will and has collapsed.  
Minimum wage must rise with inflation, or by the end of the decade there may not be enough demand for the workers in all sectors except bare essentials. Leading to only low wage sector jobs for skilled and unskilled employers alike.
      For example once upper-middle class sector jobs such as Aviation Mechanics, and Aeronautical Engineers, 
    have been directly brought down to Lower Income, by the increasing cutbacks to the aviation industry. 
Less people to fly with less money. Skilled labor has been taking hits like this all over the country, because the lowest class can't afford to spend a dime. This is not post WWII model anymore, the one that was working, Because massive deregulation has disabled the rev limiters of our economy, and we are going to throw a piston. The drivers go fast but lose it to all the repairs(unless the Government bails them out), but the car itself will be busted up and useless.
  
Ford knew this, that's why his wages were highest in the country. His employees lived well, and spread the wealth. Rich Investment Bankers only invest in other rich Companies. Rich people are not filling the vacant middle class vacuum. The vacuum is increasing exponentially. We are on the verge of another collapse, The college debt bubble. We really should raise these wages.
Basically Minimum wage hasn't gone up for years but the price of everything else has. This Kills the Crab.

Also the Increase in American Inflation was caused by the massive increase in Oil prices, The American dollar is stapled to the Petro-Dollar. It's why we invaded Iraq, Saddam wanted to trade in Euro's, It's why American Black ops over threw Libya, Tunisia, and Syria. It's why shrewd Warhawks all over the country want to bomb Iran.
This isn't a bad thing, if you're an American, It's our dirty little secret. The printing of money doesn't cause inflation, because nobody wants to pay more for oil. The value of the dollar has increased in relation to the inflation, so we haven't seen that sharp spike in costs that we were all expecting.
   It's one of the rare benefits of fiat.

Less demand for production less demand for producers, its common sense.
I'm not against a free market.
Around 30 years ago a movement came into power in some countries that argued this waste and the social safeguards were holding the economy back and the prosperity of all suffered. They claimed that things had changed and markets needed to deregulated, social systems had to be cut back.
Well, the result is that the distribution of benefits have, surprisingly enough, gone right back to the way they were before the expansion of social programs in the mid-20th century. Albeit with notable differences. Now the powerful and wealthy could curry favor with politicians so as to have competition curtailed or business funneled their way through favorable legislation in addition to simply crushing the completion through market manipulation and sleazy tactics.
We don't have Comcast and Verizon because of corrupt politics, we have them because they are the result of the markets they inhabit. Regulations could easily improve our telecom industry, just look at any other developed nation to see how. Same goes for health-care, energy, etc.
An entire generation learned from the Great Depression and the wars that followed it a number of very valuable lessons in how to create a just, prosperous society. Then their kids came along, and saw all these rev limiters all over the place and decided that they didn't need them anymore.
Well, it's not turning out so well.

Non established, non asset, hedge fund groups will not find money without serious serious bullshit in their private placement memorandums... 
These hedge fund managers are like sharks that smell blood. They may cause the price to drop, as they pull capital out of bitcoin, that would have otherwise been invested in bitcoin... these brokers probably get 20% commission sometimes more.
They are a cancer. This is actually bad for bitcoin.

Miners are still making money, but we are walking a fine line, if we don't upgrade quick enough we fall behind. It your continuously upgrading your hashing power, and if you can do this faster than the next work difficulty increases your going to get larger. You still make about a third of your money back in one month, if you put this into more hashing power, you can catch cheaper prices for more power, think compounding interest.

Bitcoins became a Commodity, and dark markets used them for value transfers, dark markets are still around... Bitcoin may be volatile but it still works.
The reason we see the price decline, has to do with the dollar being strong. The Petro-Dollar... The cost of oil has dictated world commerce for the last 50 years. Oil 
Is a one stop shop for agriculture, transportation, and goods.
The price of oil is $47, but at the beginning of 2014........ $110.
Oil lost half its value over the course of year, drilling projects have been put on hold, and investors are moving their money into other prospects.
What made Gold valuable for a store of wealth, it didn't degrade...
Paper money doesn't more than ten years.
The  value in Bitcoin as a store of wealth, entire departments in a bank are dedicated to things like wire transfers, fraud, and savings. The Bitcoin protocol does all of those thing for free, with out a controlling entity. The value has changed, but show me any person who would not take 100BTC 
 It did not tarnish or Rust. 
There is a whole mess of other things like the un-banked Billions... But the price needs to come down before that happens.

Pools cannot choose which transactions and blocks to mine... 
A fifty-one percent attack has to flip a coin for each new transactions block... If the block is solved by the 49% inside on 100 transaction confirmations then the double spend or what stupid shit you people think the miners would do would have to be 1/2 * 1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2.... One hundred times... The chances are too insignificant and the drawbacks include loss of faith in the system.

First of All, Traders not miners are causing the damn volitility, Exchanges have cause far more instability than the miners. Miners Pay up front for the Privilege to mine Bitcoins. and all the small operations are dying off and larger mines are being consolidated...  
The same amount of Bitcoins would be created no matter how you slice up the mining. Larger transaction blocks means more transaction fees in a block, not higher transaction fees. And this would help out all the little guys...

@_date: 2015-08-27 17:53:16
No the reward pretty much stays the same if you double the transaction size it doesn't necessarily mean all those transactions will have transaction fees... As it stands with 1 MB the transaction fees barely make it to .1 BTC... So nobodies getting more money in any significant portion.

2.5 peta hash increase requires 2 million dollars... The facilities to house these operations need to be massive, the locations to host these operations at competitive rates are far and few between... Iceland, Washington state, China cheap power is not the only factor you need industry experts working around the clock for a month or two to roll out a 2 peta hash operation.
 The Chinese simply don't have the knowledge base to build and run them as efficiently as possible, 500% increase while not impossible represents over 1 billion dollars in infrastructure build out.
What you will see are on going operation throwing out their old hardware for new hardware, which requires man power.

If wages kept up with inflation like the system was designed to, it would be easy to pay back your debts as time went on,
If you get a 200,000 dollar loan for a home, in ten years, the 200,000 dollars would be worth less than when you originally got that loan. All things deteriorate with time, including that house you bought ten years ago, you would'nt pay 200,000 dollars for that house again ten years later. Don't get me wrong when banks tack on the interest rates it gets a lot harder to pay it back. But money that inflates is not meant to be saved, Bitcoins can be saved and expected to increase over time.

Well that's fine. I'm just saying... It acts more like a commodity than anything like gold... 
but you can't instantly trade gold online, and gold can be manipulated by governments (Nixon), and banks. see [Gold, Silver ETF's](
 The supply of bitcoin cannot be manipulated. The dollar can be, infact the dollar isn't a store of wealth at all, so bitcoin doesn't want to replace nothing(dollar). Bitcoin could replace gold, human kinds age old wealth storage metal. Bitcoin can be divided easily and gold can be divided easily(soft metal). Bitcoins don't degrade over time, like gold. Gold is heavy and hard to trade in large quantities, but there is an unlimited amount of gold in the solar system. 
Lots of gold is found every day, 
  Bitcoins are found every day and sold, but there could only ever be 21Million bitcoins, think 210billion tons of gold. we can divide them and speculate what its real value is when in reality bitcoins and gold are about the same.... you cant eat it, you can't use it for anything other than trade, and the price is determined by the idea that that guy over there will want some so he can give it to someone else who thinks its valuable like gold. The Fiat version of the dollar was supposed to replace Gold, now gold altogether needs to be replaced.

I have access to a few banks that can provide bitcoin international debit  cards.
Could you create a system that automatically sends a transction to an exchange?
So the bank only needs one exchange account for all the bitcoin transactions, the card would send 1 bitcoin to the account and the account would automatically sell that bitcoin on the exchange..

You're both a little off the mark; fiat is money that has been **loaned** by a central bank at **interest**. 
The debt of creating the supply of bitcoins is assumed by the bit miners, Bit coins are never loaned to issuers or exchanges from a central supply.
**You cannot own fiat**, you can only use the implied loan to exchange for **percieved** equal force of said fiat. (This is basically why it's illegal to destroy fiat, bacause it was never your's) 
**TL:DR** fiat is currency with artificial inflation (interest rates) 
**TL:DR extra**means your $17,000 loan today will be easier to pay off in 10 years. A bitcoin will not inflate which is why it can be traded like commodities.

As long as there are people willing to hold all there worth in bitcoins will be around for a long long time, if legislation comes around, the price will fall but your initial investment will still have value....
Bitcoins are the first commodity ever created to be able to be used worldwide without any real country to country friction, that potential mixed with the ability to keep holdings in a digital capacity is revolutionary.
However i do not think bitcoin can ever replace fiat. Bitcoin is well on its way to replacing gold as the staple of wealth commodity, you cannot manipulate the supply, there is no fear of a run on the banks for bitcoins because the more you withdraw the higher it goes, now the possibility of really big money getting into bitcoin could increase the price astronomically. Imagine if just one of these internet billionaires desides to convert his wealth to bitcoins. At this point would cause a domino effect between the oligarchy of the world. Banks around the world are subject to localized economics callapse, bitcoins are not. 
Bitcoin is just starting to gain traction, people the world over are dumping millions into mining bitcoins.... this is the gold rush of our time and is really amazing to be apart of. 
  The rule of 100 monkeys is fast approaching for every hyper-inflated fiat holder in the world. When something is created that makes the a world a little bit smaller it will be adopted in droves. Even today thousands of wires cleared the international banking systems and caused a 20 dollar surge in price. Hold on folks bitcoins are entering the ionosphere and prepareing to leave orbit. Bitcoins here to stay and any early adopters will have very happy grandchildren.

 However, Bitcoin **At it's core** was created out of necessity, draconian laws on certain goods is one aspect. The transparency factor is a bonus, and the cost basis for extracting more supply is a factor in price increase. The ability to cross continents with one currency is also a bonus. The value of the bitcoin economy is based on solid assets, That's all that matters. Bitcoin can never find itself beholden to debt, because it's suppliers cannot charge interest (Miners), so the currency will always go up relative to fiat currency. Right now the bitcoin has not stabilized, because it is still not trusted in the market, Even though relative to the banking industry, Bitcoin is largely designed as ANTI-TRUST.
