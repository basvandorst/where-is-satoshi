I find it strange that he didn't invest in LTC

You are right, there are two zeros too many

One of the transaction I mention is for buying a hardware wallet, and I am waiting for the confirmations so they can ship it.

I have a problem with bitwala's no hidden costs. I have contacted them but they are not giving any reasonable answer to me.
 At   the prices are listed as follows
Physical Card issuance &amp; delivery Per Order € 8.00
Virtual Card Per Order € 2.00
but at  the prices are listed as
5 EUR for the virtual and 10 EUR for the physical
What about the no-hidden-costs ?????

I read this article  and I am between Bitwala and SpectroCoin. SpectroCoin has no top up charge, but bitwala has no transaction fees. I cannot find any info about transaction fees for SpectroCoin. Has anyone any clue ?
@_date: 2017-05-20 15:06:55
I did not get the amount back. The transaction were not rejected by the network but they were pruned from the blockchain.info database

I do not really like moving my money around. I think I will wait for the hardware wallet. I do not want to take the risk the same think to happen with my whole wallet
@_date: 2017-05-20 15:33:21
So, the transaction DID happen, it is still unconfirmed, there is no proof that I sent the amount since it is not in my history...
How do you explain it. Were the fees to low ? It was set to auto. Does it  has something to do with the Memory Pool ?

So, I contacted SpectroCoin and asked the following:
" 	I am interested in purchasing a plastic card from your service and I want to ask if there are any fees per purchase transaction. Also you mention that there is no loading fee ? So if I understand it correctly you only charge me 1€ per month, and 0.5% + €1.00 if I buy bitcoins from within your service ? So If I transfer bitcoins from my wallet to your service, it is free?
No fees per purchase ?"
The answer I got is: 
"The fee to unload is 0.5% + 1EUR. Other fees are the same as you stated."
So this means that you get charged for every purchase but in bitwala you get charged only once per top up. I think this settles it. Bitwa.la it is !!!

Ok. Will do that

The same thing with a second transaction of mine:
@_date: 2017-07-01 08:31:56
1225$ on your door seems pretty low. I am living in Europe and we pay customs + shipping + power supply. Is the price correct? Can anyone else verify it ???
@_date: 2017-07-01 09:57:07
You could add more info on the post. A list with all the parts, links, photos of your setup..
@_date: 2017-05-05 20:37:29
I found a comparison at  They have reported scam about SpectroCoin. Anyone ???
@_date: 2017-07-01 09:48:26
I dont think you got my point. I have many miners myself from bitmain. But I paid a lot more than 1225$ for one miner. This is only the price you pay on bitmain without shipping costs, PSU and customs. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 22:15:50
Will I have a problem with bitmain's miners? You mean we should not buy from them just so we dont give them more money or will have issues with their miners?
@_date: 2017-06-16 21:03:41
Why should we boycott Bitmain? I have some old miners from them. Does that mean that they will start mining on another blockchain by themselfs?

I had an issue lately with a refund. Instead of returning the coins I send, they returned the bitcoin amount adjusted with the current exchange rate. I lost about 30€ in bitcoin. If you want proof, here is the original invoice with the refund address 
As you can see the original amount was 0.057523 BTC and the amount returned is 0.043339 BTC (
