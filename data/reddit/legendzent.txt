I believe this is the new binance coin that is used to trade instead of using your bitcoin. If you use binance (which I don't and never will ) you can swap your bitcoin for this bullcrap and trade with this I stead while binance locks up your Bitcoin and says its SAFU Lol

To me seems like these exchanges are trying to own every last bitcoin with these stupid trading pairs so that when they are all gone they can name their price.
@_date: 2019-07-26 15:09:50
Yes They've had it for a while now. They also have ETH, BCH, DOGE, ETC, and  XRP but you still cannot trade XRP

@_date: 2019-07-26 03:06:56

There's a few bitcoin ATMs in Detroit and when BTC recently hit 8,500 they were selling it for 9,000 or if you were withdrawing cash the rate was 7,800. Makes me consider buying one since I know a lot of people who own liquor stores here Lol might be a good investment

Serbs are nothing more then rapist and child molesters. They are the scrum of the earth. Kosova is free from this and independent and will always be. We kicked the filthy serbs out of our country. And our King freed our people from the Turks and took our country back. Accept the facts and kill yourself you stupid fuck  
@_date: 2019-11-11 01:50:55
Fuxk Robinhood I bought $2k worth Bitcoin  and they spotted me another $2k so $4k total. I doubled my money and sold within a few months. When I sold my BTC they kept the $2k they spotted me which of course I expected that and I was fine with that but when i transferred all of my money into my bank account to then buy REAL BITCOIN now they're saying I owe them another $2k because of the profits I made from their $2k spot way after the fact . I had no idea

Real Bitcoin HODLers will not sell at any price. The purpose of Bitcoin is to hopefully in the near future use it instead of this digital shitcoin called the USD. Every business in the world will accept Bitcoin as payment so that Hopefully we don't need to sell it.
@_date: 2019-10-07 11:49:05
I'd start using it when one bitcoin is worth millions of dollars and is accepted anywhere

Hal Finney recieved the first Bitcoin transaction. Think like Satoshi for a sec. He remained anonymous because he was afraid of the CIA and Federal Gov. I personally believe that Hal aka Satoshi had a split personality when developing Bitcoin and sent the first transaction to his self. How convenient a man named Satoshi Nakamoto lived few blocks away from Hal in California.

American Congressman Suggested Facebook Should Adopt Bitcoin as the Digital Currency on its Platform
Here is original post. Congressman Warren Davidson, in an interview on Noded Bitcoin podcast on Oct. 11, suggested that Facebook should drop Libra and adopt Bitcoin. He added, users seek freedom and look to avoid corporate control. Implications of Facebook adopting Bitcoin instead of Libra may be huge for the price of Bitcoin. Do you think Bitcoin is the way to go? Will you have Bitcoin in time?
