No, you can be online at different time, the other peers will deliver the message when the receiver comes online. 
It also work like Bitmessage and hides the message recipient by not specifying the message target's address. Every peer tries to decrypt every message and if its successful then it saved as sent to him/her.

If the scalability become problem anyone able to create a new network of messages by cloning the zeromail site (just create a new site, copy the html/js/css files and you done), but my old core2duo cpu able to decode 13000messages/second

Well, probably it has some weakness, but I think currently it's still the best solution: 
@_date: 2015-12-18 01:49:26
IPFS is more like a static file system, ZeroNet is built for real-time updated, multi-user websites
Storing large media files is not really possible in ZeroNet yet, IPFS has good support on that.
@_date: 2015-12-17 21:16:54
Sure :) The site's full source code is here: 
@_date: 2015-12-17 20:57:33
No attachments yet, but its definitely possible.
ZeroNet is using the same (BIP32 based) cryptography as Bitcoin: every site and user is identified by a valid bitcoin address, so for example you can send bitcoin directly to other user's or sites address and he/she able to collect it. 
In the future it could be possible to sign your content (eg. your sites, messages) using hardware bitcoin keys (eg. Trezor) to enhance your security.
Also it uses Namecoin (also developed by Satoshi) as domain registry.
@_date: 2015-12-18 02:00:45
You only able to send/receive from/to users of ZeroMail site.
@_date: 2015-12-18 13:49:16
The old messages can be omitted. You don't have to send between sites you can download the other site and add your message there. To list the messages in one place it will be possible to create "merger" sites that able to list all your served zeromail sites messages in one place and make look like as one page.
This also makes the system more decentralized not only by content distribution, but also by site ownership. We have to stop building huge, monolith sites/networks.

ref code if you want to support me: 
@_date: 2015-01-13 10:13:39
It should works if you able to install python-pip and python-dev packages , then running `pip install pyzmq gevent msgpack-python`
@_date: 2015-01-12 22:39:04
Basically its a webserver running on your machine and only accept connection from you pc.  
Its possible to make open ZeroNet gateways so anyone can access zeronet sites without installing or running any software:  
To make one you have to start it by `--ui_ip "*"` command line parameter (not recommended yet, no multi-user and authentication support)
@_date: 2015-01-13 20:26:57
I was able to reproduce the problem and its fixed in latest version.
I'm planning to do an "unpack and doubleclick on zeronet.cmd" version for windows bundled with all the stuff its needs running (+autoupdate the source code from github)
@_date: 2015-01-12 21:27:05
Its not intended to replace every current site, but to create a new, decentralized web publishing platform.
Currently eveone has every update/data that connected to site. To support big sites its needs some kind of partitioning.
@_date: 2015-01-14 11:17:27
No file splitting support yet, but could be added later.
For small files (&lt;1MB) its easier to download the full file again than patching the current one. (torrent also does this)
@_date: 2015-01-13 11:57:38
Thanks for reporting, opened an issue at github for it: 
I will look at it later today
@_date: 2015-01-14 13:55:40
Good idea, I try to contact the current owner maybe he give me admin rights.
@_date: 2015-01-12 21:49:42
If you have some peers hosting your site already then you only need to connect to 1 peer util the new files transferred to him/her, and then they distribute content between each other.
If you can hide your ip for that short time (using tor/proxy/etc) then no, its not possible to track down the owner.
@_date: 2015-01-12 21:00:39
The DB is also hosted by every peer: data/1Gfey7wVXXg1rxk751TBTxLJwhddDNfcdp/messages.json
Currently the message sends using standard http, but later bitmessage, tox or something decentralized could be supported too.
 - When you send a new message you post it to a http bot that holds the private key for the site.
 - The bot adds your message to messages.json, signs the new content then publish it to the peers.
The realtime notifications using WebSockets on localhost.
@_date: 2015-01-13 13:05:39
Yes, its very similar to bittorrent: you are helping to distribute the content you downloaded.  
If you don't want to "seed" it anymore you can simply delete the site from data dir. (I will add this feature to webui too)  
You can hide your ip with Tor or something like that or maybe later with open ZeroNet gateways.
@_date: 2015-01-13 11:49:53
@_date: 2015-01-12 20:23:11

I really appreciate if someone donate to my project, but in fact i'm not really interested in money, i can buy everything i want to own.

@_date: 2015-01-13 21:36:05
Currently in passive mode its only updates if you manually press the update site button.  
To remove just delete the site from data dir. (Remove function will be added to ui soon)  
You are right, the pause is currently for only stop accepting new updates for the sites. Created a new issue for it @ github, I will fix it soon.
@_date: 2015-01-14 22:07:46
Here is the rest of it:  :)
@_date: 2015-01-12 21:22:50
If the private key compromised you only lost the site address. You can create a new address with new private key and your site will lives on.
Its not connected to bitcoin network/miners in any way. Its only using Bitcoin ECC cryptography to generate address, private keys, sign and verify content.
@_date: 2015-01-13 11:26:41
Please let me know if anyone successfully started it on OSX, so I can put it to readme.
@_date: 2015-01-12 23:00:45

No, current frontend/backend sites wont work, but its possible to write a blogging platform for zeronet
@_date: 2015-01-13 01:31:13
Thanks you, if You have any other advice please don't keep it yourself :)
I try to keep it as simple as possible (currently around 1500 lines of python code + 500 for ui) and put comments everywhere. Any code review also welcomed.
@_date: 2015-01-12 21:42:47
Thanks! :) Multisig not yet supported, maybe later...
@_date: 2015-01-13 20:15:03
Unfortunately none of current blogging platform going to work.  
All site has to be static html,js,css. File writings later could be supported using zeronet websocket api.
@_date: 2015-01-13 20:41:04
It works without open port too, but you wont be able to receive real-time site updates.
@_date: 2015-01-14 10:01:54
Thank you! :)  
At the current stage there has to be a bot that process requests, update files, signs new content.json using the private key and publish it to peers. Later it could work like this:  
* Newuser to ZeroReddit owner bot: Hello, i would like to write messages to ZeroReddit, my public address is 1NEWUSER.
* Bot: Creates user_messages/1NEWUSER.json and updates content.json that says the other peers can accept modifications to that file that signed by 1NEWUSER's private key
* Later when Newuser wants to post new message he adds it to user_messages/1NEWUSER.json, sign it and publish to ZeroReddit peers directly without contacting the bot
ZeroNet sites are independent like .torrent downloads, so no reason to create smaller networks.
@_date: 2015-01-12 21:17:40
Its a proper bitcoin address and the private key could be imported to bittorrent client too. (but i havent tried it, so please dont send any money to it :) )
And i theory vanitygen could be used to generate readable ZeroNet addresses.
@_date: 2015-01-12 21:05:17
Wow, thank you! :) 
@_date: 2015-01-13 12:05:18
Yes it works in passive mode too. (You wont receive automated realtime site updates)  
At the startup it tries to open port on your router (using upnpc-static.exe), but you can disable it by starting using `zeronet.py --upnpc=` command line.
@_date: 2015-01-13 00:23:11
Thank you! :)  
I know there is some projects out there and its not as advanced as 7-8 years old projects, but i wanted to keep it simple and started it less than 1 month ago.
I think simplicity and the content is key for everything. I will focus on creating new sites and open gateway support, so anyone can try it without installing anything and if he/she likes it maybe downloads it and become member of the network.
@_date: 2015-01-14 12:28:42
I'd rather stay using plain text (json) files yet.
Sometime in the future Sqlite db could supported using ZeroNet websocket API to speed up zhings, but we are not there yet and as we know: Premature optimization is the root of all evil :)
@_date: 2015-01-13 09:39:55
Yes DHT is planned (among with peer exchange)
Passive mode is supported, at startup it tries to open port on your router, but if its failed you still able to use zeronet but you wont be able to receive the site updates in realtime. (and you get a warning message about you are not full member of the network)
@_date: 2015-01-13 10:18:30
I dont have access to OS X computer, but I think:
* You should install [brew](
* `brew install python`
* `pip install pyzmq gevent msgpack-python`
* Download, Unpack, run `python zeronet.py`
@_date: 2015-01-13 00:47:02
Thanks for heads up, I going to change it to sha512.
It could be possible with RSA, but I don't see any drawback using ECC. I like the Bitcoin community and the speed is not a problem yet (only used to verify small file) even using pure python ECC library.
(btw.: [cloudflare switched from RSA to ECC because of the speed](
@_date: 2015-01-12 21:15:21
Yes, i thinging to change the starting 1 to Z to prevent the confusion.

Why don’t we apply the lessons of quantum mechanics in a hardware that uses some of the tricks of quantum mechanics? Dr. Hirotaka Tamura, Fellow, Fujitsu Laboratories, introduced the Fujitsu Digital Annealer (DA). It’s not a quantum computer but quantum inspired, and it can be used for combinatorial problems. It brings many benefits of quantum annealing, but is based on standard digital technology. The DA has 1024 bits, but has full connectivity to other bits so resembling quantum mechanics. Fujitsu is working with partners like Canadian start-up 1Qbit and with the University of Toronto for the software development. In the future, the DA will be 100000 times faster than conventional processors; right now, it’s 17000 faster than conventional processors. By taking Moore’s law, 17000 faster means 14 generations. This means that Fujitsu’s DA beams us ahead by 14 generations.
We can do disaster management and mitigations, molecular research, radiation therapy in the human body and much better models of machine learning and artificial intelligence. As quantum states cannot be copied, quantum networks are safe.
Until quantum computing is available to all, Fujitsu’s Digital Annealer can be used to build a better, safer more prosperous world for all. The future is much brighter with Quantum Computing.

If you use torrent and change any of the files of your site you have to create a new a new torrent file and make all of your visitors (seeders) to download it.
In zeronet its also possible to give users permission to modify and sign/publish his/her own file this makes commenting/upvoting/etc. possible.

Zeronet is similar to torrent, but different protocol. You can have dynamic web pages because peers is grouped by site owner's public key (bitcoin address) and not by the content's hash like in torrent.
ZeroNet is not limited to web apps, you can use it to distribute any kind of files: binary, source code or you can use it for a live updated GIT repository that is not possible using the torrent protocol.

I messaged him at reddit, but no answer and could not find any other contact to him.
But I checked the project and it points to the project bitcoin address (1QDhxQ6PraUZa21ET5fYUCPgdrwBomnFgX), so i think it should be fine.
I have created a [donation page]( where you can donate toward specific goals.
@_date: 2015-04-10 19:11:08
Unfortunately you have to download zeronet client to access zeronet sites.
It's possible to run a zeronet proxy that makes available the content to anyone without downloading anything, but I don't know any of it running yet and running the client locally is still the preferred way. (make the network better and you own your private key)
@_date: 2015-04-09 23:24:52
There is many things that has to be solved to make it work better in bigger scale, but its not an issue yet and it will be done when its become a problem.
But its already working you can try it by downloading the client.
@_date: 2015-04-09 22:58:21
It's not supposed to replace current client&lt;&gt;server infrastructure, its just an alternative distribution platform.
Currently suitable for low-storage sites like forums, blogs, webshop etc., but its under active development and later more data-heavy site could also work.
It could be also ideal for high latency connections (meshnet, anonymity networks) because everything is stored at your computer, so page load times is instant.
@_date: 2015-04-10 00:17:03
The update process speed is only depends on the peers speed. But there is lots of space to optimalize it.:
Currently the whole file is re-downloaded every time it changes, but later its possible to make it faster by only send the changed lines.
Probably its not ideal to real-time sites where the changes has to reach all peers within small time, but I think this problem is not affects most of dynamic site (forum, blog, social network, news sites etc.)
@_date: 2015-04-10 09:29:28
The address is only valid within ZeroNet, so you can access the site using  after you started your zeronet client
