I think OP is saying that there was a drop last year and we recovered.
@_date: 2017-03-17 21:43:23
Yes &amp; yes. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 21:52:27
Lol. Good stuff.

First of all, I never buy more than I'm willing to lose.. With that said, I have missed out on so many dips. I'm kind of like the scared guy in the front line of Braveheart when Mel Gibson is saying Hodl(hold). Bitcoin is the standard of digital currency. When we make a copy, we say "Xerox", when we ask for a drink, we say "can I get a Coke."

I have Swype, so it's convenient.

Sounds illegal.

Well said.

Volunteer at a rehab one of these days, it's disheartening and sad.
@_date: 2017-05-22 19:43:58
Maybe, but... Come by and see what people are dealing with... Might enlighten you. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 19:42:37
Not at all, join me for a day at rehab.
@_date: 2017-05-22 19:41:09
Nope, guns are cool, owned by sober people��

I used to time the market... Lost a lot of $$$. Then I read something recently from an educated person that said not to try and time it. So now I hodl and I'm finally ahead.

�� stuff. Thanks for sharing. But we're all allowed to have an opinion. I guess I am little bias working at a drug rehabilitation facility. I'm not against drugs, but access through the dark web is probably not the place. Cheers bro.

I'm not against responsible drug use, the small town that I was raised in has been destroyed by meth. The real issue here is Russ, there had to be something more productive to do with his time rather than make money off of drug clientele and issuing a hit on someone. There are really good non profit organizations Russ could have used his talent for. He is not a martyr, he is a notorious drug lord who got greedy.

What about all the domestic abuse, not to mention the drug rehabs that have to deal with the aftermath... Also, would you want your kids to have that ease of access to drugs. I think the punishment is excessive, but try raising a family, it will change your moral judgment. Can you tell I work at a rehab, and have kids?
@_date: 2017-05-22 20:48:02
Can you tell I don't care, that you don't care? ❤ 
@_date: 2017-06-12 21:10:22
Good analogy, seriously. BTC is sort of Microsoft, Eth is Apple :)
@_date: 2017-06-21 21:12:31
Typical.. Everyone tries to panic sell at once, what a bunch of noobs. Hodl weaklings!
@_date: 2017-06-21 23:18:38
@_date: 2017-06-14 12:53:05
Oh boy, what if your totally wrong? Bitcoin is spent, eth is where it's at in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-06-21 04:59:52
It's been one day... Chill dude.
