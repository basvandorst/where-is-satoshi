I'm there with you! Or at least was, when I discovered bitcoin back in 2011. Blockchains and the things you can do with them excite me much more than bitcoin does these days. Bitcoin may fall, it's not even the cryptocurrency with the best technical specs, but blockchains will remain and be used in ways we haven't even imagined yet. I consider it to be a truly revolutionary invention in line with, say, the printing press or the steam engine.

For example,
* Which cryptographic algorithm that is used for the proof-of-work (for example, Bitcoin uses SHA-256 and Litecoin uses scrypt).
* Whether proof-of-work or proof-of-stake (or something else) is used (compare Bitcoin with Peercoin).
* The frequency of block creation (higher frequency leads to higher security against double spending but also to a longer blockchain, everything else being equal).

A blockchain without incentives is insecure (or, at the very least, very prone to insecurity), but there are other incentives than monetary value. See Ethereum for example, where ether is needed in order to run the programs.
I definitely see your point that bitcoin is currently the best cryptocurrency because of its huge network, but that's not a technical specification of the currency, it's just a description of its current state. That can change. (Not saying that it *will* change, just that I certainly see it as a possibility, since there are other cryptocurrencies with better specs.)

You are essentially describing a less sophisticated version of [OpenBazaar]( Check out Development is slow, but it's getting there!

Something like this, just a quick sketch in Solidity:
    contract Equity {
      mapping(address =&gt; float) ownership;
    
      function Equity(uint shares) {
        ownership[msg.sender] = shares;
      }
      function reassign(float fraction, address recipient) {
        if(ownership[msg.sender] &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; fraction &lt;= 1 &amp;&amp; fraction &gt; 0) {
          ownership[recipient] += fraction * ownership[msg.sender];
          ownership[msg.sender] *= 1-fraction;
        }
      }
    }

But that's not how equity is supposed to work, is it? Please correct me if I'm wrong, but shouldn't you be able to transfer your part of the equity without the approval of anyone else?

It's definitely doable on Ethereum, just store the fractions for different addresses and have a function which lets them reassign their shares.
Edit: grammar.

Actually it's looking like [a few days](

Ah, sorry about that then. Afaik there are plans to support them, but you could easily do with just ints as well. I'll leave that as an exercise for the reader. :)

No probs! Just head over to or  if you need any help. :)
