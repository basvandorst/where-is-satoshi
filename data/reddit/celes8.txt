You should use dynamic fees because the network sometimes gets suddenly flooded with txs, and it will be annoying to calculate the right fee each time you want to send a tx.
I personally use dynamic + 60% fee multiplier.

Your analysis is incorrect.
The March 11th deadline concerns a rule change that BZX is proposing that would allow the COIN etf to be potentially listed under their exchange. On March 12th, we will know whether or not the rule change has been expressively approved or passively passed through the federal register.
In either event, its passing does not guarantee anything wrt to COIN's s1 etf application. They are not necessarily mutually exclusive.

its the same. bats is the company, bzx is the exchange they run
@_date: 2017-02-08 06:55:35
There is no deadline for the s1 COIN etf application. it can sit in the SEC's desk for eternity.

One of my most favorite copay features is that it locks the send address once you insert it. On a smartphone, thats such an essential feature because of how easy it is to mistakenly input something on the ui.

I'm happy you got your btc out, but even though I do consider $100 alot of money I just can't accept it in good conscience. You had all the tools to recover your wallet and you deserve all of your btc.
My advice would be to use mycelium or copay on your phone with a backed up seed written down somewhere. 
@_date: 2016-09-06 07:04:22
Electrum doesnt use bip39, so recovering an electrum seed with those wallets wont work. Youll need to use electrum
I'm kind of confused first of all. If you have your 12 word seed, you dont need to run electrum off the usb. Just boot into windows/osx and you will be able to recover your wallet with a new electrum install.
Second, if you have your password, you will be able to export your private keys, under the wallet tab.

and then 3,000,000 when the IMF is forced to buy bitcoin for the SDR basket.
@_date: 2015-09-14 05:42:22
then i googled "bitcoin forum"
found bitcointalk.org, and realized that it was very international.
at the time, it was basically worthless, and i didnt think much of it until i read somewhere a few months later that it spiked to $10 or something.
then i decided to understand how the blockchain worked.
when i fully understood its political and social implications for the emerging world i looked into buying. If Gox did not have their original hack/panic/ solvency question (iirc summer of 2012) i would own a lot more bitcoins because it scared me off and i bought less than i planned/wanted to at the time.

It will appear on the federal register before the sec page
Yes, you ought to consider that the two events are not mutually exclusive. However it makes no sense for the sec to approve the rule change without a finality to the s1 application. Meaning that I would not expect a decision until the s1 is further amended to fit into bzx's 14.11 rule.
There are rumors that progress is being made on both sides that will require the s1 to be further amended. If/when this occurs it will be a very strong signal that the etf is imminent.

If Jorge Stolfi gets to message the SEC, get quoted by them in this response, i am 1000% certain that everyone else is qualified to send in their thoughts.
He's a blithering idiot who lies about bitcoin, yet they spent an entire page today on his message to them.

in the ruling
"Pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)(B) of the Act,53 the Commission is providing notice of the grounds for disapproval under consideration. The Commission is instituting proceedings to allow for additional analysis of the proposed rule change’s consistency with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,"
here is section 6(b)(5)
(b) Determination by Commission requisite to registration of applicant as a national securities exchangeAn exchange shall not be registered as a national securities exchange unless the Commission determines that—
(5) The rules of the exchange are designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest; and are not designed to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers, or to regulate by virtue of any authority conferred by this chapter matters not related to the purposes of this chapter or the administration of the exchange.

Your seed is used to create your actual wallet (and thus, private --&gt; public keys) that you see in electrum.
For instance, if your computer HD crashes, or you no longer have access to the computer, the only way to recover your wallet is to have your seed.
No seed = no backup
no backup = forever lost coins if something happens
You do not need to remember your password to restore an electrum wallet, you will be permitted to use a new password with your old wallet, assuming you have your seed.

Sure he is a professor, but likening bitcoin to a ponzi scheme is simply a betrayal to his academic integrity as an educator, author, and scientist. As such, he demonstrably is a blithering idiot. His cause and basis for his arguments are completely null. We all know this.
Bitcoin is rooted in the fundamentals of mathematics, social contract, and script which binds every actor which partakes in its community to be a fair actor. 
I write this as someone who has actually been published in a peer reviewed journal.

why woudl you do that, thats dumb. 
if you have an extra smartphone lying around, I guess you can physically remove/destroy the wifi chip and lte chip which makes it safe from the internet, but thats more trouble than its worth.
Just write it down somewhere and put it somewhere safe.

From Chamath Palihapitiya, we know that Zuckerberg is very much aware of bitcoin. Obviously bitcoin can have a transformative effect on social media, and I think Facebook is just waiting out to see how the digital currency ecosystem grows before they jump in. It has unbelievably enormous business implications and Zuckerberg is playing it best--- just shutting up and letting it develop. Whether he actually views it as a good/bad piece of technology is irrelevant. If the ecosystem grows, he will be forced to integrate it. And as he seeks to connect the next billion people onto the internet, bitcoin &amp; digital currencies &amp; web wallets will be the key that secures all of those people onto facebook.

I'm a huge proponent of increasing the block size, but bip101 is not good enough.
Neither is a floating point block size, because it does not protect miner's well enough fees.
Where i agree witht he blockstream developers is that we need a final solution, but it is so incredibly diffiuclt to model bitcoin's tx increases.

What wallet are you using?
Just export it into something that actually works. Like Electrum if your desktop is secure, or Copay or Mycelium on your phone.
Look at blockexplorer, and pay the right fee.

1. From an enduser perspective, Gemini has nothing to do with COIN
2. The longer $gbtc stays as a premium, the greater the odds are that decision makers at the SEC will be swayed (if a decision hasnt already been made). Because premium indicates demand. High demand indicates a void in the marketplace that can be filled.

This article needs to be saved and looked back on in 10 years time.
The best bull case for bitcoin is that it actually becomes unbelievably hard to buy/get for the typical person. All bitcoin related products are simply derivatives-- such as an ETF, or some global fiat that is backed by gold, bitcoin, etc that is issued by the IMF.

They'll need consent from the DOJ most likely because the govt has no control over the asset. There are no existing laws that control movement of Bitcoin unlike other commodities (or fiat or money or assets)
So if the DOJ decides that Bitcoin is or isn't something we'd have a conclusion on the form of position we would know about it because they would release a declaritive statement concerning how Bitcoin is viewed from the govts perspective. 
A lack of position indicates two things: 1- they are undecided. 2- the issue has been moved up to the executive office. 
I consider 2 highly likely. Bitcoin is completely in the hands of the president's office. Either it stalls there and no decision is made (likely) or he paves the way.
