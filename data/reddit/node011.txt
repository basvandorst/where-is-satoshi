Why are you so aggressive ...
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:01:42
Surely there should be provision for once off micro-transactions?

nearly 4k in 5 minutes

That's just what we need is a healthy correction and then yes definitely a new ATH!

More smoke an mirrors again?

My point is that until we see instant, free transactions bitcoin is overvalued. RSI technicals indicate that we are in an overbought position at the moment
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:01:30
Truth is it is faster and cheaper to use

Uh oh, someone isn't going to be happy...

Well it's being used for one purpose: A store of value. You can't even buy $10 worth of bitcoin and transfer it to someone else. hmmmm..
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:27:41
$3000 in 3 minutes

Don't care about bitcoin? Sorry you're very wrong there. I've been involved with the project for years and I'm beginning to see some worrying signs. I could be completely wrong these are just my observations 
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:55:56
For one you can start by sharing that absurd amount of bitcoin with me :) I wants your coinz
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:17:12
Cool now everyone can tip me ;)

This is the sort of stuff we need to validate bitcoins price tag. Bitcoin can only be worth 11k with a stronger technological foundation
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:29:28
There are many people that are investing that don't care about Bitcoin itself but see the gains and want in
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:24:32
That guy with the hat is nuts but in a cool way :)

What is bcash?
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:09:50
Wait so you're telling me there will be no way to send a dollar in bitcoin once off to someone?. I am aware that the LN network isn't solely designed to resolve the high fee issues but why does core need to feel like we need to sit on our hands and pretend like there is no solution to this problem? Why are some scam cryptocurrencies able to accomplish this?
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:06:01
That's not what bitcoin was originally designed for
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:15:42
Exactly, this is how I feel.

When Katy Perry visits Warren Buffet to ask him about bitcoin I think not
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:59:06
You can't compare Bitcoin to stocks or gold. Bitcoin is a unique asset class that whose value is derived from it's use. A company's stock value is derived from that companies productivity and performance. Bitcoins productivity and performance hasn't been the best as of late. Yes I am excited for lightning but until then I think bitcoin is overvalued.
