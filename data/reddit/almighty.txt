It has to be on gdax otherwise it doesn’t count ��

There’s no way to know unfortunately...

Yes more or less

When/if bitcoin hits $91K or so, Satoshi will be the richest man on the planet.

I’ve always loved litecoin, not really for rational reasons. I like litecoin

If you’re not sure, maybe invest just 1/10th of the amount you want to invest, then 1/10 next week and so on. This way you mitigate the risk

You mean $750k!

Absolutely. And since OP hasn't told her when he started, it was probably for a reason. So I would tend to think that he shouldn't tell her.

Even of it doesn’t crash, this wasn’t a smart move. Never do this kind of all-in whatever you investment is. 
But I suspect you are just trolling arent’ you? 
Just sell your btc so that you don’t hold more than 10% of your net worth in btc.

it took about 8 min to get from $17K to $18K

On Kraken BTC is at 12.5K€, on Gdax it's at 14.64K€. That's about +17% difference. Lots of room for arbitrage though I wouldn't use Kraken too much these days

Ignoring the old system, and building the new one, so that when the old one crumbles, the new one is already in place...sounds like a pretty good strategy to me. No need to participate in the existing system too much (vote, etc.)

The opposite is true though : when bitcoin rises, the alt coins soar.

The amount of people asking the thief for donations in the comment of the article..."go Robin Hood, go Robin Hood"... That is ridiculous.

Although I don't necessarily share your opinion, I would just underline that your opinion on banks doesn't matter as much as your actions. By your very actions, you're part of this. I believe most bankers take a defensive stance like you do, saying "but I have to have a job right?". No you don't, you really don't. This is an excuse, you can still take some time and start working somewhere else, although it is not easy of course...Anyway, good luck to you (I hope I didn't sound to mean or anything, this was not the point)

Kraken's good for EU residents and € sepa transfers

excuse my r/bitcoinbeginners question...but doesn't that mean that bitcoin is not that anynomous if someone can find the identity of someone else so easily?
