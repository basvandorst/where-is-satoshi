Dockerizing Bitcoin is a decent enough idea but why the altcoin? Do you imagine this as more of a very redundant whitelisted environment than a currency? Do you do anything to simplify the management of the whitelist?

Another interesting relationship to track is price and mining reward versus electricity supply. A high Bitcoin price can cause electricity prices to spike. This is improved with each halving in that this constraint of the price of Bitcoin keeps well, halving.

B/c you need on-chain to open and close the channels.  The only reason to close one is if the other party to one of your channels is unresponsive for a significant period in relation to your channel's lock time.

More than the impact of slightly fewer in relative terms coins entering the market will be the psychological impact that yes, Bitcoin will follow it's halving schedule. This even in the face of fairly clever and persistent social attacks against the currency. With two halvings under its belt, people will trust even more that the supply is limited, forever.

One important thing you may be overlooking is that LN security depends on Bitcoin security. What LN does is enable Bitcoin to scale to a level that can actually pull in much more revenue and does this in a way that doesn't necessarily threaten its decentralization and uncensorability.

@_date: 2016-04-10 19:23:36
Fair enough. The other way I'd look at this is about security of the network. Are fees plus block rewards enough to secure the network against the biggest attacker? I bring up LN because it's unlikely for the above to be the case when one on-chain transaction represents just one end-user transaction.

Since eWork shares many characteristics like irreversibility and censorship resistance with Bitcoin, I'd like to see more people working for it. This is why Rein (was created.

All solvable problems. Lightning will make micropayments a reality and at that point you can pay for 10-20x redundant hosting for anything. Rein hopes to pioneer this model to build a decentralized labor market but it's broadly applicable and a similar but more optimized model to website hosting in general.

This would be a decent use case for a multisig escrow through To start someone would need to post a job to fund a QR code tat. Then OP can bid 0.3 btc. Mediators are standing by. 
@_date: 2016-04-14 01:36:30
For sizing, a good way to do it is make each payment a new channel where all of the funds are pushed to the other party. Then you'll be paid up to that entire amount through that same channel. This effectively turns large merchants into natural routing hubs. If they don't route back through then maybe you don't shop with them via lightning in the future. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 16:27:39
I had the same dream and built Rein. The software and system work and it's designed for decentralization. Even used it to pay some devs to work on it. 
Current issues are that it requires python package install to setup, and fees can make small jobs not economical, however since the platform charges no fees itself it's not bad vs 10-20% you'd pay for legacy sites. I'd love to see lightning support this year and mobile apps but need someone passionate who could help pm it and manage devs. 
@_date: 2016-04-04 20:46:01
That would be its own market. Try to do some math on how many transactions of what kind of value you have to do for it to make sense.
@_date: 2016-04-14 19:48:47
I'm fairly sure that without limited block space,  Bitcoin will fail to be useful for the one thing it excels at, uncensorable transactions. 
You basically have to compare on-chain fees with the real world cost of being able to transact without someone stopping you. Think suitcases of cash that get confiscated versus don't. Or cost to setup enough shell companies to move fiat electronically.
Add in Lightning that may allow that same power to scale without negatively affecting privacy and you start to understand why Bitcoin us facing such resistance. 
@_date: 2016-04-10 18:56:03
I don't think it's about a specific measure of value but  what's needed to reasonably use Bitcoin trustlessly. A typical user under the lightning scenario may need several on-chain transactions a year to open and close channels or deal with unresponsive parties. If the fees to be able to do that become too onerous - like more than a few % of the total value transacted for that hypothetical - then I'd say the fees are too high. 
@_date: 2016-04-15 19:24:01
Block reward transitioning over to fees as has always been the plan. Since on-chain transactions will be relatively rare vs lightning (even in a bigger block future), those fees will be higher but since they can be amortized by the user over tons of lightning transactions, the overall cost to use the system will be negligible versus everything else.

The problem you describe is best handled by reputation. The remaining issue is selective scamming where the vast majority of trades go right but one party scams on a small enough set of them to not be taken seriously by the market but which still adds to their bottom line.
If the product is not fungible or reversible (as with gigs and their deliverables) then the remaining risk is greatly reduced. 
@_date: 2016-04-14 04:56:34

This is about learning how Bitcoin works. 
There is a blockchain and it keeps track of who has what. 
If you don't have the full chain, you can't be sure. You are probably trusting someone else.
It's very simple but important to understand. A light client may reduce initial confusion but at this point we need to prioritize user understanding over user base.
Bitcoin will not happen in a year or two. This is generational and it goes better the more people actually know how it works. We should be teaching the blockchain in school.

With all due respect to  a website cannot be effectively decentralized. Someone has to choose what will and won't be there. It's up to the community to educate itself about what should be trusted in the Bitcoin world. Hint: it has a genesis block. 
Edit: my point to the downvoters is not to argue with bitcoin.org. That is futile. Instead, think about how you'd recommend people learn about and download a wallet to use Bitcoin. Hundreds of attempts have been made to build Bitcoin portals. Why haven't they succeeded? Is an incumbent site with a good domain name that powerful?! If so we do have a problem and Andreas may be understating it.

I would 100% encourage you to build things for Bitcoin however you can. If you can run a full node and interact with bitcoin-cli, great. If it's just accessing others APIs, fine. 21 makes 402 and offchain payments work seamlessly but that's just one, albeit a new and exciting, avenue of Bitcoin dev.

The 1,000,000 byte is hard coded in the consensus rules so yes, it'll have to be a hard fork that changes that.
@_date: 2015-12-03 01:55:00
The limitation is due to the IoT vision and regulations. Until people can start to have persistent payment channels ala lightning, offchain is the best we can do for micro-transactions. I believe 21 disallows outside coins entering their offchain system so they don't get hassled for aml/kyc.
I think a lot can and should be done to build similar 402 handling against Coinbase and other APIs that allow sending satoshis.

True. I was working on this idea but there are multiple dimensions of unknown effects to deal with. Do large blocks cause bad centralization? Do small blocks badly hurt adoption?

Empty words. If you want to be a big node, then you will need capital. I'm pretty sure many nodes will be started with just a btc or two to see if it's profitable just as someone might have tried to setup a small isp years ago. To be clear the alternative isn't just to increase the block size. Thar be centralization dragons on both sides. It'll be a combination of scaling solutions that help us all minimize centralization risk and provide as much economic value as possible.

If a logjam ends up being demonstrably bad, then that will encourage agreement on change. Basically the situation has to evolve to a clearer, more urgent state before the hard fork code should be adopted by anyone. I think people assume everyone is static in their arguments but with time the space between those along the spectrum should decrease if a policy change is necessary for the system.

You shouldn't be so concerned about the health of the network. Whether you're an individual or business, the purpose of running a node is so that you don't have to trust anyone. Perhaps harder to convey but reduces this conflict between privacy and wanting to help the network. 
If you want to help the network, mine, develop software/services, or buy the coins.

Whether the business is a good idea is as they say, in the details. There's a pretty good post on Bitcointalk by Mircea Popescu which may not hold true anymore, and I can't find it, but basically it said you shouldn't worry about exposing your idea. If it's a good one the rest of us will be happy that you're taking care of it and if secrecy pre-launch is an important part of your business plan then it might not be a strong business. 
The main point though is to try and be very critical before launch so you don't waste yours or anyone else's time. It sounds like you're doing that. If you care to share any more detail then I believe the community can help save you some grief.

To date nobody has really painted a picture of what life looks like when there are two active blockchain forks of significant length so let me try. 
Imagine SPV nodes not knowing which fork the node is on that they're talking to. Some nodes saying they have money and others saying they spent it. Also imagine outputs created prefork being sold at exchange or to individuals once on each fork. This means immediate dive in price for both sides of the fork. Do you want to bet if their prices add up? I bet not. 
This business of whoever's in the economic majority seems to make sense but is wrong. Bitcoin just doesn't fulfill it's promise at a fundamental level when there are two versions of the blockchain running on the same p2p network, sharing a common ancestry, but with a distinct and permanent divergence.

A better way to look at this is probably how much in fees will have to made up per transaction at the next block reward halving. It'll be 12.5 btc / 1620 transactions per block = 0.0077 btc or $1.85. 
The interdependency of block size and the block reward may lead us to make any changes we do to the block size limit at reward halving or shortly before or after.
@_date: 2015-06-12 16:26:29

With a non-consensus hard fork, people would be undermining the consensus model. The consensus model relies upon everyone using the same basic rules for the system. When those rules are disputed with a hard fork that leads to a persistent split of the blockchain, Bitcoin's consensus is broken. More needs to be done to describe the effects of this scenario which appears to be growing in likelihood. 
For example how do SPV nodes behave? And if prefork coins can be sold on each side of the fork, how will that affect the exchange rate?

As Meni Rosenfeld said, "A limit that can be set by the miners is no limit at all". The 90% for a time would seem to make unilateral change harder but since it's not specified would this be a 90% floor (i.e. the largest max_blocksize that that fraction would agree to)?

The first effect is that coins can be locked away for a number of blocks. This should reduce liquid supply and provide an additional dimension to securing ones coins.

It would mean some nodes and miners on one fork and some on the other. Transactions would be confirmed in different blocks on each fork or not at all. SPV clients might get conflicting information from different nodes that they connect to. Once newly mined coins have matured and spent, two completely incompatible histories would have been recorded making reconciliation impossible. Loss of confidence would probably fuel a large price drop for coins on either side of the fork, miners then have to turn off leaving their hashpower available for purchase at a discount by an attacker. This is just off the top of my head but this does deserve more research.

It's about malleability. When a payment channel is opened, an anchor transaction is created that can refund whoever is committing funds to the channel. If that anchor transaction is malleated, I'm not sure if the channel just doesn't open and the funds are locked up for the duration or if it opens a channel that is just hard to find and transact upon. In so far as anything depends on a transaction ID, malleability screws that up. Maybe it has to do with the two way HTLCs. I'll have to look at it more to give a better answer but I hope that helps.

Not to call anyone out but Mike's stance seems to be that an upgrade will simply follow an economic majority. This ignores that an economic minority's only option is a nuclear one. Why force anyone toward a nuclear option when circumstances may change enough over time (i.e. with demonstrated transaction delays or fees that prohibit mass adoption) to where near unanimity develops naturally? 
With a non-consensus hard fork, people would be undermining the consensus model. The consensus model relies upon everyone using the same basic rules for the system. When those rules are disputed with a hard fork that leads to a persistent split of the blockchain, Bitcoin's consensus is broken. More needs to be done to describe the effects of this scenario which appears to be growing in likelihood. 
For example how do SPV nodes behave? And if prefork coins can be sold on each side of the fork, how will that affect the exchange rate?

There is some risk of that but there are other uses for XCP that are more important in its valuation. Namely that XCP is the main token-of-value in the Counterparty system and some transactions such as bets, contracts for difference, and asset calls must be settled in XCP. 
On the demand from issuance side, 4227 assets have been created so far which burnt some 2000 XCP in their issuance. Versus a total supply of 2.6 million XCP, this can't have had a big effect on XCP trading value.
In my opinion, the main value of XCP comes in trustless trading where I put in an order to buy XCP that gets automatically matched against your order to sell FLDC for example. This two-step form of trade on the distributed exchange can only occur by trading one Counterparty token for another. XCP can be skipped by trading a token directly for bitcoin in a BTCpay transaction but that requires that the user make their payment in bitcoin within 20 blocks of an order match so takes an additional step.

The nice thing about the ATM business model is that operators only have to be concerned with the money transmission laws in the states they choose to be in.

That is a risk. Right now it costs 2.5 mBTC in XCP plus the Bitcoin miner fees to register a token. Later issuances require no XCP, just the miner fees. That 2.5 mBTC equates to about $1. Since it's a one time fee and it would likely be associated with an enterprise that would be worth far, far more, I don't think it's a problem even at 100x of what it is now. 
If it were a problem and the community wanted to reduce the fee, then that fee could be reduced with a software update. It gets interesting then if there is some sort of dispute but as long as tokens aren't created in spammy amounts, I doubt there would be much objection to lowering the XCP fee for registration.
On the colored coins side, every transaction has to pay just the miner fees. The problem I see with CC is that it's limited to just sends. Since there is no database being built on top to keep track of balances, decentralized trading, trustless exchange, and all the betting features are either impossible or very clunky. 
At least that's the conclusion I came to when I evaluated all of these 2.0 things a month or two ago. I'm following them all and trying to stay on top of developments so if I'm missing something, I'm always interested to hear it.

Dogecoin has two interesting things going for it. Dogeparty and merge-mining with Litecoin.

If you're not familiar with Dogeparty, it's a clone of Counterparty on Dogecoin proposed by the Let's Talk Bitcoin folks.

XCP isn't needed for name squatting. There are still bitcoin fees and anyway it's unlikely the actual name will be a deal breaker for any token. Fee-free issuance of random names is being implemented now to that point. XCP's primary purpose is to be a token of value that the protocol can escrow.

darrenturn90 is only correct in a way. Counterparty is a protocol for embedding and decoding financial transactions in Bitcoin transactions. Take the asset creation transaction for example. It encodes information on the asset name, quantity issued, if it's locked, if it's callable, etc. into a compact form and puts that data into a Bitcoin transaction. That data may be encoded in prunable multisig outputs or it could use OP_RETURN data (right now, multisig is used because not all mining pools are on board with OP_RETURN). Once the transaction is confirmed, all Counterparty nodes, decode that data, check if it's valid (doesn't create a pre-existing token name, doesn't spend funds it doesn't have, etc), then inserts it into an SQLite database that Counterparty builds and manages. All of the data in that database is derived from data in valid Counterparty transactions that were confirmed into the Bitcoin block chain. Nobody can mess with that database without getting those Counterparty nodes to disagree on the validity of a particular transaction. 
I hope that makes it a little clearer. The system is called embedded consensus because it depends on Bitcoin to provide a singular stream of transactions along with consistently applied rules to interpret data embedded in those transactions.

Thank you very much for this write up. The process taking 45 mins or so is definitely not what you expect from an ATM!
It is however understandable since they really will want confirmations from the Bitcoin network before they dispense with cash. I guess the obvious speed up is to allow people to do as much of this ahead of time as possible.
If they could link with Coinbase, Coinkite, and other wallets they can also reduce or remove the confirmations wait time. People often misunderstand Bitcoin's utility in retail, thinking that Bitcoin network transactions are how they will buy tacos and beer in the future. The reality is that Bitcoin functions better as a backbone and other proprietary systems like Coinbase and Coinkite will be doing the instant and very low cost transactions.

It is still the case that those XCP were created by burning. You can no longer create any more XCP though since the burn process completed in early February.


No more XCP will be created. There are 2,647,060.58 currently. Some of those will be burned with the issuance of new assets, payment of dividends, and execution of these Ethereum scripts.


XCP was created so that the Counterparty system would have a default token-of-value that could be escrowed natively. This is what enables two-step trustless trading with any significant amount of liquidity, binary bets, and contracts-for-difference. XCP is also the currency used to call back assets (you can create assets with the option to call them back after a certain date and at a certain minimum price in XCP).
Calling XCP "just another altcoin" really depends on how broad your definition is of that phrase. XCP is unique in that it is not mined and absent a change to the Bitcoin protocol, is the only way the escrow-requiring features mentioned above could work.


The choice of a transport-layer blockchain has everything to do with security. If Counterparty were to switch to another chain, that would likely mean that Bitcoin were no longer the most secure chain. As unlikely as that seems, it wouldn't affect native Counterparty operations much except transactions may confirm in a different amount of time and any Ethereum-based operations with the underlying currency (BTC vs. the proposed chain) would need some special attention.

Colored coins have been in process for years and still they have a couple chief drawbacks. One is the ease with which a coin can be uncolored. Send it to Bitcoin-Qt and then out again and it's no longer colored...shares shouldn't be so easy to lose. The other issue is that they are quite limited at the protocol level and the most advanced implementation used on Coinprism uses their site as a centralized repo for much of the useful information.

It's an interesting idea. Thank you for comparing the burn period to Bitcoin's block reward schedule. The fact is, it's a different world. It took more than a year for Bitcoin to be forked but today, good open sourced code involving money will be forked in weeks. 
The developers of Counterparty had to seriously consider the length of the burn period. Too long and it would be forked to create a more aggressive group of holders with greater potential for short term gain due to the lifting of the one-way peg. Too short and there are accusations of a premine and not enough buy-in to grow beyond whatever critical mass was necessary.
It took me about 8 months to go rabbit-hole on Counterparty. I am sure that before that time, a fork would have appeared had the burn period been ongoing; Dogeparty started just as I was getting into it. So I really think the timescales involved do not favor a longer burn period. In addition, there is no capital investment in mining hardware to be considered. No multinational organization or government to outpace in mining.
We had secure digital currency and balances in a new monetary pool needed to be initialized. I think they did a good job given the trade-offs.
Still, the code is all there and forks are still possible. Do you believe enough in a longer burn period and have a capable team ready to fork this?

People don't really want to tie their wealth to anything. They want return and what you're proposing makes getting a return harder. As you may know the burn period ramped down the XCP/BTC over the month. More people *would* have had a chance to make an investment with a longer burn period but I think most of them would have waited until just before the end to better understand what stake they'd have.  During that time any number of things could happen which may have in fact decreases the overall investment *and* number of investors. A longer burn period adds uncertainty which is another thing investors don't like.
If you want your point to stand strong, it had better overpower that competitor apathy and in a big way. The Counterparty team is quite virtuous.

The USD conversion rate is probably most convenient.  shows Bitcoin having a market cap of $7.8B vs Dogecoin's $50m. 
I used the word "value" because some amount of coins is not equal to some amount of dollars. You can only pin it down once a trade has occurred from a cryptocoin to some other thing. The rate at which that is done depends on the buyer, the seller, their time frames, desired payment methods, risk, etc.

This is incorrect. Counterparty tracks tokens and balances separately from any specific output. Therefore, a wallet that is not Counterparty aware can't view or change anything, including deleting or losing tokens, in the Counterparty system.

There are lower cost ways to conduct financial transactions IF you are willing to trust a central entity.

So if blockchain-based tx/s don't keep up for everything, transaction fees will rise and people with opt to use other methods. In this case the Bitcoin network would be the backbone of the financial system available to interact with directly if it makes financial and technical sense for you.

I understand. What I'm saying is that the vanity part that one person can generate can be generated by anyone else as long as they wish to spend the computing resources. I looked at using vanity addresses for an exchange I ran and came to the conclusion that it would be a novelty at best and possibly dangerously misleading at worst. 
The vanitygen program is fine. It's free software and anyone can audit the code, at least the version anyone else should be downloading and using. 
What kind of puzzles me is that I have a totally valid concern about high-profile uses of vanity addresses. I do not want people to be scammed because they trust something of a form that they shouldn't. If it's GPG signed, that's another story because that's not trusting the address.

The only way Counterparty handles Bitcoin now besides small amounts for fees and outputs is with the BTCPay transaction. In that case, every other step of an order is done and the BTCPay transaction makes it final.
For example, using counterpartyd you can sell say 100 XCP for 2 BTC. The seller puts up the sell order. The buyer puts up a matching buy order. At that point, depending on other orders that are active, the protocol may declare an order match. At that point, the buyer has 20 blocks to pay the BTC via BTCPay. If the protocol sees that BTCPay has having gone through it considers the XCP to belong to the buyer while obviously the seller has received the BTC.

The usual fear is that something of value is going to steal value away from Bitcoin. I would posit that being able to be a competitive store-of-value to Bitcoin is an altcoin's key identifying attribute. So if an asset on Counterparty were marketed as the new end-all currency, then I'm sure it would be slammed as an altcoin.
XCP adds value to Bitcoin but isn't strictly tied to Bitcoin. What it really does is raises the stakes because if another coin ends up having a more secure block chain, Counterparty could move to that other chain. 
Counterparty is like a tenant of Bitcoin. It pays rent in the form of transaction fees, increasing Bitcoin's value, and chooses to be there for security purposes, but could relocate if necessary.
@_date: 2014-11-12 18:28:26
Bitcoin itself includes some basic scripting that has made it possible to send btc and to store it in multisignature addresses so more than one party may need to be involved to spend funds.
Counterparty adds an additional layer that lets people create tokens that can represent other things. These tokens can be bet or paid as dividends or used to control access to forums among other things. 
Today, Counterparty announces that they now include Ethereum's form of contracts that are in a Turing-complete programming language called Serpent. This enhances the power of Counterparty and of Bitcoin to being able to do lots of things that it'll take years, maybe decades to fully utilize.

It's true that fast and cheap trades will be done off-chain. Already MasterXchange allows trading of FLDC for BTC as an example of this. I think you can light up trading there for your own token for a nominal fee. On the back end, they had to setup the counterpartyd program for the first token they wish to trade but all the others can be added as simply as a new record in a trading pair table in a database.
As for the smart contracts features, I would expect that those mostly would occur on chain since the whole point of the system is to remove third parties from those transactions. Based on cost however, such contracts could be carried out by trusted third parties like exchanges and escrow providers.

1. For important things, it's best to run your own node. Barring that, checking a couple of places like blockscan.com and your Counterwallet should be good enough. 
2. If a node were to screw up their own database with false records that would only affect those who depend on them. So a malicious block explorer could make things confusing but there's no way they could get fraudulent XCP into your own or anyone else's node's database.

Anything that happens in crypto affects someone financially so I think we all have to assume that each of our positions have financial underpinnings. Personally, I'm about 15% XCP, 85% BTC.
That being said, Counterparty deserves serious consideration on technical grounds. It is like those first few times many people looked at Bitcoin for a few seconds/minutes, then months or years later went down the rabbit hole. Counterparty deserves rabbit hole treatment, not seconds/minutes and the sooner you entertain that notion the better I think it will be for you. Of course it doesn't hurt me either, just as people buying Bitcoin today doesn't hurt you (or me).

I believe Dogeparty will be great for lighter, more community-oriented uses such as crowdsales and rewards programs. Lower fees for the Dogecoin blockchain means there is a lower cost when lots of block chain-level transactions need to occur and Bitcoin's level of security isn't needed. With AuxPow, I would say Dogecoin and Dogeparty are made viable for all sorts of uses that were looking murky before. That being said, that platform isn't fully-enabled yet but it will indeed be interesting to watch.

It must be remembered that vanity addresses are a very pure form of novelty. You can't trust them because anyone can make them.  People really shouldn't make special vanity addresses for any specific purpose because just as in this case, it gives the attacker something to copy (even if they did a lazy job of it) to build false trust.
That being said, the original initiative is awesome and I'm happy to see Dorian S. Nakamoto may benefit from this craziness in the end.

I suppose the main reason this wouldn't work long term is that the new boss is the same as the old boss. One of the things Bitcoin has the potential to do (and which makes it more than a technical experiment) is to remove the role of central banks in the world's economy and financial health. The danger of a new govcoin is probably greatest once all the people who have been or will be burned by central banks die out....we're talking many decades from now.

Hopefully if you're storing a large amount of funds on an exchange to do a big trade, you know to remove the coins asap once your trade is complete. As for 2FA, there's always a reset process and that tends to be through email. So do you also have 2FA on your email? My point is just not to rely on nFA as something that can make up for other more fundamental issues.  your system must be secure(Ubuntu).  you should use strong passwords (keepass helps). Only then if you want more security should you setup your 2FA.

Crowdfunding. Crowdsourcing is where you have a bunch of people contribute work or services to get something done whereas here it's about funding the project. 
The decentralized innovation here is in using the Bitcoin protocol to hold the funds until some condition is met. I'm unclear as to whether that condition is complete funding or has anything to do with later approval by participants. Seeing the revoke button in the mockups leads me to believe you can only revoke before a project is fully funded. After that, the funds are delivered (with any extra going to miner fees) and it's then up to the funded entity to git 'er done.

I wouldn't say there's anything fundamentally wrong with multipools. They do what they do and some people come out ahead. 
The key downside I see to their existence is if a multipool owner wanted to kill a coin, they can easily overtake the organic hashpower of a great many coins' networks. So it's a fragility test if it is used in a certain way. Some small coins can be made profitable with not a lot of cash due to thin trading volume so that's another angle on killing coins that some actors may exploit.
@_date: 2014-10-06 22:59:44
To issue an asset requires 0.5 XCP but after that you are limited by the built-in Counterparty limits of ~93 billion for divisible assets or 10^8 times that for non-divisible ones. You can also lock the asset after issuing any amount so that no more can ever be issued.

You have a good point. Obviously the cost is greater so people would need to value that help or there would have to be some other way to offset that cost (i.e. higher fees, bundling with some promotions or training). At this point it's probably better if people have done their own research before holding any coins because securing them is non-trivial and scales in importance with the value of coins they own.

You could us a token in Counterparty. Setup a counterwallet for each user, create your company token, and send those tokens to each of your users. There are a couple things to note about this:
1) In order to send those tokens wherever needed, the addresses that hold the tokens will also need to have a little bit of Bitcoin to pay for transaction fees. Counterparty pays fees for each of its transactions which are on the Bitcoin block chain.
2) The anonymity you are looking for isn't really practical unless you use stealth addresses which are not supported by Counterparty or any other token-based system.
3) In this system, you can't control tokens being sent to non-employees. It might open up the possibility where an outside actor is able to commit a decentralized bribe on the company.
In this case, your secure database is probably better than a blockchain-based solution. You can even help with keeping your users anonymous by giving them a different id for each transaction. Would be interesting to hear how it goes for you either way.

I'm all for BTC purity and yes if you want to help Bitcoin you should buy directly with bitcoins from vendors who will hold the bitcoin until they can pass it on for non-fiat needs. 
Unfortunately this is early so short of convincing a local sports shop to start accepting the gift card route is probably going to work best for you.

You have the mathematical details wrong. It is not multiplication that is done by the miner to verify. Instead they use the public key that is included in the transaction to check the signature on the transaction.

For more information, search on "digital signatures" and you'll find articles like this:

It seems like a lot of this can be done already using Counterparty. At least the crowdfunding parts. The assurance contracts and return of funds will require third parties to say a task is done which is akin to Counterparty's broadcasts.

Realistically all you can do is reduce risk by trying to distribute the hash power until your own risk-tolerance is satisfied.

Thank you killerstorm for this. It's hard to explain such an in-depth topic. One secure separately-mined coin per hardware similar mining algorithm doesn't exactly roll of the tongue but it's an important concept. Really, if you want to make a coin that survives long-term, it's going to need to be most efficiently mined on some other hardware than what Bitcoin or Litecoin claim. 
The elephant in the room is Doge. It'll be interesting to see if there's anything they can do on the mining side to survive. Their price needs to gain on Litecoin's by 20x or so in the next year if they can't orchestrate a solution.

It's a nice idea but considering LTB has integrated to good effect with "snake oil" I see them going it alone. 
This podcast and the anti-appcoin argument are puzzling to me as Counterparty has clearly brought several use cases out already that prove there is some value to the extra features it has enabled, many of which would not be possible without a default token-of-value in the new system. The best I can think of Daniel here is that he is over-idealizing while pointing out the potential for scams hidden behind elaborate technological fronts.

If you send a Counterparty asset to bitcoind, bitcoind won't know how to send it out again unless you also install counterpartyd to talk to that bitcoind. The more likely way to get assets back out of that wallet is to dumpprivkey the private key for the address holding the asset and sweep that address into Counterwallet.
Basically, the way assets get sent is via specially constructed Bitcoin transactions that bitcoind doesn't know how to construct itself.

I understand. We need PoW to establish an agreed upon version of history. Counterparty nodes just need to interpret that history in the same way. Since nodes do not talk to each other, it really doesn't matter if one or many are doing it wrong as long as the services you use are doing it in the socially agreed upon way. It is a little confusing coming from a world of Sybil and 51% attacks. I think it would be helpful to quickly identify any differences in parsing though. So some sort of resultant hash after the parsing of each block would be nice to see.

Foldingcoin is interesting as it brings GPU activity full circle.

Your concern is that someone will steal a private key from your bitcoin node. Thing is, that private key doesn't necessarily need to be the key that can spend funds. It could be a key that is signed with the keys from your spending address. If this "network key" is compromised, which you should see from low payouts after your server is hacked, then only newly mined funds would be at risk. The older payments would be safe in your offline storage.

Yes. I think both processors provide the option for the business to hold some funds in Bitcoin so if you're concerned about your purchase contributing to price stagnancy you could ask the business what percentage of BTC they keep. 
If they go straight to fiat, then there's still the benefit of such and such did X amount of $ worth in so much time (like Overstock has published). If they keep the BTC, it shows a little more unity with the community and encourages them to pass the coins on when it can be used to pay for their expenses.

The issues I always had with Ripple were that I didn't believe in their consensus algo or in the idea of it being debt-based. 
Since it was issued in a proof-of-burn process, XCP is work-based like Bitcoin. The other part of the value proposition is that, in order to provide liquidity for trustless exchange and escrow meaningful amounts of funds for binary bets and contracts for difference, a token-of-value like XCP is needed. 
It will be interesting to see how Lighthouse implements escrow without involving a third party but this is what Counterparty does by only allowing trustless trading between tokens.

XCP is the default token-of-value in the system. In order for there to be significant liquidity for CFDs, bets, and two-step trustless trading, it is essential that XCP have value so incentivizing some holding is rather necessary. It's very similar to Bitcoin, in the case of remittances, where the liquidity(roughly related to market cap) places a cap on how much value it makes sense to transfer in the system.

It is created just like you can create a new email with one very important difference. Instead of clicking compose in your email program, putting in an address, and sending it, the miners on the Bitcoin network must do a very very very large number of calculations in order to create a new block of 25 bitcoins.
So it comes from nowhere just like the email but it is made real by abiding by the rules of the Bitcoin protocol, just as the email must abide by the rules of the SMTP protocol.

Counterparty transactions are Bitcoin transactions so they are broadcast and pay fees like any other. The alternative most likely to happen is that OP_RETURN data will be a hash into data stored on another p2p network. That does raise challenges though in areas that the Bitcoin network also helps with (attacks on the network, storage of nodes on that network). If anything will force this kind of development it'll be the cost of transaction fees.

I, for one, would not be satisfied with slipping through a loophole. There have been too many cryptostock platforms that have shut or closed off US use because of the uncertainty. In addition, Bitcoin's status wouldn't really matter if we end up talking about tokens that are represented by brokers/dealers/corporations as securities. I am sure the SEC will want to regulate that activity, hopefully sensibly, when that activity becomes significant.

The short burn period is a legitimate criticism but that decision required many factors to be balanced. Even though I like to track Bitcoin news closely and had heard mention of Counterparty, I didn't take seriously any of the Bitcoin 2.0 stuff until a few months ago. So the question is, if the burn process went on for 6 months or even a couple years how might that have affected the project?
1. Increase chances of a fork that might get pumped and IPO'd. = Bad.
2. Leaves open the question for investors, just how much of a stake they have.
3. Reduces the incentive to be involved in small but well-organized projects early.
4. Allowed more people to convert BTC.
5. Pegging the XCPBTC rate for the duration, depriving the market of feedback on what is an isn't working to help build the project, and disincentivizing exchanges to allow trade of XCPBTC.

The concerns about Bitcoin network transaction volume are valid but for retail scenarios like this it's likely that one or more centralized systems will take on this load and aggregate the money flows.

Counterwallet is the user interface to the Counterparty protocol. Counterparty transactions are embedded into the Bitcoin block chain and could very well work for this purpose.

The essence of this idea is delegation and revocation. It's similar to what happens with SSL certificates. They may be compromised so there should be a way to delegate that another private key may sign for any outputs sent to them and that their private key no longer may sign.

Counterparty and Mastercoin are very similar in that they encode transactions in the block chain and additional software interprets those transactions to build the current state of Counterparty or Mastercoin respectively. Colored coins attach extra data to unspent outputs that may or may not be preserved when those outputs are spent. For me, XCP and Mastercoin are more robust. Objectively, they are more powerful since much more data and state can be tracked via the use of a secondary database and such data cannot be lost by using a non-XCP or non-Mastercoin aware wallet.

If you do the math, and assume that a tip roughly creates a new user in some proportion then it really does make sense to randomly tip. What's funny is its not really about the number of people you tip.

If they used Counterparty, the ledger would be embedded in the Bitcoin block chain. They would create a token and lock it's issuance at some number of tokens and distribute to their userbase. Then when they want to pay dividends, they can do it in Bitcoin in proportion to how many reddit-tokens each Bitcoin address holds. They could also issue another token or tokens redeemable in the reddit store and pay those  as dividends a lot more cheaply since far fewer Bitcoin transactions would be required.

Because the biggest problem with this is that Storj tokens are irreversible just like Bitcoin. Exchanges focus on solving problems related to the interface between reversible and irreversible payment methods while also dealing with regulations (KYC/AML). So the Bitcoin exchanges would continue to take care of that part, while Storj tokens would most likely be traded for Bitcoin, Litecoin, XCP, or another currency that's already in irreversible land.

The first transactions that made it into that database and were encoded into Bitcoin transactions were payments to the proof-of-burn address. When the counterpartyd software saw those payments and that they happened within the burn period, it imbued the sending address for each payment with a certain amount of XCP. From the, the XCP, all the other tokens, broadcasts, orders and everything else have been tracked just as bitcoin itself is. Via protocol.

The only similarity I can see with Ripple is that they have something starting with an X. Ripple doesn't escrow anything, uses its own network for consensus and was premined. Who knows where Ripple would be had they started with proof of burn.

The idea was that there might be a weakness in one algorithm or the other but finding a weakness in both before people had a chance to move funds is very, very unlikely.
Incidentally, address reuse is a bad idea because the public key is revealed. When you spend "from" an address, you publish the public key in the transaction. Then only ECDSA protects your private key.

If you've followed Byrne's talks, his big issue is that the backbone process of settlement for securities trading is broken. In short, traders are able to promise to sell things they don't own and therefore pervert the market in a specific way. Overstock was the alleged victim of activity like this that crashed their stock price using imaginary shares. So that's what he's trying to solve.

A very simple analogy is rolling dice. For example to solve a block you need to roll a 6 twice in a row. If you have a whole room doing it, you might want to roll a 6 three or four times in a row. This doesn't take into account that hashing also includes the other data in a block but people can get an idea of how a process with random output can be used to create a distributed timer.

These assets are created with protocols like Counterparty, Mastercoin and nxt. The first two use the Bitcoin blockchain to store their transaction data. With these systems you can issue a token, say CHEESE and do various things such as issue a certain number of them, lock that issuance, provide a url or a small bit of text associated with that token, and pay dividends to holders of that token either in other tokens or in BTC. There are a couple of notable projects that are using these, namely Storj and Ltbcoin who use them for crowdfunding and as rewards for listeners and contributors. 
These tokens are also starting to be traded on exchanges like Poloniex,  an activity which is benefited by the fact that these tokens are secured by the Bitcoin network itself.

The plan was to use OP_RETURN to encode this data. For now, multisig is used because pools controlling a large fraction of hashpower are not mining OP_RETURN transactions. There was another wrench thrown in when OP_RETURN was limited to 40 bytes from the originally specified 80 bytes but this was worked around so it's just waiting for consistent support from I think 90% plus of pools for OP_RETURN.
Edit: As far as redeeming those outputs, I believe there is a tool that will do it, just not in bitcoind.

The currency they created is a token internal to their system and was done via a proof-of-burn. People sent bitcoins to an unspendable address to create those XCP tokens. A crowdfunding effort only needs $1 worth of XCP to work since that would be used to create tokens to be distributed to donators.
In regards to XCP competing with Bitcoin, it may but only once Bitcoins can be transacted natively with smart contracts, issue new tokens, pay dividends to holders of those tokens, do binary bets and contacts for difference. All of the above now work on the Counterparty platform. 
The operations that require the protocol to do the escrow(like the trustless distributed exchange that is also now working) use XDP for that value. It's conceivable that the Bitcoin core software could implement something similar but there are so many considerations with such a change it could easily be 2-5 years before we see those features.
Like Bitcoin, Counterparty takes more than a brief look but as an early adopter of Bitcoin who has evaluated each of these next gen projects, it has me just as excited as Bitcoin did when I first saw it.

Don't worry. It makes sense. A hash is independent from a signature. The signature is done on data that includes each of the previous transaction outputs (this is the money being spent) and effectively the address or addresses and amounts being paid. Then I believe all of the data including the signature is hashed just using SHA-256 or maybe SHA-256 twice.
The fine interworkings of this are what created the so called Transaction Malleability attack whereby the same transaction could be padded with additional data that didn't affect the validity of the signature but led to a different transaction hash.

For one this is a different type of key we're talking about. GPG vs Bitcoin's which is ECDSA. 
Secondly we only should have the public key. Satoshi would create another piece of data (the signature) using his private key but would never share the private key with us. 
A Bitcoin keypair can be used to sign a message as well (the one from the Genesis block would be acceptable) but GPG is the more conventional way to do this type of signature. 
To answer your question, if we had any of Satoshi's Bitcoin private keys we could steal the bitcoins controlled by that key. 
@_date: 2014-08-25 23:59:31
You should definitely wait for confirmations just as with Bitcoin. If there's a reorganization in the Bitcoin blockchain that could affect which trades went through and which didn't. 
Counterparty can only escrow tokens that are native to the system. So one reason is to embue the system with a minimum starting amount of liquidity for trustlessly trading. The other is to have a token of value with which to carry out binary bets and contracts for difference which can only be settled in xcp. 
Low transaction volume is because Counterparty seems to be operating as a dark horse. Very little marketing. No massive crowd fund for the development or IPO though if they had the btc to risk on the burn they'd be up 3x or so. 
When doing trustless exchange, coins must be escrowed for the duration of the order so yes it would hurt liquidity. Most exchanges do similar though so I think that's a minor problem. 
@_date: 2014-05-01 23:31:32

@_date: 2014-10-07 19:26:08
They are denominated in XCP so that the buyback only takes one Bitcoin transaction. This makes it feasible to do even when the call price is low and the Bitcoin fee is significant. 
If you wanted to have this sort of linkage, I think it could be done with a contract based on the BTCXCP exchange rate. Nobody is currently offering a broadcast with that information but it is conceivable that someone will offer such broadcasts in the future and build reputation in exchange for a small fee. You could then place a bet, which others could take the other side of, to hedge against BTCXCP.
The other way to do this is going to be by setting the call price to double what the trading value is now. If the price of your asset doubles you could readjust this call price by issuing a new asset with a further doubled call price, and paying that as a dividend 1:1 for the initial asset. You would then stop honoring the original asset and pass the equity-torch to the new asset. This is just a though... I haven't seen that discussed just yet.

, proof-of-burn is a big commitment and raises the stakes for everyone. That's why there's so much development activity going on with Counterparty. The investors have to pull to make
the coin work and they're pulling hard. They released alpha software and folks are losing money, but they're shipping code updates daily which means the software is getting better and the markets more active. This is an exciting space and this level of competition motivates a ll of us to take it up a notch.”

It being too late to change the title, I suppose it could be better stated as "bringing to the most secure chain". It is true that Counterparty introduced XCP as a new default token-of-value to facilitate some of these features and that this token invites some speculative activities (like me writing this). It may be that Counterparty as an extending protocol was just the most expedient way to get this code out into the world only to later be supplanted by native bitcoin core functionality. Only time will tell.
Part of my theory for the growing value of Bitcoin is that it will rise with the number of consumers of the block chain and therefore the value required in fees to publish to it. It doesn't rally matter they are using the block chain to track a rewards point or a bitdollar or a bitcoin

Honestly, there's never been a very good implementation that did anything exciting.

A good goal is for no three pools to be able to put together 51% of the network hashing power. So really, you shouldn't mine at any pool with more than 16.67% of the network hashpower. Right now this means leaving BTCGuild or GHash.IO if you're mining on either. Eligius, Slush on down are all fine. Check  if you're not sure if you're helping to keep Bitcoin's hashpower distributed.
Another approach is to join P2Pool which is distributed and decentralized by design. The rub there is that it's not efficient enough to be a big player. You can help this by donating to fund further development of P2Pool: 
Final thought, what if most of GHash.io's mining power is not from pool users but instead from their own hardware?

Counterparty cannot escrow Bitcoin but it can escrow XCP. XCP was designed as the default token-of-value for the Counterparty system, providing liquidity for trustless trading, bets, contracts for difference, and calling back tokens. If there is no XCP, or some other agreed-upon token that can be escrowed, then a lot of Counterparty functionality goes away.

I agree but would want to highlight that hundreds of cryptocurrencies already exist/have existed. So we have the experiment in place albeit at a quite early stage. The lesson so far has been that there will be a concentration of wealth and development resources in the top coins.
Buffet is the ultimate value investor. He wants to buy companies when they are cheap and to do that he needs numbers to look at. He says Bitcoin is a mirage but he may mean that it's more of a cloud or ghost. Any attempt to place a value on it is flawed as anyone who's tried can tell you. I used to think cost/transaction was good but then Cyprus came along and seems to have added a *store of value* term to the equation.
In any case, it's up to him what he thinks but once he realizes that it's very hard to value, then yes he would want to stay out of the coin investment business. I'm sure there are companies who will handle bitcoins that he would have no trouble investing in once the market matures. Most of his companies would benefit but those tactical decisions will need to be made for each company and in each department where it may have an impact.

After spending much of the day researching sidechains I think the issue is that sidechains take the training wheels off and open up a lot of unknowns.

It's still something I'm trying to wrap my head around.

In some sense Let's Talk Bitcoin is doing this since ads on their platform can only be purchased with LTBcoin. The distributed exchange is built into Counterparty. What mainly would be needed is someone who has a lot of ad space inventory to issue tokens representing units of that inventory and then who would consume an advertiser's balance of those units as their ads run. I'm not sure you'd want to go much lower level than that to start but it is an interesting use case. 
Seeing the market rate for the ad units would help the company price inventory better on a broad scale. They could also issue different units for premium inventory or by ad size or any other attribute if it became popular.

Actually, what you would need is a contract that ties ownership of the car to ownership of a specific Counterparty token. So you could register the MYCAR asset by paying a 0.5 XCP issuance fee. Make it non-divisible, non-callable, Issue only one token and lock it. Then you could place an order to sell that MYCAR for say 1000 XCP (about $4k right now) which would place MYCAR in escrow for the duration of the order. Someone else could then place the order to buy and if the orders are compatible in amount and price, their XCP would become yours at the same time as their order is confirmed.
You could also sell for BTC which just requires one more step on their end. Once the order is matched, they would need to complete it by sending the BTCpay transaction for 10 BTC. Once that transaction is confirmed, the token would be theirs and obviously the BTC would be yours. The BTCpay transaction is done automatically as long as the buyer keeps their Counterwallet open. Otherwise they would have to manually send it using counterpartyd.
The interesting part of this is what happens when you keep the BTC but don't send the car. They go to small claims court and show the contract and sign a message from their address which holds the MYCAR token and a huge educational experience ensues.

Bitcoin blocks are targeted at every 10 minutes on average but an hour between blocks is not all that rare. One long gap doesn't mean anything. For any meaningful info on hashrate, you probably want a days worth of blocks or more.
In regards to the policy question, should bitcoin companies and interest groups mine on behalf of their users? I wouldn't say so. Mining is going to be an increasingly specialized task to do well and it fits better with a for-profit operation model. I certainly wouldn't want to hear that an interest group I donated funds to used them to purchase(usually pre-order at this point) mining hardware.

It's a trade off. Yes, coinbase transactions may be larger but some pools used the coinbase in the past to distribute proceeds anyway. If could do a p2pool pool that would reduce the coinbase transaction size while not allowing the pool operator to manipulate which transactions are included then you'd really have something.

Bitcoin is a protocol. It is a set of rules for operating the network, it is not "about" anything. You can ask specific developers what their stance is on block size limits but opinions will vary. 
My actual point though was in regards to legitimacy. One way people think about a more legitimate Bitcoin is one that is more useful in daily life which necessarily includes being accepted by large companies. Large companies need heavy duty payment systems that are economical to use. If Bitcoin is too small for the money flow they need, they and their customers will lose too much due to slippage and won't transact at all. So a higher price means greater amounts of fiat value can flow via bitcoin which means larger companies can start to play.

XCP would only be required on the initial issuance of their token. So like 0.005 btc to issue a couple of sets of tokens. After that it's only Bitcoin fees that would need to be paid. This becomes important especially when issuing dividends. If they issue another dividend token they can send them to all holders with a single Bitcoin transaction. With Colored Coins my understanding is that a divided payment would always have to involve substantial mining fees proportional to the number of holders.

Actually only one OP_RETURN is allowed per transaction but you're right about encoding in the addresses. Counterparty uses 1-of-n outputs to encode its transaction data though it will switch to OP_RETURN when the main mining pools reliably mine transactions including them. Since people are paying fees to get these transactions in and in the end only the fees will matter, it's too bad OP_RETURN wasn't kept at its 80 byte proposed size(or even made bigger) to spare the utxo any unnecessary bloat.

Counterparty the protocol is a way to layer more complicated financial transactions on top of Bitcoin and other block chains.
As far as the proof-of-burn goes, if you don't have mining to distribute a currency, you have to figure out another way to initialize the balances of participants. This is the fairest way to do so, since people are spending something of value to create another thing. Whether that other thing is valued and by how much is ultimately up to the market to decide. If there is any criticism that could be made of XCP, it's that the burn period was too short. Then again, how long do people who will risk funds on a new project need to find such a project?
@_date: 2014-10-01 21:53:06
You could make the asset one that can be called back at some price in the future. Counterparty lets you do that though you'd have to be careful on the price you specify because it would function as a sort of ceiling on the trading value of the token.
Otherwise, I think you might be looking at this in a weird way. A company doesn't issue shares in order to maintain control. By issuing a share, they are transferring some control of their company in exchange for money (in the case of issuing stocks) or for the information the market can provide through price movements. It's a cost benefit thing...if they do it right, the value of the shares goes up and by extension the value of their entire enterprise. If done poorly it could hurt the brand as the value plummets. I would argue however that if the value plummets they have bigger issues and should take steps necessary to keep increasing the revenues, profits and value of their business.

Counterparty builds a database by watching transactions that are confirmed into the Bitcoin blockchain. Now if there were a catastrophic problem with Bitcoin, Counterparty could choose to watch a different blockchain from a certain block number and keep running on the most secure chain available. If a new chain were going to be made, it would have made the most sense to do that at the beginning of the project.

At some point it becomes about the users agreeing to follow a certain chain as well. If one could hard fork the Bitcoin blockchain with Scrypt and convince Litecoin miners to switch to the Scrypt Bitcoin. At that point you could say both chains are secure but without some major flaw in SHA256d, users/merchants would not switch and the question of security of the longest chain becomes secondary to a social choice for what is most secure now and in the future.

My point with this post is to ask the bigger question of what if anything warrants something like XCP to be created if we want lots of features but also stability out of Bitcoin.

While the AurumExchange aspect is really hard to fix, the problem of exchanges getting hacked can definitely be more effectively addressed. What I see is a lot of confidence placed in developers' ability to build secure systems. In my mind every withdrawal from any system that holds coins for others should have a human eyeball on it. 
If coins can be transferred out automatically based on only user input and code, it is a recipe for disaster. A safer policy like manual approval would seem to raise the cost of handling money but it actually doesn't. Either users pay for humans to be trustworthy or users pay in haircuts when systems get hacked.

Since research and analysis are Hard, for many of us, this means that before we run it the Bitcoin Core will need to release it.

That's the goal. Right now there are two jobs postings for python and wordpress theming. I have another I want to post personally but want to talk to a potential developer before fully defining the spec.
That one requires C++ experience and is to modify the addrindex patch to Bitcoin core so that it can run in pruned mode. This patched bitcoind would be used by Rein to supply unspent outputs during our automatic payment building process. Full draft spec here:

One could read rejection of BU and support for segwit as support also for a UASF. So the Canadian businesses and the numerous projects on that segwit preparation page, etc.

I won't call it a debate any more but it's amazing to think how much time and energy have been spent defending against this Classic/XT/BU front.
Can't change the past but going forward, I'd argue that a large fraction of that effort should be spent engaging developers and funding them for important Bitcoin infra.
It's not catchy. It doesn't get clicks. But if you're a hodler and can get over this idea that someone else will do it / pay for it, you can actually put Bitcoin to work really efficiently and power an awesome force of development.
If anyone's interested in the details of what's been done in Rein with a few BTC, I'm happy to expand.... The next logical step is to look at the results and try to extrapolate to your favorite project. Just imagine how much could have been built with all the funds that have been squandered.

Rein is a project I and a few others have been working on that solves this problem and does so according to cypherpunk principles. I've actually been using it for a few months to pay developers to help build it and the pace has really accelerated (check our github pulse). 
Some nice things about it are that every address, bid or posting is signed. Your identity is based on a mnemonic seed that you can keep in cold storage. And the architecture follows that of Internet hosting in general...meaning decentralized and Tor compatible.

If you are upset, you may be taking the instant transfer feature that was previously touted a bit too literally. Bitcoin transaction data goes across the network nearly instantly but that is more like an email than a system where transactions are increasingly set in stone over time. Within a year, I expect Lightning to be able to handle your use case better than Bitcoin even before blocks started to get full.
To the sabotage point, everyone is free to develop the Bitcoin software and Bitcoin's diverse set of users are able to choose which implementation they run. In this case, there is no sabotage unless the vast majority of users can be convinced to choose software that works against the "right" way.

You're right about how cool it is. It's actually somewhat magical using this app right now having seen how far it has come. As a client, I used to have to manually build transactions using Coinb.in and copy and paste addresses and private keys.
Now, once the work is done. I click Accept and the app grabs the utxos that it signed for the freelancer when they submitted the deliverables, then builds the transaction, and broadcasts it.
If you want to do that kind of work for BTC, you should check out the code or even join. We've had some commits to get the server going in docker and dev environment under vagrant but there's definitely more to do.

Thanks for the question. Hopefully I can answer succinctly but there's quite a bit to Rein and not a ton of documentation so I'll use this opportunity to answer and go from there...
Each rating is a signed statement from one user about an experience with another. The client downloads these ratings and validates their signatures as it does all messages on the platform. It then calculates the scores itself right now just using a simple average of all the ratings a user has received. 
We already have a pull request for a second level trust score that operates similarly to the Bitcoin OTC market's bot. The client will also not present the opportunity to rate someone unless you've completed a job with them as one of the other parties.
We definitely invite comments and improvements to this first shot at a reputation system but also realize that trust is a sort of nebulous concept that people figure out on their own using all available information. 
So perhaps we'll do keybase-style attestations to link Rein identities with others when desired. It also might be interesting to link to other explicit reputation systems. That's why we implemented the Identity protocol v1 by generating a Secure Identity Number for each user.
Rein's identity system is designed so there's a master key that you can keep in cold storage and the client will retain a BIP32 xprv that's a sub branch of a hardened key based on the master. This xprv is what is used to derive delegate addresses that are used now for daily signatures and payments. If you'd like more info on our key management check out  ... again something that we're looking for comment and review on.

Indeed it's on the roadmap. What we're thinking about is a client-side encrypted version that works something like blockchain.info's browser extension. 
Basically, you'd install the extension, then point it at 2+ servers to which it would sync an encrypted local database. Rein uses sqlite for now to store documents and keys locally so in theory that could be encypted then uploaded to each server you've registered with. All that would be required on the client for authentication is the SIN and delegate private key (possibly password protected). This would simplify the installation requirements and also serve as an automatic distributed backup of your identity, jobs, ratings, everything.
We're also working on mobile apps with iOS actually in process at the moment. Android would be started as well except we haven't found a dev. Know a good one?
One of my favorite things about Rein is that risk is way low. As the founder of the project, using Upwork or Freelancer I would have to carefully consider whether to start a job with a prospect since I might get screwed over by the dispute process, site policies, or payment problems.
With Rein, my only real concern is wasting calendar weeks not making progress. I know and trust the mediator I choose so if the jobs doesn't get done, I'm fairly sure I'll get the BTC back minus mediator and bitcoin network fees. 
The worker knowing this, is actually more likely to just come out and say they can't do it, and request to return the funds (this is what actually happened in the one job that didn't get completed so far).
Addresses are all defined and signed into the job documents so it's also quite clear for a mediator to see what happened with the blockchain as his aid.
BTW, I think you put in some bug reports so thanks a ton for that!
@_date: 2016-01-12 02:00:08
Coinjoin can't hope to make payments untraceable. What it does is confuse address association techniques that assume one wallet controls all keys used to sign a transaction. For that purpose it's working somewhat. For untraceability we'll need CT or better.

We may have some overlap in needing some wallet features but not wanting to compromise privacy. I'm testing PR  to Core because I want to be able to get unspent outputs from one of a couple servers that are fairly lightweight nodes. For now the client will just ask servers by address but later I could see wanting to query a block of addresses to increase the anonymity set.
@_date: 2016-06-01 02:41:54
They're doing it wrong. Bitcoin is the most interesting part so it's supposed to be last in the segment. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 15:51:03
The key feature is that all addresses and keys are derived from a seed. So you only need to backup that seed in order to not lose funds. Other info like labeling or notes aren't included in the seed so you still may want to make other periodic backups for the Bitcoin app but at least the funds are safe. 
Practically speaking, whenever you start up a Bitcoin app and it asks you to write down a set of random words, it's BIP32 at least.

From what it sounds like you haven't taken any profits. I'd probably take some and hold the rest until the price doubles and take some more then.

This may be giving banks a little too much credit. They are aggressive about closing accounts and have been even before Bitcoin could have been seen as a credible threat to their oligopoly. Threats of fines for not doing enough on the AML front are where the closures started. Maybe now they see the threat and potential for their own coopted version of blockchain. In any case, it won't work. Bitcoin deserves to be a public utility as much as the Internet with the same allusion to it/both being a force of nature. Inevitable.

This is an unsolved problem especially when it comes to niche data. Micropayments show some promise but will really have to wait for lightning before they can be done in a decentralized way.
I've been thinking about this in the context of decentralized trade, specifically decentralized labor. OpenBazaar and Bitsquare each seem to be doing well at growing decentralized commerce and a hosting model may make sense. For now, nodes need to stay online even though the economic value of the data they're serving is definitely high enough to warrant payment.
For Rein, which is focused on decentralized labor, it's had a paid hosting model on the roadmap from the start. Our servers, which can be run by anyone, already implement payments using Bitcoin Core. By charging 0.001 btc for a year of hosting, they should have their costs covered by as little as a few paying users. The theory, which is unproven at this early stage, is that small payments to many servers (some anonymously run) can build an uncensorable network, whether that's decentralized or merely distributed-enough.
Check out r/Rein if you'd like to run a server or help develop the system. It's all python/flask/sqlite right now.

In the land of kickstarters this is only safe if there's an escrow that can judge hitting milestones. So, you could do this with a m-of-n multisig escrow with m (&gt; n / 2) trusted members of the community and some guidelines on when btc would be released to the funded as well as how and when it might be returned to funders.

@_date: 2017-01-21 23:58:08
I'm not looking for them to have a donation address, that actually causes issues. Instead I'd like to see people with Bitcoin who care about certain features, fund those features with simple multisig escrows, and award them to the best/lowest bidder.

I would encourage you to acquaint yourself with Rein because it makes it easier for you to manage such jobs with the addition of mediators so devs don't actually have to trust you, nor you them. All jobs are specified, contracts digitally signed and funds held in multisig escrow. 
It's pseudonymous and we're also looking to support multisig under lightning.

@_date: 2017-01-21 23:56:09
Focusing on your two issues and bear with me for rantiness here:
I. People are very reluctant to donate. - This is part of the reason for my jumping on this post. I don't imagine a whole bunch of people are going to be donating to anything so no harm done trying to redirect folks. In the past, I've donated to some things but there's zero lasting satisfaction from seeing your money just move from your wallet to some project's. Bitcoin being rife with scams makes it all the riskier to donate to anything. So...
Rather than general/slush funds, I propose the donors do go the bounty route and *don't* write off low amount bounties. My theory is that you actually get much more efficient with small bounties because of that tension between you just doing the coding yourself and spending the money. Even if the code requires clean-up, you have introduced another dev to your project and to Bitcoin and gotten that much closer to finding a great dev who might transition from paid to volunteer. You also get more engaged and efficient with what you as maintainer will focus on or get funding for.
The project should have a development roadmap so donors have a menu of things they could fund. If there are no results, the money can go back to them individually or parlayed into another attempt.
Bounties should be awarded to individual devs and held in multisig escrow with a mediator agreeable to both sides. This means larger jobs can be done safely which opens up more possibilities in terms of finding donors.
II. Finding people. - Obviously there's no silver bullet but there are millions of programmers on this planet and being paid in Bitcoin probably means something more now than it did even last year. I've basically had my eye out for a couple of months and have found 3-4 developers to help with Rein. I've been impressed overall with the value and will talk more about my experience soon.


While not specifically focused on this use case, Rein is designed to be a decentralized system for managing multisig escrows and has worked well for the few semi-small jobs I've initiated on Rein. From my experience, I know this can work and look forward to providing some data in the future.

Agreed. Who wants to fund and manage development of browser extensions for each? I can help you get the most bang for your buck using another app that arguably would also benefit from being browser based.
That being said I suspect you mean that these apps should be as simple to get started with as visiting a website. The issue there is that website becomes a central point of failure and how would you ever convince people that the risk is important when they can use the app anyway? No, like Bitcoin there need to be systems where the rules, data and key mechanics are something that are very hard to take from everyone.

Don't underestimate the power of this kind of freedom-nurturing software. Bitcoin potentially means people can't interfere with your money or speech. Rein means people can't interfere with whatever online work you might do. JoinMarket helps mitigate the privacy and fungibility issues in Bitcoin.
If people are looking for charities, your suggestions may be good. I haven't looked into their track records, governance, handling of funds. Open source software infrastructure is easier for many Bitcoin users to evaluate so my argument is that they can invest profitably in the same.

This is why I've been working on a decentralized freelance market for a year. The project is finally at the point where it's being used to [hire a few software engineers]( to work on the project itself. In process now are a transaction sign &amp; send, a BIP39/BIP32 based identity setup process, and a mobile app as well.
While it's been a ton of fun developing a decentralized freelancing tool, what's even better is seeing how an easy-to-use multisig escrow process can ensure neither myself, or the project, or the dev get screwed. It takes some of the pressure and uncertainty off doing business with this irreversible currency.
To think this idea through I wrote [this]( as I was finishing the command-line MVP and convinced myself that the labor for Bitcoin trade is ideal especially when building Bitcoin infra.
If you have a project you want to light a Bitcoin-fueled fire under, stop by  on freenode or here and tell us about it. Maybe we can help you get setup. A neat thing is that you could have a donor who really just cares about one feature and is willing fund work on that. Then you as project manager can ensure the work gets done before making payment. It's a neat model that may work even better when you're trying to build an efficient business. The website: [ReinProject.org](

It's less of a convention than before so if people don't know, 6 confirmations is what is necessary to defend against a miner with 10% of the hash rate being able to double spend you 0.1% of the time.

The fee market, like any market, operates efficiently when producers (miners) seek to maximize revenues and consumers (users, exchanges) try to minimize cost. 
Lightning stands to increase the marginal utility of each onchain transaction since each can be the start or end to an almost infinite number of offchain payments. If true, users will be willing to pay more fees on their anchor and closing transactions because that cost can be amortized over many, many instant offchain payments. 
At the beginning and in the absence of spam attacks, fees may not rise much until users start contending for block space to open or close their payment channels. Once that happens however we could see fees rise to 10's of dollars worth of bitcoin fully supported by the value each onchain supplies to users. At the same time, tons more users will be able to experience instant, trustless payments all while using Bitcoin.

Besides holding, the single best use of Bitcoin that fits the "what you can do for Bitcoin" idea is to pay developers to work on Bitcoin. I came to this conclusion a year ago, have since built a system to make this easier and safer, and am now using Bitcoin to pay a few devs to speed up and improve development on it. I hope to show in time, the tremendous value of this idea to encourage others to truly invest in Bitcoin using bitcoin. For more info check out the dev road map at r/Rein

As FreakJoe mentioned, this is the software that's been worked on   
The goal it so far is to look for novel ways to estimate fees and to do that you first have to collect some data on when a txn is first seen. For general Bitcoin analysis, you may find another package is better but if has to do with confirmation times and the mempool, this is a good start.
@_date: 2016-11-21 04:44:55


It works by creating a network of nodes which run Tor hidden services. When you run a node, you run a Tor hidden service that advertises your trades and conducts necessary operations to move a transaction along.


You send it to another user's bank account typically via ACH or SEPA.


The details vary but it's roughly the same as long as they're supported. I'm not sure which countries exactly are supported but I'm sure they have that on their site.


To deal with fraud, Bitsquare requires the buyer to put up a security desposit. If they don't send the fiat, they risk losing that. Some small set of mediators from Bitsquare serve as a final arbitrator though it's not clear if ever have had to step in.
The sellers funds are managed by the wallet in Bitsquare.
Finally, that the buyer sent the funds is verified by a process that cryptographically notarizes screenshots of SSL pages (specifically online banking sessions in this case).
Hope that helps. can correct me wherever I'm wrong. He's done a great job building and I believe promoting this but it's new and like Bitcoin takes more than a cursory glance to "get".

They aren't stored on a PC or network. They are placed in a 2-of-3 multisig escrow address. For funds to be released both parties have to be happy. This is why even the buyer must put forth a security deposit. If they don't pay, that amount will either be locked forever or maybe go to the seller, not sure which.
Edit: forgot about the third key

Gemini and other regulated exchanges should be applauded for erring on the side of security. If you think you're going to need your coins within 48 hours, they probably shouldn't be at an exchange.
@_date: 2016-11-21 07:16:22
People should only spend coins if they can increase the value of their remaining hodlings. This is most likely on open source software that makes Bitcoin easier to use, more efficient and effective at its two real killer apps: store-of-value and uncensorable commerce.
Rein is a sort of meta-project here as a decentralized protocol for getting this kind of work done. It's been a year in the making and is finally at a place where it can be used to bootstrap itself.
If anyone is interested to help fund its development and growth, this can be done anonymously with no other obligation than sending coins to certain multisig escrow addresses. Freelancers, surrogate clients, and mediators can do the rest.

That's interesting, the law seems to be fairly broad so i2p or other alternatives are also included. From what I've read/watched JM doesn't claim to protect identity against government-level observers so wouldn't that as a lowest common denominator mean that Tor is still useful in this context?

How about this? We create a list of shady stuff we want investigated. Then post each as a job on Rein. As bids come in from journalists we can see what the real cost would be to do an honest investigation. Then the job can offered to the best journalist and the community can fund the escrow from addresses they control. If the job doesn't get done the money is returned. If it is, the journalist gets paid.

Is this for crowdfunding or loans? What's the recourse if the funded party doesn't come through on their part of the deal.
It's probably better to use a multisig escrow with one or more trusted escrow agents as signers. They could then dole out funds as needed/proven for the one requesting funds. With the right setup, senders could even get their money back if the project falls through. By reducing this chance of scamming large amounts, crowdfunding could be much more efficient.

It's hard to know from one tx but I'm working on a tool to categorize transactions various ways and see trends. Maybe this kind of thing happens all the time, maybe only when the mempool is larger. Maybe all miners mine these sorts of underpaying transactions and maybe only some do.

You have pointed out an opportunity that LN creates but I'm not sure about the assertion that Blockstream is in a terribly privileged position to securely and reliably run hubs. That is a market in and of itself and will likely attract the world's best security and reliability engineers to that cause. I would bet Blockstream can't afford them all even with the $21m.

It is multisig but you do have a key to it. You would typically only use that key if you wanted to close the channel or there was some disagreement or unresponsive party to your channel. Each time you spend some of the funds it becomes possible only to reclaim the unspent funds that you had committed to the channel.

It seems the standard fee of 100 bits would still get the smallest payment transaction into a 1mb block. More than 200 bits should get that transaction into the next 750kb block.

Developer here. The graph shows how many kb worth of transactions are in our node's mempool at or below a specific fee rate. Toward the right you see not many kb paying a high fee rate.

I'm assuming the block size limit isn't increased since that seems to be where we are at least for several months. If people are willing to pay for value, my argument here would be that fees should rise to that value.

If you listen to him on  you'll understand that he's talking about the block size debate. His point if I understand it correctly is that increasing the block size limit is similar to subsidizing Bitcoin's use as a transactional network and is/was being carried out via software distribution channels that may undermine Bitcoin's more standard (BIP) process. 
He's not for raising the cap. He's just pointing out a slippery slope.

Let's say I'm a toaster and I'm in the process of toasting another batch. This is paid for by a series of micro transactions on lightning (think streamium) but since I'm connected to the Bitcoin p2p network I notice that my customer is attempting to broadcast an old commitment which would leave me toasting this batch for free. I instantly stop toasting and broadcast the refund transaction that gives me all the money that was put up for the channel. I am now proving to the world that nobody can make me toast things for free.
An absurd example, yes. But what if I weren't a toaster but a huge industrial machine or maybe just a meshnet router.

The protocol doesn't track individual coins. Instead it tracks outputs which may have a quantity of bitcoin specified in them. When you spend bitcoin, you're spending one or more of these outputs and creating one or more new ones.

Looks to me like a standard fee of 0.0001 for most transactions (works out to 0.4 mbtc) should still be fine for 750kb blocks.

If you look at the way LN uses the block chain as an anchor to be touched only when creating a new connection or to resolve a dispute, it becomes clearer that having tons of devices directly connected to the Bitcoin p2p network is valuable even if they rarely post transactions to the blockchain.

I also respect John because he demonstrates solid understanding of the technology. 
Most of us understand that Bitcoin is not ready for prime time. What we do is watch out for deal killers, and then are hopefully working to keep it a step ahead of anything that might damage the mission. 
His criticisms are fair but I see no deal killers, it's actually a great article for the staying a step ahead side. What we really need, and I've been working on [Rein](for this purpose, is a way to allow hodlers to fund a lot of the necessary work without having to woo VC or pay for all kinds of bureaucratic overhead. My question for the community is, out of his criticisms, which most deserve development funding? Have hodlers considered the fraction of their wealth or time that they would be willing to put toward any specific effort?
I think we may be on the cusp of an important shift in resource allocation for Bitcoin and would love to help organize a decentralized development effort to show the naysayers just what is possible. 
@_date: 2016-02-19 21:21:08
Brave does offer some hope but I think a fundamental issue is that browsers are not considered trusted environments. If you are going to have a browser sign for you, then one has to plan for compromise, which means using a key that can be revoked. The model I am working on in [Rein](is one where there is a master keypair that is your identity, then that is used to sign a delegate address. The delegate can then be used in a less secure environment. Once that signature of the delegate includes a timestamp of some sort (a Bitcoin block hash), it can be ordered in time and revocation honored.
I am interested to hear more about having your identity in escrow and how you see that working.

Online store and plug-ins for them have their uses but I'm not sure handling private keys is one of them. 
Reputation will have to come into it somehow and sybils should be expected. Just not building anything like that myself as it's not so critical when a) the job creator chooses the mediator, b) I'll probably be the only job creator for a while and c) the product isn't terribly fungible. 
I've been looking for such a website to hire programmers but I see handling fiat as a weakness that they tend to succumb to. I'm done building websites so a protocol (free software) it is.

It's at an alpha stage but the brave/developer types can use it now. I have a job posted on the platform so if anyone knows Python and Tor, I encourage enrolling and submitting a reasonable bid.
There is also a test mode that is supported by the servers but it is only in master, not in the tagged alpha.

Since we're pulling numbers from the sky, I figure more than 25% are oblivious in any way that matters. 
@_date: 2016-02-22 20:43:11
The system is designed to be uncensorable and introduces this redundant, paid microhosting server model to achieve that. Once we have 10+ servers running with half of them over Tor, I think your litmus test is passed.
For the escrow question, if the mediator disappears the job creator and worker would be the only ones left to sign the 2-of-3 that holds the primary payment. Guess they'd have to come to sort of agreement. Nobody here can run with the funds unless there is some reputation-risking collusion.

Decentralization and servers are not an impossible mix. Those servers just need a reason to be. With [Rein](I'm experimenting with a concept like web hosting as it currently works. In this case though, there is very little data/bandwidth required so hosting can be cheap and at least according to the vision, purchased redundantly for those who will obtain value from using the system. I'm thinking like $0.25 worth for a year x 10 servers. For the cost of a coffee, you're off to do your decentralized uncensorable work.
Upwork and others charge 8% or much more which is a significant amount of a $1B+ market that can go to not just paying the microhosting servers but also mediators.
My point is, I'd like to see this microhosting server thing work and it looks like DZ could use this model as well, which will probably make more sense as/if fees start to prohibit the direct blockchain stuff.
@_date: 2016-02-17 07:42:42
Of course use Bitcoin. I am familiar with the question.
But there are a lot of ways to reduce the hassle of putting together multisig addresses or finding those who would like to work for bitcoin. I've been trying out various platforms and found that escrow providers are either custodial or don't pay out in Bitcoin. Say you want to have a feature coded for DZ and you're willing to pay for the work but want a pure Bitcoin option and your privacy. What do you do?
@_date: 2016-02-02 01:29:48

@_date: 2016-02-16 20:03:25
To expand, most transfers require just one signature but Bitcoin supports requiring multiple signatures to spend certain designated funds. To protect yourself from being scammed, you can send the money to a multisig address that is made just for your transaction where yourself, the seller, and a mediator each have a key. This reduces fraud because you would only sign if you got the item and the mediator should only sign if in their best judgement, you got the item.
More complicated anti-fraud scenarios are possible where two or a majority of a group of mediators must sign to release funds. The simpler 2-of-3 case is used by decentralized markets like [OpenBazaar](and [Rein]((with Rein adding a mandatory multisig where the mediator must sign, to pay him/herself).
@_date: 2016-02-18 16:25:42
I wouldn't say the only player. Maybe the only VC-backed player. Maybe for sales of physical items as well but [Rein Project](will definitely make a go at the service sector. Also supports pseudonymity and privacy enhancing technologies in the architecture. It's also running in mainnet mode. Just needs some mediators (anyone can join but pm with bids and I'll pay for approved mediators) before I personally post some programming jobs this way. 
Best of luck to the OB team. They are very helpfully shining a light on the commercial side of what can happen with Bitcoin.

@_date: 2016-02-17 07:11:55
Everything has a beginning, and right now, not a single transaction has happened using the software that I know of. That being said, I believe the decentralization will come from a network of paid servers that will arise to serve paying users. For users that want a more robust network they might pay a little more for servers hosted on Tor, I2P etc. 
I won't claim to have this figured out, just that I'm trying to do so. I've considered Kademlia, BitMessage and others but this is an easier starting point for someone who would prefer to spend bitcoin on further empowering it.

Citizen journalism is a great use case for multisig escrows.

The blockchain is much better for read than write. 
In regards to the small portion of the economy comment... One of the things that gives Bitcoin value is the number of people/agents/nodes globally that are viewing the blockchain. Like visitors on reddit, most probably will lurk, not transact so would not be counted in such a vote. Think of hardware that is watching for payment channels to close or for a signed message from the mothership. For this reason, I do not believe putting something like blocksize to a vote is good for the system.

This is a challenge facing any decentralized market. It seems the best way to combat fraud is by building reputation and at least to start, OB will provide cryptographic proof that an entity was engaged in a set of transactions. I think we'll see a lot of innovation in reputation scoring once networks like this see some volume and longer term use. Think pagerank.

That is a great idea. Sort of a standing credit that pays for a certain number of downloads. The challege there is in preventing "click-fraud". You pay per download, the seller gets wind of your link, and quickly uses up all the credits.

It's actually a very good question. It does seem at first glance that all this work is useless but of course it is not. What it does is set a bar on how much processing power would be required to attack Bitcoin. Your incentive to provide this protective processing power is a slice of the newly minted coins and transaction fees.

Nice work on this project. I am chiming in because export of private keys is in general not a good method of withdrawal. If you're concerned about fees eating up the money, internal/off-chain transactions are likely to be more effective. I understand you want to give people their first address but recommending a well done online wallet like blockchain.info is much better. Keep up the good work.

Your process is open to dispute by someone watching the network closely. What you might want to do is have people enter a refund address and upon receipt, they are given an address to send to.

The price is directly related to how many people are using and can use Bitcoin. Amazon can't begin to use Bitcoin for example until the market cap dwarfs the daily or monthly revenues they expect to transact in BTC.

Believe it or not, I would probably check out the available escrow services on Bitcointalk. There are a number of them with a long history and while most of them are custodial (meaning they'll just hold onto your BTC without multisig), some of them do multisig as well. Do your homework commensurate with the value of the transaction.

There are strong economic incentives to manufacture the appearance of such a split, therefore I assume it is manufactured.

The two main things you require are that each contributor have a bitcoin address that only they control and that they use that address to sign a pledge to use any coins at that address to fund the purchase. 
Generating an address is trivial but using it to sign a statement might be a very small amount of work. There is a python address generator at  that creates one address at a time on any computer that has python installed. Python is easy to install. 
It could probably be extended within a day to sign statements as well.
That would just leave funding those addresses as your users' biggest challenge. All doable. Good luck and let me know if you need help.

If you're willing to do a bit of work, you can probably make some estimates as far as trade volume vs. transaction outputs each day. I would hypothesize that non-exchange transactions are growing at a faster rate than exchange transactions but of course I haven't seen any evidence. One thing I've heard however is that every non-exchange business gets busier as the price goes up. People like to spend when they feel they're getting a good deal.

I agree that this design probably took the most time and effort to create but you're also looking at a version that was submitted after the contest was over.

CoinDL here. Great example by the way. As others have said, we do issue you a unique address for each purchase you'd like to make. The thing is, we still don't really know who you are. Contrast that with other payment systems where some form of identifying information is required and you'll see an obvious privacy benefit.
On First bits addresses, that's more of a novelty. If you're the first to receive a payment at an address with a particular string in its initial characters, you then incidentally have the first bits.

Moreso than your specific suggestions, kudos to you for recognizing that Bitcoin does have a press problem. Does it need to be actively solved or do we just need to keep building our economy?
The number one perception I see online from people who aren't familiar with it is that it's already dead. This comes primarily from the Google search they'll do and the word Fall in Wired's Nov 2011 article.

I think one issue with Twitter is that the vast majority of tweets go unread. The primary value is in social proof(got 10k+ followers? you must be somebody) So it actually may make more sense to pay for followers. The second best value of Twitter is searching for realtime news on things like natural disasters, elections, and tv shows but I'm not exactly sure how FeedzeBirds can take advantage of that except (and I don't personally want to see this) through some kind of keyword spam.

If you're talking about mining, you'll want to get a better video card e.g. HD5000 series or better. At current difficulties you'll get from 3-10 coins a month running the card 24x7. Bitcoin is much more than mining however. If you have any skills that could be of use to someone with some Bitcoins you could create a thread at bitcointalk.org or setup a site (even a blog). Bitcoin is money so think of it like that and it'll help you think of how you might try this thing out.

For a paper wallet that you want to use again and again, I would recommend you import the private key into a new [blockchain.info/wallet](My Wallet). In this case you can actually skip the paper wallet. A paper wallet is better suited to offline storage by advanced users.
Mt.Gox's import is meant to be a one-time deal. It's hard to say what might happen to coins sent to a redeemed address at a later time.

Here's my insight on the downvotes. URL shortener services are very easy to setup and since there are 100's (may be 1000's) of them it's hard for yours to make much of a contribution.

The foundation as it starts is led by people who are getting things done for Bitcoin which is good. My main suggestion would be to leave the large sponsor tiers' pricing off the site.

It's actually not. The hashing is like a big lottery that many people can play at the same time. The difficulty is set so that a winning number will be found once per ten minutes on average. Since it is basically luck, nobody can fake a bunch of wins. They must do the work and for non-governmental amounts of processing power they'd be better off mining and getting paid in btc rather than trying an attack. Mining, and the hashing done during it, make transactions more trustworthy more quickly.

Currently, putting in a static bitcoin address and qr code are the way to do it. If your app has network access and you're comfortable running a database, there's no reason it can't grab a bitcoin address from that database each time an address needs to be displayed.

Specifically when running bitcoind, you don't want to allow incoming connections if you are considering zero-confirmation transactions. This is because an incoming connection from a double-spender could carry a transaction from them that will purposefully not be confirmed in the blockchain (due to them spending the same funds to the rest of the network just a fraction of a second before). For more info:

Let's face it. Bitcoin is a huge sausage party and is far too focused on financial games. We do need to grow the economy and get women involved at the same time.

We have to ask ourselves what are the differences between Wikipedia and Wordpress that causes them to reach these two different decisions? I'll posit that it is the tax exempt status of a charity vs the fewer restrictions on commercial enterprise. The shame this essay brings is entertaining and thought provoking but we should look to do two things on our end. 
One is to find a way to address the anonymous contributor problem. The other is to focus efforts on other businesses like Wordpress that sell services internationally and stand to gain directly from access to the entire global market.

I've been looking at this for a little while and in case anyone else is considering giving it a shot: you'll need to get the full html of the reddit page(the rss feed doesn't have the iframe links), then pull the iframes returned by all the  urls, then get the embeds from inside those iframes and figure out a way to get all those accessible to your javascript code. Then hopefully you send play commands to each in order. Most sharing sites have an autoplay that could abused with some sort of iframe reload. 
I've managed to extract an iframe and display it on a page but haven't gone into it further than that. This is a really cool idea so hopefully someone gets it done. For the scripting code, I'd be doing perl.
Now that I think about it, greasemonkey or something client side is likely to be a whole lot easier to do and maintain.

You can turn bitcoins into USD at an exchange or by trading with someone locally. 
mh or Mhash is a measure of hashing speed of your Bitcoin mining hardware. By running that hardware for some period of time with a pool you'll obtain some number of BTC depending on difficulty and how long you mine for. You can then turn those BTC into USD as mentioned above which will give you an idea of what your Mhash applied for the time you spent mining will be worth in USD.
Check out blockchain.info's stats for some idea about mining profitability and here's a calculator to try out:

I wrote an eBook called You Can Learn Bitcoin (available at [Lulu]( and [CoinDL]( with just this focus of making Bitcoin easy to pick up. 
I do not use the word ledger anywhere in the ebook but the first time "block chain" is mentioned is in the context of running the reference client after the reader has done an actual transaction, used Instawallet and blockchain.info/wallet. My definition there is:
"In the lower right of the Bitcoin window you will see an indicator that shows how many connections your client has to the network and how far along it is in syncing up the block chain. The block chain is a database that contains every transaction needed to verify that your coins belong to you. At the time of writing, the block chain contains every transaction ever confirmed by the Bitcoin network and takes up a couple gigabytes of disk space. It is likely that this software will be updated to prune the block chain and save disk space."
I have used the public ledger term before in explaining Bitcoin and would do so in the future but I guess my main point is that Bitcoin is not simple to explain with a one-size-fits-all approach. Choose block chain, or public ledger, or history according to what you know about your student.

I wouldn't say it facilitates credit card theft but it does increase the reward for the scammer. Merchants don't give cash back on credit card transactions because of the fraud risk. So basically people keep thinking, "Nobody offers bitcoins for credit card? I must be a genius, so I'll do it!" Then they setup a system to do it and then realize over the following month or two that it was a horrible idea.
People keep trying to minimize the risk of chargeback with shipping evidence (on ebay) or sending as a gift (paypal) but the scammers have a lot less to lose. They're using throwaway accounts and cc numbers so it's a very lopsided arms race.
Edit: Also I don't get OP downvotes. It is a fair question and only slightly leading.

People can place links to any part of the CoinDL catalog on the sites they already own and have a referral code embedded in those links. That code causes a cookie to be placed in the visitor's browser and when they buy something later, part of the revenue goes to the affiliate. 
It's a pretty established way to grow traffic and exposure and what's nice here with CoinDL is that affiliates get paid in btc in a couple days.

These are bugs. All software has bugs and it takes time to work them out. One could argue that they should have been caught before release but fixing them is certainly doable. 
The biggest issues for the service are increasing the user base (thanks Kevin Rose) and finding some way to insure users' deposits. Both are helped greatly by having serious funding.

Turns out, to create a transaction just requires a private key. So you can attempt to spend coins without reviewing the blockchain. Whether it will be accepted by miners of course requires that the coins are there to be spent. BCCAPI is something that is used to query for such information so the entire blockchain need not be downloaded by a mobile client like, for example, BitcoinSpinner for Android.

Miners will generally tell you it's not worth it out of self-interest but mining is there for a reason. It remains a decent way to get some Bitcoin if you want to accumulate it over time. Know that you'll pay a premium in time, equipment and electricity for the independence of it.
@_date: 2012-06-23 17:51:47
So are you saying that finding another private key that yields the target address isn't sufficient? I thought of it like using vanitygen to generate an entire address as the starting point. Weaknesses in (as I just learned) ripe160 or sha256 might enable someone to speed up "vanitygen".

Understanding the wallet in your pocket doesn't help much when it comes to Bitcoin. You'll understand that you can put money in it and take it out but it doesn't help someone understand how an address (that they'll actually need to use to accept or send payment) maps onto the wallet concept. Metaphors are never perfect so there's only so good it can get but I guess as the author it's your job to choose the best one for the job.

I would say Bitcoin isn't very efficient at this stage based on daily miners revenue, number of transactions, and the value of those transactions.

@_date: 2012-06-22 05:06:53
Bitcoin operates on private/public key pairs. The public part of that keypair is what creates the addresses to which payments are sent.  The corresponding private key then allows you to spend BTC that were held by an address. The concern is that someone will be able to generate their own private key that will yield the same public key (or address) and therefore steal those coins.
For example, if I look at the blockchain and find an address that has 1M BTC, I could start trying to generate a keypair for which the public key matches exactly. Currently, this would take way too long (like age of the universe long) but if some weakness or set of weaknesses are found in the functions Bitcoin uses, and if 1M BTC was worth more than $6-7M USD, it might make sense to crack it.
This is all a long way off so I wouldn't worry about it. As soon as such weaknesses were found, Bitcoin could be upgraded to use even stronger crypto/hashing functions.

Two bitcoin sales is atrocious. I bet you could sell more if you setup a booth on a street corner.

For your type of business, as blasphemous as it sounds, you would probably do better to accept other forms of payment and give a Bitcoin rebate to encourage bitcoin usage. I do hope your cross-promotion efforts work out.. could be a very scalable way for each of us to help one another.

Blockchain.info is a good start but once you get beyond the amount you'd walk around with in cash, you'll want to setup a paper wallet.  is a minimal python utility you can use to generate addresses. You should then keep the private keys for those addresses offline, on a usb key or three, or print it on paper, etch it in stone, etc. Secure your coins in relation to their value and keep learning about it...there is no perfect system.

While confirmations are indeed faster in litecoin, anytime this fact is mentioned it should really come with a disclaimer. If the hardware and power costs supporting both networks were equal, one would need 4x the confirmations in litecoin to achieve the same double-spend protection.

The result of the hash function used by Bitcoin depends on its exact input. Since each block includes the winning hash of the previous block as input, changing an earlier block means you must recalculate a new hash for that and any following blocks. 
This mathematical linkage is what makes it a blockchain rather than just a bunch of random blocks of transactions.

In terms of development time they do have some skin in the game. There's also the potential of a good business that is at risk. It is a natural fit for them to use m-of-n transactions so I hope they will offer that for higher value jobs in the future.

From what I can tell, it appears to be following a similar course as Bitcoin in terms of value vs. # of transactions when adjusted for the 4x of coins that will exist in the network. The quicker confirmations make no sense to me since it's fundamentally a question of value transferred vs the cost of hashpower required to pull off a double-spend.
Some of the GPUs made obsolete by FPGA and ASIC will look for other mining tasks before being sold. I also like at least from an adoption standpoint that a vast number of people can casually mine with something they already own (a GPU) vs. one they have little other use for (FPGA/ASIC). Litecoin has better long-term prospects for that sort of widespread casual mining.

Everyone's missing your actual question. When you start your client its not mining you're doing but catching up with the blockchain by downloading all the new blocks. This will take a while depending on how long it's been since you last ran the program. My advice is to use a mobile client and load it with a small amount. From bitcoin spinner or blockchains.info android app it only takes a few seconds to sign a new transaction.

Whether one says tom-ay-to or tom-ah-to has everything to do with their previous experience (i.e. where they grew up and who they learned from).

I'm a little surprised nobody addressed your example questions so here goes. Solving a block requires iterating through segments or shares of the nonce number space. Finding a share means that you've searched a segment and you haven't solved the block, and yet you can prove that you searched the segment. 
If you solved a block then you actually found a winning nonce. If you only found a share then, since the process is a chance event, you simply improved the chances of your mining pool solving the block. 
Alternate blockchains can be formed as simply as creating a new genesis block and recompiling the Bitcoin source code to build on that block. Or more preferably you can try to change some rules that you believe would create a better blockchains or one that addresses another application (like voting or domain name resolution). Either way your altchain will exist on its own, linked to Bitcoin only by having come from a common source code ancestor.

We are running a standard 0.10.2 Bitcoin Core node with no filtering of any kind. I guess it depends on how well connected each services nodes are and how long they've been running.

Personally, I like cost per transaction. You can see a graph here: 
The "All time" graph isn't coming up for me but before the 2011 bubble, cost-per-transaction was around $3-5. When the price fell back down to $2, cost-per-transaction again bottomed out at about $2.5. Now, with the vastly increased number of transactions of SatoshiDice and other sites, this number has come down below $2. 
My theory: Globally including all miners and users, we are only willing to sustain a certain cost to carry out these transactions. With scale cost-per transaction must come down but transactions are why the Bitcoin network exists so that's how I fundamentally value Bitcoin.
If there's a true bubble, you're sure to see cost-per-transaction tripling or more as transaction volume won't grow as feverishly as price. It went up to $15/txn at the height of the 2011 bubble.

The other thing to note is that a complete cutoff is probably infeasible to do in a way that would cause more than a few hours worth of delay.

If computing power follows Moore's law, longer public keys will be fine. Lattice-based cryptography or another post-quantum computing algorithm would need to be implemented if QC becomes a reality.

A wallet has no formal definition in the Bitcoin network while an address does. Many bitcoin clients allow you to spend from a wallet (any number of keypairs) but I think the simplest, strongest understanding comes from the address. You can see it, check its balance, and if you're using instawallet or a mobile client with just one address you can spend from it. Once an address is understood, a wallet  is easy to see as a collection of addresses. I suppose part of what you want to address, no pun intended, is what new folks are likely to meet and struggle with first: a wallet or an address.

It's a good point that mining can prove daunting for new users but if they generate a small amount and have a way to value it beyond the fiat equivalent they have some "skin in the game". Either way it's good to have this backed up a bit.

While this doesn't mention Bitcoin, the following section is relevant to Bitcoin's growth: 
"Tybejee suggests several ways to entice consumers to embrace m-wallets, including making targeted offers as part of the mobile wallet experience based on a consumer's prior purchasing history; tying in mobile wallets with loyalty cards and programs; and allowing consumers to use them as a kind of e-ticket to enter stadiums, arenas and other venues."
@_date: 2012-03-15 18:53:06
Actually this is not true. Receiving addresses are separate and their balances are tracked by the network separately staying where they were received until they are spent 
When a spending transaction is created any change will be directed back to another address in the wallet and this can be called a form of slushing but it isn't as if the coins belong to many addresses simultaneously. 
To test this idea, you could use a tool like pywallet to extract all the keys of a wallet, delete one of the keys from the dumped file and import the remaining keys to a new wallet, this new wallet would show the original balance minus the amount assigned to the removed key/address.

If you're buying in order to buy a product or service, you're best bet is to hold off until you actually need to send the BTC. That way you are protected from exchange rate risk. On the other end, the merchant is wise to convert back into a more stable curerncy as soon as possible. The parties to a transaction can speculate in Bitcoin by buying early or selling later respectively but it's not hard to separate speculation from commerce as I described above.

Looking back at the birth of the US Dollar it may be instructive to realize that it solved a problem when it was introduced. At that time there were numerous state currencies that had each built trust in their states. To ease commerce in the Union (and since there was a Federal government this would not end like the Euro now) the US dollar was created. The trust each had for their state currency carried over to the US dollar which historically can be seen as quite a success.
Maybe we should encourage more crypto-currencies created to serve different regions, online communities, and more. If merged mining could scale to more than just namecoin and bitcoin and if those altchains weren't seen as some sort of attack on Bitcoin, this could be the thing that sidesteps Bitcoin's perception problem, the early-adopter concern, and gets people used to doing Bitcoin protocol transactions.

Part of mitigation is calling it out when we see it. The more people are aware that spam is used as a way to drive up fees, the less sympathy they'll have for the miners and the greater and more credible the thread of PoW change.
This becomes malfeasance when miners don't mine these high fee transactions on purpose so we should highlight that behavior because there's no other way to describe it than as an attack on Bitcoin users.

Part of the issue is that few people keep non-Bitcoin at the ready in an exchange. 
Keep some USD on MtGox so when you want to buy something it's ready to be changed into BTC. I've come to the conclusion that this is even better for Bitcoin than turning all your USD into into BTC the second it hits the exchange. Keeping a fiat balance means the exchange rate going up doesn't make you less likely to spend and the exchange rate going down doesn't decrease your purchasing power.

What is Network Hashrate? It is an estimate of the number of hashes being calculated by all computers on the network. It can't be directly measured. It is instead calculated from the difficulty and the average time to find a block over some amount of time in the recent past.
And how is it related to computation power? It's the same. 
Does that make the bitcoin network the largest (most powerful) distributed computer? Hashes are a very specific form of computation power so it's not really fair to compare against a general purpose supercomputer. But yes, it's the fastest ish on the Internizzle.

I understand the potential for FUD and I generally think that people should ignore anomalies. I take your point that one shouldn't jump to call it spam without some supporting evidence. In this case, I was online when it happened and saw an immediate complaint post show up here.
The reason I didn't think to look into how these transactions are composed was because 1) I've seen high fee transactions skipped by miners so genuinely worry about spam as a profit tactic. 2) It doesn't make sense to me that when someone would need to write code to put out this kind of volume, that the code wouldn't spread transaction release out over some hours.
Overall I seek understanding, to lessen impact of profit-driven spam, and to help users see through it if it doesn't have to affect them.

The oddest thing about this is that the spend amounts are so small relative to the total. A better security procedure would be to make bigger transfers of 1000 or 10000 btc to another address and spend from that. That way you can minimize the time the 440k address's privkey is accessible.

In order to create a transaction (i.e. spend Bitcoin) the program creating the transaction must be able to read the private key. If that program can read the private key this means malware, other programs on the system, or someone attacking you physically may be able to gain access to the private key. Minimizing the amount of time a private key is accessible is akin to only opening the bank vault when you need to pull out a week or months worth of assets.

Ok, different questions then. My advice here would be to be completely open with banks about what you're trying to do. The bank would then require the appropriate licensing and documentation to operate as a money transmitter but also as a currency exchanger. The difference that makes Bitcoin more attractive is that at no time does the transfer happen in someone's head or little notebook. All transfers of value from US to Somalia or back would take place over the Bitcoin network which many of us trust more than the word of an individual. On the other end, they make keep the BTC in their own wallets should that prove more useful than USD or SOS.

Thanks, all queries that had data in them have been updated to use query parameters. The code has been tested and released to production. We do have CSRF protection and the parametrized queries issue has been addressed as a priority.
I must disagree on the security confidence point. As much as the system and packages we use can be trusted, there is no doubt that at some time, an exploitable vulnerability will be found in one of them. When that time comes, the less any attacker knows, the better.
re: bounties, we'll look into what's appropriate in that regard.
Data is being collected now on the right amount to be airgapped. We're also interested in implementing scripts to require multiple keys to protect the coins in our "vault".

Got mine too. Great service from memorydealers. I was surprised that having the physical coin caused some new discussion among those I know that already knew about Bitcoin but hadn't done any transactions. Being able to see the balance on the blockexplorer is very cool. 
My only question is, can the coins/private key be accessed outside of redemption on MtGox? If so, the key doesn't seem long enough to import using a tool like pywallet.

That can work but for reliability you want multiple seed boxes and your client to verify as often as possible that they're doing what you're paying for. From what I've seen seed boxes are too expensive or need to offer smaller cheaper plans to trade the massive file hosting aspect for more servers that need to provide less storage.

I heard about Bitcoin first on /. back in the day but ignored it like so many others who are now kicking themselves. In May I checked back on Bitcoin used otc and Mt.Gox and, with all due respect to Mt.Gox, the decision to build and operate the first US exchange was clear.

Sorry, it's unfortunate that I didn't screencap that graph since it does seem to be down most of the time. That site estimates the cost of running the Bitcoin network by making certain assumptions about the cost of mining rigs and electricity. Then it divides that daily cost by the daily number of Bitcoin transactions. A transaction may be me sending BTC to you or it could be me sending BTC to many addresses at once. In any case, the cost is like $3 per transaction currently. We users of the Bitcoin network don't pay this cost directly but through inflation created by the 7200 BTC per day that are currently being created. I'll try to post that graph as soon as it comes up again.
@_date: 2011-11-02 21:27:23

Price does affect mining since higher prices will encourage more mining. If higher prices aren't accompanied by increased transaction rate then you could make the case that the world is paying too much for what the Bitcoin network is providing.
This graph is the most intriguing metric I've found since learning of days destroyed so it would be neat to see this metric gain more attention.

It builds a multisig escrow for each job and when the client posts the job, they have selected a mediator to hold the third key. 
It is the incumbent upon the freelancer to consider the reputation of the mediator and client before submitting a bid.

Your auction is denominated in $ which is a smart move when it comes to bidding. The issue I saw was that if you type too little USD in the box it says you must bid a minimum of "X.XX Bitcoins" which happens to be the minimum USD bid. Fear not though as it works properly.

I think you're right to an extent about hawalla doing an end run but if there's a large enough net flow, money must be transferred. Bitcoin could handle net flows here.
What remains to be seen in this sort of scenario is if BTC would pile up in Somalia somehow and make for an unfavorable BTC/SOS exchange rate. I suppose folks there would find a way to spend the BTC directly if that were the case but I'd be interested to hear if anyone else has thoughts on this.
@_date: 2011-09-08 21:17:50
Some thoughts/numbers:
* this graph should be labeled as cumulative. It would be nice to see a delta so we can see how many days are being destroyed per...um...day/block/whatever.
* It's been 978 days since the genesis block so if BTC are being mined at a steady rate, each BTC has an average age of 489 days.
* Finally 1.1 billion / 7.2 million means an average of 152 days have been destroyed per BTC.
Not sure what to conclude from these numbers but perhaps you other bitcoiners have a thought or two?

We sanitize our inputs and escape parameters passed to database queries.

No and please do recommend.




This seems dangerous to me. I understand the motivation but in the event of a shutdown, the priority would have to be allowing access to people's funds as soon as possible. Compromised accounts would be dealt with on a case by case basis.

The first part with all the 1s implies that the private key is not known. The second part was brute forced to make it a valid address. It's not vanity, it's a black hole.

A little about this project for those who don't like clicking on stuff. The idea is to create a way for people to work for and get work done using escrowed bitcoin as the payment method. The system uses ECDSA signing with Bitcoin addresses to establish identity and a publicly-verifiable record of each step in each transaction.
It's the basis for and compatible with pseudonymous reputation. The other thing about Rein that's a little different is the use of paid microhosting servers instead of a p2p network where there's little one can do beyond running nodes themselves to ensure the data they need to be available remains so.
This was started after hearing Trace Mayer talk about hiring bitcoin and a bit of thinking and writing around what really is the next step for Bitcoin beyond store of value.
In some places around the globe, people may not be able to make a living online or might be subject to economic censorship. Rein is an attempt to free labor from such restraints. Bitcoin does that for money and I'm quite convinced that [labor is the next step](
Also, here's a [little screen cap of the setup process]( If you have questions feel free to join  on freenode or post in r/Rein.

If you're talking about a BIP32 xpub key, that's not really necessary. Just a key that the user is confident they can secure for the term of their employment whether that's a GPG key or a Bitcoin ECDSA key. In order to use a Bitcoin signature, the public key needs to be available so the reuse factor is null in that context. Whether you trust ECDSA to last for the term of your employment or think you need GPG would be the deciding factor on which kind of key you'd use to sign payment addresses.
@_date: 2011-09-09 17:01:06
That's a good point. Perhaps only transactions under a certain amount of USD should be counted. This would require linking with the historical price but could give an idea of payments vs what you describe. Of course there has to be an assumption that nobody's buying large properties or funding large infrastructure projects with Bitcoin.

Decentralization is about anonymity in mining. If the authorities can interrupt your mining operation, then your operation is not part of Bitcoin's decentralized core.

One way to guard against the "I didn't get paid" fraud is to include a public key in the employment contract and require that  addresses that you pay are signed by that key.

Another way to look at this is as if Bitcoin were a different economy altogether.

It shares with each decentralization as a goal. Overall its probably more similar to OB in the open-endedness of what can be traded and ability to choose the mediator for each job. 
Unlike either, the model includes redundant paid hosting so you don't have to be online to have your jobs and latest info like bids and deliveriables be available. It's not a lot of data so cost can be almost negligible even for hosting across 5-10 servers. Think $5-10 per year total no matter how much business you do.

It's great to see this started up again as 2.0.
I got into this last year and the main issue with this type of system is that items in the world are not scarce enough. Over time, even emeralds (the rarest mineral in Minecraft) becomes worthless without some way to destroy them. Other games have done this by offering status symbols that cost a lot but can't be transferred or by having events/wars where large amounts of in-game value are destroyed.
Minecraft is fun and when I played the last version of Bitquest it was easy to come in with 1mBTC and be able to buy a lot of stuff but when I got there a lot of stuff was abandoned so it's also a matter of timing.
Will be interesting to follow. I'm really glad they're releasing code that others can use and iterate on.

I haven't seen it mentioned elsewhere in this discussion but if the central problem is exchange between fiat and Bitcoin, then the way to solve that is to avoid the exchange process completely. 
Work for Bitcoin and use those earnings to pay in Bitcoin. At the start you'll be earning Bitcoin that are hard to spend but you're helping to solve that problem as you participate. As a side effect you're increasing the value of Bitcoin by using it as a store of value for your productive output.

51% has nothing to do with segwit. 95, 80, 15 are all somewhat relevant but really it's looking like UASF and the 15% of current hashrate needed are all that matter. 
@_date: 2016-10-28 01:37:48
Segwit does two things that are important and probably some others. First is fixing malleability. That means there's effectively one id that is acceptable for a transaction that spends a specific set of coins to a specific set of addresses. This way we know what to look for to verify that a payment channel was opened. 
The second is it breaks up the way transaction data is stored in a block. Part of this data is discounted in the blocksize calculation so we get effectively bigger blocks.
I'm not sure if it's as a result of or just coincidence but we also get a way to signal for multiple protocol upgrades at once.

Users getting paid by Brave or some in-browser app is more likely to affect price than the ability of users to pay. Distribution is still a bigger problem really than ways to spend. This is why paying lots of people for small jobs is important and is why bitcoin freelancing is the focus of r/Rein

I don't think, and I'd like to be proven wrong, that Counterparty transactions are compatible with the HTLCs that are being implemented in lightning. With lightning, commitments can't be invalidated because the outputs that funded the commitments are now spent. Counterparty has no concept of a unique output so the same kind of commitment can't be made. Perhaps Counterparty will be heavily modified to add unique output tracking but since this conflicts with other properties of the protocol I bet it won't be. I've asked about this a few times in the Bitcointalk thread and on the xcp forums and got no answer so take that for what it's worth.

It says that those who agreed to it will support a hard fork to two mb blocks in a few months. I don't think the 2mb piece will happen though because tons of respected people did not sign that agreement and have no desire for such a blocksize increase, especially after segwit itself provides one. 
As for why so many miners have agreed, it makes sense because they are hoping to collude to keep fees high for users. 
Others who signed on probably realize that segwit doesn't require the 2mb part so they'll live with the part they like.

If you need to transact between now and say middle/end of August and you're not a miner who wishes to usurp control over the protocol, then setup a BIP148-enforcing full node (aka UASF node) and use that to transact.

Whoever says Litecoin or any coin is ASIC-proof is wrong. If you have enough money you can design an ASIC or specialized system to do anything better than whatever off-the-shelf solutions are available. What Scrypt does do however is increase the upfront cost of getting an efficiency gain. 
The economics are then tilted so it only makes sense to make an ASIC for Litecoin when the overall market cap is larger than what was required for Bitcoin. ASICs were first shipped for Bitcoin when the market cap was a mere $100m and Litecoin's current market cap is about $660m.

That's basically what Coinbase is doing. If you think about it, you pay your credit card bill with a check or ACH, but when you need speed on the order of seconds you use something proprietary. Zero confirmation transactions are close but buyer connectivity is an issue. 
So hopefully we'll have the best of both worlds. Coinbase-like entities that agree to process instant transactions between them (you'll notice BitPay is already honoring Coinbase's often delayed outgoing transactions) and later settle on the block chain of choice.

Bitcoin takes longer to find blocks by design. It's really more appropriate to say Litecoin takes less time but to focus only on confirmation time is misleading. What you want is aggregate hashes (in other words: work) piled on top of the transactions you're trying to trust. Security stems from the difficulty of an attacker to find n blocks faster than the honest nodes on the network. That's why you hear talk about 51% attacks. 51% is really shorthand for the attacker is finding consecutive blocks with high likelihood. 
In reality it can happen fairly often with 20% or 30% of the hashrate. If Litecoin offers anything it's that mining infrastructure is at this time far more distributed than with Bitcoin. A handful of ASIC mining entities control a staggering amount of Bitcoin's hashpower and that is worrying to me...even though I believe their strongest incentives are to make money, not to disrupt the network.

The exact efficiency improvement possible in a Litecoin ASIC is up for debate but it is unlikely that it's going to provide orders of magnitude increase as does the current fleet of Bitcoin ASIC devices. The bottleneck is memory bandwidth as well as die space. Scrypt was designed with a model of the cost of die space in mind and makes it so changes in hardware design involve tradeoffs.

In my experience price differences are caused by resistance to money flow. From this difference I'd expect that usd has a relatively hard time getting out of MtGox or BTC in (which I'd think is less likely). When the cross-exchange spread lessens we'll know that things have improved.

That's the best solution so far. When that becomes a problem it is assumed that transaction fees, block reward, and Bitcoin value will support the necessary infrastructure. If not, only higher value transactions that can pay higher fees will likely be able to process on the primary chain. Other chains could appear and be merge mined to support smaller transactions.
@_date: 2013-02-16 07:22:58
Right and the money they make comes from being able to sell the coins they mine, the price of which is supported by demand.
What I'm saying is the same incentives to mine will exist later as they do now. It'll shift more toward transaction fees as time goes by but in the end, profit will be the motive.

This not just a Bitcoin wallet. The key power here is in being a way to convert from bitcoins to Kenyan Shillings as used in Safaricom's M-Pesa network. So if I want to pay someone Ksh from the US, I can send them BTC and they can use that hopefully minutes later to buy coffee or pay rent or their utility bill or whatever. M-Pesa is extremely widely used in Kenya. There are not many places that DON'T accept M-Pesa there.

The implications of this are that you are unlikely to recover much of your 20 btc. It's up to each individual p2pool miner to decide to return their part of the fees. To help them, the best you can do is sign a message using the "sending" address with a new return address and post that message and signature far and wide. Good luck!

Litecoin did innovate in using a proof of work function that is difficult to parallelize. This means mining is likely to stay distributed amongst "the people" for far longer than Bitcoin. I don't see any one ASIC miner gaining a dangerous majority in Bitcoin but I like the idea that Litecoin will stay distributed longer.
The confusion provided by more options is totally understandable. A lot of people involved with Litecoin are obsessed with new coins of all flavors...but there are those of us who have truly tried to analyze how Litecoin got where it is now. It wasn't just lucky. It has survived a lot of attacks and a lot of work has been put into it. Especially recently as a ton of hashpower and people have joined in the quest to make it an asset to the cryptocoin community.
Litecoin provides a useful third channel for value transfer when Bitcoin and fiat are not ideal. The faster confirmations of Litecoin should actually help to stabilize the price of Bitcoin and Litecoin as people will be able to respond to market moves within 20 minutes rather than 1-2 hours.

Miners do not have to include any transactions but are encouraged to do so by the transaction fees that they could be gettting.
As for the age, it takes some time for the blocks to propogate across the network as they are verified by each node before relaying them on. In this case, the older block took longer to get to wherever blockchain.info's primary sensor node.

In the future, Bitcoin will be used more like a payment network.

You actually don't want a hash function that is slow on all hardware. That makes verifying blocks slower and can cause orphan chains to diverge more easily and for longer.

Transactions take zero to many inputs and create one or more outputs. When they include an input they cannot include just part of it. They need to include the whole thing. That way we can safely remove details about previous outputs once they are spent. It helps to save space in the blockchain for some kinds of nodes. 
Rather than encrypts you want to say signs. What they do is include the address (a hash of the recipients public key) with their public key and sign it all with their private key. That way the anyone can use the public key inside to validate the spend.
You can combine tons of previous outputs into a single new output though you might have to pay some fees since that transaction takes up kBs of data in the blockchain. If the miners don't like the fees vs. the size they can not include it. Eventually some miner probably will though.

The reason no block time is mentioned is because this is an example of Gambler's Ruin.

Rassah, I'd like to congratulate you on getting past your Bitcoin-only stance. I am also a long-time Bitcoiner and did some analysis last year on transaction volumes and price and saw that Litecoin was following a similar trajectory as Bitcoin.
I don't agree that Litecoin would become only a store of value long-term since I believe the faster confirmation times will win more users over time, but it has been useful to have another secure cryptocurrency to diversify into. LTC/USD tends to follow BTC/USD but rather loosely and in some cases, like when MtGox announced future support and with the massive onslaught of ex-bitcoin GPU miners, we have seen substantial increases.
Once MtGox implements Litecoin and as many developers have found, switching Bitcoin software to work with Litecoin is fairly trivial. It's going to be exciting once Tibanne Co. Ltd. make good on their announcement. Coinbase has said they will follow with support as well as Bitvegas(though not related to MtGox). Bitpay is more conservative but I fully expect them and many others to offer Litecoin within weeks to a few months of MtGox implementation.
You may also notice when these VCs talk, they mention "Bitcoin and things like it" or "math-based currencies". They have seen how tech evolves and are clearly leaving the door open for other cryptocurrencies, of which Litecoin is the most obvious to back.

One of the main difficulties of key protection is recognizing just when you are placing private data where others may have access.

Another is simply displaying such a code in a public place or where cameras may be present.

It's a purposely invalid address.
@_date: 2013-05-13 19:14:03
There are two parts to this. The most important thing is that you have a backup of your private keys. The client generates keys ahead of time and shows you new ones after each payment you get and uses a new one each time for a change address. I believe this key pool is 100 keys so you're probably well advised to backup every 5-10 transactions.
The other thing is for convenience, the wallet.dat records previous transactions so if you can backup after each transaction, you can avoid having to do a -rescan (which takes about 5-10 minutes) to make the client figure out all the transactions your private keys have been involved in.
@_date: 2013-12-17 19:35:34

I used to think it was scrypt but scrypt just allows it to exist in a world where ASIC is taking over Bitcoin mining. Now, I believe the primary merit of Litecoin is that confirmations come faster. This feels nice when you're trying to do trading but also means you are safer against double spends by attackers with minority hashpower more quickly than with Bitcoin. Basically the gambler's ruin process outlined in Satoshi's original paper comes into effect with number of blocks and has nothing to do with their speed or even the hashpower behind the network.

This would most likely be due to how folks find out about Litecoin initially. But it isn't true long term. What I'm seeing is quite a few people who are getting into Litecoin first because they hear about these cryptocurrencies and want to mine but all they have is a GPU. The wait for an ASIC is months to never so Litecoin it is. Since it all starts with the miners, I can guarantee you will have some businesses that accept LTC but not BTC. That being said, it will be best when support is wide for each. MtGox for example is expected to support Litecoin soon for trading and that will make it quite easy for BitPay and Coinbase to support it as well with their crypto to fiat conversion merchant processes.

You certainly shouldn't choose to send any funds to this address.

Your best strategy is to dollar cost average. Break up your investment into a number of chunks and invest one chunk each week or month until you've achieved your desired allocation.

It's actually not that simple. Litecoin targets blocks to be found every 2.5 minutes versus Bitcoin's 10. A convention that comes from Satoshi's original paper states that you can be reasonably sure coins you receive will remain yours (i.e. they haven't been double-spent) if you wait for 6 confirmations on the Bitcoin network. What confirmations really do is provide sort of checkpoints where you know about how many hashes have been piled on top of the transaction you're trying to trust.
So...Since it's really about the hashes, if an equal amount of processing power were hashing away on each network you would need the same amount of time on each, during which 4 times the number of blocks would be found in Litecoin than in Bitcoin. 6 x 4 = 24 confirmations. In reality, I think it's a little lower than 24 but someone better versed in probability might be able to shed more light on that.

Anyone who learns one of your addresses can link you to past and future transactions associated with that address and possibly others. It requires great care to use Bitcoin with anonymity, exchanges and governments aside.

Most altcoins are scrypt so AMD 7950s. I don't think you need to purchase a machine from anyone in particular but a tutorial like  should help you build a decent rig. Probably the most important thing for your profitability is going to be your electricity cost and don't forget to factor in heat management (i.e. cooling).
In regards to mining software that automatically switches coins based on profitability, it's really not a good thing for any network to fluctuate widely in hashrate. It leaves them vulnerable when they are not most profitable and a large amount of hashrate switching around can be used for nefarious purposes. Pick a coin or two to mine and stick with them.

That's pretty cool. This could be trickier but can you add something about the network's status itself? Number of nodes online? Forking? You'd probably have to poll individual nodes to make sure they're staying synchronized within a block or two.

I'm not sure of Litecoin's future but it has two things going for it. 1) ASICs are accelerating the slide in GPU-mining profitability for Bitcoin. 2) Those GPUs will still exist and the miners that own them have Litecoin staring them right in the face. 
Right now, I can switch my GPU to LTC and pull in 40% more. Who knows 2 days from now but that's where we are. 
Lastly, most of that Bitcoin infrastructure is fairly easy to port or patch to work for Litecoin.

Correct. That merkle root means that speed of hashing isn't dependent on how many transactions are in the block. It also means that the transaction's details such as inputs, outputs, and amount can be pruned out while the transaction hash can be used to prove that the transaction was included in the block.
@_date: 2013-03-08 09:44:00
It's possible that more transactions happen than current blocks can handle. There is a fee that a sender can add to their transaction to basically pay for priority.
The of transactions into blocks goes like this. People broadcast their transactions into the Bitcoin network. Miners and mining pools see those transactions and freely decide which ones they want to include in the block they're working on. The other transactions stay in what's called the memory pool. 
Once a miner finds a block, the transactions they included in that block are removed from the memory pool and the miners go on to try to find the next block. More transactions, more blocks storing them away, so on and so forth. It works.

The block frequency could be changed but this only means that you'd need more like 60 confirmations for the same level of transactional security. Faster block times also increase network hashing overhead since miners will spend a higher percentage of their time mining on not-the-latest-block.

Some people are getting ahead of themselves. If Bitcoin is to become widely used it won't happen anywhere near $100. In addition, since the market depth is roughly proportional to the price, you'll necessarily need a certain price for a certain sized business to be able to get in and out of Bitcoin without too much slippage(the penalty for buying coins then turning around and selling them). 
For example, right now you can probably put $20k-30k through the system end-to-end without paying more than 1% in slippage. That $20k-30k number goes up with the price.

Trust takes time to build and for some users never returns after a hack. The thing is bitcoin users value the immediacy of access to their funds as much the long term safety of their funds. IMHO, exchanges should process withdrawals only with manual supervision from systems not accessible *from* the webserver.

In regards to specialized mining hardware, Litecoin was created at a time when GPUs were making CPU mining for Bitcoin unprofitable. In some ways, this was a regression because though every computer has a CPU only some had good video cards and as more money was spent on GPU mining machines, it made the sea of CPUs obsolete for growing a mining base. Most recently Litecoin became a refuge for those GPUs made obsolete for Bitcoin mining by ASIC. Litecoin is in this way a secondary market for mining hardware. 
When Litecoin mining starts to produce more value, ASICs will be made and this will arguably be a good thing as the cost of attack will increase. It's just that those ASICs will not make the GPUs obsolete quite as fast because the jump in efficiency will not be as great as for sha256d.
What I see coming out of the choise of Scrypt is a level of stability in long-term mining calculations. Since ASICs won't be as disruptive, mining operations have less uncertainty and can, if the economics work out, grow their operations bigger with less risk.
Buying an ASIC for Bitcoin, while exciting, is quite risky. Lots of people are sitting on preorders that are or will soon be unprofitable to operate. There money that went to those preorders could have been used for other purposes and we'll probably never know the impact of that inadvertent trade-off.

If you assume the same hashing power is working on both hypothetical block chains, it definitely is true that 6 1-minute confirmations are easier to find than 6 10-minute confirmations. A block is not a block is not a block.

What do you mean by Scaling in bitcoin is going to be hard but might end up killing litecoin?
It's an oversimplification to say that since we have ASIC for Bitcoin it is automatically safe. There is not much stopping a government-level attacker from producing these ASIC and going to town. What we can say now is that fewer people control a higher proportion of Bitcoin hashpower than in Litecoin. Whether that will hold processing back or not is an open question. 
Either way the situation is evolving quickly and it's better to work together than to try to cut alternate systems down. Case in point:

Yeah expensive is the best I've heard. Still looking for some math though since I have moved part of my Bitcoin investment into litecoins. I've also heard that it would take more than a wafer's worth of such chips just as with Bitcoin to 51% the network.
Bitcoin is still not out of the woods with ASIC and I see it as more of an economic story for both. The market cap of the cryptocurrency needs to be a significant fraction or more of an attacking organizations available funds to be long-term immune.
I think Litecoin's key strength is now arising that ASIC is making GPU mining for Bitcoin less profitable. GPU miners can continue their craft and make a profit and folks who are new to cryptocurrency who want to just start mining as so many do can get their feet wet with Litecoin.

And to put these in further perspective, 0.1 on 23 or 24 is just 0.4% and your average price will be closer to the center. So one could theoretically transfer $15k from end to end for less than 1% in slippage. Also, this depth is a little light versus what we'll see after the price stabilizes for a week or two.

Starting a new coin is anything but easy. Litecoin is with us and has a strong hash rate because it uses Scrypt. If you try to make another sha256 or Scrypt coin or make one with a proof of work that competes for Litecoin or Bitcoin mining hardware it will most certainly fail. My point is, Litecoin's success doesn't mean creating new, successful coins is any more likely than it was a couple months ago.

1. The low hashes are found only once about every ten minutes on the network. The hash, along with the rest of the information in a block is broadcast to the network. In that block is a transaction that pays the miner the block reward. After 100 or 120 confirmations, those bitcoins can be spent.
2. While anyone can check that a transaction is valid, it is the miners who include them in blocks and lock them into history.

I didn't see it mentioned but the first thing a bank needs to do if they want to handle cryptocurrency is have a way to mark the source of funds in their fiat accounts. From cash or wire goes goes into the "hard" pile. Everything else goes in the soft money. Crypto can only be traded for the hard funds. Trading for the soft money invites fraud. Once this is out of the way, life can be pretty straightforward for the banker.

Before if you were a gov, you'd only have to make the few hundred asic units. From here a huge jump in hash/s/$ is not likely so it makes the offense and defense more symmetrical. That being said, I'm thinking of taking pre-orders for DNA-based hashing wetware.

Theymos has stated that passwords were hashed with many rounds of sha256 so they can indeed still be brute forced. It just takes that many more times as long to iterate through the possibilities. Thing is sha256 might be possible to brute force with some of this new fangled mining hardware so advancements in Bitcoin mining make this scheme weaker. The salting is an unknown factor but is worth figuring out if you're motivated. 
Bcrypt or another hash function is probably a better choice for long term security.
Use unique passwords with high entropy for each service and you'll be safe from database dumps like this is reported to be.

It is unclear if faster confirmation times are a real benefit for Litecoin. As a user they make it feel faster since a transaction usually has its first confirmation pretty quickly (if you're used to Bitcoin) . 
The real innovation, and the one I think the market is supporting with the $0.80 exchange rate and $12m market cap, is more predictable future earnings for miners. With no ASIC/FPGA to disrupt incremental competitive advantage gains, GPU miners are not only switching to Litecoin but are seeing fit to build new rigs. Payback times in such calcs need not be so short as 3-6 months if ASIC/FPGA resistance can be verified.

Actually it does. For attackers with minority hash power, double spending against Litecoin is harder at 8 confirmations than Bitcoin at 6. This is because each confirm increases double spend difficulty exponentially, regardless of how fast or slow the network's block finding rate is defined.

What you want to do here is keep the wasted hashing to a minimum which a seperate block chain that increases the average block time. Instead of 10 mins as we have for Bitcoin, we might go with 12.5 minutes * 100 which equals 21 hours in order to keep wasted hasing to 1%. A single confirmation would take quite a long time but if the hashrate was anything like that in Bitcoin, that would be more than enough for earthly amounts of money. Plus what's 1 or 2 days when it takes materials months or weeks to get there?

In the absence of easy ways to send fiat abroad to purchase bitcoins, people in Nigeria will need to either work for bitcoins or setup mining operations there.

I would argue then that hype can stop being hype when development accelerates in its own right.

Yes and an additional wrinkle in spending is that Alice provides the necessary public keys when she creates transactions. Before then her public keys would not have been known, just a hash of them. The additional security of the public key not being known for new addresses is why change should always be sent to a new address. 
In the real world example of the recent Android and Blockchain.info prng problems, there wouldn't have been any loss of funds if addresses weren't reused. Figuring out the private key would have gotten the attacker 0 btc.

The downvoting of an insightful post that expands people's understanding of the technology behind and around Bitcoin makes no sense to me. If you have an issue with the thesis, then post your concerns.
I can respect as well as anyone how hard we have all worked to protect and grow Bitcoin. I can also empathize the idea that some other currencies might be a threat to Bitcoin's existence and/or value. Perhaps we need to admit that there can be a dilemma, a reason to fight anything that is not Bitcoin, or not. The choice is ours. After all any other cryptocurrency that gains traction is likely to be a lot like Bitcoin: decentralized, of fixed quantity, and far better than anything the pre-Bitcoin world came up with.
