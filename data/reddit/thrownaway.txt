Auroracoin? That was just some random guy that released it, and barely anyone claimed it. No one cared. It was irrelevant over here in Iceland.

Didn't people say the exact same thing all the way from 1100 down to sub 300?

According to you, but luckily your opinion doesn't matter. 
There wasn't anything witty, clever or even remotely funny about your post.  
You do notice the downvotes, right? Usually funny or clever stuff doesn't end in the negative :/
Better luck next time, I guess? Live and learn :)

To each his own I guess. Although it's not perfect, no country is. It's not like people are starving or living on the street. 
Where do you live and is it much better? Iceland often rates quite high on quality of life indices. 


Are you referring to not taking up the euro? 
Purchasing power in foreign currency has increased by 45% over the past 2 years.

Not the ones that claimed "cheap coins" at anything above 750. Which people did.

Hm, some might say you're quite optimistic. Hell, people yell "cheap coins" in every dip.
 People did make the same claim when it went from $1k+ down to $800, all the way to sub 300. 
Either way, it goes way faster down than up. Which I can't say is good.

Well, it had some pros, and some cons I guess. It wasn't applied to goods or services mostly. It's been relaxed somewhat since then.


Well, it has improved quite a bit since the crash, the currency has recovered somewhat etc.

[Ahh,]( you're one of those "funny" guys minus any actual humor.
@_date: 2016-10-31 21:02:42
Hah, nope. Couldn't be further from being butthurt at all. 
Your post just wasn't funny, it wasn't *my* lack of humor.

Bitcoin had nothing to do with it either way. It was completely irrelevant. No one mentioned it in any party, the news articles posted here over the past few weeks were the first time I heard of any connection to Bitcoin. In reality it was like one pirate member, as far as I know, that mentioned bitcoin being a new technology on his blog a few months (years?) ago, just one sentence in a larger post and he's not a part of the party anymore. It was not a big part of the pirates funding or on any of their 'big' plans. It would never have been the main currency in iceland, even if they'd received the majority of votes.
