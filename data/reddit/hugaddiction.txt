Why do terrorists have to ruin the rights of drug dealers and people in poverty?

can you draw?  if so, please make this and repost
@_date: 2017-06-16 04:34:27
god damnit I hate terrorists and the people that use them to make my life harder.

excellent post, thanks a ton.  Its really  nice to find people on here that are willing to help a noob like myself try and wade through the exorbitant amount of information that is out there to find what is really useful.  you probably just saved me 20 hours of mindless searching with out a clue of what I was doing   
@_date: 2013-10-11 09:57:34
Its varying speed in MH.  It was at 20 something and is now at like 4 and getting slower, lol.  How do you maximize your MH and why is mine getting lower buy the minute?
@_date: 2013-10-11 11:27:34
I'll try 
@_date: 2013-02-23 22:59:46
thanks to anyone who gave me answers, why all the down votes? so hard to get karma these days, jeez
@_date: 2013-04-19 05:51:29
no fake names.  and I am verifying all of them, justa pain in the ass.  
@_date: 2013-10-11 10:23:50
its a box unit, not a little thumb drive, but yea, i think your right its, GH.  Ill check out bfgminer, thanks!
@_date: 2013-04-17 06:00:54
Im just curious if I have to verify to get my money out, why does that make me a scammer?  
@_date: 2013-01-30 22:37:56
yikes, didnt even think of it that way.  if we dont have paranoia we have nothing
@_date: 2013-02-01 08:11:14
Im going crazy hearing about some people already getting them, feel like im missing out!  Im going to feel like a kid on xmas when the thing finally gets here!
also, I joined a pool, Mtred, but am not really sure how it works, do I still need a pool once I get the hardware?
@_date: 2013-10-11 10:37:01
is it possible Im not giving it enough power?  like I should try a different outlet?  now I just sound crazy...
@_date: 2013-10-14 11:02:04
How do I find my URL for bfgminer?  I have an experienced miner meeting up with me this week to help me trouble shoot, if we cant get it figured out Ill come back to this post.  
@_date: 2013-04-17 05:09:17
why would you down vote this?  i seriously need some help
@_date: 2013-01-30 22:42:15
what alternative are you using?
@_date: 2013-02-05 13:37:02
freedom as an american, I deserve better
@_date: 2013-01-30 22:39:15
i have only done one transactoin with them so far, but was going to make an addiational deposit soo.  Do they require verification for withdrawls, or future deposits.  how much can i do if I dont verify?
@_date: 2013-01-26 08:37:25
how do you get actual physical BITS?!
@_date: 2013-04-14 02:23:07
actually, I was pretty floored when I saw it dip down to 54 and jump back around 100 the day after you posted this. You smart bastard, enjoy all your money
@_date: 2013-02-05 07:20:47
If you really are who you say you are shouldn't you be polling fellow workers, or economists, instead of the internet?  
@_date: 2013-10-11 10:34:18
When I unplug the unit when it isnt working and plug it back in, it starts running at 30GH, is that really supposed to be a fix all method even for miners?
@_date: 2013-10-11 10:35:58
it ran at 30 for a while and then just shut all the way off.  now its trying to reboot.  Normal?  or do I need to send this fucker back?!
@_date: 2013-02-24 01:48:43
lol, im not getting wrapped up in this crazy ponzi scheme any further than I already have!
@_date: 2013-01-31 12:10:33
what fees you paying? Im payinga  bout 5% with my current mode of transfer
@_date: 2013-04-12 10:40:17
said the college kid^^
@_date: 2013-03-22 10:52:13
no, but I will if they dont end up shipping me a unit
@_date: 2013-02-02 00:11:18
im mostly looking at it as a hobby right now, not an investment, though it will be nice when it pays for itself.  So, I joined the Mtred pool, gave them my address, do I have to do anything else?  does my bt miner know that Im part of that pool?
@_date: 2013-10-14 12:29:41
its my first time getting in to this so im pretty noobish, but I think this buddy of mine can fix it, unless my unit showed up with issues.  He runs 3x 120ghs and a bunch of lite coin miners, so if he cant fix it, its gotta be fucked.  lol
@_date: 2013-10-14 11:00:55
it is overheating.  so just flip the fan?  sounds easy enough
@_date: 2013-02-02 11:45:57
my wallet,bitcoin-qt .7.2, never asked for my Mtred info.  Is there a place to tell it what pool it belongs to?  I did however give Mtred my address.  Thanks for your help, Im a noob :)
@_date: 2013-03-22 10:51:56
i sure as shit hope they are, they owe me a rig.  nothing close to 30k though, so im not freaking out or anything.  
@_date: 2013-04-17 06:56:13
oh shit, thanks.  I emailed their account management team. I guess Ill see what happens.  thanks.  Also, I normally woulodnt try to get around somehting like this but had a time sensative purchase I was trying to make.  I guess I can count that out.  oh well, live and learn I guess,
