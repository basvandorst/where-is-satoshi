Just wait until the market realizes that litecoin is unvalued. I cant wait to score on that too 
@_date: 2018-01-06 03:45:28
LTC @ 280 yall. Crazy gains today...
@_date: 2018-01-06 02:07:33
LTC jumping like crazy! Almost 260 now
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:03:01
Because BTC is actually recognized and used in the real world for transactions. Everyone can create alts, and it's dangerous. If anything will crash it will be a majority of altcoins that do not have any transactional value. However, you are right in that it is not the right time to buy BTC. The coin is obviously going on a downward trend for the next couple of days--at least--so, we should probably wait until it is low enough to buy.
@_date: 2018-01-06 02:33:58
Update: Almost 270 per coin now!
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:25:11
Buyback at a high of 16300 in the short run, then drops to mid 15K. Then drop to maybe high 14K, then rise. Just going off at what the chart says. If things change then its another story.
@_date: 2018-01-06 02:46:37
Damn 273 already.... 280 let's go!
@_date: 2018-01-06 04:00:34
now 291.....
@_date: 2018-01-13 15:01:02
upward trend. Let's go!!
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:29:59
BTC literally drives everything. Look at where LTC was when BTC was at that the same amount and remember how LTC and ETH dripped when BTC dripped.
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:10:30
The 16.5K? This run does looks promising though
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:23:54
it's going back up!
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:17:41
Its a Chrismas miracle 
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:15:42
Bear signals are coming back. It probably won't shoot up until after New Years. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:27:20
go go go 
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:00:22
we are just getting started boys. It's going to be a bumpy ride down. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:28:43
I believe
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:53:41
Go bitcoin. 17K? before the whales 
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:04:24
All I wanted for Christmas is BTC 16+
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:01:04
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:15:37
Historical day
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:33:06
push push push 
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:03:56
damn it peteire 
@_date: 2018-03-26 22:33:33
I mean since it didn't drop below 7500 today and a pump says great things so far 
@_date: 2018-03-26 23:05:14
Damn I will pray for him
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:30:59
I know.. I am not sure how low it will drop but this is what I've been waiting for
@_date: 2018-03-26 22:43:24
I need money for rent come on baby 
@_date: 2018-03-27 21:15:21
screw it, all in
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:10:41
Big rebounds usually happen the day after, meaning today, or even 2 days after. Look at all the falls over $1000
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:18:35
Waiting for $6,500 break. This is going to be crazy...
@_date: 2018-03-26 23:12:57
Bull run
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:18:00
The $6,600 wall doesn't seem to hold up. Waiting for $6,500 break, this is going to be madness. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:56:22
Market usually rebound the after slump no worries
@_date: 2018-03-26 22:16:34
All in guys
@_date: 2018-04-14 20:23:16
Yeah, the trend is obviously up. There is no indication of drop. Maybe in the next week. So far this is a good and steady rise.  
@_date: 2018-04-12 21:41:46
we are the bulls. Horn up bro
@_date: 2018-04-16 01:08:18
Clean ascend so far. Let's test the 8500 and 9000 soon
@_date: 2018-04-14 20:20:05
it's consolidating. If it looks anything like what happened on Thursday, there may be a slight decline and then boom to 8,500 or just a straight shot there if we are lucky. I think everyone is just waiting for the right signal--the day candle and RSI show a turnaround at least for the next couple of days so today and tomorrow is risk-free. Pray to the coin gods you all. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 21:34:39
If this goes to 9000K by today, I will sacrifice my first born
@_date: 2018-04-13 19:41:44
lol bitcoin doesn't want to go down... 
@_date: 2018-04-15 00:06:17
lol I went and made food for like 2 mins. lol what. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 17:44:42
You are just a troll lol haha
@_date: 2018-04-16 13:47:48
Well, let's assume price reflects popular sentiment. Let us think about the other drops that occurred: Korea bans BTC and price drops. Mt.Gox hacked and price drop again. If you think about it, who really drives the price of BTC. The people. With a fair number of bulls and bears in the market, there is no reason for a drop to 4K. If, however, BTC crosses a certain point of no return then we can start worrying. As we have seen with the double bottom at 6.4K, no such bottom really exist so far. 
@_date: 2018-04-14 20:22:04
lol no. I will bet my Ferrari. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 21:38:41
Good, I am not trying to give up my kids anyways lol but it would be nice tho ahha
@_date: 2018-04-12 22:16:59
No way. In fact, I give that like a 1%. What data are you looking at lol. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 01:23:00
Can we get an Easter Miracle? May the coin gods take pity on us this Sunday 
@_date: 2018-04-13 19:51:34
Its been pretty solid the past few weekends. Saturdays were amazing. I am pretty sure it's about time to pump. The day chart looks amazing
@_date: 2018-04-14 15:10:04
the rocket show is coming!
@_date: 2018-04-16 14:00:34
I know look at the number of buy limits compared to sell limits. It looks good. 
@_date: 2018-04-14 01:48:35
cypto likes blood
@_date: 2018-04-16 13:49:01
Exactly, if the price really doesn't cross that line, we are still in a bull market. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 21:05:38
lol the market is just trying to deceive us in the short-term. Been through this way too many times now. It still scares the ball off of me tho. Feels like my soul is being chipped away 
@_date: 2018-04-14 20:43:27
yeah, it is crazy how many more buyers vs. sellers there are... Its been a while since I seen this. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 21:29:42
holy smokes...
@_date: 2018-04-12 20:45:19
It's almost time boys. Liftoff baby

Moon time
@_date: 2018-04-14 01:50:46
lambo, lambo, moon, moon, ra-ta-ta
@_date: 2018-04-16 13:24:39
I agree. The 4,500 sentiment is nonsense. The trigger event was due to a hack. Without the hack, why would BTC move down and lose 50% of its value? People have to realize that the market is cyclical, meaning even in bull markets, there is oscillation or back and forth movement. It is part of the game.    
@_date: 2018-04-16 03:38:56
BTC didn't cross the 15 min resistance, meaning the trend is not broken. I am guessing there is going to be a march up. If it did break resistance, I think BTC would have continued to drop until mid 7,500. I had my stop loss set at 8099 and the lowest sell was 8100. I can't believe how lucky I was... 
@_date: 2018-04-15 11:19:29
lets see if the pump continues to 8,700
