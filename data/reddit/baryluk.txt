Also from what I see they do not even store xpub/ypub permanently at all on their servers, and only use it on client side for deriving addresses. Android app, or Trezor bridge working on mobile would be even nicer. We will get there.
@_date: 2018-08-21 15:02:40
It is false. Ln requires blockchain.
@_date: 2018-05-25 15:13:15
No. All transactions to send any coins still require approval on the Trezor itself. The service will have access to xpub/your keys tho, so they will see all your transactions, past and future, of all added coins and wallets. The ones you do not add will not be visible to them ever.
@_date: 2018-05-25 15:28:49
It is stored in the blockchain on thousands of computers. They need to agree and accept any new coins and all transactions to be valid.
@_date: 2018-05-25 14:51:14
It is possible and likely that mandatory segwit for all transactions will happen in few years, once it is a status quo and more than 95% of new transactions are with segwit.

They will not stop immediately. They will most likely still mine, just not move coins out of their wallets, unless they believe the price will never recover or they are really short on money to run operations (electricity mainly).

BTW. The micro used in Trezor is an few years old embeded ARM cortex CPU, manufactures by STM. It is an off the shelf part, and I am certain that trezor made sure they are delivered securely and not tempered with during transport for example. Adding any spy functionality would most likely be detectable by power measurements too. And even if compromised, it would require some other things to go wrong (i.e. your computer infected with malware that can execute rouge code on the trezor and extract master keys out somehow). It is probably easier to steal the trezor, and try to extract keys physically from the device, which might be possible be some very well funded actors (but most likely impossible, and it would take time anyway. so on lose, assume the worse, and transfer all btc to a new wallet). 
@_date: 2017-02-08 09:17:33
I would suggest to follow the trezor website manuals. There are detailed and pretty clean instructions. After recovery in some tools, you should transfer all funds to another wallet anyway.

It looks like main use case for bitwage would be paying from US to people outside of US. This makes sense bitwage do have low currency exchange fees, and it doesn't matter where the recipient is. Big win considering huge fees for slow bank wire transfer from US to out of US.

There is no battery inside.
It should safely operate after 20 years of laying unconnected without issues. Preferably in dry and stable temperature. But it is sealed, so should resist wetness and corrosion of internal circuits. After that it might work, but who knows how reliable the programabmle rom / flash is, it might show some corruptions. It should be as reliable or even more than any other electronic device (I can still use 30 year old microcomputers without issues, but usually they do have mask rom, which is more reliable and essentially cannot be corrupted for 100 years).
Just follow first step of setting up trezor - create physical copy of revoery seed on PAPER and store in safe and secure location(s).
@_date: 2017-02-08 04:27:11
If you lost the recovery seed (doesn't matter if it was destroyed, or there is a risk that it was stolen or you just could not find it), you should transfer all the founds to a new (temporary ) wallet / address, wipe out the trezor, and create new recovery seed and wallet, do a paper copy of new recovery seed , and transfer found back.
It is impossible to get recovery seed again from the trezor after it is initialized. I think the recovery seed is not even stored on trezor after the master keys are generated from it on initialization, so it is not possible even in theory.
@_date: 2017-02-08 04:42:07
Only in theory, and with compromised or modified custom firmware. The mnemonics are stored in the flash, that is true (  , you can also verify the firmware code how it stores it in recovery.cc and storage.cc ), but trezor doesn't provide any API to get it out using screen after initial creation of recovery seed or recovery from another key. And obviously never over usb. You will need to have to compromise the firmware, upload special firmware (possible), or find a security hole in the usb protocol (i.e. buffer overflow) to execute arbitrary code, in which case you are screwed. the protocol decoding is done automatically, and is not handcoded, so it is unlikely to happen.
@_date: 2017-02-08 04:46:29
Any distro would be just fine.
@_date: 2017-02-08 04:03:25
Absolutely. You can even destroy the trezor, and your btc will still be fine. Its programmable memory for firmware and keys might degrade after a decade or two, but even that is unlikely. And actually doesn't matter.
You just need to write down the recovery seed on paper and store it safely and securely in two or three different physical locations (for example one at home, second in the bank, and another copy split into few parts each few words, given into less trusted place, like maybe your family members, with instructions in the will how to reassemble the recovery seed from some parts). That is not something you can skip. If you do not do that, and you loose trezor, it malfunctions in some way, you will loose all unspent coins.
There is no battery inside. It only operates when it is connected via USB to some other device.
From practical standpoint 100% safe. There are still things that can go wrong, your multiple paper copies of recovery seed are destroyed, one of them goes into hands of untrusted party, somebody somehow steals your pin and phasphrase and uses trezor just like you would use it, there is a serious security hole in one of the current or future firmware updates, or there is some serious weakness in wallet or bitcoin cryptograph or its implementation in trezor. In which case you are screwed anyway. So I would say, 99.999999999% safe if you follow proper precautions.

They probably are able to attack Linux too, but probably not a massive scale. They would have enough Windows machines under control to be a botnet or target most of the people. For the Linux, they would probably do that only on as-need basis with a lot of secretiveness. Also a lot of bugs is fixed quickly in Linux kernel and various libraries and products. But it doesn't need to be a Linux kernel bug, it might be in many other components, package manager, browser, anything that interacts with the network, your pdf reader, jpeg decoding library, or video codec, or image processing program, etc.
@_date: 2017-03-08 02:37:28
Yes. It looks like Chrome might not be using OCSP or even CRL, and instead is using own mechanism to do revocations based on data from Certificate Transparency project -  , this looks according to the post to be faster, and better for privacy of the user.
So, you shouldn't be getting these requests from the chrome on the phone as I under stand it. Maybe something else is doing it. I do not know.
@_date: 2017-02-08 04:46:12
The author of the website can steal your recovery seed, and use it (possibly months from now). There might also be some bugs in this website, which might unintentionally give access to the recovery seed to other parties.
@_date: 2017-03-08 02:53:59
Sure, you can make it secure and useless (not practical, - aka most hardware not working, most programs not working, etc - but you can do the same by disconnecting your normal OS from the network :D).
Making simple OS from scratch is not some black magic or voodoo, you can get create one in few weeks :) But then, even after years of development, the main security issues will not be in the kernel, but in applications and various libraries. It is not the fact that they are not created by you, it is just because they are complex, have a lot of legacy, and often were not written very well (and still are not).
@_date: 2017-03-08 01:53:52
Even if that is true (and most likely it is), I doubt this is related.
They do not need constant traffic to specific location to infect somebody. There is so many other ways to do that quicker.
@_date: 2017-03-08 02:07:52
Ok. That's true. But this traffic is normal traffic that is going to happen even if the browser is not infected with any malware i.e. ocsp.digicert.com is also on this network. If you are so sure, how about dissembling the code, or comparing manually build browser with the one provided, or verifying network behavior of different browsers. There is no substance yet in you speculations.
@_date: 2017-03-08 02:24:20
Please educate yourself maybe.

I was at one of the pools. I was contributing super low. It would take 3 years just to reach minimal payout, which was something like 15mBTC.
It is better to invest 1000$ in some modern miner and hook this up to a pool with segwit support signaling,.

This is edgecastcdn.net network, by Verizon / AOL. It hosts many different things over HTTP / HTTPS. Including ads but also various static files.
Also many sites provide OSCP for TLS certificates (most notably these provided by omniroot.com) on this CDN (i.e. ocsp.omniroot.com).
on my computer (in Europe):
    $ host ocsp.omniroot.com
    ocsp.omniroot.com is an alias for wac.BFDD.edgecastcdn.net.
    wac.BFDD.edgecastcdn.net is an alias for gpla1.wac.v2cdn.net.
    gpla1.wac.v2cdn.net has address 93.184.220.20
Nothing wrong with that.
    $ host 72.21.90.19
    19.90.21.72.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer edgecastcdn.net.
    whois

For example my browser contacts 93.184.219.34 from time to time 93.184.219.7 on https port.

    netname:        EDGECAST-NETBLK-03
These are also Verizon.
Only interesting thing I could find is this signature after connecting to the server:
    Server: ECDF (fcn/4036)
Sure, it is possible to fake all this data, but it would require cooperation with some organizations. Also, even if they are owned by untrusted party, it doesn't matter. These requests are done by the browser, and you can inspect source code what is done with it. Or enable some debugging (via flags probably) to show these connections in the log.

@_date: 2017-03-08 01:12:37
This is not how they did it. Creating OWN OS would not help you, it will only help in a way that it would be more obscure, and not of interest to them. But if they wish they can break it the same way. It is unlikely you can create full OS without creating a lot of holes in it.
Also, they can probably trigger payloads in network controllers and CPUs or harddrives, even without OS and main CPU noticing. It is harder, because it requires cooperation of hardware vendors. For Windows it is not super hard to find some exploit from time to time.
@_date: 2017-03-12 22:58:35
You cannot use full nodes count, it is too easy to cheat the number.
The proof of work function must be changed to allow more people to mine instead, without putting cpu and gpu at huge disadvantage against asic (current and future). I.e. cuckoo hashing based system. It is better than scrypt, because it requires a lot of random memory accesses to create a proof, but very little to verify it.
@_date: 2017-03-08 02:34:19
Hmm. I cannot find setting for that in Chrome or on Chrome on Android. I think actually Google decided to remove OCSP online checking from Chrome because it was slow and if request failed, it was problematic to decide if to allow or deny access. So I guess there should be no uses for it.
Edge is still using online OCSP checks tho. Maybe in some advanced settings somewhere.

There are cases where liquid is better than ln. Liquidity for big transactions, audit trail, confidential transactions and new assets.
@_date: 2018-10-12 09:09:33
Only exchanges can send or receive liquid assets. You will never interact directly with liquid sidechain as a customer.
@_date: 2018-10-12 08:51:15
Right now? Not many. It is good to familiarize with technology, maybe do some instant (smallish, &lt;&lt;100$) transactions, find bugs, be amazed how well it already works, or maybe try to integrate it into your business, etc. Beyond that mostly negatives: not many places to do transactions, low liquidity of a network, if you want act as forwarder, you will probably not earn money from fees (too low fees, not enough transactions), as it costs more money to run a dedicated server, but if you run some computer already 24/7 you can try just for fun.
@_date: 2017-01-04 21:51:38

Impressive professional, correct and easy to understand answers.
@_date: 2018-10-12 09:46:53
Are you an exchange or big market player? If not then you wouldn't use it , in fact you can't use it as a normal person. It is a closed sidechain.
LN has drawbacks, one of them liquidity , another less privacy that liquid, and most importantly - it is not ready for use.
@_date: 2018-10-12 09:06:42
So in theory we could gather bunch of other types of organizations and lunch a clone of Liquid Network with available code and a bit of extra engineering and preparation? It would be a separate network, with possibly some other principal parameters or use case. Not sure what it would really be useful for, and how to ensure users trust, but it should be possible.
@_date: 2018-10-12 09:08:18
Different use cases. LN will always have some issues with liquidity, especially for larger transactions.

@_date: 2018-10-25 15:03:01
Just today I have seen this twice. The transactions do have some embedded data and address the coins are coming from have human readable prefix leading to a bitcoin mixer website (which will remain nameless). So, it is just a marketing tricky, not real attack, but they probably do target everybody doing &gt;0.5BTC transactions today.
@_date: 2018-10-15 03:46:05
Hmm. Why in demos the payment dialog looks super similar to BitPay payment dialogs? Is this some standard? You are cloning look? Or you have some relation to BitPay? Curious.

Do you have docker images (with bitcoind and lnd bundled maybe?) and tutorials maybe? It would be great!
@_date: 2018-06-22 21:37:17
1. Almost no limits. Can do probably billions transactions per second network wide.
2. The network is not very liquid. Unless you want to transact with some nodes very frequently (I.e. every day or more ) and open dedicated channles, you will be limited to about 50mBTC in single transactions most of the time. Often less. 
3. It is not possible, unless all nodes volunrqrly reveal all information, and they still can lie. That is beauty LN. It is very private actually.
@_date: 2018-06-23 13:45:06
It looks like good comprehensive book on Bitcoin , and how it works. But I would say it is almost useless for developers. There is no code examples of using apis using external apps talking to Bitcoin core, no examples like how to build something useful like exchange, or merchant store, or integration with third party systems, or mining pool. Also a lot of topics should have much more references, to publications, wikipedia or core code and bips.
It is very good as an introduction tho, for advanced users and people who want to explore things in the future.

Most people do not know how to secure their   os. Prepackaged and easy to install and update apps on Linux distros probably account for 90% of security benefits. Most Linux distros (99% of them), still lacks proper isolation between apps of the same user for example. (Ignoring Android here obviously).
@_date: 2018-03-01 02:00:53
Human are main factors in security of any system. The fact that people so not stupid shit like downloading random programs from network, because most of them are in repos (easy to install, uninstall, update, and have them trusted), is responsible for 90% of the Linux being more secure than Windows fact.
@_date: 2018-03-01 01:47:41
People that use Linux are usually a bit more intelligent than Windows users (due to naive people giving it up after any blocking issue). And they do not download shity random programs out from untrusted pages. (And there is less shity programs to download in the first place, most of what you need it included in distro, so there is no point downloading web browser, file manager, archive manager, PDF viewer, video players , music players, codecs, graphic editors, text editors, system utilities, etc, etc - it is all in repos , easy and safe to install).

i do not agree with that. I have 3 nodes. One of them in the cloud (vps provider in Netherlands). But it is not in any big cloud provider like aws or gce, so it is fine, as long there is diversity. Having node in aws or gce is not good idea, unless you can find location / datacenter that is close yo you and have no nodes there yet. More than two is less desirable tho, as that would make it too centralized.

Depends on a feature size. Something maute like 65nm is cheapish to design and manufacture. 100 million transistors (medium size) design, which is repetitive, would be few months of design by two maybe three people (so let's say 100k$), then  photolithography masks production about 25k for few layers. Then after that probably 10$ per chip + fixed costs. If you want small run, you could fit in 250k$ design and manufacturing cost. For advanced nodes below 32nm it will be upwards of 2millions, due to design complexity, mask cost, a d design and simulation tools.
