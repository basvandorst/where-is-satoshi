Try all of them, 0-9, a-z and A-Z. That's only 62 combinations if you know it's only one character missing and you know it's position. Generate an address from each private key and check if there's anything in it.

One missing letter would be very easy to guess.

I sold it to a friend so didn't use any external websites. Also didn't have to wait around for the transaction to confirm since I trust him, although I did get the first confirmation within a couple of minutes.
