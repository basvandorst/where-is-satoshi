Did you came to save us from the machines?
No I came to sell BTC at 20k

Interests to short bitcoin at 46% a year on bitfinex. positions already taken so priced in, could there be a bull run any minute now? 
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:15:08
Jesus, did you short it at 11354 or did you lock the price! The market doesn’t move an inch
@_date: 2018-01-24 23:14:07
You can timelock your bitcoin for a year!

bitfinex to gdax premium is down from 400 to 70, is the tether scare calming down for now? Any updates?
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:05:45
hope so
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:53:11
Most orders of gdax como from coinbase, that has gigantic buy sell spreads, not a good platform to trade, it has been a huge entry gate for new investors but that has dried up since the ATH. maybe that explains it a bit
@_date: 2018-01-26 19:45:47
that is why there are always extremely low or extremely high orders in almost all order books
@_date: 2018-01-27 00:13:34
yeah, until the strategy stops working (you sell and it shoots up, or you buy and it crashes down), of course you might have made enough profits to make up for the breaking of the channel but it is a matter of chance that your strategy happened to coincide with the market behavior. Anyway, good for you
@_date: 2018-01-27 23:56:25
market makers, if they pull back their buy orders a small sell makes the price drop sharply, if they keep feeding sell orders to a price point that is being bought the price does not move even with large buys
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:08:13
back to entry, now against the tide... 
GDAX seems to be leading this mini run, squeezed the spread to bitfinex under 300

that 10.000k buying wall battle an hour ago was epic

bitcoin ticker (for ios don’t know about android) is excellent, you can set the alarms you want with different sound, with +- % or just price points. The best is that you can choose for a specific exchange (if you have money in an exchange it is nice to get the alarms for that specific one). It has a lot of alt coins if you are interested. The notification goes up with just a couple of seconds after the fact, I have checked
edit: its free if you don’t care for some extra functionalities not related to the alarms, and the ads. 
It has cured my price checking obsession, get that one or an equivalent

The worst recovery yet from the 10k battle, but maybe it will shoot up if the bears give up fighting from sub 10k, seems bulls and bears are rather tired right now

I have the same app, it makes automatic backups in the apple cloud, have you checked it?

HitBTC has batched my withdrawals, more than 100 txs

is that a new altcoin?

The private key is a 256bit number, it can be encoded in several formats, don’t know that one, if it is not encrypted (in that case you would need a password) it is just a question of researching and finding out
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:46:25
You need a segwit address, but for now the main reason you should want to move your bitcoins to a segwit address is to pay less fees when you move them out of that address in the future
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:26:32
the network is full, the cost has increased and outpriced your transactions fee, it will be processed once the feee price drops 
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:31:38
a private key is a 256 bit number (256 1’s and 0’s) that can be in several formats. The hexadecimal one has 64 characters but one usually uses wallet import format (WIF). 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:21:32
you are right, the diference is when you will pay tax, in that example you have to pay 1,5k after the first sell. Another thing is loss deduction, if instead of going to 20k you sell at 12,5k you pay 0.75k in b) but you will pay 1,5k in a) and get a tax loss deductible of 0,75k that you may or not be able to use

great move (at least for now)

Put half the money of the pineapple fund to trade in usd-bitcoin, would create revenue to fund charitable causes in the long run and would contribute to reduce bitcoin volatility, having huge amounts of usd to buy dips and sell bitcoin after fast price increases.

If you want fancy paper wallet with design and QR code I don’t know any trustworthy ones. But you can create a segwit wallet in electrum and export the addresses and keys, print to paper, then erase the wallet (you can do that offline and even format your pc after to be safe). You can use individual address and key pair or/and the seed to restore the wallet.

I think there will be further increase in the block size, it is needed to support massive adoption of 2nd layer solutions, the core developers just didn’t want a rushed hard fork to just do a block size increase, it has to be made with at least a year’s notice and if a hard fork is absolutely necessary it may as well solve other issues that can only be solved with a hard fork

BCH going to crash very soon, got my bcash from coinbase today, they are not allowing to sell yet, I tranfered them to hitbit and sold at a fabulous price (thank you bcash pumpers) but many less informed people are only going to sell trough coinbase 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:18:02
introducing but not allowing BCH sells is absurd, wouldn’t want any BCH in my hands when they allow people to sell it

Hold all, sell 20% Christmas next year
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:32:04
thats it, hodl doesn’t mean hold forever or sell everything once you get to a target. It primarily means not shorting with yourself because you know you want bitcoin and will have to buy it back
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:35:30
All or nothing also. Don’t have more money to buy dips. bought at several price levels, the first 400usd the last 9600usd, for know comfortably sitting in profits but will hold regardless

the words usually come from a 2048 word list, get the list (google it) and see if you have any word that isn’t there. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:46:43
don’t use that, don’t you want a segwit address? that site only has legacy addresses, its not up to date. Use a wallet to create a seed and segwit addresses, you can generate they offline and print the address/key pair, just not the fancy design, unless you make it yourself
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:41:58
download a wallet, one that gives you control of your keys is ideal, electrum for example bit there are many others. Create a wallet offline, take note of the seed, print (cable printer not wifi) an address or a couple of addresses (and the private keys if you don’t want to depend only in the seed), print 2 or 3 copies for backup, then erase the wallet. turn back the internet, you can format your pc ( use an old laptop) before you turn the internet back in if you want 100% safety, but for that amount maybe it is not worth the trouble. Then you transfer the funds to those addresses and you can monitor them importing only the public keys to any online or mobile wallet. your seed/private keys will be on paper.

it is not likely to go before the difficulty retargetting in a day or so, the fees will go up then, more so it bcash makes its traditional attack
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:29:25
if you don’t want to spend money (it costs a good % of your BTC investment) and if you plan to hold long term (don’t need to make frequent transactions) you could just generate an offline wallet and transfer the funds there
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:13:00
I had 20% of my bitcoin on an exchange (to trade a little with alts), send it to cold address yesterday to avoid thinking about something like that. Ps: transaction still on the meme poll ��

Official bear market, judging from 2013 its going down to 4k and take a year to recover. history does not repeat itself but it seams likely, probably wont fall as much and probably will enter another bull market faster. Maybe best to sell and buy more a few months from now, the risk is selling and get caught in a bull trap and buying higher even if it falls further. If you bought very low I would say don’t bother trading, if not maybe you should consider protecting yourself, or at least try to. Maybe sell half if you are over exposed and bought more than you should. I sold mine because its a lot of money for me, I will remain focused to buy again in the future. Sorry all
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:23:04
if not profitable lose even more?
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:52:24
if you sold in january 2014 and bought december 2014 you would have 3 times your amount of bitcoin no? (disclaimer: sold today to buy later, cheaper or with a failed hodler premium)

@_date: 2018-02-01 23:56:46
1k? dont think so, the comparable bear market of 2013/4 would put this ones low at 3 or 4k, these are higher values but the 2013 rise was even more parabolic so i dont think it will see 3k.
As for 20k sure, maybe in a few months, maybe only in 2019 or 2020
