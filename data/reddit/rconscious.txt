What is going on here?! Investor money? Starting to be a bit concerned about shorting...
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:45:22
B-but.... America is the center of attention for everything and is the bestest at everything Andie more important than everyone else!!!
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:47:35
THE LORD HAS SPOKENNNNNNN
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:47:47
I agree. I love that it’s going up, but if it does so too quickly, it will crash much much harder because we will have too many newer noobs who will all panic sell at the first sign of an even slightly significant dip.
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:19:33
Just 6 dollars away cmonnnnnnn
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:33:56
14k by the end of day!?
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:07:13
oh snap, 12k tonight?!
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:52:17
On it's way back already. Wish I had money to buy have bought at 10.6
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:23:31
12K ON COINBASE!!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:52:26
I know, right!? I’m glad it deflated a bit. It went up too fast. Would make the ride unsustainable and a crash would have probably been more severe.
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:38:42
Very true. I have a screenshot at 9999.99 the first time haha
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:13:51
Already at 17350.66!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:12:16
What makes you think that? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:37:28
Damn the whales and the noobs. Wouldn't be so volatile if it weren't for them. Still HODLing though.
EDIT: Back above 11k again.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:14:29
While your manhood might not be physically 4 inches longer, im sure it probably is mentally!
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:58:49
Yea but it tanked to 16k
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:11:50
and back up to 10.9
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:12:25
Who cares about this guy? As if Putin doesn’t have the election rigged already. This poor dude is probably going to “disappear” at some point.
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:59:19
looks like you were right! Now we are in the 11650-11800ish range.
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:34:19
Went to bed at 12.2k and woke up at 12860.01!! Crazy!
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:33:16
K ouch
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:15:18
It's never really official until it hits the milestone on GDAX
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:11:38
Definitely going to pay my taxes. Hoping to go on for "long-term" so it's only 15%.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:34:51
This probably explains the price uptick this morning.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:40:57
Hold On for Dear Life.
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:35:21
So glad my bank didn’t block me. Or at least didn’t block me when I made deposits back when I bought in.
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:49:55
His book will explode in popularity as his talks will as bitcoin picks up steam. I wish him the best. He deserves it.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:19:50
I was about to ask when this is getting started
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:58:53
  
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:57:35
HOLY FUCK WE BLEW PAST 14K!!!
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:25:42
Everyone take a deep breath. We're doing great if you zoom out. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:05:24
Aaaand it’s not doing anything
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:55:01
Literally had to suppress my excitement when I checked my phone mid class to find that we crossed 13k and even made it to about 13350ish. This is amazing.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:08:26
Now's your chance... again!
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:02:29
Also, can we get this pinned to the top of the sub? Or at least upvoted exponentially? I think the community needs to see this.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:00:15
I feel so much better about the CME Futures now. If Andreas Antonopolous isn't worried and he even indicates that we are going to see a ton of volume, I think HODLers are in a good position.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:48:06
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:48:59
He had an 80% approval rating BECAUSE the election is rigged.
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:55:43
I care
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:25:31
Sound reasoning. You’re right. I noticed some of what you described as well. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:31:30
wow it's making its way up! 12,123.71 at the moment
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:46:24
And again. And again. And again lol
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:22:55
Sadly, I think I have seen posts on here about peoples’ credit unions barring them from making transfers to bitcoin exchanges. I suppose you can point my post toward traditional banking in general.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:24:54
I’m the grand scheme of things, that doesn’t seem like a lot. Imagine how much the price will shoot up when we get institutional investors finally putting skin in the game.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:07:58
You’re up like $850! That must be nice. Until it dips
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:29:11
I believe CME is only allowing 20% profit from shorting. This is to minimize market manipulation from what I hear.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:26:52
Anyone know about BitFlyer? They we supposed to have started an exchange here in the US. I think they’re the largest in Japan? Maybe they’d be a great alternative to Coinbase/Gdax
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:37:08
Crash to under 17k lol. I wish this would be the correction but I think I’m just dreaming.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:17:54
prob 20k in 2 hrs at this rate lol
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:29:37
oof &gt;_&lt;
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:46:07
Came here thinking you were giving away free bitcoin! Leaving here very disappointed haha ☹️��
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:56:18
How do you know?
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:40:50
How do I turn it into real bitcoin :(
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:07:15
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:01:36
Damnn can someone send ME $1,000,000 in bitcoin ��?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:29:37
Holy balls. I thought everything finally calmed down.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:14:51
Where are the HODL memes when we need them
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:13:03
No but I wish I did lol
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:55:17
This is a good thing. A bit of relief for Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:25:48
Who is this person who I totally want as my best friend for no real reason whatsoever?
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:14:36
Truth my good sir
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:19:27
Wow, so I was excited to wake up to how much higher the price has reached but WAS skeptical that we could hit 12k today. Now, I'm feeling as though it could actually happen!
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:28:03
This actually might make some sense considering many of these guys are occurring while the USA is asleep.
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:23:43
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:30:37
Jesus Christ. Who is this individual who gave him 37 btc and how to I become friends with them? ����
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:20:09
God damn it just stay over 11k already lol
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:51:56
Actually they already do! Asia has 60% of the bitcoin in existence if I remember correctly.
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:46:04
Prob cuz it’s super new. Didn’t realize they started up yet. I’ll def take a look at them though. I’m glad there are more exchanges now!
@_date: 2018-10-16 01:01:00
I wish this article was referring to me, as I really wish I had $194M worth of any currency
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:44:58
8730!!! To the moon!!!
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:00:11
11,260!!!! Wow! To the moon!
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:30:02
Wow. I went to bed and it’s up almost another thousand! 10940!
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:43:00
What makes you so sure that it will be March 2018?
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:38:28
I understand your point and agree that the stock market is overbought, which is why I feel like they should equally be referring the stock market as a bubble as much as they do bitcoin. I get that much of it has to do with growth without a catalyst, but part of me thinks there are smart people out there who are learning how the technology works and realizing that it will be even more utilized in the future.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:26:31
10k on Coinbase!!!! Finally!!!!
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:36:18
This will be all over the news tomorrow. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:49:10
$500 mil? CME and now Overstock. Good stuff.
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:15:06
Seriously. Just replied one a similar posting, but this thing keeps flirting with 8k. Wish it would just cross over and stabilize over 8k.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:26:04
Holy schnitzel
@_date: 2017-11-25 12:34:32
I agree with you! However, I think that breaking these psychological barriers helps us get there though. It’s been hovering at about 8200ish the last few days so I’m glad it finally started climbing again.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:57:00
AAAaaaaand we're back over 10k. Sweet correction. Hope you all bought in close to the bottom if not at!
@_date: 2017-11-03 01:55:18
What an incredibly informative video. Stomping out fraud in wall street is yet another reason to invest in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:15:51
Hence this post being posted approximately 4hrs ago ��
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:57:55
I did just now and it looks the same
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:46:45
Quickly! Post your HODL memes!
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:39:10
I like the way you think haha
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:06:33
Odd looking Tesla you got there friend 
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:35:14
A big 4 firm? Holy. Balls.
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:08:06
7945! 
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:36:14
I will be so happy when 1k bumps are hum drum:
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:48:04
yea i saw it hit 8700ish. might have been the bottom but you could be right.
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:40:58
Wow you’re so lucky to be tipped in bitcoin! I would literally cry tears of joy if someone did that to me.
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:53:58
Lol redditor for A DAY. Take your fud and shove it.
@_date: 2017-11-25 12:55:38
Just saw it myself at 8640! What an awesome thing to wake up to ��
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:23:47
Let’s go ahead and add that a big dip will entice rich wallstreeters like to buy large amounts of btc, like Novogratz did this past round
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:43:59
Same reason why society thinks a Rembrandt painting is worth millions?
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:54:00
It already hit 11k. It’s pretty under right now but it will prob head back up above by the end of the day.
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:13:52
I know, right? It's been flirting with 8k for the better part of the day. Waiting for my Coinbase price alert update
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:39:53
Panic sells indeed. Now under 9k.
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:52:24
Was literally just thinking this. I wonder if we can get to it tonight. I went to bed last night with it around 8500 and woke up to it over 9000. I’m guessing bitcoiners in Asia are going to help us get there! I saw an article yesterday about how a major financial specialist expects bitcoin to hit 14k by the end of dec.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:49:23
If it's over, then yes you're right.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:34:01
Ladies and gentlemen (prob mostly gentlemen though let's be honest), unleash your memes! WE HAVE BREACHED 10K!!!!
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:43:17
I saw an article on Fortune that was posted a couple hours ago and I find this laughable. I went to bed and woke up with Bitcoin still hovering in the same price range (8230-8250). They are claiming that BTC and ETH tanked again. Ridiculous. Andreas was right. The more people try to attack Bitcoin, the more immune to this bullshit it becomes. A drop of 5 percent is nothing. It recovered quickly. Wish I was awake at the time so I could have bought more. Tether has nothing to do with anything aside from itself. No regular person has even heard of it and no one cares. Thanks for proving the strength and resilience of Bitcoin once again.
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:06:29
Bit of a noob on this bitcoin stuff. If it is that easy to get to 400k, do you think going from 400k to 4mil would be easy too?
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:03:27
Thank you for doing the homework to go and look at posting histories. It’s sad to see how skeezy people are. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:14:53
Just saw a "dip" from about 11350 to 10500. And it didn't feel scary! Too bad Coinbase and GDAX are struggling... really wanted to buy the dip &gt;_&lt;
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:34:33
Yup it seems to be the case. Already back up above 11k
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:59:15
This is what I’ve been noticing. Our Asian friends in bitcoin aren’t afraid of the drops.
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:35:52
How does one "short" bitcoin? Like i know how it works with stocks but how do you do it with BTC?
@_date: 2017-11-23 03:17:07
So lucky. Wish i had the foresight to buy in back in '08. But then again, im sure everyone else feels that way too haha 
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:51:11
If Bitcoin made my fabulously wealthy, I would do what I could to support Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:05:05
Agreed. Also, Indian people (particularly the educated and wealthy) tend to be super intelligent. If they're investing, then you know Bitcoin is a good investment.
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:11:31
Can I just say that stuff like this makes me love reddit and you all
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:21:17
Added legitimacy to Bitcoin. To the moon, my friends!
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:50:05
Literally me like 7 times yesterday 
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:15:22
True, my friend. Very true.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:16:08
Yup, Forbes, Bloomberg, Reuters, etc. All of them are like ERMAGERD BITCOIN LOOSES 1/5 OF ITS VALUUUUUEEEE
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:39:22
Back in the 8K range.
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:09:44
The exactly laptop I had in college lol
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:39:42
Damn it i wanna buy this dip!
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:33:44
Oh lord of bitcoin predictions, when you do think 1 BTC = $1Mil?
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:10:26
I’ve not been invested for that long. Check in again with me in 3 Years and I may feel as you do.
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:03:18
Just hit 7272 in coinbase
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:50:11
Aaaaand it's back over.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:48:45
Noob fear is real. The first major drop I experienced, I almost cashed out at a loss. Glad I HODLed.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:53:17
Aaaaaand its up above 9k again. Looking at 9800+.
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:59:07
What was the rationale for this weekend dip, if you don't mind me asking? Was it concerns that it was getting too high or something?
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:47:15
Yea I saw it cross 7800!
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:00:56
Wow dude how incredibly generous of you! So amazing to see there are good people in this world. I’d prob cry tears of joy if a family member or anyone else from that matter just gave me bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:48:45
That’s cool, more for us lol
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:43:29
How does one get tipped in bitcoin exactly? I’ve seen someone talk about it before but I don’t see a feature on Reddit settings.
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:18:47
How can I do my part and report this app? Been trying to find a way but it seems that I’d be required to download it first.
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:02:26
HODL, my friend. HODL.
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:37:59
Still waiting to see it myself :/. Wondering if maybe it retracted a bit? Still really awesome though! Im sure we will cross and move past 8k soon.
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:49:17
I’m seeing it over 7500!!!! 7553 is the highest I saw this morning.
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:56:42
This happened to me at one point too. I wanted to cry tears of joy lol
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:48:52
Woof. Gotta Buy 5 of these minimum. That’s too bad.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:38:23
Well here we go. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:04:36
Ah ok that makes sense.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:32:42
Hell, it's 10,052 now! TO THE MOON!!!!
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:42:12
I wish they spent time talking about how Bcash is driven by criminals for the sole purpose of profit and trying to wreck bitcoin, whereas Bitcoin has a dev team with that has integrity and is trying to advance the purposeful and noble mission of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:40:21
Wait what? The post was deleted?
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:13:33
Space suits tend to be really expensive though! you could get some more money for bitcoin off that!
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:51:55
Still waiting ��
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:33:03
Not quite there yet. We were so close. It pulled back a bit, but i'm confident it will hit 8k soon enough.
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:24:16
I genuinely LOLed at this. Nice post.
@_date: 2017-11-23 03:17:45
sshhhhh everyone else doesn't need to know that!
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:41:56
Thanks for letting me know. A guy could dream, right ¯\_(ツ)_/¯?
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:31:44
 it dropped from 11350ish to 10600ish. that's a bit of a dip haha. Hopefully, that's the worst of it!
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:41:39
Ok cool thank you. I googled it but wanted to make sure this was considered trustworthy.
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:04:46
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-07-17 21:53:56
I, a person who is currently in Asia, did indeed wake up and was like ‘WTF’.
@_date: 2018-07-27 22:56:37
I saw one of these once. It was ‘Eluon Musk’ who was giving away btc and eth 
@_date: 2018-07-19 12:40:51
I’d totally work for it! I just dunno how to get there.
@_date: 2018-07-19 05:50:30
I wish he’d invest $17M in me. And by that, I really just mean I wish he’d give me $17M for no reason at all.
