I sold at 255 and then set it to buy at 245 before I went to bed.
Let's see what the rest of the week  yields. I wanted to buy stuff with my appreciated bitcoins, but now I can't buy the stuff I want.

This sounds like my kind of game!
I'm in!

Whoa! Thanks for the heads up!

I'm keeping the printout in a hidden safe. 
How can I reduce my "failure points" to 1?

I think what he meant was that Apple rarely shifts technological paradigms.
The last paradigm shift they created was the multi-point touch screen. But even then, it was in consumer technology. I've seen functioning multi-point touch tech before the iPhone was released. I wish I could find that video...

I agree with you. The latter part of my comment was me playing devil's advocate. 
Apple has done a great job of polishing and cutting rough diamonds, a feat in itself.

How about you make a me a list of the possible password combinations using the information I remember about my password? 
@_date: 2013-04-02 08:17:11
So, like a Google Doc spreadsheet?

I hope you did. 8 Hours ago, BTC was around 114. Right now, 1:52 PCT, it's about 145.50.
That's a cool 15,000 dollar profit.

I thought he was going to name them. Disappointed.

It could be, but I trading a piggy bank isn't as preferable as handing over the doe inside :p

I'm selling my wallet, which has about 3.5 btc at a rate of 650 dollars each btc. Sorry for being unclear.

Library card = 8 char
Usual pass = 8 char
home add = Idk, depends if I abbreviated the "South" or "Drive". At least 15 char.

I only have 3.49 BTC. Does .12 BTC sound okay?
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:12:43
I'm selling it for about 2,267.85 cents. I have a little under 3.5 BTC at 650 each BTC.

Devil's advocate: 
BTC on MtGox hasn't changed even a ten-thousandths of a dollar for about 15 minutes now.
It's creeping me out a bit.
Seeing the screen stuck at 145.78998 isn't fun.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:53:57
I first bought in at 93, then again at ~190.
I need to sell at around 154 to break even on both entries. I'm optimistic that we'll see it get up there again.

Man. That's a lot info to take in. Can you link me to a comprehensive video? I've tried looking, but I haven't found any that are any good. They're usually just warnings.
