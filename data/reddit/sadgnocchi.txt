That is the average wait time for purchasing BTC. Coinbase takes about the same.

You'd be paying out the arse that way. Coinbase is an option but they suck. Looked at Gemini or Binance ?

Bitcoin transactions can take anywhere from 20-90 minutes to complete. I've heard of even longer. Network congestion is mostly at fault. More here:

For all purchases.

GDAX / Coinbase are the reason for this delay. 
Experiencing it myself - transferred earlier in the day and it was very quick. It's been well into 5 hours now. Binance has suspended new user registration; I'm sure they've had a huge influx of signups since people are leaving Coinbase.

Both of them sketch me out.

I am hoping this is the case. Where on status.coinbase do you see this ?

Should I move the Bcash to GDAX? They and Coinbase are one in the same so I'm apprehensive...neither trading or selling have been enabled yet.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:23:00
Thank you. This is why I'm avoiding GDAX - I don't want to place a sell order and would rather sell instantly via Coinbase; unless of course GDAX can beat the fee. (Exploring this now)
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:39:54
Thank you for this. Upvoting for visibility.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:25:27
Ah, thank you ! I was just about to ask this question
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:11:12
Probably degraded performance, do you need to sell; or just move ?
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:07:33
Not that I know of. I have been trying to do anything with my BCH via Coinbase to no avail.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:21:17
It's definitely very common right now. Have you tried moving to GDAX and then selling ? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:31:32
Try using GDAX; authenticates with your Coinbase creds.
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:27:41
This is unnerving. How long have you had an account with them? Have you transferred this large of an amount before ?
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:34:18
God damn BCH :(
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:41:44
Transferring BTC to GDAX is free; you use your Coinbase credentials to sign in.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:47:06
Coinbase and GDAX have shit themselves. Still stuck at the below prices commented 5 min ago.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:18:12
They're the only currency I keep on the exchange right now. Ready to dump. Everything else is in a hardware wallet.
