If you don't mind, I'm interested in your explanation.

Pumping charts up and making Bitcoin more attractive than it really is?
I'm not saying that it's not attractive, but that it's possible that people use that as a marketing weapon. Now I don't know anything about the costs that would be involved, so I wouldn't bet anything on it.

How much money is hoarded in USD, though?
@_date: 2014-12-26 09:07:16
That's why you pay people for reviewing something that you'll make cash on.
The point is to be attractive to people who value their time, which usually matches with competent people.

Frankly, your claim that "BCI has repeatedly fucked up" isn't really compatible with your lack of willingness to support this claim with sources ("wasting my time digging stuff").
I'm genuinely interested, as others I'm sure, to get some information on this subject, and I'm certainly not sold to any opinion yet.
If BCI had repeatedly fucked up, the evidence wouldn't require any real "digging".

Whatever your reasons are, you're not at liberty of taking such measures on your own.

I see a problem with the modification in itself but it's a matter of opinion. What doesn't depend on my personal stance is the way the modification should be pushed. Shouldn't be default.

"Currency is not for the masses, let them keep trading pigs and crops."
@_date: 2014-02-14 00:50:12
It's still a big deal, yes.
But in this kind of situation, it's primarily a matter of identifying the perimeter of the impact. The most basic question is: does this significantly impact the market or only SR? Since it doesn't impact the market too much, the issue drops from "potentially critical event" to "major event".

Considering the amount of people unhappy with MtGox's withdrawal process, what other places are you happy with?
The thread about MtGox alternatives is 9 months old, and much has changed since.

Good job!

What could possibly go wrong?!

Bitcoinwisdom has my love too.

Perceived obviousness is very different from proof.
@_date: 2017-01-03 10:58:11
It's interesting, thanks.
Do you have a place where I can easily overlay price with halving dates?
Edit: [considering there has been only two halvings, the first one being in November, 2012]( and considering the huge number of major variations there has been between the first halving and the second, I find it hard to correlate any given price change to a halving. There is definitely a link between price and block reward, but to say that the Christmas hype is linked to the July halving seems like a stretch to me.
In the end, we could wait an infinite amount of time for any given major price change, and arbitrarily choose to explain it by the previous halving.
@_date: 2017-08-21 13:01:07
At that point you need to provide proof, man.
@_date: 2017-08-06 14:45:58


That I can get behind. Cheers.

There's a lot more to success than technology. Tesla could have failed a number of ways anyway (they nearly did).
You did your homework, that's great. But there's no such thing as a sure thing. No matter how deeply you understand the technology, or the business, or both, it's still a risky investment.
Hell, if you understand it all and it's a sure thing, why not do it yourself?
@_date: 2017-01-03 09:36:24


Rightfully so. At the time, it wasn't worth that much, and there was no certainty that it would live to see 2017.
After-success reasoning is dangerous.
@_date: 2017-01-03 09:25:49
Any significant gain in a very short timeframe is artificial unless it can be linked to a very significant milestone when it comes to adoption or developments.
Unless I'm mistaken, nothing else than Christmas and 2017 has happened over the last two weeks, so it's at least somewhat artificial. I wouldn't get used to those prices right away.

Spreads will kill this system.
@_date: 2016-12-23 13:01:31
But how are the asks and the bids being matched?
Who gets to get paid by the highest bid? The highest ask?
If someone bids for 950$, and two people respectively ask for 949$ and 948$, who gets the 950$ offer?
If the 949$ one gets the 950$ one, does it mean that your BTC can virtually remain unsold if you ask too low of a price?
(too lazy to put the dollar sign in front now that I've remembered how you guys do it)

Bitcoin relies on economic incentives to recruit and retain miners that help protect the network instead of trying to take advantage from it. If the mining landscape is greener on BCH than BTC, it's only fair that miners move over to the more profitable operation.
It's not a loyalty contest.

used to talk about what is going to happen in the future, especially things that you are certain about or things that are planned


used to express possibility
Much better.

Although I don't agree with it being "extremely long", it's certainly a great addition to the read.
@_date: 2017-04-07 13:56:50
As someone whose general understanding of Bitcoin is way below this sub's well known regulars, I don't get why cASICBOOST doesn't drive the price equally down for full and empty blocks.
Could you please explain this?
Could you also explain why ASICBOOST as a whole is an attack rather than a clever optimization?
@_date: 2017-04-27 22:13:40
Because there seems to be a solid correlation between laziness and compulsive down-voting.
@_date: 2016-09-29 09:07:21
This is great.
If it comes to making translations out of it, I'll happily do the French one.

Except only the gains are taxed, which means that it's not the same money that's being taxed at that point.
@_date: 2015-04-30 05:57:48
So you're saying there's a chance?!

1. How much of your own money do you have in there?
2. How much benefit have you actually generated this year?
3. How much of that benefit have you actually taken out?
4. How much does that benefit weigh compared to your other sources of income?

The thing is that Bitcoin being worth 1700USD today doesn't retroactively make his bet smart. Whatever the outcome is, the quality of the decision doesn't derive from its result.
@_date: 2017-05-09 13:43:40
Isn't BTC supposed to crash shortly after he posts though?
@_date: 2017-07-29 06:45:13
I read what's posted here, obviously not for the personal attacks, but because I'm in a spot where I still need the occasional ELI5 rewording, and because good content occasionally surfaces from the comments.
Do you know of a place where I could find all that without the toxic behavior that we're witnessing right here?
I have to admit I haven't been looking very far, though.
@_date: 2016-07-27 20:48:23
Internationally, it's very possible.

So, as users, there's nothing we can do to prevent the 2MB HF from happening?
Is there any reason to think that the HF could fail? What is the likeliness of it happening?
