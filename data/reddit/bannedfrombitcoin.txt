Have you ever heard of Dogecoin?
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:33:42
In my experience, sometimes they’re willing to let it slide in store with manager approval. On the website though, it’s enforced.

Meanwhile the decentralized ledger just doesn't take holidays or know when the year ends.
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:37:53
lol ETH is still pretty much at an all time high. Hit 1000 last night.
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:02:10
You mean like regular old crypto subs?
@_date: 2018-01-01 06:01:54
I think Trent Reznor is a Bitcoin dev
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:11:42
ETH is chillin.

What ever happened to Gen X? It's like they either got merged into the boomers or millennials.
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:03:28
Yeah, my capital one account got cancelled on me with no reason or warning. Kinda figured it was because I used my credit card to buy some crypto.
@_date: 2018-01-01 07:16:25
Pretty sure he’s just talking about the price doing nothing.
@_date: 2018-01-08 22:08:05
Makes sense. I never even hear from my Gen X siblings because they're "just so busy" all the time. Guess if you don't even have time for family you don't have time for much else really.
Funny thing is they think I had it easy because I learned coding in high school, I went to college online, and now I work from home and get to hang out with my wife and kid all day. Those concepts weren't even really options for them growing up, and they're salty about it.
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:10:48
Lol yeah Bitcoin is just a bunch of 16 year olds casually trading 16 billion a day.


I just bought a hotel room with Bitcoin. Does that count as liquidating?
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:17:29
That Kanye meme is funny and true. For a lot of us, Bitcoin has treated us very well, but we simultaneously feel like it's always a risky time to tell someone to get into it...because the second they do it might crash, and then they feel like *you* screwed them.

The part that confuses me is how is the global debt so high? Who does the *world* owe money to and who is the one that is owed all the money if everyone is in debt?
It's something that only makes sense to people born in a debt bubble.
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:54:50
You’re allowed to gift something like 20,000 per person before it gets taxed too. Certain family members of mine have been doing this among family members to avoid them having to pay estate tax when they die.
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:13:34
Check again. Much closer to ATH than Bitcoin, that's for sure.
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:42:42
It would shorten the time required to mine all 21 million coins and we could experience a little bit of inflation from more coins being introduced if the block reward wasn't adjusted. Also it would require a hard fork anyway, so at that point we might as well just increase the block size instead of shortening the time.
@_date: 2018-01-01 06:05:53
I see you're trying to join my club by posting about an altcoin! Mods, sick 'em!
@_date: 2018-01-04 02:03:45
Then why did I have to make this account to begin with
@_date: 2018-01-14 00:58:31
It’s good to know we can say cunt here. banned me for calling some cunt a cunt, when he was quite clearly being a cunt.
@_date: 2018-01-03 04:03:03
Not for the people who aren't into crypto yet.

It’s lit up every new moon though. Maybe that’s what he means?
@_date: 2018-01-13 01:23:05
What a dick. Guys at the Denver store said it was hit or miss, depending on supply and who was working. I managed to buy 5 1080s.
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:42:26
If it did, that machine would sound like a blow dryer.
@_date: 2018-01-01 20:41:31
Also well known for giving ETAs of "soon"
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:49:11
If you say so....but I'll need a little more evidence to be convinced.
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:30:41
So the same thing that happens here if you ask the same thing about BCH?
@_date: 2018-01-15 01:22:37
Wrong. Everyone sees the “man on the moon” side no matter where you are on earth, because the moon is tidally locked. That said, during a new moon, the “dark side” of the moon is lit up.
@_date: 2018-01-01 06:04:28
He can have his opinion, but the particular opinion he came here to express was not particularly conducive to a legitimate conversation on fees and transaction times. Sounds like he's just here with the typical "It's a bubble with no value!" spiel.
@_date: 2018-01-02 03:17:45
If I make a coin tomorrow that has 800 kajillion premined coins, and someone agrees to pay $.01 for some, then the market cap would be bigger than Bitcoin's.
For a similar reason, we're currently seeing Ripple in second place.
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:28:50
It is kinda funny that it's such an even interval and looks like a stairway though.
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:44:58
Either way would require a hard fork, and if the entire network doesn't agree, we get some new altcoin out of it fighting for the rights to be called the real Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:13:30
So like the things Apple didnt do until version 10? lol.
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:56:33
You mean *exp*ire?

Kenton! Holy shit, this guys deserves to be a meme. Check out ReWildUniversity if you haven't yet.
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:45:07
Don't forget more Litecoin miners went on sale today, and can only be bought with BCH.
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:50:34
Check out ReWildUniversity on YouTube - he's got some really awesome survival videos and deserves way more viewers.

Why won't anyone give me a million dollar business loan then? Obviously I'd be able to flip it into a billion and pay them back right?
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:55:00
Bitmain.com - I bought one.
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:14:00


Yeah sure.
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:12:22
If you're risking the type of money required to make your money increase 1000 fold, I don't think that is true. I think it's the same either way. Plenty of millionaires have blown their fortune. Especially inheritances.
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:28:20
Ban this man!
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:28:53
Says the guy arguing with ad hominem. Do you have a valid rebuttal or are you just going to insult my intelligence?
Why can't my million dollar business plan be "It'll be easier to make into a billion"?
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:13:10
I'm just jaded by the argument that it's easy to become a billionaire if you have a million given to you. If that's the case, why are there so few billionaires compare to millionaires? 
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:03:46
Such proof. Much work.
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:44:40
You can still lose *a lot* of money doing that. What if you bought a million dollars of real estate at the top of the housing bubble? Now you're not a millionaire anymore.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:17:58
I don't believe that. There's still risk involved with anything that is going to grow your money 1000x. Doesn't matter if it's real estate or bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:35:03
Better that it can be unexpectedly destroyed than unexpectedly created.
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:28:46
Well yes, because if you think it's "run by shills", then you either don't know that Bitcoin is an *open source* software project, or don't actually know what that means. So you've already been conditioned with misinformation, and usually it's harder to reverse that than to give people the correct info the first time.
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:15:22


Maybe it has something to do with the "currency" still being incapable of making reasonable transactions. Fix the network and Bitcoin's value may just continue to skyrocket.
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:34:52
That's so funny to hear on a bitcoin subreddit....Isn't mining bitcoin getting money for doing nothing?
Maybe in the future UBI will be paid by all of us having miners in our houses, and all of the brains of the automated computers will be controlled via the blockchain to give them one decentralized brain comprised of millions of individual tasks, grouped onto sidechains and such. This way we will all control the robots via mining and can prevent them from going rogue through distributed consensus.
But yeah, I personally think blockchain mining could be the future of UBI. Could be the only way to prevent the robots from killing us all.
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:26:06
Why because they might actually be the reason Bitcoin is being held back right now?
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:04:46
You came here with an idea in your head already. At this point in life I know better than to try and change what you already think you know. That's a fool's game.
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:03:24
Nah, you just don't know how to answer that. If it was that easy to make a million into a billion, everyone would do it.
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:30:07
Oo oo ah ah! I also like to fling my own shit.
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:53:20
On the other hand, what does it say about the BCash crowd if they're providing news about both coins and the "Core" side is removing posts/comments/people who talk about BCH? Meanwhile the Ripple shills are out in force the past couple days and seem to get their shilling done with no problem. It's weird.
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:35:41
To be fair to Trumpy, turning a million dollars into a billion is numerically the same as turning a thousand into a million.
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:06:15
How's that relevant to a guy who we all know is rich and never claimed to have started from nothing? I'm just saying it's just as hard to become a multi-billionaire from investing a million, as it is to become a multi-millionaire from investing a thousand.
Hell, nowadays thanks to bitcoin, you could say that the latter was even easier for some.
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:28:41
Bitcoin is pre-mined? Huh? Elaborate...
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:04:31
I see you're trying to join my little club!
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:46:32
Nah hey man, you're completely entitled to your own opinion. I'm sure you've done hours and hours of research to come to your own conclusions about the technology before coming here and making negative comments about it. 
You'd never base your opinion on what the media and other people say about something they don't really understand, right? 
After all, there's probably a whole college degree worth of info out there on the topic of cryptocurrencies, and a whole lot of evidence pointing towards them being an emerging asset class.
Eh, what am I saying...right now I'm just having fun making monkey noises and creating projectiles from my excrement. Don't kill my vibe.
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:18:15
If you're asking this question, then just take my advice, and don't.
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:57:52
Oh man that must have made her soo... happy?
