We are investigating our logs and we were able to identify a few invalid transactions. We are finishing our investigations and will reinstate the affected accounts back to the previous state so no bitcoins will be lost at all.

Hi there,
This is Gustavo Guida from BTCJam.
I want to officially tell you that was no hack whatsoever. We already identified a user that entered a PHP script as a comment. Our website doesn't even run on PHP. The only thing happened was that the PHP script broke the Javascript of the page. 
We already banned the user and we're conducting further investigations to make sure everything is fine.
We're also taking the necessary measures to avoid this ti happen again.

The correct net return is 18%, for investors with more than 80 investments on their plans. That means, removing the expected defaults (for users that missed payments) investors that are using AutoInvest in it's full potential are getting 18% returns.
Please read more on our blog:

We use risk-based pricing, that means the defaults are offset by the higher rate we charge for borrowers with higher chances to default. Our proprietary credit score algorithm is 90% right, outscoring FICO and p2p industry leaders. 
In other words, if the investor diversifies will have an expected return of 18%. Without diversifying each default might have a big impact on the portfolio's return. AutoInvest is the BEST way to diversify without the hassle of hand-pick hundreds of loans.
The default oscillates between 10-15% today. But again, are already incorporated on the interest rates we charge.

Hello Samuel,
This is Gustavo Guida, BTCjam CPO.
I'm sorry you're feeling frustrated since your interest rates had a spike because our algorithm changed your credit score. Specifically, we have communicated directly with you. In fact our CEO responded to you on Facebook directly.  As an individual trying to borrow, I can understand why you are frustrated. 
While you were passionate - there were inaccuracies in your statements, I would like to explain how we calculate APR and the expected returns for investors (even though you are a borrower and not an active investor as you admit).
APR stands for annual percentage rate and is the monthly rate multiplied by 12. It's not ^12 as we do in Brazil.
Also, the Current AutoInvest returns are calculated considering: (i) ALL late payments will incur in defaults; (ii) ALL current payments will keep paying. Every time there’s a payment to be made we update the returns based on the payment activity. We believe this is a fair way to look at the returns until all the loans mature.
Lastly, to compute the APR - normalize all terms into monthly results and then multiply by 12. Simply because a 1-month loan that pays back 10% has a APR of 120% while a 1-year loan with the same 10% return has an APR of 10%. 
So, all that being said, your statement that we have a 48% fraud rate is completely wrong.
I appreciate that you brought this subject up because clearly we need to spend more time explaining how we operate and calculate the formulas we show on the website.
Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any other questions.
