I started my 'investment' path by buying bitcoins and alt coins. I get to know value investing last year and is investing in stock market since then. Whenever I feel Iike gambling, I open up Binance, pick the 'potential' coin and hodl. Because there is nothing you can study for crypto, I am also a nobody outside of the scene. When the news come, the price hike, insiders have already skyrocketed the price. In stock market, there is hidden gem you will be rewarded if study hard,  now that I don't call it speculation as I know what I am investing and doing.

If you have learned what is 'investment', then you will know BTC is not a real 'investment', it's 'speculation'. That's why big investor like Warren Buffet despise crypto
