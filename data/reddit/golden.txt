Would a soft fork decreasing the limit to 0.5MB be an "attack" as well?
What makes something an attack vs an enhancement/upgrade?

They may not agree with how the fork is being implemented, but may agree with the goal of a larger block size.

That's misguided for so many reasons.
1) You don't know if he's an engineer/expert
2) Nobody gets to dictate what is Bitcoin. Not corporations, not experts. 
3) It's clear that experts disagree whether or not to increase blocksize
4) Segwit wasn't a compromise. It would have been proposed even without big block proposals. One side wanted no Segwit and big blocks, one side wanted small blocks and Segwit. The compromise was to have big blocks and Segwit

Thanks! You've piqued my interest.
Segwit2x has no replay protection. Since it doesn't, my coin can be stolen.
In the possible event that 2x activates, How can someone steal my coin? What can I do to protect my coin? and the reverse, what actions would put me at risk? 
@_date: 2017-08-20 23:50:59
That's fair. I wouldn't mind seeing replay protection implemented in Segwit2x

Trump leading to an escape to gold -- is just scaremongering.
The people who typically buy gold, aren't scare of Trump because they already have been under fiscally liberal administration for nearly a decade.
The people who are terrified of Trump cling to the USD too much to let it go for gold/bitcoin. They're out marching today, not bunkering down.

I did not know this. How can they do that? What if I just keep my coin in my wallet and don't spend?
Would replay protection stop this exploit?

So, regular Segwit, pre NYA, included a blocksize increase? What did NYA add?

They may not agree with how the fork is being implemented, but my agree with the goal of a larger block size.

You had me til point 4. Why not use the most open licensing possible? To avoid competing protocols? Does Bitcoin need men with guns to protect it?
Without that, 3 and 5 may not happen. Both protocols can be made interoperable, and the layer 2 solutions can support both as well.

Ah Ol' Hitley
You're making 2x sound like a good idea.

This sucks. I just reformatted my Windows PC and want to reinstall CoPay, not BitPay.
How can I do that? does anyone have the exe I can use? or is there a guide?
EDIT: found the Sep7 Installer. I hope they continue to maintain it, so I can continue to have security patches.
Is there a competitor wallet to CoPay which supports HD Multisig wallets, with Windows and Mobile apps?

Oh, how innocent! ;)

I agree, that everyone including everything nation is accountable for developing themselves. I don't think he was suggesting 3rd world needs others help. He was suggesting that Bitcoin solves a real problem for the third world, and they are developing themselves, by using this technology.

Why?
