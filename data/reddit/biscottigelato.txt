Hey all! Maker of the wallet here. Thanks for giving it a try! Yeah the wallet is still not very reliable that's why I haven't really advertised it too much. Primary problem is, running LND on iOS is still fairly uncharted territories. Another person mentioned Coinclip. They try to improve reliability by killing and restarting the daemon everytime you background the app. They also enforce discovery of 1000 nodes before allowing you to create the first channel. Regardless, at the end of the day there's still a lot more work needed for LND to run as smoothly on mobile as they do on desktop.
That's why I open sourced it early on in the game. The hope is this will act as a test harness so there will be more focus on LND development specifically for running on mobile. In this case iOS of course. At the end of the day many of us can build fancy UI wrappers but LND is the real hero behind it all.

Yeah. I think there’s a thin wallet and Shango they are remote node/cloud node

You can Airdrop the log to your laptop. Fast change LND debug level. And if you compile it (defaults in debug mode), you can also fast change Neutrino node. Do note a bad host will crash LND and you have to re-upload lnd.conf to recover. That's why I didn't open it up for the TestFlight release. I reported the problem here. Haven't got any yay-nay yet. Not that good in Golang here to be honest.
I am focusing on trying to get manual channel opening stable before autopilot. Otherwise there might be too many layers of error and failures to peel through?

Might be good to mention if some of them has the lightning node in phone or lightning node on cloud. And whether you control the private key.

Does this analysis have any merit? I still feel that the biggest problem of Bitcoin is actually the way they are mined. Scalability might be achievable through Level 2. Privacy can potentially be enhanced by more development and innovation. But as long as it's Proof of Work, the electricity required is just bonkers?
And assuming that Bitcoin market cap do get to $10s of trillions eventually, on-chain transactions would only be affordable for whale sized transactions? Doesn't that imply a certain level of Level 2 centralization also to aggregate channel closure to the $ million level before it's worth the cost required for an on-chain transaction?

Hey, I've also been wondering about a Lightning mobile wallet also!
I just spent a good part of the past year launching a somewhat polished Swift based app. Looking for the next project to build and have been eyeing the blockchain space for months. 
C background professionally before going solo. And acquired extensive iOS &amp; Swift experience since. Some backend experience with Node.js via Typescript. But also did a lot of the graphics work for UI &amp; even video work for marketing. So I'd boast that I'm kinda a jack of all trade (not sure how masterful of any tho..)
That said, 0 experience on OSS dev experience also. Despite saying that its non-profit, I'm still a lil worried, as any project like this will probably quickly become my full time attention with big opportunity cost from my side...

3 BTC block reward already accounted for halving. If there are $10M+ revenue per block, pretty certain there will be people spending a good fraction of that to mine, be in that equipment or electricity cost. The block difficulty is irrelevant in this discussion as it’s only a mechanism to throttle the average block time to 10 minutes. The difficulty doesn’t play into the economic incentive directly aside from being a by-product of the competitive mining hash rate there is out there, which is a result of the investment in mining equipment and electricity, which again is because of the revenue to be made (bitcoin price x block reward).
Even if electricity is only 10% of the cost, and the operating cost is 50% or revenue, we are still talking about
$32M x 50% x 10% ~= $1.5M per block. That is still a lot of electricity spent to mine a block. Extremely expensive if it’s still a 1MB block 10 years later. Not to mention how burning all these electricity is pretty bad for the environment.
I still don’t see a sound argument on how Proof of Work can be scalable if Bitcoin becomes the global reserve. And this is even if bulk of the transaction goes off-chain to LN...
Would love to see someone make a sound argument against this instead of calling the article names.

But how about the energy/power aspect of it? To be the global currency that does imply a certain level of transactions being conducted with it, but I agree it doesn't mean necessarily a high number of transactions, but just high value in aggregate transactions.
Energy tho, I think that's a legitimate critique? If BTC is the global reserve and worth $trillions, and each block's rewards is thus north of $10M, there'll be incentive for people to spend millions in electricity per block to mine? I don't see that sustainable?

I see it. It’s on and off. Super weird. I suggest opening in Chrome or Safari if not already. Maybe it’s cuz loading it inside the Reddit mobile app
@_date: 2018-04-17 17:40:41
Testflight or Github by any chance?

The problem is with phones, especially iPhones, it’s hard to have it running all the time and monitor the channels for ‘cheating’. The use case for lightning receive on a phone is also relatively narrow. So until ‘Watchtowers’ are in place, the idea is to keep fund receive only on-chain.

Which link was broke for you? I just tried and worked for me. Hmm

I am an independent Swift developer looking for a new project to work on. Thinking if it's a good idea to start yet another effort to create an iOS Lightning Wallet. It seems there are several (mostly closed sourced) efforts. But still, there are no functional iOS wallet rivalling what they have over on Android-land... 
I have since put together an InVision prototype (link below). Knowing that UX is important to the adoption of Lightning and Bitcoin in general, I am hoping to get some feedback on UX before I start committing a lot of code. It’ll be awesome if you can give the InVision prototype a test-drive. You can comment directly in InVision, or just ping me right here. Thanks so much!

Password &amp; Password confirm can definitely be on the same page. You are right.
Any ideas to make transaction/channel change more intuitive? 
@_date: 2018-04-14 04:51:58
Sorry only familiar with Swift here. The one time I had to deal with JS I almost lost it. Typescript made it manageable but definitely not preferred. Too spoiled by Type-safety and Xcode IDE here ��

Even with Safari/Chrome? Were you able to get past the first screen? Does it go back to invalid link ever after the first screen?
