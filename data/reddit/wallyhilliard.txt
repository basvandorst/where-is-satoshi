~ 7:05: "There is no bitcoin office.  They can't just run in there with their usual swat teams..."
I think they should be referred to as "death squads". When Darryl Gates renamed them "swat teams" for the domestic market, surely it was to humiliate Boobus even beyond what they'd done to Central American peasants and the like.  And if they didn't name them "swat" teams they couldn't extend the metaphor and refer to what's left of us as "bug-splat" which they've taken to doing recently

His highest obligation is to the Bill of Rights, not to unconstitutional statutes passed by traitorous legislators.

In order for TCP/IP to be an effective tool of resistance against the omnipotent state, I think alternative internet(s) must be built to compete against the internet(s) where the state controls the ISPs and network media.
Perhaps development advances in mesh networks and decentralized and distributive systems will come to the rescue.  But I think it remains to be seen whether the immutable tool of TCP/IP can be used to effectively resist the violence of the state.

More like a controlled nuclear explosion every other day.  You think setting off 10,000 all at once would somehow penetrate the skulls of Boobus-Americanus?

What does it matter where the modern regime "fits"?  Its either a kidnapping, torturing, mass surveillance, and mass murder state or it isn't.

That's true. If you want to sell apples from a cart in Shanghai, you just get some apples and a cart and you're in business.  In L.A. or New York, you have to let some guy like Law-less look up your ass and file for 20 different licenses and permits.

Well said.
In some ways I look at the current Dollar Empire as just the latest revision of the top down monopolistic system of control all commerce that the Romans invented.  So this isn't just a political empire that stands to collapse but a thousand year system of control similar to chattel slavery--which also eventually collapsed by the way.

I like it when the TV people say "intelligence community".  There's something about the way the words roll of their lips when they say it that makes me feel safe and proud to know that here in the U.S. where everything is good we have "communitarians" doing the torturing and false flag provocations whereas in bad countries like Russia and Germany they have evil KGB, Stasi, and SS.

Interesting take on the fascinating confluence amongst cryptography, computer science, and libertarian monetary and legal theory.
This interesting post by Szabo points to the pro-state/anti-libertarian skew of establishment academia as being a big factor in bitcoin being so late to the party after the deployment of the internet:
"The overlap between cryptographic experts and libertarians who might sympathize with such a "gold bug" idea is already rather small, since most cryptographic experts earn their living in academia and share its political biases."

I think bitcoin will not end the vital economic functions of saving, lending, and banking.  On the contrary it has the potential to allow these functions to flourish like never before.
Bitcoin threatens the U.S. dollar monopoly and by extension the U.S. dollar saving, lending, and banking industries.  And most importantly bitcoin threatens the U.S. dollar "printing" ("mining") industry.
Up until now all threats to the U.S. dollar monopoly have been crushed.  Back in the 1990's the Empire felt threatened by a low tech yet sophisticated barter network in Tennessee.  So they sent in their legions to put down the rebellion.
As I recall the IRS busted the barter network for not keeping track of all their asset transactions and paying their cut to the Empire--in the same way as they just announced they are going to command of all those who trade in bitcoin.
The barter network defendants won the criminal case in a hard fought and expensive jury trial.  The Empire lost the battle but won the war as nobody would dare try to operate such a centralized system under the noses of the soldiers quartered in our economic midst knowing that they would just keep prosecuting anybody who tried it again.
It was the same with Egold.  Perhaps bitcoin will be different.
The Roman system depends on a scorched earth strategy.  As long as there's just one 5 year old kid standing on top of a bombed-out pile of rubble shaking his fist at a helicopter the Empire has lost Afghanistan and the generals know it.  But they won't let the U.S dollar go so easily.

I just heard Andreas use this term in his discussion with Ernie Hancock on freedomsphoenix.  
I'm a little adverse to the term because it conjures up the bad ideas tied into any "cracy"--i.e., it implies somebody is ruling somebody.  
But it also suggests the idea that the "Mundanes" who are usually on the "ruled" end of the equation are de-powering the usual elite rulers.  So its a good term to use to appeal to the good instincts of lefties.

"Keep in mind America is less than %5 of the worlds population. Their laws don't matter to the vast majority of the planet."
The Evil Empire has over 1000 military bases in 100+ colonies that stretch across the globe.
When it inevitably perceives that its monopoly control of all commerce is threatened by bitcoin it will attempt to crush it with overwhelming violence like it has always done to all other threats to its monopoly control.  The only "law" that exists in the realm of Pax-Americana is that the Empire's might makes right.

"Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun".  Mao learned his lessons well from the Yankee church ladies and soccer moms who've been hiring hit men like Lawsky since they first began their spread west from New England.

I'd say there's more imperial waxing going on than poetical.  And those waxers will throw an apocalyptic tantrum rather than stand helplessly by while witnessing the waning of their empire.
The modern Romans will attempt to deal with bitcoin the same way they dealt with those tax-resisting dis-obedient Jews in 70 AD.  If they get their way "not one [block] here will be left [chained] to another, which will not be torn down".  How's that?

"demo" (democracy) means "power to the people" to lefties and others.  Its a powerful syllable.

Me too! He's just as insightful and knowledgeable as ever in his Liberty Reports.  He's real good in this one where he identifies the potential escalation of crackdowns posed by Sessions/Trump on what remains of our freedom and privacy:
