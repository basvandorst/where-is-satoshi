All I know is I put in $230 in a week ago and it's now worth $200. That's not really good

Ill say it once and I'll say it again, online poker is THEE reason BTC has been on an upswing. Easily 50% of all BTC transactions these days are for online poker in the U.S. as soon as the government legalizes online poker, BTC will crash and be essentially useless. All you holders are holding onto a dream and 1 factor, poker.

You dig through people's post history to validate your existence. You need to get over yourself

Yes. Big time. I paly on ACR, they only accept Bitcoin since online gambling is somewhat a grey area

It's a hypothetical question as stated in the very first word of my OP. Why are some of you one this sub so fucking toxic? Really, go fuck yourself.
@_date: 2019-08-10 16:38:07
Nah I'm good right now.

I'm sure the farmers want *something* for their food? I mean there would naturally become an economic/barter system
@_date: 2019-08-10 16:23:51
And we're just supposed to believe that? I mean who *controls* the price?
@_date: 2019-08-09 16:02:14
Was that hard? Or is it easier to be a pretentious know-it-all?
@_date: 2019-08-05 12:35:32
Online poker boom in America. Literally driving the price up.

So basically what you're saying is that Gold&gt;BTC in the apocalypse?
@_date: 2019-08-13 14:50:07
As an ex junkie I absolutely despise people like you. His business is not your business, this isn't a concerned question of yours, it's to belittle and make fun of him. Loser.

Yes, brings me back to the Full Tilt days.
