Bad timing for something to happen while making a bitcoin transaction from a wallet on your computer to a merchant.


Sounds like you have it under control.

So you will pay 250$ to get it instantly and anonymously through a trusted broker. I think the spread between coinbase and localbitcoins can be as much as 50$ for .5 BTC so you are paying 5x the price that others pay when using localbitcoins. 
You really should get your broker to use a shared wallet with you and use mutl-sig to keep him from running off with your coins.

Is there not a conflict of interest here, why would retailers want to share customer sales info with Amazon? Sure lower fees for now but how will that matter when your sales data is used against you.

Point  is spot on. I'm still shocked (SHOCKED) at the number of seemingly real humans who will take 2 minutes to craft a reply to a bitcoin article along the lines of "Can someone please explain in simple terms? How exactly are these computers "mining" bitcoins? And how does this help the whole bitcoin economy/industry?" yet they won't take 2 seconds to look it up for themselves

Nice. Charity Water is a good choice. In.

Not 'the official' currency, but AN official currency. I imagine bitcoin as a container for official state currency.
Like a codec for cash.

Looks great. 
Homepage: Grey on grey is usually frowned on due to lack of contrast.
Same with the thin-line logo. A little hard to see with large monitors, old eyes
Otherwise, looks fresh.
