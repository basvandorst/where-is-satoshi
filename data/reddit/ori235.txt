I thought altcoins discussion is forbidden...

Would you really expect a new fork that exists less then half a year to have more developers and stars then 9 years chain? Those metrics don't indicate which one is better.

Most of them don't have a block explorer, so it's not so simple. If you know of a fork that has a block explorer and is not listed in my website, please tell me about it

Where have you seen someone claims that bitcoin cash has more developers?
@_date: 2018-01-12 07:05:45
Yes, but they don't claim to have more development because of this, they just claim that it's more decentralized because of this (pretty stupid argument in my opinion)
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:20:14
It's a very different claim! They don't claim to have more development.
Actually, sometimes they claim to have less development, because they think that some new features (RBF, segwit, etc) are against Satoshi's vision. This makes this comparison even more misleading.

They can also use Bitcoin's multisig
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:25:11
They can also use multisig, and then you won't have to trust them (although I doubt they will actually do it)

How Segwit enables more efficient data storage?
@_date: 2019-06-20 08:14:55
I used your software couple of times to browse bitcoin's leveldb. Very nice.

BCH team plan to adopt bech32 addresses as well, so I think they will be indistinguishable from segwit addresses
@_date: 2017-11-26 11:06:35
really? Works perfectly fine for me. Can you give a screenshot?
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:50:14
The coffeeshop can decide that they don't accept transactions that are marked as RBF
@_date: 2019-01-27 05:51:53
Why do we need to randomize locktime?

Am I the only one who read it as "lying Proof of Stake"?
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:30:08
I think segwit change address were not supported, and a full segwit HD wallet was missing as well

I don't think it's possible... If you receive a payment you just sign a new balance. The channel state does not know if it's less or more then the previous balance.

Segwit is a block size increase. It's just a very weird and unpredictable way to increase the block size, because the block size is affected by how other players transact (how many people use segwit, what is the witness size, etc).
