Trying to guess one of 1600^12 (~10^38 ) seeds is like trying to guess a 20 character password containing A-Z, a-z, 0-9 and all symbols.
If 1 million people use Electrum, trying to find *any one* of their seeds is the same as trying to guess a 16 character password. If you set up a server farm to guess 1B passwords per second (over the network!!), you'd be able to do it in less than 8,925,512,960,129 years.

This Is Good News not because it's a new method for bitcoin believers to accept bitcoin payments on their website, but because it increases bitcoin's exposure and legitimacy to thousands of sellers who use and trust Stripe.

Interesting post. I had no idea how much bandwidth it would take to run a hyperactive node. It's surprising (well, at least to me) how little traffic it needs.
Any kind of multithreading is pointless here, I agree.

There are at least a few people running bots 24x7 (I hope they're at least multithreaded @ 10MB/s) to catch coins sent to that address. Why would someone want to risk a race against them?
Plot Twist: Unless it's the person running most of these bots.
