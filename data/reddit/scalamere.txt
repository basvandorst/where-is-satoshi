I’ve deposit a similar amount in cash before after selling a vehicle, I can’t imagine it that uncommon

Dunno if you sorted this but I actually had to call the bank this morning and remembered your post... I asked if there was a limit I could just bring in to deposit as cash and the guy on the phone said “no limits” but I suspect if you turned up with 100k in used notes they would probably question it. This was NatWest FYI

This and only this holding it back. What could they do to actually make it easy for the average user without compromising on safety?

I consider myself relatively tech savvy, and it's not that easy for the average Joe. That is the only thing in my eyes even slightly holding bitcoin back. Sure anyone can make an exchange of fiat to bitcoin on something like coinbase, but things that actual make it a form of usable currency for the regular user is quite confusing and also relatively daunting. Transferring to a wallet, sending someone money still fills me with a lot of apprehension, I would be immensely scared of doing something stupid if I was sitting on a large sum.

I'm very much new to bitcoin, i've been researching as much as I can understand (whilst doing my job). A lot of people in here mentioned coinbase being bad customer service etc, i'm about to open an account with them now, are there better alternatives that people would recommend? 
Absolutely excuse the basics questions, very much knew to this and the whole concept so it's a steep learning curve right now.

As someone completely new to BTC this is really helpful. I'm about to buy my first round of bitcoins from coinbase(The reason being it just seemed the most user friendly for my first time).
From what I understand from my attempts at understanding how it all works. I should basically just get them out of there as soon as I can? As someone who is only going to be putting in small amounts probably monthly, is it best or most efficient to move my money from Coinbase to a wallet every time I do this, or maybe wait a few months and move a larger amount at once? Are there reason for an against this?
Ideally for security I would like a hardware wallet but is there a particular wallet I can use online that you would recommend? Are the online wallets really that much less secure than a hardware wallet or am I just being overly cautious about opening one? What would the security process be online, is it just a password that is the barrier between someone and my bitcoins?
Thank you in advance, I appreciate these are all just really basic questions but it's a steep learning curve for me on this one.

As a complete novice myself I would like to know from other users what they consider the best method. Is coinbase a safe place to store BTCs long term or would people recommend moving them out to a hard wallet or another online wallet?

Interesting article about manipulation of the market. Despite that, my biggest concern with the article is with that font I keep reading Ghina and Grypto.

Perfect answer thank you, so from what I gather, until i'm comfortable not being an idiot (Losing a hardwallet, bit of paper, posting my keycode online) you would recommend leaving coinbase to look after. I can't see myself ever putting in absolutely huge amounts of cash, so I trust coinbase that far.
In terms of the insurance on coinbase, I'm actually based in the UK so would any insurance be null and void if lets say I lost 5BTC?!
Again thank you ever so much, I think i'm going to take steps to 2FA my coinbase and put some money in and enjoy the ride!

Thanks very much for this. I'm reluctant to buy a hard wallet just because the amount i'm currently using is so small, a $100 wallet is a significant cut of that, obviously if things go the right way then maybe i'll end up investing.
For now coinbase seems the most user friendly and easy to understand entry in to Bitcoins and for that I'm quite happy to use for the time being. I'll go ahead and try and work out how to set up 2FA.
Can you explain further the accidental connecting to internet / address situation?
Thanks again, this really helped keep my mind at rest about Coinbase.

Question for a relatively new investor about when to buy in more. I've been increasing my bitcoins and when I have a bit of spare cash around. How should I go forward putting in more, i'm reluctant to put in more just now as it's the highest it's been in a long time. Obviously if it just keeps going up and up now would be a great time, but is there likely to be another bit of a dip sooner rather than later I could jump on?
@_date: 2017-10-12 09:55:57
Completely understand, it's all speculation until it happens.
Thanks guys.

You get paid to give blood in the US?!
@_date: 2017-10-12 09:29:58
Thank you. I just think if there is anything that is likely to make it drop again would be prime time but obviously don't want to hold on if it does the opposite and keeps going to the moon!
