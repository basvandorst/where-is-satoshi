Why do you say that?

And if any funds ever get sent to a previous address, then what? In practice, the vendor-locked fence is pretty strong.
@_date: 2015-06-30 18:53:13
the first part is a bit noisy but the rest is fine. once you start listening to AA it doesn't matter. he's on point.

iOS to iOS or iOS to Android?

Why not fork Hive/Breadwallet and make BIP44-compliant alternatives?
@_date: 2015-06-03 13:48:19
And completely rewriting the rules of finance with a decentralized currency *isn't* hard?
@_date: 2015-06-03 12:59:51
But one is BIP44 compliant while the other is not…meaning the addresses they generate are completely different. That's the problem.

THIS! How can we have universal money without a universally-standard wallet? Crazy.

But that doesn't help if your device is lost/stolen/broken. Hence the value of the seed in the first place.
@_date: 2015-06-03 15:02:17
That sounds very helpful. Thanks.

…provided you have the same software you originated that super-secret.
 
And if you don't? S.O.L. Well, I guess that's bitcoin. Much S.O.L.

Hey did Breadwallet get BIP44 compatibility recently?
@_date: 2015-06-03 12:52:19
LOL! My frustration has motivated me to move from lurker status.
@_date: 2015-06-03 13:28:28
Really, that's your answer? Bitcoin…all the choice of Soviet Russia!
@_date: 2015-06-30 16:04:36
He's legit. @_date: 2015-06-03 14:00:19
Fair enough. Edited.
@_date: 2016-01-15 16:47:38
So how do you see this playing out?
@_date: 2015-07-10 20:35:43
Pre-emptive censorship. Well done, Lawsky. LOLZ NYC!
@_date: 2015-07-07 15:24:07
…and they have since July 2014 --

Does anyone know who is actually organizing the event? No "about us" with real people on the site.

If you want no ID then do in-person transactions on LocalBitcoins with Mycelium wallet w/Tor enabled. You're not buying bitcoins online without ID.
@_date: 2016-07-05 18:24:28
You mean like PopChest or Watch My Bit or Yours or Steemit or Alexandria or LBRY?
@_date: 2016-07-06 11:40:04
Glad to help. Good luck. What's it going to be called?
