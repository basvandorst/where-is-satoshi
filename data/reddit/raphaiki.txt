I agree with most of what you've said, though I think it will be used to price things instead of being priced in things.
In terms of data networks, I think Bitcoin has the best chance of surviving. Banks rely on being multinational, and having financial control over their assets and liabilities. Those things get nationalised, invaded, taken down, or locked down during wars.

Not really, technically you can run Bitcoin locally, I doubt that any likely nuclear war would destroy all Bitcoin nodes around the world. Let alone the three nodes in Space.

I guess you have a point with regard to access to information. But with Net Neutrality, and the recent Bill by the EU, I am coming across more and more censored content. I'm like constantly shadow banned on twitter for example. And just look at Facebook. Even reddit has gone on a PC purge. Even my VPN access gets compromised sometimes. 
I don't disagree with you. But I still think it's getting harder and harder to hear all sides of the story again. Like before. But I feel that this is also pushing people to more decentralised options. So it could be a blessing in disguise.

You're right, I was doubling the current death rate for cancer in the UK. Its near 1/3.

Woah, that's pretty dark. But yeah it's PLAUSIBLE. But I still think that because of the first 911, there will be aversion to belief in a future one. They would need to do a good job at making it believable for it to work. Nuking a military base, might do it though.

I don't think there is a possible scenario where total annihilation would be garenteed. Human beings are stupid, but we're not as suicidal as we'd like to think.
We would probably use small scale nuclear arms, and threaten M. A. D. untill all parties reached a compromise.

If there was a full reactor breach?

I wish what you were saying is going to be the case. 
I hope you're right, but in 2002 or 2003 I saw 2 million people protest the Iraq War in London, and it didn't change anything. Tony still lied to the public and told them Saddam had WMDs that can hit London in 45 minutes. 
Over 50% of people believe the 911 official report is wrong. And if Russia sank a US aircraft carrier, what would stop the US from hypothetically having a Syrian and/or Russian man doing another 911?
History tells us two things about Revolutions. One is that they don't happen over night, and secondly is that they don't usually happen peacefully.
I still feel that my scenario is a more likely outcome than M. A. D.

Mesh Networks and Satellite can be used without Internet for the nodes.
But miners most likely need the net.

Well sorry you feel offended by my brains hypotheticals....
