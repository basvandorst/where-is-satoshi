There's a lot to say about the benefits of a global decentralized currency, honestly though, for most people in the developed world with access to banking, who don't have to wire large sums of money internationally frequently, there aren't many reasons you'd want to convert to crypto. Recognize tho that only represents about 2 billion of the 7 billion people on the planet. 
I'm not really following your logic for how sharing a currency/infrastructure with developing countries adversely effects the economy in the US. If crypto can pull another 1 or 2 billion people into the global financial system, and allow them to access capital more easily, why do you feel that would be a bad thing? Are you assuming that the global economy is zero-sum?

Batching transactions centralizes the network. If I withdraw funds, I want them confirmed on the blockchain now. I don't want to wait for coinbase to decide when to deposit them or to batch them at the end of the day.
The issue isn't coinbase saving space on the bitcoin blockchain by settling transactions off chain or at the end of a day, the issue is with bitcoin itself. This network was not built for the traffic it currently receives, the protocols code is far behind other solutions, is too slow, and wastes too much energy. Miners and developers have conflicting interests and there is no leadership to brand and drive the vision of the future. The bitcoin protocol is nothing more than a novelty at this point.

I think your reasoning is sound. I would love to see an estimate of what % of bitcoin is lost. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:47:28
Wouldn't batching withdrawals essentially centralize a majority of the network? If an exchange doesn't instantly oblige customers withdrawal requests, aren't they essentially a deposit institution backed by the full faith and credit of the...blockchain, or a bank.

I think the biggest questions I would have for a municipal leader would be opportunities for blockchain applications in local civics. Property registrars for example, can tampa work with the county to implement blockchain based property assessors. Maybe general city data could be moved to a decentralized cloud network for enhanced security purposes instead of on dropbox.

False, most exchanges are requiring you to enter your social security number to setup an account. By assigning a social to your bitcoin account, the blockchain becomes the most conveniently audit-able and transparent ledger that exists. Every transaction ever made will exist on the blockchain as long as the blockchain exists, presumably forever.

idk i think he's wrong, gentrification or the unweirding of the internet/social media/etc isn't a strategic policy or marketing decision, it's the result of a slow drip of economic forces watering down the 'weird vibes' and drowning out, rather than displacing the weirdness. 
The 'weirdos'/creators can try to fork protocols all they want to try and maintain network 'purity' the same way they can still use message boards instead of facebook, but by the time Dapps are ubiquitous in basic infrastructure for things in day to day life, it won't matter what the weirdos are doing and the 'community' truly spearheading practical applications will cease being weird.

Reread your comments dude, nothing about the way you approached any of my points was anything other than ad hominem. You even had good rebuttals about a few of my points (some of them were still really indirect or weak!), but because you approach what could be constructive discourse like an asshole, I'm more convinced than ever that 'bitcoin as a transactional medium' is a passing fad, and you're probably more convinced than ever that people like me are just being obstinent instead of open minded. 
Bitcoin with LN/L2 will never reach the critical network effect of demand required to be a functional transactional medium. Instead of calling me a fucking idiot, set a remind me. When in any time in life I'm required to use bitcoin instead of fiat, feel free to rub it in my face. When another crypto that can handle the volume and technical hurdles, or the fad dies, prices crash, and people stop developing POS systems and consumer facing software to handle transactions, I'll be sure to do the same. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 13:54:57
The 'collective' is predominantly made up of people who don't care, predominantly to the extent that a medium exchange for political purposes will never reach critical mass in the network effect of demand. 
-Western union is cheaper and faster for international wires, and will always outpace crypto 'currency' for this purpose. 
-Credit cards/banks already offer no fee for foreign transactions under de minimus amounts, it will always be cheaper and faster. 
There is still an argument to be made for the contracting company in Nigeria that needs to buy a tractor from john deere in the US but can't save because their currency is hyper-inflationary and they have no access to financial infrastructure. With that being said it's an incredibly small use case and becomes useless when the underlying medium of exchange is so volatile, even in a positive direction.

Idk if I would describe buying bitcoin and hodling as 'user growth' that's like getting a cd of 1,000 hours of free AOL internet and putting it in your cd player.

-Western Union/La Nacional/etc is not 'wire transfers'. If you show up to a western union with 1,000 in cash (like many day laborers do all the time), you can wire it for less than $5 immediately. There are use cases for international remittances, ripple has been remarkably successful at marketing that use case, but I don't think the network justifies a market value that rivals that of ford motor company but what do i know. 
-Bitcoin fees are less than $1 if you want to wait a week for them to process, if you want instantaneous transactions it has a real cost. 
-LN payments require you contributing essentially what amounts to an escrow balance like the OP described with watchtowers, they will not exist in any way that's practical unless there's a serious utility for a political use case, which there isn't.
-Merchant processing fees do exist, that's true, they average about 3%, but they are not built into the retail cost of goods in the 'short term'. (this isn't the place for an esoteric argument about retail price elasticity). Furthermore, no retail customer wants to pay $3 extra to buy something and no vendor wants to wait a week (at a $.10 mining fee) to receive funds in a transaction. 
-You have a shitty credit card, if you travel internationally and use your cc there isn't a fee for a majority of cards anymore (extremely common and now watered down marketing ploy to get you to change credit cards). The fee is implicit in their shitty exchange rate, but it's still not close to the costs/wait time for customers/merchants in using crypto at this time. 
-Who is increasingly *using* bitcoin? like as a currency not just buying and holding as a speculative buy? I believe that people in venezuala are putting their family fortunes into btc to hide it from the gov, I also believe they'll stop doing it as soon as bitcoin starts becoming more volatile to the downside than the upside, but I don't have any evidence to support my beliefs, and if you do I would thoroughly enjoy reading a scientific study that supports your suggestion that people are actually 'using' bitcoin. 
-Yes there is a use case for money laundering, evading sanctions, human trafficking, arms trading, etc. 
@_date: 2018-05-11 11:21:11
You're right, the only reason bitcoin isn't already the global transactional medium is because everyone is a fucking idiot and you're a fucking genius. When it never materializes as a transactional currency it'll be because there was some global conspiracy against your fucking genius not because nobody stopped to read your blog instead of jerking off and eating mcd's.

Really the most dissapointing aspect of their comments is that they can't differentiate between crypto'currency' and blockchain protocols that facilitate digital assets. Not that they don't understand but are intellectually lazy to get that silo'd economies that these other protocols can create, much like an autonomous utility. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 12:54:30
Cheers, and thank you.
Very simply, the reality is, when people use their credit cards they don't care if visa is centralized, when they use cash they don't care that fiat isn't backed by anything or that the fed can cause it to hyperinflate. 'People'/the collective just want porn, beer and Mcdonalds and they want it now. For this reason, bitcoin will not be successful, not to say other more ambitious digital asset custody management and utility blockchains won't be.

There's a lot of speculation about how futures could effect the price of bitcoin, but let's talk for a sec how futures/derivatives actually work.
In finance, derivatives are used as a hedge, typically against  exchange rate volatility. For example, Virgin America Airlines (a US Company) wants to buy an airbus a330 (french company) for 10 million euros to be delivered in 10 years. Virgin America isn't a currency speculator and they don't want anything to do with the risk that the dollar or euro plunge, so they enter into a futures contract to sell euros in 10 years. That way, if the dollar goes up, they save a little on the plane, but lose proportionally on the futures contract, or vice versa. 
In Bitcoin, or crypto, imagine the heavy machinery manufacturer (or buyer) in Nigeria who needs to rely on bitcoin instead of their domestic fiat because it's wildly unstable, it provides them an even greater opportunity to participate in the global financial system.

More fun to research and play with for now for sure, but keep in mind you're purely speculating on principal, there are no earnings that would traditionally drive value growth, or dividends that would pay you to wait for the appreciation.

So here's a very similar use case- An internal baggage handling system for airlines based on the blockchain instead of in a shared database (what exists now). Bags go missing, its expensive for airlines bc they have to pay claims, it also incentivizes a messy database so airlines can attempt to defer paying claims/liability by pointing to their own shit systems. A blockchain/tokenized system could potentially set up an incentive structure that has airlines being paid to deliver bags faster and quicker than their competitors. 
It would work something like this- Every time united airlines passes a bag to american airlines on behalf of a customer, southwest/delta/fronteir/jet blue/alaska, confirm that exchange via scan and stores that data. They are rewarded with a token, for storing and confirming that chain of custody. 
Details worth considering and discussing- Do customers have to buy and pay this token when they book intra airline flights? If an airline loses a bag do they have to pay a fee in tokens back into the network? Is the value of the token initially zero or pegged at an arbitrary amount? If an airline delivers a bag to the next airline, are they rewarded, or is the system only punitive if a bag goes missing?
All these questions and the initial setup are probably very similar to what a transit alliance is discussing. Nothing about this is about decentralization or is it some political statement about the 20th century montary system. It's about creating a shared incentive and goal structure that can manage itself autonomously to lower costs and create efficiencies. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 23:23:15
the blockchain in the transport alliance use case is not for using crypto as a payment mechanism but presumably for tracking intermediate goods, automating POs etc. Even if you used bitcoin as the base protocol for security purposes and built a second layer on top of it, all the centralization issues that you mentioned would still be a problem. Furthermore, I don't think bitcoin is even the most secure, cheapest or efficient base protocol to build this kind of shared transport alliance data on. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 02:26:40
you can't build a transit alliance blockchain on the bitcoin blockchain to be used as anything other than a payment ledger...because it has stalled. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 13:12:42
nobody cares about cargo data traded between railroads and logistics companies being trustless, decentralized, or paid for with some new kind of currency that serves an anarcho capitalist ideology. The point of then blockchain element is to improve efficiencies and costs by incentivizing third party participation in confirming and storing data, and to value that externally with the tradable token. 
Furthermore, nobody puts their trust in bitcoin for this purpose. Bitcoin is a ledger system for payments, there is a reason the ethereum alliance has far more participation from fortune 500 companies and business leaders developing use cases like this. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 17:40:03
Handle what things? Situations for what? What information?
If you don't see how private (or public) blockchains, either for use horizontally across industries or vertically through supply chains can create efficiencies (that's what the business world is excited about, including the transit alliance), you're not understanding the most pragmatic and near-term implementations of blockchain tech. 
If you think the only value is about trust and a political statement about our monetary system, and that somehow justifies a $500 billion market cap, I would sell and run very fast from this phenomenon. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 03:03:56
yea pretty much, except with a tokenized incentive structure that can be externally traded to value the data store. Do you really care that the information logistics companies and railroad companies share with each other when handing off cargo is 'decentralized' or 'trustless'? You may think you do but all you care about is that you receive your products quickly and cheaply, which is what I think this is aiming facilitate, a business solution.

Nothing 100 percent causes any bubble, but if there's anything that's one size fits all to blame for current equity valuations (which by the way, are not that high compared to historical P/E numbers) its monetary policy/QE for the last 10 years, not the fact that people aren't listening to fund managers' TA advice. 
The Buffett bet started in '07, the S&amp;P lost 50% of it's value over the next two years, the fund was actually winning for the first few years, but LONG TERM, one of the best funds and most competent managers on wall street could not beat something as simple as a broad based index fund. Some years some win some years other wins, but long term you're almost always going to lose (especially considering the fees and moral hazard associated with a managers fiduciary) I don't care how advanced your quants department is.
