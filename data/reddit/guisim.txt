I'm in Québec City.
- First 33 kWh are at 0.0582 CAD
- Rest is at 0.0892 CAD
It's the same prices throughout the province. The price does not vary depending on the time of the day.
Full details here: 


40.64¢ fixed charge for each day in the consumption
period, plus


product of 33 kilowatthours and the number of days in the consumption period, and

Is there a place where I can buy using a credit card from Canada? I'd love to drop Coinbase but the convenience is very high.

What does the price of a single coin mean? 
Market cap is a shitty metric but it's definitely more relevant than the price of an arbitrary size of the pie.

Another Québec Gold! ;)

I agree! But saying "it hasn't reached 1 dollar yet! It still has potential!" is as meaningless as any arbitrary value for any coin out there. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:26:13
The comparison with stocks is moot because you can't buy 0.0001 of a stock.
I could say "Bitcoin hasn't reached its full potential because of 1 bits hasn't reached 1 USD yet"
You can't do that with stocks.
My point was about the value of a coin and arbitrary "potential thresholds".

Pretty much everyone has a swimming pool here. Just figure out a way to warm it up during the summer :P
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:15:44
That would require a Québec governmental institution to be thinking ahead and innovating. 
They're not known for that.
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:06:53
I know people who do that.

Can't believe I had to scroll down this far to read about Monero.
Sadly, Bitcoins are not fungible. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:24:19
They don't own it. They can't control what I'm spending it on. Can't freeze it.
But I still want my free health care so I'm okay with taxes.

If you're in Canada, the CRA has an article on Cryptocurrencies and how to tax them.
TL;DR: If you buy something, it's considered Barter. If you sell for cash, you need to declare your capital gains.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:02:59
I hope you do not benefit from any governmental or municipal service with that attitude.

A series of tubes.

It's not a big truck! It's a series of tubes!

Marketcap is not perfect but IMO it's the best we have.

This is just dumb.

I think bitcoin would benefit from allowing some metadata to be attached to a transaction.
@_date: 2011-06-20 03:13:04
You are right, my bad.
@_date: 2011-05-23 15:43:01
Why would you want that ?
Do you think you will be sending money to people simply because of a witty Reddit comment ?
@_date: 2011-05-17 15:58:28
I'm curious, why ?
@_date: 2011-05-19 17:29:49
Can you make a version with this bitcoin image ?

1 000 000 computer bot-net ? I doubt that most bot-nets are that large.
@_date: 2011-05-20 02:59:26
This is the best one by far, imho.
@_date: 2011-05-24 11:39:47
Thanks for the link.
My point still stands, most botnets aren't that large. Only the top 5 are over 1M.

Everyone is hoarding... this can't be sane.

Newb question here : 
I'm mining using DiabloMiner on my desktop. It is pointing toward my Bitcoin wallet which is on my laptop.
The desktop isn't extremely powerful, I'm getting about 25 000 hash/sec.
What am I supposed to see if I successfully find a hash ? How much is this going to generate ? How often (on average) am I supposed to find a hash ?
Sorry if there is an obvious way to obtain this information.

Where is that "bonus for redditors" that you are talking about ?
is there a place on the website where I can specify my reddit user account or something ?

HTTP Referers aren't sent by most browsers when using SSL.

This one gets my final vote.

It's a great way to save your money from the CAD tanking :)

3000 CAD
