All they’re doing is sending out auto-generated letters to people based on 3-4 year old Coinbase information. IRS doesn’t actually have the manpower of expertise to audit Bitcoin users. This is just a form letter hoping people will voluntarily audit themselves.

The IRS is already terribly understaffed. Generally speaking, they’re mainly auditing people in the $250k and upward income group and people in the lowest income groups (engaging in welfare fraud). Most of the middle is almost entirely ignored. There are millions of people who don’t even file, and that number is growing (slightly) every year. There’s no way for them to catch up. 
Furthermore, there’s no particular Bitcoin expertise at IRS, so they’re not going after that first - other than sending a form letter based on Coinbase customer info and hoping to snag some low hanging fruit. 
The bulk of IRS efforts can be understood as seeking low hanging fruit - the lower, the better. If they put too much effort in for too little return, the IRS would end up costing more than it brings in (and there couldn’t possibly be enough manpower to do it anyways). 
Just my 2 sats.

Trezor is a preferable hardware wallet. 
Edge is a preferable phone based wallet.

Yes, nearly 12k is extremely cheap if Bitcoin goes to 120k (even if only within a decade). 10% annual average ROI is definitely a very solid return. 
However, it’ll probably be less time than that so, yes, Bitcoin is super cheap right now.

Bitcoin is still extremely cheap. ��‍♂️

You don’t need to buy a whole Bitcoin. The days of average Joes buying a whole Bitcoin every week are over. Be grateful that you can but 0.01 BTC weekly because, not too long from now, even that’s going to be far out of reach for the average person. 
There are only even 21 million Bitcoin available, so it’s actually a bit presumptuous to expect that you should easily be able to own whole coins now that adoption has been ramping up for a decade.

It’s simply keeping your savings in a deflationary rather than inflationary currency. (Which is the obvious choice, to be honest.)

Eh? The fact that the fixed supply of Bitcoin has not yet been fully mined does not make it inflationary. Having a known fixed supply and being impossible to replicate, Bitcoin less inflationary even than gold - which isn’t inflationary at all (and which is replicable by irradiation of platinum or mercury in a nuclear reactor and has an unknown supply). 
Technically speaking, anyways. The mining rate is not “inflation”, only mining.
