I have the Tails CD which uses tor, and I can use it without connecting, or the Ubuntu CD that I used to install my OS. So that's good advice.

Does the backup include the archived addresses as well as the active address?

Oh this is more like the answer a need. What is the difference between a WATCH ONLY account and a regular account? How can I convert my account to WATCH ONLY? Thanks sooooo much!

That is exactly what I was thinking. I guess, though, if I ever want to cash out, I am going to have to give some service my private key. It makes sense then to have multiple address. One that holds the bulk of the money, of which I only know the key, and a smaller wallet that has "spending" or "cashing out" money in it, and in which I am willing to release the private keys to a company in order to convert to cash. Am I right about this?

I use two factor ID and also I use Keepass to generate very long complex passwords. Hopefully my Keepass file is never hacked, that would be the end of me. 
What exactly happens if I backup the file and then, hypothetically, the next day blockchain.info is hacked? What's the worst that could happen if I have a wallet backup and an impossible password?

Thanks for this. I assume that I would have to make a new back-up after every transaction then? My concern was whether or not the backup actually transfers the complete wallet to my flash drive or whether it's just a copy that can still be accessed through the blockchain.info website. I mean, what's the point of a backup if all the original information is still being held on blockchain.info
