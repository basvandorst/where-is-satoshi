So its true this guy and others really do feel threatened by bitcoin? I in no way understand bitcoin like you do but I am starting to believe in it. I think I have a basic grasp of it.

I will remember this statement next time someone tries to do some bitcoin shaming. Bitcoin rarely comes up in conversation with me but when it does Im like *AHEM* and try to give a little insight even though Im no expert.

Im pretty ignorant but fascinated by bitcoin. Is this meme accurate?

Im not a bot if thats what you mean. I literally hardly know anything about bitcoin and am trying to learn and understand it all. The fascination part of it is how its such a threat to the monetary system we have now but I still have no clue how bitcoin actually works. I am befuddled by it all.

Oh I understand that however, you explained things in a way I can understand instead of like you said a bunch a bullshit. Take care.

Interesting point of view. Thank you for the feedback. Thats something I dont get either is if bitcoin is actual currency then why does it rise and fall in value like stocks do? Again I am clueless.

Ok wow, that was an explanation I can actually wrap my head around. Thank you for taking the time to write this for me. It makes more sense to me now.
