Miners, merchants, investors, traders, developers... every category of user has its own set of incentives. Every individual within these categories has their own subset, and some individuals are members of multiple categories. This is not just idle pontification: we now have multiple proposals, and multiple codebases, and the community is splitting into factions based on which they support: miners decorate their coinbases, developers take to twitter, CEOs blog heartfelt and content-free, and us simple HODLers rant on reddit and argue amongst ourselves.
Any change to the system rewards some, and punishes others. In such a climate, it may seem that progress has ground to a halt, since a step in any direction will land on somebody's toes, and their screams will echo forever on the consensus breaker's conscience.
Yet the system works. Maybe the meta-system, the system of reaching consensus about breaking consensus, is broken; but where's the urgency to break consensus? We've had weeklong transaction backlogs, and the system kept working. We'll have a monthlong backlog, if CoinWallet.eu make good on their bluster, and the system will keep working. Someday, when demand grows to fill capacity (a phenomenon far more certain than Moore's "Law", but yet without a name. How about "[Leeming's Law]( we'll have an indefinite transaction backlog, growing faster than block capacity, *no matter how far blocks are allowed to grow*.
Bitcoin will still work.

Or, one kind of crazy having to accept and deal with, the other.

I find it funny that entire new companies are springing up to consult about how to build blockchain derivatives, when any existing company could just have its CTO spend a few hours reading open source code, and build the rest in-house with any mildly talented programmers already on their payroll.

edit for clarity: Confidential Transactions is [totally different]( from "stealth addresses".
@_date: 2015-09-10 14:14:02
We're years away from Confidential Transactions on mainnet. It's cool technology but needs to be tested properly before deployment.

Except for the seventy comments about Andreas's book.

This one is problematic. It's quite good, but has many subtle errors which did not get corrected before it went to press. You can read the print book and stay on your toes to catch them, or just use one of the other resources recommended above. I liked the Princeton lectures, now on Coursera.

The exchange has [a fund for naked shorts]( against those companies and a couple others. You can buy the fund to short the companies, or buy [synthetic]( [assets]( sold by that fund to bet against the short, ie, long those companies.

The problem wasn't 5% of hash power using old rules transparently, it was &gt;25% using old rules while claiming to use new, by simply flipping a version bit. This is why soft forks should be triggered by compliance, rather than claims.
@_date: 2015-09-10 16:04:05
CoinJoin is also more expensive than regular transactions. You can pay that expense in time (waiting around for somebody else to join with you), or money (paying others a premium to join you), but either way you have to pay. It's not fair to make a more expensive option default.

Upon descent from the mountain, you saw that the people had melted down their bitcoins to cast a False Satoshi, whom they worshiped instead, and you smashed the tablets in anger.

Yes. Fungibility affects the whole economy, and is more important than protecting a single company from its own idiocy.

False dichotomy, the transaction volume could start increasing less steadily.
@_date: 2015-09-10 14:17:12
The price still reflect fundamentals, just ignore the two least-significant digits.
@_date: 2015-09-08 02:39:27
Why would they call the transaction type such a confusing name?
@_date: 2015-09-17 15:05:47
They should run a yield-generator with the hot wallet, and earn interest on it! As an added bonus, this way middle management won't know how to sendpayment on such a silly whim.

Look closely, nothing you disagree with was claimed in my post. You started with "No" but then went on to support in detail everything I said (We're in agreement on these issues).

Block size should be lowered to the point where eventual initial sync time levels off as constant versus hardware efficiency increases.
@_date: 2015-09-07 11:16:01
I thought the service of a coinbase was to pay the block reward to miners?

They begin with a 1 and have lots of garbage afterwards.

Then... turn it off. More profit for the rest of us.

Each input's priority is its size in satoshis multiplied by the number of confirmations. Add all the inputs' priorities, and divide by the transaction's total byte size. In other words, you get higher priority by having more coins and spending them less often.

My guess is that the eventual target audience for running makers are people who run a hot wallet anyways, such as exchanges. This is simply another way for them to increase their bottom line in a low-margin business.

If you want to protect your privacy, I recommend that you visit instead of using snake-oil centralized mixers.

No offense to VC shops, but it seems infinitely healthier than Elements Alpha or Ethereum Frontier.

@_date: 2015-10-02 02:59:52
The title is a bit misleading. Your coins don't become "private" after a single coinjoin, and your anonymity set wouldn't grow from repeated joins with the same liquidity.
However, for single-digit bitcoin amounts, you could do several joins, each with distinct makers, for roughly the same total price.

On the contrary, Bitcoin has to be more valuable to support a smaller block size's greater security.

LN channels are only unlocked when you close them. If you're just routing value across a couple channels, the block chain sees nothing.

How high would be the server expenses of running a joinmarket node?
How high would be the risk of hosting providers stealing your keys?

Yeah. It'd spark a scary new bubble as they tried to corner the market in preparation.

Old-timers on the lookout for promising bitcoin projects have similar or even larger amounts of bitcoin, just searching for an appropriate investment. The rudimentary UI indicates that development has focused on important issues, and demand can only go up.

You can use JoinMarket, it will eventually merge your dust but you can configure it to delay as long as possible before doing so.
