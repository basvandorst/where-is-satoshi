You stated "at all", totally false.
I'll agree that at it's current state the price is going a bit crazy. But you can't assume it's going to stay like this long term. And if it does, then you want to look at it percentage wise, which isn't as crazzy. 
As for transaction fee argument, with LN, it won't be as big of an issue.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:11:29
"that hasn't happened at all."
What reality are you living in thinking Bitcoin hasn't been used for goods and services?
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:54:50
How can it not be a currency if people are still willing to use it as one. Regardless the fact that it's a good idea or bad idea?
I get what you're saying that you're not tempted to use it as a currency, but that doesn't stop it from still being used as one. Sure it may be a bad idea at this current instance because of it's price going up. But if I'm selling something, I'll gladly accept bitcoin because I want more. 
It's still at it's infancy, so not many people will opt in to paying with bitcoin, but as adoption grows, the price will stabilize and people will be more willing to make purchases with it. 
That's the way I see it I guess.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:02:01
You're just wrong with that statement.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:06:02
At this point I would ask you to define what a currency is. I have a feeling Bitcoin would fall in that definition, if not it would be way closer to the definition of a stock.
What I'm trying to say is that it my not be by definition a currency, but it's much closer to a currency than it would be a stock. 
Store fronts wouldn't be accepting it as payment if it were a stock.
Edit: fixed a word

I agree he is a well known figure who understands those facets in addition to the technical points, but he is not the only one. He is very articulate and one of the best public speakers for Bitcoin. This puts him in the spotlight and with reason. I love the guy and I think he is the best at what he does. 
But all this doesn't me that "no one currently knows more about how Bitcoin works than" him
It's like saying, my favorite math teacher is proff X, therefore no one knows more than him. Terrible logic

I did contact last week about this problem and this was all the response I got:
"We are currently working on adding the Bitcoin payment as an option for our international customers. Unfortunately we do not have an ETA for this, but it is definitely being looked into. "
I don't see how hard it can be if it's already implemented on your site.
Edit: Ok I just saw a comment saying they use a different payment processor for International orders. Understood

That's why I never got an IPhone to begin with. It was easy to see the controlling philosophy Apple has. Lots of bitcoiners got turned on to Bitcoin by the idea that it frees you of the controlling banks and their outrageous fees. Why not do the same with your cellphone and get one that gives you more freedom.
I understand it's getting more popular and that not everyone get into bitcoin for the same ideals... but this is just hard to miss.

I was at my local scuba shop and asked the owner if ever she considered accepting Bitcoin, or if she ever heard of it. She said she heard of it but that she wouldn't accept it. She shot me down cold and I could tell she had no interest whatsoever. Then she went on to say she had a Facebook friend who would always post about it and that she blocked his posts.
I didn't push the subject because I could tell she had her mind made up and I was a bit in a rush. So I just told her if ever she decided to accept it that I would gladly buy gear from her with some of my Bitcoins.
I'm hoping in the future I can get a positive conversation with her where I can get her to open up on why she is against it. I'm sure they are misconceptions and I just have to wait till she is ready to hear me speak. I won't force it out of her. That would just throw her off some more.
But yes, I agree still lot of educating to do. The east coast in Canada is pretty bad. Looking at Coinmap, I only see 2 places in NS that accept Bitcoin, none in NB, PEI and NFLD.
I do know there was    going on a few days ago in NB but sadly I couldn't attend. I hope it went well.

A little less then a year ago I traveled to Germany and payed for a place to stay using Bitcoin on 9flats.com. I then went to the popular Room 77 and purchased a burger and beer for my girlfriend and I using Bitcoin.
Unfortunately in my area there aren't any local locations that accept Bitcoin. If I had the time and money I would start a business just to have something here that accepts Bitcoin.
Apart from that I haven't used it for much else. I'm waiting till overstock.com allows Bitcoin payments for people other then the US. I plan on buying patio furniture. I actually just sent an email to customer service asking about when they plan on doing it. And explaining that one of the beauties of Bitcoin is the fact that it's border-less. Waiting for the reply.

Too often, I hear friends tell me that obviously I'm a fan of Bitcoin because I've made some profit by adopting early. I try to explain that I'm more in it for the ideology and then I go on explaining it and it's advantages a bit compared to the current banking system and fiat currencies. They often end up less skeptic and end up understanding why I don't plan on converting my current holdings to CAD.

@_date: 2014-09-10 13:46:30
That's awesome. It's always fun to hear about someone who was full on against it slowly change their mind on it. 
I think that a lot of similar people just don't understand it so they quickly assume it's a scam, but as time goes and they see that it's not going away, their smart friends who understand it still haven't been burnt by it. They will slowly start to realize like your friend did. They will think "Hey, he did his research, I trust him. Maybe he's onto something."

I really don't like the fact that he says "Grown ups running the show"
I assume when he says grown ups is because he means people that are more experienced, know what they are doing and are smarter.
The bitcoin community is full of extremely smart and gifted individuals. Bitcoin is trying to fix problems that banks created. I don't think he understands these so called "grown ups" are the cause of these problems.
The MTGox argument is stupid and irrelevant.

stratication, collapse is very dicult to avoid and requires major policy changes, including major
reductions in inequality and population growth rates. Even in the absence of economic stratica-

and population can reach equilibrium if the per capita rate of depletion of nature is reduced to a
sustainable level, and if resources are distributed in a reasonably equitable fashion.

For 1 and 2, make sure you control the recipient newly created wallets. Then there is an important Step 3. 
3 Before you do anything else, wait for 6 confirmations on both transactions from step 1 and 2.
The danger of replay attack is that your first transaction (btc) will be valid on the second block chain (S2X). So someone could potentially take your transaction from btc mempool and broadcast it to s2x mempool.
Once step 3 is done, a replay attempt on step 1 and 2 should be invalid.
However, I'm in no way an expert, this is just based on my understanding of the replay attack. Please someone correct me if I'm wrong or missing anything. I will gladly make corrections.

Here would be my counter arguments.
1) Strength in numbers. Every new user that provides storage brings in their own capital to fund their own storage. Theoretically that can easily add up to more capital than Amazon. 
2) Rome wasn't built in one day I guess would sum up my counter. LN is already on mainnet so I wouldn't say it's just academic level at this point.
3) I think this is a good thing. It's being built in the wild while anyone can attack it. This makes it much more robust and secure.
4) I disagree here. When it comes to innovation the bitcoin dev team is at the top. Show me a board of directors and CEO's that are close to this amount of innovation and at the pace of bitcoin.
5) I would say it's a risk many people would be willing take to have full control of their money. There are tons people in the world that don't have a banking option like you do. So for them it would be either blockhain or cash.
6) I kind of agree with you on this one. I doubt we will see the legal system being replaced by blockchain. I think parts of the system will be replaced with smart contracts, based on if it's worth it. I guess my argument would be, it doesn't have to replace the legal system for it to be worth adopting.

Note: Talking out of my ass here
Probably because it's quick and easy money. It assures them the money will be spent in the store. And I imagine there is a good percentage of people who spend more then the gift card value and see it as "meh I'm paying alot less then I would have normally" so they probably make up for some loss this way. Also it can be a way to get someone to come back. Had a gift card, saw things they liked and couldn't afford it all on the one gift card, so they will be back later.
That's what I think anyways. Could be totally wrong.
Edit: You don't have these advantages by selling BTC cards. So you would have to sell with an markup to make your money.

In not sure you understand how contracts work. Until its singed by both parties, its still under negotiations. If the company would have sent a signed contract, he would have had to make the modifications on that copy, initial the changes and have the company initial those changes. The fact that they sent him something unsigned means it was a proposed contract. He just sent them a new proposition and they agreed to it without reading it. He never made an unauthorised change.

I understand it's easy to use and removes the trouble of carrying huge amounts of cash over borders, but criminals will always find ways with or without bitcoin.

I have only been using my wallet normally. Haven't done anything with paper wallets yet.
Edit: after reading [ I think that's what's happening. Follow up question. So if I want everything to nicely fit in one address I would just send my whole wallet value to a new address? This would allow me to eliminate change addresses?
