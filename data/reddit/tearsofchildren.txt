This isn't sports, I don't cheerlead for any currency. Go back to /btc
Bcash will never overtake BTC, if anything will it'll be ETH.
@_date: 2018-01-04 08:49:20
Huh? Coinbase/GDAX are the same, the price of BTC will always be higher on Coinbase + the fees you pay, that's how they make money.
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:22:52
I've spread out my buys so this doesn't really excite me because two of those buys were FOMO at 19k and 19.2k :/ I'm still in profit but not like HOLY SHIT profit. Lets break 20k so I can be excited.
@_date: 2018-01-04 08:55:44
For example, if you bought TRX on Binance 24 hours ago you would be up 100% profit, calculate that $450 x 99%. Total income would be = $895.50

Do you not even realize how much of a groupie you sound like? Roger is a criminal and doesn't give a fuck about you or Bitcoin, his only desire is money and manipulation.

I opened a Robinhood account and put some money in VYM, VOO, BRK.B, SPHD, Microsoft, and CVRR...after a month I've made $200 profit, most of that was from CVRR stock. My altcoins are giving me 200%-500% profit in a week. I understand the stability in stock and the huge volatility in crypto but I'm spoiled now.
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:23:27
Lot of stupid people in this particular post lol
@_date: 2018-01-07 09:53:03
Yep, for me it's way more exciting watching crypto gains than logging into my RH app and seeing I'm -$0.50 for the day, it's like...why did I put 5k into RH when I could've tripled that already in alt coins.
I'll start my IRA this tax season but then again, part of me doesn't want to because I could throw that $5500 into crypto and make ridiculous profit.
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:33:57
My asshole puckers up just a bit around 10k but other than that I don't give a shit.
I'd like to see some steady, slow upward movement though, these dips every other fucking day are annoying because it's obvious manipulation.
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:22:05
How is someone a noob for buying at 13k? BTC was sitting around 15k-17k for quite a while (in crypto time).
@_date: 2018-01-18 12:46:19
Unless those guys remove those sell walls, we might be chilling below 12k for a bit.
@_date: 2018-01-04 08:53:47
Put your $450 into GDAX, buy ETH, transfer ETH from GDAX to Binance.com, buy alt coins with ETH because that's where you will make money right now. You won't make any real money in BTC with $450 right now.
Then download the Delta app on your phone and input the coin(s) you bought and the price you bought at and it'll keep track of it for you.
@_date: 2018-01-06 02:16:52
Fear of missing out. BTC hit 20k and I thought it was going to break through and keep going but it didn't.
@_date: 2018-01-06 05:59:50
I bought at 8k, 10k, 12k, etc. Spread out buys.
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:51:57
Get comfortable with GDAX and use it. It took me 2 buys on Coinbase's website to learn quick and stop buying/selling there. I know they have to make money but you can't buy/sell at the exact coin price plus they tack on fees. Use GDAX and limit buy/sell.
@_date: 2017-12-31 06:59:23
I'm joking too. I gave you an upvote sir.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:23:01
Can't decide where to put a limit buy at. I'm trying to get the best price possible since I'm already in the red. It's either gonna be 12k or 10k.
There's a huge buy wall at 12k, I don't see sellers breaking through that easily do you?
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:06:02
Pricing differs across exchanges. Do you have a Coinbase account? If you do then go to GDAX and you can watch in real-time.
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:45:46
Oh I know, it's scary shit. That's why rule  is never invest more than you can afford to lose. It's cliche but it's words to live by when investing in anything.

Oh like the stock market crash? Or the housing bubble?

Need me a can of DIP asap.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:52:34
Well yea, we've all experienced that and that does fucking suck but to think Bitcoin is literally done and crashing for good and it'll never see 17.8k again is a bit shortsighted.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:10:49
And fuck the guy with 578 coins at 13.6k
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:54:24
Waiting on a GDAX bank transfer so tried to buy at the 15.8k dip on Coinbase and it wouldn't go through. Coinbase is an epic fucking fail every time.

BTC was at over 19k a day ago. If this is causing you immense anxiety and stress then sell and get out and never come back. If you can't handle it don't put money into it.

Just follow their Twitter  as they always post about website downtime. It's maintenance.

I got more at 17.8k, missed the 16.8k because Coinbase crashed and I have no USD in GDAX. Oh well.

There were 5000 (exaggeration) posts today on r/bitcoin about transaction times, back to back posts that were obviously from people over at /btc spreading fear.
I agree 100% that Bitcoin is slow and needs a solution and a solution is coming. Bitcoin is too big to not implement the solutions.

Maybe one day GDAX won't crash during a big sell off.

Possible but it's a hard sell, XRP did drop too, just not as much. KMD (Komodo) stayed up there as well in the green.
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:56:27
You keep your Coinbase account, just do all buy/sell/withdraw transactions through GDAX. You can withdraw from GDAX to your bank account or a wire transfer.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:25:14
My bank deposit hits GDAX right at 13.2k lol fuck...need more dips baby
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:25:52
I'm personally waiting to see what happens if it drops to 15.5k, it'll either shoot back up or continue down to 15k (or 14's) and then I'll buy.
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:21:11
So 17k seems to be the new low aye?
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:23:52
I bought at 8k, 10k, 13k, 15k, 17k, and my last 2 dumb ass purchases were at 19k cause I was drunk and tired LOL. Those 17k and 19k buys are what's destroying my gains right now, I'm -$811.09 with BTC. I'm holding though, fuck it.
edit: As I was typing this I'm now only -$599 in BTC. Lets hold boys.

Why are Trezor's $219 on Amazon? Pumping up the price because of the surge in buyers? Think I'll go with a Nano S
edit: I'll check out Trezor's website and buy from there if I decide to go with that one, both the Nano and Trezor's prices are jacked up on Amazon.
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:15:16
All it takes is a statement from the government to change things immediately lol. South Korea issued a statement and had the word "ban" in it, so mass panic ensued but all they're doing is putting more regulations on the market like no more anonymous accounts, etc.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:47:31
That's exactly what it is because it's not a correction.
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:40:13
It honestly shouldn't be that way, it's people's money and they can do whatever the fuck they want with it. Just because you "believe" in something doesn't mean the next person has to.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding you but how does someone know how to buy but not sell?
I's just as easy as buying, you click a button in Coinbase and withdraw to your bank account.

Oh I see now, you're talking shit to promote your shitty website, makes sense now.
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:05:17
South Korea issued a statement but it's just panic selling, someone saw the word "ban" and they all panicked. No ban will be put in place, just more regulations in S Korea.
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:09:19
To make money like that you would wait for a dip, go all in at the dip and then sell all of it when it goes higher and then HOPE for another dip and repeat the process. It's a risk.
For example, if I put $10,000 in at the 10.9k dip earlier today I would've sold right now at 11.6k, that's decent pocket change for the day.
I plan to hold but I also want to throw a couple grand in for this specific purpose just to earn fiat every day at least until it stabilizes (if it does). but then you have taxes and all that bullshit to keep up with so I haven't decided for sure if I want to do it.

@_date: 2017-12-18 01:31:33
It dipped a tiny bit from like 19.8k and I bought some at 19.2k and 19.3k, will buy more if it hits around 18k tonight.
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:39:30
I was just curious why it's that much on Amazon, it's shipped and sold by Amazon so I don't get why they jacked up the price. I get 2 day free shipping so I pretty much buy everything from there.
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:42:20
Could take 20 minutes or 13 hours. Next time use LTC, it's like 2-3 minutes. Then exchange LTC to BTC on Binance.

Nope, you can't cancel the transfer or do anything with it until it hits your Coinbase account.

From what I've read Roger Ver pushes BCH as the "better Bitcoin" because it has lower fees and faster transactions, but will Bitcoin be better once Segwit and Lightning Network are available on all exchanges? Will that make BCH pretty much worthless?
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:01:11
I'm in at 8.5k, 10k, 17k, 19.5k, etc. None of this matters if BTC hits 30k-40k+. Most important thing is don't put in what you can't afford to lose.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:37:56
Same. I was definitely not comfortable watching it shoot up to 20k like a rocket. Slow and steady is fine with me.
From what I've read Bitcoin has been through numerous attacks over the years and has always prevailed, and so far today it's done it again. I'm confident in the long term.
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:10:14
I do agree with you. My head isn't in the clouds, we're not going to turn the tides with crypto, 1% will stay the 1% but we are putting pressure on the system and that's a good thing. Of course, it can easily be turned against us though.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:16:53
Probably be auto sells set at 20k and then it'll drop like crazy but go right back up like it's been doing. The problem lately is that it goes back up so fucking fast you barely have time to buy at the dip or the market sites crash.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:18:43
Weekends don't count, expect it today or Monday.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:15:01
Let them sell, holders know it will go back up and buy at the dips. These are discounted coins.
I bought more at 17.7k and might buy here at 17.1k, waiting to see if it goes lower.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:31:28
GAME OVER MAN! GAME OVER!
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:57:36
Well the $1500 then should be back in his account, or whatever amount he had. He probably got an overdraft fee but he hasn't lost the money because if the transfer was cancelled it goes back in his bank account.
 Just contact Coinbase and they'll lift the suspension eventually, just explain you didn't have the proper amount of funds in your bank account and they cancelled the transfer.
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:22:39
I buy off and on, I got some at 13.9k over the weekend. Missed the 10's dip, still pissed about that.
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:32:07
I bought some at 15.4k and 15.5k. Waiting now before buying more. Dropping so fast.

"Korea is shutting down exchanges and restricted accounts"
They're just putting more regulations on the market like no more anonymous trading accounts, etc. It's really not that big of a deal but it caused a bit of a panic in S Korea.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:43:12

Use GDax, it's owned by Coinbase but no fees on limit orders and smaller fees on market orders.

Watch it rocket to 17.5k again
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:15:57
BCH was planned to be in withdrawal mode only by Jan 1st and trading of BCH would be determined at a later date. This was said on Coinbase's blog, and this  was on their website 5 days ago.
People are completely naive if they think this wasn't all planned. Pure manipulation.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:42:34
This was like 4 days ago.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:14:12
Coinbase is insured from hacks, plus they keep majority of coins offline in cold storage. The only way you lose your coins is if YOUR account gets hacked, which is possible.
If you put your coins in their vault there's a 2 day wait to transfer/send them out and you set up 2 e-mail addresses to confirm the transfer and Google Authenticator before the transfer even starts. And you're given numerous opportunities to cancel the transfer during the 2 days. So someone would have to hack your Coinbase account, hack both gmail accounts, and have physical access to your phone.
All that aside, after recent events with Coinbase I have lost a lot of my faith in them so I'll probably be moving to a hardware wallet soon.
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:35:06
Oh I know, I always use GDAX and was gonna chill out a bit and not buy anymore BTC for a few days and then today's dip happened and I couldn't buy lol, very frustrating.
I wish they would do how the Robinhood app does and bank transfers are immediately available, they basically front you the money until it clears.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:43:04
Tanking would refer to a constant fall, Bitcoin is dropping, jumping, drop, jump, etc. It went from 12.8k to almost 14k in seconds. Then back to the 13's.
Bottom will more than likely be 12k - 12.5k like Head said. Huge wall at 12.2k now.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:14:28

Man I can't even sleep properly anymore, I see the charts in my sleep, dreaming about dips, checking reddit and gdax first thing in the morning. I had a nightmare the other night that BTC did a major drop to 7k but I couldn't buy because the Buy button wouldn't work, I was frantically hitting the buy button and then woke up sweating.
Loving every minute of it though haha

GDAX usually works  fine, I just don't have any funds in it right now, waiting on a bank transfer. I was trying to do a quick credit card buy on Coinbase but of course their website sucks balls.
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:01:09
Site's just bogged down, it gives that error when a lot of action is going on at the GDAX site.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:36:44
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:00:25
Maybe transfer it from Coinbase to Binance and sell it there.
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:52:23
Even ETH is slow as fuck right now, usually ETH is 5 minutes to Binance from GDAX, currently at 2+ hours waiting on a transfer.
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:19:23
Gotcha, so you already have $1500 in Coinbase but you're temporarily suspended from accessing your account and that money/coins. E-mail them with all the details you can about the transfer and wait 
I'm sure you'll be fine, it says "temporary" so don't worry too much. I'd look into getting a hardware wallet like a Ledger Nano S to avoid this in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:07:58

My first buy was at 8.9k and I'm a little pissed I didn't just put everything I've put in so far at that low price. I was testing the waters and only did $200 but it was the smart thing to do.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:48:56
PM me, we can chat and discuss it. I might be willing to test a small amount, I just know fees are ridiculous right now so not sure it'll be worth it.

@_date: 2017-12-22 16:32:15
Your Bitcoin amount never changes, only the value of it. If it goes down to where your $0.00 in profit/loss and then goes back up, so will the value of your Bitcoin. So if Bitcoin goes back to 18k, you'll be in profit.
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:14:25

That's a tiny drop in the bucket when it comes to Bitcoin. We've seen 2k-3k dips just as quick many times and it climbs right back up even stronger. People see all those red numbers and the price plummet fast and it freaks them out. It's almost back to 18.7k right now.
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:48:04
People are stupid, this isn't something surprising. They don't want to learn or research anything, they want to throw money at it and see what happens, if it goes down $500 they panic and get out and call it a scam LOL
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:50:36
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:19:42
No one knows anything because this is new territory because of the mass media and social presence of Bitcoin lately, that's why it's skyrocketing. Literally anything can happen, it could climb to 50k easily or crash after 20k, no one knows.
You can't say it's not sustainable because it actually could be.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:09:31
Roger must be one HELL of a dick sucker to have Coinbase/GDAX and CNBC in his pocket, WOW. This is ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:33:25
Definitely, much more comfortable watching it slowly grow.
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:38:47
Yep, lot of buy orders kicked in when it hit below 14k. It's fun to watch.
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:34:35
Now that I'm looking into, it seems all that recent sell off was fear selling started by  on Twitter. I think I'll hold for now, worst case I lose $32 lol
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:48:41
I took a break this morning around 5 AM to watch some Netflix and a $600 dip happened, I was like are you fucking kidding me? I walk away for 5 minutes to relax and missed a dip.

USD wallet is insured by FDIC, it's as safe as a bank. If you keep your actual coins in a wallet, it's only insured if Coinbase gets hacked, but if YOUR account gets hacked then you're screwed.
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:20:01
Yea, I'm just gonna go to bed and see where it's at in the morning. Watching the chart most of the day wore me out mentally lol fun ride
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:43:46
I don't think there's any way around it because the price is different across most exchanges, you take the loss once transferred but gain it back in the altcoin profit.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:48:08
So you did a bank transfer to Coinbase for $1500 but there wasn't enough funds in your bank account so it was reversed/cancelled? I'm confused.
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:44:09
Just stop lol. Only at it 10 days? You shouldn't even be posting, you should be reading and learning.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:00:48
You know what, I just remember something. I did have a Coinbase account back in August, I used it to buy Depfile premium accounts so I bet I had like $4 bucks in BTC leftover and that's how I got the credit. So no, you won't get any BCH if you didn't have any BTC in August.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:53:47
Oh yea, I got in at $0.49 but wish I had bought more at that price, my second buy was a bit higher. I'm up $400 profit but wish I put more in on that first buy. I always end up screwing myself over by getting in at these low prices but not putting enough in to make some real money.
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:03:59
Same, waiting to see what happens at 20k
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:23:00
I've been waiting for Tier 3 approval for over a week now, I'm glad they took their time so I didn't deposit any money with them, I'm just going to close my account. Good luck with your issue.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:50:06
I did for some reason but I only got like $4.50 worth (which shows it's worth $20 now). I didn't have Bitcoin until November so not sure how I got BCH when they said you had to have BTC in August to get the fork.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:33:22
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:02:58
My problem with this guy is him pushing BCash as Bitcoin and misleading new users, plus the interviews, the inside trading, in bed with media and exchanges, and the blatant manipulation of the market. A market people have real money in and for some of those people, a crashing market that would cause financial damage to their lives.
If the fork is strong enough then it'll speak for itself. He just reeks of pure fucking evil to fill his pockets even more. It's not surprising though, every time money is involved there will always be guys like Roger Ver around.

It'll show up in your Coinbase account under "Accounts", just select the Wallet for the coin you sent and you'll see the transfer.
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:25:47
I use Ally Bank and so far no problems transferring money. It's online only though so if you need a brick &amp; mortar bank then it's not the bank for you.
Why don't you trust Coinbase? They're having site issues but it's because of growth, they gained 100k new subs over Thanksgiving, more by now. Plus your USD wallet on their website is FDIC insured. I haven't heard of these cash seizures? Got any links?
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:32:34
I don't go by review sites to be honest, pretty much every company gets shit reviews. Even my bank Ally on certain sites get bad reviews but I've never had one issue with them, same goes for PayPal and I've been with them since 1999.
I understand things do happen but it's probably 0.01% of users. 334 people out of millions, that's a tear drop in a barrel.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:28:48
Transfer to GDAX (owned by Coinbase) and trade there, never use Coinbase for buys unless you have to use a credit card for emergency buys.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:52:16
Mind sharing what alt coins you're trading? I'm looking at getting into alt coins myself, just trying to learn a bit about what people are diving into.

There's a little resistance at 14k but not even close to that 13.6k wall.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:12:22
It's back to 12.5k, hard to gauge though cause it could easily drop back down to 11k in seconds.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:13:14
Wow, they actually made a smart fucking decision for once.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:20:54
Lets see if we can crush this small 13k wall
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:57:24
I haven't cashed out anything yet so I can't give you any insight into that. I've had no issues with Coinbase when it comes to setting my account up, bank transfers, buying coins, etc. I'm not a vet, I got into this literally last month but I've read and researched a lot since then and I personally feel it's a secure/safe platform.
When you have millions of users, if 0.1% of those users have an issue, they're going to scream and shout and make it seem like everyone is having the same issue. It's the vocal minority. It happens with every company; PayPal, Bank Of America, Wells Fargo, etc. Go look at reviews of these websites and you'd be scared to death to deal with them lol, but more than likely you won't have any problems.
Some people have had issues with Coinbase with slow withdrawals and stuff but I blame that on the huge growth of the company, hundreds of thousands of new sign ups over a holiday weekend would put a temporary kink in any company. It's called growing pains. Follow their twitter  and blog 
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:29:48
15-16 does feel about right, now it's just hovering around 16k. If this is bottom then I'm very pleased after all the bullshit that's happened yesterday and today.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:14:42
This shit is starting to make me feel uncomfortable. Blasted through 15k like it was nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:09:50
Fucking 13.6k is holding strong, we need Moses to part that bitch wide open.
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:23:34
Think long-term man, we're in the infant stages.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:38:55
This isn't the first time this has happened. Big buyers are waiting for a secure bottom price and then they'll pump cash into it even faster than it's dropping.
And never invest an amount in anything that will make you sick and stressed if you lost it all, you're just setting yourself up for anxiety when something like this happens.
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:53:32
You're fine. I bought some at 15.5k and then it dropped to 13.9k. Now it's back up to 15.2k, this was all in like 10 minutes.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:15:24
Same. I'm not even worried and I don't know why to be honest. I've got 10k invested (this isn't chump change to me, I'm not rich) and I'm in the red but I truly feel BTC will bounce back and all will be fine in 2018.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:12:38

@_date: 2017-12-12 01:23:20
Seriously wtf
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:29:34
Keep on dropping boys so I can buy more, lets see 15's
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:38:08
Pretty sure I've seen it mentioned about 247 times in this thread alone that it's a scam fork and not going to happen.
edit: It will happen, didn't mean to put "not going to happen" but it's looked at as a scam by a lot of folks.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:59:09
You can transfer funds and coins between Coinbase and GDAX instantly and free. So if you had 5 BTC or $1000 in Coinbase, just go to GDAX and "Deposit" that from your Coinbase account, very simple.

On a serious note, look into getting into a few alt coins on Binance, you can purchase ETH on GDAX and then transfer (for free) to your Binance account and buy alt coins there.
@_date: 2018-08-11 19:03:57
Youre right. I'm starting to do this, I bought at $6080 this morning and it's already up 5%, just gonna set a limit sale at $7500-$8000 and rinse and repeat cause over the months it's been pretty consistent of falling, going up, falling, etc.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:35:50
Good for you bro, go jerk off in your stacks of cash. Why are you here?
@_date: 2018-08-29 04:04:18
I'm down -43% in BTC so I might as well make a little money back while the whales manipulate the market. Bought more BTC at $6080 and set a sell order at $7500, Just hope it hits $7500 before it dips again so it goes through :/ Hoping I can rinse/repeat a few times.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:58:55
"It appears that Park Nam Ho, also known as Daniel"
LOL fucking died at that sentence.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:53:38
Yea, wait time can be 2-4 days or 6 days. I'm waiting on a transfer too but I locked it in at $8900.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:45:51
Did you deposit it into your USD Wallet or buy bitcoin using a bank transfer? It locks in the rate when you buy the bitcoin with bank transfer. I'm waiting on mine too but I locked in at $9100 so once it hits Coinbase I'll get the current rate.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:55:26
I bought at 8900 lol kept refreshing Coinbase app like a fucking madman and it finally went through. Back up to almost 10.1k
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:36:18
My question, is it possible that it can go from $10,300 to 0 within hours/days? I'm a noob investor so I'm not sure if it can crash extremely fast or would it be a slow burn, like dip to 8k, then 6k, 5k, etc. over days?
fucking shit, just hit $10,400.
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:55:23
Coinbase is good for beginners, it's simple and easy. You start explaining to new people about private keys and having to keep track of everything on hard drives and all that shit and most won't bother with it.
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:01:42
I look at my purchase history on Coinbase and I would use bitcoin to buy a Depfile premium account here and there. $200 a coin back then and I had no idea. I had the chance and the money to invest...I'd have 20+ million right now :(
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:54:24
I figure a mass panic-sell would have to happen for it to drop significantly. I don't see that happening unless the government bans bitcoin tomorrow or something even crazier happens right?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:56:24
Relax bud, it's already back up to 10,200
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:38:12
And it just dropped from 10,800 to 10,500 in a second, jesus christ this is stressing me out lol
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:03:28
It's moving rapidly and all over the place, just relax and hold. I'm stressed too cause I bought more at 10.5k but fuck it
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:44:41
Got in at the dip at 8.9k, thought it didn't go through but it did. Coinbase needs to get their shit together immediately.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:38:01
If you buy the actually Bitcoin with a bank transfer it'll lock in the price, if you deposit from your bank account to your "USD wallet" then it won't lock in the price, all that does it transfer funds from your bank account to your Coinbase account so you can then buy Bitcoin. So be sure you buy Bitcoin through a bank transfer so it locks in the rate.
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:26:25
Instant with a CC but mine is limited to $100 a week. I guess because I haven't bought a lot of bitcoin yet. It says I need to wait 60 days to increase my limit?! I don't understand their process, I've verified my identity.
Bank transfer is taking 6 days but I locked in around $8500.
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:53:00
I saw the knife and my balls started hurting and I clicked out, I don't even wanna attempt watching this in case it's actually real lol

@_date: 2017-11-27 02:49:27
I'm not too worried about PayPal, I've been with them since 1999 and have pushed a whole lot of money through the site over 18 years with my online business. Never had one single issue with them. I've read the horror stories though.
But yea, if we're talking millions I could definitely see some issues coming up. I'm not worried about that right now, I'm just starting with Bitcoin cause my dumb ass blew it off as a joke when it was $1 a coin.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:43:51
After 100 refreshes I bought some at that $8900 dip, first buy didn't go through but the next one did.
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:14:30
Yea, I bought at $8900 and felt that was high as hell and now at $9700 I'm hesitant to buy more. I really want to throw 2k-3k in this week but fuck, I'm scared. Even if I lost the few grand it wouldn't hurt me financially, it's just having the balls to do it.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:46:36
My gripe is the lack of communication. You don't say you'll be down for 1-2 hours and then not communicate to your customers for 7 hours. It make people lose faith in your company. I'm all for upgrading systems for stability but please COMMUNICATE.
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:21:02
Are you saying if I have an account with Coinbase and set up a weekly max withdrawal to my PayPal account, I'll run into problems?

I just kept refreshing the app, website didn't work at all for me. First buy didn't go through and I kept refreshing and my next buy did, but it looked like it didn't go through, then the amount showed up after 30 seconds.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:05:02
I check for dips but if OP didn't know, you can set up alerts in Coinbase (if that's what you use) so you get a push notification when it hits a certain price.
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:14:41
Then buy more and continue to hold?
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:35:37
Thanks for the info. I just need to take a full day and dig in and read all I can. I bought $100 through my credit card and then $400 through my bank (damn 6 day wait) at $8500 and I'm assuming the main issue with leaving bitcoins in Coinbase is that they can be hacked, shut down, take your bitcoin for no reason, etc. So moving your bitcoin to a private wallet is mainly for security/protection purposes right?
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:31:54
At $200 a coin I was buying enough bitcoin to buy a premium Depfile account for a month every now and then to download porn. How stupid do you think I feel? lol
Had no fucking clue what bitcoin even was, Depfile wouldn't accept my CC so I used Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-26 11:58:03
This is what confuses me too. I bought $500.00 worth of bitcoin through my Coinbase account, so now it's in my "BTC Wallet", is it ok to keep it in that wallet? I see the "Vault" option but I haven't configured it yet.
Coinbase also offers PayPal for withdrawals, so if I ever want to withdrawal my bitcoins to cash, I can do it that way?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:27:54
Error on Coinbase when I tried to buy at the dip, fuckkkkk
@_date: 2018-11-15 16:40:06
My fuck up was with alt coins like XLM, NEO, ICX, etc. I averaged down in BTC so I'm only down -$6000 total but alt coins fucked me with no lube. And I doubt the coins I have will ever recover. I don't even worry about it anymore tho, just hold for years and see what happens.
@_date: 2018-11-20 00:33:48
Yea, I'm not selling at a loss so all I can do is hold and wait, being down -95% in Icon though is laughable lol. I just FOMO'd so hard back then.
@_date: 2018-11-20 00:36:05
Yea not sure, Stellar possibly not, they've got a lot going on right now.
@_date: 2018-11-20 04:48:15
My first couple of buys of Stellar at $0.20 are still green but my $0.60-$0.70 purchases fucked that all up.
@_date: 2018-11-20 00:27:47
I'm down -59% in BTC and I'm not really worried but it's the fucking alt coins I bought that fucked me hard, I think that money's gone for good. Icon, Neo, Stellar...will these ever go back up?

They're required by law to send out tax forms if you make a certain amount. PayPal, Stripe, Amazon, Google, Robinhood, and every other website that you sell or make money on have to do the exact same thing.  
 
How old are you? Welcome to shitty adulthood and paying taxes.
@_date: 2018-02-15 20:06:03
PayPal is like $20,000 per year or X number of transactions and then they report it directly to the IRS, I guess websites have different thresholds. Coinbase does the minimum unfortunately, $600-$650.
