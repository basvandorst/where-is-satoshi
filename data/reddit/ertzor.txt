try some meditation or maybe reading some good books before bed. This works wonders for me.

I'm dutch as well, and have always been a client of the Rabobank. After they pulled this I will switch to another bank and tell them why!

Ah awesome it finally worked and is secured again. I thought it was enough if you just entered the security code when prompted while sending. 
Thanks and I hope you guys are enjoying this bitcoin stuff as much as I am. :)

If you look at that chart, you can clearly see that in the start of 2013 the price was much lower than after the april bubble. If the same type of scenario repeats itself with this bubble, we will still come out on top. 
And on top of that, this time around there is a lot more confidence in bitcoin. The upward buying pressure during the corrections is still very strong, it seems people are more afraid to miss out than to lose money. Back in april it was still a shady internet money for illegal stuff. There definitely is a good chance that there will be more corrections/even a crash, but with all the innovations and media attention bitcoin's price will keep growing. 
It's only the beginning. Soon we will have bitcoin hardware wallets, making it both safer and easier for the general public to get involved. A business like bitpay can also help greatly in getting more businesses to accept bitcoin. 
As the userbase and trust in bitcoin grow, the price will become less volatile.

Andreas antonopoulos also has some good stuff on youtube and the internet about the future of bitcoin.
