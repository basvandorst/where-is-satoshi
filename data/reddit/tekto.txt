He just took the technique which survived. Why not compare Bitcoin to NetBIOS/SMB? Or even Novell Netware? They had (only) one purpose and were eventually superseded by all those TCP/IP-Services we use today. What if we see another blockchain to be this in the end?
The Question is: Will Bitcoin be so flexible to extend in the future? Regarding the current disputes I really doubt that.

I hope so. And I hope they'll do it wisely. "We" have learned, that it makes no difference to buy in "our" home countries. So if it'd be too expensive to buy there, go to Japan, e.g.. ;-)
Instead, I assume the will offer buyer/seller protection as an escrow intermediate for bitcoin as well, which IS a feature many people are missing. And in some way "they" will have to pay for such insurance.

First, contrary to the article, there is no VAT-exempt in germay on bitcoin. Quite the contrary, it IS subjected to VAT taxation. Second bitcoin is considert a 'digital good' and as such it will be taxable in the country it is 'consumend', e.g. where the customer resides. (Before 2014 it was taxable where the business selling it is located) So, for now, all non-spanish residents will have to pay VAT at possible exchanges as if they would have bought bitcoins in thier countries.
