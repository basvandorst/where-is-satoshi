Im pro solar. 
Why cant bit coin be generated by buying solar panels and selling electricity for bitcoin. You get bitcoin for providing electricty to others. That seems to make more sense to me

Oh for sure, make no mistake i loath the banking system. 
Typing a few zeros into a computer screen to create value is a joke.

Thanks for reply. 
I just see these warehouses full of machines running 24/7 stacked to the roof with huge fans cooling them. 
The owner talking about how he makes millions a year from it. And i just look at it and think wow, the planet would be better off if he just shut the BTC factory down. He is just using alot of electricity to create personal wealth.

Im not sure i understand your point unless you are just trying to correct my grammar.
I thought morals refer to an individual's own principles regarding right and wrong. While ethics are dependent on others for definition.
Regardless everyone i have talked to about bitcoin tells me (not always directly) that the reason they participate is to create wealth (greed) and to take control of currency back off the bankers and government (power)

But i dont believe i could fraudulently create lots of electricity?
I guess almost everything can be hacked but i can keep track of my solar panels output and the recipient would confirm delivery of electricity.
What makes bitcoin more secure than trading any physical resource?

we killed trees to print paper money because we didnt have the electronic infrastructure in place for digital currency. I imagine in x amount of years there will be no physical money. 
Gold has many uses not related to currency or barter.
Air...i think you can work that one out

ill admit i dont really know too much about bitcoin, i just had a discussion with a mate who wanted to buy a miner or 2 but he was worried about the amount of electricity he would need to buy in order to make $ with bitcoin (which he intended to trade for our national currency so he could spend it)
I questioned why didnt he just buy solar panels and he might actually realize higher return per $ invested. Plus solar panels would increase the value of his home while BTC machines would cause heat and noise and be a pain. These BTC machines arent cheap either. But we never got to the checking the actual math. 
But best case scenario he was talking about months just to recoup his initial spend.

I guess it is converted into heat which then dissipates 
@_date: 2017-08-08 08:47:59
Because i have used electricity everyday since i was born, but have managed fine without bitcoin. Electricity is infinitely more valuable to most of the world than an additional currency. As the old adage goes, you cant eat money. Electricity can keep your fridge cold and your house warm.

[All this has to run 24/7 just to secure the network?](
That seems terribly inefficient
@_date: 2017-08-08 10:09:38
What can you do with it except to use it to barter for things that are actually useful, like electricty, water, food etc
@_date: 2017-08-08 10:00:34
I think the majority of people in this sub-reddit use bitcoin as stock to trade. Not as a currency. Its just about personal wealth creation
@_date: 2017-08-08 08:53:21
In this case i guess fossil fuels are converted to electricity which are then converted to heat, with bitcoin creating occuring during heat creation.

I do understand how it works as a stock for speculation, Im sure lots of people trade bitcoins without ever creating one.
1. yes, you certainly dont want to burn money, that can get you in alot of trouble.
2. I dont understand what you mean by ''attacking bitcoin'' could you rephrase that?
3.  Not sure access to electricity is fairly distributed. It seems very biased towards rich 1st world countries with good infrastructure. Quite of a large portion of the world does not have dependable access to electricity
