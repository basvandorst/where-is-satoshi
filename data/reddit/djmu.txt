One bitcoin = 25 kg of gold??  BTC to the moon for sure. Otherwise what is your point?

Sorry nobody is going to personally try to convince you of Bitcoin's merits. The question you posed has been asked thousands of times.  The fact it's still being asked is grossly ignorant on your part, hence original responder's do your own research comment instead of spoonfeeding you the answer to your tired old question.

Guarding 25k of gold is not the same as guarding one btc. Once again you make no sense in your post or response.

It is you that has it backwards, lets say a car costs $3600 dollars, I spend 1 btc on the car today.  Tomorrow btc goes to a million dollars a coin, the car now costs .001 btc.  How is that relatively cheaper if I've already spent the btc?  OP's point is with an appreciating asset, it discourages spending.

I understand what you are saying but you don't seem to understand that when you spend the bitcoin, you DON'T have it anymore.  So why would I spend 1 btc today when I can spend .001 btc tomorrow to get the same thing?  Deflationary currencies encourage you to save and not spend.

crappy videos?  Have you ever watched Krown?  To me it seems like he actually knows what he's talking about.  Why do you not like his videos?

That sounds like something Satoshi would say

It means in traditional spheres, 18% in 30 days would be non-organic, but for crypto it can do this and still be considered organic.

The best way is to keep holding.

The guy is telling us to be cautious and not get ahead of ourselves, so he has to be a 20k bagholder?
