A police officer does not have the right to open your car door, with two notable exceptions.
1. If you have given permission for the officer to search your car.
2. If he is in the process of making an arrest (of you) for some other reason.
What should have happened is the officer should have stood there, asked them to roll down the window (because he was having difficulty hearing them), and when they failed to comply he should have arrested them. That would have been legal.

Except for the part where people spam dust transactions of 1 satoshi in order to see which wallets are active and collect the dust into certain accounts.

This is an obvious scam. Do not donate money to these fraudsters.
If they had an actually scientifically viable way to generate net-positive energy from a fusion reactor, they could publish a scientific paper on it. That paper alone would get them multi-million dollars worth of funding.
They have no real science behind it, and it won't generate net positive energy returns.
I repeat, this is a scam. Stop being a gullible sheep and look critically at what they are proposing. Science doesn't care what your "belief" is, and their science is flawed.
This falls under the same category of junk science as perpetual motion machines, or solar roads, or mind-reading-headbands. All of which are the same "we don't want to show you the real science, just trust us" scam.

It also prevents cases where you say on your taxes
"I donated 100k to the Wikimedia foundation"

Without that transparency, you could just say you did that and send the money overseas in a briefcase (or similar), and the IRS would have no way to tell.

Insider trading really is a crime. If I work at a company and see that they're about to buy out a really small company, it should be illegal for me to buy out all the stock of that small company in order to jack up the price for my employer. As the employer it makes you distrustful of your own employees and sabotage from the inside, which is extremely counterproductive.
If you make insider trading legal, then you will get all sorts of wacky corporate espionage and bribing insiders for information (more so than already goes on).

He made the announcement, and immediately following it, Netflix "and" Amazon both started talking about it.
Netflix may not be competitor, but Amazon 100% is their main competition (and walmart.com, if you're going by volume). So he did the smart thing and started to accept it way ahead of schedule so Amazon would not have time to beat him to making the announcement.
Now overstock is getting a ton of free sales ( reason) and a ton of good publicity ( reason) and gets overstock.com seen as a high-tech company ( reason), basically for implementing a bitpay variant (so almost free). He wins out financially, and morally (because he hates the fiat banking system), and his company looks more "advanced and with the times" than Amazon.

Add to that the fact that they cut employee headcount when revenues are up, and recently reduced their investment in technological solutions. My own job was a way for my boss to do an end-run around the fact that the department had it's development budget slashed to near-zero.

ELI5: The reason nobody is buying on gox and selling on bitstamp is that people cannot remove bitcoins from gox at the moment. If you buy on gox, you're stuck there till this mess is over, and gox may or may not be bankrupt, nobody knows, which is why the price on gox is so low (people selling bitcoin on gox and keeping their money as fiat-currency to ensure they get paid back if the company declares bankruptcy).
I have 5 figures (usd) on Bitstamp, but would not touch mtgox with a 10ft pole. So that tells you my confidence in the two platforms.
I would personally say that you will find a better bitcoin price later after the gox disaster, but it takes time to get money to an exchange to buy coins.
When you do enter the bitcoin market, you may want to buy your coins on Coinbase, and then transfer them to a Bitstamp account if you intend to do day trading. That is easier than sending a several-thousand-dollar transaction overseas if you are in the USA. You can always transfer the coins back from bitstamp or your own wallet whenever you'd like afterall. Start the verification process now with both though, because it can take a few days (they're just trying to make sure you're not a Colombian drug lord or something).

It's just "faster" with a coinbase account. Because coinbase can do zero-confirmation trades (since it is all inter-coinbase anyway, the only way that a doublespend could happen is if coinbase did it to itself).

Think about it like this:
Take out your wallet, write a  on it. If you want to move bitcoin, you have to put a transaction on the blockchain that says "wallet  sends 0.05btc to wallet  (which is the other guy's wallet)". But the blockchain also stores where your wallet  got that 0.05btc to spend. If you "know" that the wallet you got that 0.05btc from is a mtgox wallet, you can reasonably assume that you purchased coins from mtgox. And you also now know one of the wallets that mtgox used, and can track what other wallets it is sending money to.
So, at no point does anyone have "your name", but they know that "someone" moved coins out of mtgox, because they know mtgox's wallet.

A corporation exists in order to do one thing, perform a task in order to generate a profit. Your local coffee corporation provides you with coffee to generate profit, that is their  and only real goal.
In a normal corporation, there are people running things. Someone who goes out and hires people to sell you coffee (management), someone who buys land and talks to the contractors that build new coffee shops, someone who makes new advertisements to sell you more coffee.
In a DAC, all of the tasks above are done by a computer. The computer has a way of hiring/retaining employees, of building more shops to sell coffee when there is more demand for coffee, and taking care of other management tasks. The DAC also has to have a way of verifying that you actually did do that thing it is going to pay you for.

As someone who worked at Visa's HQ, I'd like to say that the chance that Visa will move all their data centers to Russia is 0%. Credit card usage in Russia is very low for such a developed nation. Why would you abandon 80% of your revenue for a country that represents 5% or less? Aside from that, pretty much all of Visa's upper leadership is US based, their HQ is in the US, and they were founded as a US company.
The big centers for card-usage are:
1. China
2. USA
3. Western Europe
4. Brazil

I am not a lawyer, but: In my first ever "But this is good news!" post, this is actually good news. Having this video evidence means that any "new" judge who comes in to rule on this case can be appealed really successfully and have pretty much any judgement on Sean's Outpost overruled in a higher court. Assuming the higher court is not as corrupt as this Board.

Usually not. Remember that credit card fraud is handled very differently than account fraud.
When a company reimburses a person for credit card fraud, they are actually getting this money from the point-of-sale where the fraud happened (or the bank that "acquired" this merchant into the credit card system). They may say they are being nice to the client, and act like they are eating the costs, but they are actually on the line for 0 dollars (besides the hassle of their own time spent).

I think your idea lacks merit due to your failure to perform basic math.
Let's look at that USB miner. It claims 335 MH/sec, and let's assume it works that fast.
That makes it 0.335 GH/sec, or 0.000335 TH/sec. Current difficulty is 10,000 TH/sec.
If one in a hundred people in the USA (313.3 million) bought one of these USB miners and plugged them in, you would have a pool that amounts to a total of 1,172 TH/sec, which is ~12% of the current hashing power. But act quick, because it'll only be 12% of the hashing power for the next few months.
So if you can mobilize an entire nation to buy USB sticks, leave them in their computers at all times, and configure them correctly, then you might have an idea that would work for the next few months before everyone would have to buy a 2nd USB stick in order to keep it working for another few weeks.
Math trumps "feelz". Just because you "feel" that a crowd of small miners is equivalent to one big mining operation, doesn't make it true.

His criticisms are valid. 
1. Contrary to a lot of bitcoin's founding beliefs, regulation was always going to happen when bitcoin gets full market acceptance.
2. It is a bit amateurish of Mt Gox to keep their old name. They really should have transitioned to a more professional name when their volume became a multi-million-dollar-a-day affair. Coinbase was doing it right with a name that sounds professional, as well as Bitstamp (though I admit to bias), because both are easy to pronounce and give you an instant idea that they dela in bitcoin. BTC-e is hard to actually-say, as is btc-china. 
3. I've heard about escrow and delivery verification being part of the bitcoin protocol that isn't fully implemented yet. And this would be a great thing for bitcoin to have in major exchanges.
4. The identity-opt-ins option is actually pretty doable. If one uses a banking site that handles your bitcoin holding (or at least works as a middle-man online wallet) it would be pretty easy to use it to verify identity of the bitcoin holder if you wanted to.

There is a local farmer's market where the farmers sell apples for 5$, where people buy and sell apples all day. 
If a wealthy investor comes along looking to buy into apples, and he buys an entire shipment of apples in zimbabwe, how does that affect the price of apples in the farmers market?
The answer is that it doesn't, other than "not affecting it in the future". Because the sale does not happen on the exchange, it does not affect the price on the exchange at all.

Sample size is exactly 847. The polling-size is 18000. This was conducted using [Simple Random Sampling]( which only counts active respondents, not the whole population.
If I sent a survey to every living human in the world, and I got 5 responses, that does not make my sample size 7 billion. It makes my sample size 5.

Let me talk you out of your no 2FA stance:
Recently, I received an email from a trusted financial adviser. I was out of the house at the time, so I clicked the link from my phone. This signed me into a trap website, which captured my login info that was passed to it from my phone. Then then proceeded to use my email account access to attempt to transfer a lot of funds out of my account by impersonating me to my other investment firms. They had a bot set up that scraped the emails, edited them to delete the contents, and moved them to trash/spam before my phone got confirmation of it. All of this was done in the time it took for me to click a link on my phone, attend a funeral, and get on a plane back home.
If my financial adviser hadn't called me to ask if I wanted "this transfer expedited" I'd have lost a lot money and had literally nothing I could do about it.
While this example happened with traditional currency, it could just as easily have happened with bitcoin accounts on exchanges.
With a hardened password, all it takes is one offhanded mistake and poof goes your funds. With 2FA, they have to steal a physical device to actually get access, reducing your exposure a thousandfold.

Agreed. Instant was a big deal for me when I first got into bitcoin, and without it I don't think I would have moved (though various transactions) hundreds of bitcoin though Coinbase.
The low (10 was too low for me) limits on instant are why I decided to move to bitstamp once I was comfortable with bitcoin transactions. Also the 50 bitcoin sell limit is pretty dangerous when you have a 100+ bitcoin and you want to sell out before a major crash happens. Which means coinbase collects significantly less fees from me.

1. Writing styles: Dorian wrote to a railroad enthusiast magazine in broken English. Satoshi writes English very well.
2. Ability: Dorian doesn't have any of the background required. If he was actually skilled enough to produce the programming required for version 0.1 of the blockchain, he'd certainly be working much higher level jobs than he had been. Its equivalent to someone with the capability of working a 6 figure job, choosing to work for minimum wage.
3. Time &amp; Money: Dorian has been battling health issues and working as a poll taker and part time teacher. If he was in such dire straits, why hasn't he dipped into any of the bitcoin he generated early in the project's lifetime?

Analogy time (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong)
Think about it like this: 
You have a huge line of school-lockers, made of clear material. Off to your left, there are a huge number of them with a iron-block-lock (with no keyhole) on them, and each one is stuffed with notes (old transactions). You can read the note, but you can't actually change the note. This is how the "history" of the blockchain looks.
Off to your right, the line of school-lockers extends off into the distance as well (also clear). Inside each is a stack of 50 bitcoin. The trick is, each locker is locked with a padlock. The padlock has a really long and complicated combination, and lots of people are standing around trying to figure out the combination. The first person who guesses the combination gets to open the locker and take out the bitcoins. They also can take "notes" from the people standing around (bitcoin transactions), and for a fee (this is the small 5-10cent bitcoin transaction fee) will place their notes into the locker.  If someone didn't attach a fee, or not enough of a fee, they can chose to not put the note in the locker. Then once they put the notes into the locker, they put one of those solid un-removeable locks on it, and everyone moves to the next locker.

You've misinterpreted me. The prisoner's dilemma is not between users and hackers. It is between hackers and other hackers. Assuming the hackers currently hold 0 BTC.
If hacker A steals money now, it'll be worth a lot later if hacker B does NOT steal money now. If both of them steal money now, it is worth a lot less in the future (those both failure-states). If they both do NOT steal money now, there will be a lot more money to steal in the future.
Since the different hackers cannot all talk to eachother, there is effectively no communication.
You are correct in that it does not make sense for someone who holds a large volume of BTC to try to steal more BTC. Unless they are on bitfinex and are short-selling bitcoin. In which case it becomes fantastically profitable to steal bitcoin in the most damaging-to-the-community way possible.

I followed bitcoin for a while, but here is what finally hammered it home for me.
I was working for VISA, and we had a all-staff meeting between our various working groups. In this meeting there was a ~5 hour seminar on the basics of how the company works, just to get everyone on the same page. They detailed exactly how credit card transactions work and the basics of the banking system behind it. They even had a snazzy animation on how a card transaction goes across the globe in seconds. Except I realized that the transaction doesn't really do that, it takes days for banks to settle and for funds to really move.
Also I've had my credit card compromised a fair amount. At least 2-3 times I've had it stolen from hacked CC readers at gas stations, or from website breaches. With bitcoin I don't have to worry about that. But that's more of a "plus" than "the realization".
Side note: I'm now working for a payments startup and I'll be doing their bitcoin integration. It's going pretty well so far. NDA and all, but I'll be sure to make a post here when we've got a product ready and our bitcoin integration online.

So, by implementing bitcoin, overstock just increased its sales by 4.1%. Though that probably equates to a roughly 7-8% increase in revenue due to the lower transaction fees (and their thin margins). Assuming that every day people buy 125k worth of goods on overstock.com.

If he steals everyone's money by taking his service offline, what can anyone do? The service is already offline. By the time the new service is online, sure people could try to hack in. But what do they gain? Hacking access isn't easy, and often has no payoff if the destination has no valuable data. It's often very hard to turn a compromised system into profit. And even if you did that, why target him if you're skilled enough?
Even if you were skilled enough "and" he had something worth stealing, it's unlikely you would have a reason to hack him over any other target. Someone with intelligence would have never done business with him to begin with. He preys on the least intelligent and most trusting people.

You are a fool for falling for this bait and switch.
The government brought those charges to deny him bail and get him a harsher sentence in the end. The charges have gone silent for 6 months, meaning that they will never be brought.

@_date: 2015-09-02 02:31:05
I fail to see how your logic follows. If anything, it just shows that they dropped the charges because they knew that even with an admission they couldn't convict on them.
1. Murder-for-hire charges are used in the pre-trial process.
2. Ross admits to hiring a DEA agent to kill a DEA agent (himself).
3. The murder-for-hire charges are dropped when the real trial happens.
If the above is untrue, break it down for me. How does his admission of guilt change the way that the charges were brought against him?

A smart contract isn't "run" by a computer controlled by any one person. It's run on a machine that is transparent about its coding and does its own evaluation of the completion of the contract.
Sort of like setting up a robot to do it for you, and making the robot open source and giving a real-time feed of the robots brain.

There's documentation on how tokenization works and the best practices involved:
I'm sure that there are several people at Apple, Visa, and MC that all work to verify that the security is functioning. I know, because I've worked at Visa corporate, and currently work for a company that does secondary payment processing. It is unlikely that they would ever publish the actual security audit in a public form.
Visa might be cumbersome and poorly managed, but they do their due diligence when it comes to implementation.
@_date: 2015-03-10 18:48:43
You still have no idea how payments work. Apple never receives your credit card number. It's passed encrypted directly to visa/mc, which sends them the token. If they've built their system correctly (and good money that they did), they never get anything that can resolve to a credit card number.
@_date: 2015-03-09 22:56:20
No, that's absolutely not how that works.
Apple only gets a token. That token is tied to both the merchant (apple, in this case) and the consumer (you). In the Visa/MC system, that token can be used "only" to send money from the consumer to the account associated with that particular merchant.
So even if someone stole your applepay token, all they'd be able to do is drain your account into apple. Which would be a whole lot of work for a hacker and would accomplish nothing at the end of the day (because apple can just reverse the charges).
@_date: 2015-03-10 06:08:14
It's vastly more difficult to have an ongoing hack that sits on the central server and changes their entire payments process, than simply a one time hack that steals a server's information.
The only time that hacks like this go undetected are when a company has a shockingly poorly organized IT system and multiple points of entry to watch. The chances of an ongoing hack like this happening to applepay are basically nil.

Also if you're a huge nerd with not getting investigated by the IRS, you should keep careful track of how much you spent on BTC. You have to pay capital gains tax on them when you return it to fiat (30% tax if returned to fiat in &lt;1 year, 15% tax if returned in &gt;1 year from time of purchase). That may change in the future with new tax laws about online currencies, but for now it is basically the only guide of what the IRS is going to expect.
Of course, if you keep it in btc and spend it in btc and never turn it back into USD, that's not gain (as far as I am aware, I am not a lawyer). Also subject to change with the tax laws (maybe).
And you really don't want to get audited with lots of gains and no way to explain them.

Gyft has an address that it generates when you go to buy a gyft card. Just copy that address, and paste it into the "send money" link on coinbase. Make sure to send the right amount of bitcoin to the address.
When Gyft sees that the wallet it gave you has the right amount of bitcoin in it, it accepts payment and sends you the gyft card.
Make sure you buy the giftcard for yourself, or for a friend "at the store", because right now you cannot buy a giftcard for yourself and then later decide to send it to a friend.

Coinbase.com lets you sign up as a business account. 
So you can sign up on behalf of the charity using that. Once you have an account, click the "receive money" link, and that will generate both a QR code and a character-string code. If money is sent to either, it will be held in the coinbase wallet. Then you can sell the bitcoin on coinbase for USD and have it sent to the linked business-deposit-account (which is done automatically when you sell bitcoin).
End story: You get a scanner code you can print out, and if anyone scans it with their phone they can use it to donate bitcoin. You also get a character-string you can put in your website and accept bitcoin donations that way as well.

My uncle owns a small capital management firm (with whom I have most of my assets in long term stocks). When I requested 50k cashed out to take advantage of the early part of the most recent bubble, he was pretty skeptical.

@_date: 2013-11-22 18:22:42
You're thinking of it in terms of "bob sells 11 million USD in bitcoin, and suzy buys 11 million in bitcoin"
What really happened is that there is a spectrum of buy and sell orders, waiting for someone to meet them at that price. 
1. So maybe 20 bitcoins are on the market at $600, and 80 more are on the market at 590, and 100 more at 580.
2. At the same time, 200 bitcoin purchase orders exist at 520, 100 orders at 530, and 50 orders at 560.
So he comes along and says "I'm going to sell all these bitcoins" and then he sells 50 100 and buys up half of the purchase orders at $520 (all automatically, as the program makes matches based on maximizing profit). Then the highest buy order that exists is at $520 (because he just sold a bunch). So someone comes along and puts in a new buy order at $550 (because they want to buy bitcoins and there is now this huge gulf between the buyers and sellers), and some market trader who just bought a ton of bitcoins  sees that and flips around to sell his coins back to the guy 
So the speedy market traders just made $30 per coin purchased off of a pair of big fish who were trading, because the big fish saw the dip as an opportunity to get coins well below market price, rather than a panic event. Even though the market moved more.
TLDR: Yes, the 2mil dump incited a panic, but there are a lot of factors as to why it did.

Even if you narrow your thought experiment to just "actively circulating" bitcoins, it would be essentially zero if you cannot exchange them for goods or services (except to cash them out at the end for a fixed value-per-coin).
Because as the supply of remaining bitcoins still in circulation diminishes, the remaining actors holding still-circulating bitcoins would value them higher and higher, until the last bitcoin would be worth the entire market value of every other bitcoin (because the other coins would be worthless without that one coin). And if you paid that value, then your remaining bitcoins would be worth less money than the amount of money spent to acquire all of them. Meaning that a rational actor would never purchase bitcoin from the start because they know that the end state is not profitable. Thus paralyzing the market and crashing the value to zero.
Still, interesting to think about. And it logically follows that markets have no value if you cannot use the goods/services represented by the market.

I was looking at it from a concept point of view.
Such as remembering "monkey vanilla banana" and telling someone to send bitcoin to that. The actual technical details of how to send that are actually pretty flexible.
1. Email, as you described above
2. Put a transaction on the bitcoin chain that includes a comment text of those 3 words, and a public key. When they go to look it up, their software searches the bitcoin transaction chain for comments that have that exact text.
3. have some central website that stores public keys for people, such as monkeyvanillabanana.bitcoin.com and when queried it responds with a public key address.
4. Link it into one of the instant message networks, and have a bot set up which responds to any given message to it with a bitcoin public address. So there would be an AOL bot that whenever it received the words "monkeyvanillabanana" that responds with a corresponding public key
The end result is that you can remember your public key in some memorable way. But the actual method for keeping these able-to-be-remembered public keys is pretty flexible.

The summary that makes the most sense to me is this:
Tea party candidates come from 100% assured victory districts. What this means is, their district is always going to be republican (due to gerrymandering). So, the way they win primaries (the only election that matters to them) is by being more extreme republican than other extreme republicans, because only republicans vote in primaries. So, by shutting down the government and trying to force concessions, they're showing they are more extreme republicans than anyone else. It doesn't matter to them if they ruin the economy, they're not running for the good of their district, they're running so they win the primary election in another 2/4 years.

I've seen multi-million (USD) bets.

A good deal of people "would" throw a percent or two of their holdings into BTC, if they had an easy way to do so (such as an ETF). It indeed would be enough to make quite a dent if they did. I think people here don't understand that "100 thousand dollars" is a small amount of money to some wealthy families.
The top 1% holds 42% of the investing wealth, the next 19% combined hold 53% of the investing wealth. Which means you need roughly 19 small investors to equal 1 whale investor. 
In terms of investor power, the upper middle class is pretty much powerless. They get the bottom 5% of the above numbers (being at the 14-19% range above), while having a much larger population to spread the wealth over.
Whales control the market, everyone else gobbles up their scraps. That is how investing works. Either you are a whale, you work for a whale, you try to guess where a whale is going to be, or you try to influence a whale to go where you want him to be.
So, long story short time. If a single whale decides he is interested in bitcoin, he could double the market cap over night. If several do, bitcoin''s value could become obscenely large.

Try 4 decades if you're talking about real-wages. You'd be better off working an average-income job in 1975 than you would be working an average income job today.

I agree. I spent roughly $250 on Gyft for xmas gift cards. Family is having trouble redeeming gift cards, the interface for buying them is terrible, and for redeeming them. Would not buy again.

At all of the senate hearings, they have maintained that they have followed the law in every respect. And they actually have (mostly). 
The problem is that they have a secret court that provides secret rulings along the lines of "do whatever you want whenever you want". It's kind of hard to violate the law when you have a blanket ruling like that.

Actually, it is usually the other way around. Eternal September and all that. The more serious bitcoin subs are elsewhere.

You lock in the price at time of purchase or sale.
The reason it takes a week is so that they can verify that your account is active, and that you're not scamming them (stolen account info, waiting for the transaction to fully process, ect).
I'm not saying that it is BAD that they want you to wait a week, just that I'm sad I couldn't buy up more coins at the $200-300 range.

It is roughly equivalent to taking a bunch of print-currency and lighting it on fire. With much of the same impacts.
Though, if a huge amount of physical money was destroyed, the fed would just print more to compensate, while bitcoin has a fixed rate of new-coin creation.

Aww, thats a shame. Here I was hopeing that Riot had implemented a btc transfer in their store.
@_date: 2013-12-09 22:07:51
Ohh, you mean linking a bitcoin address to a lookup table. So you have a passphrase that is your public key (ie: email) and that public key would be a bitcoin address that would be transaction sendable.
It would be useful to have a public key that is easy-to-remember. I agree.

I agree with you, and am failing to see where the disagreement is. If a whale decided to move a comparatively small (for him) amount of money over to btc from gold, it would greatly upset the market, and it sounds like you agree with that.
Also, a 4 billion market difference is the difference between today's price and the peak of the last bubble.

Well yeah. Because if he did, nobody would send him their wallets again. If he keeps doing it for a 20% fee, he gets more people to send him their wallets. Rinse, repeat.
Turns out that honesty is profitable.

That is an actually significantly more likely chance.
[80/2.50e6]( is your chance to be struck by lightning in a year.
3.15e7 seconds in a year (assuming "the exact same moment" is as precise as one second, just to make this easier).
So 2.5e6 / 3.15e7  = chance to be struck by lightning each second, giving you a roughly 80/8^8 chance, which reduces nicely to 1/10^9 chance. Assuming you have a family of 4 other people (wife, two kids, dog), that is 1/10^9^5, which reduces to 1/10^45 (massive rounding taking place here to avoid confusing stuff).
So, you are a hundred times "more likely" to have every member of your family struck by lightning in the same second (and by separate lightning bolts), as you are to have an existing private key be taken.

When surveys are made, they have a lot of normalizing questions just to gauge quality of respondent.
5% of people surveyed are "pro cancer" when asked if they are "for or against cancer".
So, yes, the average person is stupid. And there is always some percentage of the population that is extremely stupid, and this percentage is likely around the 5% range.

Find the receiving address from the wallet you want to put it into, and copy it. Then go to the wallet you want to send it from, and go to "send money" and put in the copied address as the destination.
If it is your first time, I'd suggest moving some small fraction first (0.0000001 btc) and seeing if it goes through, then moving the rest of your money.

Actually, it absolutely can and does control how much it prints. The difficulty self-adjusts so one new block is mined roughly every 10 minutes.

That assumes far too much organization and far too many points of failure. You would have to have a lot of people, all instructed to do this and not say anything about it. And there would be a significant number of people waiting in line to expose them.
Occam's razor, the simplest solution is that they are idiots yelling for media attention, it is also the most likely.

I mathed it up for you elsewhere in this thread, basically, it doesn't matter. If you made a private key for every human who had ever lived on earth at any point in history, it wouldn't even make it to "rounding error" levels of significance.
If you made a private key for every molecule present in the entire earth, it still wouldn't make it to a number even close to it (still 20 zeros off of being within the range of 1%).
