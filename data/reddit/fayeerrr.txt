... And some free altcoins. Nope!
@_date: 2017-08-02 11:39:21
You should be happy.
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:07:52
NO! Really?
@_date: 2017-08-03 02:33:56
That's reality...
@_date: 2017-08-03 14:49:52
What's making you hold?
@_date: 2017-08-02 12:11:32
No. Wasn't it Greg Maxwell himself who said that if some people are not happy, they're free to do a fork. 
Now there's a fork for better or worse.
@_date: 2017-08-03 02:31:41
They love to pump and they love making money. Why would they attack this chain now when it is better to make money.
@_date: 2017-08-03 02:03:57
They are free to dump sure, but not everybody will. I predict most will hold onto them because that's the more practical thing to do. Not everyone is stupid.
@_date: 2017-08-09 07:47:44
lol. Who owns this? You?
@_date: 2017-08-10 10:10:46
What can you do? They have the politicians in their pockets like nickles and dimes.
@_date: 2017-08-02 11:42:03
@_date: 2017-08-10 05:51:50
lol. Fucking idiots. Don't they realize banks run everything in that country?
@_date: 2017-08-10 16:11:14
lol wat? I expected him to hold his split BCC and hold both. Not dump one for the other.
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:55:23
That's Roger.
@_date: 2017-08-02 12:35:28
True and altcoins and ICOs have been doing the same. Why are you worried? If you really did believe in Bitcoin and trust that it will always come out on top, then the free BCC should make you happy.
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:20:35
@_date: 2017-08-02 11:38:32
Would make sense to bring more volume over there.
@_date: 2017-08-02 12:14:47
Why are you so concerned? It's the whales who are mostly trading this all the way to $1000 anyway. They can afford to lose some money.
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:24:15
The title is untrue. If you missed out on BCC, of course you missed out on free money.
@_date: 2017-08-03 14:57:19
Same. Actually, I don't get all the hate from both sides.
@_date: 2017-08-03 01:35:50
But it won't stay that way. It will also become itsown coin, have its own community and have its own economy.
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:43:39
That's Roger Ver getting so
@_date: 2017-08-02 11:44:35
What you can you do...
@_date: 2017-08-02 11:41:41
But really it doesn't make sense to dump now even if deposits are enabled. Not all hates BCC enough not to hodl.
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:31:28
Of course. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:27:43
I don't think margin trading is allowed for BCC. 
The reason why its rising is clearly because of manipulation by the whales. They could be pushing this to trade above $1000 with the help of the miners.
@_date: 2017-08-02 11:37:20
Where? Why bring this up now?
@_date: 2017-08-08 13:00:43
Knew it.
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:30:44
Price crash. Give it 3 months. But it wont go away.
@_date: 2017-08-28 05:11:23
And the miners?
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:29:45
Hehe. It's not over yet. This is actually your window to get more BCC before the next pump. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 02:22:15
Yes. It adds more value to your portfolio. Once the China comes in BCH could maintain a value of over $1000 per coin and hold top 2 in market cap.
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:21:26
Yes I think.
@_date: 2017-05-27 22:41:07
I agree with To everyone who bought at the top. Google "darknet market drugs".
@_date: 2017-07-19 12:19:18
James is Jihan in Chinese.
@_date: 2017-07-26 11:40:30
Probably laundering for DNMs and uses BTCe to cash out to fiat.
@_date: 2017-05-24 07:25:58
My take on UASF 
@_date: 2017-07-29 03:41:47
Yay. May BCC have it's own success. Now.. Leave Bitcoin alone, you have your own altcoin now.
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:42:08
And they're wildly buying BTC... On credit.  
@_date: 2017-07-29 06:20:24
Yay congrats to Roger and Jihan. They can go their own way now and leave BTC alone.
@_date: 2017-06-16 07:00:30
Bitmex should list a futures market.
@_date: 2017-07-29 04:28:44
You're so clueless.
@_date: 2017-06-15 11:42:30
Good point. It was wise of Charlie Lee to leave.
