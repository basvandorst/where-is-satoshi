On my iphone, i just swipe right and see the Coinbase/Stocks widget with Bitcoin at the top. Don't even need to unlock the phone.

It's comin back down!!!

Hey thanks man. You were way more helpful than that other asshole. Have some gold. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:07:21
It's goin back up!!!

Well, if you sold at 15k you would have made 5k profit. Then buying back in at 12k and selling at 20k would make you another 8k profit. Whereas if you bought in at 10k and sold at 20k, thats 10k profit. So the first scenario is more profitable. I think...

You and everybody else.

Re-read it again.. I read it as investing 10k at 10k value. So yeah, my math is off.

Can't buy shit with Coinbase crashing!! C'mon man.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:10:45
So are their any reasons why you WOULDN'T want to use a hardware wallet? If i transferred my BTC from Coinbase on to one, would my BTC no longer be displayed on Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:22:50
That makes sense, thank you!
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:53:10
Figure your shit out, Coinbase....
