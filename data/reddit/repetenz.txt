No, but have a solid understanding of capacity management and the price of disk so struggle to understand the concerns with slightly larger block sizes. Sure massively larger block sizes today may cause issues , but a minor increase now to support the transaction volume would be nice thanks.

Congestion 
100000+ unconfirmed transactions

Except that you can't actually use Bitcoin due to congestion and high fees...?
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:29:23
Not in the slightest, genuinely wondering...

It’s a site that shows you the backlog and how much fees are required to get your transactions thru.

It’s working fine, shows you need over 850 satoshis per byte right now if you want your transaction included in the next block.

Not sure I buy this argument, storage and processing power are cheap compared to the impact transaction blockages and high fees will have on adoption.
Can you back up what you say with any numbers?

High fees are by design in this 1mb block world.

I’m no ones minion thanks, just making sure everyone knows what coin I’m talking about

I just sent many bitcoin cash around today with only a couple of cents transaction fee. In order to sell some bitcoin today I had to use an $11 fee, which is a huge difference. Fees that large make it uneconomical to make small transactions.
