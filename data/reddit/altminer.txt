You are seriously trying to argue that a definition of a word puts more blame on the protocol that on a BUSINESS THAT MAKES ITS PROFITS ON THE PROTOCOL ! Mt. Gox voluntarily setup themselves, they write their own code, they decide how they verify transactions, they have made millions and are able to audit their own code and even pay programmers. How is this "bitcoins fault" ? Bitcoin is not a business, its software, any problem is mt. gox's problem only.

Recovering a "lost" transaction is not too hard, don't panic.
If it has 0 confirms and is not on the blockchain, get a backup of the wallet.dat (before transaction preferably) and also download the multibit light wallet (multibit.org) import your wallet, wait for multibit to sync .. and BOOOM unspent coins still in your wallet and now you can send them again, or send them somewhere else. blockchain.info might give a double spend warning on the transaction until one of them is confirmed.

ouch rough, many mistakes. You let emotions decide your trading behavior. And for saying you were planning to invest long term ... nothing in your behavior shows that.
Also I find it weird that you would not invest in other coins because of their status of being less used, but when you did finally buy some alts you went with KittehCoin and LTC, I wish you the best of luck, but the big coin gaining traction right now is Dogecoin. From 2 Months of CPU mining and gambling, I have already purchased a new desktop and a GPU to mine with, but ofcourse when you start mining something day 1 you have better chance at luck.

since the block reward halves, we will NEVER get to the 21 millionth coin. NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER. We will always get closer, and then reward halves and we are further away.

Use the import options in multibit. No need to drop it in a folder. just Browse, select.

Awesome way to stay impartial and open to responses while asking a question !
I have been mining bitcoin and alt coins for about 2.5 years. I have never invested USD into it. I have used a majority of my coins to buy new hardware. New GPUs, PSUs, motherboards, asics .... My desktop has been upgraded way more than my 9-5 would have allowed me to.

so lets say I am interested in buying like 2 shares. 0.024 BTC. Is that possible ? Would that really give me the equivalent of 7.05 GH/s

I have never had issues with sealswithclubs.eu. They always seem to work great. The also have Browser, PC, Android and Iphone clients to play on :)
They also do hourly free-to-enter tournaments if you wanna just try it out. Top finishers get a free BTC prize :)

I really like btc-e.com. Withdrawal of USD from there is extremely difficult, if not impossible, but quickly trading USD/BTC works very well. They have full trading API available and you can even find BTC-e bots on github. They also have their own trading terminal, called MetaTrader4 which they also have Iphone/Android versions available. So if you already have btc, send there, trade until you are happy with your profit (or decide to cut your losses) and send the btc back out to coinbase or bitstamp for getting USD back into your bank account.

Well I happen to have multiple experiences with this ! I am very good at making bad decisions and wasting cryptocoins :) You are starting at 0, So I feel ANYTHING is better than 0 .. ANYTHING !
1. Mining - Everyone will tell you it is not worth the time. If you happen to have cheap or free electricity, go for it ! go here: [coinwarz.com]( find the most profitable coin(s) and mine it, trade them in at coin-e, cryptsy, or coinex for BTC. I actually still CPU and GPU mine along with my block erupters. Even a older CPU (Pentium Core 2 duo) will get 10-15 kh/s (about 0.0002 / $.20 a day). Of course almost every coin has been increasing in value, so it is possible you bring in alot more.
2. Faucets, I actually have done great on faucets, have used many faucet coins to buy humblebundles and random small things. The trick is to look for the altcoin faucets, they will tend to give you more coin than BTC faucets nowadays. I include things like Bitcoinget.com, bitvisitor.com, coinad.com as faucets as well. People will say its not worth your time, but the couple dollars I pull from faucets have doubled, tripled or even quadrupled in value from when i got them.
3. Sealswithclubs.eu - if you are decent at poker, this site runs hourly free tournaments with BTC prizes going to the top places.
I tried to stick to free options or where you only invest time. Buying is the easiest way of course, but not everyone has that option. 
Working for bitcoin always sounds promising, but then I go over to and the listings outnumber the amount of people who want work done, so that makes it difficult.

I'm shocked no one has talked about Alternate Coins and Trading. With a little luck you can do alot better. This is what is making me profit right now. I have been mining [PPCoin]( and [Freicoin]( and then trading for [Bitcoin]( on sites like [BTC-E]( and [Cryptsy]( I only have 1 single USB Block Erupter and a ATI 6770 for a combined strength of 500 MH/s. The two Alternate Cryptocoins I mentioned PPC &amp; Freicoin are both SHA-256 so they can be used with the Block Erupter. The 6770 I jump all over the place between SHA-256 and scrypt alternate coins just watching profitability from [Dustcoin.com]( With my small hashrate mining Bitcoin directly I would only pull in .0118 per week, but with my "strategy" (what i thought everyone was doing) I pull in triple to quadruple that for sure. The SR "crash" was great for someone who watches Bitcoin news all day, I sold all my btc @ 119 and re-bought @ 85 increasing my entire holdings about 16%. So while these might seem almost pointless with the low hashing rate I still can pull in $3-$4 a week and more in big market swings of any alternate cryptocurrency. I will still be buying a couple more USB Erupters and prob a larger ASIC if they ever become cheaper.
So that's my input on why people might still buy these.
But, I was also the guy still CPU mining when everyone said it wasn't "viable". I mined Litecoin and they went from $0.07 per coin to $2 per coin. It is what I used to buy Power Supply, 6770 and Block Erupter. All with BTC directly. Its rough for a poor miner, but gotta keep on keepin' on.

I have bought Block Erupters, 4-6 pin connectors, steam games, no problems. Built in escrow seems to help out with the transaction process a lot. Seller doesn't send until coins are held in Escrow, Coins aren't released until Buyer marks order as received.
