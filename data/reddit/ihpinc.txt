Thanks. What do I need to get started. I am internet savvy (run an online business) but clueless about gaming. Can I do this on a laptop? I think what you're doing is so cool.

I think this is great. The mind of a kid is like a sponge. I've been teaching my kids a little german  age 4 and 6. I'm amazed at how quickly they have picked it up. They are like little sponges. For those of you being so critical, How many parents leave their kids glued to the TV and spend no time with them. To be interacting with your child like this and possibly introducing him to something he may love in the future is great...no different than introducing him to baseball or soccer. Could you tell me what kind of hardware I need for this. Just a laptop or what? Thanks

Not assuming that at all. My comment was that in this country I think kids are just plain bored. I can't speak for other countries, but when I refer to this country, I mean the one I live in. US test scores are much lower than many countries and that has not always been the case.

Thanks so much. That looks great. Yes, the firefighter helicopter idea definitely sounds like something my 4 year old would love! I've bookmarked your site.

Teaching a kid how to implement an idea, how to work, how to learn something new and use his brain...... you bad bad parent...you should be giving him a trophy for breathing instead and don't challenge him because that would hurt his "wittle self esteem"...ok I'll stop being sarcastic now. This is why other countries are surpassing the US in Math, Science etc. I think many kids in this country are just plain bored.

You are under estimating what 5 year olds can do these days. My 4 year old is more savvy on the ipad than I am.

He probably understands it better than us old folks. These kids have been playing games where they get "coins" as rewards which can be spent for something they would like to buy. Sounds a lot like Bitcoin. I think the older folks have less of a grasp on virtual currency because we did not grow up with it.

I would love to teach my kids to code. Taking a look at the site now.
