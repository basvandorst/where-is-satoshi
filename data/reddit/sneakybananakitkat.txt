My prediction Bitcoin will be : $816.50 in 2017
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:24:17
That's exactly right.

No that cannot be legally argued at all, the network is consensus but ownership cannot be attributed for partaking in it.

Changes every few seconds but its range is like 10-30

Crypto currency in the 21st century and the gold standard to me are two very different things. Bitcoin is a proven tech but this tech is being improved upon and faster better blockchains emerging.

who can afford the fees too!

Well there is no brand, (not in the sense of normal property rights) there is no trademark and it was built on open source software so.... stop complaining.

No, only the creator Satoshi could have made that call but he GAVE AWAY the technology...it is not fraudulent. 
And actually as people keep saying he had a vision and created Bitcoin but there was no caveats with it.

Not being able to move your money is not a feature.

Although it was the first from which all overs have to thank...it is not the best anymore.

Well isn't bitcoin an open source unpatented project? and by its very nature is a proponent of the free market?
There is no brand

Well what if you try to argue that...and what if Satoshi turns up? and basically says I created this all of it I can prove it crptographically. And what if he says I created it for a specific reason and it wasn't so people could argue about ownership or trademarks...sometimes I feel the world dosn't even deserve bitcoin in any form. If Satoshi was that bothered which he clearly wasn't he would have registered the domain or trademarked and patented his block chain tech...but he didn't and that's that...this is what happens when that is not done and I'm sorry legally there is nothing you can do about it. 
Look, nobody owns this technology, we all partake in it but can never claim ownership. It was a gift given to us. The bigger picture was to overturn banks which bitcoin cash is also helping to do so why do we need to fight amongst ourselves. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:32:00
Yes but nobody can claim the ownership of Bitcoin other than Satoshi and he didn't, so Saying it's fraud is moot...you don't own it and nor do I.

What are you talking about, people do trust Bcash...there is so much trash talking its unreal.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:20:57
No one can say for sure...Bcash seems to have an advantage over btc though.
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:22:33
Bcash has just as much utility as bitcoin don't forget
