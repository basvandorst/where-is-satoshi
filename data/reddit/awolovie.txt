Actually  Platinum is 50 times more rare than Gold.
But, Platinum has less uses and more substitutes. 
Platinum has the substitute of Palladium, the element above it on the table. These are both used in Nuclear catalysts, catalytic converters and so on. 
The quantities required for these things are also incredibly small. 2 ounces of Platinum or Paladium can run an entire nuclear core's catalyst mesh. And a catalytic converter can be literally nanograms at this point.
Gold's use can't be substituted by it's cousin on the table, Silver, because silver tarnishes and gold doesn't. Silver lacks the same maleability and isn't usable as a catalyst or membrane. 
You have quite literally no idea what you're talking about. 
You got confronted with this reality and you googled it because you just got caught with your pants down around your ankles so badly it's humiliating. 
You are a retarded person.

Lol, of course Iron has more uses than Gold...it's also like 3 trillion times as plentiful. What type of fucking Retarded argument is that?
The existence and uses of an element on the periodic table is not an 'old paradigm' 
Gold is Element  you can't just fucking 'replace it with a new paradigm'
What a fucking retard. 
EDIT: Looked up Iron vs Gold, Gold will effectively mine out by 2030. At current Rates, Iron will mine out but about  3000 years from now.

So you are talking about your own ignorance?
It was coming across like you were insulting the people explaining it to you. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:40:13
So in other words...Yes. Of course you paid a fee.  
@_date: 2018-09-06 01:39:34
No, if a bank does it it's illegal. 
If you hand someone bitcoin it's not illegal for them to keep it.
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:40:35

That's kind of a non-answer. 
Why are they good? they may not be horrible, but in what way is it actively good? 
@_date: 2018-09-06 15:04:39
No, that's illegal too. 
Bitcoin it isn't though.

Lawyer here, theft is not theft. There are statutes for different classes of things. People are right to say the in many jurisdictions, Bitcoin or other crypto would not qualify. It's neither physical nor has recognized value in many courts. Might as well be reddit karma from a court system perspective
Stealing from someone in a contract doesn't make it civil, if you genuinely stole it, it would still  be criminal.
@_date: 2018-08-22 03:42:33
They didn't steal it, he handed them the coins. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 03:40:35
Well the idea of an ETF is intentionally to not own the coins but get the benefits while being insured or hold it in a tax sheltered account or something you can't otherwise. 
@_date: 2019-03-13 22:12:04
So again, quite specifically he kept saying the present value would be going up, not that you're literally getting more money.
And he gave multiple examples, one where you spent and did literally nothing, a second example where you did spend a large amount each year, an example where you spent money and invested safely etc...
I kind of feel like you're backpeddling a lot here. The poster covered the example you're talking about I just think you didn't understand it.  
He never said you were actually getting more money it says 'present value' multiple times. You simply chose to ignore that part. 
@_date: 2019-03-13 21:49:32
That is correct, yeah.   
He/she seems to say specifically in a deflationary world where the deflation is 2%.  And I think they said in 20 years, not in 2020.   
So 10 Billion \* 1.02\^20 = 14.85 Billion. So yes, he/she is right.   
If there's 2% deflation then the $10 billion is worth $14.85 Billion in Present value.   
So lets say a house today costs $1 million. The person can buy 1,000 of those houses today, but if the economy is deflationary at 2% he could buy 1,485 of the same car in 20 years  
Do you get that as a concept? It's not any different than the math in lending. 
@_date: 2019-11-25 16:46:18
This kind of sums up why it's not useful though... you're right, the SF model isn't a thing with consistent parameters and different assets have totally different variables.  
So if someone makes a new crypto, or a new valuable mining material is found or whatever...you can't apply a model to it.   
And this thing was made with 10 years of BTC data and has only been 'predicting' for like 6 months now, and those 6 months have been not very accurate.
@_date: 2019-11-05 16:22:55
A home provides future economic benefit. You live in it, it has utility. They usually appreciate in value too, but that's unnecessary.   
You can sell it for a value and it has utility to use, so it's an asset.   
Assets can have maintenance costs, and they can even lose value and still be assets.  
Don't be daft. Cryptocurrency doesn't change basic accounting, stop treating basic concepts as fucking conspiracies.
@_date: 2019-03-13 21:17:03
Lol, uh, then can you lend me 100 BTC Today, and I'll pay you back the same number of them in 20 years? 
That would be a fair deal to you?
@_date: 2019-03-13 22:27:20
Right, and that's true.
1 BTC today does not have the same value as 1 BTC in 2030.
Again you're trying to pretend like we're not discussing present value. The poster said "Present value" multiple times and I think I've said it like 8 times now.
Do you think the present value of 1 BTC in 2030 is equal to 1 BTC today?
Are you trying to just say he said 'Present Value' a bunch of times but you found one sentence where he didn't type those words in that specific sentence so you win because he didn't repeat it over and over? I don't understand your argument.
@_date: 2018-06-25 18:11:42
Re-reading that post, no he isn't saying that.  
He's saying it's a stupid point to say 'Adding $300 Billion will increase marketcap by $300 Billion' because that's wrong.
I think the point was that it's so obvious to say that if the amount of investment increased 3 fold that the price will increase that it's just an idiotic point. 
It's like saying if we turn on 3 more heaters, the temperature will rise. 
@_date: 2019-10-17 03:30:23
Nah that isn't cash like you're thinking, they own bonds that can be sold easily.
They're obviously not sitting on actual cash, they would be giving away millions a day in interest from not investing it.
That's one of the objections people make, like how to you use Crypto for debt instruments? Like is it somehow on chain? But paying interest kind of means you'd need more bitcoin in the system but you can't.
I think what people are saying in this thread is like, there's no way to multiply the value by having the coin in multiple places at once. So you can't compare the M3 money supply number to what is essentially an M1-only Bitcoin. There's can't be any such thing as an M3 bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-09 22:33:50
How's that work though?  
You've got 2 worlds, one where bitcoin has taken over, and one where we're still in normal Earth  
World 1: Bitcoin takes over.. You sell a house, and the person buys your house with bitcoin. No value increase or decrease occurs. You haven't increased or decreased Bitcoin demand or price in that operation.  
World 2: Bitcoin isn't dominant... you sell a house and someone gives you US dollars for it. You take those dollars and exchange them for Bitcoins. You have no increased demand for and potentially the price of Bitcoin.   
But the house wasn't relevant there. The house was just how you got the US Dollars, you're actually exchanging value from Fiat currency to the crypto. That's not capturing the real estate value, that house is still worth whatever that house is worth.   
That's what people are saying throughout this thread, you can get the total value of all currency in the world, but it's hard to go beyond that. Because beyond that there's nothing else to increase the value.   
So Bitcoin can become worth 100% of the world's currency...but it can't become worth 100% of the currency and the real estate and the derivatives and so on, that doesn't make any sense mathematically.   
So no matter what you're going to be bounded by the total value of currency needed for liquidity in the world, and today that number is 20 to 40 Trillion.
@_date: 2019-06-10 15:31:38
Has nothing to do with correct or incorrect values. 
If real estate is massively down, so is the currency. One doesn't transfer value to the other. 
The things you're saying are beyond misunderstanding this stuff, it's more like you're never read or been educated on finance or economics at all. 
Like it's just some stuff you're making up or something, I don't even know how to correct it because it's unclear what you're even trying to say or how you think any of this works.
@_date: 2019-06-22 22:59:23
The 'untaken' bitcoin aren't 'unsold' they don't actually exist yet.
Think of it like they actually call it, mining.
You can only get these new ones by mining them using special equipment, which costs a lot of money, energy and time to do.
What you're buying is bitcoin other people already own, and you're buying the ones other people are willing to sell.
So there might be say, 16 million coins out there, but at any given time people are only offering to sell a small portion of those. 
For instance I own 3ish, but I'm not looking to sell them, so those aren't available to anyone to buy them right now. 
So you're buying the ones people own and are willing to sell, so they determine what they're willing to sell them for. 
So if the price is $10,600 it means no one is willing to sell theirs for less than that amount right now.
Now bitcoin has many multiple markets which makes it harder to get a single price, but it averages of to a similar price.
So generally price will rise when there's more buyers than sellers and drop when there's more sellers than buyers.
@_date: 2019-06-22 22:42:18
It's just simple supply and demand. 
So if there's say 3 coins available at 10593, 2 available at 10597 and 4 available at 10600... and someone buys 7 coins and is willing to pay those prices, they consume the ones for sale at cheaper prices and leave us with 2 left at 10600 as the cheapest. 
those orders happen and change quickly but that's how it works.

This shows a strong argument against Dollar Cost Averaging.
You made $3944 by using DCA
Had you just invested the full $1500 Jan 1st 2017, you'd be at a profit of  $16079 instead. 
I think you just mean buying on a set purchase plan as you get the money, not 'DCA' ?

Anyone else just assume anyone who just generically says "Oh, well it's the whales!" is a fucking idiot? 
Why'd it go up "FOMO"
Why'd It go down "Whales!"
Or maybe "FUD" 
Stop talking like idiots. 
No numbers or substantiation in this at all.
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:35:09
Yeah, I'd just avoid the term Dollar Cost Averaging when talking about it then
For anyone in investments generally 'DCA' might as well be 'healing crystals' or 'essential oils' it's kind of a scammy thing people lie to clients about.
