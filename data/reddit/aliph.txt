Yes, unlike the shining examples put forth by the other parties.

Warren buffet explicitly wants high prices to encourage long term institutional investors who are in it for the long haul, and to prevent speculation day to day.
Seems somewhat analogous to bitcoin...

When I read Peter Thiel's book Zero to One I immediately googled 'Elon Satoshi' to see if there were any tin foil hat theories out there.  When Thiel (a vocal free market libertarian) talks about PayPal's mission in that book the similarities to BitCoin just jumped off the page.    And what you said, how many people could just let it sit untouched and not invite the publicity - maybe the CEO of a kinda shady spy company or the CEO of startups disrupting just about everything and doesn't yet want to piss off banks and governments too.  I think the average non-billionaire engineer at this point would have stepped forward and claimed the fame and talked about how great BTC was while HODLing or have quietly cashed some small portion out.

Boring Company and Neuralink didn't exist then, nor did OpenAI (which he stepped away from because of potential conflicts of interest with Tesla).  He has literally started and become CEO of two new companies since  then and hired tens of thousands of people.

It was probably thought of at PayPal or among the PayPal mafia.  Thiel (PayPal co-founder)  is extremely philosophical.  I could see him and Elon coming up with the broad strokes together.  The original BTC source code had plans for a P2P marketplace embedded (sound like eBay?) So it very well could have been thought of and first written years prior.
The white paper definitely has Musk hyperloop similarities 'hey look at this napkin sketch of a hyperloop, I'm kinda busy, why isn't anyone building this'?  His writing if not his speech also tries to use very simple and clear statements which the white paper has... Which doesn't prove anyone wrote it but I do think it indicates it was written by someone who has communicated revolutionary ideas to people who don't (and won't for years) understand before.

Do you often use bitcoin?

SIFI (too big to fail regulations) incentivizes mega banks (a very unintended consequence) due to cost of regulatory compliance.  While there is massive wealth in banking, it is relatively low margin business and there is hige pressure to reduce costs.

The amount of dumbfuckery in this thread around securities laws is astounding.  I'm a libertarian and I get that bitcoin draws a libertarian/anarchist following but goddamn people just because you don't like a law doesn't mean it isn't the law.  We need to work to change securities laws that were written in 1933 to accommodate cryptocurrency not live in magical fairytale land and pretend like they don't exist.

Not unless there was a state exemption for the sale of securities also available, which there often is not.

The head of the SEC says otherwise.  Read the Howie factors test and tell me how it is not.

Securities Act of 1933 and state 'blue sky' laws.  It's not illegal to purchase, but it is illegal to sell.  The sale of securities is illegal without an exemption at the federal and state level.
JOBS act offerings are rare, and shitty exemptions and in most cases are harder to comply with than to just raise from accredited investors.  
@_date: 2018-02-03 05:25:40
Done hundreds of 506(b) offerings never once seen one provide the disclosure actually required for non-accredited investors.  It's a pain in the ass as an understatement.
And if you do a 4(a)(2) you still need a state exemption, which is often not available.
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:56:57


Except for state securities laws in the US.  You might have a 4(a)(2) exemption at the federal level, but that exemption from the '33 Act does not get you NSMIA preemption of state law and many states do not have self executing exemptions for non-accredited investors.  Also, institutional investors run for the hills when they see non-accredited investors are involved in securities offerings because it can jeopardize their own securities exemption.

The disclosure requirements to non accredited investors under 506(b) are ridiculous.  I've done hundreds of offerings under 506(b) and never once seen one meet the disclosure thresholds for a valid offering to non-accredited.  And for the amount of work that is needed, it isn't worth the small checks a non-accredited investor can write.  Neither 504 or 4(a)(2) offerings offer federal preemption so you still have to comply with state securities laws, and there are very few exemptions available, and again, it's a lot of work with little benefit, and is almost always easier to approach institutional investors.  Title III is also more expensive and cumbersome than just selling to an institutional investor.

Absolutely not an accurate assessment of US securities law.
To your comment 1), this number of security holders does not provide an exemption for the sale of securities.  It is a trigger for when a company must become public.  This threshold (pre-amendment) is what forced FB to go public.
2) if you don't solicit investment, but know a non-accredited investor, they can maybe fit the 4(a)(2) 'non-public offering' exemption from the '33 Act at the Federal Level, but you still need an exemption at the state level as this exemption does not get NSMIA preemption of state law.  While 506(b) technically does allow for non-accredited investment, the disclosure requirements are incredibly burdensome - having done hundreds of securities offerings I have never seen one do a 506(b) to non-accredited investors. 
Some Employees actually are accredited investors - not just wealth is part of the Rule 501 definition.
