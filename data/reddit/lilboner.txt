It honestly isn't that simple.It's not only impossible to just simply switch ownership of addresses, you also won't get support from people. The only reason ETC got support was because people thought a bailout hardfork isn't what hardforks are for, which I agree to.
But no big organizations or exchanges would support a fork in which the top 100 addresses would suddenly get new owners. Maybe some extreme socialists, but not enough to actually get a big trading platform in which the value of the coin is very significant. Besides, the old chain would exist too.

It's a little more complicated than that.
If miners are on a huge loss they might want to manipulate the price up to stay in business, which if a few mining companies would work together can easily be done  if the price is only 500$. Even if they decide to sell, the blockrewards nowadays is so low that it won't influece the price too much as long as many hodlers hodl and buy the dips it can't just reach that low.
And I estimate there's over a million strong hodlers in the world.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:39:24
Miners don't have much influence when the price is over 2000$
But if it's 500$ a few million dollar can influence the price, and those heavily invested in mining probably have some money elsewhere they can use for that.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:16:31
It can't just hit 100, if that's about to happen one individual can just buy it up until over 20% of the supply is in his hands.
But there's too many hodlers wanting to buy on dips for that either way

It depends a lot on the situation. Right now it's too early but in less than a century automation can do most human jobs and there might be a shitload of unemployment by then or miniscule wages. It would be nice if people had basic income to buy food and housing and get a job to pay for recreational activities.
It's in my opinion much better than raising the minimum wage.

You can't get -100% the second year, there will always be some demand for bitcoin unless the system is broken/cracked by quantum computers or something, which if ever possible would be decades a way, and bitcoin developers might find a solution before that.
If it goes +1000% and then -60% the next year it was still a good investment even if it was unstable. It's hard to determine tops and bottoms. But if you just buy some every month you're quite safe, especially if you think Bitcoin will go up in the longterm to over 100000$

I don't have the proof, or at least I don't care enough to search for it. It just never appeared to my wallet. You don't have to believe me really, I do not care about your money. I just want to warn you. But hey, they are smart thieves, they won't just steal anybodies money. Just don't take your BTC away in one go. They go for people who leave their site completely in one go.
@_date: 2015-06-07 17:29:18
I don't want people to believe me. I want people to be careful and learn from my mistake. And maybe that friend might have lied, idk. But I did experience it like how I told it. And I'm helping people by warning them. And you shouldn't just believe me, you should just take in mind that you can't trust anyone and always be careful with money and bitcoins. Even if I'm wrong and they didn't steal from me and something went wrong with the blockchain or whatever. They will have the possibility, as they  control your wallets on there.
If they ever happen to steal from you, please message me so I can laugh really hard and still feel bad for you.
@_date: 2015-06-07 08:36:53
Really, I don't care if you don't believe me. I just want to warn people to not make the same mistake. Just think about it, the minute you decide to take away all your bitcoins in one go, that it could possibly go wrong. There is no reason not to do it in steps. I feel stupid because I still kept using BTC-e, even though I've read about some guy claiming they stole from him.
And yes I accuse someone of a crime without having proof, you act like innocent until proven guilty is makes the accused totally innocent no matter what crime it did. I'm not fucking suing them, just saying what I've experienced. Do you think I'm lying or think I'm wrong? Why would I lie about something like that?
@_date: 2015-06-06 13:21:26
Never said they were better. It's just that you shouldn't trust this one either. Mr friend claims to lost 100000 dollar on here, and me about 2000 euros. They just didn't send my BTC to my wallet when I send everything back to my wallet.

Land is more expensive than UBI though, depending on how much.
Solo farming also seems inefficient. Also UBI doesn't make you rely on the government, it just helps. You're free to get a job and since some job competition is satisfied with UBI you'll easier get a job. Then you'll be able to afford a plot of land and do whatever you want.

I don't see how it's not a compromise.
People who want segwit get segwit, all they need to do is also increase the blocksize. People who want bigger blocks get bigger blocks, all they need to do is support segwit.
Even if you disagree with any change in blocksize, you could at least agree that this is a compromise.
And you say we ''NEED'' segwit. We don't need it, but Segwit is very useful and we should get it. I think 1 MB blocksize is too small too though, so I think we ''need'' bigger blocks. 
@_date: 2017-02-09 21:04:16
Well it's not that simple. If it went to 5000 I doubt it would go back to 700, maybe back to 1500 or something. But last time it went to 1200 it didn't go back to 100 either.
But then again, who knows, it might have been hit that low. But more importantly. By removing all the fake volume, the PBOC made bitcoin more transparent and a better investment.

I wouldn't really call all speculation gambling. But if you speculate about 10+ years in the future it's more of a gamble than a well thought speculation. You can't even speculate well on what gold will do in 10 years. Maybe there's a few stable things in the world, but most of it is far too hard to estimate.

Well the big difference here is that you also have to wipe your nose and I also have to eat lunch. If our hypothetical mother doesn't allow me to wipe my nose unless I also have lunch afterwards and there's this wet booger almost falling from your nose and mom also wants you to wipe your nose before you eat lunch then I'd say it's a compromise. We can both get what we want but we'll have to do something else too in return.
@_date: 2017-03-08 12:58:14
Much long-term impact? It would double the blocksize it forever right? Personally I think it's better to do a jump to 4MB/8MB + segwit. That way it's high enough for over a decade.
@_date: 2016-06-23 21:57:33
I'm completely aware. My argument is that the fees are not enough and that the  network hashrate WILL drop significantly some day because fees are not enough unless bitcoin becomes worth millions.
@_date: 2016-06-23 23:00:50
I'm probably not dead in 2060, and by then the blockreward is so small that transaction fees are more than half of the block.

Honestly, mining can still be profitable with the new  Antminer S9, aslong as you have free electricity and the bitcoin value doesn't go down.

2 GB graphics cards can still mine (for now), 4 GB is completely fine, you don't need 8 GB.
Ethash is designed to be ASIC-proof (because it's very memory intensive, this is what Litecoin tried to accomplish but it partly failed) so that there won't be huge (Chinese) companies with ASIC farms that control over half of the network hash. But lots of individuals with nice graphic cards can still mine profitable, or smaller companies just buying a lot of GPU, making it more decentralized. Although it will never be truly decentralized until Vitalik and the other co-founder die.

That's kinda disappointing actually, less than a million per BTC if all money was replaced, which is obviously not gonna happen, especially since there's more cryptocurrencies and because there's no good reason yet to stop using fiat completely.
But obviously the global economy is growing and so is the population, so who knows, one day.
@_date: 2017-01-11 21:11:22
Maybe not the masses, but lots young people who grow up with the internet don't watch as much as TV and some might be interested in this new form of money.

Even if it wasn't done on an exchange, it might be visible on the blockchain and if it's done transparently, people might simply buy more on exchanges at the same time
@_date: 2017-01-30 09:17:47
Often when the price is stable people are either keeping it low to buy or keeping it high to sell. I don't know which one it is right now. So I'll make sure I'll have some fiat to buy more in case it's the latter.
Honestly I hope it's the latter, longterm it will go to 100k, so I'd rather buy some cheap at 600 than at 900.
@_date: 2018-10-26 15:56:26
I'd say when the marketcap of Bitcoin reaches about 10% of the US Money Supply M2, which right now is about 14 trillion. So in 2018-2022 period, it would be overvalued at 1.4 trillion, so close to $80000 per BTC. However the global and US money supplies will continue to grow and inflation with continue too.

I'm not talking about me. I'm talking about ''people'' and I meant whales or groups of rich people who work together to indeed manipulate the price. If they keep it low, they can buy more cheaper over time. If they keep it high they can sell more for more over time.
It happens more with altcoins than with bitcoin, but sometimes even with Bitcoin it's kind of the case.

In defense of other cryptocurrencies without a limited supply. A small decreasing %inflation isn't as bad either, it's still better than a centralized regulated currency that can print/create as many as they need.
For example Ethereum, while inflation% will stay high for many years, in 50 years the % of total new coins per year will be quite low and will only get lower and lower the more time passes, but will never ever reach 0%. This means that even though the money supply will steadily increase, it won't increase AS MUCH as regulated currencies like USD and EUR, and not only will it be transparent and predictable, it will also decrease in %of total.
Now there's benefits and down sides to that. The downside is that it's less scarce than Bitcoin and will never get used as some Safe haven which gets worth more and more. But the upside is that miners will ALWAYS have incentive to keep mining, even when the transaction fee is low or when there's few transactions.
That is, if they will not switch to PoS..

I'm not saying it's likely. But if a democracy agreed that it should be banned they could still ban the use of bitcoin. They can arrest people who are found using it, they can shut down some exchanges. It's not impossible, just stupid and unliekly.

I think you're mistaken, if people refuse to sell (including spending) and instead hodl and buy, the price will go up nore than if people constantly sell (spend) and hodl less.
Hodling it gives it value too.
Spending isn't it's only usecase.
@_date: 2018-02-08 10:24:33
Why would you want some small dividends if you can have x10 in profit for just hodling for a a while? Some actually have this.

ETH and Lisk both don't give ownership of the platform, still made everyone a lot of ROI.
@_date: 2018-03-06 19:21:43
And you being in jail would still affect the price. 
I prefer relative freedom over jail, even if I have to sell my bitcoins.
Also if you just don't use them, but still remember the privatekey, you can hodl them even when banned. That's the most useful thing for bitcoin anyway, hodling. So if it gets banned they make not-selling even easier.
@_date: 2018-02-21 11:46:16
How does this scam work, I'm curious
@_date: 2018-02-13 20:44:16
If it is a bubble that means it should be poppable. The thing is, bitcoin will always have value (until billion of super quantum computers make private keys guessable). So it won't just pop, it is a store of value that will keep going up the more people in the world, the more money in the world and the more people know about it, with occasionally some corrections.
And what you're talking about sounds a lot like intrinsic value, people give  money value not because itself is valuable, but because others value. But the blockchain itself can be said to have intrinsic value, still, most of the value is because people give it value, and that's fine.
And I'm fine with bitcoin rising in value over time yes, it makes me money, gets value from the old rich to the younger generations who like technology and can finance lots of new things in the world.
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:02:35
I disagree with your last point, maybe it contributes some. But mostly  it is able to work because there are more ''greater fools'' that aren't really fools that are also speculating and hodling.  I think only around 5% or less of BTC is used for spending, so most of it is speculation, hodling and  trading.
It also doesn't have to be a currency for thousands of years, this is the new era, things move fast. It has been a currency for a few years, now it's already fine to be a store of value. The Lightning network is a nice extra that makes spending it more useful and I definitely would spend some of it, but it's still not nearly as important as hodling and speculating.
@_date: 2018-02-04 13:38:14
Well I think that if the trend reverses again that many people will join again. And many people who missed out last time will consider joining this time.

@_date: 2018-03-13 01:58:02

You probably never even read your privatekey, you just skimmed it.
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:21:42
That's not the only utility, but that's where most of the value comes from, if no one would use it to for buying stuff it would still be valuable simply because of this.
It's also great for permissionless transactions, great for sending transactions to someone else or over the internet. Great for buying illegal and expensive things on the internet.   
But people being able to be their own ''bank'', being able to escape from monetary inflation without having to go to the process of buying actual gold, is much more important than being able to buy things directly with bitcoin. 
Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have a lot of other uses, great for finance for example, for (anonymous) donations, for sending money abroad, for tax evasion and it's underlying blockchain can also be used for decentralization and verification of lots of processes. All these things add up, but I still think the vast majority comes from speculators, this is also why Satoshi never expected Bitcoin to be this valuable, he never realized speculators would love it so much, he wanted to give it value but didn't know it would be so valuable that transaction fees would shoot up to tens of dollars. Fortunately he knew that smarter people than him could improve it in the future and made sure it was possible to upgrade it.
@_date: 2018-02-13 22:42:25
Well it's simple, more and more people are introduced in bitcoin, more and more money is made in the world. People born now will grow up with bitcoin.
Sure there will be periods in which it goes down, especially after a huge pump like recently.  But generally people will continue to buy. It could be possible though that another cryptocurrency will one day take away too many buyers. Even so, at least for a while it will have more and more buyers.
One day it might decline, but there will always be some buyers as long as it works, once the prices goes below $500, there will be people who will try to buy as much as possible in the hopes of it going back up.

Yes it's completely fine, as long as the value goes up and people don't need permission from a third party to make transactions I'm happpy.
I love bitcoin as a genius system, but I just speculate it will go up in value simply because more speculators/hodlers will join, in addition to some small amount of people who use it to buy stuff.

I don't know the bot haha. Sounds useful.

Yeah one time I got really lucky on liqui.io. EDG was trading 40% lower than on Bittrex, bought as much as I could, not that I had much BTC there.

If it's not used for transactions it can still be desirable, that's my point. Most of the desire is speculative, hodling and just wanting to own bitcoins. The spending isn't the desire. Bitcoin is also useful for transactions abroad, but mostly it's better to hodl than buy some things below $50 with it. The network effect isn't as important as the hodling effect. Gold is also extremely valauble because people hodl it, states do, people do, gold jewelry is like a device to hodl gold like a ledger is for bitcoin, except that you can show it off better, there's no need to constantly spend godl.
I'm using bitcoin by hodling it, as long as I hold it's ''temporary'' effect on the price is good/  And I agree it's default and established, but also very important is the distribution, other coins started with big miners, ICO's or other unfair distribution. Not counting Satoshi's stash, bitcoin has the best distribution.

I know I don't get dividends and whatever but I participated in many ICO's and most of them were profitable for me. I think with VCs the profit rate is much lower.

The problem is however that because the vote was "illegal" lots of people, mainly people against independence, boycotted the vote. Which kind of ruined the votes results.
I think they should just do a revote with supervision of a neutral state like Australia or something.

It's different with Brexit and Trump because pretty much everyone agrees that those were legal elections.
Not voting in a normal referendum and not voting in an illegal referendum  is a big difference. If any local government can cast a referendum but 90% abstains for several reasons the the results of such referenda shouldn't be taken at face value.

What are they gonna do, take away all the euros with force? Maybe they won't be able to print anymore, but any country is free to accept the euro.
Then again, being in control of the money supply is worth it so they should start a new currency.

You do realize that people who short bitcoin pay interest fees to hodlers (who lend it out) and sell us bitcoin on discount. We should thank them instead and then liquidate them anyway.

It acttually matters a lot what causes the BTC price to change.
If it's external, like China or another country banning something. Then alts will go down. But if it's blockchain related, then it's very possible that alts will go up, because if bitcoin will fail or have a fork problem or community split, there's finally a chance for another altcoin to become  and you see that with such situations people will hedge with alts.

Sure it did change and probably improve the world a lot. But it's nothing compared to what AI could do (although I guess the space race indirectly sped up AI research). It will centralize power even more so and can drastically change world politics .

It's actually much less conspiracy like.
Winklevoss don't need to know some secret we don't know. They just realize why Bitcoin is going to at least $500k because of reasons commonly known by other experts and speculators.  The average redditor doesn't know these things though, but it's not some secret knowledge.

It can't pop that quickly after huge correction just 10 years ago. It would need to be at least triple last time's peaks before it's big enough to pop, which will probably take at least 2 decades.  Besides, with constant USD inflation, bitcoin isn't the only thing that will increase in price. Properties and land will too. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 10:51:22
But no one would think the price will keep going down, the moment it hits too low, suddenly a lot of people will want to buy, and others know this too. Every dip theres thousands of people buying more.
But I guess it's true, if it goes too high, people will sell, and that happens everytime, it went too high in december and then they sold, so I guess one day it will stop going higher, just don't think that's near yet. I think it will be around gold marketcap or sligtly higher than that.

I spend a small part of BTC. It's not a good time to spend though. I prefer spending after a nice bullrun.

Isn't he the guy that got tricked by Craig Wright? He must feel embarrased by that
@_date: 2016-10-26 06:28:56
but I've been waiting for over 10 hours for 3 transactions. How fast do high fee transactions get confirmed? 2 minutes?
@_date: 2016-10-26 06:17:32
Oh so I'm not the only one with 4 unconfirmed transactions
@_date: 2016-10-26 06:22:19
I'm also waiting for over 10 hours for a few transactions today
Here's one of them 
I used a slightly higher fee than my wallet recommended, which is a 65 satoshi per byte

But generally, people are becoming more tech savy over time. Old people who don't understand are dying and the vast majority of people born today all over the world will have access to internet , and many of them have it growing up, so demand will most likely increase over time unless something happens.
@_date: 2016-10-27 16:41:06
I'm not talking about average block time, I'm talking about average transaction time. Isn't the average TRANSACTION time also around 10 minutes as seen in this link?

Well if someone's buying in 5$s they probably put hundreds of dollars in an exchange and buy them everyday and move them once in a week/month/whoknows or even keeps them there
@_date: 2016-10-27 16:42:49
And hundreds uninformed people like me don't use the right fee. To compensate for the hundreds, there must be transactions faster than 10 minutes or else the average will be above 10 minutes right?
@_date: 2016-10-26 06:29:35
Yea I wasn't aware I had to be paying that much, I guess I shouldn't listen to my wallet and go to the  website everytime I want to send a transaction or keep up a little.
But how can I like cancel them and send them again?

Bitcoin is not an entirely binary bet. Why would it ever be worth $0??? There will always be people who give it value.
@_date: 2015-11-26 10:49:08
If they were, they would actually be easier to find.
@_date: 2016-10-26 07:40:39
On average 10 minutes, so if mine take 10 hours, someone must be getting some fast as fuck transactions to average it out to 10
@_date: 2016-05-31 12:34:26
And you think a network breach is possible in something like this? Chances are more likely that all of internet fails than bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-07-07 09:51:56
Who knows we might get an average blocktime  of 11 minutes instead of 10 for a week or 2. But that's not the end of the world
