Your insults are almost as bad as your investment strategy.

Wow this is great news for all 7 of New York's bitcoiners!

So I guess gold being a corrosion resistant, highly conductive, and highly useful metal for electronics is not relevant because reasons?  Much of gold's value is speculative, but there's definitely a use for the product, and an intrinsic value.  If people stop thinking bitcoin has value overnight, it drops to 0 and serves no other purpose.  At least gold will be used in electronics and jewelry and therefore still has value.  
But w/e keep telling yourself what you want to hear.  Just like religion, the thing most of you neck beards despise, if you repeat lies enough your flock will buy into it.  So keep repeating your same mantra as the bitcoin price continues to tumble towards 0.

Garage?  This is a bitcoin business sir, it's running from a basement.  A garage is for a successful bitcoin business.  Eventually you can move up to a gutted out warehouse and put all your gear on factory shelving with no fire suppression and call it a datacenter.  But that's only if you are very successful.

Jesus christ the amount of mental gymnastics to say some shit like that is incredible.  


That's just a horribly stupid statement in order for you to justify your investing in the correct combination of electrical impulses (aka bullshit).  The fact is you could apply that horribly misguided, delusional, and misleading statement to any asset in the world and claim it has no intrinsic value.  There is going to be books written about the collective denial of bitcoiners.  Well there is, it's called Bitcon: The naked truth of bitcoin, but there will be plenty more to come about your cult.  Congrats, you'll go mainstream, but it won't be as a currency.

Ok, so those are world statistics.  They include Africans in refugee camps.  They include tribes throwing spears in South America.  According to those statistics, if you have a job in the United States, you are probably among the 1% richest people in the world.  I believe if you make over 30k a year you'd be the top 1% richest in the world with those numbers.
I am using numbers from within my country, the U.S, not the entire world.  And the numbers are not wrong.  The U.S has a bad wealth inequality situation, and bitcoin is so bad it makes the situation in the U.S look ideal.

If bitcoin's main purpose (being your own bank) is designed around an inherent human flaw, it becomes bitcoin's problem.  You can keep repeating the same old mantra of "it's not bitcoin's fault" till you are blue in the face.  Doesn't change the fact that it is in fact bitcoin's fault.  Nor will a consumer care why their money is missing, they will simply blame bitcoin and never touch it again.  So maybe instead of taking the pretentious route that bitcoin is perfect, you can take the humble route and seek solutions.  But I guess solutions come from developers, not teenage cultists who post memes all day.

My account is only 1 day old too.  Imagine how many times you will upvote me in the next year.  I smell an exponential trend (100% increase in just one day)!  I think someone should bust out a log chart and plot my account's success because it's going tooo theee moooon!

Well said, I can't wait until bitcoin dominates the world and the bitcoin foundation becomes defacto kings.  I think they will do a much better job of governing the populace.  What's that, the bitcoin foundation was originally founded by 50% felons and is now running out of user donated money?  Oh nvm then!

You're right, it's an infinite increase, proving that the moon is just a pit stop.  Mars, here I come to setup the [first martian side chain!](  To mars!

Not a single dollar of new money has entered the system in an entire year.  If it has, it's just replacing users who are leaving.  Either way, no, a stagnant transaction volume is NOT a sign of a health economy in any way shape or form.  It's a sign of a loss of interest, no matter how you slice it.  But don't mind me, just load up the transactions per day which has been steadily increasing and stick your fingers in your ears.  That should solve the problem!

So giving an ID is more invasive than giving Coinbase your bank account info, address, name, and last four digits of SSN? 
Or how about a bitcoin ATM asking for finger prints, ID, picture of face, and name?  
Oh my bad you were about to climax?  I'll let you guys get back to it.

Why not?  If you compare wealth inequality in bitcoin to fiat, the disparity is so high that it actually makes it look like fiat solved the problem.  Bitcoin wealth inequality is so high that it's worse than 3rd world dictatorships. 
In the U.S the top 1% which would be over 3 million different people own 34%.  In bitcoin 47 people own 28%.  You couldn't possibly have a worse situation if you tried.  People like Roger Ver, Satoshi, and the twins would be the richest people to have walked the planet.

5% of the world's money is physical cash, the rest is digital.  Op has no clue what he's talking about...so by my calculations this will be the  trending story on this sub very shortly.

Is this the same network effect that allowed bitcoin to have a total of under 1 million users in 6 years?  Cause real network effect such as HTTP with 71 million users in 6 years, or Paypal with over 1 million users in 18 months have real network effect.  Take one look at the transaction volume USD for bitcoin and we can see it's 100% horizontal line.  No new money in the network for an entire year, that's not  sign of network effect, that's the sign of a loss of interest.
