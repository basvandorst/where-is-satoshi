If you don’t know how to do it confidently. I wouldn't try it. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 20:06:16

Only $40 to buy the software to double you bitcoin. Anonymously.
SOUNDS PROMISING. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:41:48
The whole point of the seed is to be able to recover. I'm holding a wallet with some BTC that i cant recover  because of a lost passwords.
The question is ? Is it safe to split up the Seeds. IE is it trivial to hack the next 6 words of a seed if you know the first six?

You know what would be really cool. If there was some nice music streaming over the top of the chart. ��

No doubt Roger Ver has done a lot for the Bitcoin community. But this sequence from a bitcoin documentary always seems m to me to be over the top and affected.

Never write down addresses. Always copy and paste. Write down your seeds from your wallet and keep in a secure place.

I have  a Trezor. I can recommend it.

So is the bitcoin going into the hole or emerging from it.
@_date: 2019-04-27 20:23:13
That's a bitcoin cow. Not a bull.

When an article about segregated witness is incorrectly called separate witness. You probably don't need to read.

Great service. Voorhees has done a stellar job for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

This sounds 16.5% scammy?
@_date: 2017-09-05 09:21:39
Spend what you can afford to lose. It goes up in value because it's rare and people want it.
You retain ownership by always having control over your private keys. That is you keep you private keys in a wallet that only you have access to. Make sure everything is backed up.
Good luck. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 10:22:30
That wasn't much of a fight! 
@_date: 2017-09-03 10:34:39

Deadly you still have to remember high entropy passwords. Keep a paper backup is a secure location. 
I have ever 16.9 btc in a password protected wallet. 
I feel so stupid for not writing down my password. 
Remember a stong password written down is better than a weak password remembered.

You wont be able to just move from the usb to the ledger. You will need to send them. That will involve setting up a wallet. Taking the wallet. dat file from the usb and putting it into the wallet. Then set up your ledger. Then send the Bitcoin from wallet to ledger. I would send a small amount first as a test. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 08:38:47
Too Good! 
@_date: 2018-04-12 19:13:45

Where can I download the app? 
@_date: 2017-05-29 02:03:42
Best practice is not to leave it on an exchange. Get your own bitcoin wallet. Electrum or Jaxx. Whatever you are comfortable with. Backup your wallet. Keep your bitcoin there. Ideally you should have a clean dedicated computer also. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 01:58:29
Nothing to stop you. But what traditionally holds people up is not being able to cash out of the other exchange.
