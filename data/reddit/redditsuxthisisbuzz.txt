@_date: 2019-08-02 17:47:02
man, i'm getting so far , but then completely stumped :P  
is there -any- significance to the numbers in the green block?   and to the colored dots above the 51 rectangles?
@_date: 2019-08-07 09:12:57

@_date: 2019-08-02 23:25:16

@_date: 2019-08-03 00:19:42

@_date: 2019-08-02 17:49:36
yes, the one covered by the hand of the mannequin
@_date: 2019-08-03 00:07:30
well, bunch of different methods could be applied  
i'm a endless overthinker, just carry along all the options of previous ideas ;)
@_date: 2019-08-04 13:54:52
there was no meaning in those dots

[**The order**]( of [**operations**]( in math-- Parentheis, Exponents, Multiplication, [**Division**]( Addition, Subtraction

@_date: 2019-08-02 18:03:23
ah, there's no significance to 16-15-16-15 , tnx

@_date: 2019-08-02 17:51:21

10:37:38 &lt; buZz&gt; why not add a usecase to your description  
10:37:44 &lt; buZz&gt; or a listing of benefits for users  
10:37:56 &lt; buZz&gt; or a description of the actual problem you are trying to solve with it  
10:38:28 &lt; vjy&gt; That's a good question.. :)
@_date: 2019-12-25 08:51:07
you forgot to link to the store, dufus
@_date: 2019-12-13 11:43:40
that was a description, no usecase, no benefits, no problem description
@_date: 2018-12-10 23:54:58
