I would define taking an original products' name, creating a separate product (with a different philosophy for the future and direction etc.,) and marketing the separate product as the original products name to confuse entry level market participants, whilst trying to convince the market participants that the original product should be called something else, as malicious intent. This does not sound like doing business in good faith.

I never said I agreed with everything he said. EDIT: but before I listened to what he had to say, I never really considered the inherent value of fiat currency, I always just took it for granted. I learnt about monetary policy, and the flaws of low interest rates and endless QE because of some of his ideas.

If you have something against RT and Infowars that's fair, they have spread disinfo numerous times, usually hidden amongst certain truths. But some mainstream media can be just as bad. Like CNN giving Hilary the questions before a debate, or the WSJ saying the SEC was investigating ETH lol. I understand your reservedness about those particular media outlets but the more you dig with regards to the general media as a whole the worse it gets. IMO you should disregard what platform people say stuff on and just focus on the stuff being said. Out of curiosity, was it his foreign or domestic policy you thought was potentially harmful to the US?

Didnt you have like 3 referendums in a row to do with the lisbon treaty or something where the EU refused to accept your answer until you voted the correct way? Not being snarky the details are genuinely vague for me

Just so I'm not mistaken, did you keep all your funds in Coinbase for the 5-6 months you've been trading, and only recently moved them to a hardware wallet? Or did you regularly move your funds out of Coinbase into a software wallet only you have the private keys for? May I ask which wallet you use? Thanks

it is around 1900 usd per day rise.
btc roughly 5k right now.
522 days until 1 million. 1 million - 5000 = 995,000
995000 / 522 = 1906

been out for 10 years and it doesn't scale so not really sure it counts as a monetary system? You have to be able to actually transact with a money system lol
@_date: 2018-11-27 12:52:06
when you have rampant market manipulation, a literal fake dollar (USDT) with no proof of usd funds being used as the backbone of BTC trading, a disgusting ICO space (just look at r/ICOAnalysis), fork after fork and hash wars, no effective scaling (yet) and a flawed deflationary model of currency, can you really blame them? Just look at the all time graph of BTC. To normal people and investors, who like to hedge and diversify, they would look at all of this and think "not for me, thanks". To be fair, your point is more about uninformed criticism, which is really understandable. They are uninformed. But I have plenty of discussion with skeptics who know enough to criticize bitcoin properly

when the network is congested, good luck trying to buy a coffee for a cheap transaction fee, something that a "monetary system" has to actually allow! Guess what is great about fiat? It can actually be used as a "monetary system"

If whales were buying they would be driving the price up because more buy orders than sell orders, calling them whales implies they have a lot of volume and purchasing power so they would inevitably drive the price up, trading 101 come on people
