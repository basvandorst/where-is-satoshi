This doesn't actually make things any more decentralised.
That's like saying you want to decentralise mining by making sure there's at least five people who live at the mining centre that controls 55% of the hashing power - it's still a central point of failure even if there's more people involved.
The real way to decentralise development is to have alternative node clients running to Bitcoin Core.

No, the fewer people mine a chain, the LESS profitable it is for the miners because the value of the coin plummets with the decreased security and no-one pays transaction fees.
Is more money made every day in Bitcoin mining, or in Scamcoin23 mining?
If you wanted to start mining, you might decide to get into Bitcoin mining because you were serious, or Scamcoin23 mining because you wanted to have some fun, but you wouldn't start mining Scamcoin23 to make a profit because there's zero possibility it ever gains any real value.


While no doubt it makes sense to you in theory that there will always be one holdout on the losing chain, and maybe there would be, in practice no-one cares if three loonies have their own "Original Bitcoin" which is totally valueless.  If 60% of the economy moves onto a new chain, that rapidly snowballs to 99.99999% and while technically there might not be abandonment of the chain in the sense that maybe at least one person still mines it, it becomes close enough as makes no difference.

You're right that because the code is open source the "original chain" cannot and will never be forcibly "destroyed".


Or everyone will see which way the balance is tipping, sell all of Losing Coin to buy Winning Coin, and Losing Coin will be worthless and no-one will bother facilitating the use of coins on either chain since only Winning Coin will matter.
So no one will be "forced" to stop mining the losing chain by way of the code being hidden or anything, but they will anyway once it's no longer profitable.

So why would you sell out of Bitcoin before it's yet-to-be-invented successor even exists?
Let me give you a hint, if something better than Bitcoin is invented, I *guarantee* the FIRST asset it will trade against is Bitcoin. There will be a [NEW ASSET] / Bitcoin markets within hours of its invention, and it would be years before it would trade against even the largest of fiat currencies.
If you need proof of this, look at the altcoin market.  Every one trades against Bitcoin almost as soon as it's invented, some of the larger ones sometimes trade against Litecoin and that's it. None of them trade for USD, except occassionally Litecoin which is  of several thousand and has been around for years.
If you think there will be a successor to Bitcoin and you want to be the earliest to get into it, the only logical move is to hold Bitcoin in preparation.  As an added bonus, in the more likely case that this revolutionary technology doesn't arrive so soon after Bitcoin itself, you benefit from the growing wave of Bitcoin adoption instead.
Edit: This is all beside the point anyway.  Your original analogy to social networks is clearly flawed and irrelevant as explained here:

Users have been doing basically the reddit equivalent of rioting for months with essentially no concessions from the moderators and you're *surprised* that some people have resorted to extreme all-or-nothing opinions?


You're simultaneously dismissing the possibility of substantial change (needed to combat this "unhealthy" atmosphere) as well as ruling out some kind of smaller "project" because users can't be "objective".
In both cases, you're essentially blaming users' rather justified response to the ridiculous censorship for the moderation team's own intractable policies which are the actual root cause of the problem.
Quickest way to make the atmosphere less "unhealthy" and users more "objective" is to remove Theymos as mod and announce an end to draconian censorship.
You will find things return to what you would probably describe as a "more reasonable" comment section very quickly, but can't complain about people being "unreasonable" until and unless that is done.

The point is that there's a minimum floor for spending that ensures the economy is not going to grind to a complete halt with an appreciating currency.  I frequently see somewhat hyperbolic panic about "oh no, if everyone's currency went up in value then literally no one would spend anything ever and we'd all live in cardboard boxes and eat museli all day to hoard our cash, sounds like a great life and economy! /s" that is super unreasonable and obviously missing the point.
People have other inbuilt mechanisms that ensure they will spend money on non-essentials even in this environment, such as boredom. They will however be slightly more circumspect about buying pure crap.
The opposite is not as true, where there isn't really any checks on maximum spending with a depreciating currency.  Many people will spend all of their money on crap they don't really need or even want that much (or invest in something that isn't that great), because it's better than doing nothing.
In fact it goes further then that, where many people will spend *more money than they even have*, which isn't impossible thanks to this trick called "debt".  Many people get stuck in a cycle of virtually guaranteed and unbreakable poverty because not only do they have less than zero money, they're constantly moving further and further below being worthless (what an insane concept) thanks to interest payments.

There's not many of these people, and they'd still need a motivation to crash Bitcoin.  In the absence of anyone actively trying this, it can be safely ignored.


This is beyond ridiculous.  Of course you can't prove a negative. You also can't prove that circumstances might exist that cause the entire Bitcoin network to self-combust at the exact same moment, but the sky isn't falling because of that either. Why? It's 99.999999999999999999999%+ not going to happen, and is and should be totally excluded from practical considerations in reality.
Otherwise you get analysis paralysis.  I hope your life doesn't revolve around considering every possible set of circumstances and accounting for them equally, because that's just stupid.  You prioritise the realistic and/or important ones.

If you're uncomortable with the exchange rate volatility, that just means **you** have too much invested for your risk tolerance and personal portfolio. It has nothing to do with Bitcoin.
Skyrocketing prices for bitcoin are fantastic.  Not only does it get massive amounts of free publicity, it indicates increasing liquidity and investor confidence (both of which it actually does need).
If you're not convinced, consider two cases:
1. Bitcoin meanders along and is still worth around $500 / coin in two year's time.
2. Bitcoin succeeds wildly and is worth $50 000 / coin in two years time.
Which is a better outcome for Bitcoin and all its investors (including you)? Which would require more volatility?
The answer is the latter in both cases.

Because he's a well-known endless contrarian, and like usual will grasp at any straw possible in a snarky effort to talk down about Bitcoin.
In this case, he's trying to dismiss the importance of PhDs being written about Bitcoin.
I will probably fall out of my chair on the day that rydan positively acknowledges a single thing that could possibly indicate Bitcoin is not a total failure that everyone hates.
He's running out of corners to hide though, because nowadays the condescension mostly comes down to "Bitcoin's so everyday, unremarkable and average" (as seen above, it shouldn't be at all noteworthy that anyone has/will write a PhD *about Bitcoin*). This was ironically the stage that Bitcoin was previously forecast to never achieve, it was instead going to collapse under the weight of wasted energy/negative publicity/price death spiral/misaligned mining incentives/yadda yadda in a spectacular fireball. It didn't.

There is so much wrong in this comment.
If you have two blockchains, the miners are split on each chain. It's not profitable for them to risk 50/50 on each, so they'll tend to be aligned more to one chain or the other, and once one has even a marginal edge it will snowball to be the one all the others are on too.
This process happens with the miners at the exact same time as exchanges, merchants, processing companies etc. also realise they should be on one side or the other.  They prefer to strongly favour one chain over the other, and they don't care which as long as they're on the winning one.
This is all amplified by the investors, who will see miners/other parts of the ecosystem/liquidity sloshing to one side or the other and then can make bank on selling on the obvious loser and buying on the obvious winner.
TL:DR; There is one and only one blockchain (that's literally the entire point of its invention).  If there are two competing block chains, one will win out over the other very quickly.

Story that aired tonight on Dark Net Markets on the very mainstream 7.30 Report (right after the news) on government run ABC in Australia.
Bitcoin not mentioned by name, but did sneak in to some of the screenshots of the Silk Road.  Honestly I think this is a very fair piece, despite the obligatory “scare tactic” moment with the one guy who died from a drug overdose and Ross hiring hit men to keep his operation together.
There’s plenty of acknowledgement that the government’s foolproof plan to kill the dark net by nabbing Silk Road just spawned more heads on the hydra, and even that the peer-reviewed free market drug dealers are operating in requires them to “compete for customers” (shock horror).

Why change what you're doing? Ask your boss to pay you in Bitcoin, or if you're self-employed start accepting it directly as payment (perhaps with a discount to incentivise people to spend it or acquire some).

The whole point is that Bitcoin stands on its own, with or without the involvement of any particular person.


I would not say there's "widespread acceptance" of that at all.  But "Satoshi" clearly existed, whether as an individual or a collective.


No. And no.
It makes perfect sense that Bitcoin the cryptographic, privacy protecting, anti-government currency would be invented by someone who valued anonymity and knew how to protect it. If I were the world's largest holder of Bitcoin I wouldn't go announcing it to the world either.

There are some attacks that can be done with a majority of malicious nodes right?

@_date: 2015-06-15 12:56:00
However, no other node is going to listen to it. So it doesn't matter what code you're running on your one node, so long as at least 50% of the mining network and 50% of the node network are honest.
Everyone on the network is incentivised to hold to the limit, and no-one can afford to cheat unless enough other people cheat.  But each cheater wants to cheat for their benefit, and not that of the other cheaters.  Cheaters prefer continued honest consensus to benefiting another cheater but not themselves.  So the honest majority always wins out.

What is Coinbase going to simultaneously run "CoinbaseForBitcoinA.com" (which could be traded on "Btc-eForBitcoinA.com") and "CoinbaseForBitcoinB.com" (which could be traded on "Btc-eForBitcoinB.com" but not "Btc-eForBitcoinA.com")? This is so ludicrous I can't believe I'd have to explain to you why this wouldn't happen.
The whole point of money is that it is liquid and fungible, which both rely on the network effect. Two competing forms of nearly identical money, like two forks of Bitcoin will turn into one with incredible rapidity.


Yes, that's THE blockchain.


Go ahead, start your own unsecured fork of Bitcoin and see how many people you can convince to trade the coins for real goods and services or even any other currency (especially real Bitcoins).  That will be all the proof that there is only one Bitcoin you will ever need.

Then you have at least 10 years for Moore's law to work, plus time to develop other solutions.
People against the block size increase often seem to use this "it's just kicking the can down the road" argument. Of course it is, but if it's between a pretty reasonable kick with more solutions and hardware improvements in the pipeline and doing nothing and starting a bunch of problems I'd pick the former. 
People arguing against don't seem to have any solution beyond "Well, it's fine how it is right now. Change has some minor risks and isn't immediately necessary." which is about the most shortsighted view possible from a group of people invested in a currency which requires incredible foresight to believe in.

Months and months of having posts unreasonably censored, mods receiving hundreds of downvotes, constant threads saying "why can't we discuss or change the rules here" and even this very thread, the front page "Can I set this sub to display banned posts by default somehow please?" is obviously a little more notable than a temporary 2 year old type tantrum.


Of course it will accomplish nothing, they know that. Which is exactly why it's only going to get more intense and people are going to adopt more and more extreme views out of frustration. And you then use those people as justification not to do anything, perpetuating the cycle.
I think you need to take a long, hard look in the mirror and ask yourself why its ok to point-blank refuse to adapt to the community's wishes in the face of constant, overwhelming and increasingly justified feedback that you should.
It's beyond ridiculous that censorship is apparently now an acceptable component of a movement based on freedom from control.

When you say "quickly settling", what you mean is several years of discussion.
The two are not mutually exclusive.  A dynamic cap could be added later, from a 20mb base or replacing that 20mb base.
The problem is that even with just two proposals:
1. Increase the cap, to 20mb
2. Don't increase the cap.
there has been a metric shit ton of back and forth and hemming and hawwing.
If you expand the options to three or more, such as:
1. Increase the cap, to 20mb
3. Increase the cap, to some flexible scaling sort of proposal.  Exactly what requires a secondary round of "I like this. No I prefer that."
4. Don't increase the cap.
then chances of ANYTHING happening are even less.  We're already struggling with two choices, adding more is not going to make the situation better.
If you support an increase (of one kind or another), you should support the increase most likely / supported to solve the problem for the immediate future and then discuss ways that this could be better implemented.
If a lot of people support the increase, but everyone wants their own method of increasing and not any of the others, then "no increase" ends up being what happens.  Even if most people support an increase.
The most supported increase change is 20MB by far, even if a substantial minority think some kind of more complicated scaling would be better (although the scaling people can't even come up with a consensus among themselves what kind of scaling, so I don't understand how they think they can convince the 20mb and no change crowds if they can't even agree among themselves).

It's not though.  You are an example of this, you said above that you want an increase but don't think 20mb is the way to go.  Your alternative proposal was vague as all hell, and unlikely to be coded and a viable option anyway, yet you still think that's better than the actually possible 20mb.

They would, if their only incentive was to maximise transaction fees.
However, not processing transactions as fast as possible decreases the utility of the Bitcoin network and so the price of Bitcoin, and given the mining reward is still substantial they prefer to keep a high price to the Bitcoin they are rewarded with each block over picking up a tiny bit of extra transaction fees.

Just to add to this answer, along with mining being self-correcting, it can also be "delayed-profitable".

Exactly, because Snapchat is an *application* and Bitcoin is a *technology*, that's my point.  Just like sex shops and Apple, they're not even in the same league.  So Bitcoin has slower growth than Snapchat, but faster growth than other technologies, like cars or the internet.
This discussion is obviously not going to be any more fruitful, we'll just have to agree to disagree.  I think Bitcoin is on track to completely transform the world, and you think it's some mildly interesting development in computer science that will undoubtedly be replaced by a better version if it even kicks on at all.
The numbers I'm looking at are like these ones:

On every metric that I can see mattering, eg. users and price, Bitcoin is exploding.


Nope, it's going to be Bitcoin.


Absolutely it's a crappy currency.  But it's becoming an amazing store of value (exponential growth on multi year time frames) and an even better payment platform (instant, almost free, global transfer with no registration).  It'll become a good currency as time goes on and adoption continues to grow, liquidity continues to increases and volatility continues to decrease.
In any case, best of luck and maybe hindsight will indicate one of us as being shortsighted and the other not.

I don't know much about economics, but I don't put much stock in peer review and recognition by the establishment when it comes to something like Bitcoin.  It doesn't fit existing models, and "mainstream", "recognized" experts like Professor Bitcorn and Paul Krugman, even Warren Buffet, are clearly not even properly appraised on Bitcoin, let alone to be taken as authorities.
Not only is it an invention the likes of which the world has never seen, but it falls in a very narrow blend of technology, economics and sociology and there aren't many people who I would give enough weight on all subjects to consider their opinion relevant on a combination.

How "good" something is as a store of value depends on your time frame.

There has been thousands of times in history that the "established consensus" has been proven incorrect.  In fact, something revolutionary **requires** mass skepticism or it wouldn't be groundbreaking.
What I do understand is that the free market has been growing Bitcoin at a pace probably faster than any other technology ever in history.  If the pseudo-science of economics (look into it, there's several "schools of thought" and constant argument about anything more than the very basics) doesn't agree with the market, I'm going to go with the market.

No, there isn't a chance that Bitcoin settles at any value until it either has replaced existing currencies as much as it possibly can or it becomes useless (whether replaced by another crypto currency or some flaw is found or whatever).
* The value of a currency is very largely predicated on its liquidity (how much value you can transact without changing its worth - roughly equivalent to adoption)
* The only reason the entire world is not already using the USD (the most liquid currency) is because of government-enforced arbitrary geographic areas that require the local currency, backed by guns (proof-of-violence)
* Bitcoin is not subject to country boundaries
* Bitcoin is growing against the USD, despite how many orders of magnitude its liquidity is lower
* We can conclude that Bitcoin's attributes make it superior to the USD, in spite of inferior liquidity
* As Bitcoin grows, the liquidity issue becomes ever smaller in a snowball effect, until it starts to slide in Bitcoin's favour rather than against it
* There is no point at which the Bitcoin economy or user base should "stop" growing until it has replaced most fiat currency
* There are technological scalability issues with Bitcoin currently, but no social or economic reasons (near infinite divisibility).  The technological reasons are being solved as fast as they can, and are the only thing besides adoption preventing Bitcoin from being the world standard.
It should be understood that "USD" can be replaced with any other government issued currency in the above analysis and reach the same conclusion.
TLDR; Liquidity is the most valuable attribute of a currency.  Bitcoin is growing despite low liquidity, so it's a downhill, not uphill battle.  Moon or bust.

I understand why you can't just try private keys until you find a public key with funds, but if this is an already matched list of private and public keys can you just find a public key with funds, then look up the private key?

Bitcoin + all alt coins go through bubble cycles.  This is due to human psychology.  At the moment we are towards the end of one of Bitcoin's bubble cycles, which is why the graphs looks like... a bubble.
Don't believe me? (Get Reddit Enhancement Suite "RES" if you don't have it, makes image viewing so much easier)
[Sep 2010 - Dec 2010, Bitcoin $0.05 &gt; $0.40 &gt; $0.20](
[Jan - June 2011, Bitcoin $2 &gt; $30 &gt; $15](
[Jan - June 2013, Bitcoin $20 &gt; $220 &gt; $120](
[Sep 2013 - Dec 2014, Bitcoin $100 &gt; $1200 &gt; $300](
Still worried about that graph?
The difference is that alt coins bubble once or twice maximum, and at best provide some experimentation on crypto technology. 
Bitcoin actually is gaining adoption, real world usage and opening new practical possibilities for solving real world problems. If Microsoft accepting Bitcoin or the recent ESPN broadcast of the Bitcoin bowl won't convince you of that, then I don't know what will.
If you want to understand this process more, take a look at the historical trend of Bitcoin vs. combined market cap of every other alt coin.  Bitcoin is trending up, as it absorbs/outstrips the other coins.  
I couldn't find a good graph of that, so as a proxy lets use just [BTC/LTC]( this graph wouldn't be very different with every single other alt coin included.  Basically the alt coins rise as Bitcoin spikes &gt; new investors/money pour into the space and by association all the altcoins &gt; alt coin then trends consistently down against Bitcoin until the next bubble.

It'd be much simpler and likely effective to just market Bitcoin better, than try create a pseudo-Bitcoin which you then somehow sell as having all of Bitcoin's advantages without acknowledging that it's basically the same thing and has all the same drawbacks plus a bunch from being just one company's efforts rather than a whole community.

The first time someone hears about a company accepting Bitcoin, they think "what is Bitcoin?".
The second time they think "that's cool I remember reading about bitcoin."
The fifth time they think "Shit, this is a big deal, I really should very carefully investigate getting some."
Microsoft is a big deal because it is globally recognized and trusted, plus likely to generate additional media coverage, so the number of people having a "time hearing about Bitcoin" is enormous.  A lot of those people are going to buy some Bitcoin for the first time.


There's no hoping, but actual action.  In this case, BitPay working with Microsoft to have them accept it, which inevitably leads to people giving it another look.
There is plenty of focus on making Bitcoin itself better.  There is also plenty of focus on spreading it to new people.  Of course more of both would be better, but I don't think the ratio of focus is too heavily split to either side.

You're right actually.
On the [address summary page]( it shows transactions with 0 value.  I mistook this to mean the inputs came out as fees, when I think it's just displayed wrong.
But on the page for [an individual transaction]( it shows a positive value transaction and no fee.
Might be a bug with Blockchain.  The no fee is how it shows up [on Blockr](
Still rather odd that this address is just constantly spamming itself.
Edit:  It appears Blockchain.info is bugging out, latest solved blocks [on the home page]( were solved four hours ago.  Behind about 26 blocks at the moment.

Not profitable, miners switch off, difficulty drops, profitability happens again.  A balance is found.
Although in the end maybe a lot of miners will run at break-even sponsored by larger company providers that get a benefit out of access to a mining pool for critical transactions (like taking money out of an exchange cold wallet).  Seems unlikely that one entity would come to dominate it, as not only would the community lash back be huge (or they'd migrate to something else) but the expenditure on un profitable mining would be a handicap that gave smaller competitors an advantage.

As for fiat, I haven't done it for a while, but what I understand is you can either send a risky bank wire somewhere into Serbia (I have a friend that did this and had no problems besides a month's delay, ymmv).  Or you can try get fiat in at a ridiculous mark up through one of the other services like Liqpay or OKCash or whatever they're called.  This will be expensive and likely involve dealing with support staff somewhere in Russia.

Solved the [Byzantine General's Problem](  For the first time in history, a group of people who are only self interested, have never met and don't trust each other can make an unbreakable agreement.
This has allowed for the creation of the first ever scarce digital asset (Bitcoin), plus the potential for a million other applications based on the principle of distributed agreement.
Distributed systems are much harder to shut down, much harder to censor and *in some cases* much more efficient than centralised systems.


Blockchain bloat is a relatively minor problem at the moment, with [solutions already being implemented](
Having additional information inside the blockchain is good, because the security of the blockchain depends on Bitcoin being valuable.  Bitcoin being valuable depends on both adoption, utility and liquidity.
It doesn't matter what someone is using the blockchain for (storing information, proof of existence, encoding meta-coins, transacting value, anything else), just the act of using it increases the demand, utility and liquidity of Bitcoin.  This works in a feedback loop that then increases the security and utility of the blockchain, which then opens new applications for it.

Why is it that every single person who finds Bitcoin feels the need to compare it to MySpace and Facebook????
Revolutionary thought:  Your bank is MySpace, Bitcoin is Facebook.
Altcoins are not going to outcompete Bitcoin because:
If by some miracle an altcoin gained significant traction with some feature that wasn't able to be reverse implemented into Bitcoin, their tiny community would get steamrolled by a proposal to switch all the Bitcoin blockchain balances over to their coin and to start using that.
If God himself arrived on Earth and gifted us an alt coin that was 100x better than Bitcoin, it would still take several years to build up all of the following aspects which it has taken Bitcoin several years to build.
* Mining network, security
* VC money
* Brand recognition
* Open source dev community, bug fixes
* Merchant adoption
* Consumer adoption
* Documentation writing and Youtube video production
* Exchanges and other infrastructure including wallet ecosystem
* Diehard hodlers
* Meme culture and gentlemen
* Knock off competing altcoins
* subs
* subs
Plenty of time for Bitcoiners to incorporate, absorb, or force their incumbency on.  In that case of course everyone in Bitcoin would be happy, because they'd maintain their stake in the global crypto revolution while upgrading the product.
But there's no need for any of that, because most things can be patched back into Bitcoin. And anything that isn't is unlikely going to be so much better than Bitcoin that it can beat Bitcoin in the way that Bitcoin can beat the USD.
And that's all if alt coins don't get swallowed by side chains or tree chains.

Yes, Bitcoin will spread without you or anyone else mentioning it to others, suggesting it to people when the use case is appropriate etc.  But only because everyone else will keep up that "marketing" in your absence.

You need to think this over a bit more.
You can't guarantee 100% of the transactions aren't spam, but unless 100% ARE (which also is ultra unlikely) then a total growth of transaction means a growth in useful network use.  It might not be as much as the graph indicates, since some of it will be spam, but some of it isn't.  So overall Bitcoin is still getting more useful.

People not understanding that there is no need for a Bitcoin bank is a *temporary* problem *with people*, gold being filled with tungsten is a *permanent* problem *with gold*.  My point is that there's nothing that needs to specifically be changed or done to Bitcoin itself to solve the whole "we still think we need a bank thing", just that time and education will teach people and then the problem will cease.


When I say "really not that hard to do", I mean compared to setting up a bank with adequate physical security to store a ton of dollars / gold.  Comparatively, buying a $100 laptop and/or a cheap printer plus a couple of hours learning the mechanism of proper cold storage is pretty good compared to starting JP Morgan Chase, especially since cold storage scales to large amounts of money and trans-national security far better than any bank possibly could.
And it's getting better all the time.  I haven't used a Trezor yet, but apparently that's pretty much plug in, write down the seed, off you go.  That's the sort of thing that will bring it from comparatively easy down to "your granny can use it" easy.
Also, the vast majority of "I lost my Bitcoin" cases are due to trust in unnecessary (eventually) institutions like Mt Gox, which is exactly the point I'm making.

I love so much how Bitcoin's marketing campaign is also peer-to-peer, and thus is snowballing at a rate that is impossible for any company or government to compete with.
Bitcoin is advertised in every language, constantly, to people via trusted sources (their friends) in a way that is tailored exactly to what they need to hear about it.  The media is starting to get in on the action and provide useful summaries of the technology instead of just "that online Ponzi scheme", which will only accelerate the effect.
It's a strategy that no centrally planned and coordinated, hierarchical marketing department can compete with.
@_date: 2014-11-14 03:22:43
Depends on your target audience obviously.
If it's your Argentinian cousin, perhaps the lack of ability to debase the currency would be a good selling point.
If it's your early 20s entrepreneurial friend with some cash to splash maybe the speculative asset side appeals to him.
If it's your sister's boyfriend from China, then the ability to rout past monetary controls to send money to and from his parents in the provinces is a good place to start.
If it's your father the economist, you aren't going to convince him but it can be fun to keep bringing it up anyway.  And buy a little Bitcoin on the side that you'll gift to him on the moon once he grudgingly explains away his earlier skepticism and admits in a roundabout way that once upon a time he might perhaps not have been totally supportive.
TL:DR; Depends on your audience.  If you want more specific advice, specify an audience, and people with experience with that audience will chime in.

I laughed when I heard Daniel Krawisz's explanation of Ethereum, which paraphrased is something like:

Source: [Somewhere in this video]( watched it last night and I'll let someone else find the specific time stamp.
Edit:  So turns out the [Ethereum White paper]( is 36 (!!!) pages long.  Satoshi only took [9 pages]( (including plenty of white space, a few diagrams and one page of references) and he had to explain cryptocurrency from scratch.
As much as I think their project is interesting and wish the Ethereum team success, the entire operation just seems to be so over complicated that at very best it will be a solution looking for a problem to solve, and more likely an unfortunate failure since among the hundreds of layers of theoretical musings something wasn't quite right.

2)  Why would something **ever** grow in value if it wasn't useful?  The only thing that acts like that is a Ponzi scheme, and if you don't understand why Bitcoin isn't one then go do some reading about that, there's plenty of "myth busting" material around on exactly that topic.
4)  There's no need to wait and hope, just be one of the consumers wanting to spend Bitcoin.  Help your friends become the same.  If you own one a business, become one of the merchants accepting Bitcoin.
5)  In theory, if you wait long enough it will become mainstream in your area.  You can speed the process by being proactive though.  Read the articles I linked you, above, that's how Bitcoin will become a compelling case.

Some good discussion.


When a holder spends, what's important is that there is another holder there to take there place, as it's either that or the market cap drops.  When a buy and spender spends, the same necessity for a holder is there.  This is why holders are the root of everything.


You did say:  "It may be that overall, saving/hoarding Bitcoin has also positive effects, but you can't say it's ONLY positive for Bitcoin adoption, that makes no sense, nothing works like that in real life. Forget about trying to get a perfect game theory model for a second."
This is my point, it is black and white, and the price going up is good and down is bad, at least from the point of view where global Bitcoin acceptance is the goal.




You're absolutely right, Bitcoin does not need to do everything, nor can it.  However, it will be the only crypto with **monetary** value, which is exactly the point you make when discussing how other networks can interface with Bitcoin through payment networks.  That just means the other coin is going to be worth 0 or 1 satoshi or something while everyone constantly cashes out into Bitcoin, with only a tiny fragment of people buying that coin to use that network's service at the instant and only for the exact amount they actually need to use it.
I should clarify when I said "Most alt coins have at best a marginal increase in utility over Bitcoin", I should probably have said "Most alt coins have at best a marginal increase in utility over Bitcoin **as a form of money**", I thought you would have inferred that from this being the entire point of our discussion.
Refer to this point again:


App coins may exist, and may be useful on their network, but it's delusional to think any of them will be a long-term store of value or have a trend that is anything approaching 0, unless you think that one coin would replace Bitcoin and all other cryptos.  
There's a lot of Linux Distros, but I'm sure wherever you live there is not a lot of different currencies in common use, at most there would be two or three, and even then one would be dominant by a large user base above the others.

I won't buy into this "stock", because as far as I can see there's very little hard work that's gone in at all.  I also can't see a sustainable profit being made by providing a useful service.

Why do Buttcoiners always reason by way of evidently flawed analogy.
Jumping off a bridge is stupid, obviously.
Bitcoin is supposedly flawed for some of the reasons I mentioned, but the "blockchain invention" is even being found in Buttcoin circles to have merit.  The two cannot be separated, but apparently Buttcoiners think so.
What it's more like is Bitcoiners using a bungy rope to jump off bridges, and Buttcoiners standing around laughing at the rope.  The rope isn't perfect, but it's constantly being experimented with and improved upon.  Despite admitting that the idea of a rope and bungy jumping isn't so bad, Buttcoiners think that the exact construction of the Bitcoin rope is fundamentally flawed.  I'm asking them to invent a better rope, which they will find impossible.
This is still a pretty shitty analogy, but it's much closer to the original point I am making.

Yes, a stable price in terms of fiat currency.  For goods and services however it may well do, and that's all you need for a Bitcoin-only economy.  From slightly further down in the article:

Bitcoin CEO issued a press release.
@_date: 2014-07-16 02:22:18
I thought you'd say that.  Here's Roger Ver (you may have heard of him), [giving Bitcoin a bad name](
I'm glad you think Bitcoin is cool, I used to be in that spot too, but with time I'm confident you will come to the realisation that either Bitcoin swallows as much world commerce as possible, or it is surpassed by something better.  There is no middle ground.
1)  No, they won't give it up without a fight.  But it's a fight they're going to lose, as Bitcoin was designed specifically to win that fight.
2)  It discourages excessive consumer spending, sure, but that doesn't mean there is zero spending at all.  People buy things with Bitcoin, that's a fact.  
Moreover, people buy things with credit cards in fiat, which should be subject to the same logic of "but it'll be worth more tomorrow!".  People also buy computers, smart phones and other pieces of technology that constantly get better and cheaper, in fact those industries have been booming like none other.
There's a premium people will pay for having something now, and people are always going to buy food, houses, clothing and so on even if it would be 1% cheaper next year.  Bitcoin is no different.
3)  Well, Bitcoin's growing enormously without price stability, but I'll give you that it's not an undesirable attribute.  Store of value -&gt; Medium of transfer -&gt; Unit of account.  This is the expected Bitcoin transition, and it's going splendidly.
4)  Yes Bitcoin has technical scalability problems.  Some of the smartest people in the world are already working on it, and I have no doubt that a solution will be found.
Bitcoin does not need to comprise every single global transaction, but it does seem likely to become the foundation that everything else is built on.
In fact, you can already see the evidence of this in things like off-blockchain transactions through Coinbase or Reddit tip-bot.  Add to that all the transactions going on in alt coins, that are essentially "backed" by their value against Bitcoin and it's clear that Bitcoin as a foundation for a monetary system can go a long long way.  
If you need some more of your questions answered, I recommend the Nakamoto Institute essays.  
TL:DR; When should Bitcoin stop growing?  When is "enough" Bitcoin adoption?  Well, national currencies stop at their nation's borders.  Bitcoin has no borders.  Bitcoin can only be expected to stop growing when either a better alt coin comes along (we haven't seen it yet), or it comprises as much of world commerce as it possibly can.

These are the key misunderstandings you have.
* Initially rewards early adopters
* Perpetually rewards those who support the network (miners, and anyone who wants to can start being a miner)
* Initially rewarded early adopters
* Perpetually rewards the US Fed
Bitcoin is skewed to reward early adopters, but not "always forever", just once.
The initial reward to early adopters is great, but as I said above they can only spend that reward once.  They don't get a constant stream of new Bitcoins just cos they bought some at $5.
This is fundamentally different to the USD, where the Fed and established banks get a constant flow of new currency, just for being in control of the system.
So no, it's not what we already have.


I already discussed this...
"If people buy and never spend it and die with it, who cares?
If they bought early and have a lot of money now, they are being fairly rewarded for supporting a revolutionary technology that everyone else thinks/thought was stupid, pointless, valueless or never going to survive. They can only spend into circulation once, and then they have to earn them back at 'market' value."

Bitcoin's response to increasing demand is to increase in price.  And unlike almost anything else, including the USD or any other non-crypto currency, Bitcoin's increasing price only makes it more useful, with no ceiling.  Infinite divisibility means Bitcoin never suffers from being "too expensive".
Also, if Bitcoin is going to work it's going to become the world's preeminent currency.  I'm no expert, but I'd imagine most of the volatility in current currencies comes from trading for other currencies, as opposed to changes in the actual goods flowing around each economy.  There's some pretty crazy statistics about the amount of money on the Forex markets every day.  If Bitcoin is the only currency, it won't be really traded against other currencies (except a couple of tiny cryptos, as it is now) because it will have subsumed them all.  Also, if the entire world uses Bitcoin there will be a relatively constant and rather enormous demand for them, and the price changes will not be anywhere near the volatility of Bitcoin today, or even gold.  The price may not ever be 100% stable, even the much-lauded fiat currencies with their "expertly managed" supply schemes aren't, but it'll be good enough.

I don't know if I agree with this.
It seems most likely people will adopt Bitcoin out of necessity rather than convenience or curiosity.  So at that point trust won't be an issue, because whatever alternatives they are used to (fiat) will be doing so poorly that anything else (i.e. Bitcoin) is a better bet.
You might be right though, but I think you're underestimating how quickly things can spread once a critical mass of awareness is reached by most of the population, and a critical mass of adopters is reached as a subsection of the population.
The first 1% of the population to adopt Bitcoin will (and is) taking much, much longer than the remaining 99% will.

If you can't see the difference between Occupy Wall Street and Bitcoin yourself, then there's not much I can do to help you.  But really:
* Occupy Wall Street came and went, I don't know how long, but for less than 6 months was big news.  Bitcoin has been around for 5 years, and keeps growing.
* Bitcoin does not require continual physical presence somewhere protesting stuff (obviously unsustainable), it's just an integration into existing daily life.
* Occupy Wall Street protests were "decentralised", but still gathered around central spots and required sufficient size to be noteworthy.  Two people together in public doesn't make an Occupy Wall Street Protest, but it does make a Bitcoin transaction.
* Occupy Wall Street (people protesting in the street) was explicitly "fuck the government" and familiar to law enforcement authorities so they knew how to handle it.  Bitcoin is implicitly "fuck the government", and unfamiliar to law enforcement authorities, so they don't have an optimised response prepared.

No, but there was an intervening period where it was fantastic.  I don't know if you've heard of guys like Seth Godin, or the people at Copyblogger, but they basically got the jump on internet blogs in the early 2000s and made a really, really good career out of it.  Now the market is way over saturated, but they're still market leaders and making good money.
Same thing happened with creating Youtube channels.
The point is that there's a window of opportunity when something is new and untapped to get in and take significant advantage, and that window is starting now with Bitcoin and microtipping because it still isn't *quite* there yet.  If you got started now, you'd benefit from the huge surge in interest and use as one of the few early entrants in the market.  Then you can move on to the next thing in 10 years time when you spot the next upcoming trend.

I'm interested in response too, because my own "sales pitch" for Bitcoin I'm sure could use a lot of work.
My best recommendation though is that for (primarily, young) people who are familiar with BitTorrent, most of Bitcoin can be pretty well encapsulated by "an Excel spreadsheet recording everyone's bank balance, run by a network similar to Bittorrent".  That gives the idea about decentralisation, government resistance, crowd supported and hints at mining and the blockchain enough not to have to immediately go into laborious detail about the "how" and just have them satisfied that "it works, so what can we do with it", which is the more important part of the discussion.

The thousands of bad ones aren't as widely used though. It's a natural part of the growth cycle that if it gets more popular, it will attract more/better developers, and thus get more secure.
There's no guarantee that similar security holes don't exist in closed source software, the difference is that they won't be picked up and fixed until a major problem happens when someone finds an exploit without needing the code.

SO glad to see this.  Perhaps the distribution will skew to current Bitcoiners who buy it up from their classmates, but maybe less than expected if there's an "official" alternative that the students know is available should they want to offload them without any trouble, and simultaneously a means for them to get back in if and when the buzz really catches on.

Extensive comment I made answering how you physically spend Bitcoin, from a Coinbase account.  Reposted below:
0-. Acquire Bitcoin on Coinbase (I'm not a user, so I don't know how this process goes, but I imagine it's pretty straightforward)
1-. Have Bitcoin in Coinbase
2-. Find vendor that accepts Bitcoin
3-. If vendor is Internet based, select "Pay with Bitcoin".
3a. Copy address code displayed on screen.
3b. Paste address code into Coinbase "Send Bitcoin" function.
3c. Type in required amount of Bitcoin to send, as displayed on merchant's website.
3d. Hit send
3e. (Optional), possibly confirm via an authentication code sent to your mobile for extra security
3f. Wait for product to be delivered.
3g. Proceed to step 5.
4-. If merchant is physically located, download a Bitcoin wallet app on your phone.
4a. On Android I recommend Mycelium, and on iPhone I guess Blockchain, but I don't have one so ymmv.
4b. Send a sufficient amount of Bitcoin from your Coinbase account to your phone wallet, using a process almost identical to steps 3a. -&gt; 3e. above.
4c. Transport yourself to the merchant
4d. Announce intention to pay via Bitcoin
4e. Wait to be presented with an iPad, or QR code receipt
4f. Scan QR code with mobile phone
4g. Type in amount you owe the merchant
4h. Hit send
4i. Wait ~2 seconds for transaction to propagate in network, and merchant to confirm it has been seen.
4j. Walk away with your item.
5-. Enjoy being a part of the free economy, as well as your burger/alpaca socks!
5a. (optional) answer questions from curious onlookers
Looks like a lot of steps, because I've been as explicit as possible like you requested, but in reality it all happens pretty simply. It'll be even easier if the merchant is accepting Bitcoin via Coinbase, but you can't bank on that being the case.
Just give it a go, anyone accepting Bitcoin understands that it's new and not everyone is a 2011-era-hardcore expert.

I'm no expert, but the proposals for tree chains and/or side chains are one example.  Those aren't thought up, coded or put to the community and implemented overnight.
Also, the off chain transactions when a Coinbase user pays bitcoin to a Coinbase Bitcoin merchant is perhaps a better example of scalability solutions that are already implemented.  Similar idea with Reddit tip bots.
The introduction of SPV clients like Multibit (or Mycelium) allows Bitcoin to run on computers / mobile phones without storing 17 GB of data like the initial Satoshi client would have required.
Yet another is the proliferation of alt coins, which ultimately will likely be absorbed by Bitcoin but in the meantime provide a lot of "off blockchain" transactions, as well as a significant amount of innovation in looking at possible alternatives to scalability issues (don't ask me to name one specific example, I don't follow the hundreds of alt coins properly but I'm sure there is at least one looking at this, Doge's 100 billion initial units if you really really need a shitty example).
You're right though, not much has changed in the core protocol as far as I know.  But not all solutions have to be in the code, there's plenty of room for innovation at other levels.

Ghash hit 51%.  People left the pool.  Discus fish gained traction as a competitor.  The market self-corrected.  Pool distribution currently looking the healthiest it has been since, with at least 5 pools required to make a 51% share.  Ghash around 18%.
Core issues/improvements will either be super important or not.  If they're super important, at some stage they will grow an alt coin to the point it threatens Bitcoin and Bitcoiners will hard fork or buy new mining hardware or whatever is necessary to preserve it.
Or it won't be, and they won't.
Do you mean mining distribution, or coin distribution?  I meant the latter, and that's what my comment addressed.  Mining distribution seemed too similar to your previous point, which I also addressed.

Any off-topic concerns about Bitcoin not already discussed here can be raised in another thread and argued over by someone else.

What you're missing is that a large part of Bitcoin is the strong political potential it has, and that that's actually largely integral to its success.  In many ways, the technology cannot be divorced from the ethos that goes along with it.
I remember the last time a small, un-opinionated, rather non-commital group of people facing endless skepticism and criticism successfully boot strapped a world changing technology... said no one ever.

Luckily currency has a much stronger network effect than media sharing or social media services, both of which can be used simultaneously to their competitors at almost zero opportunity cost.  This is not true of currencies, where holding one is of necessity lowering your investment in another.

Your question is a bit silly, in that it's essentially "Is there a fast way to make almost $20 000 from (mining on) my laptop? aka with out specialised hardware", to which the answer is no.  You could mine $20k bitcoin in a month, but it would probably cost you more than $20k to acquire the hardware, and certainly not rapidly.
The facetious but very correct answer you've got instead is that you should instead earn bitcoins, not spend them, and eventually you will reach the metaphorical "moon" (crypto currencies share a culture of an absurd valuation of their currency being known as the 'moon') of 30 Bitcoins.

Location is just a part of context, it happens to be the most relevant for the word 'dollars' but there's no reason it has to be the same for the world bits.
On Bitcoin subreddit: "My coffee today cost 10 000 bits."
In a music studio: "The bit rate on this song is too damn high, it's going to be such high quality."
In a history textbook: "Historically, one bit (an archaic unit of measurement equal to 1/8th of a silver coin) was used to pay for a barber's haircut."
At a casual party: "Would you like a bit of cake, Johnny?"
At the zoo: "Don't stick your bits in the crocodile cage or they'll get ripped off."
It seems unlikely the vast majority of fluent English speakers would be in any way confused in all of these scenarios.  Yes, I expanded on the meaning in the history book example, but that's what would be done anyway.  I've never heard about bit being used as a piece of silver in my entire life except in discussion on about the "bits" unit denomination, so the average textbook would surely clarify.  
English is already a nightmare for non-native speakers, this one isn't going to break the camel's back.

The terminology of bits is functionally equivalent to a "stock split", especially for new and uneducated users.

I am most interested in the fact that every single previous bubble as far as I'm aware stopped when Mt Gox crashed/couldn't process trades/went insolvent.  That gave the market time to cool off and lots of Bitcoiners/traders to think calmly about selling at a profit.
With much more varied and solid channels available now for Bitcoin trading, a failed exchange is much less likely to provide this respite.
I feel like the next bubble is going to be huge (and might even be the last one) for these reasons:
- No Mt Gox, as explained above.  Many more ways to get Bitcoin, cheaper and easier than ever before on exchanges/websites.  Throw in a ton of Bitcoin ATMs and more and more localbitcoins/Mycelium sellers etc.
- The all time high is close to the price of gold.  If we can break the ATH it is almost guaranteed to get above the gold price, and from there I can just see tons of headlines "Bitcoin more valuable than gold!".  While the 1 BTC ~ 1 ounce of gold comparison is rather arbitrary, what matters is the psychological impact.  A lot of goldbugs will seriously rethink their preconceptions at this point.
- The 2013 bubble and subsequent 2014 ecosystem development has made a lot of people aware of Bitcoin, but seemingly right to dismiss it since it "failed", "went bankrupt", "collapsed" etc.  All these people will realise their need to rethink things when they hear "it's back".
- Skepticism in the media is also greatly reduced.  A Bitcoin interview doesn't open with "but it's all a Ponzi scheme right?" like it always did just 12 months ago, instead it's "So Microsoft/Marc Andreesen/PayPal/etc. is getting into Bitcoin, things are kind of starting to get serious, aren't they?"
- The potential for panic-inducing media shots now is magnitudes higher than before.  If CNBC puts up a shot of people lining up at a Bitcoin ATM with the words "Bitcoin hits all time high" underneath it on national TV in America, you'd better believe things are going to get crazy.
- Enough banks and governments are looking at Bitcoin that a huge change in consumer sentiment might occur if it turns out some government/bank/hedge fund/large financial institution is quietly buying up Bitcoin.  Wall St also will put their skates on once they realise they might have been dawdling around a bit long thinking they have more time than they do.
- If Bitcoin can get into around the $5 000 range, with around $50billion market cap, we might start seeing it swallow up some of the not-insignificant currencies in a speculative attack, as explained [here](
But who knows really.
My feeling is March/April 2015 for this all to kick off, but I explicitly state this as pure speculation based on nothing but my own observation and feeling of the market (yes yes, very unscientific) in full anticipation that Buttcoin will RemindMe! bot in four months.

The merchant will have built up a reputation for being honest (this might include even destroying some of their own Bitcoin initially, called "proof of burn"), which is more valuable to them than the proceeds of ripping off one consumer.
If the user is still not convinced, a third party arbitrator can be freely chosen for a small fee using multisig (2 of 3 required to complete the transaction) to provide the buyer with some recourse if their product does not arrive (or is not up to scratch, as if this can be demonstrated to the arbitrator then the buyer's money will be returned).
Edit:  Oh right, apparently that's not good enough for you.
If there's already a number of advantages (which you have listed), and the solution to their concerns is also not acceptable to you (I think it would be much cheaper and more adaptable than Paypal's arbitration, but I don't know and the market is still developing) then you're at a dead end and should just give up your misplaced evangelism.
I don't understand why you would even need to convince the merchants a buyer would use it (that's like the buyer needing to be convinced why the seller wants Bitcoin and is offering that payment option, it's not necessary), as far as they're concerned a lack of chargebacks should be fantastic and it shouldn't matter to them why a consumer would give up chargeback protections.
Use another payment option or find somewhere else (especially Bitcoin accepting!) to shop.  These Chinese merchants will get on board once they see enough demand, and with that growing constantly it's just a matter of time.  Don't waste your own time on a fruitless campaign that isn't helping anyone.

But not everyone can be expected to invest based on potential future value, and everyone who will (right now, pretty much) already has.

Yes, and what increases the transactions per second on the network?  Spenders.  And where do the spenders come from?  The Holders.  The source is always the holders.


Yes, I can say that.  Bitcoin adoption is positive for Bitcoin.  What's so unbelievable about that?  I cannot think of a single circumstance in which an additional person becoming a Bitcoin hodler would ever be bad for Bitcoin.


No, there IS a magical division line between Bitcoin and all other alt/app coins.  That magical division line is:
* First mover advantage.
* Longest history and most proven security.
* Largest mining network.
* ... which leads into the network effect.  Bitcoin is ~17 times as big as all the other alt coins combined by market cap.  It really is in a category of its own.
Note that the network effect applies not only to consumer adoption, but to merchant adoption, developer adoption, VC adoption, hardware adoption (when's the last time you heard about an alt coin Trezor?) etc.  Every single category Bitcoin will be magnitudes larger than any alt coin.
Also note that the Nakamoto Institute guys support alt coin development and experimentation for the purposes of pushing the limits of crypto, finding possible upgrades to Bitcoin etc. but just object to the promises that it'll be a good investment or actually have monetary value one day.


Bitcoin is backed by the network effect (users, merchants, developers etc.), its mining network and security and its utility. That combination of things is unlikely to ever be challenged by any alt coin, unless it's as much better than Bitcoin as Bitcoin is than the USD (highly unlikely in the foreseeable future).  Most alt coins have at best a marginal increase in utility over Bitcoin, and a much much smaller mining network and network effect.
Bitcoin doesn't need to be backed by a claim to this or that (whether storage on a network or gold or government support), that's the beauty of it, there's no need for trust in someone to ever exchange it for anything else, it is valued just for it's potential to transfer to someone else.

You have some reading to do.
All the Bitcoin coders have Bitcoin themselves, and would not benefit from devaluing that by raising the cap.  But let's just say they did...
Changes to the source code are only implemented on the network if 51% of the miners accept it and move to the new version, who all hold Bitcoin and have a direct interest in not allowing their existing ones to be devalued by raising the cap.  But let's just say they did...
The miners are only able to process transactions submitted by BTC holders / users, who have a direct interest in not allowing their existing coins to be devalued by raising the cap, and so would not send transactions or upgrade their clients if the cap was lifted.
TL:DR; not happening.  Sure, if most of the devs, most of the miners, and most of the users, who ALL have a vested interest in NOT raising the cap suddenly decide to shoot themselves in the foot then we'll end up with more than 21 million Bitcoin.  But I can't see that happening.

I guess they've never heard of the [Streisand effect](  Of course they're in a lose-lose situation, because if they ignore Bitcoin it will continue to grow and if they criticise Bitcoin they will continue to bring attention to it.
Either way, I feel very sorry for such a group who clearly have very little else to occupy their time, are likely jealous of many early adopters and by and large are very shortsighted about the potential of Bitcoin to change the way many of us think about economics, technology and politics.

Network effect only applies to things that are comparable competitors.
USD and EUR are comparable competitors.
BTC and LTC are comparable competitors.
USD and BTC are obviously in different classes.  This should not only be obvious from their fundamental characteristics, but the fact that Bitcoin started at price 0 with no network, and now has a massive network and $300+ valuation.  If the USD network effect would crush BTC, it would have done it when Bitcoin was $0, $0.1, $1, $2 or $3.  But it didn't, so it is obvious that Bitcoin can compete against even the worldwide reserve currency status of the dollar.
In contrast, LTC constantly loses value against Bitcoin, only recovering slightly when Bitcoin itself bubbles and by association it is dragged along, only to resume plummeting.

This is just beyond stupid.  That's like not being a gold bug, but receiving some free ounces, KNOWING THEY HAD A MARKET VALUE, and sending them to landfill.  It's not like you had to even do anything, you could have just let them rest on your Reddit account. There's no downside to keeping them, and potentially a lot of downside to deleting them, which you *went out of your way* to do. I have to say regardless of your opinion on Bitcoin most people would agree this is a pretty unintelligent thing to do. 


Well it obviously didn't because you failed (and apparently still do) to see the potential of the technology.  All you had to do was have some foresight, buy, and hodl.  I know you say that's simplistic, but it's been true for all 5-6 years since Bitcoin was invented and the trend does not look like stopping.


Yes.  I've been on an exchange watching as the price plummets very sharply this year, and been tempted but not sold.


Yes.  This is what I have done all this year, except the price has been going down.


After all this time, after everything Bitcoin has overcome from when it was less than $10, you still do not see even a little bit of potential?  I can understand people that bought at the top of the 2014 bubble and are now in the Buttcoin camp, but if you've seen multiple years of amazingly rapid technology advancement and multiple price recoveries and you're still hardheaded "this is nothing special" you must be incredibly stubborn and ego-invested in your own beliefs.
If Bitcoin is just a "high risk lottery ticket", that implies you see it does have some chance, however small, that it WILL change the world and get to crazy high valuations.  Otherwise you'd say I was just throwing money away on a guaranteed loss.
I wish you luck on your journey to realise your mistake, although at this rate I have a feeling it's not going to be for a long while. If Bitcoin doesn't fail, it will just keep growing, and at some point your foolishness will be so obvious that despite your large ego investment you become a Bitcoin owner.  The sooner that happens, the better off you'll be, but things don't look good.

Then someone built Armory, Blockchain.info, Electrum, Hive, Mycelium, Multibit and so on.  Now there's more wallets than I know what to do with.
This same process will be replicated for services like Bitpay and Coinbase, it's just going to take some time.  Someone has to prove it's profitable and worthwhile, and remove a lot of the risk, before others can take it to the next level or come off the sidelines to compete.

Everyone in Bitcoin is getting richer due to the limited supply and growing economy.  Everyone in USD is getting poorer (except the bankers) due to the quantitative easing and shrinking economy.  Who is going to stick with the USD besides the tiny elite that currently benefit from it?  It has no option but to constantly devalue against Bitcoin, and that's only going to be more obvious over time, prompting an ever greater inflow of adopters.

1.  Exchange it for a good you provide, as you would acquire any other currency
2.  Exchange it for a service you provide, as you would acquire any other currency
3.  Sell some of your existing currency and buy bitcoin with it, as you would acquire any foreign currency when travelling overseas

Depends what you mean by fast transactions.
If you've ever sent a Bitcoin transaction, you will discover it propagates in a matter of seconds, just like how an email doesn't need to be any faster.
If you're worried that 0 confirmation transactions are a problem, then I'd like to hear your solution.  Lower block times are **not** a solution.  Litecoin has a 2.5 minute block time, and Bitcoin has 10 minutes.  Even if Litecoin's "hash rate" were equivalent to Bitcoin (it isn't, but Scrypt vs SHA256 so we're comparing apples to oranges), all that would mean is that you need 4 Litecoin transactions to have the same amount of security as 1 Bitcoin transaction, and at the same time you have greatly increased the occurrence of orphaned blocks and the likelihood of network forks.  If this were a solution, then everyone would just change to a coin with a 5 second block time, or we could fork Bitcoin to do the same, but we haven't cos it isn't.
0 confirmation transactions will be (and are) ok for small transactions, or can be alleviated by a payment processor or similar if the fraud risk is too unacceptable.  If you're buying a Lamborghini, it's going to take you 20 minutes to sign the paperwork anyway.

His answer is that he wants to transact in small amounts of Bitcoin off chain, which is too expensive on chain.  You can do that in Bitcoin, Changetip is a perfect example.  Gems are not necessary for that.
This point is then brought up by the viewers, and he doesn't really have a good response.  Some other viewers say it's got something to do with the crowdsale, but that ALSO could have been done by a direct Bitcoin financing model.
Edit:  Here we go, from the linked video, pretty much an admission this is a scam:
"So obviously creating a new token, that with it we can reward the users without actually using the BTC that we need for development, I think makes sense."
So the real value is in the BTC and the development, and the initial users are getting told "look, have these GEMS instead, they'll be worth something sometime in the future!", with no proof that all the development work being funded by the BTC will actually turn into a service that is profitable.

Besides some time figuring out how to switch without screwing everything up, I don't understand why some of the bigger miners DON'T move into P2Pool.  As far as I understand it the variance is slightly higher but on a long time frame or at a larger hash rate that's not a problem.  And surely the Bitcoin miners want the system to stay decentralised, because that's what makes it valuable.  Just seems like a tangible benefit for a once off, very low cost.

No I don't agree that hoarding ever discourages using Bitcoin.
The more people that 'hoard' (aka 'save'), the more demand there is for Bitcoin.  Price goes higher, liquidity increases.  If the demand for Bitcoin grows stronger because Bitcoin holders are even more determined not to spend it, than merchants are even MORE incentivised to accept it as it's obviously something a lot of people value. They're also incentivised to provide discounts to encourage people to spend (so the merchant can hodl), until they reach a point where the merchant and consumer make a transaction, as clearly there must be a floor above a price of '0'.
There's a lot more merchants accepting Bitcoin now that the price is ~$500 than when it was around ~$5.  That's because there's more people wanting to spend it, which is because there's even more people that want to hold it.
Someone can be a holder but not a spender, but can't be a spender without needing someone else to be a holder (whether the merchant, or another Bitcoiner via Coinbase or Bitpay).  The holders are the foundation of everything, spending and merchant adoption happens as a natural consequence.
Their intentions are to spread the ideals of freedom, and Bitcoin is a fantastic tool for doing that.  They were arguing that app coins don't and won't have any **monetary** value, for very good reasons.  See:

It's never necessary for most of humanity to understand how most stuff works.
I couldn't give you a detailed breakdown of TCP/IP, and nor could 99/100 people you picked off the street.  We all still browse the Internet though.
In the future, people will interact with Bitcoin through simple hardware devices (perhaps just a smart phone app, or a specifically designed NFC device with accompanying payment nodes), that they wave past the scanner and watch their balance go down.  That will be all they'll need to know about Bitcoin, and it will be all most of them will know about Bitcoin.
This is why Trezor releasing some real product is exciting, it's a huge leap towards the kind of "plug and play" hardware needed for Bitcoin to go mainstream.

Bitcoin does not scale linearly, but either we find a workaround or we don't.
If we do, this is no longer a problem.
If we don't, in all probability Bitcoin becomes the crypto "backing" the value of other systems or coins.  This is already happening, see alt coin markets like Cryptsy or Mintpal, almost everything trades against Bitcoin, some things trade against Litecoin, and almost no other pairs trade against each other.  In this case you are still better buying Bitcoin now than any other coin.
It's not a good idea to diversify into different coins, because you're just removing some of Bitcoin's key attribute (liquidity) to provide it to something that is destined to fail (another crypto with a much smaller liquidity and traction among developers/merchants/users etc).
This isn't to say that alt coins shouldn't be a testing ground for solutions to Bitcoin's problems, they absolutely should.  What this does mean is that 99.99% of them will not have significant monetary value in the future, so "investing" in them is just throwing money away.
The same reason it's not a good idea to diversify your gold/silver precious metals into wood, stones or sand simply because they are similar resources that might have some utility.  They will never replicate the key attributes that makes precious metals what they are, so diversifying is just throwing away money on a losing horse.

This is the key aspect that every nitpicker overlooks.
Yes, Bitcoin is not and might never be as efficient at transferring USD as USD payment rails are.  But what is for sure is that Bitcoin is more efficient at transferring bitcoin than USD payment rails are, and likely ever will be.
The subtle switch which most critics seem to think isn't going to happen, but the seedlings already are starting to germinate, is in people being happy to stick with Bitcoin and not needing USD at all.  Sending USD via Bitcoin is at most an intermediate step, and doesn't even need to be a compelling option (or even better than existing options, just workable) if the Bitcoin ecosystem has enough other things to offer with smart contracts, lack of censorship, new crowd funding opportunities, utility as a global currency etc. 
Nevermind that most of the world doesn't give half a shit about the USD anyway, just most of Reddit since Americans are the majority demographic.
Bitcoin is not going to fail because it can't send USD better than existing payment solutions, but most of the whiners seem to think that's the one single essential use case and the only reason Bitcoin is exciting, worthwhile or successful.
Look, Bitcoin can't send USD better than my bank from me to my cousin in the neighbouring city of a first world country!  It's game over Bitcoin community, better pack up and go home now.  /s

Whether inflation is good or bad depends on your economic outlook, but I'd certainly not prefer to have my currency devalued by an increasing supply which is distributed unequally to a small portion of the population to receive first-benefit at my and most other people's expense.
Bitcoin so far appears to have no problem being spent into circulation despite it's deflationary characteristics, for instance Overstock.com's recent announcement that the average Bitcoin purchaser spends 34% more than the average fiat customer.
Bitpay have also said that when Bitcoin price rises, transaction volume rises too.  Instead of "hoarding" (aka saving, but phrased to put a negative spin on what is otherwise a positive economic phenomenon), Bitcoin users appear to respond to their increasing wealth by spending what is effectively "free" money.
This seems to indicate that a long term deflationary curve is very sustainable.  Note that the deflation occurs due to limited supply rather than oversupply leading to a collapse in demand, which is an entirely different and much more problematic phenomenon that fiat suffers from.

A volatile asset can be an excellent store of value, if its trend over the storage period is up.
Anyone who decided to store their value in Bitcoin in 2009, 2010, 2011 or 2012 is probably pretty happy with its performance right now.  And if they only got some in 2013 (or even 2012 or 2011) and have already decided they made a mistake, then they clearly didn't purchase in with the intent of storing value over the long term in the first place.


No, it means to retain *at least* that specific value until it is needed, and not decreasing in value.  What's the problem with a store of value that gets more valuable?  Shouldn't that be the *ideal* store of value?  
Gold is also considered a "store of value" because it goes up in the long term, not because it has a perfectly stable exchange rate.

No I don't believe in Bitcoin reaching billions because Roger Ver said so, it just happens that he did and you were saying being so "extreme" is giving Bitcoin a bad name so I took a better example then myself of why I don't think that's true.  I am definitely a Bitcoin evangelist though, and don't see anything wrong with that.
When you need to transfer information, there was tons of alternatives to the Internet.  Telephones, print media/mail etc. were all more established and yet got superseded
Can you explain TCP/IP?  I can't, and I earn money writing computer software.  Complete and total understanding is not a prerequisite for adoption.  People are and will develop Bitcoin tools that are "Click here to send money", "Click here to receive money", and that's what grandma and grandpa will use.  Just like how Google is literally one search bar and the "enter" key.  Or the entire DNS system allows for usage of simple mnemonics to navigate the internet rather than clunky IP addresses.  If you look at the simplification of wallet software over time you can already see this trend.  Mycelium I know has "simple mode" and you have to switch on "advanced tools" to do more than just send/recieve money.
Yes, this is the greatest wealth transfer the world has ever seen.  A lot of people are going to end up losing a lot of ~~money~~ purchasing power.  Money will not be eradicated, but currency might struggle, and there will be much broader acceptance of Bitcoin as money.

You're missing the point, Satoshi is never going to cash out and become a trillionaire.
He will be a "trillionaire" by nominal USD value just by owning a million Bitcoins, and Bitcoins individually being worth incredible amounts of USD (that will thus be almost worthless).
It is unlikely anyone else will become a "trillionaire" in the same way as Satoshi, because it is unconceivable anyone else could acquire a full million Bitcoins.  The Winklevii have around 100 000 I think, maybe 150 000, and it's unlikely anyone else will be able to match them either.  If Zuckerberg tried to buy that many now, he'd moon shot the price and it'd get out of his price range before he could match them.

That's how Bitcoin is going to take over use cases, countries and income levels that the banking system can't provide.  Mostly on the internet or in poor countries, like giving Africans access to the global financial market and secure wealth storage for the first time, not in rich and developed countries like the US and UK where everyone is hyped over reducing their two tap payment to one tap.

OP in case you hadn't realised, the Big Bang Theory stopped being about nerd/fringe stuff past Season 1.
Season 1 was successful because it found a niche among nerdy/geek/fringe stuff.  Penny was there for contrast.
Once it grew a fan base, the shows producers tried to "broaden the appeal" by adding more and more female characters.  All of the actual fringe stuff was phased out.
The show lapsed entirely into the male characters being treated like children by their female counterparts while they stumble in and out of romantic relationships.
The answer therefore is that Bitcoin will probably not appear on Big Bang Theory until it's already been mainstream for a year and a half.  Also, a terrible show and you should stop watching.

The regulations explicitly say that Satoshi would have been committing a crime in NY for releasing Bitcoin without getting government issued permission, and that Bitcoin businesses are not allowed to hodl Bitcoin, only US bonds.

Any thread from 2+ years ago the skeptics look foolish.  I suck at finding old threads on Reddit (is there a search which you can do by reverse age??), but here's a couple of shoddy examples.
Turns out there weren't actually that many skeptics in the Bitcoin reddit at that time, it was small enough to stay off the radar of trolls and arrogant critics, but I've found a couple.

- [3 years ago, what are Buttcoins? parody submitter deletes his account](
is three years old, and unfortunately the Wayback machine shows there were very [few comments at the time]( but you can bet when history repeats that the evidence will all be there two years from now.
Any thread from 1+ years ago, except for price predictions (price has dropped while adoption has exploded), the skeptics look foolish.
Example:  [1 year ago, 4/4 commenters on predict Microsoft will never take Bitcoin for XBox](
Your archiving bot is just going to end up making you look the same.  But don't take my word for it, just wait, and delete your reddit account in 2 years.

"Bitcoin" "will" "succeed".
-everyone in @_date: 2014-03-06 09:09:12
Maybe, but unlikely.
The "price" might go up, down, or anything else, should've been a bit more clear about the quotation marks being an indication that the nominal USD equivalent of the gold is pretty much irrelevant.  
However, the value is almost certain to increase, that is the quantity of real goods, real estate or whatever else you can exchange it for.  The purchasing power is likely to jump as a result not of an increase in "price" but just by the devaluation of everything else plus a spike in demand as everyone flees to the safety of precious metals.

Of course it's an arbitrary comparison, in the sense that there's no reason 1 Bitcoin should be compared to 1 troy oz over 1 gram or 1 tonne of gold, but it's the price for each that is most reported and referred to generally, and the most commonly used unit of each that people think about (at least until BTC switches more fully to mBTC and bits).
The comparison is valid for psychological reasons more than scientific or mathematical ones, and is likely to have at least some impact either way.

Well, I can USE Bitcoin to buy goods and services at thousands of places around the world.  I guess you use your fiat currency as wall paper then?
Bitcoin is "backed" by its utility.  It's the only thing on the planet (besides other crypto currencies - which all have very small liquidity) that is unforgeable, instantly transportable anywhere via the Internet, cannot be censored, for very low fees, divisible, scarce, liquid, durable and fungible.  This is a very useful and unique set of attributes.
If there was no Bitcoin, how would you buy drugs online?  Or donate to Wikileaks when Mastercard and Visa get told by the government to cut them off?  There is no alternative, and that's why Bitcoin is useful and thus has value.  Things grow from these fringe use cases to more "mainstream" uses like online shopping as a result of Bitcoin's efficiency, seeded by those edge cases.
Other people will also make claims that it is backed by its mining network, and/or the community of Bitcoin users, which are also both true in an obtuse kind of way.
@_date: 2014-08-07 09:13:22
Used... by who?
The miners want to get rid of it ASAP, and anyone they sell it to (a merchant, investor, hodler, someone building something on the Freicoin network) wants to get rid of it ASAP as well.
If your currency is "not meant to be bought" then you've got a problem.
@_date: 2014-07-10 00:05:55
Yes, well, given a significant portion of merchants are going to be incentivised to link addresses to other identifying information (eg. email addresses) on their own as a commercial practice, plus potential pressure from the government to do so as well, is looking at this a lot more realistically than you are.  It'd be great if everyone we wanted to buy from was also a pure Bitcoin anarchist, but even if global adoption happens 99% still won't be.
The kicker is in the development of dark wallet, or use of privacy-enhancing alt coins.

Satoshi has the most in different **addresses**, possibly or possibly not in the same wallet, only he would know.
One wallet can have many addresses, but one address can only be in one wallet.
FBI might have the most in a **single address**, but that doesn't make it any way more useful or valuable than Satoshi's spread out stash, in fact probably less so because it's easier to watch on the Blockchain.

You're thinking too much inside the box.
For example:  [Bitsquare](
p2p software download that coordinates cash (physical or via bank transfer I believe, definitely the latter) for Bitcoin exchanges with the software itself being the escrow and no-one being able to cheat the system.
It is somewhat like LocalBitcoins, but there's no central website, and there's no premium.

The war is won in stages my friend.
6 months ago everyone in my family thought I was a lunatic.  But I just kept mentioning it on and off.
3 months later, one of them (ironically, the youngest) asked me to explain more, and was happy to accept a little bit of it just to see how it worked.  
2 months after that, and all of them were happy to accept a little bit, even if they don't understand it.
Now, all of them actively bring up Bitcoin in relevant situations without even needing my prompting, and are starting to get more serious with their questions.  Though there hasn't been any active steps taken as far as I can see, at least two have declared a commitment to at least acquiring a little more.
An almost identical process is happening amongst my friends.
Ridicule slowly gives way to scepticism, to curiosity, to experimentation, to belief, to evangelism.  You can see the exact same thing happening in the media's view of Bitcoin.  Don't be pushy, but if you just keep talking even a little bit every once in a while about it, change is inevitable.
@_date: 2014-08-02 02:50:45

Higher price means more liquidity, usage and adoption of Bitcoin worldwide.  Getting excited about the price rising is equivalent to being excited about increases in adoption but with the added bonus of getting richer.

1.  No, there's no life-altering reason your mother should use Bitcoin yet
2.  Yes, this will probably change
3.  Here's some life-altering reasons other people already have to use Bitcoin: 
4.  It's obviously ridiculous to complain that the "Buy Bitcoin -&gt; Spend Bitcoin -&gt; Sell Bitcoin" cycle is too convoluted to make it useful, when the waiting time and expense happens only in the first and last steps.  Buy Bitcoin -&gt; Spend Bitcoin -&gt; Save leftover until you need to spend some more.  Discover the second time that without all the hassle of dealing with fiat, everything goes super smooth.  Duh.
5.  Yes, Bitcoin discounts are going to happen so that financially privileged Westerners have more incentive to get into Bitcoin.  See:  Recent Newegg and Dell discounts of 10% for using Bitcoin.  Note that just because you and your mother happen to be financially privileged, most people aren't, so they're already adopting Bitcoin without waiting around to complain that it's so useless.

Even better, find someone who supports Bitcoin in real life and have a conversation with them.  Go to a Bitcoin meet up or something, shouldn't be hard to find some in your area.
The only way you will be treated poorly on any Bitcoin forum is if you're either completely stupid and don't read a little bit about your area of concern first, or if you're obviously just being a malicious waste of time, as detailed above.  In fact, Bitcoiners are very nice to newbies I feel, since they all understand they used to be new themselves once and frequently are happy to share a little Bitcoin to get someone started.

In some ways, Bitcoin is TOO advanced and we're still catching up to how to use it properly.
Exchanges and company held wallets are stopgap measures while we build decentralised systems and educate a population that is used to a paradigm of banks and central points of failure.
The whole "be your own bank" idea actually really is that.  With Bitcoin you can literally securely your money more safely than someone else who invests millions in doing so, because it's really not that hard to do and the other person adds an additional point of failure. 


This is why there is an idea that Bitcoin will severely curtail or remove banks and/or government in the long run.  As well as removing the power to inflate the money supply, Bitcoin makes it more efficient and secure to be a wealth storing individual than a wealth storing institution (up to any amount of money), which is the complete opposite of how it has been for the rest of human history.

You're thinking too much inside the system.  The solution is not making Bitcoin palatable by encouraging it for some and discouraging it for others.  Bitcoin doesn't benefit from seeking approval, and shouldn't try to.
Those who want to ban it will want to do so no matter if it's entirely used by drug dealers or not at all.  Because the issue isn't drug dealers, it's control of the financial system.
Those who want it to flourish will want it to do so no matter if it's entirely used by drug dealers or not at all.  Because the issue isn't about drug dealers, it's about control of the financial system.
What should be done is to ensure as many people as possible learn about Bitcoin, are given a little to play around with, see the advantages of the technology.  Drug dealers and farmers alike.
And by the time the government or banks wake up to what's going on,  everyone else will think their concern is ridiculous.  And that's if the bankers and public servants don't clue in that individually they benefit from Bitcoin and defect against the policy of their parent institution.

A block is a collection of valid transactions, plus a nonce that is "guessed" (that's Bitcoin's proof of work) and put through a hash function, which then satisfies the difficulty requirement of the network.
All the past transactions are in previous blocks, and that's why it's called the blockchain.

Even if one of the current exchanges collapsed in the next bubble (already less likely because the ones today are made of sterner stuff), not only are it's competitors more solid but much, much more numerous and the spread of Bitcoin means there's far more activity on localbitcoins, Mycelium local trader etc.  The market could probably take losing an exchange today, whereas before it was such a centralised point of failure that it stopped at least 3 bubbles mid-surge.

Bitcoin is all about choice.  If you choose not to use it, at least it was voluntary and noone's shoving a gun down your throat to make sure you didn't.
Not to mention every transaction has a buyer, so clearly someone at the school wanted some.
And if the son understands he will have regular Bitcoin coming in, and can make a profit on exchanging it for fiat, I'd think that was a win too.  Sounds like an intelligent lad.

If the gold is traded directly, you don't have portability but do have the guarantee of holding the actual commodity.
If paper substitutes are traded instead, you gain portability but lose the guarantee of holding the actual commodity.
Bitcoin fixes this, because you can have both the portability and the guarantee of holding the actual commodity.

So many Bitcoin critics statements should just be appended with '...yet'.  If you took everything they said two years ago and added that, by now they'd all be wrong.  They're all wrong anyway, but the lack of 'yet' shows how some people really struggle to extrapolate from current trends.

The world is flat, most experts agree in 1100.
Man will never run the 4 minute mile, most experts agree in 1950.
There is no forthcoming economic crisis, most experts agree in 2006.
Yes, experts are experts for a reason, and it's foolish to completely ignore their position without good reason.  But it's also the nature of experts that they tend to consider new things within the parameters of what they already understand or believe, and not look to things that might break or be outside that understanding.
That's why "experts" and economists hate Bitcoin, and VC investors and the tech community love it.  One is a afraid of change, and the other is exhilirated by it.

Which is a big if.
And is why Bitcoin &gt; Gold, because why have blockchain credits potentially representing gold, when you could have Bitcoin that definitely is Bitcoin instead?  
Both will have identical utility value the 99.99% of the time you don't want to exchange the gold credits for gold, and once people realise that holding physical gold is overrated compared to storing Bitcoin, they won't want the physical gold anyway.

Not to mention opportunity cost.  You can be on MySpace and Facebook simultaneously to hedge your bets as people start to shift over.  But you can only hold one crypto with the same "value", having more Bitcoin necessarily means having less Litecoin.
Of course you can split your savings between them, but network effects mean it's proportionally better to have most in Bitcoin, which just snowballs into it's better to have all of it in Bitcoin.

The only driver of price is hodling.
If everyone on the planet spent, the price would be 0, or marginally above it, subject only to the enormous number of people that would need to hold it just long enough to spend it.
If everyone on the planet held/hodled/saved/'hoarded' Bitcoin, the price would be at the moon.
The price rises indirectly when services are built (making it easier for holders, or incentivising people to become holders, or convincing them that holding is a good idea) or merchants see extra income as a result of the Bitcoin community (perhaps they don't cash out all to fiat, or their good experience prompts another merchant to adopt), but only because that increases the number of holders.
Bitcoin 2.0 projects are the same, they can impact the price indirectly by generating more demand to hold Bitcoin.

Not every Bitcoin vendor is alike.  So Coinjar is probably a little bit safer and cheaper, but takes longer to verify and isn't "anonymous".

It is a zero sum game.  Holding one currency, fiat or crypto, comes at the high opportunity cost of holding every other one.
Of course you can make a profit if you get in and out of an alternative crypto built on hype and big promises at the right times.  Should any of those coins be expected to be more valuable against Bitcoin in 5 years or 10 years?  No, unless they are so innovative and amazing that they replace Bitcoin.  Thus, the whole alt coin market is pure "greater fool" speculation, it's possible to make a profit but not on fundamentals and not by buying and hodling, because they're all going to zero.
You can see this as over time the share of Bitcoin's market cap relative to the combined market cap of all other cryptos is increasing, despite the incessant proliferation of new alt coins and new features.  I can't find a chart showing BTC vs all other alts simultaneously, but they all follow the same pattern so let's take LTC as an example.
Except when Bitcoin itself spikes, as a new crowd of inexperienced crypto investors (more "greater fools" to prop up the alt coin market) enter the the Bitcoin market, LTC does nothing but drop against BTC.
One currency to rule them all.

Litecoin wasn't even ballsy enough to try that, and instead said they were "silver to Bitcoin's gold", except that weightlessness and infinite divisibility means there is no need for an alternative, less valuable tag-along with cryptocurrencies.

A combination of "because they can't" and "they're underestimating it" basically.


No, they can't.  Once Bitcoin reaches a certain level of education, development and adoption, trying to restrict or shut it down within that country will cause a massive backlash.  Not to mention the whole system is so anti fragile that it's very, very difficult / impossible to stop it growing, advancing or adapting.
Even if it were banned in one country, it will just keep growing everywhere else until it's so big that the formerly banned countries have to change their stance or drown in the tide.

The price does matter, but it matters a lot more to new adopters (who haven't had long enough to realise they're just going to settle in for the long term) than old hands (who understand the bubble cycle and see adoption/improvement exploding and aren't worried if the price drops a bit or a lot).
Hence, when the price goes up, we get lots of new adopters, who up vote "price is rising" posts.
When the price goes down, the weak hands fold, and there is more up votes of "this cool thing happened with adoption / the technology".
In any case, both camps like the price to go up, and both camps like the technology to improve/spread.  There's nothing wrong with either of those, and it's not contradictory that sometimes one group has more influence and sometimes the other does.

If something is very similar to Bitcoin, it loses to Bitcoin's network effect or can be incorporated in.
If it is very different, it can't make efficient use of existing open source code.
You can't have it both ways, that the coin is similar enough to use existing infrastructure but so different that Bitcoin can't swallow it.


Not a large threat, because Bitcoin is big and conservative by nature.  Either side chains will make this not an issue, or only the very, very best of alt coin developments that survive the darwinian evolution of the marketplace will get included in Bitcoin.


Yes this is an issue, but efficiency in ASIC hardware improvements is rapidly slowing. ASICs will become commodified and easier to purchase, plus larger companies in the space are all incentivised to run mining equipment at a loss to ensure the viability of their core product (Bitcoin) in the same way they are to contribute to dev costs.  
This is all theoretical anyway since the incentive structure has held so far and nobody has proposed anything convincingly better.


Bitcoin's biggest believers hodl and accumulate more of it, that's one of its greatest strengths not a weakness.  I agree the utility will outpace speculation as its source of value over time though.

I don't think there's any circumstance where that occurs.  If someone is benevolent and finds an exploit, they immediately report it, probably because they also hold Bitcoin and want the system to be secure.  If they're malicious and find an exploit, they immediately look for a way to profit.
What motivation would anyone have to look for an exploit, find it, and then do nothing?
Even in the case where they did, the system is still secure (no ones money will be stolen) if its only holes are known to people who aren't going to take advantage of it.  If someone else finds the hole or the knowledgeable person's motivation changes, then refer to the case explained above.

I don't understand why we get these posts every single week.  One of the following:  
* Why is the price going down?
* Why is the price going up?
* Why is the price staying stable?
Someone will post "manipulation", someone else will post "whales", someone else will post "&lt;piece of recent news&gt;".
The answer is always supply/demand, and that's all we can be sure of.
Even if we could find the answer, who cares, because it will be different next week anyway.

You were doing well up until "trying to sell it to suckers for $400..."
I don't believe any assets given out here are being sold, it's just to demonstrate the technology.
And in future, any assets that were sold would have a price determined entirely by the market, as they can be simply transferred and acquired by anyone.  I can imagine something like a company stock being issued that would have a standing buy order from the issuing company at a little below market value and a floating market exchange rate above that.
edit:  turns out OP is selling $400 blue coins...  Incredible

Bitcoin addresses can be generated on paper and so can Bitcoin transactions, although it'd presumably be complicated and difficult.  Think 'offline signing', but without the computer to do the heavy lifting.
Edit:  In fact since Bitcoin is all math, you could even 'mine' on paper and broadcast messages via smoke signal and "Bitcoin" would still "work" fine.
There is no electricity requirement for Bitcoin conceptually at least, although it doesn't really work that way in practice.
All Bitcoin theoretically requires is a method of peer to peer communication and a way of storing information at each peer.  It's just that the Internet is the best peer to peer communication and computer hard drives the best way of storing information humanity currently has available en-masse.

This x1000.
Buttcoiners lol at Bitcoin constantly for being in negative news or being joked about.
Meanwhile, they don't realise that Bitcoin constantly increases its legitimacy by being mentioned, no matter the context.  It's hard to deny something "doesn't work" or "isn't real" if you've heard about it 10 times instead of once.
 
^^ This thread is amazing, turns out a random sample of redditors is actually familiar enough with Bitcoin to appreciate jokes about it.  They understand that it's a volatile currency currently at low adoption.  In some of the smaller branches, they are even asking questions and getting accurate replies.  Buttcoiners can laugh all they want, this is a far cry from "What's a Bitcoin?" and/or "That ponzi scam, down vote".
It only takes 1% of people hearing anything about it to google "What is Bitcoin?" to continue the spread of knowledge, and it seems we're doing at least that well.
inb4 "but the price doesn't agree" or "so you're going to say, this is actually good for Bitcoin?", yes, yes it is
Edit:  As expected, the Buttcoin crowd have chimed in.
The difference between Bitcoin and beanie babies / almost anything else it can be compared to is that no one started out saying "But Beanie babies aren't a real thing!  They're never going to work!", and then started saying "Well, it's really the *manufacturing process* that's important, not the Beanie babies themselves", and then eventually came to "Well, I'll admit, Beanie babies are a world changing idea".  
I remember the last time several world governments held public committees on Beanie babies. /s
In addition, guess what, an enormous percentage of the population knows about Beanie babies, Nigerian prince scams and even Lord Voldemort.  If those things had any utility to people, they would spread rapidly because there'd be no back and forth about "is that a real thing?" or "Is it going to fail?" or "What I've never heard of that?"
The Buttcoiners will never understand though, because anytime they're wrong they just move the goalposts.  6 months ago, the debate was "Bitcoin isn't a real thing."  Today, it's "Bitcoin is never going to be popular / doesn't have enough utility value yet for the average consumer".
@_date: 2014-07-29 18:37:36
Why?  Bitcoin is growing despite having low liquidity, so we can conclude that its other attributes make it superior to more liquid currencies like the USD.
At what point does Bitcoin **stop** growing?  Is there a point at which everyone on the earth agrees, "Well, 1 in 50 merchants and 1 in 23.2 consumers uses Bitcoin, that's the perfect amount, no one else get involved!!"  Fiat currencies stop around the national geographic borders, but Bitcoin doesn't have any of those.  The closest thing it does have is number of global citizens with an internet connection, and that's a few billion with the rest being brought onboard about as fast as we can manage.
The case for Bitcoin will only get stronger over time, and if it's good enough to grow exponentially now then I can't see what's going to stop it.
There are no social or economic reasons (thanks, near-infinite divisibility) Bitcoin could not encompass all of world commerce today.  There are technical limitations to the technology, but we're already seeing workarounds (eg. off blockchain transactions, use of altcoins "backed" by Bitcoin) and proposals for improvement (eg. side chains / tree chains) on that front.  Just like the Internet in the early days, I think what is possible is much much greater than what we have right now.










@_date: 2014-12-14 19:17:40
Consensus on the network.
That's the whole point of Bitcoin, the computers don't just individually decide "screw the rest of you, I want to have my own blockchain", they *always* defer to the majority consensus.  And even if one did, it wouldn't matter, unless you infect the majority of the network to not defer to majority consensus, which is a big ask.
This means if an erroneous change got to majority consensus, it would be accepted (and no longer erroneous).  It also means it's impossible to get an erroneous change to majority consensus unless you can convince the majority of nodes in a very short time period to defect or fool them that they are in the majority when they aren't.  That's a big ask.
EDIT:  One computer being fooled can never convince another *against* the consensus of the network, which seems to be what you don't understand.  Since all nodes have multiple connections open, one defector (or even a substantial minority) ends up just being ignored by the majority, and the defection never spreads because of the Catch 22 that nodes don't listen to defectors in the minority, and defectors in the minority aren't listened to so they stay the minority.

This is exactly my point.  Every single person that had their money in Mt Gox made a choice to do so, with plenty of other options, and if they weren't aware of the risks that was their own fault.  I remember mountains of cynicism about Mt Gox all throughout its history, but on that we just have to agree to disagree.  
If I play Russian Roulette and blow my own brains out do you suppose it's everyone else's fault noone gave me a physics lesson explaining the dangers of bullets?  It's on the participant to make a risk assessment with activities they get involved in, not society to educate every single person about every single kind of risk.
I also think every single Mt Gox victim would take the loss of their Bitcoin over getting smashed into by a 4 wheel drive with a drunk driver without question.

Yes, and while the Buttcoiners will spin it as a negative, what they don't realise is tapping into human vices is a force of incredible power.
Bitcoin adoption might not be "moral" and based on appeals to logic, reason and cryptographic/economic understanding (although ironically the community does try plenty of this), but it is going to happen.
Never bet against greed.
This is also what the "but the system is biased to early adopters!" crowd don't get either. Yes, it's biased to early adopters, that's what got it adopted. A system that rewards the later adopters doesn't ever get off the ground, or everyone would be competing to be the last in rather than the first in.

You might need to re-read the linked article more carefully, the argument is not that Satoshi mined all of the early blocks.  Just that he mined a lot, and we can pick which ones he did.
If he mined them and they haven't moved (they haven't), then he still controls them, unless he destroyed the keys (deliberately or not).  If he gave the keys to someone else, then they control them, but he would also still have control unless he not only gave away the keys but destroyed his own copy.

I'm not, they can pick the pool they like, and if they want to be sure of what code that is then they'll have to mine on their own, move to a pool that is open (I don't know if any are), or start their own pool that is open about what code they run.
Of course your reply will be "but that isn't practical/profitable!!", which it isn't, but it demonstrates that there isn't enough care in the mining community about which software is being run that they'll abandon pools to encourage transparency.
That may or may not be a good thing, but it's what the majority agree on, so here we are.

I agree with you.  Most Bitcoin skeptics are so just out of ignorance, and almost all of us here started out that way too.  The community is actually very understanding about that.
But it's very very hard to be a regular Bitcoin and Buttcoin poster for months on end and still not have plenty of opportunity to see Bitcoin's utility, potential and growth.

A difficulty of 1.  That's what the difficulty started at when Satoshi started mining on his laptop or whatever way back in the day.  Processed transactions fine.

If anything, I think the distribution is great for Bitcoin.
Why?  Those with most of the coins are the ones with the very strongest belief in the technology and the ideals behind Bitcoin's creation.  To have any sizeable stake in Bitcoin requires either a large financial investment, or to have been in very, very early or both.  In either case, if they still have the coins, it's because they held faithful through multiple catastrophic looking price crashes and thousands of times being told they were completely stupid by everyone else in their life.
And what do our new wealthy overlords do with their reward?  Why, spend it on spreading both Bitcoin and the ideals it represents.  The Bitcoin rich that I know of, eg. Eric Voorhees, Roger Ver and Olivier Janssens all spend their money investing back in the Bitcoin space.
For example: [The $100 000 reward for decentralising the Bitcoin Foundation](

I feel you're mistaking "concern trolling" with "legitimate criticism".
Bitcoin gets plenty of legitimate criticism from people like the core devs, who see the value in Bitcoin and want to make it more robust.  This doesn't ever get down voted when posted, although it's not common.  It tends to happen mostly on the Github page, developer mailing list etc. instead as far as I'm aware.
Most other "criticism" is just thinly veiled concern trolling, when ultra persistent posters of unknown motivation constantly try and scream the sky is falling due to an endless litany of "problems" that can never be satisfactorily addressed (according to the troll, who will just move the issue every time their concern is addressed).
A recent example of this from Common "criticisms" that get down voted because there's known solutions / it's not really a problem / the asker doesn't get it yet include:
* Mining centralisation (Guaranteed Ghashcoin, yes that lasted didn't it)
* Blockchain size increasing (Bitcoin will never work, but if it did it couldn't handle Visa scale traffic tomorrow!!)
* It's only used for drugs / not enough merchants accept it / not big enough merchants accept it / not enough merchants in my area accept it (endless goal post shifting)
* It's volatile (it's getting more popular in waves, thus volatility.  I guess the trolls think it can continue its exponential growth while remaining perfectly stable on the free market against other currencies)
* Development only rests in the hands of a few (Bitcoin is still small, and not one of the trolls has ever decided to proactively fix this problem by contributing any code themselves)
* Coin XYZ has feature that Bitcoin never has / Bitcoin 2.0 will magically appear from God and Bitcoin will be worthless (network effects, forkability of code, sidechains etc.)
* It's reputation is too poor, the community is too fanatical, everyone believes it's a Ponzi scheme etc. (well we're growing exponentially, so there's that.  Also: misinformed is preferable to ignorance, since it's only possible to move in one direction on the unaware &gt; misinformed &gt; informed progression.  The community is only surviving and thriving in the face of endless criticism and mockery because it is at times and in parts very hardcore, and that's great)
* Confirmation times are too slow (10 minute block time &gt; 3 month Credit Card confirm, 0 conf transactions, multisig, third party backers for POS transactions etc.)
List not exhaustive.
Edit:  Also, any other variant of "I just discovered Bitcoin and I think XYZ (especially incentive scheme / code / economics / community) needs to be changed for Bitcoin to succeed."
No, it doesn't.  Everything in Bitcoin is the way it is for very good reasons, it's been doing incredibly well on a multi-year timeframe, and if you've only found out about Bitcoin five minutes ago you definitely have not spotted a critical flaw in the incentive scheme, code, economics or community that the millions of people who know more about Bitcoin than you have not.  Think on it some more and do some more reading.
Edit 2:  I'm 2 for 2 in getting gold for shooting down Bitcoin critics.  I should do this for a living.  I for one embrace my new gilding overlords.
Edit 3:  has arrived in the comments below to provide an example on this actual post of concern trolling.  Thanks mate.  I assume the irony of this situation escapes him/her.
Edit 4:  Note the persistence of who consistently starts posts with an outright, strong sounding denial like "Bullshit!" that appears authoritative to people who don't know better, then a bit of "well you're all delusional because you obviously just ignore any inconvenient truths / critics", and then concludes the rather short post with some kind of "but &lt;qualifies or finds a new exception outside the scope of the previously addressed concern&gt;".  This can continue ad-infinitum, which is why it's better to just down vote and ignore.
The ultimate irony of all the critics claims that is such a cult is that the mods here are very lax about allowing obviously malicious, persistent individuals to continue posting and be heard (and the community just hits them with down votes most of the time when they don't have a valid point).  Head over to and you'll find they've got their CSS set up to hide the down vote arrow, but if you post anything pro Bitcoin somehow you still end up getting down voted.  Obviously they switch it on for their own circle jerkers and leave it off for the rest of us.  It's ludicrously hypocritical.

Today, Ebay CEO:  "Yeah I own Bitcoin, and digital currencies are an inevitable next step."
Can't you see where this is heading?  The world where everyone can purchase all the goods and services they need, and merchants can use it to pay their suppliers, is arriving like a freight train.  Overstock is currently holding around 10% of the Bitcoin payments they receive, and I believe I saw Patrick Byrne talk about negotiating with suppliers to close the loop.  They've been accepting Bitcoin just under 6 months.

* Reverse transactions that he sends while he's in control. This has the potential to double-spend transactions that previously had already been seen in the block chain.
* Prevent some or all transactions from gaining any confirmations
* Prevent some or all other miners from mining any valid blocks


* Reverse other people's transactions
* Prevent transactions from being sent at all (they'll show as 0/unconfirmed)
* Change the number of coins generated per block
* Create coins out of thin air
* Send coins that never belonged to him

Transaction volume I'm not that concerned by, as it appears to have barely moved its average value since 2010, and if you think Bitcoin was the same then as it is now you're a lunatic.

* In six months I have watched the number of subscribers double.
* I have also watched the price double.
* In the last nine months I have seen Bitcoin go from a *blank stare* to "Yeah I've heard of that" and even an occasional "Sure, I'll take some."  Several of my friends have become strong believers, and my family is past the tipping point of skepticism.
* I have seen the development of all of the Bitcoin infrastructure at what is really quite a remarkable pace given it's mostly built by volunteers.
* Just yesterday I saw my first Bitcoin ATM in my local area.
* Merchant acceptance eg. Dell, Overstock would not have even been conceivable 9 months ago

Except the present is not an arbitrary moment to end the timeframe.  It's the present, and the fact it has its own description means it's not arbitrary rather than a relative timeframe like "2 months" or a randomly chosen point like "21st May 2012" (with no reasoning for why that moment was chosen).
Neither is the moment Bitcoin was invented.  By your logic it's pretty arbitrary to start in 2008/2009, when the Google Search graph should go back to the Big Bang (I guess that's pretty arbitrary too).
TL:DR; You need to learn what the word "arbitrary" means.

Could you give some numbers to back that up?
For a start, Bitcoin has no storage fees, management fees, or miscellaneous charges of any kind.  Just transaction fees, and it costs the same to send next door as overseas, and is irrespective of the value to be sent (ie. 1 satoshi will take the same flat fee as 1000 BTC to be transmitted).  None of that is true of Visa or banks.
Also, the whole point of Bitcoin is that if existing players are charging a price well above operating cost, or market demand is strong for a cheaper alternative, barrier to entry is zero and the market will produce the solution.
This is not true of processors like Mastercard and Visa which can rest easy in the knowledge no-one without billions to throw at the problem can afford to wade through all the government regulation to be allowed to function beyond a very small size.
The hypothetical "if you were to scale up" is also quite flawed, as there's no reason to expect that Bitcoin companies won't adjust their fees as they grow to maintain equilibrium with what the market will support.

@_date: 2014-03-06 09:00:42
Your thinking is not wrong, but you're missing several things.
1.  Bitcoin is built on the premise that it will not ultimately be fighting an eternal, losing battle against inflation.  Currently the supply is inflating, but demand is growing much faster, and new supply ultimately will stop.  This does not apply to your fiat, which is constantly losing value against real goods and services.  As a result, your salary is also in a constant losing battle to keep up with prices.  This is a hidden cost to its use that you don't see day by day, but definitely affects you over a decade or more.
2.  I wouldn't say it's true that your fiat has no transaction fees.  If you have ever used a credit card, at a lot of merchants that comes with an extra fee.  In addition, the "transaction fee" on cash you pay at merchants that accept credit cards is an overall higher price, to compensate for the percentage of chargeback frauds or time arguing with Paypal that the merchant swallows.  The fee is still there, it's just invisible to you because it's included in the price.  Unless you deal 100% in cash, then you presumably have a bank account, which not only charges storage fees, but likely also transaction fees on transfers (especially international ones).  Maybe you don't do these much, but that's probably more because it's inconvenient and expensive than because you would have no use for that function.  I've started buying from (and donating Bitcoin to) other countries more and more since I've been able to use Bitcoin, simply because I can.
3.  There is no reason the fiat price of goods has to be the 'equivalent' by market exchange rate in Bitcoin.  The 'price' can be different to accommodate the different properties of an inflationary vs deflationary currency.  This is why some vendors are offering discounts if you pay in Bitcoin, and as more and more vendors enter the market there will be more and more competition to do so.
4.  Your problem is a temporary one.  You're right, if you got paid in Bitcoin you wouldn't have this issue.  Change that!  Ask your boss if you can get paid in Bitcoin, or if you're self-employed look into Bitpay, Coinbase or even just direct transfers to start getting paid.  You won't look back, I promise.

I have also been thinking recently on how for Bitcoin to just shoot straight to the moon only requires 15 million people (in the next couple of years) to want a whole Bitcoin enough not to give it up at any fiat price.
Now take out Satoshi's million, the 2-3 million that were lost or sent to the abyss in the early days, the million the Winklevoss and a bunch of other large hodlers own and we're down to 11 million Bitcoinaires.  But even most of the smaller hodlers have a couple, and plenty have 10s, 100s or 1000s.  
I really do think the actual Bitcoin community worldwide must be less than a million, and that by the time we get to five we will know because this subreddit will be flooded with posts saying "I wish I'd clued in a year ago when I heard about this and could have bought a whole Bitcoin!"
Currently, posts saying "I just joined the 21 million club!" are not that infrequent.
This cannot last.
The 21 million club cannot hold 21 million people, probably not even 5 million.
I'm glad to be here now.  At least two of my friends have also become hellbent on getting into the club, and another two have already made it in.  The on-ramp can't stay climbable to the average punter for much longer.  Who knows when things will tip, but it's happening pretty quickly.

Plenty of first world countries have near complete Internet penetration.  It also took around 20 years to get that installed, and that involved wiring the entire thing together.

Payment processors are an intermediate step to Bitcoin adoption.  They may stay important to the ecosystem, or they may eventually transition to other services as people become familiar with Bitcoin and it becomes a unit of account, as well as a store of value and medium of transfer.
Bitcoin is volatile at the moment, and the legal environment is very uncertain, so it's absolutely a good thing we have payment processors.  Accepting Bitcoin via a payment processor is better than not at all, and is a strong step towards accepting Bitcoin p2p.
You can't expect everyone to just jump straight to using Bitcoin as it was intended, there are too many entrenched interests and old habits die hard.  
Also, the Bitcoin ecosystem is young so there's not as many Bitcoin companies or well funded mining pools as there eventually will be.

Is a GEM supposed to have a fixed exchange rate for Bitcoin?  
If no, it's value will collapse on the free market against BTC like every other alt coin.  It's a pre mined scam.  This will not end well, and Gems will not end up "bringing crypto to the masses" but rather teaching more people that crypto is all Ponzi scheme and no substance.
If yes, are you telling me that the Gems team is introducing itself as a centralised reserve Bitcoin bank via GEMs for literally no additional advantages over just Bitcoin?  Why would I hold GEMs (supposedly good for transferring value) representing Bitcoin for the privilege of watching ads, instead of just holding Bitcoin (actually good for transferring value).
@_date: 2014-10-25 03:20:50
The exact opposite.
Money functions as a store of value, a means of payment and a unit of account.  In that order.
Bitcoin is currently transitioning into the second function, and once well enough established there will begin to move into the third.  Note that that might not be for a while, it might even require most of the world to exclusively transact in Bitcoin, but there's no reason we can't denominate value in legacy currencies for as long as needed until that happens.

I am amazed at the people who are panicking that the price is down, when I'm starting to see Bitcoin bubble (hehe) through in lots of places around me.
In small social situations, offhand references to friends who regularly settle beer debts with me in Bitcoin make others' prick up their ears accompanied by a flash of recognition and "Did I just hear that right?" cross their face.  We don't make a big production of it and you can see the "I should Google this later..." wheels start turning.
A new Bitcoin ATM has been installed at my local shopping centre in a particularly high traffic area.  I've yet to see anyone use it, besides a friend and I disappointedly discovering the need for photo ID, but its mere presence must put the Bitcoin logo and name in thousands of minds every day.
Comment sections on finance related topics across a wide variety of internet forums and blogs seem to consistently have Bitcoin mentioned in the comments, even without it being an comment brigade. The typical ignorant responses of "that Ponzi scheme that's worth nothing" also seem to be fading away more rapidly than I'd expect, in place of some cautiously skeptical responses like the classic "but it's the blockchain TECHNOLOGY that will be big and not necessarily Bitcoin" or just no responses at all. I've seen multiple Disqus commenters with some kind of Bitcoin logo/symbol as their avatar.
I put The Rise And Rise Of Bitcoin on the TV in my apartment, and 3/4 of the present guests/housemates were quietly curious, while the other was openly scornful but stuck around to watch another 20 minutes of it anyway, to continue explaining how stupid it was.  It's obviously never going to work, after all, it's so irrelevant and guaranteed to fail that someone made a documentary about it and all of us were watching it.
All small things, in my one small corner of the planet, but this social transition is a very very stark contrast to when I first got excited about Bitcoin in early November last year, and the extreme skepticism that seemed to be the norm even with the price doing extremely well.

What if I told you that the only reason you're concerned is because you are seeing it the wrong way around.  You're still living in a paradigm where you measure by USD, rather than by Bitcoin.
Once you measure things against Bitcoin, rather than Bitcoin against other things it all makes a lot more sense.

Maybe not this week, or this month, or this year, but in ten years time you'll find you are living in a very different world.

"Intrinsic value" is such a myth, it should really be called utility value.  And Bitcoin has that in spades.
All value is subjective, I personally don't like gold jewellery and if the rest of the world felt the same then gold would have no "intrinsic" value.
Gold has utility value as a currency, and also in jewellery, electronics etc.
Bitcoin has utility value as a currency.
If Bitcoin's lack of "physical utility" value automatically makes it a bubble, then gold is the exact same.  The overwhelming majority of gold's market demand comes from investors, not jewellery producers.  In fact the lack of "physical utility" makes Bitcoin even more remarkable as a currency, because it's evidently so good at that it didn't even need another purpose to become tradeable.

The exact opposite: a bubble will happen when everyone is convinced it is about to.
Then all the sellers vanish at anything approaching the current price, the buying price skyrockets, more people further up the selling chain decide they've put their bid in too low and also cancel their sells, and voila - a bubble.
A bubble will not happen so long as there's still enough sellers who think it won't.

Every 10 minutes, an unalterable block is added into the chain of existing blocks by computers running software (miners) - thus "blockchain".  
This blockchain is stored permanently on all miners/network nodes computers, and cannot be unwritten.  Everyone agrees on this past history with no requirement to trust each other, that's the whole breakthrough that everyone is excited about.
Each block in the blockchain is filled with valid information according to the rules of the network.  In Bitcoin this is transactions from A -&gt; B, but could be any other form of information.  For instance Bitmessage uses the same concept to create a decentralised e-mail service.
For the first time in history, a potentially infinite group of people can now agree on something without ever having met, and without trusting each other at all.  Everyone must follow the rules established by the network and supported by a majority of users, and no one has an ability to coerce the network into something most users don't agree with.  Being geographically distributed, it's also very hard to take down the network.
This has created Bitcoin, the world's first global currency.  The limits of what else can be achieved are at the moment beyond anyone's imagination, but some small uses are starting to show up eg. decentralised, secure messaging (Bitmessage) or perhaps a replacement for TCP/IP.

1.  Yes, that's the idea.
2.  Yes, I believe so.
3.  Yes, which is why much like existing alt coins there will be a strong desire for code to be open-sourced and peer-reviewed, and all users will have to be responsible in determining where they put their money.  The stupid ones won't have the money for very much longer.
4.  Depends on who is mining that side chain.  If the malicious actors have 51% of the hashing power, probably.

The difference is you can be killed by a car someone else is driving, as well as one you chose to get into and/or are driving.
In Bitcoin, you can only be burnt by things you choose to get involved with, there's no way someone else's Bitcoin can hurt you.
Plus comparing losing a few $$ because of your own idiocy to a brutal death at someone else's hands is a bit dramatic in any case.

Even if the dev team disappeared over night, things would not immediately go haywire.
For a start, we've got a system that runs "well enough", so worst case scenario everyone can just stick with what's already happening.  The miners are responsible for keeping consensus on which transactions are valid, which is only indirectly influenced by the devs.  A fork in the codebase does not require a fork in the mining, unless there is a significant percentage of miners that think an upgraded fork is better than the current version.
Also, 10 000 different forks of the code may happen, that's fantastic!  That's innovation without permission, and the better options to upgrade to will rise to the top.  Eventually the very very best will be considered a candidate for upgrading the network, which would then involve the miners in a similar way to current Bitcoin upgrades are already done.
10 000 different forks of the network is never going to happen, because all miners have a strong incentive to be on the longest chain (or the one with the most hash power), and none to stick with a smaller one (even if they started it).  It's not about Discus fish or any mining pool wanting "their" chain to be the valid one, they don't care about that at all (unless they're trying to be malicious and double-spend, but that's a whole different problem), and will drop the chain they're working on for a bigger one in a heartbeat if they see it.  This of course works in a snowball effect, either a network hash rate imbalance, or just the luck involved in finding a new block, will quickly give an edge to one chain over another and the smaller will be absorbed.  So in the case of a split the miners tend to aggregate down to just two options very very quickly, and agree on one soon after that.
If 5 forks are all 20%, as described they will merge very quickly, prompted either by imbalanced "luck" in finding the blocks, or a non-perfect-distribution of hash rate.  While this was happening though, none of them would be the "main blockchain", and none of them are building a "side chain", they're all just building a blockchain.  Which one is the "main blockchain" only becomes apparent in retrospect when one comes out as the longest chain.  None of the block chains are at any time a "side chain", which is a completely different concept.
Hopefully that answered your question.

Bitcoin is not going to attack other digital currencies, it will just absorb them over time.
Bitcoin does not stop other currencies gaining adoption and value, but as we're seeing, those are both dropping over time (thanks to... the network effect). 
I'm not going to type out a whole explanation of these two phenomena, as that's exactly what the two posts I linked to explain.


Just like Bitpay and Coinbase.  Because they are companies, and not currencies.
inb4 "But the USD and the Euro coexist!"  Yes, but only because they have geographical constraints to their growth, backed by government violence.  Bitcoin (or any other crypto currency) has no such constraints.
One coin to rule them all.


Yes, Dogecoin does diminish Bitcoin's value.  Only a little bit, because the Dogecoin market cap is tiny compared to Bitcoin's, but it still does because all the people hodling Doge could instead be hodling BTC, increasing its liquidity.
As we can see from the occasional "I have switched from Doge" posts, and more importantly the ever dropping price of Doge, this is happening naturally.

They would be sent across the network and put in the transaction mempool, but most likely not included in a block and thus not end up in the blockchain.
I'm not aware of any spam filtering mechanism on the transaction mempool, but transactions that sit there too long (e.g. 100 000 spam transactions) eventually get dropped from consideration for inclusion in the next block.

Well, Twitter did grow largely on the back of the 15 - 25 demographic, and is now a mainstay feature of global culture.  The government sponsored news where I live has a segment reporting on the latest trends on Twitter.  You better believe the mainstay audience is ages 30 - 50, and most of them don't have a Twitter account, but they understand that it's important they at least know what's going on with such an important communication medium.
The uprisings in places like Egypt and Turkey have also been greatly facilitated by Twitter and other social media services.

Were other social networks called social networks before Facebook?  I have a strong suspicion that Facebook popularised the term "social network" and it was then retroactively applied to other similar sites like MySpace and Bebo.  In one sense, that DOES make it the first social network.  Could be wrong though, but I can't remember hearing about "social networks" before Facebook was huge.

Bitcoin =/= Paypal.
Bitcoin == USD.
Paypal is an escrow service that you trust on top of the USD.  Your trust of the USD is so complete that you didn't even think to include it in your comparison.
Comparable escrow services for Bitcoin are just beginning to be developed, see for example the recent work in reputation systems on OpenBazaar, and once they are a bit better developed you can learn to trust one of those for all of your Bitcoin merchant escrow needs, just as you have for Paypal.  To some degree, this is what some people already use Coinbase for (Coinbase vets their affiliated merchants and of course monitors them for any recurring issues).
In fact you might even discover with less stringent controls on currency moderation, that you gravitate to a number of different escrow operators depending on their specialty and the type of transactions they facilitate.  Or maybe you'll just stick with one.  But at least you have the choice.

You gotta be less stressed about the price.
Every time I introduce a friend it's about the most tangential thing "yeah, look let me hit you up with $1, just try it out."
Then brief mention that Bitcoin is new, the price is volatile, maybe it's got potential, and they should do some research on their own, and look at that now your Mycelium wallet is receiving money and that was way quicker than PayPal.
Then move on to something else.  They'll think through what happened in their own time.

@_date: 2014-11-11 12:31:42
It's true, Bitcoin is never likely to change it's basic properties.  
But volatility is not one of Bitcoin's basic properties.  It's a function of its small market cap, relative youth and unknown potential.  It's not written into the code that Bitcoin has to be volatile.  Over time, volatility (has and) will decrease.
@_date: 2014-08-16 23:39:54

1-  I have never heard of the app you are talking about.  Could you provide some information and links?  Whatever you are talking about, there is no such thing as an "official" Bitcoin app, since Bitcoin isn't a company or institution.  I would be very very wary of anything claiming to be an "official" Bitcoin anything, sounds like a scam.
2-  I still don't know what Coin is, you'll have to clear that up.  Some people store their Bitcoin with third parties like Coinbase, but this is generally not recommended as it is a security risk (a la Mt Gox) and against the principles of Bitcoin.
3-  Mining is like Bitcoin's transaction servers.  PayPal and banks spend millions on building, securing, updating and storing server farms to verify transactions and keep their networks up to date.  Miners are the Bitcoin equivalent of that, except no one is in control of all of the servers, and they are paid from new coins being created and transaction fees instead of by the profits of the bank or PayPal.
If there weren't many miners, someone with a bigger server farm could just plug into the network (because it is open to anyone), and start deciding who could send to who.  They can't, because the network is too specialised and big.  This is a good thing because the whole point of Bitcoin is that noone is in charge except the users.
4-  No other information is attached to a transaction on the blockchain (except for an optional message or extra data), but may be attached to it in someone else's records.  Again, I don't know who Coin are but when you buy something off someone else if you tell them your email address or shipping location while you pay them then obviously that party knows that that information is associated with your Bitcoin address.  What they do with that information is up to them.  Some Bitcoin services promise to destroy or not store that information to help preserve anonymity, but you're trusting that company is doing what they say.  
5-  Imagine Bitcoin is like a bank vault box with a lock on it.  Imagine your money is a gold bar sitting inside that vault box.
The Bitcoin vault box is made of glass and is completely see through.  In addition, the blueprints for the construction and security mechanisms of the box are available on the internet for anyone who wants to steal the gold bar to inspect in full.
Millions of people have their gold stored in the box, and all of the best vault crackers have tried to steal it with all the information about the security of the box they could ever ask for, but the gold is still in the box.  If there are any security problems, of which there doesn't seem to be, no one knows about them or the gold would have already left the box.
Conclusion: Hopefully that helps, if you have any questions, feel free to ask.  
Bonus:  You can now own a small amount of Bitcoin yourself!

From the clips I have seen, this documentary was supposed to be both educational but also a sort of 'brief history of Bitcoin' (to increase its appeal to those already familiar with the technology).  
So so so much has happened since the documentary was finished, think Dell, Overstock, Paypal, ongoing fallout from Mt Gox, Neo &amp; Bee etc. etc. etc.  As a result, the documentary has lost a lot of appeal to users familiar with the space, and will be somewhat misrepresentative of the current state of Bitcoin to those unfamiliar who will likely assume it is more current.
It's also somewhat ironic and hypocritical to come from a culture built around removing useless administration, delays, closed systems and so on but then spend a lot of time adding all those things back into your venture.  This is especially grating for those who donated on the premise that the documentary would also embrace those principles.


Absolutely, they can.  And I won't.  But since it's on the Bitcoin front page for the thousandth time with still no progress, I'm going to call it out.

10% GST on Bitcoin purchases, the entire cost of the Bitcoin, not just Coinjar's 2% transaction fee.
This not only makes tax-avoiding offshore options incredibly more attractive, it unfairly treats Bitcoin as both a product and a service for GST, rather than just one or the other.  Formerly it was just a service, hence the GST was only added to Coinjar's service charge and not the cost of the Bitcoin itself.  This seemed fairly well accepted among Australian Bitcoiners.
The result is Australian Bitcoiners buying from offshore, LESS tax being collected by the government and yet another case of governments shooting themselves in the foot at the expense of Australian business and consumers.

Mining being expensive is fantastic for the network.  The entire point of mining is to make it more worthwhile to join/cooperate with the network than start up some costly effort to scam or attack it.
People worried that mining is "too expensive" or that miners have "too much overhead" or even that miners selling coins out of necessity is a bad thing don't understand why the system is the way it is.
One thread you have people complaining that the distribution of Bitcoin is not fair, another you have people complaining the miners are diluting their share too much.  Everyone needs to realise everything is the way it is for a very good reason, and Bitcoin's exponential growth and incredible resilience is proof that while Satoshi might not have swished the shot (although the lack of a real competitor is evidence he did), he definitely did more than enough to get it into the basket and that's all that matters.

Number of my mates who accept Bitcoin for beer and food.  Currently ~8.
Other indicators I am interested in:
* Frequency of Bitcoin being mentioned on local TV stations (especially news/business type programs).  This has been increasingly common and increasingly positive/accurate over the last 12 months.
* Frequency of "Wait, I've heard of that!  I thought that was just some stupid thing on the Internet?  I should Google this..." expressions on the faces of people nearby while talking to my Bitcoin-interested friends.  This has really really picked up recently.
* Number of local businesses in my area accepting Bitcoin (~2 at the moment).
* Number of Bitcoin ATMs in my area (1).
Really the best indicators of adoption are just small things you can see in the world around you.

I wish someone had pointed me to them immediately after I joined the Bitcoin community too. This explains why Bitcoiners tend to actually dislike other crypto currencies, unless the creators admit they're no investment and just an interesting experiment.
TL:DR;  Altcoins are great for developing new applications for Bitcoin, but terrible investments.  The world wants one dominant money, and Bitcoin is too large for anything else to compete.

- Bitcoin hash rate and daily transaction volumes rocket upwards at an incredible rate
- Bitcoin ATM numbers explode from ~10 to 300+
- subscribers increase 2-4x
- Multiple governments have enquiries into crypto currencies, with Andreas a top speaker
- The alt coin bubble crashes, Bitcoin makes big gains against Litecoin, Dogecoin etc.
- Large/well recognized VC firms like Andreesen Horowitz start showing support for Bitcoin
- Bitcoin continues to spread among new user bases through the launch of changetip, with events like the and on Reddit
- Overstock starts accepting Bitcoin
- Dell starts accepting Bitcoin
- Paypal makes noise about Bitcoin, adds some minor features
- Microsoft accepts Bitcoin
Obviously also noteworthy on the other side of the coin:
- Mt Gox's implosion, and the subsequent aftermath
- Regulatory shambles of the BitLicense in NY
- Ongoing drama with China/Russia about the legality of Bitcoin
- Blockchain.info hacks
- MintPal pulling a Neo+Bee
- Wall st, Winklevoss ETF etc. stalls out amidst regulations
- Ghash gets to 51% of the hashing power, relatively rapidly reduced back to 20% as it is replaced by Chinese mining farm Discus Fish

Mining difficulty is only indirectly related to price.  Yes, mining difficulty increasing makes the network more secure, which gives more reason for people to invest, but the two are not directly linked.
Bitcoin shares several characteristics with Ponzi schemes:
* Some people have/will make a lot of money very fast
* The returns of early investors are largely contingent upon later investors
* It happens mostly on the Internet
* It is likely subject to exponential growth
But importantly does not share other characters with a Ponzi scheme:
* There is noone "at the top" who benefits from people buying into Bitcoin.  All existing holders of Bitcoin benefit when someone joins the economy and puts their labour/capital into it, just like a country's economy benefits when someone invests in their currency or moves to their country to work.
* There is no **guarantee** of future returns.  Some Bitcoin advocates will tell you that it's possible or likely that the price may increase and so investing will make you richer.  But the mantra of the community is "don't invest more than you can afford to lose", because we all recognise it's new, experimental and might turn out worthless or get replaced by something else.  I think it's unlikely, but I definitely know it's possible.
* It doesn't collapse if exponential investment does not continue.  The price might not continue increasing exponentially if adoption slows, but it won't fall to zero as there's actually an ecosystem and economy behind it, and not just returns unsustainably paid up the pyramid.
* It actually works, you really can transfer a million dollars for 5 cents to anyone anywhere in the world. That's not a promise to scam you out of your money, that's the function the network provides **right now**.

On your other points:


Not necessarily, although it's not out of the question.


Early adopters can only spend their coins into circulation once before they have to earn them back at 'market' value.  They are being rewarded for supporting a technology and providing liquidity when it was too risky for everyone else.  If they never spend the coins and die with them, what's the big deal?    


No it won't.  I'd love to hear if any other currency on the planet has an "even distribution", I don't think such a thing has ever existed.  For everyone to have the same amount of a currency requires everyone to be putting in and taking out identical amounts of value into the economy, and that's impossible.
The entire purpose of a currency is to express and quantify inequality, so I don't know why an 'even' distribution would ever be necessary.


Bitcoin already is a 'viable currency for trade', I transact in Bitcoin regularly.
Prices may never stabilise in terms of US dollars (or any other fiat currency), because Bitcoin will just continue growing until it has absorbed them.  It may stabilise in terms of goods and services though.

Yes, so if it is already using Bitcoin, why is there any need at all for Gems (the currency, not the app)?  I don't understand, even reading that link you posted.
* For rewarding users
* To pay for unsolicited messages
* For advertisers to pay for space on the network
* In app purchases
Literally all of these can be done with Bitcoin, so I don't understand why the "gems" currency is necessary at all.
Like I said, I have no problem with a "Gems" **app** powered by Bitcoin, which exists and is great.  I think it might help teenagers and women by being more visually appealing than Bitcoin QT, and that's fantastic.

You should re-read all of this.
No, Bitcoin as we know it of course doesn't work without the Internet.  But conceptually the ideas about mining, proof of work, hashing, storing block information, network propogation etc. can all be applied with pen, paper and smoke signals.  Note how I said:


the quotation marks are to indicate I'm talking about the concepts only, not the practical value transmission system with the properties we can use right now.  As I said, in reality it doesn't work that way.  In theory however, electricity is not a fundamental component to Bitcoin.  Bitcoin the concept (aka decentralised consensus) can be implemented via any communication network, provided there is a way to store information at each node.  That could be smoke signals for the communication network, and pen and paper and a couple of people good at maths and scribing at each node.


Exactly, the block chain doesn't require electricity either, and can be recorded on pen and paper.  Not at anything like the speed it is now, but it could be done.

Do you realise that these two points are contradictory?  Those with a lot of Bitcoin will just end up with a lot more, because they'll split all their holdings down and receive more of the distribution.
Not to mention that the distribution of Bitcoin isn't a problem anyway.  The market has spent 5 years distributing Bitcoin to the strongest hands it can, and that's great.  The trolls whine about "unequal distribution", and then don't take the opportunity to become part of that distribution when the price drops because "it's all worthless anyway".  
In fact, Bitcoin's distribution is great, because those with the most coins have the strongest belief in Bitcoin's ideals, and when/once they become rich, they use their money to continue propagating those ideals.  See: Roger Ver, Eric Voorhes etc.


While killing off all of the shitty exchanges is a good idea, doing so all at once would be pretty catastrophic and unlikely to help Bitcoin, as the sudden burden on "solid" exchanges might just create even more issues, not to mention tons of user frustration.


Bitcoin is already propelling itself into the world consciousness, some sort of pie-in-the-sky event not necessary.


This is completely wrong, and people who think the Facebook v Myspace comparison is a good one are not going to be satisfied whether Bitcoin is 90%+ of the coin market cap (as it is), or 99.99% of the market cap.  No matter how dominant Bitcoin is, you can always say "well something better might come along".
For reasons why this is a stupid concern see:


The return of Satoshi just prompts a new round of scare-based fear-mongering around "Bitcoin's unknown creator" and his potential motives and so on.  It also potentially exposes Satoshi.

Because their entire existence is literally to be in opposition to Bitcoin.
If you ask them, of course they'll say they just want to bring some balance to the discussion, and in a rare moment sometimes one of them does.  
But the plain truth is that 99.9% of all they do is mock and criticize, while constantly moving the goalposts and turning a blind eye to the exponential growth of the most innovative industry on the planet.
If they're too stupid to see what's happening and miss the moon ride, that's their problem.  They could all just leave Bitcoin in peace, and ignore it until the day every one of their friends uses it and they quietly assimilate into the herd.  But given their existence is defined by being antagonistic and argumentative, it's not unreasonable that they either get themselves into prominence here, or Bitcoiners have cause to use them as a very illustrative example.

Transaction propagation is usually not more than 3, and at most 5, seconds in my experience.  It's not that hard to glance and check on a payment screen that propagation has occurred as the cash is exchanged and the ticket is being handed over, and it's not a commercial catastrophe if 1 in 10 000 customers (only the hardcore Bitcoin fans) manages to somehow sneak a single free ticket anyway.

Adjusting to a new system always has its rough transition period, eventually software will take care of it all anyway.
At least with Bitcoin everyone's going to agree to a global standard it seems, and not have issues like with metric/imperial measuring.

It works the other way too, when the price of Bitcoin increases you get more stuff than you bargained for as well.  Most Bitcoiners are invested on the premise that adoption will continue growing at an incredible rate and that this will result in increased demand and increased value over the longer term.
However, that isn't everyone's cup of tea, and this is exactly why NeoBee have a service that allows you to fix your Bitcoin balance to a Euro denominated amount, and let the business receive the cost (or benefit) of exchange rate fluctuations.  It's likely this isn't available to you yet, but such businesses are only going to become more common, so you can look forward to jumping in when one comes to your area if this is a deal breaker for you.

This is why Bitcoin's marketing department is an unstoppable force.  It's better than the marketing department of any company on the planet.
It advertises in every country, in every language, constantly, targeted specifically to its audience, from a trusted source (be it their friend or something they've taken interest in like this stand).
Morever, even Bitcoin's opponents advertise about it.  Of course they spread misinformation, but they can't help increasing Bitcoin's mindshare, legitimacy, brand recognition or perceived robustness every time they open their mouth to criticise it.  And even the critics get some of it right, they're slowly clue-ing in to the blockchain technology, and they usually make a point about the 21 million coin limit, and how Bitcoin's inventor is anonymous.

You have a couple of important issues around the wrong way.


Actually, the people who got in early did the most for Bitcoin, far more than any later adopter, especially if they just bought and held.
They took an enormous risk on a super volatile and unknown asset, providing it the liquidity for trade to emerge and thus increase the network utility, incentivise miners to continue securing the network etc.  Of course the reward should go to those who are in first/earliest, they're the networks strongest reason for success and its staunchest supporters.  
Do you think the last person on earth should have a 'fair share' of Bitcoin set aside for them at everyone else's expense so when they finally get the message and jump on board they don't have to rethink their lack of insight?  I can't imagine a system growing very well where all current users where taxed at the expense of future users, why would anyone want to become a user in the first place?  Everyone would want to be the *last* one to get some Bitcoin, rather than the first, and no one would ever get any Bitcoin.
If people buy and never spend it and die with it, who cares?
If they bought early and have a lot of money now, they are being fairly rewarded for supporting a revolutionary technology that everyone else thinks/thought was stupid, pointless, valueless or never going to survive.  They can only spend into circulation once, and then they have to earn them back at 'market' value.


The distribution of Bitcoin is not equal, but it is not equal in any currency anywhere, nor could it ever be, because the entire point of a currency is to express inequality (aka. who has provided more value to the economy and who hasn't).
However, this is different from the system having universal rules that treat everyone the same.  
In Bitcoin: 
* Everyone can be rewarded by being an early adopter instead of a later adopter 
* Anyone can generate a Bitcoin address and use it to receive funds  
* Anyone can set up a mining pool and start mining for the block reward, which treats every miner identically (everyone uses the same difficulty, the same block reward, is doing the same work for the same proportional chance at the reward, has the same pool of incoming transactions to get fees etc.)
* No one can be prevented from making a transfer to anyone else
* Fees are the same no matter who you are, and there are no transfer limits for anyone
* There is no 'platinum level' Bitcoin subscription required to use 'advanced features' like multisig, it's free to use every aspect of the protocol to its fullest extent
Compare to the US Dollar:
* All future users are currently being taxed to pay for the excess of current users
* A fraction of the planet can open a US dollar denominated bank account
* The US Federal Reserve has a complete monopoly on increasing the supply of US dollars, and anyone else printing them gets a visit from the US government commandos
* Depending on the payment network, it's possible for some parties to block other parties from making or receiving payments.  Ask Russia about their Mastercard subscription.
* Fees can be substantially different, as are transaction limits, often tilted against the poorest users
* For access to 'advanced features' of the US Dollar like loans or faster transfers or whatever probably requires getting an account with more fees or strings attached like a business account
Bitcoin is not distributed equally, nor should it ever be, but it does treat everyone equally.

Exactly, I can't imagine all the people investing in Bitcoin now being very grateful to hear in a couple of years how they were "lucky" and "owe society" for their "undeserved" wealth.  Everyone else could have started mining back then too, we just didn't know about it (tough, sometimes you're not in the right place at the right time), thought it wouldn't last, didn't have the persistence to figure it out or dismissed it for some other reason.  Just like right now anyone can buy some, but of course a lot of people still won't, and will regret it in a couple of years.
People in Bitcoin are rewarded for their foresight and willingness to take a risk, as well as their continued belief despite everyone else telling them they're wrong.
All the early miners deserve every satoshi they have for supporting Bitcoin at such an early stage.

The goal post moving never stops.
- No one accepts Bitcoin!
- No one except Mom and Pop stores accepts Bitcoin!
- No one bigger than Overstock accepts Bitcoin!  Wake me up when Microsoft does zzzZZzz.
- Microsoft accept Bitcoin, but I guarantee they convert 100% to USD, so they're really accepting Bitpay!
- Oh right, 50%+ of Bitpay merchants hodl some Bitcoin, well Microsoft accepts Bitcoin but you can't literally point to their single address on the blockchain!  Nevermind that good wallet management practice involves having a variety of addresses rather than a single one, that this can be managed by the processor on behalf of the merchant and that this in no way precludes them from hodling their own Bitcoin in one or several of their own addresses.
I can't wait for "But **I** don't accept Bitcoin!  It'll never work!"

Yes, that's because they weren't aware of it when it hit $1, $10 or $100.  If it had, they would have called it Tulip Mania then, and then rethought that position when a long time later they heard it had again skyrocketed in price.
It is likely their opinion will be different when it hits $10 000 now, but only because they heard about it at $1000.  People who hear about it for the first time at $10 000 will probably also think it's tulip mania.

0-.  Acquire Bitcoin on Coinbase (I'm not a user, so I don't know how this process goes, but I imagine it's pretty straightforward)
1-.  Have Bitcoin in Coinbase
2-.  Find vendor that accepts Bitcoin
3-.  If vendor is Internet based, select "Pay with Bitcoin".  
3a.  Copy address code displayed on screen.
3b.  Paste address code into Coinbase "Send Bitcoin" function.
3c.  Type in required amount of Bitcoin to send, as displayed on merchant's website.
3d.  Hit send
3e.  (Optional), possibly confirm via an authentication code sent to your mobile for extra security
3f.  Wait for product to be delivered.
3g.   Proceed to step 5.
4-.  If merchant is physically located, download a Bitcoin wallet app on your phone.
4a.  On Android I recommend Mycelium, and on iPhone I guess Blockchain, but I don't have one so ymmv.
4b.  Send a sufficient amount of Bitcoin from your Coinbase account to your phone wallet, using a process almost identical to steps 3a. -&gt; 3e. above.
4c.  Transport yourself to the merchant
4d.  Announce intention to pay via Bitcoin
4e.  Wait to be presented with an iPad, or QR code receipt
4f.   Scan QR code with mobile phone
4g.  Type in amount you owe the merchant
4h.  Hit send
4i.   Wait ~2 seconds for transaction to propagate in network, and merchant to confirm it has been seen.
4j.  Walk away with your item.
5-.  Enjoy being a part of the free economy, as well as your burger/alpaca socks!
5a.  (optional) answer questions from curious onlookers   
Looks like a lot of steps, because I've been as explicit as possible like you requested, but in reality it all happens pretty simply.  It'll be even easier if the merchant is accepting Bitcoin via Coinbase, but you can't bank on that being the case.
Just give it a go, anyone accepting Bitcoin understands that it's new and not everyone is a 2011-era-hardcore expert.
EDIT:  Tried several ways, could not find a way that reddit formatting would let me nest/listify it in a way that made sense, this'll have to do.

Apple was founded in 1976, so arguably it took them 38 years to get 1 million ApplePay users.
Of course the comparison isn't exact, because Bitcoin isn't a company and ApplePay isn't anywhere near as new and different as Bitcoin.  So I agree Bitcoin is taking off slower, but it'll be a bigger deal probably more rapidly than most people expect.

More effective ways of helping Bitcoin succeed:
* Talk to people you know about it
* Give some to people you know
* Hodl, and buy more if you have spare money
The reason activists get rolled frequently by the establishment or large corporations is because they're focussed on things like "awareness" whereas the others go for people who will put their money where their mouth is.  Of course "awareness" and protesting has a better than zero effect, but it's pretty inferior to actually getting more people invested in the Bitcoin system or increasing that investment yourself.

You are confusing the "Your payment is done notification!" with the actual "Payment complete to merchant".
Here's the breakdown:








Turns out the Trezor guys are not doing the sneaky UI trick above where they tell you it's done straight away when when it's not, but they could.
OP please do not reply to this comment, just reread it as many times as necessary until you understand.  It cannot be made any clearer, Bitcoin *can* (but in this case didn't) notify the user the payment is "done" just as fast as Paypal, and *actually* completes in 3 blocks instead of 2 weeks - 2 months like Paypal or credit cards.


No, but plenty of other people have.  And a lot of them are pretty happy after their first Bitcoin experience.  The actual problem/dispute rates might surprise you.

And even for a "man on the street" scenario, there's going to be obvious advantages to tailoring your pitch based on the age, gender, tech familiarity etc. of the recipient, even if only slightly.
Unless you are literally planning to walk around the streets like a religious cultist and try and convert people to Bitcoin, then you must have some more specific information about the demographic that you are hoping to reach with Bitcoin, like your old ladies bridge club.
If you want to stop people on the street, I can't stop you, but I'd recommend starting with your social network or an organisation you are a part of and have some trusted reputation in as a more effective way of educating people about Bitcoin.  You will find it less frustrating, and receive more positive responses.

Maybe worth mentioning that while block rewards will continue until 2140, &gt;99.2% of coins will be released by 2032 (!!), there's a very long tail over the last 100 years or so.


Miners are already being rewarded with small transaction fees.  Instead phrase this to indicate that it is expected that over time increasing transaction volume on the network will allow an increasing aggregate of transaction fees to gradually replace the decreasing block reward as the incentive for miners.

The Big Bang Theory stopped being about legitimate fringe / nerd / geek culture a long long time ago.
In an effort to appeal to a broader audience, more and more female characters were introduced and the amount of references to actual quirky / cool stuff was greatly diminished.  The "nerds" were taken from oddball but likeable characters mostly engaged in their own adventures, to social imbeciles constantly treated like children by their more "savvy" female counterparts as they stumble in and out of romantic relationships.

Everyone also wants to own a full house, but plenty of people get by owning only part of one.


I agree everyone will know bits are a fraction of a bitcoin, but you clearly have not actually introduced new people to Bitcoin with them starting off measuring their Bitcoin wealth in bits, they just accept that as the unit of scale and that's fine.
If they want to own a whole Bitcoin anyway, what's the problem?  Surely that just increases demand for Bitcoin.  There's a lot of things people want that not everyone can have, like a Ferrari or a designer pair of shoes.  
People won't say "Well I can't have a whole Bitcoin, so I'd rather have none!" if they know they can buy a fraction.  Logically they will start accumulating small parts in the hope of getting to a Bitcoin, and if they never make it they'll just add it to the list of thousands of things they want but can't have.

Depends how much the block size is increased (and how fast), and how many people want to get into the block.
The proposal is to increase but not remove the limit in order to limit the former, and bitcoin's growth would predict a continued increase in the latter to compensate.
Of course if the limit is not increased while more and more people want to get into the block, then fees just keep going up until use of the actual Bitcoin network rather than off-chain solutions is unsustainable for smaller amounts, and that's not great either.

The concept is very simple:
Secure messaging app using crypto.  This is great, but already exists.  It's called Bitmessage.
Add Bitcoin payments.  This is also great.  Noone has any issues with this.
Add some Counterparty token called "Gems".  Bitcoin is already enabled, and can probably do everything these "gems" are supposed to (like reward users).  Despite this, the Gems have been added anyway to have some flash marketing and get rich quick promises that are bound to implode.
No-one can explain why the Gems are not just another doomed app coin as outlined here:
The response so far basically comes down to:
1.  But *Counterparty!!*, therefore Bitcoin *IS* involved. (so why do you need Gems then?)
2.  It's like a company stock.  (Ok, well Gems the app or currency has no commercially profitable history, no userbase and no proven demand for their service.  If this was a stock, it would be the worst investment ever.  No-one would ever buy it because it's all promises built on expected return, before any real world evidence of success is presented.  In other words, a scam.)  
3.  This is so innovative that you're too stupid to understand. (clearly) 
Edit:  If Gems were distributed in one fixed amount, backed by Bitcoin's provably owned by the holding company and utilised entirely to access some extra feature in the app that is only available through the use of Counterparty, I would understand where they came in.  But I'd also be making sure every single user understood the value was reliant on the central party not running off with the Bitcoin, which they do every single time.
However, this argument has yet to be made, probably because people in Bitcoin are already attuned to the "well we hold your Bitcoin for you" as being a huge red flag.

Well, in Bitcoin, noone (especially not a self-interested person) is in control of the money directly, and very obliquely *everyone* is in control of the money.  So that's fixed.


Bitcoin is the Gold standard 2.0.  It protects property rights, but is also much harder to suppress via physical force.  To date Bitcoin has had very little trouble from direct government attack, for some good thoughts why see [this article](  Next.


Yes, and this is why Bitcoin supporters are such fanatics, because they understand that this war is being fought right now.


Yes, this is most people pre-Bitcoin (including me).  The difference now is that Bitcoin is useful enough to convert people who understand neither system (no need for an ideological conversion), and as a bonus free them from the old system behind the scenes.


Yet again, yes, Bitcoin fixes this.


With Bitcoin, there may be no government.  Or in the words of Jeff Berwick, 7 billion governments.

No, it's not that easy.
It's actually submit a transaction on one part of the network.  Within the next couple of seconds, submit a transaction to another part of the network, hope and pray that it is picked up by a node that doesn't already have the first transaction and that the second transaction propagates around faster than the first one or is mined by a miner that also doesn't have the first transaction, despite the latter having a head start.
I believe nodes stick with the first valid transaction they see, and not replace it with a second transaction even if the fee is higher.  So doublespending is not some leisurely stroll to submit a double-spend with a marginally higher fee before the first block confirmation.

Perhaps Satoshi both conceptualised and built a revolutionary working piece of software, which includes the mining, node, wallet and loads of customisation pieces all in one box as a one-man job.  
He then kickstarted a community that now numbers in the millions.  
Throughout all of this he left so little information behind that even in this day and NSAge no-one has really been able to track him down and publicly out him, despite the enormous incentives to do so.
Can't blame him if something as minor as smoothing out the distribution curve wasn't high on his priority list.
Bitcoin might not be perfect, but by anyone's standards there's no real competition for  crypto so he definitely did well enough.

Several people can share an address.  For instance a lot of people have their Bitcoin in Coinbase, which isn't optimal of course but it's the way it is, and Coinbase aggregates the majority of their funds into several cold storage addresses.  Many exchanges and larger providers do the same thing.

A lot of people say it's unlikely that coins &gt; say 4 years with no movement still have the access keys around, as you think people would at least move them once to a more secure spot.  Security practices and Bitcoin's value has moved enormously in that time.
But then again someone recently was moving early block rewards from 2009 that had never been touched before.  So yes, we really really don't know.
It's got to be quite a few though, I'd think at least a million (not counting Satoshi's possible million).  Very early adopters have made posts about how back in the day people used to send 10 000 Bitcoins to a random address just to see if it would work.
@_date: 2014-12-27 03:34:06
Doesn't matter, saw the Bitcoin logo, heard the word Bitcoin, probably via a medium (TV commercial) that they hadn't associated with Bitcoin before.
Combine this with a friend mentioning it, seeing a shop accepting it, maybe an online web article about it, and *that's* when people think "I really should figure out this Bitcoin thing".
That's the seed being planted, the seed of human curiosity and nervousness about being in the outgroup by the time everyone else has joined the ingroup (in this case, knowing about - and eventually owning- Bitcoin).

Seems unlikely, as the network needs just a single path in to keep all the Russian nodes up to date, provided that Russia doesn't have a majority or even sizeable minority of the hashing power.

IANABitcoin technical expert but:
Blocks are slow cos you have to say "Here's the block nonce I used, and here's every transaction that goes into it!"
But the miners already have most of the transactions due to just general network broadcasting.  So instead you can say "Here's the block nonce I used, and a quick, pretty accurate summary of all the transactions in it (instead of the complete, comprehensive transaction set)".  The summary is enough for miners to get started on the next block, and they can verify it was legit retrospectively once the small details filter in.
This allows much larger blocks to be profitably mined (since there's no propagation delay) than currently.

Yes, because miners and nodes are easily going to come to come to consensus on a change that devalues every one of their holdings and benefits at most a tiny minority of them (if the code was changed to pay out to a small subset).
Even if that happened (which it never, ever will), all of the holders would immediately pull their funds / continue on a new network with the old rules and a smaller mining network (all the liquidity drains out of new Bitcoin, and moved into classic Bitcoin), and the smart miners would switch back, which then snowballs to all the miners switching back.

- Bitcoin hash rate and daily transaction volumes rocket upwards at an incredible rate
- Bitcoin ATM numbers explode from ~10 to 300+
- subscribers increase 2-4x
- Multiple governments have enquiries into crypto currencies, with Andreas a top speaker
- The alt coin bubble crashes, Bitcoin makes big gains against Litecoin, Dogecoin etc.
- Large/well recognized VC firms like Andreesen Horowitz start showing support for Bitcoin
- Bitcoin continues to spread among new user bases through the launch of changetip, with events like the and on Reddit
- Overstock starts accepting Bitcoin
- Dell starts accepting Bitcoin
- Paypal makes noise about Bitcoin, adds some minor features
- Microsoft accepts Bitcoin
Obviously also noteworthy on the other side of the coin:
- Mt Gox's implosion, and the subsequent aftermath
- Regulatory shambles of the BitLicense in NY
- Ongoing drama with China/Russia about the legality of Bitcoin
- Blockchain.info hacks
- MintPal pulling a Neo+Bee
- Wall st, Winklevoss ETF etc. stalls out amidst regulations
- Ghash gets to 51% of the hashing power, relatively rapidly reduced back to 20% as it is replaced by Chinese mining farm Discus Fish
- Ethereum presales for 15+ million, still has no product

Exactly.  Bitcoin does have a massive marketing campaign.
Or have you missed the hundreds of videos posted here from CNBC, various news blog articles, "I just talked with so and so about Bitcoin!!" and on and on and on.
People with a commercial stake in Bitcoin and/or casual supporters of Bitcoin are doing a lot to correct the public's opinion of Bitcoin.  It's a massive task though, and it's fighting against active attempts by the mainstream and the banks to keep it down.
Bitcoin isn't marketed like Coke is by Coca Cola, but like how the Internet was by people that were interested in it and eventually companies that could profit off it.
That's all it needs.
If you're going to contribute by organising some marketing how you think it should be done, best of luck, but the fact that we are here and things are happening is a lot of evidence that Bitcoin already does have a lot of marketing going for it.  It's just not marketing in the way you expect.

The entire point of a side chain is that getting some coins on one requires freezing an equivalent amount on the main chain.
Getting those main chain coins back requires destroying the coins on the side chain.
So, while it's possible to have increasing numbers of coins on a side chain, doing so just decreases the proportion of frozen main chain coins they can unlock.
Main chain, freeze 1 BTC, unlock 10 SidechainCoin.
Side chain, freeze/destroy 1 SidechainCoin, unlock 0.1 BTC.
That's the idea.

While this might be technically feasible, it's guaranteed to fail in the long run.
Yes, people are worried about volatility, because they don't like losing money.  But that's not the main reason people don't use Bitcoin, lack of understanding of the system is a far larger problem.
Bitcoin you lose purchasing power sometimes in the short term.  USD you always lose purchasing power in the long term.
If the US gov makes FEDcoin which is pegged to the USD, then teaches everyone about crypto, what's the first question people are going to ask?
"Why isn't this like Bitcoin?"
The answers will include:
* It's backed by government guns, yay!
* You can trust us, right?
* We will force merchants to accept it, and not outlaw it
* It's not volatile
* The supply is not limited
Everyone will start out very satisfied by the first 3 reasons, but over time start to wonder about the volatility thing (as Bitcoin will continue to trend up against a FEDcoin over the long run) and gradually hit on the last point and then realise they've got the short end of the stick.
And when I say "everyone", I mean American citizens in America, who could maybe be convinced/forced to use FEDcoin.  Everywhere else in the world, having US gov support is neutral at best (worst) and a strong disincentive at worst (best).

a)  Yes.  You yourself are a decentralised exchange point for fiat &lt;-&gt; BTC.  If she does her Bitcoin commerce through you rather than one of the larger points of failure (even if you subsequently rely on them), that's not such a bad thing.  That's also why Mycelium Local Trader and Localbitcoins are great, and why it's almost impossible for governments to stop the spread in any single country (even if they can shut down exchanges).
b)  Not a problem with BTC, a problem with you.  You should have just said 'Mom download this app, hand me the $50, let me scan that, there you go.'  Don't put obstacles in her way, make it as easy as possible and let her figure out more of the system once she can already see some of the benefits.
c) See a. and b. above.
Of course it would be great if everyone had the world's best Bitcoin service available to them, but really YOU are the world's best Bitcoin &lt;-&gt; fiat service for other people who know you, so take advantage of that.

Hodling is the thing the entire Bitcoin economy is built on.  It increases liquidity / demand, provides the ability to use Bitcoin at all (it's much better for 99% of people to be hodlers than 99% to be spenders.  At the extremes, most hodlers will be happy to spend if the price continues rising but most spenders would not become hodlers if the price keeps dropping), and since Bitcoin's are divisible and can be moved every 10 minutes their velocity is insanely high and the economy only needs a tiny, tiny fraction of Bitcoin to be bought/sold at any one time to continue doing extremely well.

The Mycelium switch by default to bits has made a huge impact on people that I introduce to Bitcoin, seeing "10 000 bits" pop up avoids a whole "what the heck so I've only got 0.000 something Bitcoins??!?" and gives the idea immediately that it can be used for small transactions.

... which could always be done better in Bitcoin, as anyone whose app requires use of their app coin will discover they get a flood of user complains saying "Can't we just use Bitcoin instead?" and/or will lose market share to a competitor that does integrate Bitcoin.
Counterparty is not an app coin, it's a Bitcoin extension.  I think Counterparty is great, and app coins terrible.  App coins have their own network of miners and blockchain, plus some link to an "app".  Counterparty is not an "exception" to app coins being terrible, it's just not an app coin.

I don't think a world where everyone transacts everything in Bitcoin is that close on the horizon, although it's definitely a long term possibility.  However, a world where some people can transact everything is already barely possible (see: Blockchain.info's lack of a bank account) and is becoming simple to do at an astonishing rate.
I'm glad there's Bitcoin skeptics, of course Bitcoin has issues and isn't the one true way, but it really seems like critics do nothing but shift the goalposts every time Bitcoin takes a step forward.
* Bitcoin's a good idea in theory, but show me a running network and we'll talk
* Bitcoin's only use is drugs
* Bitcoin's only used by fringe hardcore supporters
* Bitcoin's only used by also-ran online retailers, who convert it all to $ anyway
* Bitcoin's only used by also ran online retailers, who convert 90% of it to $ anyway
* ...
* Can't wait for Bitcoin's only used by Ebay, Amazon doesn't even accept it.
Funnily enough, same thing happens with price movement:
* Bitcoin will never be more than $1
* Bitcoin will never be more than $10
* Bitcoin will never be more than $100
* Bitcoin will never be more than $1000
* Let me guess, Bitcoin will never be more than $10 000?  
Silk Road going down didn't stop adoption, and Mt Gox isn't appearing to either.
I guess some people will just never be convinced, until the day when Bitcoin usage is just everyday practice among their friends and they quietly follow the crowd and hope no-one remembers they were the last one still saying it would never work.

Having one or only a couple of large pools is not great, and you're right should be avoided, but it's not catastrophic.
One pool at greater than 50% is a whole other beast though, because it makes Bitcoin **guaranteed** to be manipulatable, rather than **probabalistically** manipulatable.  When one party has an ability to alter (ie. double spend, prevent transactions not desired by the party in control, or prevent others mining blocks etc.) the network that tends towards 100% as time increases, there's not only a good chance they will but also that noone else can do much about it.

Totally disagree.
Bitcoin adoption is happening exponentially because it does (almost) nothing but cause controversy and make headlines.  Bitcoin's worst enemy is ignorance, not misinformation.  Someone who has heard about Bitcoin several times is much more likely to be interested in discussing it than someone hearing about it for the first time, even if it was originally all in a negative light.
Criminals use stuff because it is useful, and so does everyone else, they just don't adopt as quickly because they're not playing the same high-risk, high-reward game as the criminals.  Grandma didn't care that drug cartels were the first adopters of the mobile phone, and she won't care with Bitcoin.  She just needs it to be easy, and that's only happening because it's a tool for EVERYONE.

Exactly.  This is probably the strongest evidence possible that Bitcoin is revolutionary.  When someone is uncomfortable about something that requires nothing of them, is entirely voluntary to participate in, and cannot possibly hurt them if they don't get involved, the only explanation is that it's a challenge to their mental model and they're not ready to handle it yet.
Bitcoin has been growing exponentially, both despite and because of making a lot of people feel uncomfortable.  That's a really, really good thing and not something to shy away from.
These two articles will explain why everything else you said could use some rethinking.
Drugs, guns, porn and anarchy is why Bitcoin has succeeded in the past, and is why it will continue to succeed in the future.  As Daniel puts it...

Are you really that naive?
* Operating an international business is not a walk in the park, even when you're just doing something simple like shipping bottles of paint
* Add to this, regulation compliance for financial services in multiple jurisdictions (simultaneously, and unavoidable as that's the nature of remittances)
* Very high burden in terms of operating a Bitcoin business, hard to interact with legacy financial system, high need to train specialised staff etc.
* Very low liquidity in the Bitcoin network generally
* Very small pool of Bitcoin adopters in even the most tech forward countries, and the best remittance targets are usually the least tech forward, compounding the problem
* Security and usability problems with Bitcoin due to tech/ecosystem immaturity
* Security problems with running a financial/cash distribution service in any country, let alone several simultaneously
* Weak/nonexistent network effect of smaller companies against established competitors like Western Union

Bitcoin is by default part of a survival of the fittest race because altcoins (actual altcoins, like Ethereum and Litecoin - NOT Bitcoin Unlimited) exist.  If Bitcoin doesn't keep pushing itself, eventually it will lose out to a competitor.  It shouldn't be taking any major risks (as they can be done in altcoins first to test them out), but it also shouldn't be ever be totally stalling (as it is now).  At some point, the risk of inaction is much much higher than the risk of action.

You've already covered it somewhat with the ideas about Bitcoin always having someone who needs it and will adopt, but some kind of article on how critics of Bitcoin seem to always miss the mark by an enormous margin.
All of the most knowledgeable criticism of Bitcoin comes from people who think Bitcoin is great, like the core devs.  Most other criticism is from either ignorance, or an ego investment in the existing 'accepted' paradigm (eg. some economists).
Buttcoiners et al. cherry pick their criticism and then constantly move the goalposts in an effort to self-delude themselves into believing it's not working.
The "Bitcoin **won't work**!" claim is pretty ridiculous, given it already is working, and has been for five years.
The "Bitcoin's community will make it fail!" you've already somewhat addressed, but maybe some more expansion on how radical, evangelical and unrelenting it is is fantastic because it might actually mean after we're all rich we might make a difference.  Perhaps something about who existing Bitcoin-wealthy are already starting to spend their wealth to finance projects that support their ideology, eg. Olivier Janssens spending a bunch on the bounty for a decentralised Bitcoin Foundation replacement.
A lot of "but why should IIIIII use Bitcoin?" type complaints are heard by people in the top 1% of global wealth who can't fathom a world beyond their FDIC insured credit card.
In the end the critics will bow silently to peer pressure or societal expectation, when everyone else around them has just stopped listening and jumped on board.

There's no statute of limitations on how many attempts we can have.  That's the point, each version is getting a little bit more support than the last.
As long as the censorship stays in place, transaction fees keep rising and the network gets more congested - alternatives will continue to gain traction.
This process continues until either Core decides to actually compromise, or an alternative hits critical mass and gains control.  I don't even mind if none of the alternatives never win out, because if they don't that means that Core has finally come to its senses.  But it's nice to know that if they don't (and it seems they won't, they've already had plenty of opportunity) that eventually things will change.

What you described sounds exactly like localbitcoins.
If what you mean is not local bitcoins, then how the fuck does this work: 




There's two really obvious problems:
1.  Emailing is too slow.  Apparently you don't know how real-time price updates work, but you're not going to get anything even approaching useful or accurate if the whole thing operates based on thousands of people eventually checking their email, which could take days or even never.
2.  People can just ignore the email.  If I get an email saying "You bought 1 Bitcoin from Johnny for $1 000" but the price is now $950 on some other exchange, I simply ignore the email and don't trade with Johnny.


You're right, you don't need to trust the exchange any more. Instead you need to trust some anonymous email to hold up their end of the bargain. That's an even worse idea, at least the exchange has a transparent business model and a reputation they need to maintain.
TL:DR; Either you're describing localbitcoins or the weirdest, slowest and world's most totally useless "exchange".  Please set up this exchange, I'll buy a ton of Bitcoin from you on it. You send first, I promise I'll send some money back eventually when I check my burner email.
Edit: Google "Bitsquare".  That's the trustless exchange you want but it uses multisig and Bitcoin escrows instead of pointless emails and actually works. Go help their project.

You asked me to reason by analogy by asking about why this doesn't apply to fiat currency.  I did, to try and help you understand.  As an ANALOGY, it's not perfect, it's just intended to convey one specific thing.  You're now pretending you didn't ask for an analogy, to falsely portray me as stating that fiat and Bitcoin are the same, which I didn't.  The similarity I am expressing is that most of the time one group of people runs the currency (miners/government) unless there is a massive crisis in which case everyone else does (hodlers/citizens). That's as far as the similarity goes.  Don't ask for an analogy or comparison if you're going to be hyperbolic when I give you a response.


Yes, but those technologies also become politicised.  Who controlled the early printing presses was a big deal, same with who controlled the world ports and ability to ship stuff to different countries. 
I've got to be honest, you sound like a massive neckbeard that doesn't understand Bitcoin is a human system and you think you can get it all perfectly squared away by yourself in your room with your computer and your calculator. That's the exact opposite of how Bitcoin is, the computer system is just the backdrop to all the thousands of users meeting and interacting and participating in commerce using Bitcoin in the real world.
Go to a Bitcoin meetup or something and meet some other Bitcoiners. Maybe it will help you understand that Bitcoin is valuable as a social and economic tool for REAL PEOPLE, it's not some abstract mathematical idea floating around in cyberspace that we can get all the numbers perfectly lined up for and it will all be ok, no matter how much your nerdy OCD instincts want that to be true.

Bitcoin is a business. It provides a service (a global currency network) to customers (users) at a price (transaction fees).
If a better business (an altcoin) comes along, then Bitcoin will gradually lose customers to its competitor and its share price (exchange rate to USD) will drop, until eventually it hits $0 and is bankrupt.
I don't want Bitcoin to bend to my or anyone else's "will". What I want is for it to be responsive to the needs of its users. What a shocking idea.
I can't believe the amount of isolationist people with hardline "If you don't like it my way, go somewhere else" attitudes in Bitcoin.  While that is appropriate in some circumstances (mostly: people who don't own or aren't interested in Bitcoin yet), telling everyone to leave if they don't like what you're saying is great until you're standing in an empty room with no audience.

I agree.  A combination of raising the block size limit (hopefully sooner rather than later, at least a bit), increases in computer hardware, and development of new technology will make broader adoption more feasible.
However, this will all take time. Although in my opinion, we should be trying to get a block size increase as fast as possible, to give more breathing room for the other options to kick in.

Core: Increasing block size past 1MB will create too much pressure on full nodes in countries with shitty internet. Everyone should be able to run a node, even if it comes at the cost of super expensive and delayed transactions for the rest of the users.  A higher degree of decentralisation is worth killing off tons of existing users and existing services.  For some reason, SegWit is a good idea because it "increases" blocksize but somehow isn't a problem for nodes - I still don't understand the contradiction here.
Unlimited: Letting miners set blocksize will allow an immediate increase in blocksize to 2MB.  This will lower fees and confirmation delays and produce some breathing room for the Bitcoin community to keep growing while further scaling solutions are developed.  Maybe there will be some small loss of nodes run in crappy countries, but returning Bitcoin to a useable network (reasonable fees, low confirmation times) and encouraging user growth is much, much more important as ultimately more users means more people to run nodes.


It means Bitcoin splits into two versions.  The one with more community/miner/node support will likely rapidly come to dominate and be the "new" Bitcoin.  The old Bitcoin will have massive confirmation delays due to a drop in hash rate and probably die off entirely as its price crashes.  Holders get coins on both sides of the fork, so they can just wait and see what happens, or if they are feeling sure they know which side will win they can sell on one side and buy on the other to increase their holdings either ending up with extra coins or none depending on if they correctly predicted which side would win.


No one knows.  Depends on if a fork happens, how drawn out it is and how much confusion it creates in the community.  Short term, probably yes there will be a price drop of some kind.  Afterwards, nobody knows. In MY opinion, Bitcoin Unlimited is likely to win and that will encourage a big price rally as Bitcoin returns to a network able to onboard new users with lower fees and the market sees that it can handle a hard fork to upgrade when necessary.


If you hold your coins, you will still have those no matter which side wins.
Otherwise, I've given about the best summary I can.  I'm sure if you have further questions someone will answer them in the comments.

That doesn't create a meaningful dialogue, it just ostracises people until they find someone else who they can actually have a non-judgemental conversation with.

Actually, you don't know that at all.  In economics, there's always the tradeoff of what we achieved versus the unseen cost of the missed opportunities that we could have had if we'd done something different.
It is very possible, I would say incredibly likely, that if Bitcoin had successfully implemented a scaling solution its price would be much higher than it is now and/or increasing at a faster rate.
Just because the price is going up doesn't mean everything's perfect because it could easily be going up a lot more if things were better.

That post referenced [this post]( from three months earlier than that, on basic troll techniques.
If we have a brief look at the history of and we discover that both have posted vitriol and negativity in in the last week. 
This means in more than **5 months** (actually much longer, but for the sake of this post we're only tracking from my initial observation) they haven't found something else more constructive to occupy their precious seconds on this planet.

A brief explanation of this phenomenon, appended maybe with a tag saying that Buttcoin started when Bitcoin was $4 (and guaranteed to fail by the end of 2011 iirc) would be all that's required to let intelligent readers make up their own mind.
For me, Buttcoin is perhaps the biggest indicator of Bitcoin's success. Something that doesn't work or isn't challenging assumptions has zero detractors. As long as there are Buttcoiners whining away, the answer to "Is Bitcoin continuing to work and improve?" will remain a resounding "Yes".

Enlighten me.
My understanding is people hodling coins get paid from the transaction fees in proportion to how much of the coin supply they own.
Maybe this is more energy efficient, and maybe even incentives nodes (although I imagine some clever soul will figure out how to do an SPV client that still gets coin hodling payouts), but it sure as shit will lead to an intrinsic and ever widening wealth imbalance and is questionable in terms of ability to secure the network.
You might rightly say that Bitcoin's current wealth distribution is not particularly "fair", and that's true, but the early adopters can only spend their "cheap" coins once, and getting more requires supporting the network by expensive mining, not just sit on them for a constant supply of new ones, of which they can just spend a part and still grow their principle.

Some of the developers and some users want SegWit.  They're complaining that there's no reason not to, while at the same time stridently protesting against or preventing a non-catastrophic and very reasonable block size increase - which has just as little reason to oppose.

In theory, any kind of change is possible to the Bitcoin protocol.  It's just code.  See: almost every single alt coin, which is basically Bitcoin with some changes made.  Eg. a different coin limit and block time (Litecoin), mining reward scheme (Dogecoin), extra features (Darkcoin) and so on
The rub is in getting *consensus* and *implementation* on those changes.
This requires most significantly a majority of the mining hash rate to support a change before it will be implemented.  On a more general level, it also requires the support of nodes and users, as if they don't upgrade the effect also won't take place, but the miners are probably the most critical.
In the case of things like changing the Bitcoin hashing algorithm or the maximum amount of Bitcoins, there will never ever be consensus to do so, because it directly contradicts the interests of all the developers, nodes, miners and users of Bitcoin.
What do you mean by the "length" of a block?  I'm going to assume you mean the block interval (estimated time between blocks), there isn't really a reason to change that.  There's lots of other discussions about confirmations and instant transaction times, but the TL:DR; is lower block times are less secure and make the network unstable.
Miners fees: Miners can charge whatever they want, and accept or reject any transactions based on their fee I believe.  Each miner can decide for themselves what's worth it to them to include in their blocks.  The market then decides a fair price, as there are a multitude of mining pools.  Note that the fees miners choose to accept is different to the default or recommended fee by a Bitcoin client, which Gavin is working on changing from 0.1 mBTC to a floating market rate at the moment in Bitcoin core.
More generally, as I understand it, there are three categories of changes.
**Minor easy ones**
 
* Example: lowering the base fee.  
* Implementation: Simple and routine, happens regularly.
**Soft fork required**
* "A softfork is a change to the bitcoin protocol wherein only previously valid blocks/transactions are made invalid. Since old nodes will recognise the new blocks as valid, a softfork is backward-compatible. This kind of fork requires only a majority of the miners upgrading to enforce the new rules."  
* Implementation:  somewhat difficult. Apparently side chains might be implementable with a soft fork.  
* EDIT: multisig was a soft fork.
* 
**Hard fork required**
* "A hardfork is a change to the bitcoin protocol that makes previously invalid blocks/transactions valid, and therefore requires all users to upgrade."  
* Implementation:  controversial, difficult and risky.  Has only happened perhaps a couple of times in Bitcoin's history.  (??)
* Edit:  Example: Zerocoin or another anonymity enhancements.
*

Well once we perfect alchemy, gold will not be either.
Of course you're technically correct that someone *could* fork Bitcoin, and it *could* be adopted, and the world *could* be full of pink invisible unicorns (that's a fact whether you like it or not), but it's never going to happen. Implying that gold is somehow a significantly superior option because of an imaginary change to Bitcoin that would never be adopted is either idiotic or trolling.

Decentralization does make things more secure.  It also makes mistakes more unforgiving.
The reason your Bitcoin balance is more secure than your bank account is because there *isn't* anyone you can call if you forget your password (slash private keys).  Just that someone else can find out your password, because it's stored somewhere, is the decrease in security.
Of course this does make it less forgiving.  But it's a direct trade for security, not some unfortunate but possibly avoidable consequence.

Like I've already pointed out, the majority of the other 100 have invested nowhere near as much time or energy into Bitcoin, so their emotional feelings about it are of course going to be much less significant.  Also, you're arguing from selection bias - that everyone who likes the Core way of doing things is still there is evidence that it's a great way to do things, when there is plenty of people that don't like the Core way of doing things who never signed up to start with and so never left.  Saying "people who left is small, therefore the idea is still good" is only coming from a sample size of "people who signed up and thought it was a good idea to start with".
If someone commits one tiny change to Core, and never submits anything again, they have effectively "rage quit" but you wouldn't categorise it that way because they weren't ever even significant enough to get noticed when they left.  You would still count them as part of your totally unrealistic and misleading "100 developers in Core" statistic.  I could probably find at least 10 examples of this exact situation right now.


Ok so my numbers were slightly off but it's still basically insignificant amounts on the scale of thousands of nodes.  I absolutely support them, best of luck to them, but saying "See, we have heaps of decentralisation!" based on those numbers alone is ludicrous.


You say that like it's a problem, when that's exactly what you want.  As more and more development teams emerge, they will all start copying code from each other in a cross-pollinating environment where the best emerges from competition.  Maybe the majority of the code will continue to come from Core, who knows, that wouldn't be a problem at all. The important thing is that the capability for alternatives to naturally emerge exists in the first place.

In a decentralized system, the definition of the "real" system is the one with the longest chain of proof of work. Which was the "original" Bitcoin is totally irrelevant once its proof of work chain gets decisively shorter.
By your logic, if I had been running a miner on Bitcoin 0.1 since 2009 and never upgraded it, I still have the "real" Bitcoin and everyone else is on an altcoin.  This is patently ridiculous and false.

To start with: Gavin Andresen, Jeff Garzik, Mike Hearn
All of them have been forced out of Core, and between them have an almost unmatched amount of Bitcoin knowledge plus a very valuable alternative perspective to what has now become an echo chamber in the development team.
Edit: So now "Consensus" has gone from "everyone agrees" to "most people agree".  And yet according to Core developers, a majority hash rate DOESN'T make "consensus" - since EVERYONE is needed for "consensus" and nothing can be discussed (or implemented in Bitcoin) unless EVERYONE agrees with it.  A hard fork without everyone is too dangerous because it "doesn't have consensus", yet if a judiciously selected group of developers mostly agree with something that IS "consensus".
The ability to redefine terms at will and constantly play both sides of the fence with a straight face is absolutely unmatched in any other community I have ever been a part of.

Yes, $10 is too expensive for me for just random transactions.  If it's not too expensive for you then you must either have terrible financial management or shit on a golden toilet.  It's too expensive to justify the cost for 99% of the things I buy. I'd pay a $10 fee on a $1000 purchase, but I don't buy many things that cost that much. Neither does 99% of the people on this planet 99% of the time.  If Bitcoin is only used by 1% of the people 1% of the time then congratulations you have the existing banking cartel upgraded to the latest technology.
Who is going to pay $10 to donate $10 to Wikileaks?  What's their average donation size, I bet it's well under $100 and at a 10%+ fee no one is going to bother.
I can't believe you're this naive.  Yes, I agree that preserving Bitcoin's decentralisation and irreversibility of transactions is a good thing and worth protecting. But we can afford to give a little lee way on the decentralisation to avoid becoming the world's most expensive, cumbersome and least used payment system.
Your attitude is the equivalent of the person who tries to protect themselves from disease by locking themselves in a sterlized box.  Yes, that will keep you from getting a disease but now you're stuck in the box and functionally useless to the rest of the world (as well as having a really shit life).  A better strategy is to maintain good hygiene, get your vaccine shots and keep your living conditions generally clean - which mitigates 99% of the risk and expands your living capability by 100 fold over the isolationist box.
It's a trade off, and the extreme end of protectionism is never the right answer. That should be very obvious in a technology that is designed to thrive on open competition with a libertarian community, but apparently it isn't.
I've had enough arguing with you, our views of Bitcoin are just incompatible.  We'll let the market/miners sort it out.  For both our sakes, I really hope you don't get your wish and $10 Bitcoin transactions are the norm, but it's ok because if it does I'll switch to a currency that actually works in the real world.

No chance, Bitcoin's community is what has got it to where it is.  Sure, it can be extreme and controversial, but Bitcoin wouldn't be so revolutionary if it didn't attract (and then make rich) people with strong enough opinions that they might actually make a difference in society.

Are you "all the devs"?  How can you speak on their behalf?  Not only do I think this is unlikely, it would be height of hypocrisy for those who were so critical of Mike Hearn leaving when Bitcoin didn't go the way he wanted to do the exact same.


If you side with the forkers, then you know that Bitcoin retains the ability to fork and fulfil the needs of its users. In case you didn't know, in the case of a hard fork holders never lose because you get coins on both forks, so I'm much more interested in Bitcoin being able to adapt via forks than I am in being on the "winning" side of any forks.  If Bitcoin can adapt, I ALWAYS win in the long run because Bitcoin gets better over time.  If it doesn't, I always lose since eventually another altcoin kills it off.

It's not the benevolent developers that spend time looking through the code, it's the malicious ones.
And they have huge incentive to do so, because finding a bug can possibly mean making millions (especially with Bitcoin), whether by stealing a bunch of other people's coins through some exploit or taking out a huge leverage position and then breaking news of the vulnerability.
If there was a Bitcoin vulnerability, we'd know, because people's Bitcoin would be disappearing.  That it doesn't means it must be secure.
If the blueprint is published freely and yet the coins are still in the safe, you know it's secure.  If the blueprint is a trade secret, then you're really only as safe as the security of that blueprint, and there's no guarantee someone won't figure out an exploit without it.
That's the difference between Bitcoin's security model, and a bank's.

How do you know what the miners do?
Maybe they hold on to some or all of their Bitcoin instead of selling it.
Maybe they have fiat funding, or subsidised electricity or volunteers working for free/below market rates to be part of the Bitcoin economy.
Stop making blatantly overreaching assumptions.


Bitcoin is a miners-control-everything system (excepting edge cases where a huge majority of the userbase coordinates against them), that IS the point of investing in it. The revolution of cryptocurrency is having miners with economic incentives run a currency instead of a government with political incentives.
If it REALLY comes down to it, the miners do serve the users (because there's no point mining a coin with no hodlers) but in almost all cases it doesn't come to that and the miners are the gatekeepers to what features get implemented.

I'm not inventing anything, just explaining a system that already exists and which Bitcoin will use - have software development of Bitcoin software occur across a variety of development projects. Let nodes and miners run whichever client they want and Bitcoin the final blockchain turns out as whatever changes get majority support across the spread of clients/nodes/miners.  We're starting to see this happen right now, which is very encouraging but the blind "Bitcoin Core is the ONE TRUE PATH - anyone who wants a variety of implementations is a heretic that is killing Bitcoin" devotees aren't helping.
See [this graph]( for an idea of how this is starting to happen.

For a lot of the lower ranked employees, at least part of the motivation is a feeling that they are doing good.  However, as I said, this motivation isn't strong enough to outweigh personal considerations once the ride gets a bit bumpy.

Depends what the bug is.
It might only happen on certain operating systems, in a certain version of the client (there's a wide variety running), under certain localised network conditions, with a certain combination of mempool transactions etc. etc.
That's the whole point of a decentralized system.  It's extremely unlikely all 5 000 nodes are going to suffer the exact same bug at the exact same moment.
This is also a reason to encourage the adoption of alternative clients and a diversity of development teams.

No, the rising transaction volume means it's getting more useful period, so long as less than 100% of the increase in transactions are spam.

Tfw big blockers asked for Segwit + 2mb blocks months or years ago, as about the fourth stage of compromise where big blocks shifted their position and Core changed nothing.
There has never been a single shred of compromise on Core's side (except a lot of "but SegWit IS a block size increase" misdirection, sidestepping actually agreeing to raise the block size). This created the divide that exists now, because there is 0 desire to put up with any more lies about one-sided "compromise".

Total nodes running all of these clients live on the network: Less than 10 as far as I'm aware.

There is (theoretically) no limit on the divisibility of Bitcoin (at the moment the current code counts in pieces of 100 000 000), but that doesn't make the supply infinite.
Imagine you have one pizza, worth $16.  You cut it into 8 pieces.  It is now divided, each piece is now worth $2, but you haven't created any extra pizza and the sum value of all the pizza is still $16.  This applies no matter how small you cut the pizza.

Once past the first block post switch, hash power has to be allocated to one chain or the other, you can't mine two forks of Bitcoin with the same hardware afaik.
You can split them 50/50 maybe, but you can't get 100% of your hash power mining both chains at once.
Miners would rather not "play safe", since mining 50/50 will almost certainly lose them money. This forces a decision and a fairly rapid snowball to one or the other rather quickly.
@_date: 2017-02-09 05:16:18
Time will tell.
My money is on a gradually growing amount of hash rate mining Unlimited (or some other blocksize increase alternative), until it successfully forks and sets a new block size on the network.  Exchanges, almost all users, node operators and basically everyone outside the hardcore "Consensus is defined as agreeing with me" crowd will happily switch over.  Bitcoin's price will start a renewed bull run because both the capacity for new users will be there and the market will see that hard forks really aren't the end of the world when necessary.  You and lukeJR will either quietly stay a part of the network with your tail between your legs, or rage at how stupid everyone is as Bitcoin moves on and leaves you and your worthless 1MB capped network behind.
Alternatively, Core finally hits crisis mode as the reality of the situation hits them and they pull out a last minute "Ok we'll raise the blocksize" to avoid losing control.
What WON'T happen is that Core stays in control but does nothing about the blocksize and we all twiddle our thumbs as rising fees and transaction backlogs kills the usability of Bitcoin.
RemindMe! 18 months "How accurate was my prediction?  Did decide to go for ashamedly trailing along the new network, or raging that he is still right and the market/community/miners/whoever is still stupid?"

For Bitcoin to beat Paypal, it can't just be "a little bit" better. It has to be A LOT better.

I'll take these terms modified as such.  The banning discussion part was mostly Theymos, who isn't actually a developer as far as I know so I'll admit that it was an oversight to lump him in with them. Also the whole squabble is over "consensus" so that definitely needs to be included in the terms.
But if we take out the discussion part and focus only on code requiring "consensus" being implemented on the network, then I think I can find at least one example of at least one Core developer mandating the exact position described.

There's no rush.
Well, there is, because the opportunity cost of Bitcoin's currently capped capacity is a constant tax on new user growth. But considering that the momentum for a fork has been growing over years (first there was a lot of attempts to negotiate, then a couple of alternative clients suggested that didn't get anywhere, now there's an alternative client with noticeable support) I'm not worried if it takes another 3-6 months to move to the next stage, or even if this push peters out and we have to wait for the NEXT attempt at this.
That next attempt (if necessary, or even the one after that) will come in with even more momentum, as the need for action has only been getting stronger and in each iteration the community advocating it gets bigger and smarter and influence of the current proprietors in this controlled environment gets smaller and smaller.

That's fine, you're welcome to keep believing that until it gets to a crisis point that a hard fork becomes the only way to move forward.  Then you'll either have to change your opinion or leave Bitcoin. That's alright, we can wait.


A distributed set of miners is completely different from a central bank, that's the whole point.


It is true for fiat currency.  See the hyper inflated and now worthless Zimbabwean notes, or the Venezuelans currently exiting their currency as fast as possible. This is actually a really good example, for fiat the "miners" are the government - who 99% of the time run the currency unless it hits crisis point that 1% of the time and all the users leave in which case they can't do anything to stop it.  For the USD, we're still not that close to a 1% type event but it's happening in plenty of other fiat currencies.


Life is political, especially money, especially Bitcoin.  You can hide under a rock with your maths textbook all you want, but it won't change the fact that Bitcoin is a human invention run by people who are subject to political opinions and human psychology.

Well, there was until fiat.  It was basically just a strong tendency to gold/silver.
The only reason lots of different types of fiat can co-exist is because governments enforce taxation or settlement of legal debts paid in their specific currency through violence in their specific geography, along with occasional capital controls.

@_date: 2014-10-26 22:13:08
Totally disagree.
What you're missing is that a large part of Bitcoin is the strong political potential it has, and that that's actually largely integral to its success. In many ways, the technology cannot be divorced from the ethos that goes along with it.
I remember the last time a small, un-opinionated, rather non-commital group of people facing endless skepticism and criticism successfully boot strapped a world changing technology... said no one ever.
Bitcoiners being so radical is great, it means when they get rich they might actually make a difference.
Bitcoin adoption is happening exponentially because it does (almost) nothing but cause controversy and make headlines. It would be a bigger problem for Bitcoin if it ruffled less feathers than more.  The initial adopters come from those who are ideologically supportive, and the rest will come because Bitcoin is useful thanks to the services built by the "anti-Fed activists".
That's how you know it's going to change things, because most people are initially skeptical / don't like it / perceive it as extreme / have a strong emotional reaction to it.  It questions some very fundamental parts of the way the world operates, and that's not something to shy away from or try to paper over.

You completely missed the entire point above about the varying degrees of network effects.
Facebook + Myspace:  You're on it cos your friends are on it (1 layer effect)
eBay:  Buyers are on it cos sellers are on it, sellers are on it cos buyers are on it (2 layers)
Bitcoin:  Consumers are in it, merchants are in it, developers are in it, VC money is in it. Each of them because of all the others (4 layers).  Possible extensions to this idea even include media reports about it, financial speculators in it and existing infrastructure built for it - all of which Bitcoin towers over any alt coin.
Bitcoin's network effect is also much stronger than Facebook's because of the higher opportunity cost currencies have over social networks.  Ie.

This is literally the day Bitcoin was born, Bitcoin's birthday if you will.
Satoshi published the theoretical basis (the white paper, really good read, check it out [here]( for Bitcoin's implementation in 2008.  By this analogy this was Bitcoin's conception.
Either before, during or after working on that paper, he also wrote the very first functional version of the software to actually run the network.  Presumably he did some testing and stuff first on his own, but 3rd January 2009 was the first, public, start of the actual working Bitcoin network when Satoshi mined the Genesis block with the code that he'd written.   And so Bitcoin was born.

Not only do you have to make sure there's no unexpected code bugs (a tricky and time consuming process), but also interfacing with a supplier of coins, a reliable amount of liquidity, finding the best spots for community support and news etc. are in aggregate harder things to do than you'd expect among all the daily maintenance of customer support, maintenance, financials, employee management etc.

Yes, there is.  The network effect doesn't mean "my friend has Bitcoin" (although it does include that), it also includes:
* VCs in America are investing in the apps that we will then use
* Devs overseas are building the apps we will use
* The global market for the currency is large/liquid increasing its utility to us
* It is interoperable with all the other apps/services provided by others in the same space
People without a mobile phone at the moment obviously don't need to make the choice *right now* between Bitcoin and an alt coin, but when the time comes they will choose Bitcoin since it will still be the market leader and it's what the vast majority of services will be built for.

I never understand this "Bitcoin has no value for the huge majority of people" argument.
Obviously it does, because the number of users keep growing.  And the more users it gets, the more useful it gets to more people, and the cycle continues.  At the same time as more and more products and services come into existence via developers.
Maybe it's not "I just burnt all my fiat currency" useful to a farmer in Africa, but I think it's pretty ridiculous to say it's not useful to someone just because they haven't sought it out to adopt it.  99% of the world doesn't live in rural Africa, even if 99% of the world isn't American suburbia.  Funnily enough, it's the 98% between where plenty of people have uses for and a good chance of access to Bitcoin - but that seems largely ignored from the discussion.
Even many of my friends and I live in relatively very wealthy parts of the world with access to advanced financial services and we all still find Bitcoin has value and advantages over that.

"Violence" in the figurative sense of "with great force" rather than the literal one of "physical damage is inflicted".  Nobody gets bashed up in a Bitcoin blockchain fork.
In fact, Bitcoin was created to circumvent people to use literal violence, and has happily replaced it with a system where people mostly cooperate, and if they absolutely can't there's a final backstop of figurative "violence" (network splits, price crashes etc. but at the end of the day one chain comes out the winner).

If 90% of the hash rate goes on one chain, I don't care how many nodes are on the other chain or what rules they have for "validity", the chain being mined is going to be the valuable one, the one that sets the rules and the one that everyone uses (provided the change doesn't change the total number of Bitcoins above 21 million or start reversing past transactions, neither of which is being proposed).

2)  5 years ago, 1 Bitcoin was worth $0.  3 years ago, less than $1.  1 year ago, less than $50.  Now, around $600.  Why is it growing?  Because it is useful.  When will it stop?  As far as I can see, once it has swallowed all other commerce.






4)  Exactly, it's a chicken and egg problem, so it's also a compounding snowball.  The wheels are moving slowly, but they're starting to click into place.  1 year ago you couldn't even buy with Bitcoin on Tiger Direct, and your mother had probably never heard of Bitcoin.  Both buyer and seller have budged enough in this instance to make the transaction happen, not simply maybe, but it did happen.  Things are only getting easier, not harder.
The more merchants adopt, the more consumers adopt.  The more consumers adopt, the more merchants adopt.  There are obviously more merchants and more consumers in Bitcoin than 1 year ago, so something is working.
5)  No, you're right, they're not across the board.  But again it's incremental steps.  3 months ago there was no discounts.  6 months ago there was no accepting Bitcoin.  The non-financially privileged are making it mainstream, but you're not seeing the effects, because they're not making it not mainstream **in your area**.  Everyone else where you live has the same "but it's not a compelling case for me yet" thought.

@_date: 2015-01-01 03:13:54


It's the other way around.  If enough consumers have Bitcoin to spend, merchants will be incentivized to accept it.
Of course it's a chicken and the egg sort of problem, but the consumer side is ultimately more important.  Get Bitcoin into enough hands (some of which will even be store owners themselves, who will accept Bitcoin to increase their own stash), and merchants will adopt it not to miss out on the market.
The reverse is not necessarily true.  Every single merchant within 10 km could accept Bitcoin, but if they also accept fiat there's no guarantee any individual consumer will find it prudent to switch.  But if every single consumer within 10km has Bitcoin, you can bet merchants will work out how to accept it very rapidly.

My point stands regardless of if any other team (the irony when neither of us can say their name because of the ridiculous commenting policy here) is a devil worshipping cult or God's gift to Bitcoin. What Bitcoin needs is a DECENTRALIZED set of development teams, hopefully 5 or 10 or more eventually, just like we have with mining pools.

The banks want a slice of that, especially for dealing with younger generations who don't understand 3 day transaction times, crummy apps and who trust the government less than ever.
Thankfully for the bankers, Bitcoin is a very merciful saviour and eternally forgiving of past mistakes.

No I'm acknowledging that both are volatile, in fact Bitcoin much, much more so.
However on a long scale timeframe (like... 5 years), Bitcoin increases in value dramatically, and fiat drops dramatically.
I'm sarcastically making the point people say Bitcoin can't be a good store of value, because volatility.  This is a non-sequitur, because on large timeframes Bitcoin's volatility is hugely positive, whereas all fiat is negative.  On short timeframes Bitcoin is volatile in both directions and fiat is relatively stable, but short timeframes is not relevant for a store of value.

I guarantee you have never run a business, since you apparently value customer feedback at "mostly worthless".
Of course there's no "cost" to posting on Reddit, so apparently you think a flood of "I tried using Bitcoin and it sucked" posts is the same as "I tried using Bitcoin, wow it was way cooler than I thought".
Actually the best thing about customers is that they often give you feedback FOR FREE, and woe betide the entrepreneur who thinks "those idiots, they don't know what they want". Eventually, customers stop complaining and simply switch to another product. Bitcoin is not immune to this.
I advise you never to start a company. With an attitude of wilful ignorance of customer complaints, your company will be guaranteed to fail before it even begins.

That's $5 that at the time had a vanishingly, vanishingly small chance of success.  No, you didn't take "thousands of dollars worth of risk", because you only put in $5, but you are being rewarded with thousands of dollars for taking a $5 risk that was very important to a world changing technology at a seedling stage, not to mention never selling that $5 even after it increased magnitudes in price, crashed multiple times and had everyone around you telling you you were an idiot constantly.
Maybe you think that a few thousand dollars is a really disproportionate reward, but if Bitcoin turns out to deliver about 10% of what it potentially could, I doubt there would have been any reward to early adopters that seems unreasonable in the big picture.
Note that lottery ticket winners pay $5 for a ticket, and don't take "millions of dollars of risk", but I'd say the outcome is more than fair if it works out for them, the odds obviously aren't in their favour.  Bitcoin is the same, even up until now the odds are probably not in your favour to bet on Bitcoin, but if you do it anyway because you want to see some change made in the world (this is where the lottery ticket analogy breaks down) then you should be rewarded.

Interestingly, Bitcoin is a very useful tool for banks to cut out the middlemen *they* have to deal with. Rumour and logic dictate that they're slowly starting to clue in to this idea.


Not yet, but it will.
Traditionally the idea of a bank was to hold large amounts of your money (gold) securely for you.  This can be replaced by Bitcoin, since you can store it more securely on your own than an institution can (as you are a much smaller target, and BTC is easy to hide).
They also were supposed to make international money transfer easier, which Bitcoin also does a much better job of.
Now, they mostly lend out money they don't have.  Bitcoin can replace the lending part through crowd funding, micro loans etc. organised programmatically. This hasn't happened yet, because there's bigger fish to fry (like letting people get Bitcoin and store it safely) but it will happen.
It's true though that banks probably won't disappear, they might just have to change their core offerings or find something else to charge fees for besides storing money, having a monopoly on large scale lending and sending international transactions.

You don't understand how law works.
You can't be punished for something that isn't prohibited, but the exact interpretation of already existing laws into what is or isn't prohibited is why we have courts.
The idea of *Nulla poena sine lege* is that if I buy a Bitcoin in 2016, the government can't make a law saying "buying Bitcoin is illegal" in 2017, and then take me to court for my actions in 2016, only if I bought some more Bitcoin AFTER they'd created that law.
However, if there is ALREADY an unclear law that says "conducting certain financial transactions online is illegal" in 2015, the government can take me to court in 2017 for buying Bitcoin in 2016.  My argument is "buying Bitcoin **shouldn't** be classified under *certain financial transactions*".  The government's argument is "buying Bitcoin **should** be classified under *certain financial transactions*".
Since Bitcoin is new or possibly not fully covered by the existing laws, the judge/jury/court gets to decide whether or not "*certain financial transactions*" should be interpreted as including "buying Bitcoin". If the court thinks it should be, I'm guilty.  If they don't, I'm not.
Either way, this then provides the framework for the NEXT time someone gets taken to court for buying Bitcoin, since whether or not it breaks this law has already been decided on.

2028 is more than a decade away, after another two halvings.  By that time who knows where Bitcoin or the world will be at, we shouldn't smother the baby in the crib because of a hypothetical problem that is 10 years away at least.
Right now it is far more important that Bitcoin adds additional users than that it becomes fee-sustainable.  The latter can come later, but growing the size of Bitcoin now has all kind of benefits for Bitcoin's cultural presence, legal status, acceptance by society, economic value etc. etc. etc.

Except Bitcoin, which grows stronger by evolving through a series of competing alternatives.  There is of course a small period of crisis while one option wins out over the other, but in the end Bitcoin is better for it.
Ideally, Bitcoin is CONSTANTLY forked for improvements to stay at the cutting edge and compartmentalise systemic risk into small manageable pieces rather than letting it build up for one big catastrophe.
That's the whole point.  If you want a system that avoids taking any risks at any cost, go back to the fiat banking system and enjoy your next GFC.

There's a difference between inflationary currencies experiencing deflation (usually abruptly, rapidly and because of a collapse in demand - bad) and deflationary currencies experiencing deflation (usually consistently, slowly and because of a limited supply - good).
All modern economies are the former.  Bitcoin is the latter, and over its entire lifetime and despite a litany of problems due to its untested and novel nature, it's been experiencing growth levels no other economy is even approaching.
Edit: Note that eventually Bitcoin's economy growth rate will be consistent and slow once it's had a little more time to mature, but has been inconsistent and very rapid while still due to its limited supply to date.  This will only apply for the transitionary period.

Any amount of time longer than "I bought my coins 5 seconds ago" is too long, I don't get why people never seem to get this message no matter how many hundreds of times it's repeated.
Unless you're trading, and even then best practice is to send out your coins after you finish each trading session I've heard.
It's the exact same with backups - "Oh I was going to back it up after the holidays, but who knew while I was in Thailand that I'd drop my phone in the ocean?"

Well if you agree the Blockchain is valuable, then you'll agree that Bitcoin is valuable, as they are linked.
If you don't agree the Blockchain is valuable, I don't really know what argument I can make to convince you specifically.  Any argument I make will probably be refuted by "but my bank works fine".  And that's ok, lucky you, you live in a part of the world where banks are developed, the currency is stable, you don't need to transact internationally with any frequency and you aren't worried by capital controls or excessive government intervention.
That's great for you, but for most of the world these are problems they have to deal with.  If you don't see this utility for them, and won't adopt until after they all have (by which point Bitcoin will begin shaking up the financially stable part of the world you live in), that's fine, but you'll be in a financially worse position for it.
Ignoring any fiat/Bitcoin conversion costs, which are being rapidly driven down, sending money from America to China can be done much, much, much more efficiently and cheaper than existing networks using the US dollar or the Yuan.  This has enormous implications for remittances (Bitcoiners love that one eh?) but probably even more importantly for business.  In a world where most stuff is not made where it's sold, small advantages in facilitating international trade compound to really big deals.
I heard about women in Afghanistan who are blogging and being paid in Bitcoin.  Women in their corner of the world can't open bank accounts, are monitored by their male relatives and husbands for how much money they can own and so on.  Bitcoin is opening new avenues for them, even if only temporarily (although I think it'll stick around) for them to look after their own money and become financially independent.
In China, there are government controls on how much money can be sent abroad.  A lot of people need an out of that, and they are clueing in to Bitcoin.
In Argentina, the currency is being devalued at an incredible rate.  Bitcoin might be volatile, but even that is starting to look attractive against continual, persistent and unavoidable devaluation.
In Africa, banks are pulling out of countries where they just can't deal with the multitude of issues in providing financial services in such unstable and poor regions.  Yet Bitpesa and other companies are starting to make inroads there, because the platform they're working on is fundamentally different.
In your small corner of the world, maybe Bitcoin isn't going to change the world (yet).  But there are plenty where it is, and plenty of people who are finding a fantastic solution to their real problems.  Network effects and dominoes come to mind, and eventually everyone will have a good enough reason to convert.  If you don't understand or can't imagine this happening, then either I'm crazy and the constant flood of new online articles about "New bitcoin start up I didn't know about solves problem I didn't know about in place I rarely think about" isn't real, or you're a person without a lot of foresight.

If anything the attack is by Core.
It is **indisputable** that the block size limit is CURRENTLY preventing Bitcoin's growth - in fact it has been for a while.  Core is *actively* preventing Bitcoin's growth *right now*, I don't know what could be more of an "attack" on Bitcoin than that.


By "Bitcoin goes under attack" you mean "Bitcoin has a lot of users who want to transact and they get frustrated when their transactions are expensive/slow".  I don't understand why block size limit supporters seem to be AGAINST increased use of Bitcoin. Somehow they think making Bitcoin a system for the privileged few instead of an open, equitable protocol (the original point of the movement) is a good idea.
They see some kind of malicious "attack" every time Bitcoin gets more popular instead of the much more obvious and benign explanation that more and more people are finding Bitcoin useful and want to use it. After all, that is what it's there for. Maybe these people just don't get out enough, seeing the increasing awareness of Bitcoin around me is all I need to convince me there's no "spam attack", just more genuine interest.
@_date: 2017-02-23 06:11:29
That's not an answer to my question.
If we get a block size increase, we can always put in SegWit later or at the same time.  Plenty of people who like a block size increase have no problem with SegWit, it's just we can't afford to compromise any more because all the "compromises" of the past have been one way lies (e.g. The Hong Kong agreement, now objectively broken).
The reverse is not true, because despite massive technological advancements since 2008 and no argument at all why 1MB isn't a totally arbitrary cap (why not 0.9 MB? Or 1.1MB?) the position of Core is still "No block size increase", apparently ever. We are in grave danger of Bitcoin NEVER moving away from 1MB, which is only going to do so much even with Lightning Network and the kitchen sink.
The most important thing to Bitcoin's survival right now is that a precedent is not set to avoid hard forks or a block size increase at all costs.  If it is, I'm going to have to start looking very hard into altcoins to find the one that is going to take Bitcoin's place.

There is no day of mass adoption.  Stop waiting for one.  You will not wake up one day and discover that every member of your family acquired Bitcoin last night.  
By now, we're past the peak of the bell curve for awareness (depending on your locality).  You'll be able to observe the gaps being filled in over the next year or so.
Adoption is also a bell curve, lagging a couple of years behind awareness.
Open your eyes and look around, and you will see "mass awareness" (the central portion of the awareness bell curve) happening everywhere.  "Mass adoption" is just the slower bell curve follower of "mass awareness".

I'd say it's already pretty competitive, given it's just downloading an app.
Sure, *once you have a bank card* it might seem easier, but getting one requires a bunch of set-up and signing papers and so on.  Most people have already done that, but it's not the case for everyone, especially younger people.  Getting people into Bitcoin is about a hundred times easier than converting them to your bank.
Also, at least in Australia, phone-to-phone bank transfers using the bank apps are a nightmare unless you are both with the same bank, both already have the app, take several days, and often have not insignificant fees attached.  
Scanning a QR code isn't really that big of a deal.

If your local area is anything like me, familiarity with the word "Bitcoin" has been exploding, people are more and more willing to discuss or receive a small amount, Bitcoin ATMs and accepting merchants are starting to appear, localbitcoins sellers and volume is going through the roof.
If you need any more convincing, just think that when Bitcoin dropped from $32 to $2, plenty of the developers stuck around to keep building on Bitcoin.  They won't stop at $100 either.
Discussion about Bitcoin and uses for it are being implemented all over the globe, and you never even hear about most of it.  Check out a few of the [Bitcointalk foreign language forum boards]( all with plenty of activity.
And most importantly of all: [is the network still processing transactions](  Yeap, looks fine.  6 years on, and it's still working just as well, actually better, than when it began.

What you need to realise is that a government is not a monolithic entity, it's a collection of individuals with their own personal interests.  Those people coordinate for mutual benefit while everything is working ok, but if that falters then their personal needs very rapidly come to displace their commitment to sacrificing for the greater good.
As people in a government each realise the state is about to collapse, they don't coordinate a government-saving response, they individually ditch to save their own hides.  The government then spirals into ruin super fast and the power vacuum leaves space for the sudden construction of a new system.  See: any political or military revolution in history.

That's what's slowly happening, it's just that bigger blocks aren't going to fork immediately, but when they have a majority consensus (probably 70%+). Given they started with 0%, current progress looks promising.
The need for 100% agreement is a fantasy and on its face ridiculous as a practical solution in a world where people are already highly divided.
As fees rise higher and higher, the pressure to switch to bigger blocks simply increases and increases. At some point, support for bigger blocks will hit a critical mass and nearly everyone who wasn't already on board with it will say "Fuck it, at this point it's what we have to do".
About five diehards will be left behind clinging to their tattered beliefs that Bitcoin can't be forked successfully without 100% compliance of every single developer/user/miner/whiner and that Bitcoin shouldn't be a system used for every day payments like it used to be. Everyone else will move on with their life and enjoy the decrease in fees and confirmation times.
Maybe a couple of nodes in shit countries will fall off, but the ability to onboard new users again will provide just as many opportunities for new nodes to be started, as well as the resulting price increase and attention starting a new hype cycle.
Don't believe me?  Just watch it happen over the next 2 years, there's already enough seedlings for me to believe either this has to happen or Core has to realise "Shit if we don't raise the blocksize, we're going to be kings of nothing".  Either way, as you said, a decision will be forced one way or the other.

There has been years of negotiations over the best way to increase the transaction capacity on the Bitcoin network.
No compromise has been reached, and eventually communication has broken down to the point that it looks like the only solution is to let the two sides each try their own method and see which comes out the winner.
The result is the possibility for a hard fork which creates two versions of Bitcoin.  In all likelihood, there won't even be a fork because once one side has a clear majority everyone else will switch to that side to avoid being left behind. It's possible that if one side can't get a clear majority though or if some people on the losing side want to hang on to their version of Bitcoin that for a while there will be two competing Bitcoins.
As a user, don't worry you have all of your coins on both sides of the split so you can wait and see who comes out the winner.
This isn't something to be afraid of, it's actually one of the most special things about Bitcoin, that this system of conflict resolution is available as a backstop to the kind of halted progress we have now. Imagine how many less wars the world would have if every group of people that wanted to do something differently could peacefully split off into their own country and see how things went.

No, they aren't.
Any Bitcoin someone has already spent do not give them some kind of mystical lasting ability to influence the system (for example by selling on one fork and buying on another in the case of a hard fork). As soon as they leave your possession, the influence granted by owning those Bitcoins leaves you and transfers to their new owner.
Of course this can be regained by buying more Bitcoin, but in your example someone who never saves any coins for more than a short period of time will never have any more influence than in that short window they are holding those coins.

Well they sure had plenty of time to code up SegWit, but just conveniently "forgot" or "ran out of time" to get around to the block size increase (which has a far lower coding/testing burden AND is listed first in the [agreement roadmap](


This is a classic evasion of responsibility, suddenly the old deal is being redefined like something out of 1984 "We got what we wanted on our end of the deal by doing what we wanted, AND according to us you got what YOU wanted because our end of the deal is also now suddenly satisfying your end of the deal - even though they were supposed to be a trade."
Tell you what, how about you send me 3 Bitcoin and I'll send you anything of your choice.  After you've sent me the Bitcoin, I'll make sure to let you know that what you actually chose was the opportunity to send me 3 Bitcoin, so now we should both be happy.


Well there's clearly no consensus SegWit is a good idea, unless of course what you mean by consensus is "everyone I agree with agrees that its a good idea", which is circular and honestly pathetically ludicrous.


Why do I keep hearing this "hundreds of developers" line?  It's total bullshit.  Yes, there are technically hundreds of contributors on the Bitcoin repo but The VAST majority of them have submitted one or less code request, hundreds are inactive, even some of the major ones like Jeff Garzik, Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn have been forced out of the project.

I honestly think SegWit is probably a good idea.  I'm actually probably in favour of putting it in the code.  Unfortunately, what I think is a threat to Bitcoin is the monopolisation of the development culture such that any block size increase ever is basically ruled out, when Bitcoin was designed to have no block size limit at all.
I'd be in support of a 2MB + Segwit soft fork, although I'd be super wary about it because any kind of "We'll do 2MB now, and then see about future block size increases later" type promises are not worth the electrons they would be printed on, and in all likelihood we would be back at this same position in 12 months time with more blockading of blocksize increases as part of some kind of political play that goes against the obvious need to allow more on chain transactions.
In any case, I think in a hard fork bigger blocks is going to win.  I also think that it's incredibly premature of Bitcoin Core supporters to rubbish such an occurrence as impossible - before any of this started Bitcoin Core was 99.9% of the clients running on the network.  This is the first time we're seeing a diversity of clients and development teams in the ecosystem start to form, obviously a good thing for decentralisation, and while it might not be perfect or immediately overthrow the current arrangements, the potential is definitely there.  There will be some growing pains, but in the end Bitcoin will be stronger for having removed yet another source of centralised control.
In five years time there might be 5 or 10 different development teams and clients, and that would be fantastic.  But someone has to break the ice from 1 to 2 (especially if the 2nd manages to get majority control and force Core to be more responsive to the needs of the network), and that's what's happening now.

I can see the logic on the other one, but if you're scared of competing implementations in Bitcoin then you should sell out right now.
That's like being scared of competing currencies, or competing businesses, or competing miners. The whole point of Bitcoin was to make everything a competition to let the free market hack it out, and that includes the clients running on the network.

The people demanding black bitcoins are already beyond the point of caring about legal consequences, in fact that's the reason they want them.
If you need black bitcoins to buy drugs, you're already buying drugs and breaking the law so you don't care if the Bitcoin transaction is illegal too.
Demand for black bitcoins would presumably be less than for white bitcoins, but supply of black bitcoins would be exponentially smaller and shrinking than of white bitcoins, so black bitcoins would be much more valuable.

* Appointed by Satoshi as a good person to carry forward Bitcoin, as in Satoshi's judgement he had the character and understanding of the vision required.

Because 1 month =/= 10 years?
Even if you think Bitcoin will be a massively profitable investment over 5+ years, which it has been, it could still be a massively losing investment in the immediate forthcoming months, which it also has been many times in its history. When expecting a massive upside, losing a small amount by buying over time in a rising market is not a big deal.  In the event of a massive downside, lowering your cost average by buying over time in a falling market might be very very helpful if the initially expected investment time frame of 10 years can't be maintained for any number of reasons.

This is the single most fundamental misunderstanding of Bitcoin I have ever read.
Yes, a hard fork would create temporary confusion and a dip in the market price.  No, it wouldn't kill Bitcoin, the network effect would pull people to one side or the other very quickly.  Yes, this would create a stronger Bitcoin in the long term.
Bitcoin was designed to have a community hard fork as a last potential backstop to the kind of "Listen to us, we know best, or just look at what will happen to Bitcoin if we're not allowed in control" centralised fear mongering that we have right now.  If you allow FUD to scare you off from ever hard forking then congratulations, you now have the same governance model as the rest of the world - a coercive CENTRALIZED GOVERNMENT ruled by fallible individuals rather than the marketplace.
Thank god that your misunderstanding of this does nothing to change the fact that a hard fork is still possible.

In percentage terms, yes it is.

It's still 10x, but the first requires about $189 million increase in value while the second requires a $189 billion increase.  Those are very different numbers and require very different amounts of Bitcoin adoption in the real world.
Marketcap at $1 = 1 x 21 million (I know not all BTC are mined yet, but let's keep this simple)
Marketcap at $10 = 10 x 21 million
Change = $210 million - $21 million = $189 million
Marketcap at $1000 = 1 000 x 21 million = $21 billion
Marketcap at $10 000 = 10 000 x 21 million = $210 billion
Change = $210 billion - $21 billion = $189 billion

You're confusing two separate things here.
Bitcoin transactions **transmit** in seconds. They **settle** after several confirmations, which may be an hour or two.
Visa transactions **transmit** in seconds too. They **settle** several weeks/months later once everything works its way through the banking system.
Visa actually settles MUCH slower, but it doesn't appear that way to you the user because they lie to you and say "Thanks for your transaction!" and you never hear any more about it unless you're in the minority that actually gets involved in some kind of chargeback dispute.
Bitcoin companies could do exactly the same thing, and probably will, we just need to improve a little on our ability to detect 0-confirmation double spends and have the industry UI designers move to the Visa model.

900kb means almost all of the time it's full, and some of the time the blocks are found faster than average so don't have the entire window to fill up (which is never going to change) or the miners don't always include transactions from the mempool when starting a block.
Just because the average block size isn't 1000kb doesn't mean the blocks have plenty of space.  At 900kb, already the vast majority of them don't.


No one wants to use the network for nothing, no wonder you don't understand the argument if you think of it as a massive straw man. Some people just want the network fee to be a supply / demand equation of the free market, not a "supply restricted by arbitrary limits" / "demand influenced by the arbitrary supply limit" equation.

RESISTANCE to change is a good and valuable feature of Bitcoin I totally agree.  That's very different from an INABILITY to change, which Bitcoin of course does not have.  If it did, everyone would still be using Bitcoin v0.1.


Classic straw man.  I never said I supported a coin that can be changed by an individual. I support a coin that can be changed by the political process of a code upgrade by a majority hash rate of the miners with additional user support.


... and if enough people are convinced, then you can enjoy your mathematics as the sole user of a dead "Bitcoin" (the real Bitcoin will have moved on) worth exactly as much value as you and you alone give it, because no-one else will value it at anything, having all moved on to the upgrade chosen by a *political* process.
@_date: 2017-01-28 22:13:43
Not sure if serious.
The process of signalling for a future version of Bitcoin and/or code upgrades spreading across miners and nodes has absolutely nothing to do with maths and everything to do with politics.
Bitcoin relies on its ability to upgrade to keep ahead of its competitors or to respond to threats to survive as much as any other aspect.

It's the exact opposite, if no one wants to hold on to it (everyone wants to "trade" it aka get rid of it) then it's worthless. It's only a store of value (and increasingly a desirable currency) if more people want to hold on to it than not.
Think about the US Dollar. How many people in the world would like it if the amount of USD they had sitting in their bank account or under their mattress increased? All those people compete to do exactly that, which is why if you have USD it's very easy to trade it for other stuff.

It's almost at that stage online, and soon enough it will be spreading into the "real world" around them, aka their friends, relatives, work colleagues or whoever will use, discuss or think of Bitcoin as a given like electricity or the automobile. At SOME stage, the Buttcoiners have to either admit (at least to themselves, they won't do it publicly on Reddit) that they were wrong and find something to do besides hating in If not, we can watch them slowly become the new lunatic, reality denying fringe of publicly pitied lost little souls on the Internet.

It's been years since I was surprised or excited to hear someone mention or bring up Bitcoin unprompted.
If you've never heard Bitcoin mentioned in your real life, you're the one living in the metaphorical (or possibly even literal) basement.
Edit: Here's an interesting demonstration of this. You know who Emma Watson is, right? So do plenty of other people you know, right? Well [Bitcoin is approximately as much on the global radar as she is](

No I agree it's not ALL about the money, the money's a part of it though.
No stock inspires a forum full of as much salty angst like Bitcoin has with Buttcoin. The other half of your motivation is that you're all too proud to admit that Bitcoin supporters are and have always been smarter and more future-prescient than you. That's tough for a forum full of "I'm so much smarter than everyone else" children. Problem is, now you're in a no-win situation. 
At best, you can be the salty whiner that finally realised he was on the wrong team and changed his mind (hopefully graciously, Bitcoin will forgive you). At worst, you can continue to watch as Bitcoin consolidates its place as an acceptable, valuable technology inch by inch in the world around you while you stay the bitter cynics whining about how stupid (the increasingly vindicated) Bitcoiners are - making you an increasingly out of touch neanderthal stuck in a past where Bitcoin was still relatively unproven and being a condescending know-it-all wasn't blatantly ludicrous.
The irony is that Bitcoiners did start out as the societally ridiculous ones in basements, but the scale is sliding irreversibly to Buttcoiners being the societally ridiculed ones in basements. Bitcoiners are being rewarded with historical vindication and wealth for their passion, Buttcoiners with eternal proof they're not as smart as they think they are and the pity of society.

Also, a kilobit is a thousand Bitcoins.  And a millibit is 1/1000th of a Bitcoin.  Just like a Kilogram = 1000 grams and a milligram = 1/100th of a gram.  Kilometre = 1000 metres and millimetre = 1/1000th of a metre.

The entire reason decentralisation is good is that people are free to express different opinions, and then enact them if it comes to that.  This creates a time of crisis but also produces a stronger result once things fall one way or the other.
If you think Bitcoin is so fragile that it needs to be "protected" against hard forks, you don't understand Bitcoin's development model.  If Bitcoin can't ever be hard forked because it scares some people, then we're already as bad as the banking system we're trying to replace. The banking sector is how it is because absolutely everyone is terrified that one card might be pulled out (one bank fails aka "hard forks") and bring the whole house down.  Bitcoin doesn't have this problem, because everyone is always pulling out cards (or at least, threatening to) and the system is designed to account for and benefit from that.
Sounds like you'd be better off signing up to the Federal Reserve and US Government bailout team, who will "keep things stable no matter what".  Bitcoin makes no such promises of stability (which are impossible through centralised control in the long run anyway), only continued innovation and the ultimate decision maker being an uncontrolled market.

What he's saying is that less value was transacted in Bitcoin than in Bulgarian currency.
To him, Bulgarian currency is basically worthless, as in he never has and never will use Bulgarian currency.  Therefore Bitcoin is also worthless.
It's unreal to think he doesn't recognize that there's billions of other people on the planet and just because no one he knows uses Bulgarian currency doesn't mean it's actually worth 0 and that there's actually probably millions that like it.
By his same logic, any song he hasn't listened to has 0 listeners, any book he hasn't read has 0 readers and any movie he hasn't seen has 0 viewers.
Alternatively: Relative to the largest currency in the world (USD), Bitcoin's volume is tiny.  Therefore it's worthless.  This completely ignores the fact that there's loads of other currencies that operate on a national scale that are the same size or smaller, plus Bitcoin has grown in the past and will continue to in the future, until one day maybe it WON'T be tiny next to the USD and this guy will look like such a fool.

Actually, you should pledge to run a node if the bitcoin price goes BELOW a certain price, not above it.
If the price is rising, the network is fine and the market is confirming it. Running extra nodes is a nice idea, but not necessary.
If the price is dropping, it means the network is insufficient to either effectively run or convince the market of its decentralisation. Running extra nodes is necessary to change this.

If you're being sarcastic, having minor disagreements and a variety of running clients is more decentralisation though.
If you're not being sarcastic, then you don't understand Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is more valuable the more decentralisation it has.  However it is also more valuable the more transactions it can process.  The question is striking a balance.
Personally, I'm in favour of raising the cap. I was excited about this latest rally until I sent a 36cent fee transaction that still took ten plus blocks to get a single confirmation. I think it's totally unreasonable to make the argument "we'll raise block size EVENTUALLY", as if there has been no development in computer hardware in the several years since the cap was introduced.  Anyone who thinks raising to a 2MB block size is totally unreasonable and would immediately cause the entire network to suffer irreparable damage is simply a nut job.

I don't need to actually get any value out of my Network B transaction. The point of the attack is to kill the network, not make fraudulent profit. I don't need to make money out of frauding Network B, the goal is just to prove it is vulnerable and worthless so that everyone uses Network A instead.
Obviously this is a hypothetical to prove a point (that hashing power is king), not a realistic or likely scenario where anyone would actually think this was a good idea (luckily we have Bitcoin's strong economic incentives).
Edit: Just looked into the ETH/ETC case, it proves my point perfectly.






ETH has about 7 times the hashing power of ETC.  Lo and behold, it is also 7 times as valuable.  If the ETH miners could be bothered to coordinate, they could dedicate a segment of their miners to double spending on ETC until it was worthless.  This would probably cost them more in lost ability to mine ETH than it would earn them by killing off ETC so they don't bother, but this proves ETH is the "real" Ethereum because it could kill ETC any time it wanted.  Unfortunately for Ethereum holders the "real" Ethereum also has the property that Vitalik can reorganize the blockchain whenever he wants which is why Ethereum won't replace Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-22 15:08:46
This has happened to me several times.
@_date: 2016-12-19 15:30:23
In your example, your difficulty-1 chain doesn't have a majority of hashing power at any point in time. No matter how many blocks you produce, your chain has less proof of work the second the main network produces 1 block.  If you want to celebrate for that intervening 10 minutes (on average), that you are on the "real Bitcoin" and no-one else is, go right ahead, you are technically correct.  But you only have until the next mainnet block is produced to convince a majority of hashing power to join your fork and if they don't then once again you will no longer be on "the real Bitcoin" as soon as that next block is found.
In all of my examples, we were discussing a fork from the current network that had a majority of the current network's hash rate.
The chain with the most proof of work invested is Bitcoin.  I said the longest chain, but I suppose "most proof of work" is a narrower and more correct way of saying it.  The two are the same when assuming a majority of hashing power which is the cause of my oversight.

Except that it can...  Forking to bigger blocks would let us see the impact of increasing transaction capacity vs (potentially) reducing decentralisation (a tiny bit).
If it was harmful, it could always be forked back.
You might not think this is a good idea, but it's just factually incorrect to say it couldn't be done.

But what I'm saying is not me imposing an arbitrary rule, it's a fact by definition, like how 1+1=2.
It's the fundamental difference between a decentralized blockchain and a centralised database.  A decentralized database has the property that its validity is determined by chain length, a centralised database validity is determined by the owner of the database.
A database that has its validity determined by anything other than chain length is not a decentralized blockchain.  By definition.

@_date: 2016-12-20 04:30:49
No I wouldn't.
This is my point about the difference between theory and reality.
In theory, with economics out the window it is possible for a majority of miners to create their own long chain and make the chain the users want to use invalid.
In reality, the miners have a profit incentive to listen to users and none of this would ever happen.
The point still stands that the only and sole objective measure of Bitcoin's validity is the longest proof-of-work chain, in theory (where this could actually matter) and in reality (where it never has and for the foreseeable future never will).

Why does how it's generated matter?  You can't pay taxes with it now, but might be able to in the future.  And of course you can get paid in Bitcoin, if the employer wants to pay with Bitcoins and the employee wants to be paid in Bitcoin, they get paid in Bitcoin. Plenty of people already do this.


Yes, that's why everyone's constantly incentivised to increase their processing power to make the network more and more secure.


That's one thing it's meant for, but not the only thing.


Yes, although they're not called servers, they're called miners and nodes.


1. Unlike fiat currency, it's perfectly safe to hold large amounts of Bitcoin yourself (instead of leaving it with an institution), in fact it is recommended.  This removes any risk of the holding party (such as a bank, or Mt Gox), going bust.
2. Because there is no "bail outs" for places that screwup, over time places with shitty security go bankrupt and stronger institutions take their place.  This does not replace  in terms of securing your Bitcoins, but it is a nice bonus.

Changes to Bitcoin really only require a 51% majority of hashing power.
The devs like to impose higher limits to ensure the transition is smooth because we're in an environment where no miners are truly invested in being uncooperative, but it's not strictly necessary.  If there was any malicious mining trying to block progress, they just wouldn't bother putting in the additional helper rails and the majority would still upgrade and force the minority to either upgrade or become irrelevant.
In other words, there's nothing that needs to be done, Bitcoin is already future proofed against 5% mining power sabotage.

Nobody has ever tried it, but that's not because you can't.
Yes, of course the current nodes would ignore them.  But they'd no longer be part of Bitcoin, they'd be part of an altcoin.  With 51% of the hashing power you have started a new chain which will grow with more proof of work.  That would be the "real Bitcoin", and not the original (and now diminished) mining network, regardless of how many nodes stayed with the old network and how many switched to the new (as long as the new network had at least three nodes perhaps, as a minimum functional value).
Bitcoin's trustless nature is built on having the longest proof of work chain because of the largest mining network.  Without that, nothing else matters.

My network of 80% hash rate with my code against your 20% hash rate with your code.  Same situation, I double spend on your network and it's worthless, you don't do anything to mine.
The thing that makes the set of rules in the code valid and worthwhile is the unsurpassed mining network backing it.  No point coding a fixed cap of 21 million if anyone can just change the code or double spend.  And what stops that? The hash rate of the miners.
How are you a Bitcoin developer that doesn't understand why we have miners?  If the code or nodes or users or anything else was sufficient to prevent double spending, we wouldn't bother wasting so much electricity on mining.

As a software developer, the goal is always to be "technically right".
Like it or not, Bitcoin is first and foremost a feat of computer engineering (more than game theory, economics, political philosophy or anything else) which makes an acute awareness of details like this a very, very valuable thing.  "Close enough" or "but you know what I meant" doesn't cut it when a bug in the code could cause enormous and potentially irreversible loss of value for everyone in the ecosystem.
Just look at the DAO in Ethereum and their ensuing ETH/ETC split for proof.

I'll read the whitepaper, you need to UNDERSTAND the white paper.  Start with these sentences.






The miners "vote" on the longest chain by contributing to it.  And the longest chain is the only one that is objectively secure, decentralized and trustworthy.  Making it, ta da, "the real Bitcoin".  That's the entire point of a blockchain, and what separates it from a MySQL database running on your laptop.

You can not consider it "the real Bitcoin", but that doesn't change the reality that it would have the most proof of work and so is still the real Bitcoin.
Same way you can not consider 1+1=2 "the real maths" but that doesn't change maths, it just makes you wrong.
If miners never switch, then everyone else is on NewCoin and will need some new branding because Bitcoin would still be what the miners are mining to make the longest proof of work chain.

But probably not sufficient, and there's no reason we can't have both.


I still don't really buy this, certainly a position of 0 compromise on block size is ludicrous given the past and future improvements in storage capacity. Obviously, larger block size puts more pressure on storage at nodes.  A [2 Terrabye Harddrive is $70]( at the first link on Google, and probably cheaper if you looked around.  Almost everyone who already runs a node has already gone to enough hassle and expense that I highly, highly doubt that would seriously change the equation and cause them to stop running their node.
On the other hand, on chain scaling will eventually increase decentralisation itself anyway, the Lightning network maybe keeps nodes decentralized but it introduces a new layer of payment hubs that themselves start getting centralised.
More transactions allows the value of Bitcoin to increase and more users to participate in the network - increasing the pool of people who potentially would run a node.  We might raise the block size and discover that this factor is more significant than the people who shut down their nodes over $70.  There's no way to know unless we try, and a block size raise to 2MB is not going to completely destroy Bitcoin, or even necessarily damage it.

... but it is.
The price of Bitcoin has generally increased over the last 7 years, in fact it has increased at an astounding rate, making it a "profitable company".
The miners don't care how their profit incentive is funded, as long as it is. It makes no difference to the "profitability" of Bitcoin if that money is coming from people bidding up Bitcoin on the market or transaction fees.  Mining rewards are subsidising transaction fees, but they aren't subsidising Bitcoin's market cap (the measure of its "profitability").
Sustainability is a completely different question.

The quick answers


The Bitcoin source code, run on all of the miners/nodes in the network, awards new Bitcoins to the miner who solves each block.  This happens on average every 10 minutes and is currently worth 12.5 Bitcoins. 


He was a genius.


Cryptography nerds though it was cool.  Someone traded 10 000 Bitcoins for a pizza.  Bitcoins gained a market value and the limited supply meant they increased in value. Bitcoin was the only way to buy drugs on the Dark Net or donate to wikileaks, increasing demand. Libertarians adopted Bitcoin. A lot of people said Bitcoin would die but it didn't. I adopted Bitcoin. You adopted Bitcoin.


As above, the new Bitcoin are given to individual miners when they solve blocks. The whole network agrees on this without a central authority (yes, it's pretty magic).

What's not useful about something that can buy coffee?
Bitcoin doesn't have to be ONLY unique uses to be useful.  A car doesn't have to only be able to travel on roads that no other cars can to be useful. It's the opposite, a car is most useful if it can do everything other cars can plus some that it can't.  Bitcoin is like that, ideally it can do every transaction that gold or fiat can, plus some that it can't, making it *very useful*.
You seem to think Bitcoin is only good if it gets held by large nation states and used to settle national debts in a couple of hundred transactions each year. That's the exact opposite to the reason Bitcoin was invented, which was to allow everyone to transact freely from the nation state and lower economic barriers to everyone globally.
I'm assuming what you think because you haven't explained what you consider a "useful solution".  Apparently it's not something something "useful", aka "that anyone can use".

You don't get it.  The longest chain IS the valid chain. In every circumstance. Always. If your chain is not the longest, it is not valid.
Imagine, irrespective of any other circumstances, two competing Bitcoin blockchains.
Chain A - 1000 blocks
Chain B - 1010 blocks
In a vacuum, Chain B is, by definition, the valid chain (because it is the longest). I know you want to protest this, but just calm down for a second and read the rest of my post.
The only measure of validity of a blockchain is length.  That's the whole point, there is no arbitrary authority or even community saying "I like this one more", in the end the validity can be objectively measured by simply counting the blocks in the chain.
If you need [Satoshi's words instead of mine]( here's how he expressed the exact same idea in the whitepaper:


Now, economics and so forth can impact which chain is the longest by incentivising miners to mine on one chain over another.  And since the economics is a snowball, once one chain starts winning it tends to become the undisputed king very quickly.
So imagine now we introduce massive community support for Chain A, the SHORTER chain. People sell Chain B, buy Chain A, exchanges accept Chain A coins but not Chain B coins etc.  As a result, miners switch to mining Chain A, and pretty quickly Chain A becomes longer.
At this point, Chain A is now the valid chain, because it is the longest.  But the process of switching from Chain B to Chain A is undoubtedly a switch from Bitcoin to an altcoin (which then becomes Bitcoin once it is the longest).
This whole thing is an unlikely situation and as far as I know has never happened, because miners and the community sync up super quickly.  Miners aren't trying to create a long chain of Bitcoin blocks that no one wants to use, just like people aren't trying to use a Bitcoin chain with no mining security, the two are symbiotic.
However, in the unfathomable case of a split, technically the Miners chain would be "the real" Bitcoin and the shorter chain everyone else was on would be an altcoin.  This might (and probably would) change rapidly, I agree users have the final say, but from a theoretical standpoint the miners determine "the real" Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-20 04:34:24


Yes it would.  That's functionally equivalent to someone making some "upgrades" to the Bitcoin code (raising the coin cap etc. so it is how Litecoin has it) and then convincing the majority of miners to upgrade.  Bam, "the real Bitcoin".
No one has made changes that radical but that's just a question of degree.  That process (changes are made, majority of miners accept them and upgrade) is how every version of "the real Bitcoin" has followed from the previous version right back to Satoshi's original client.

But they CAN confiscate other people's Bitcoin...  If you had 51% of the hashing power you could introduce a code update on your fork that hardcoded transferring Bitcoins from other addresses into yours.
The reason they don't isn't because it's impossible, it's because it would instantly make Bitcoins worthless as everyone tried to cash out as the price plummeted to 0.  If you've got millions invested in mining hardware, then going out of your way to collapse Bitcoin to 0 is a pretty stupid move.
On top of this, the current distributed state of mining means the miners would have to AGREE who to defraud.  When it's in none of their collective interest to defraud anyone, and unlikely they would each have a motive to target the same individual address even if they were.
The prevention of this kind of miner shenanigans is in economics, game theory and social contracts not code or mining hardware distribution.  This is the genius of Bitcoin, it ties together so many disparate fields to solve a problem that none of them could individually.

Everyone is on the second chain, so miners switch over to the normal rules version.  But BEFORE THEY DO, TECHNICALLY, the "real" Bitcoin is the one the miners are on.
I do not support any weird stuff being done to the Bitcoin blockchain, nor do I think it will be.

Yes there is.  The fork with more hash rate by definition IS BITCOIN. The fork with less hash rate is the altcoin.
It's not up to you, or Satoshi, or anyone else to say "I don't like this fork, therefore it can't be Bitcoin".  The longest chain is and always will be Bitcoin.  BY DEFINITION.  The foundation of Bitcoin is "longest chain wins, no exceptions, no ifs ands or buts, no authorities arbitrarily imposing their favourite rules. Longest chain = undisputed winner".
If the longest chain has some features you don't like, tough luck, get on board or waste your time on an increasingly worthless altcoin.  But it's not and never will be the people on the longest chain fraudulently claiming to be using Bitcoin.  If you don't want to use the longest chain, then YOU are the one pretending to be using Bitcoin when you are not.

The reason the black market was the first thing onto Bitcoin was because it needed it more.  Thus it was lower risk and more profitable, providing the seed for an economy which is now transitioning to support more "white market" activity.
Take this scenario:
Bitcoin is a new and powerful but legally ambiguous asset.
Option A: Build for the black market. Legally ambiguous downside becomes irrelevant. Users have a high risk tolerance and willingness to try new technology.
Option B: Build for the white market. Legally ambiguous nature could make everything you do worthless arbitrarily at any time. Users are afraid of taking risks and are difficult to convince to try something new. 
If you would choose Option B, then I guarantee you do not own or run a business and never will.

In an ideal world, everyone understands Bitcoin and uses it to store their Bitcoin in their own wallet.  In reality, Bitcoin is new and unfamiliar to most people, plus some people can't be bothered to store their own Bitcoin (even though not doing so is much less secure).  As a result, Bitcoin storage systems exist to help new users as they learn about Bitcoin.  This isn't ideal from a security point of view, but it's better than no one getting into Bitcoin at all because it is too difficult.  Over time, services are finding ways to make Bitcoin storage both easy to use, and securely in control of the user (for example Coinbase's multisig Vault).  As long as you keep a backup of the seed word and use a reputable wallet, the Bitcoin on your phone should be secure (as long as someone else doesn't get access to your phone).


No one can stop you BROADCASTING a transaction, which is the general meaning of the word "uncensorable" or as you are saying a little less correctly "unstoppable".
Miners like including transactions in blocks to get fees.  If your transaction is not being approved, you can submit it again with a higher fee to increase the incentive for one of them to do so.  At some size fee or another, one of the miners is going to say "man, I really want that bitcoin fee, I should put this in my block".
The only way NO miners would ever accept your transaction is if a single miner both has a malicious agenda against you specifically (unlikely/unreasonable) plus control of majority of the network (generally unfeasible). Except for when Satoshi first started Bitcoin, there has only been a single time in Bitcoin's history a miner had control of 51% of the network and it lasted less than 8 hours as everyone flipped out for exactly this reason.


Miners function is to secure the network by preventing double spends and maintaining the blockchain.  If there was no miners, there is nothing stopping me sending my 1 Bitcoin to John and the same Bitcoin to Sally, making Bitcoin worthless because anyone can spend any amount of it that they want.
The way this works is through a thing called "proof of work".  Imagine it like a sequence of giant sudoku puzzles, that all of the miners are constantly trying to solve (in Bitcoin this is called "hashing"). Each puzzle (a block of transactions) takes about 10 minutes to solve, but less than 1 second to check it's correct. This is true regardless of how many miners there are, the puzzle shrinks and contracts (changes difficulty) so that it always takes about 10 minutes to solve regardless of how many miners there are working on it.  Therefore, if a miner finds the solution to the current puzzle and publishes it (which starts a new puzzle), all of the other miners instantly know that they should stop working on the old puzzle and begin the new puzzle within 1 second, plus they know they should reward the miner who solved the previous puzzle with some new Bitcoins.  We know that the Bitcoin network is secure because there are more miners (hash rate) working on solving sudoku puzzles honestly than there are trying to scam us by solving the sudoku puzzle first for their own benefit. Any individual defectors who try to scam the network have to be able to solve the sudoku puzzles faster than everyone else combined (have a majority of the total hash rate) or they are wasting their time - because they won't be able to work through the sequence of consecutive puzzles as fast as everyone else combined, so they either need to switch to the honest sequence (blockchain) or get left behind. This puts all of the miners in effectively forced cooperation, which is a pretty incredible economic and game theory incentive achievement.
This is the best I could do as an ELI5, it's honestly a pretty complicated process, if you still don't understand I'm happy to answer any further questions or if you Google "Bitcoin mining" there are a lot of explanations.


A node is basically a miner that does everything except actually mine for Bitcoin.  It's a computer that stores the blockchain, provides past information to other nodes or to the miners, validates transactions and broadcasts new transactions to other nodes or to the miners. This helps to keep Bitcoin decentralized and uncensorable.  Nodes also "vote" on upgrades to the Bitcoin protocol by choosing which version of the software to run, although exactly how much this matters relative to the miners is a subject of some debate.

If the car is red RIGHT NOW, then the best we can say is that in 2140 the car is EXPECTED to be red, you can't say that in 2140 it is guaranteed to be red (like you said, it might get painted in the meantime).  Same thing with Bitcoin, we expect there will be 21 million coins in the future, but we won't know for sure until it happens.

Explain where.
- Bitcoin is trusted because it has the longest chain with the most proof-of-work. This stands in place of a third party to prevent double spending.
- Having thousands of transaction validating nodes, exchanges, users, developers or anything else is *less important* to trust in the network than having the most proof of work.  A chain with 2 exchanges and 80% of the mining power is far, far superior to one with 15 exchanges and 20% of the mining power - the latter can be double spent and defrauded any time by the former.  If you would invest in the latter and not the former, I'd love to take your money.
Most people in this thread seem to disagree with point 1, which is frankly unbelievable.  The rest seem to think that point 2 is more important than point 1, which is a little more understandable because it's a difference between theory and practice but it's still wrong.

Bitcoin is right at the precipice of breaking new highs since the bottom at sub $200 in January of 2015.
Having nearly quadrupled in price in the last two years, literally every other metric is also looking insanely strong.  Transactions are at all time highs, hash rate is continuing to skyrocket, mining pool distribution is good, LocalBitcoins volume is at ATHs every fortnight.
News in the community is also very positive.  Winklevoss COIN ETF looks close, SegWit and/or a block size increase are increasingly likely. Honestly no-one cares what Circle does, Jeremy Allaire never really "got" Bitcoin anyway he was just in it to make a fast buck.
Meanwhile, the rest of the world's fiat currency continues to fail.  Venezuela is a basket case, Italy is shaky, Britain is supposed to ditch the EU and cause shocks in the Euro at some point.
All that's missing is some media hype to light the rope.  With one more decent leg up, Bitcoin passes USD$1000 and gets a bunch of free press and past $1200 it hits ATHs and the price of gold per ounce and goes ballistic.
Bitcoin is bubbling at the "pre-bubble explosion" stage of its price cycle, and all the other factors are coming into alignment. This also coincides with the optimism of users phase of the cycle, since all the veterans can see this happening from experience and the newer users are mostly positive on their Bitcoin investment because all the unfaithful who bought at the top in the last bubble have long since sold out.
Make sense?

That's a question of linguistics, which is notoriously inconsistent.  "I'm having a baby next month, I'm expecting a boy" is correct, and that's also a case where the outcome is known pretty much for sure and isn't likely to vary.
In this case, I would definitely put Bitcoin's cap in the category of "expected", even if only because hitting the coin cap is more than a hundred years away.  It's not even possible to say Bitcoin will still  exist at that time, let alone what the network parameters will be, so expected is about the highest level of certainty I think it's fair to claim.

By "corrected" you mean called a moron, idiot or dumbass instead of disputed on the actual argument?
My position is this:
- Bitcoin is trusted because it has the longest chain with the most proof-of-work. This stands in place of a third party to prevent double spending.
- Having thousands of transaction validating nodes, exchanges, users, developers or anything else is less important to trust in the network than having the most proof of work. A chain with 2 exchanges and 80% of the mining power is far, far superior to one with 15 exchanges and 20% of the mining power - the latter can be double spent and defrauded any time by the former.
The fact that either of these two statements is controversial makes me seriously worried for the future of Bitcoin.  If doesn't even understand how and why Bitcoin works, I don't know how the rest of the world is going to.

Yes, nodes will reject these new blocks.
The miners then start a new network and create a couple of new nodes that agree with them. The old nodes stuck rejecting "invalid transactions" become irrelevant, because there is no proof of work backing up the transactions they DO think is valid so the coins in them are worthless.


Exactly, and the clients on the long chain with "invalid" transactions will rapidly switch to become the "valid" clients while the ones on the original chain become worthless since their coins have no security.


It's not impossible to have a hard for, it just finishes very quickly.  Everyone rapidly converges back to the most hashing power.  That's proven by the history of Bitcoin, which has no hard forks lasting more than a few hours.

Actually it does matter, because...


You realise what we call "miners", are called "nodes" in the whitepaper right? Search "miner" in the whitepaper, the only time it comes up is in reference to gold mining.  And Satoshi definitely didn't write a whitepaper without describing even once the people that do the Bitcoin mining.
Originally, nodes and miners were one and the same - you ran the one and only Bitcoin client on your computer and it mined and verified transactions.  All nodes were miners and all miners were nodes. It was only later that the two became distinct with the introduction of specialised mining rigs and the the ability to run validation software without simultaneously mining.
When you read the whitepaper, you should replace "nodes" in your head with "miners".
This is obviously a piece of Bitcoin history you are too new to be aware of.

Demand is demand, Bitcoin's price (and therefore liquidity and therefore utility) doesn't care if you want to buy to smoke weed through paper wallets or to make money.
So yes, even when the demand has nothing to do with practicality.

It's only a problem for means of exchange in the short term, because if everyone wants to hold Bitcoin and wants to get rid of their fiat, eventually the fiat becomes worthless (since no one wants to hold it, just get rid of it ASAP) and everyone starts demanding Bitcoin aka Gresham's law.

I never mentioned your transactions or sought to compare yours to mine. It was only you that decided because mine didn't sound exactly like yours that it couldn't have possibly happened, which is a ludicrously idiotic assumption.
The reality is that Bitcoin transactions are often, in fact probably more often than not, going to have multiple inputs. I've been making Bitcoin transactions and introducing people to Bitcoin for years and I can guarantee you from substantial personal experience that block space shouldn't be as expensive as it is now if we want Bitcoin to grow to its potential in the consumer payments area or for any kind of casual use case (which we should).
The source of my problem is not that I have multiple inputs, it's that I actually want to use Bitcoin but the network is doing well and *succeeding* without being given room to grow.  An increase to 2MB block size might kill off some nodes, it might not, we won't know until we try.  What it definitely won't do is kill the entirety of Bitcoin but it definitely will restore the possibility for casual Bitcoin use.
@_date: 2016-12-20 01:56:06
So anyone who changes the code makes it not Bitcoin?  So every update since Satoshi's initial release is "not Bitcoin"?
Miners alone are sufficient.  You still haven't addressed my scenario.
If I have 80% of the hash rate and you have 20% of the hash rate, you can have everything else.  You can have 99% of the users, 99% of the developers, 99% of the exchanges, 99% of everything.
I double spend on your network until it becomes worthless.  You can't do anything to my network in retaliation except join it, making it the valid and worthwhile Bitcoin chain.

There is a decent sized risk, however it's certainly not enormous.
The rate of change in the Bitcoin protocol is constantly slowing down, exactly BECAUSE of the need to maintain compatibility with things like hardware wallets.
I wouldn't assume you could bury a hardware wallet and 50 years later it would be fine, although in reality the chances are probably better than even that it would be.
As Bitcoin is still very early in its development, it's a very very good idea to keep an eye on it every once in a while in case there are any major changes.

In reality, they converge to the same thing.  And yes, miners follow value, in reality.
In theory, if there was a split with miners on one fork and everyone else on the other, miners are on "the real Bitcoin" because they have the longest proof of work chain. In reality, they then join the chain everyone else is on, but until they do, they are "the real Bitcoin".

Yes, [especially Litecoin](
Also, this [follow up explanation of why altcoins generally suck](  They are of course useful as tiny experiments for features to add to Bitcoin or with some small market cap so that if people want to use anonymity that isn't in Bitcoin yet they can quickly trade in, through and out of a relevant coin.  But no altcoin should ever be considered as a serious competitor with or replacement for Bitcoin - borne out by history where Bitcoin has never been less than 80% of the entire crypto market cap.

Roger Ver is literally one of the world's largest holders of Bitcoin.  He has **hundreds of thousands**, worth millions in fiat already and enough to make him one of the 0.000001% if Bitcoin succeeds.

@_date: 2016-12-20 03:43:20
Not that everyone has to use it, but everyone eventually will.  A cryptocurrency with no security is pointless, and if another network is bigger it will kill off the smaller one.
Litecoin has a different hashing algorithm, as do 99% of altcoins.  That's what makes them distinct from Bitcoin, because their proof of work is different, so it's not possible to even compare which "has more hash power".
You'll notice there is no competitor to Bitcoin with even .1% of its market cap with the same hashing algorithm.
@_date: 2016-12-23 18:56:17
So your position is that raising the block size is bad, but lowering it back to the current value is also bad (implying that, the current value is bad).
Do you support SMALLER blocks? Do you even use Bitcoin?  I was loving this rally until my transaction cost 36 cents (already way too high) and still took 10+ blocks to get a single confirmation.  The reality is that Bitcoin's growth is being restricted by the block size cap, who knows how many potential new users (aka increase decentralisation) we are missing out on as a result.

Yes they can, OP is wrong.
His shitty logic is "If someone hard forks Bitcoin in a way I don't like, it's not Bitcoin, it's an altcoin."
But that's not true.  The only objective definition of Bitcoin is the coin with the most hashing power, not whichever fork OP (or Satoshi, or me, or anyone else) prefers.  This will be influenced by market forces, so the ultimate arbiter of the network rules are all Bitcoin holders (can sell on one chain and buy on another, and mining hardware will follow for profit).
Saying "I don't like this hard fork, so it's not Bitcoin" is just acting like a two year old stamping his foot on the ground, it doesn't change the reality that the fork with more hashing power IS BITCOIN (by definition). 
@_date: 2016-12-26 17:30:21
Yes, but it would be horribly insecure and chances are really, really high that all your Bitcoins would get stolen.
Humans are notoriously bad at generating "random" information, and Bitcoin's security relies entirely on randomness.  A lot of people are known to run algorithms that constantly check for people using seed words they have generated themselves and when they find one stealing all the Bitcoin.
TL:DR; It's technically possible but don't do it.

If you mean people who control the hashing power in pools, then that's a question of the hash rate *distribution*, not the hash rate *volume* which is what you were analogising to with your $1 lock example.  Distribution is a separate issue from hash rate volume.


If it became apparent that the government was embarking on some year+ length plan to manufacture thousands of mining rigs, there would be time to change Bitcoin sufficiently to prevent the efficacy of such an attack.  For instance, Bitcoin could migrate en masse to a new hashing algorithm.  This wouldn't be ideal, but it could be done if faced with an existential threat.


[This very outdated video, from 2014, found the price of an attack to be at least $20 million](  Since then, hash rate has gone up in orders of magnitude.
By the time an attack could be prepared (at least a year or two), it will have gone up ANOTHER order of magnitude or more.
I am really not worried that any bank or government is going to burn hundreds of millions or billions of dollars to MAYBE screw around with Bitcoin anytime in the next couple of years. Bitcoin is still barely a blip in terms of its transactional capacity, but nevertheless a gargantuan task to take down.
By the time it was even worth **considering** an attack (much less preparing, much less executing), Bitcoin will have become entrenched too heavily in society to be attackable.
You lose sleep over the US government developing a spontaneous ability to coordinate for the purpose of spending billions on Bitcoin mining chips, a technology 99% of people still don't care one bit about, I won't.

Bitcoin absolutely should try and compete with Paypal, hell it should try and compete with the US dollar and if it can't even manage Paypal then that's a real, real shame.
An increase to 2mb would lower fees and increase the growth in new users and POS physical merchant services, which in term provides extra brand recognition for Bitcoin.
It's not going to make global micropayments instantly viable, nor does it have to, and eventually other solutions IN ADDITION TO on-chain scaling can be implemented to reach that. There's been nothing except "maybe we'll scale on-chain someday, but definitely not now" excuses for years by people who propose only alternative methods.
What it would do is provide Bitcoin some breathing room to grow for the next 12 months, giving more time for discussion/development of other solutions AND providing some actual data on how much and in what ways a block size raise impacts upon the rest of the economy to inform future decisions in this area.  Maybe an increase for higher MB blocks would be a good idea after this, maybe not, I don't know but I'd sure like to actually have some real world data to consider instead of constant "thin end of the wedge" but data-less fear mongering. 
It's hardly "shilling" to suggest we try raising the block size ONCE when it is evidently needed right now, will give us actual data to consider the effects of on-chain scaling and definitely will not melt down the network.
Maybe it will be a disaster and I'll become strongly opposed to future increases.  Maybe it will be a resounding success and 3MB in 2019 doesn't seem out of the question.  Maybe neither. The point is WE DON'T KNOW, and instead are left with the guarantee that network growth is being restricted despite a small increase being clearly tenable (not to mention reversible if necessary) until obstinate users like yourself stop acting like putting a toe in the water to check the temperature is equivalent to diving off a 10 metre into a pool of boiling lava.
It's been this much of a struggle to get a single increase from 1MB to 2MB, and yet you're worried that it's going to somehow rapidly snowball consensus to 16MB or more as users that are just as motivated as you to protect Bitcoin recklessly drive it off a cliff.  Ludicrous.

None of them are Bitcoin, until one somehow gets a slight edge which snowballs into the longest proof of work chain.  This is guaranteed to happen (and fairly quick, in less than a couple of days) for two reasons:
1. Block generation is random, not predictable.  So even just by chance one chain will find more blocks than the other two in the short term - thus becoming the real Bitcoin.
2. In reality, the Bitcoin ecosystem (exchanges, merchants etc.) needs to agree. Everyone benefits from cooperation, no one from continued division. Therefore everyone will switch as quickly as possible to whichever chain looks like it's going to come out on top.  Something will happen to give one chain an edge (for instance, all the developers publish a press release saying "we're going with Chain X") and that will almost instantly become the chain everyone sticks with.

The extra "," before respectively seems out of place and should probably be removed. My principle is that a sentence should still make sense after removing a section in between commas.  
"two novel concepts called the mempool demand curve and the block space supply curve respectively." seems very odd, so I feel the second "," in the original quote should be removed.


You've used "versus" a bunch of times throughout the piece, and I'd strongly recommend changing them to alternatives like "when compared to".  The general rule is that "versus" is appropriate for the title of legal cases and sports matches in the form "A versus B", and that's about it.


Not necessarily a problem here, but the use of e.g. with or without a comma depends on whether you prefer American or British English.  If the latter, this is a "mistake" (x2 because it appears later in the paper as well).


Shouldn't this be "a miner's individual hash rate" or "any given miner's individual hash rate"?  Seems odd to have this phrase with a possessive ' mark but no article (i.e. "a") on a non-proper noun.
This applies to most of the other constants too, for example "the total hash rate of Bitcoin network" instead of "total hash rate of Bitcoin network".
I'm not super flash on scientific convention so I might be wrong, but as a casual reader this seems strange.


All of the equations above and below this have no colon or full stop ending the sentence, so seems like either they should all have a colon/full stop or none.  Since this is the odd one out, I've picked this as the "mistake".


Now we're back to using a colon.


Shouldn't this be "The *mempool* is the name given ..."?  It was referred to with the article "the" both in the title immediately above and at the end of the preceding paragraph.  It reads better and is more consistent.


Same as "e.g.," above.


"the transactions in the mempool".  Missing a "the" here too, both for consistency and because there is only one mempool being discussed at this specific moment.




We're back to introducing some equations with a colon and some without.

We're just going to have to agree to disagree.
In my view, the chances of a 25% minority of hashing power having massive economic support is so close to 0 as to not matter.
Not to mention that any change with a 75% majority should be expected to become unanimous probably within hours at the very latest, since its blockchain will be growing 3x as fast and everyone on the smaller chain can see their bitcoin's expected future value and legitimacy draining to zero at an increasingly rapid rate the whole time.
Same reason there's only been 1 fork in the history of Bitcoin &gt; 10 blocks (afaik) and it was due to a technical bug rather than an economic or policy disagreement.

How do you figure?  This is such a non-sequitur.  Why would "XT Bitcoins" be worth any less than "Core Bitcoins", if the XT fork got its supermajority?
If the XT fork set in with a 75% share of the hash rate and someone mined a 1.1mb+ block, then actually "XT bitcoins" would still be worth 100% (because they'd now be bitcoins) and "Core bitcoins" would be worth 0% (because they'd then be "that obsolete fork with less hash power and an irrelevant shorter blockchain coins").

It's really more the case that Bitcoin tends to face one super important issue at any one time than a bunch of small ones simultaneously.
Bitcoin takes the small stuff in stride.  The big stuff is where decentralisation and awareness is critical.
I don't mind it, it gives me confidence in Bitcoin that after things calm down the Blockchain is still processing transactions.
@_date: 2015-08-10 10:01:00
Note (disclaimer: not an expert) that Bitcoin XT is not programmed to make any different a blockchain than Bitcoin Core (afaik), unless and until it's at a supermajority and then the only difference will be allowing blocks bigger than 20MB.
So running extra nodes in any ratio of Core/XT will still benefit the strength of the network and blockchain health, whether or not XT ends up reaching a supermajority and raising the block size limit.

You say that as if that isn't the entire basis of Bitcoin's consensus system.
The debate doesn't matter, just what software ("law") is running on a majority of miners/nodes.  And the way the "law" changes is by some of the miners/nodes running different software, or "trying to force the bill into law".
There is not a requirement that everyone agree on before the Bitcoin network can change its rules.  If anything, it's closer to the other way around.  The Bitcoin network changes its rules, and then everyone on has to acknowledge that that's the way the network is going to be run.
Its *most* like:
1. People disagree on 2. The Bitcoin network either changes or it doesn't as a result of the "law" chosen by a majority miners/nodes
3. People still disagree on but most of the ones who were wrong have to shut up

That wouldn't work for a different reason, which is that it could conceivably get mass miner adoption but the coin would fail as all of the investors in Bitcoin (aka the common users) would think "This is bullshit, why are the miners just giving themselves more coin for no good reason, I didn't buy into this" and immediately sell all of their Bitcoin and crash the price to 0.
See this article for more expansion on this idea:  
The miners' interests individually are kept in check by each other, and the miners' interests as a group are kept in check by the users.  This is the ingenious system of Bitcoin incentives.

.... uhhhh it's about both.  Consensus comes **from** a majority vote, with the minority left to very rapidly come into line at their own peril.


Not true at all.  Yes, things need to be kept in perfect bit-exact agreement in the blockchain, but that doesn't mean votes by majority on changes can't be implemented through block version numbers.
This means that both a majority vote can be held on an issue, while the block size stays in bit-perfect agreement both before, during and after the vote (no matter the outcome).
At no stage, whether there is a vote or not, will Bitcoin get progressively diverging transaction histories.  If things vary even a little bit, the fork is rapidly resolved since the obvious losers don't want to be even a little bit out of line and there's no opportunity for "progressive divergence".

It's also a nascent product *that's past success came from the promise it could evolve when required*.
Any kind of "I can't believe we're risking Bitcoin's future on this change" opinions don't get it.
If Bitcoin can't deliver on an ability to be forked and reach consensus again, then it's better it die now.  Bitcoin was invented to be both radical and evolutionary, and anyone wanting to direct Bitcoin conservatively because of the risks of evolution should go check out the MasterCard API.

I don't think you understand hard forks.
If the miners get to 75% XT, then that's it, the hard fork already happened and it's over.
Users have nothing to do with a hard fork, at least all of the ones who don't mine or run a full node, which is 99.9% of them and who I assume you are referring to.
For the vast majority of users, who rely on SPV (including mobile) wallets, web wallets etc., there will be zero changes whether or not XT causes a change.  If XT had 75% of the mining power, you'd better believe all the web providers etc. would follow that change faster than you can blink.  And since the change is in the size of blocks, which SPV wallets don't check or care about, they wouldn't need to do anything either but just keep accepting blocks from the longest blockchain (which would be... the XT blockchain).
Users have nothing to do with a hard fork, at least not technically.  Users can affect a hard fork economically by selling on one side and buying on the other, which remains the apocalyptic decider if for some incredible reason the majority of miners wanted to do something with Bitcoin that the economic majority of users didn't. The block size is not going to be one of those cases, since the economic majority of users overwhelmingly don't care if blocks are 1MB or 20MB as long as everything still works fine either way, which for the time being it will.
If XT gets a supermajority, there will be a hard fork and probably most users won't even know it happened.

Depends on what you know about the transaction, do you know the address or you want to look for a specific amount of Bitcoin being transferred or what?
If you know the transaction ID, takes about 2 seconds.
Use the search bar at the top:
If something else (transaction size, USD value or whatever else), then I'm sure there's a web based service where you can search the blockchain by various filters but you'd need to be more specific if the ones above don't cut it.

You obviously understand that originally blogs weren't a competitor to newspapers, they were a different product that grew over time to eventually replace a fair chunk of what newspapers did.
So I am incredulous that you somehow think this exact same process couldn't possibly happen with Open Bazaar and Ebay, because of how both products are *right now*.

an XT fork with 75% of the mining power and 5% of the nodes would seriously outmuscle a Core fork with 25% of the mining power and 95% of the nodes.
Mining is so, so, so, so much more important than nodes that nodes barely matter unless it was almost literally 100% of the nodes on the fork with less mining.
Security is paramount, and miners are not going to stick around on the Core fork no matter how many nodes it has if they can see the XT fork is the one that is going to grow the fastest and preserve the value of its bitcoins.

I wouldn't believe them, and nor would anyone with half a brain.


In that case, you'll be left to argue hypotheticals on with everyone else idiotic enough to stay a part of a currency where the miners sneak in little side payments to themselves every once in a while.  You can ask the very poor people still around about what happens then.


Not with 0 miners you can't.  We've been over this...


and if your response is "aha, but someone will start mining on the chain that users actually want! And then some of the rogue miners will start switching back!" then that's exactly my point, that the users keep the collective interests on the miners in check so they can't give themselves 10 bitcoins apiece.


I do too, but they won't need to. That's literally what I said above, they COULD but they wouldn't even need to.  Winning the mining support in a snowball from 51%+ would decide the issue before it even got to that.


Ok, I've had enough of this discussion, seems like it's going to go on forever since you still don't understand the system of incentives protecting Bitcoin.  I suggest you read over our discussion a few times if you have any further questions, everything can be answered by understanding these very simple points:
* If one miner tries to act out, the other miners keep them in line
* If all the miners try to act out, the users keep them in line
* Bitcoin can hard fork to XT with a consensus of the majority of miners and minority of the users, voted on by block size version numbers.  At no point do separate block chains even need to come into the picture, but if it did it would be likely messy, short, and the majority miners+minority users would come out on top of the minority miners+majority users.

You're assuming Bitcoin's ease of use is a constant for the rest of eternity, when it has been and will only get easier.

Yes.  But unlike a block size increase this will never, ever, ever, happen, because why the hell would 95% of miners want to completely crash the value of the system they have invested millions of non-reusable hardware in and maybe even their own Bitcoin by removing possibly the most fundamental thing supporting bitcoin's market value, which is its limited supply? 
I will willingly take an escrowed bet with you that a proposal to allow for more than 21 million bitcoins would never get more than even 5% of hash rate mining support.  Of course I couldn't win the bet if the timeframe was never, so we'd have to make it a ten year timeframe or something instead.

Nodes only need to relay and validate transactions.  Miners sink money into proof of work securing the system and disincentivizing cheating.
You only strictly **need** a bare skeleton of nodes to relay transactions around the network to everyone.  You can't get away with that with miners, because if you have a bare skeleton of miners then the blockchain isn't secure and its value collapses under double spend attempts, takeover by larger mining pools from another chain, lack of consumer confidence etc.
I imagine the outmuscling would work how it would in any situation where one mining network is 3 times the size of the other.  The bigger network will have a more secure blockchain that grows faster, it will thus have the majority of user confidence and investment (plus greater infrastructure support by exchanges, payment processors etc. that rely just as much on transaction security).
Miners on the shorter chain will quickly realise their chain is doomed, and switch over.  This is a compounding snowball effect - which really starts at one chain at 51% rather than 75% (so the whole premise of a 75% chain vs a 25% chain as a stable starting point is already flawed, but I'm willing to overlook that for this hypothetical example) - and so the miners on the small chain all jump over to the larger chain.
Now any nodes that are left on the small network discover they have 0% of hashing power, and either turn off or convert to the winning network.
If needed (which it wouldn't), the 75% network could even spend 30% (of the total hash power, so a little less than half of the 75% on the main chain) on destroying the 25% chain by continuous 51% attack (with the other 45% still more than secure).  It's obvious that the supermajority of mining is going to come out on top, and quickly.
Edit: the numbers in the last section are a bit confusing, but you get the idea.  2/5ths of the large network is still bigger than the entirety of the small network (which is 1/3rd the size of the large network), so the large network can kill the small network by 51% attack and still be totally safe.
@_date: 2015-08-10 12:51:03
It's not guesswork at all.  The line is 51% (or rather, approximately 50.000000001%), since miners will always tend to prefer the most powerful chain aka the one with the majority of the hash rate. This is of course a self-fulfilling prophecy.


You've picked a completely ridiculous example, which is of course easily explained.
No, of course miner's won't jump on a chain programmed in someone else's interests at their own expense, like giving another miner a million coins.
Miners all like a chain which benefits them individually.  However they prefer a chain that treats everyone equally, over one that benefits another miner at their expense.  It's obvious therefore that the chain that treats everyone equally wins out, since it's the 2nd best option for everyone rather than the 1st best option for one miner and the 3rd best option for all the rest.
This ridiculous hypothetical about a miner giving themselves a million coins has no bearing on actual discussion about plausible hard forks, like one over the block size, where it is not clear what is in each miner's best interests.

Yes if it is harder to use and requires more work to use than* existing systems.


Or has nothing ever been used that is cheaper (alternatively: 'more powerful', 'less restrictive') but slightly less convenient than existing solutions? For some people, the extra effort is worth the cost savings, which drives innovation and a market on the less convenient option, which gradually becomes better to be both the cheaper AND more convenient option.

... but why would US consumers use a foreign service then?
Due to convenience, cultural trust and other things people tend to prefer local vendors over foreign vendors where there is no substantial difference on price, quality or regulation.
If US companies are BitLicensed, then perhaps more people will look to foreign companies.
If the foreign company is also BitLicensed, they definitely will not get any US customers since their competition will be US companies with it (more ~~convenient~~ trustworthy?) and or foreign companies without it (less regulation).
Hate to break it to you OP, but you are not a world leading espionage innovator.  Requiring your foreign company to collect US consumer information just means you won't have any US consumers signing up, not that the existing pool of US consumer information owned by US companies suddenly becomes available to you.

This is probably what people want to hear, but isn't true at all.  Banks will eventually need Bitcoin, but Bitcoin has got to where it is without banks. While they'll eventually become involved due to their own self-interest, the longer they don't get heavily involved the more the Bitcoin world will develop bank-independent solutions.  Silk Road is the classic example of this, and looks like Open Bazaar is going to take it a step further.
We are trying to replace the current banking system and government.

I agree that licensing and so forth raises the cost of the business, but that's an issue with government not Paypal.
Those costs apply to everyone, not just to Paypal, and it's definitely not Paypal's fault that they are complying and paying the associated costs.  This makes it very disingenuous to say Paypal are a "thieving bag of scumbags" when they're actually the ones doing the best job of navigating the web of licensing requirements globally.

This is no reason to exclude them from the discussion. Someone who works for Blockstream and plans to profit from very expensive block space is equally "biased" just in the other direction.
If you take out everyone who actually has an interest in the outcome for "bias" (note also these people are regularly the most knowledgeabout about the process BECAUSE they have an interest), then the decision is made by a lot of people who don't actually care or know anything about it.
This is the exact opposite of optimal. We should want everyone with strong interests to get as much input as possible, so that Bitcoin compromises most efficiently between all of its supporters.

The ability to extrapolate apparently only comes to them when it's applicable to a downwards price trend.
Meanwhile, Bitcoin is well up from the $4 value it was at when Buttcoin was started, and doing more than 100 000 transactions every day.  I'll wait for the explanation about how all of that is spam, and always has been spam, and always will be spam.

China stocks suffered their sharpest daily percentage decline since 2007, as worries mount that authorities are pulling back on measures to prop up the market.
The Shanghai Composite Index SHCOMP, -8.48%  ended down 8.5% at 3,725.56, its second-straight day of losses and worst daily percentage fall since February 27, 2007. China’s main index is up 6% from its recent low on July 8, but still off 28% from its high in June.
The smaller Shenzhen Composite 399106, -7.00%  fell 7% to 2,160.09 and the small-cap ChiNext 399006, -7.40%  closed 7.4% lower at 2,683.45.
Analysts say the selling came as investors fear the government is curbing its buying of blue-chip stocks—and could even be testing whether the market can support itself.
“The previous support from the government funds is apparently unsustainable,” said Fu Xuejun, a strategist at Huarong Securities. “They may withdraw support today to test whether the market has recovered its resilience. The government wants to use state funds to stabilize the market, not to prop it back to 5,000 point overnight.”
Earlier this month, 21 brokerages pledged to support the Shanghai index as long as it stayed below the 4,500 level. Before Monday, China’s main stock market had rallied for three-straight weeks.
Local brokerages estimate that a state-owned fund called China Securities Financial Corp. has spent hundreds of billions of yuan in supporting the market, although authorities haven’t disclosed a total figure.
Monday’s swift fall came as a surprise to many analysts, prompting speculation that officials might step in with fresh rescue measures.
“I am positive that we will see state support emerging again in the next two days,” said Zhang.
Meanwhile, turnover on the A-share market has hovered about 1.2 trillion yuan in recent days, compared with more than 2 trillion yuan before the market slump, according to Qian Qimin from Shenyin Wanguo Securities.
“It means that investors are still uncertain about the impact of any potential policy changes,” Qian added.
“The soft industrial figure number [is adding] downward pressure” said Gerry Alfonso, director of trading at Shenwan Hongyuan Securities. Earlier, data showed industrial profits in China falling 0.3% in June from a year ago, after rising the previous two months. 
Elsewhere, other Asian markets declined more modestly, pressured by disappointing earnings results overseas.
The Hang Seng Index HSI, -3.09%  fell 2.7%. Australia’s S&amp;P ASX 200 XJO, +0.43%  was down 0.2%, the Nikkei Stock Average NIK, -0.95%  fell 1%, and South Korea’s Kospi SEU, -0.35%  was off 0.4%.
“Investors are on watch for earnings revisions, but are bracing for negativity, after so many high-profile U.S. companies have disappointed with either missed performance numbers or weak forecasts,” said Hideyuki Ishiguro, a strategist at Okasan Securities.
Commodity prices had remained under pressure heading into the weekend, with copper sinking to a six-year low, gold falling to a five-year low, and U.S. oil prices pushing further below $50 a barrel.
Asian currencies continued to feel the pressure of a strong U.S. dollar amid expectations for U.S. interest rates to rise later this year, with some hitting fresh multi-year lows.
The Malaysian ringgit MYRUSD, -0.0183%  hit as high as 3.8140 against the U.S. dollar, the highest since the currency was pegged in 2007. It was last at 3.8130. The Philippine peso PHPUSD, -0.083456%  fell to its lowest in five years — it traded as high as 45.560 against the U.S. dollar and was last as 45.530, from 45.50 Friday.
The Indonesia rupiah IDRUSD, -0.29640616%  weakened amid mounting criticism that Indonesia President Joko Widodo has been slow in implementing reforms and disbursing planned government expenditure to boost the economy. On Monday, the rupiah hit as high as 13,460 against the U.S. dollar from its Friday close of 13,440. The South Korean won KRWUSD, +0.174611%  fell to a fresh three-year low against the U.S. dollar. It traded as high as 1,173.60 against the U.S. dollar, from its Friday close of 1,167.35.
In Hong Kong, brokerage house Central China Securities 1375, -8.48%   is raising 2.53 billion Hong Kong dollars ($326 million) via a share placement in a bid to expand its businesses. The firm said Sunday it has agreed to sell 592.12 million new shares at HK$4.28 each to independent investors, representing about 18.4% of its enlarged share capital. Shares slid 11%.
Some 75% of the net proceeds are expected to expand the firm’s margin financing and securities lending business, with the rest to be used for other investment and to supplement its liquidity. Margin debt was a key factor underpinning the strength of the China rally until mid-June, as well as exasperating the market’s decline thereafter.

Reason 1: Bitcoin has exploded with growth (indicated by price, transaction numbers etc.) over the last five years.

The long and short of Myclelium is that it's:
* Open source
* Developed by an awesome company that is constantly posting updates to the community here in (see * Tends to be on the cutting edge of the latest, useful features (eg. HD wallets, multiple accounts, Mycelium Local Trader, spending from cold storage)
* Is well tested, widely used and thus less likely to have unexpected bugs or security issues
* Makes back ups relatively simple, which is a major sticking point / security / loss risk for new users
* At least for me that interface is pretty common sense, everything works exactly how you'd expect. I really like the way you get a fiat currency equivalent next to your prices, and you can set the currency to reference
The benefits over Coinbase, Circle etc. is that you're storing the keys locally on your phone.  Coinbase has some options where you control part of the keys (and can recover if something goes wrong), Circle doesn't afaik but either way you're involving an extra third party operator which goes against the principles of decentralisation and peer to peer exchange that Bitcoin is built on.
Cold storage options like the Trezor or paper wallets are also fantastic, but are impractical for everyday use i.e. "spending cash".
Honestly if you want to get involved in Bitcoin, I recommend you jump in.  Don't put in $100 000 until you're a bit more experienced obviously, but reading a thousand different lists of features for each wallet is still not going to be as helpful as just downloading the top 5 recommended Bitcoin wallets for your platform, buying $5 of Bitcoin to mess around with, and giving each of them a try.

Contrary to popular misconception, Bitcoin is blessed rather than cursed by volatility.
To go a step further, it is Bitcoin's unstable foreign exchange rate which gives it the massive assets of free capital movement (absence of capital controls) and an independent monetary policy.

I'm a developer and I might pay $400 to plug straight into Bitcoin and get cracking instead of spending hours and hours mucking around with the core protocol just to get up to speed.  I could do it by "jumping the hurdles", but the cost of that in terms of time and frustration is very likely higher than $400.
I say that as someone with 2 years of continuous interest in and experience with Bitcoin (mostly non-technical though).  99% of developers have none of that background knowledge, so getting to the good stuff is an even better prospect.
Also, what is $400 today will be $100 next year.

You say that with such a derogatory tone, when it's actually a massive improvement.
In the current situation, *any songs/videos/websites that would require micropayments simply don't exist*.  In other words, you currently listen to 0 songs, watch 0 minutes of video and view 0 websites.

You click on the Youtube link out of idle curiosity. The video shows some kind of computer graphic involving a pick axe, some numbers scrolling around, flashing gold Bitcoins and some cutesy "success" sound to top it off.
"Fuck buying Bitcoin," you think to yourself, "that shit's expensive, like a couple hundred dollars or something."
The dots instantly connect in your head.
"I already have a computer though, and it's actually a pretty sick gaming rig capable of running some games on medium!"
Your eyes glow as you rush to which you've heard is full of libertarian lunatics but never been interested in before.  In any case, those sound exactly like the kind of guys to get advice from about some new-age Californian gold rush, where anyone can make a fortune with just a spade and hard work.
Although these days the spade is your 2012 MacBook Pro and there's no hard work required because MacBooks are automatic. Perfect.
Already envisioning the Lamborghini you will have parked outside your window in just a few short months, you submit a thread "Hey guys new to Bitcoin need help with mining".
To your dismay, the down votes pour in. After less than 30 seconds, your full proof plan to become a hacker millionaire has encountered a snag. Two kinda snarky replies say "Don't mine, it's not profitable." and "Use the search bar."
Wondering what has got the stick stuck up these guys asses, you are relieved when 30 seconds later you get a slightly more detailed reply.
"Mining takes millions of dollars of hardware these days, it's run in massive factories in China. You'd have to run your computer for millions of years to make a couple of cents worth of Bitcoin. If you want to do it as a hobby, go for it, but if you want Bitcoin you're much better off buying some.  Check out Coinbase." There's a link to a 7 minute video showing some sketchy illegal power plant operation going on in Shenzhen, which is at least enough to convince you that mining was at least a little bit oversimplified in the animation you saw minutes earlier.
Heartbroken, you turn away from the computer screen and go outside to relieve your frustration on your skateboard.
Around six months later, a friend of yours mentions Bitcoin, with grandiose plans to become a Bitcoin miner.  As you fumble through trying to explain why he's an idiot, you realise you really don't know much about Bitcoin either. You come back to read the linked post at the top of the page, read the entire sidebar, follow for several months and fail your university mid semesters because your only preparation was Andreas Antonopolous videos.
Feeling confident, you wonder what's going on in the "new" tab.
Of the top 5 posts, three of them start with "Hey so I'm new to Bitcoin and need info about mining".  You enthusiastically jump in to correct their mistakes and spread the love of Bitcoin.
6 months and 853 mining explanations later, and you don't bother posting in /new anymore. If you're feeling charitable but irascible, you'll drop by to dispense "Use the search bar". Memories of that Lamborghini have faded entirely from your mind.
TL:DR; People aren't unsupportive of mining, it's just that we know (because we were that guy) that 99.9% of the time it's some kid who thinks they can get insta-rich because they watched one introductory Bitcoin graphic.  People with the money and knowledge to mine seriously, don't post in asking about it.

There's five people with commit access to the Bitcoin core repository.  Gavin and four of the other main contributors, not sure which ones (someone?).
They only commit things which have are uncontroversial or have a significant majority of consensus from the discussion on the github/mailing list.
These changes are only rolled out to the network if a majority of miners/nodes/service providers/end users upgrade.
If there were ever any shenanigans with the Github account, the alarm would go out immediately and everyone would actively ignore upgrades while what happened was investigated, which wouldn't take long since it's a public repository. Perhaps this would involve starting more distribution points for the core code, perhaps it wouldn't. It's never happened (afaik) and isn't likely to anyway.
If you are concerned about development centralisation, I highly suggest learning to code and writing your own implementation of the Bitcoin protocol. Gavin has mentioned ongoing modularisation of the existing code (extracting consensus rules into an isolated unit being a key part) to make your task easier for you.
TL:DR; There's 5 people who control the github. This is not a "it's centralised, kill it with fire" situation. Bitcoin is still completely lacking in centralised control points, relax.

In a sense, everyone who owns Bitcoin and is willing to sell it for cash is a "decentralised exchange", these things just help aggregate a list of them.

BTC-E is by far the shadiest exchange.  Despite being the most reliable over the longest period of time, the underground Eastern European mob that seem to be running the show don't inspire confidence. If anyone was going to pull the plug and disappear with the coins, it'd be them. Thus less people trade on their exchange.
More importantly, getting fiat in/out of BTC-E is RIDICULOUSLY expensive/slow/sketchy/difficult. A lot of Russian transfer systems that charge 10% plus money on currency conversion. Maybe my stats are out of date, because it's been a long time since I used BTC-E, but suffice to say putting fiat in is difficult, and getting it out is almost impossible, and would be horrendously expensive.
Thus the constantly lower price.


Nothing.  Except the difficulties with fiat transfer described above make it only so-profitable, and that difference seems to be about the $5 or so that BTC-E lags behind.

Stopped reading right here.
How can anything get consensus, if no-one's allowed to discuss it?
Consensus on a NEW idea requires a transition where people abandon the old idea and adopt the new one. Bitcoin's adoption is a perfect example of this, people moving from consensus that "Bitcoin is horrible" to "Actually Bitcoin's kinda cool".
Under your definition, the only thing that could ever have consensus is the current state of affairs, which is literally the most anti-innovation and stagnant ideology possible.
If you're not allowed to discuss new ideas until everyone agrees on them, you by definition cannot ever get to any new ideas.  And apparently its better to stick your fingers in your ears and yell "LA LA LA NOT EVERYONE AGREES SO SHUT UP" than be able to have a sensible debate that would facilitate progress.

I don't understand the question.
Your multi bit wallet has connected to the Bitcoin network. There is no other network to connect to, and you did not set it up on any network. There's one Bitcoin network and that's the one you're on.
Unless you're a developer and using test net, which I don't believe you can with Multibit, although maybe I'm wrong. If you were at that stage though, you'd probably be able to figure it out yourself instead of asking here.
If you want to send/receive alt coins, you will need to download a separate wallet for that.

The difference is that the people running 100 ASICS are profitable by economy of scale with regards to electricity costs, rent, time spent managing the miners etc.
1 ASIC might output as much as 1/100th of the 100 ASICS in terms of hash rate, but profitability relies on the proportional cost basis, which would be higher for the former.
As far as I'm aware, it's also very hard to acquire the latest cutting edge equipment unless you are buying in bulk.

You COULD just do this in the first place, but that doesn't mean it's preferable.
I don't understand the apparent mass confusion at the idea of initial user simplicity.  Everyone's always complaining about how Bitcoin is "too hard to use for average joe" and now that it's being made easier everyone's worried that it's "not perfectly cost efficient".  No shit, making something easier to use usually makes it (a little bit) more expensive and surprise, surprise most consumers can tolerate that.
Making it easy to use initially is important because people like it when new stuff is simple as fuck.  They have a much higher threshold for some simple maintenance AFTER their device has been running successfully for a year.  You'd be pissed off if you had to defrag your computer the first time you booted it up, but after two years of owning it you think it's kind of reasonable if you google "speed up my computer" and get some easy advice on how to do so.
Why wouldn't this exact same user preference psychology apply to a Bitcoin mining and powered device?

The merchant plugin method is the way to go, as long as it's coming from a reputable place. A lot of work has gone into helping people like you accept Bitcoin without having to worry about the messy details, so it's definitely something you want to take advantage of. Just do your research (again, Google is your friend or you can ask on Reddit how reputable any of the larger sites are) and make sure to ask a lot of questions.

Everyone needs to stop being so worried about this mysterious bogeyman of "volatility".  If Bitcoin is going to increase, it will have to be volatile, and it needs to gain price/liquidity/attention/legitimacy a LOT more than it needs a few weak hands who are all "I'll buy in when it's stable" (who will by then have changed their tune to "There's no way to profit since it's just flat").


Well while the price has been falling the last 2 years, transactions per day has ALSO been rising.  Speculation is of course a part of it, but it's just the nature of Bitcoin that the growth in infrastructure only shows in the price after we hit the end of a bubble cycle and a new one starts.

This is also a terrible user experience. Even before the fact that multi-output transactions are going to be hard to create and sign for average joe, it assumes that you purchase and begin using all 50 of your devices simultaneously.

@_date: 2015-11-03 11:41:23


No, it isn't.
Think of it this way, if Bitcoin grew 100x faster than it is currently, would it be more or less volatile? Clearly, a LOT more. Higher growth = higher volatility.
And there is no evidence that lower volatility increases growth on an objective measurement like transactions per day, just anecdotal complaints (or more often: second hand accounts of reports of complaints) about "I don't accept Bitcoin because it's too volatile". I would wager good money that in the hypothetical scenario where Bitcoin was locked at a perfectly stable value the vast majority of merchants with that complaint would find some other excuse not to accept Bitcoin (eg. "It's not practical", "No one would even buy anything with it", "It's too heavily associated with drugs" etc. etc.).
The real reason they don't want to accept Bitcoin is because it isn't a compelling use case for them yet, and that's fine, so our task is to make it so by making Bitcoin so popular, simple and profitable that they don't have a choice rather than wasting time on trivial distracting excuses that can't be "fixed" anyway.


Of course, in an ideal world, a closed loop economy with tons of merchants is great.  But we've got to get there somehow, and in all honesty the volatility worries of some non-critical merchants (the kind who want to convert back to fiat in the first place) are small potatoes.
It's much, much, much more important that there is a sizeable monetary and user (aka investor, hodler, speculator whatever you want to call them) base for Bitcoin than that there's a lot of merchants.  If enough people want to pay with Bitcoin, merchants will accept it where as if every merchant wanted to take Bitcoin it would be useless if no-one had any Bitcoin to buy stuff with.
Acquiring that larger monetary and user base is going to take a lot of... you guessed it... volatility.  So volatility really isn't a big problem.
I recommend reading the articles at the Nakamoto Institute for a better idea of how this all works, I thought they were all really good.  Here's some good ones to start on related to this topic of volatility and improvement of the Bitcoin economy:
@_date: 2015-03-04 22:16:10
The initial distribution is not equal, but it is fair.  Everyone has the exact same opportunity to mine/buy coins at every stage in the project's history, it was announced publicly before launch etc.
Sorry buddy, but equality is a pipe dream.  Give a thousand people $100 each, stick them on a desert island, and after two weeks some will be poor and some rich.  Money tracks contribution to an economy, and it is both impossible and undesirable that everyone was exactly equal in contributing and taking the same amount of value from everyone else.
Where Bitcoin is liberating is the removal of government inflation.  No-one wants half of the stuff our government does these days (eg. wars, drug wars, NSA surveillance etc.), but they pay for it anyway by invisibly taxing the population through inflation.
If they can't do that, then they only have two choices.  Option 1 is to cut spending, and if they remove hospitals while keeping the NSA there would be a revolution.  Option 2 is to raise taxes, and if they were raised to the point that would fund hospitals and the NSA there would be a revolution.  Option 3 I suppose is to go broke, which forces us to find a better solution too.
The current get out of jail free card for government is money printing.  And when that's no longer an option, change MUST occur.
New bitcoins won't be distributed forever, and even while they are the money is going to people contributing to the system in proportion to their contribution, rather than to a tiny circle of government cronies and bankers.  This is a massive improvement on the current situation.  Sure, Satoshi has outsized spending power (as does Roger Ver), but they can only spend their Bitcoins once and then they have to earn them back at "market" price.  It's not like they're sitting on a constant faucet that gives them more Bitcoins, and that's the real point.
@_date: 2015-03-25 22:51:58
Definitely do it.
Who should be on the list can be up for debate, but it seems fairly obvious that all of the core devs, Andreas, the Mycelium devs, Coinbase/Bitpay guys etc. should have some sort of flag.
I'd also support a tag for the Nakamoto Institute crowd.
In any case, it would be of great help to new users I'm sure.

Caveat: Don't push it further if they're actually not interested.
Good idea to talk to people.  Good idea to see if they like the sound of it.  Bad idea to force it on people.
Trust me if you have a conversation that goes like this:








Then the next time they have this conversation with **someone else** the answer to the first question will be "Yes". By the fifth person they'll think "Shit, this Bitcoin thing is a big deal" and ask more about it or do some of their own research.
This natural process can be easily wrecked by any one of the five people being a zealous nut bag that won't move on when the other person clearly isn't that keen to find out about it. Although these socially unaware Bitcoiners are actually rather few, Buttcoin has a point to make fun of crusaders evangelising to *people who are not that interested in it yet*.
TL:DR; Talk to people, but don't push it. After encountering enough of these people, whoever you talked to is going to get interested of their own accord and THAT is the time for more detailed discussion.

Here's the key part: I'm very sure that almost any localbitcoins.com seller is also happy to swap cash for Bitcoin privately among their friends and family.

Yes, Bitpay really does do 0% transaction fees. This is why Bitcoin has got a lot of people excited. It's not only really cool and interesting, it's also very practical and inexpensive for online payments.
Another pro tip: If you encourage people to use Bitcoin at your store by offering a discount when paying by Bitcoin (you can split the Paypal margin between you and a Bitcoin owning customer), it will encourage more people to pay with Bitcoin and you will gradually be less and less reliant on Paypal as the expensive middleman.

[Yes it is](  And that's ignoring the fact that someone that is watching of holding Bitcoin probably also discusses with their friends, maybe starts a business or writes some code for it, can buy more in the future etc.

We're discussing trust, not utility.  Bitcoin might have less *utility* (e.g. places to spend it, depending on where you live), but you could still *trust* it as much or more due to other considerations (like the lack of a central authority).
Your distribution of capital depends much more on trust than utility (unless you're almost broke), because presumably the vast majority of your money is savings rather than something you plan to spend in the next week or month.

I'm aware you can use both, but like I said every dollar in Bitcoin is a dollar not in the bank and vice versa.
It's not possible to simultaneously entrust both with all of your money, so you do have to choose between the two as to how much you trust each.  In other words, for every bit you trust one system more, you are of necessity trusting the other less.

The point trying to be made here is that the mining network will readjust its hash rate down to a level where it is profitable.
This *could* be a problem for the rest of us if it meant the network security was problematically low (keep in mind this is a rather unlikely scenario), but in terms of the day to day operation of the network is correct that halvings without a price rise wouldn't be a problem for ordinary users.

You're thinking about this wrong.  If there's two options, A and B that can be used to transact and A is the superior option, people will tend to hoard A and spend B.  This is the "bad money driving out [of circulation] the good".
Thus A will get more and more valuable (because people want to hold on to it) and B will get less and less valuable (because everyone wants to get rid of it).  At some point, people stop accepting B at all, and start demanding A. They don't want B anymore, at any price.  This is "The good money driving out [of any value at all] the bad".
So the end result is that A drives out B by making it worthless, but the process that gets there is B driving A out of circulation.
A usually starts out with less traction but superior qualities (eg. US dollars in Zimbabwe before hyperinflation), and B usually starts out with more traction but inferior qualities (eg. Zimbabwe dollars).
Hence why most people currently use USD, since as a relatively "good" money it has been slowly driving out other local currencies (see dollar hoarding in places like Argentina in preference to the local currency).  But Bitcoin is slowly driving out the USD, as at the edges people are starting to hoard Bitcoin and spend USD.

In my example everyone is starting with B, and A is getting introduced. Sounds like you got them mixed around the other way.


... or the government prints endless amounts of A until it becomes worthless.  Example: Weimar hyperinflation, Zimbabwe hyperinflation.
... or a superior form of money is invented/discovered and starts rapidly spreading through a combination of ideology, superior potential, better monetary policy and unified community.  Example: Bitcoin.


They don't.  In my example "A" was the superior money.  In your example "B" is the one doing the driving out, but also the inferior money.  You're right, this never happens.  The money that is doing the driving out is the superior, initially less accepted one.

Bitpay understands this.  They also pay salaries for one/several core devs, run a bunch of full nodes and advertise directly for Bitcoin (like naming it the St Petersburg Bitcoin Bowl).
This is true for every company in Bitcoin. If the network is unhealthy, their company will suffer, so they're incentivised as a profit-making enterprise in the space to contribute back to the network as a whole (eg. running nodes, open sourcing code, hiring core devs, marketing BTC, perhaps unprofitably mining).  
This is great for everyone: the company, the company employees (who presumably are paid in or hodl Bitcoin), every other company in the Bitcoin space and everyone invested in Bitcoin generally.  It's an upward spiral of productivity and wealth where everyone wins, recently described by Andreas Antonopolous as a "Festival of the commons".


Bitpay might benefit from independent patches, but I think that's pretty minimal, most of the benefit is described above.


A lot of them do as far as I'm aware.  The example that comes to mind is [Coinbase's Open-Source Toshi Node]( [source code]( but I'm sure there are hundreds of others.

Does anyone know where the stats about 7 million Bitcoin users comes from or how it was calculated?
I'd find that hard to believe.  If 14 million people each wanted 1 whole Bitcoin at any price, Bitcoin would be impossible to buy with fiat currency.
I can't believe we're waaaay past half way to that, since many Bitcoin hodlers have more than 1 Bitcoin (some have hundreds of thousands, Satoshi possibly a million) and daily transaction numbers are only around 100 000.  7 million serious Bitcoin holders sounds ridiculous.
Just maybe there are 7 million people who have, at some stage, acquired at least 1 cent worth of Bitcoin - but lots of them would have sold out, forgotten about it, used it all to buy drugs, aren't interested in getting more than the 10 cents their friend gave them to try it out or whatever.  I wouldn't say that's the same as having 7 million "Bitcoin users" though.

Well you do.
You can't have $1 in your bank account at the same time as you can own $1 of Bitcoin.  This is true of every dollar in your bank account.  There's a high opportunity cost of owning Bitcoin and any other currency, so it comes down to a choice of one or the other.
Sure, you can split your total amount in any ratio you want, but how you decide to do that really reflects your proportionate trust in each.

Exactly, game over buddy.  Have you ever taken a large TV out of a store?  It's certainly not a 2 second exercise, probably not even a 10 second exercise...


Yeap, you're going to need a hell of a lot of good luck.  As in astronomically high amounts of it. Are you planning on not even being outside the shop? It's not hard to have an automated double spend alarm sound and the security can grab you at the door.
You say that's unrealistic, but they stop people to check their handbags all the time, it doesn't need to be a mob style shakedown (at least, not initially).


Except that stores aren't stupid, and they will start a register of "known thieves", probably with a photo of your face behind the counter.  It it's a large problem, they will share the information among each other, perhaps collaborating on a shopping mall scale or industry wide scale.  Oh wait, they already do that.
Good luck with your getting arrested while trying to steal TV goals, it sounds like you don't have a very realistic idea of how retail Bitcoin transactions work, how shops prevent thieves or how to execute a double spent. However your confidence will mean you stubbornly ignore everyone trying to help you, so I guess you'll only find out once you're down at the station.

Yes, it doesn't matter.


Bitcoin can be decentralised without having every single user run a full node.
Decentralization operates on a scale, not a black and white.
In fact, [Satoshi even predicted that some degree of centralisation would occur](


Moving on.


I can just feel your fingers itching to add an edit about the circle jerk down voting you, but you really need to re-read the black-or-white fallacy until you understand first, because it's just about every line of your post here.


Yes it will.  The whole point of pruning is reducing the amount of hard drive space to run a (partial) node.  Again, maybe not everyone will be a full node, but that's only an issue at the extreme ends and it's very possible that clever code could make a large consensus of partial nodes as good or better than a small consensus of full nodes, and in reality both would run.

You sound like you're confusing wallets and addresses.
A wallet is software that manages a collection of addresses.  Nothing more, nothing less.  Some (every, afaik) wallet will combine all the Bitcoin stored in each address and give you a running total.
An address holds Bitcoin.  It should just show up in the subtotal displayed in your wallet, but you can double check individual addresses on blockchain.info.

It has all the RECEIVING (public) addresses (or technically, the hashed form of them), yes.
But it doesn't have any of the spending (private) keys.
It's like a locker room with a key hire service.  We know where all the lockers are, and you can see which ones people have put thing into, but the keys are spread out among all the different people who have put things into the lockers, and none of the keys are publicly available.
Sending to an address that no one owns is like locking something into one of the lockers and then melting down the key for it, leaving it locked there forever.  But you might be the only one that knows you have melted down the key, so the locker service can't move your stuff out of the locker because for all they know you're coming back to get it later. And they don't have the key anyway, so they couldn't do anything about it even if they wanted to.

I see it as it can't hurt to have Bitcoin as an option, it's not that hard to set up and will likely take little extra management.
Don't have too high expectations though, Bitcoin is still a niche (but growing) currency and it might be a year or two before you start seeing some significant volume in Bitcoin. You can speed this process up by offering a discount in Bitcoin, prominently advertising that you accept Bitcoin and just by offering Bitcoin and building a reputation among the local Bitcoin community.

If they don't, it gets free publicity and even faster growth at worst or a lot of industry money at best.

I was with you right up until here.
Read this:
The value actually does come from the network of a few hoarders, which is growing into a network of a lot of hoarders.  Just like the USD is valuable because their are a lot of people with their value stored / saved ('hoarded') in USD, and all of them will happily save ('hoard') more in exchange for their goods and services.
The transactions are a result of having hoarders who want to acquire Bitcoin, rather than the hoarders being the result of the possibility of transacting in Bitcoin (otherwise why aren't people hoarding onions, which could also be used to transact?)

I completely disagree.  How long have you been in Bitcoin?  If you've been watching at all the rapid upgrades in speed and professionalisation of Bitpay's POS system over the last year and a half it seems unlikely you'd say it's not getting there fast enough.
On a day to day basis Bitcoin seems to be "taking forever", but on the scale of a year or two Bitcoin is moving at lightning speed.


Having more resources =/= having more resources to dedicate to innovation.
Historically, how much "innovation" has come out of the credit card industry?  They've just clued in to some kind of tap to pay technology, but prior to that I can't think of anything. Although admittedly they might have to start being more innovative, precisely because of competition with Bitcoin.
Not to mention that their high levels of integration and "network effect" work against their ability (in this one case) to rapidly upgrade, since they have to replace a lot of their existing customer hardware, and any software or other problems have far larger repercussions.
It's the small guys that innovate, not the big ones.

So you suggest a primarily internet based idea should spread WITHOUT a visual branding scheme?  It's like you're not even aware that probably &gt;50% of the posts on Reddit are images, or that the Internet's most famous creation is Internet memes (aka recognizable images...)

The floodgates will only ever crack once. Reddit is almost past that point.
Never heard of Bitcoin &gt; misinformed about Bitcoin &gt; informed about Bitcoin &gt; ambivalent about Bitcoin &gt; supporting Bitcoin is a one way transition.
As it is not violent and totally optional, everyone without an underlying emotional issue (such as bitterness at the feeling of missing out, or a pathological need to tear others down to prop up ones own ego) cannot help but arrive at the conclusion that Bitcoin's existence is good competition in a free market for competing services, even if they don't want to use it.
Then all it takes to get another Bitcoiner is any of the following: 
* a dash of curiosity (humans are naturally very curious beings, in fact intelligence highly correlates to curiosity)
* discovery of a practical use case (such as remittances, drug buying, protection of wealth from confiscation or online gambling)
* significant support among local peer group so it becomes normalised to like Bitcoin unless justified by a specific reason, rather than the other way around
* realisation of personal potential for profit, indicated by an ever growing volume of media mentions of Bitcoin and a broader trend to digitisation

The early Internet never had an Internet branding scheme because... there was no Internet (not in the way of memes, high resolution images and massive adoption as we think of it now) to display it on. Duh.
Just because Bitcoin's adoption is somewhat similar to the Internet's adoption, doesn't mean it has to be identical.  You're being very literal about what is merely a conceptual analogy.
In fact, Bitcoin's adoption is progressing much faster than the Internet's - exactly because Bitcoin can and is already leveraging the Internet to its advantage.

Ok: final try.
In times of global economic uncertainty or crisis, "hedge assets" such as gold (and now, Bitcoin) tend to perform well.  Whether it would completely take over (not technically feasible yet, but might be in the future) remains to be seen, but it's unlikely to do poorly in the event of fiat currency issues.  See: Cyprus banking crisis.

This has to be a troll account, but for any observers:
No.  There is 5 people with commit access to the core repository.  They only commit things that already have a general consensus among the developers as being a good idea.
Then each of those changes is only implemented by the network if the majority of miners, the majority of nodes and ultimately the majority of users also decide to upgrade to that version.

It doesn't.  But it does show that Bitcoin isn't turning people away, just the opposite, it's attracting them in droves.
1.  If Bitcoin was turning people away, it wouldn't have caught your attention.  It just would not have been mentioned near you due to everyone being turned away or perceiving it as insignificant and thus having no followers.
2.  If Bitcoin was turning people away, you wouldn't feel threatened by it or upset about it.  This would also mean no need to seek out a community friendly to Bitcoin to attack in order to fruitlessly reassure yourself that it can't/won't continue.

Step 1: Don't base your life decisions on random advice from biased internet strangers.
Step 2: If possible, keep a small amount of your wealth in Bitcoin, as its promise continues to look ever more likely to be realised on a large scale.
Step 3: Do not keep any more in Bitcoin than you can afford to lose.
Step 4: If you need to sell some Bitcoin to eat, do it. This must be a troll post... That said, if you give up one or two small luxuries to hold onto your Bitcoin then I'd keep the Bitcoin.  That's part of why it's exciting, prompting a change in economic habits from mindless consumerism to prudent frugality and investment.

Yes, if that was the one and only thing they spent their money on.  Who needs employee salaries, infrastructure costs, operational costs, other marketing, r&amp;d or anything else at all when you can run one TV ad a bunch of times?
Your trolling is getting consistently poorer in quality.

Never, that's when.
If Bitcoin is going to make it, it needs to be universally useful.

It'd be nice, probably wouldn't hurt, but it's ridiculous to say Bitcoin "needs" coverage from any media outlet.
It's succeeding regardless, and will continue to in the future.

There's nothing contradictory about being opposed to people who oppose Bitcoin, and then accepting them into the fold once they too show support for Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is a very inclusive movement like that.

What everyone knows (that you also know, but won't admit), is that you're just acting stupid to provoke a response and drag people into time wasting Internet debates with an insincere troll.
Either that or you are ridiculously stupid, so trying to explain things to you is also probably a waste of time.

That's a great idea, let's take what is fundamentally a technical product and wholesale ignore all of the knowledge compiled in the habits of all of the world's technical communities and companies.
Of course Bitcoin is a little unusual and economics and so on needs to be considered, but the foundational layer is the code and if that doesn't operate properly then the whole thing will die.
I've never seen such pride in wilful ignorance of key concerns.

And I 100% guarantee you have never worked in computing of any kind, or you'd be familiar with the principle of [software extensibility]( which is basically the exact opposite of this.
It's good practice in software engineering generally to build more before you need it, especially in cases where the change is anticipated to take time. Otherwise you piss off users, lose trust in ability to upgrade/maintain the system and create a bunch of problems with being under pressure while transitioning the system rather than being able to do it in your own time with relatively little stress.
Google doesn't wait until they run out of hard drive space to buy more servers, they already have them by the time they need it. Apple doesn't wait until everyone has broken, got sick of or thrown out their iPhone 5 before releasing the iPhone 6, they've already had it in stores for 6 months or a year.
Bitcoin shouldn't wait until blocks are already overflowing regularly to increase its capacity, but shit here we are.

Nowhere in life do I see as much delusion as on Reddit.
You're talking about the largest Bitcoin company in the world, which has tens or hundreds of thousands of customers, established staff and viable products, VC backing, a highly recognised brand, capable and experienced leadership, globally operating infrastructure and a longer history in Bitcoin than nearly anyone else.
Yet one Reddit witch hunt starts and you say the "early mover advantage" is "all they have going for them" as if they're going to disappear or be replaced by five better companies tomorrow.
Delusional is the only word that fits.
