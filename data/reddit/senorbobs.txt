Just curious? What happened? I’m a hodler either way 
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:03:44
Which one do you recommend ?
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:18:52
Lol i hope so, what’s going on? I’m holding made too many early sells already
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:46:18
I don’t know if this is a dumb question would it be of benefit to sell and buy more at a lower price?
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:17:42
I feel like reddit is one of the main reasons I’m so into bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:43:11
Seems like any shit they put on coinbase will fly up then probably down
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:23:14
What do you use to exchange all that? Then where do you put all that money after? Over seas accounts lol

But what would 4.3 billion buy you at that time, a pizza lol

@_date: 2017-12-26 10:50:42
Thank god

It’s ok I bought a pretty good amount at 17k, it will go down now haha
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:55:06
Yeah your right maybe wait till it goes lower then buy?
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:25:19
What if your losing money when it comes to taxes?
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:53:52
People are prob selling for holidays.  I say wait till after Christmas and especially after tax returns start coming in.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:20:59
Knowing my luck this is exactly what will happen, do it for me so it goes up lol
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:21:32
What lie have they spread to buy more? Pretty sure China has done this too
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:13:52
I did the same when price went from 3700 to 3600.  Well lesson learned now I hodl
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:29:49
I wonder if a lot of people sold out for those dirty dollar bills ew. Crypto all the way!
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:40:47
Now is the time to buy guys.  You buy when it’s low, I regret selling when it went from 3700 to 3600.  ����
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:51:32
It’s like China all over again someone spreads rumor and lowers the price and buys at a discount then it skyrockets up and people like my dumbass sell left in the dust
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:34:12
Why is it taking a month to have my funds show up on my coinbase account, should I worried lol. I feel like it didn’t take that long when I started
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:48:59
People are done Christmas shopping, back on the bus? I hodl either way F it!!! Lol
