I'm not going to waste 40 minutes of my life watching that video because unlike most of this subreddit, I actually have an understanding of the banking system.
Lowered reserve ratio means more money in the system. What's new?
@_date: 2019-03-13 20:38:43
Commercial banks do not create money. Fractional reserve banking ‘multiplies’ money but that’s not the same thing as money creation. And lending it out is literally its job. 
Anyway, no one forces you to put your money in commercial banks checking/savings account. You can always put it in a safe deposit box (you will certainly pay for that benefit), buy gold bars or whatever

Erm the fed doesn't have the ability to issue treasury bonds. Fed balance sheet has gone up 4x in 10 years which may or may not be worrying. A reduction of Fed Balance sheet back to $1trn means we would see bond yield rising and stock market possibly going down though.
And yes one can buy BTC or anything instead of fiat.

That’s a fair point. All you can do is to get a new job since there is not much you can do about the Fed. And inflation over a decade is most llikely closer to 30%

1. Bailout money didn’t come from the Fed but rather the Treasury, who cannot print money out of thin air (but could issue Tresurys and sell them in the market)
2. If the Fed had kept QE going for another 5-10 years we might see that kind of concerning inflation. But they didn’t go too crazy and had reduced the size of the balance sheet over time. 
3. No one forces you to hold USD. You could easily keep your assets in gold or the Swiss francs or some gold-backed currency (if that still exists)

Can you guarantee that there would be no financial bubble / crash if you take away the Fed’s ability to set interest rates?

You stated that BTC outperforms the best stocks this year. This is provably not true. 
There are more trading opportunities in BTC and thus more opportunities to profit, but that doesn’t make BTC “outperform” the best stocks

I know how stocks work. Of course it’s not ‘backed’ in that sense of the word. It’s backed in the sense that it does earn cashflow and there are assets (real or goodwill) on the book
@_date: 2019-08-10 01:40:51
That’s not what the gold standard means. I meant the fact that you used to be able to redeem government-issued currency to gold/silver at some point. 
Agree to disagree re: monetary policy. And ‘shadowstats’ as your source? Are you serious? CPI may not cover the cost of education and healthcare and real estate, but it’s good enough. 
most companies (excluding the likes of Apple, google, etc) don’t keep a ridiculous amount of cash on their balance sheet. And the value of these companies are derived not from cash on hand but from future cashflow which will go up as the cost of goods and services go up due to inflation. Stocks are somewhat inflation protected to an extent.
@_date: 2019-08-09 21:15:17
There is zero thing wrong with buybacks. It's just an alternative way of returning capital.
I have faith in central banks not turning the US dollars into toilet papers. And most of my bond portfolio is US based and it has returned 7% over the past year, thanks to yields decreasing (which push up the bond price). Will I buy more bonds, now that they yield 1.7%? Most likely not. Will I ever buy negative-yielding bonds? Hell no.
If we see a massive inflation, I would like to own assets that will go up hand-in-hand with inflation, which isn't bond. You may rightly argue that BTC will go up as inflation increases, but I would put more of my faith in gold and commodities ETFs.
Printing their way out is BoJ's and ECB's mantra, but Fed balance sheet has actually shrunk by a ton over the past few years. Even if we follow suit, we would see mild inflation which is quite okay with me. I do not foresee any massive blow-up.

I don't know and that's why I think this whole 'currency manipulation' list is bs
“The Treasury Department is working vigorously to achieve stronger growth and to ensure that trade expands in a way that helps U.S. workers and firms and protects them from unfair foreign trade practices.  Treasury takes seriously any potentially unfair currency practices, and Treasury is expanding the number of U.S. trading partners it reviews to make currency practices fairer and more transparent,” said U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin.
Treasury found that nine major trading partners continue to warrant placement on Treasury’s “Monitoring List” of major trading partners that merit close attention to their currency practices:  **China, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, and Vietnam**
@_date: 2019-08-06 23:27:09
China does manage its currency but this 'currency manipulator' designation is purely a political play.
Two months ago, the Treasury declined to label China as a currency manipulator, but China remained on the list of monitored countries. Other countries on that list include Japan, South Korea, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Ireland, Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam. So your statement 'not every country manipulates their currency the way China does' isn't exactly correct.
Has china really changed how it manages currency since then? Not much. It's just that the US wants to pressure china into signing a trade deal.

China didn't just 'straight up change the exchange rate' - Jesus Christ. They do buy/sell actively to manage the trading range. However, if the PBoC just go ahead and change the exchange rate to an arbitrary number, even a trillion dollars in FX reserve would not be enough to maintain it.
And plenty of non-communist countries had managed currency exchange rates (with disastrous results - see the asian financial crisis of 1997). UAE, Saudia Arabia and Qatar also peg their currency to the US which according to your definition is manipulation

And there are good reasons why we have moved away from the gold standard. It's called the desire to have a monetary policy.
Dollars will lose 2% per year and that's fine, since I hold most of my assets in stocks and bonds.

Cashflow doesn’t have to be distributed as dividends in order to make the stock valuable. And in fact most companies do pay dividends and/or buyback stocks. 
Berkshire Hathaway has never paid dividends nor bought back stocks, if I recall correctly. And it’s one of the most valuable companies on the planet.

I don't hate bitcoin. I had some bitcoin back in 2016 (someone subleased my apartment and paid me 3 BTC per month when it was ~$600/btc), and still own some ETH today. While I believe in crypto as a tech, I don't know if I believe in Bitcoin as a store of value. Stocks are backed by the underlying companies cashflow. Bonds are similar. Both can fluctuate based on Fed policy. I would have added btc to my portfolio if it were to correlate less with stock and bonds, but that hasn't been the case. BTC isn't immune to Fed / SEC actions and prices have been fluctuating too much.

The monetary policy that results in zero percent inflation will harm the single mothers working paycheck to paycheck more than 1-2% inflation. 
And since she doesn’t have any savings, it’s not like her wealth is being waste away due to inflation. So BTC won’t help her either. 
She risks losing her job if people hoard more of their wealth because people would rather put their cash under their mattress than spend it

I have issues with how you state several claims that are only partially true and then jump to the conclusion that BTC must be worth way more than it is today. You have not made that logical chain clear. 
Are central banks still engaged in endless "money printing"? Yes
- ok I agree. But they have been engaging in this for decades, including the ‘down’ year of BTC, Gold, CHF. What’s the correlation of CB balance sheet expansion and the value change of gold/BTC/chf?
Are central bank fiat currencies doomed? Yes.
- hard disagree
Is Bitcoin the "hardest" form of money ever invented? Yes.
- maybe. But how does this translate to ‘BTC is definitely going to be worth way more?’
Are the bailed-out banking criminals who created 2008/9 still out of jail and committing financial crimes with impunity? Yes.
- most of them didn’t do anything illegal. And how does this have anything to do w the value of BTC?
Is debt at all levels, government, corporate, and private at unsustainable levels and growing? Yes.
- debt level is very high indeed which means we might be due for a 2008-style deleverage soon. The deleverage isn’t a positive for bitcoin either
Are there trade wars and currency wars? Yes.
- yes. And if competitive devaluation gets worse, this will be good for BTC/Gold
Are there asset bubbles (real estate, stocks, bonds)? Yes. Will they pop? Certainly.
- if they pop, this is not necessarily good for BTC. BTC isn’t the only safe haven asset out there.
@_date: 2019-09-24 07:11:58
BTC / crypto is not an uncorrelated asset class though. It’s acting as a safe haven asset, akin to gold.
I did not dispute the $400t figure. I pointed out that calling them ‘at risk’ is not meaningful.
@_date: 2019-09-27 16:40:47
BTC doesn’t have the ‘sole ownership’ of that technology. Could be replaced by another crypto asset or some yet-to-be-invented token. 
My point is historical returns aren’t predictive of future returns. Crypto collectively probably has a theoretical market cap maximum of $15-20 trillion (based on gold value in the entire world today plus fine arts plus some offshore assets). This pretty much puts a return ceiling to crypto collectively (not talking about any coin) at 50x over the next 10-20 years (assuming they become the ONLY safe haven / store-of-value asset class). That’s the best possible scenario. It cannot go up by 1000x like the original BTC run
@_date: 2019-09-24 06:44:46
CME Group doesn’t own 90% of the Dow... Wtf are these shit articles.
$400 trillion in assets are ‘at risk of devaluation’? This is technically correct, but can you actually quantify the risk? What’s the most you could lose holding real estate over 5-10 year term? What about stocks/bonds? What about BTC? Nothing is risk-free and BTC should be counted under assets ‘at risk of devaluation’ as well.
