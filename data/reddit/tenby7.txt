What country?

Stocks and stock offerings are similar. 
Bitcoin is new, but the speculation is old. People do it houses, most recently with the sub-prime lending fiasco. People do it with stamps, baseball cards, coins and paintings.
Without a psychological component to any of those things - they'd all be worth a lot less.
Bitcoin is great. The concept of bitcoin is ever better, but price psychology is older than all of us.

You're young. You'll likely get this opportunity once. 
You'll be a couple years behind your peers risking promotion or whatever.
You may look bad if BTC goes to crap.
You are taking a risk, but that's what life is aboot. Have fun.
