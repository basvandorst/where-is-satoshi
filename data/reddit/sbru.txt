Please excuse what may be a dumb question, but how does increasing block size effect the computing power needed?

and once I complete my GDAX account, what are the steps to get it from coinbase to my wallet? Also what time frame should I be expecting for that whole process?

I tried signing in to gdax with my coinbase credentials and it didn't work. Do I have to explicitly create an account on both platforms?
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:02:13
Yeah I did. They ask for my profession and employer. I feel like that's a bit more info than I'd like for them to have. :/

when depositing from my coinbase account, is there anyway to just select all? or do i have to manually type it in?

maybe not the right place to be asking this, so please direct me to the right place if I'm in the wrong, but can a wallet, namely the Ledger Nano S, store BitCoins and other altcoins like LiteCoin and Ethereum or just BitCoin?

fwiw, when withdrawing there is a faint "(MAX)" button right above the text box to input the amount

Whenever using coinbase, always make your transactions through its underlying exchange GDAX. It's free to transfer your funds and coins to GDAX from coinbase and from GDAX to another another.

What is the best way to buy btc for them without paying super high fees?
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:50:38
Ahh I see. I haven't done it but I think you can buy directly to your breadwallet through the bread app

Absolutely love it! I wish I had known about bitcoin back in 2014. Good for her and awesome science project :) On a side note, little did she know that her desire for symmetry by taping the Bitcoin logo at congruent angles from center would actually be representing two different cryptocurrencies 3 years later...
