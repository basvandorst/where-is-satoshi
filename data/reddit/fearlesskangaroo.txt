i think connecting a major well known brand with a coin would give the coin a lot of credibility - furthermore this is a direction a number of coins are going into 
- currently pornhub and other porn sites work under this model - 
people upload the porn to the website. The user "cums" to the websites and watches the porn. The website plays an ad before the video that the user watches. A company pays for the ad to an ad company, the ad company puts the ad on the site for the user to see, the revenue from the original company paying for ads is split between the ad company, the uploader and the site.
The future of crypto changes this - cutting out the advertiser and advertising company completely - so now the uploader receives crypto for uploading the content, the user receives coins for watching the content, and the website gets coins for all of these. 
So before, the model was based on traffic, think like billboards on the road, the more people that see it the more its worth. But this new model is based off engagement - how much time are you there, and how you interact with the content.
Most of these adult coins are based of steem which is exactly the same thing but more like facebook. Post an article and the more people that like it and engage with it the more you earn.
So YES, you will get paid for watching porn - HOWEVER, in saying that, there are a few coins doing this, and i would stay away from ICO's entirely. Wait till the coin is released and see what happens. When it hits a real exchange is a good time to get in.
