Javier Marti was talking about this last year in London. The guy makes some mistakes speaking English but there are some interesting points there

Have you tried to contact BitcoinGlobalInvestments.com?
I think there is a form for startups or some way to contact them, can't remember. At least I remember seeing one such form for investors in Bitcoin companies.

"First Bitcoin company" uh?

They're just getting started. They'll extract EVERYTHING from younger generations, until there is nothing left to extract:

wording sounds familiar, but a year earlier:

haha this also got my attention. If AA says "if" and not "when" anymore...should we consider it an omen? ;)
@_date: 2015-09-15 13:05:34
They wish they could
@_date: 2015-02-24 13:10:44
Another good talk

Good luck with the sale of your project. If you don't sell it but don't want to throw away the code either, get in touch. We are BitcoinGlobalInvestments.com and we could collaborate in development. We own BitcoinGroupBuying.com and will get into your space shortly, perhaps you could "come with us" instead of being competition and together we can do something better overall.
In any case, congratulations for your great idea and your coding efforts.

It reminds me of the BGI indices, created way before Coindesk, by BitcoinGlobalInvestments.com:
Similar idea but not the same.

This is getting tiring. Every day there is a post about "how awesome" Coinbase is or "how my problem was resolved, therefore they're awesome". Sounds pretty much like a social media campaign, and a cheap one at that.
If they're so awesome they'll grow on their own merits. Let it be already. 
Either these posts are from paid cheerleaders or you guys should learn that companies doing their job is a normal thing to be expected. You pay them for it.
@_date: 2013-06-07 18:14:01
I applied too, but have not heard back from them
@_date: 2013-06-12 02:12:15
I had already thought your point. 
Once someone is logging everything you do and they have the capability to do stealth file transfer, nothing is to stop them from installing keyloggers to obtain your information as you type.
Furthermore, if they have compromised companies like Gmail at the root level, we do not really know what they know (ask Donald Rumsfeld about unknown knowns, he'll explain it to you...)
On your stupidity point, there are many examples of corporate stupidity and security leaks going on at all levels, with all sorts of private and public sector companies.

Reddit can be part of the problem...it makes you feel that  "everyone knows about Bitcoin", when very few people do

I also remind them that their girlfriend is ugly

On the present and future of Bitcoin:

Character assasination? Good try NSA ;)
Concentrate on my point. I am not interested nor have the time to argue with you. If you don't get it, you don't get it. Move along.

Don't worry. These are the same people that did not predict the current "recession" (which is actually a masked depression)
Their credibility should be absolute 0

See BitcoinGlobalInvestments.com and their indices on the right hand side of the website. Been doing this for quite some time. Click on "what is this, embed this" below the index number, for more details.

haha I like your sense of humour. Maybe you would like to join us at BGI? See this:

My post won't be seen because MtGox will get carried away and come to cool the market making sure I stick to 10 points only
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:26:23
Good point, although I understand this is beyond the reach of average people with average computers?
@_date: 2013-08-30 10:54:40
I found it funny. It is useful to see the objections non-adopters have. Skeptics help to keep the mind balanced, and the hand steady.
If you truly believe that something is useful/valuable/can stand criticism, there is no reason not to enjoy a joke about it. It does  not mean anything. It is just a joke.

Most people are invested in Bitcoin personally. They all want to be rich as soon as possible and feel as a personal threat anything that goes against their -not fully consciously aware of, very personal, financially motivated- interest

"Buying bitcoins while their price is so bubbly is nothing more than a gamble. Investing in other online currencies, or in companies that can help the bitcoin economy develop, looks like a sensible use of a venture capitalist’s money."
Logical translation:
"Because investing in B directly is a gamble, it is more logical to invest in companies that cater to, and depend of B to be profitable. Nothing could go wrong with that"
Interesting reasoning.

This man is destroying his reputation one Bitcoin article at a time. Some people don't have enough with being terribly wrong about the Internet. They want to be publicly wrong about the next big thing too.

In fact, if you strip away its technological trappings -- the special brakes, the high power engine --  a Porsche closely resembles a Volkswagen.

1) It is not the first time he is wrong
2) If he admittedly does not understand it, perhaps it would be wise not to comment on it

This already exists. See BitcoinGlobalInvestments.com
You should join there

I've done plenty of research. What about you and these people with "decades of experience" that you support do some research, instead? Once again, look at the state of the economies of the world, led by people with "decades of experience". Facts speak louder than words.
Experience is worth nothing if you repeat the same mistakes over and over, and many people do.
