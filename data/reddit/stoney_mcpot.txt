i buy bitcoin at 2000... a couple weeks later bitcoin is 4000... i buy a pizza $10 with my btc: how much did i pay for the pizza?... i paid half, since the btc i use to pay are worth double then what i paid.
could i have made more money if i waited? maybe... but if the price of bitcoin EVER goes below 4000 i can simply buy back what i spent and i come out ahead. what you are talking about is just pure greed "what if"... you dont know if its gonna go up, or go down, so enjoy your profits while you can and rebuy when the price goes down
or dont and just hold if you believe we will never see the prices we have now again

hahaha do you feel the freedom yet?
damn that sucks, id just ignore it until they actually come for you... apparently the irs wants information from coinbase on all users, but they didnt give it to them, but then they settled to providiving information about accounts with more then like $20k... so chances are they dont know about all your bitcoin purchases just yet... also whats stopping you from just saying you spent them over the years buying random legal shit with it?
@_date: 2017-08-29 02:53:04


the math checks out. moon is pretty much guranteed as long as adoption keeps rising. so its not a question of "if" but a question of "when"
if you assume trust in bitcoin goes up over time and with trust comes adoption then its only a matter of time until it hits really high numbers since there are only 21m
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:15:59
well its a really bad comparison i think... you cant really do shit with those stamps. they arent really liquid. you cant pay with stamps, you can with btc (in a round about way for now)
btc can be converted to and from fiat within seconds. stamps, stocks, gold and other stuff like that, not so much
@_date: 2017-08-27 02:51:02
its very obvious isnt it... but just think about all the noobs out there that cant see it and let their greed cloud their judgment... ive been wondering now for a while "who actually BUYS bcash??"... and im starting to think its just a LOT of suckers new to crypto that fall for this obvious propaganda and manipulation...

You pay the miner fee once when you transfer the btc to the debit card company.
After that the miners arent involved.
When you use this debit card to buy a pizza for $10 you sell $10 worth of btc instantly on the market and use the fiat to pay for the pizza. For the pizza shop it just looks like a visa debit card transaction. At this point you pay a fee to the debit card service, this fee is seperate from a btc transaction fee. This fee is higher if you are using the card in a currency the card isnt based on.

if youre using USD, EURO or GBP not that bad at all. if your country doesnt use one of those 3 each transaction counts as international and theres a 3% fee. the other fee is 2.75 for atm withdrawals
so yeah still way worse then straight up using btc, but most places dont take btc yet... 
i recently signed up for xapo but havent gotten my card yet, i dont really know more then what ive read on the web. be sure to do your research, because each card is different

You really need to read up and learn how cryptography works. Its math. They can try to outlaw it, but they cant stop it...
Also crypto is anon NOW and being adopted as we speak (hence the ATH)
If you want some completely anon digital currency go buy some monero and then buy some btc with that: voila anon btc... Or just keep the monero.
They ARE trying to regulate it by making exchanges comply with KYC regulations so they can link your identity to your btc, but it is very easy to make that link go away completely

none of that matters. the only thing that matters is trust. how much do people trust in bitcoin. if you TRULY belive bitcoin is here to stay it must eventually go up. so you just buy and hodl and enjoy the ride knowing that no matter what, as long as trust grows, adoption will follow and the price will go up
@_date: 2017-08-16 14:32:16
crypto currently makes up about 0.02% of money... as trust in bitcoin grows more people start using it (mostly by investing in it) and the price goes up. as the price goes up the volatility will go down. currently 1b can effect the price of bitcoin a LOT... but once that 0.02% is 2% or 20% 1B would barely move the price...
@_date: 2017-08-14 19:35:46
there are probably cards that deal with CNY... there are cards for RUB... also what does this have to do with miners? i think the reason for this kinds of stuff is visa/mastercard and old fiat issues of national currencies...
also what are you talking about non-american? EUR and GBP are NOT american. when you have a card based on EUR and you use it in a country that uses a different currency they charge you a 3% fee... seems fair... really high fee, but it seems pretty clear to me what the rules are and isnt arbitrary at all.
edit: bitcoin debit card fees have nothing to do with miner fees

your account is 12 days old... 12.
im not paranoid i just think it very odd that a HUGE number of suspicious accounts (very new or old but with very little activity) have these very strong and loud opinions on BCH... a coin i personally consider almost worse then altcoins... almost scam levels of bad... but somehow ALL these people with these new accounts seem to love it, and hate bitcoin... WHO HATES BITCOIN?
its just a pattern you start noticing. either theres a LOT of really gullible idiots in the crypto space or theres an active Spam/FUD/astroturfing/muddying the waters campaign going on by someone with a lot of money and an interest in making BCH happen.
i dont know which is worse.

it varies from person to person. basically eventually it "clicks" and you understand it and can see the bigger picture and you start believing and become a holder.
i also think that these new ATH prices are giving people a lot of confidence... so to answer your question: 2016/2017?
its all about how much each individual "trust" in bitcoin... and at this point its been around for long enough that i feel like its here to stay for a long time to come and i think many other people are also starting to feel that way and that why were seeing the highest prices ever
i knew about bitcoins years ago, but only recently early 2017 did i have enough confidence and trust in the system to actually invest some serious money... i was late, but still early enough to enjoy the ride from 2000 to 4000
@_date: 2017-08-15 23:17:26
I dont have to make it interesting. I understand how it works. I know what it can do for ME. I also believe that with time trust in bitcoin will only grow and along with that usage and the price.
I get your point, but it really doesnt matter. As far as making a simple payment its pretty much the same. But bitcoin is much more then that. Its trustless digital money with a limited supply. It has the ability to fundementally change how we think about what "money" is.  Its the internets version of money in all its decentralized glory. Instead of being backed by a goverment its backed by math, consensus and the trust of the people. Its the currency the people chose, not the one they were given (thats a got reference)
You have to look at the big picture.

because you bought it for less yesterday? why NOT spend it? what you are talking about is just greed. greed that you COULD MAYBE get more tomorrow. but you dont know that for sure, so why not just enjoy the profits as you go?
say at the beginning of each month you buy $2000 worth of btc for $X per btc. lets say this is 50% of your income. the other 50% you keep in fiat.
now every time you want to buy something you check the price of btc, if its higher then $X, lets say bitcoin is up 20% since you bought it, great! you pay with your btc debit card (or if the shop accepts btc, you do a normal btc transaction) and enjoy your 20% discount on the pizza you just bought.
if the price is lower then $X you simply use your normal fiat debit card or cash and hodl the btc knowing that long term they are going to go up.
each month you try to not spend more then 50% your btc, so you build up btc as a long term investment knowing that with the 21m max the math checks out.
as more people start trusting bitcoin and start doing the same thing the price starts growing exponentially

no it does not. value is determined by supply and demand... sure if you lose bitcoin the supply goes down by a tiny amount, but it has no direct effect on the price...


there is no such thing as its "expected value"... theres just its current price. thats it. if you wanna guess on what it will be worth in the future go ahead, but theres not two numbers "actual" and "expected"

no its way worse then that... theres a flat fee and then 6% on top off that... so if you buy only $100 worth of bitcoin you are paying waaay more then 6%... i went and checked it out and did the math and its REALLY BAD... every single bitcoin atm gives you a better rate...
if you are buying a lot the flat fee isnt that bad, but then the 6% really hurts...
all in all its like 15% or something stupid like that (if youre buying $100 worth)

oh yeah definitly, the biggest rip off isnt even coming from xapo, but from the random bank that owns the ATM... the exchange rate they tried to give me for with drawing CHF with a EUR card was straight up criminal... at least xapo gives me a more or less correct exchange rate and is clear about the 3% fee for "international" transactions... if those 3% werent there i dont really know how they would be making any money off me (well they have a little of my btc, so theres that :P)

a wallet cant "shut you down" its just software. coinbase is an exchange.
most every exchange will need KYC stuff and if you want to get anon btc you have to get creative and or deal with shady shit.
what exactly did you buy that coinbase "shut you down"... sounds weird.
if you want anon btc, just buy on normal exchange then shapeshift to XMR and then shapeshift back from other ip?
@_date: 2017-10-10 21:19:35
so wait what the deal here?
whats wrong with xapo? do they support B2X? cause im actually fairly happy with my card, but if they support B2X I really dont want anyhting to do with them
also while i at it... i really wish i could get a card in my native currency cause right now my card is euro based and every transaction counts as an international transaction and costs me 3%... also ATMs try to rip my off thinking im a tourist, they give me shitty exchange rates and an extra flat fee so ive never used my xapo card to withdraw money from an ATM... only to pay directly
i really hope they support CHF cards eventually (and all other currencies for that matter)
@_date: 2017-09-06 13:29:23

nobody has some magic veto power mate. if you have a great idea go for it, tell the world... just be ready to get a laundry list of reasons why your idea is shit in return. and if you can explain why its not shit in the face that laundry list then you might actually be on to something

no they don't. lol if you think s2x is a good idea you are not smart. full stop.
trying to "force" something on people is NOT how bitcoin works. it just isnt. you know exactly what i meant, dont try to twist my words. bitcoin is a consensus system. only if we can agree can we change stuff... consensus come first, it doesnt "follow"... so i say to you again: this is NOT how bitcoin works. you cant come from a minority position and say "we are changing X, dont like it, well fu were doing it anyway" and expect people to just go along with it. you have to come out with your idea in advance, it has to be scrutinized by everyone, tested, retested, fucked with, critized, tested again, and only then when everyone agrees its a good idea can we MAYBE implement it.

its really bad. theres a flat fee AND a % fee... so if your buying only $100 worth of bitcoin you get ripped off hard and it comes out to something like 15-20% above current price, if not more... the flat fee really fucks you on small purchases, and for large purchases you wouldnt want to do it there either cause of the % fee... if you REALLY need some btc right now it ok i guess... but then again you cant even buy any without a swiss cellphone number (so they know who bought it) so i dont really see a situation where you would want to buy from on of these...

Money talks. If they see they can save 10% and you provide them with a simple one page 5 step tutorial how to do it, many probably will.
If they dont profit, why bother?
If its to complicated, why bother?
Make it simple AND profitable and many will do it

you can do manual replay protection... do your homework kids

Id argue that bitcoin is actually pow + software, so proof of github isnt to far off :P without the secure software we have today (commonly called core) bitcoin would have died a long time ago. Imo.
I dont understand why you think that its necessary to make a new repo and fork the code and convince people... Why cant you just work in the existing repo, convince people that your idea is good and then merge it? If your idea is actually any good it will be merged even if one or two people are against it... If the majority agrees that its something that will improve bitcoin it WILL get added... Why do you have to make a seperate fork and all that? The only reason i can think of is that your idea isnt actually good and the majority does not agree with it, but you still want to do it, but since you cant merge it you make your own repo and try to convince people that its better... But if it was actually better you couldve just convinced people and merged it into the main repo in the first place.
Do you see my point? Its all based on merit. If you have a good idea you should have no problem whatsoever to convince people its good and get it merged. If your idea is shit, well then yeah it will get vetoed and thats good.
Having said all that, lets be real here: S2X is a really shitty idea and its getting rejected by everyone for good reason. If you think otherwise i really cant help you
@_date: 2017-10-17 16:25:34
wanna trade me? ill give you 1:1... 
a bunch of companies deciding to do a hardfork with a way to short timeframe is just not how bitcoin works. it just isnt. if you dont understand why s2x is a really really shitty idea i cant help you mate...
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:23:21
we dont, we never will, and it doesnt matter. its not an issue
@_date: 2017-10-16 23:53:06
its been done already. i think their calles casius coins or something... i think the guy that makes them had to stop for some reason, but they exists... and last i heard they are actually worth almost 2 BTC even though the private key only has 1 BTC :D
yup here you go:

not for another month, if at all... 
block 494784.
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:49:46
its getting out late... but better late then never.
you shouldve sold it in the first two weeks right after the fork like all the other smart people... you didnt cause you got suckered into believing it could go up, but it will only ever go down. so just sell it while you can still get something for it... or dont... im not your mom, and i really dont care if you lose money
@_date: 2017-10-11 04:01:57
like support support or just "support"?
are they gonna try to turn my precious bitcoin into some b2x shitcoin and call it bitcoin or are they just gonna give me some b2x which i can then instantly dump for some extra btc... big difference...
@_date: 2017-10-17 14:34:32
Sure, but thats all public. If devs start vetoing good ideas people will stop following them very very quickly. Also the core project is far from a "small group" its hundreds if not thousands of the smartest devs alive all trying to find mistakes in each others work
@_date: 2017-09-06 15:38:12
dude if youve actually spent any money there, youre getting ripped off really hard...
next time do the math and find out what the "current price" their actually selling you by just pretending the fees dont exist and you are buying X bitcoin for Y $... if the current price is like 3800 euro, youll probably be paying like 4200+ xD
@_date: 2017-10-18 03:05:20
I was here 5 months ago and i can tell you with there was def never such a time. The initial reaction was "lol" and everyone was focused on bcash so it really wasnt talked about as much as now
The general reaction was "8MB blocks? what are these guys smoking?"
@_date: 2017-10-09 13:01:14
i think some of that btc should be used to sponsor a smashbros player. getting m2k or mango to rep bitcoin would bring awareness to thousands of young people that just love to throw around money on twitch using paypal and bits n shit like that.
i think one of the use cases for bitcoin that currently works really well is sending donations over the internet... and twitchs whole business modell is based around that.
so if you can get the twitch crowd into bitcoin, well thats pretty much the whole next generation right there
also mango is a straight gambler so im sure hed be all over bitcoin :P
or even better: epic netplay tournament with bitcoin sponsored prize pool
the smashbros scene is still very much grassroots so a little goes a long way its also a very tightly knit community so if one of the top 5 players talks about bitcoin thats gonna reach 100k people no problem
@_date: 2017-09-04 14:00:05
do you mean an exchange?
@_date: 2017-10-15 13:31:45
also nothing. money is just what we call it. if the "trust" in bitcoin goes up while the "trust" in old paper money is going down over time, that shift away from the old system towards a decentralized new money system, based on math instead of trust in goverments, would make the paper money "return to its intrinsic value -- zero." just very gradually and over a very long time

if it has the same algo as zcash im having a hard time thinking of reason anyone would ever "switch" to bitcoin gold instead of zcash (or any other gpu mined crypto for that matter)
the only way "bitcoin" can switch the pow is if it includes every single block up to the fork... if it doesnt, its really just another altcoin with a name similar to bitcoin, no? cause once bgold (lol) forks off it has its own chain and all transactions will be unique on that chain and it wont have anything to do with btc.
i get what your saying, but i think doing a pow switch "in advance" just turns it into yet another shitty uninspired altcoin cash grab...
brb. making bitcoinero with the cryptonote algo
@_date: 2017-09-04 14:54:45
dont think so... last i heard theyre working on it
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:00:35
The supply will never be expanded. If 8 digits devisable arent enough we can eventually make devisable into 10 digits or whatever. There will still be only 21mil
@_date: 2017-10-17 14:52:01
Have you ever heard these fuckers talk? God damn brainiacs i tell ya. Im not saying they are THE smartest people alive or anything, im just saying that as far as devs go the people that contribute to core have to be pretty fukin smart if they want to contribute. This has nothing to do with fanboy stuff (lol?) Its just the way it is. Bitcoin sw is very complicated so if you want make changes and shit you have to understand it and be able to convince an army of other btc nerds that your idea is good... Thats no simple task and id argue that being able to do that proves you are pretty damn smart

just chill and wait for easy tutorials that explain how to protect against replay protection. or yknow... google
