Yep good point. That's the advantage of decentralized p2p exchanges :) 
@_date: 2017-02-05 13:58:28
It's an interesting take on things. It could make sense in this scenario. Especially since so many hypothesis were put forward that pointed at MtGox and/or China as pushing prices. Perhaps with hindsight we can have a better idea. 
Though we should note that the same people who do not buy into another bubble may be an insignificant number - especially compared to the growing mass of people that are only learning/hearing about bitcoin in 2017. 
@_date: 2017-02-16 15:18:58
yeah it has to be some early stage. Perhaps a future speculative bubble for bitcoin platforms on the horizon? Who knows at this point ...
@_date: 2017-02-16 15:17:22


True enough. Though from an investment perspective, you could well consider this the "smart money" phase of certain prominent bitcoin exchanges. Only time will tell. Things look very positive for bitcoin-only exchange platforms. Japan is a market I'm following closely. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 18:11:55
Good explanation. That makes perfect sense it many ways. But this limits the explanation to the rapid price drop. What about the rapidly rising price (boom/bust in the space of weeks) twice back in 2013? Why are we seeing similar price rises now, but just stretched over a larger time relatively speaking?
@_date: 2017-02-05 11:40:15
Great thank you. I was unaware that Quoine offered leveraged trading
@_date: 2017-02-05 18:24:31
This could be of interest. Thanks. 


Though, would this not mean that the price would only rise faster with each boom ? I mention this because the current bull market is a progressive one compared to many over the last 5 years. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 13:37:45
Could anyone expand further on this? I've always imagined the market liquidity expanding as more people join the community. Yes liquidity was less in 2013, but how many people actually wanted to buy bitcoin compared to now?
@_date: 2017-02-05 18:09:09
Interesting. I have indeed heard about the mempool backlog, but is this not to do with miners choosing to prioritize certain transactions (related to attached fees)? The reason that I say this is because it seems [only certain blocks are full]( while most are not yet at capacity. I do realize this represents an issue, so maybe you're right and it could be 'capping' the rate at which price is increasing.  
@_date: 2017-02-05 18:21:34
I've been hearing similar suggestions from the bitcoin trading sub. This could be an interesting angle, especially if you look at the bitcoin price history on the exponential scale. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 13:41:24
Thanks that's a good point. As you mention, both those answers are mostly inclusive of themselves. Though I do still keep them separate as one could argue that there were enough exchanges in 2013 to match the demand at that time - thus not everyone might agree that there were too few exchanges. 


Goes to show that the ecosystem has become a very healthy one indeed. Now we just need to push and help decentralized exchanges pick up market share. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 11:45:46
Great comment and encouragement :) 
@_date: 2017-03-14 11:43:11
Having the astronauts buying on the ISS would be cool too. And yep Greenland is all we need now (plus more in Africa)! 
@_date: 2017-02-05 18:20:00
Great, I appreciate the in-depth reply re Willy bot. 


This is interesting - I was unaware. 


That seems to be the consensus among trading experts. It seems quite plausible, and does indeed explain the difference with our current bull market - which a more stable and progressive nature. As many have suggested, today we have much better balance of choice of exchanges too. This effectively renders 'secret trading bots' useless. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 11:45:22
Good point. Though this is no way representative of which country is actually buying the most bitcoin, it's just cool to open up Analytics and see the whole world is really getting into bitcoin. Things were so different in 2013 when I started with crytpocurrency 
@_date: 2017-03-31 12:17:57
This sub still produces quality content &amp; discussion regardless. Should you want to check elsewhere, my recommendations for credible &amp; neutral bitcoin news sources:
- [Andreas Antonopolus]( - for a very neutral yet active proponent advancing bitcoin the technology. 
- [Lets Talk Bitcoin Podcast]( - one of the first bitcoin podcasts. Adam B Levine went on to create the LTB network for helping similar podcasts.
- [ on Twiter - a upcoming bitcoin writer with a relatively neutral stance. 
- [ on Twitter - the activities &amp; stances of influential exchanges in the bitcoin and cryptocurrency space. 
- [Bitcoin Knowledge Podcast]( by Trace Mayer. Good interviews with key community participants. 
@_date: 2017-02-16 15:17:56


That is certainly true for Bitflyer
@_date: 2017-01-19 16:58:03
I think you may have a point about bitcoin ATMs. I've been following the evolution of CoinATMradar and to say it's quite impressive would be an understatement. They're popping up everywhere. This is good news either way.
@_date: 2017-01-01 18:43:00
And so when will Gemini get ETF passed? This could be big news for the bitcoin exchange scene. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 22:25:50
When I was comparing Kraken vs Coinbase there was some mention that the latter also had carried out proof of coins in cold storage. Though I'd be interested to read up about this.
@_date: 2017-08-29 22:35:09
Thanks for this info. Anyone know how much he invested? I guess I missed this point when I was elaborating the list of Kraken advantages &amp; disadvantages. When did he invest in the exchange?
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:11:47
thanks, the hardest part of this Kraken review was indeed assessing what users generally though of the exchange. Most importantly, do people think kraken is safe or not? It turns out that most customers trust the exchange far more than they do for other competitors. 
Yep I was just as impressed when i researched Kraken's CEO, Jesse - and found that he has has a major in Philosophy... I like to joke to myself that this explains why the exchange isn't beginner friendly.
@_date: 2017-08-29 22:24:25
thanks, I tried to give a fair and balanced report on Kraken since there wasn't much out their for new users researching up on the exchange
@_date: 2017-08-29 22:31:57
Interesting point. My assessment of Kraken did show many users praising them for fast hassle-free withdraws. They should get a big thumbs up for this. SO many other exchanges think they can walk right into your personal life &amp; adn demand any information they want... all this just to please Mr regulator 
@_date: 2016-11-23 16:14:18
Interesting observation. There's also a lot of exchanging that happens 'off-chain' on exchanges 
@_date: 2016-11-19 10:43:22
a cup and handle apparently. I would still say that bananas illustrate the emerging tend far better than anything else.
@_date: 2016-11-23 15:48:47
Thank god modern exchanges provide transparency in a way that emptyGox could never have
@_date: 2016-12-31 19:07:14
Excellent, thanks for the links. I'll definitely be referencing and following this closely in the future. 
@_date: 2016-11-19 10:26:36
how could i have missed that!
@_date: 2016-12-08 11:47:39
Gotta have some sort of an easy reference for bitcoiners and new arrivals in this space.
@_date: 2016-11-23 15:37:10
Good point - Bitstamp was [co-founded in August 2011](
Any sources on BitcoinChina ?
@_date: 2017-01-01 18:44:07
What makes you recommend Gemini over others, and how do you think they'll bring on more users than other bitcoin investment sites?
@_date: 2016-12-31 19:04:56


I do see what you're saying. Though I've always viewed the community as the larger group of users that have a stake in bitcoin the technology. Thus this encompasses the multitude of alternative-bitcoin currencies - who are in themselves just a means of 'testing' new features and further expanding bitcoin's potential. 


Let's not forget that Cryptsy also offered USD-BTC trading.
@_date: 2017-08-29 22:30:04


Yeah, thanks. For me the best way to really scrutinize Kraken was to dig deep and find out who the guys are behind the exchange. Thankfully the operators are a pretty serious and professional crowd - so it was easy to find abundant information on them.
@_date: 2016-12-08 11:46:02
Good point. Though I'd say it's more a question of how many will now take up the opportunity to offer these services. After all, that's what being an entrepreneur is all about right? Fill a void, meet an unmet demand.. make money. Here's a void. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 22:27:59
Nice, informative Kraken analysis - especially your feedback about their trading engine being unresponsive at peak trading times. I'm hearing that from many users now. I'll fit this in to my report on the next upcoming update.
@_date: 2016-12-31 18:32:12


You raise some good points. Bitfinex definitely strikes a sharp contrast to Cryptsy with regards to the level of professionalism following the theft. 
It's true that that Bitfinex took their platform right offline, while Cryptsy carried on trading for a long time and only slow deactivated certain coins (possibly trying to gain further on arbitrage by pushing up prices of remaining coins available for withdrawal?).


Their publicly available traffic stats are on [similarweb](


Great to hear about Bitfinex's solid commitment to their users. Do you have an article/reference for further info? Poloniex did something similar after they were hacked (far less was stolen though) and have gained a strong trust within their user-base. 
@_date: 2016-11-19 10:10:45
very true! Bananas are what came to mind first for me. But now you mention... [cup and handle]( seems pretty damn possible too
@_date: 2016-12-03 13:27:02
Hey! Cool wasn't aware of those.... any sources for bitfloor and btc-e?
@_date: 2017-04-04 12:58:33
For the past year I have been actively tracking all the best sites to buy bitcoin on  It's an interesting space as things move fast, sites come &amp; go, people get really passionate about which exchange they use. 
From what I've learned so far, here's what may suit you best: 
- **Kraken** tends to get excellent reports form customers in Europe and the USA. It mixes the best and lowest fees with easy deposits / SEPA withdraws. Liquidity is always high for large purchases. **Downside:** they go offline when the price booms. 
- **Bitsquare** - a fully decentralized peer to peer marketplace. Highly recommended and regarded by advanced bitcoiners. The client software actually offers more language choices than any other centralized exchange does right now. This is the best place to buy bitcoin if innovation, safety, and emerging trends are priorities for you. IMO these type of exchanges represent the path forward for digital currencies, especially so with the coming of lightning networks. **Downside:** volume is lower than centralized exchanges. The learning curve may be slightly steeper - relatively speaking.
- **Coinbase** is a love/hate story, especially on this sub. They have done much to advance adoption for new bitcoiners. The site UI is easy to use and offers credit card purchases along with multisig vault storage for advanced users. Works great in many countries including the USA, UK, Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, India, Mexico, Canada. **Downside:** much criticism for accidental account freezes &amp; support can be slightly slow to respond. They also have little to no presence on reddit. 
- **Blockchain** is the largest &amp; most trusted web-wallet service and have recently allowed for buying bitcoin with a credit card. Remember - never store all your coins in an online wallet or on an exchange. **Downside:** purchasing BTC only available in EU countries, but more coming. 
- **Gemini** are gaining traction, especially for large buyers. Their system works through auctions and regular exchange trading. Very safe and well established. Founded by the Winklevoss twins. **Downside:** only available for North America
- **Localbitcoins** is a good site to buy bitcoin with cash and meet other bitcoiners in person. Bank transfers are the norm too. They're really popular in places/currency zones where most other exchanges don't or won't accept deposits. **Downside:** there are safer places to get BTC than through Localbitcoins. 
- **WeSellCrypto** is a lesser known exchange, but allows you to buy bitcoin with PayPal (you can also do this on Localbitcoins). This is great for just getting 15usd worth, but any more and it gets cumbersome. **Downside:** as with any PayPal to bitcoin site, fees are huge.  
- **Bitfinex** is the go-to site for day traders and large volume purcahses. They have recently made the headlines after refunding all customers following a hack last year. You could therefore argue that this is a very safe site to buy BTC. **Downside:** situated in Hong-Kong and only really worth using if you're looking to make revenue by day trading
- **Bitstamp:** based in the UK (the site uses euros), I really like this site and I often recommend to friends wanting to get bitcoins with a credit card that this is the best place. It's a very safe platform with plenty of good feedback from customers. **Downside:** ID verification can take some time
@_date: 2017-09-04 17:17:47
I really like this reply to the above comment - it's a nicely constructed counter argument for the trollbox. I'll also mention your point about trollbox FUD in my Poloniex advantages and disadvantages - it's very true that this was used by certain ppl to influence trades, pump, dump etc. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 17:15:41
Yes, this is precisely what I'm reading from many reviews of Poloniex on bitcointalk. I've tried to reflect this backlog of support tickets in my assessment article. It's true that aside from slow support, and the occasional DDOS outage, things do work quite smoothly on Polo :) Good job to them for taking on so many users in such a short timespan
@_date: 2017-09-04 14:36:50
Thanks, I really enjoyed reading your feedback! 


Yes, me too - at least i did think so before researching and assessing Poloniex in full. I also mentioned that this anonymity may be a voluntary security measure. But it would reassure me as a user to know there was a trusted public figure behind such a large cryptocurrency exchange. 
@_date: 2017-01-19 20:10:11
Good point, thanks for pointing this out. I'm not sure to what extent this applies to all mainland Chinese exchanges (Huobi, OKcoin, BTCC), but it seems we're able to [verify this]( for OKcoin. Hopefully it will stay the same going forward. This will be seen as good news for the industry. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 14:39:13
Ah good point. I remember they had a trollbox that was just as active as the one on Cryptsy. I'll update &amp; mention this on my Poloniex review.


Yes, I'm reading certain comments on many forums of users getting nearly no response from support. 
How could Poloniex improve their transparency in your opinion ?
@_date: 2017-05-21 22:29:36
Yep those are good places. And for buying or selling with a credit card there's CEX and Bitstamp who have proven themselves to be worthy platforms. Of course fees will be higher when using a card. But yes, seeing that OP mentions a "personal strategy" I would guess that he/she is accustomed to trading and therefore would not use a credit card (since this is nearly always far more expensive than bank transfer deposits).
