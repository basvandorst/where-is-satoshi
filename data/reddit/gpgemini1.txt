I second that.
I had an order today I didn't make.
At first I thought that I must have missed it, since I made alot of orders today, but now I see I'm not the only one.

Exactly my thoughts. Joined right before the Dec' crashes :)

If the price never reached 633, then why BitCoinWisdom **and** TradingView show that it did ?
@_date: 2014-02-24 18:40:32
what is the exchange/symbol ?

Thanks. Still doesn't answer the question where is the broken part.
I've opened a ticket at BitStamp. Will update when have a reply.

Remove the signup wall for starters. It's the internet, we are all tired of creating more and more passwords.
Add some zoom functions, even a very basic one. Otherwise it feels too static.
Add some description of what each graph means, how it is calculated and the units of measure.

Related with more info:
**The transaction did not take place.**
BitStamp seem to publish wrong numbers. It doesn't seem like a charting or BitCoinWisdom bug.
I've created a ticket at BitStamp and will update when have more info.

nice one. Edit to 3500 BTC potential barrier.

That's not how exchanges work.
To get a price lower then the current "market price", all other open buy orders above that price HAVE to be filled. Otherwise it creates an unfair market.
In BitStamp, creating a sell order below market price is is infact almost the same as a market order. It will fill the request from the order book, not at the specified price.
The behavior in the SS above and the other reddit thread is a clear bug.

The most important thing was not said - "do not risk what you  cannot afford to lose".
If you need this money, don't bet on bitcoin no matter how much you or others believe in it (or any other single investment for that matter).
If you have accepted that this money is no longer "yours", but is part of a risky investment that can go to zero, do not sell at a loss. Sit back, and wait until the investment has grown to a level of your satisfaction.
What ever you do, do not day trade (sell and buy in short intervals). It's the fastest way to lose your money if you don't know what you are doing.

I know what candle sticks are.
Please read my post again.
- My order to buy at 640 did NOT execute, even though it was in "open" state for hours before that time.
- BitStamp transactions log doesn't show any transactions at that time anywhere near that value.
