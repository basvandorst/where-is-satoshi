This is already a feature of the blockchain. If a particular blockchain becomes undesirable for any reason (fees, transaction times, security, lack of privacy) then anyone who wants to is free to utilize another blockchain like litecoin, ethereum, dash, zcash or even fork the current blockchain and start their own or start their own from scratch. If it's better then the money will follow.

Reminds me of that old movie "Disclosure" in which, for some reason, one had to access files in VR despite the fact that it would have been waaay quicker to just look them up in a conventional database. Don't take that as criticism, I love this idea and will probably pull the trigger on a vive setup just to play with it. Nice work!

Gotcha. Well, prob wasn't timing then. I use jaxx mostly for purchases online and I guess the high fees work in my favor since I want those transactions to go through sooner than later but I could see how that would cramp your style if your making multiple transactions, especially from multiple addresses. Fees could add up quick. Sorry I don't have a better alternative, was mostly curious. Good luck.

I'm having a serious internal struggle over investment portioning. I initially converted 10% of my  total investments (stocks, 401k, precious metals, bonds) when Bitcoin was trading around 100 bucks. I also have bought more over the years in small sums spread across the months. In addition to that, whenever Bitcoin is a purchase option on an item or service I want, I purchase bitcoin for the transaction and move the rest into my cold wallet. As a result of the price increase since I began seriously investing in it, Bitcoin now accounts for almost 60% of my portfolio. The conservative investor in me is screaming to diversify but the greedy-pig in me wants to convert the rest of my securities (excluding 401k) to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-21 19:05:23
Start a Gemini account if you can and buy through them. Better prices on bitcoin, lower fees and they let me purchase bitcoin instantly once I initiate the ACH. It's awesome. You won't be able to take your Bitcoin off the exchange until the ACH clears on  your banks end but you can trade the coins all you want until then. Good way to catch an uptick or bail on a crash without waiting on slow-ass banks.

I think the same and worse can be said of the backers of BU. There's money flowing into all of the solutions so why just follow one trail? I believe segwit encourages decentralization and that any fee skewing effect will be minimal and possibly fully mitigated in future incarnations of Core.

I'm US and use Coinbase and Gemini. My favorite is Gemini but neither is likely to steal your money. There are also bitcoin ATMs that take cash in some places. The fees are really high and the Bitcoin itself will probably be more expensive but it could work in a pinch. Just google them. Be suspicious of anyone who wants you to wire them money or use PayPal friends/family transfer or venmo.

If you want to buy discretely then the price goes up, as well as the risk. If you want to wire me some cash then I'll be happy to deposit some bitcoin in any address you like for a 15% markup. $2500 minimum with possible delays for large quantities that exhaust the supply I have on hand as it's the weekend.
@_date: 2017-02-12 16:53:38
Oh, I see. I thought you were day trading or long term investing. Sounds like you're trying to buy the BTC and then spend it. You can buy/sell your coin as much as you want but just can't withdraw the balance until deposit clears. I guess b/c I already have value in my account it didn't occur to me b/c I can withdraw my other coins while waiting on my new purchases to clear. FWIW, I also really miss circle. Waaay better than coinbase.

I treat Bitcoin like my stock investments and buy a little each month. I can't predict the future but I can say that Bitcoin along with a relaxed purchasing strategy has been incredibly good to me so far and I will continue to keep a portion of my investment capital in Bitcoin until the miners start closing up shop en masse. I do keep a small amount on an exchange to "day trade" whenever I need a thrill but my longterm BTC holdings have brought me much more profit since I started.
@_date: 2017-02-24 20:59:20
Dude, you are waaaaay overthinking this. Bitcoin isn't a religion, it's a decentralized commodity that can behave as a currency and transaction system. Just like pork bellies or gold, people are going to do whatever they want with it after they buy into it. It doesn't matter, it will still be Bitcoin until it isn't and when that happens there are plenty of other blockchains to invest in.

I didn't mean to insinuate that Coinbase was not an exchange, just that they didn't show the active trades on the home page like most others. The average Coinbase user doesn't see the trades happening. In fact, I use CB almost exclusively through the phone app for quick purchase with a Debit Card when I need it. To be honest, it feels more like a wallet with a buy option for me.
@_date: 2017-02-07 22:51:27

I think he means on the exchanges. You won't see it on Coinbase but if you use Gemini, Kraken, Poloniex, Bitfinex or another exchange you will see the purchases happening live in a window. Shows amounts purchased, price, currency for each trade.

I never understood these concepts. Even the Cassaius Coin, although pretty, was still just a paper wallet and some gold that didn't need to be together and didn't offer any added security. Nice as art, I guess. These things aren't worth anything to me personally but there are probably collectors out there. Not sure how secure the "tamper resistant" seal makes me feel, that BTC might disappear after they get paid.

One nit pick with this comment: saying that some of these companies wouldn't exist without the DCG is mere speculation, since we didn't experience a timeline without DCG we don't actually know if another group or entity would have filled the vacuum left by DCGs absence. Plus, one of those companies could turn out to be the next Enron, in which case the world would be a much better place without them.

Sorry chief, already spotted two on their map that I know aren't there, don't need to look anymore. This is propaganda and they are not removing any machines from their list as they close. They don't even claim to as far as I can see from the site.
Wait, found something on their "submit a machine" page. Looks like if someone takes the time to email the owner of the site then you can report one disabled. He mentions in the same paragraph that updates to the site are made by hand and may take a few days. I don't think it's malicious or propaganda anymore, I just think there's little incentive for someone to take the time to find out how to report a disabled BTM and then email this guy who may or may not feel like dealing with it at the time. The numbers are inflated by the same lack of enthusiasm that plagues the BTMs in the first place. Or maybe not, wish a BTM operator would chime in. The few I've bumped into at bitcoin meet ups seem more like enthusiasts who are willing to operate at a loss just to spread the gospel but I don't know if that's representative.

That's a long time to keep a ton of Bitcoin traders from wanting to trade. If my account wouldn't let me withdraw coins then I wouldn't put more money in until that was resolved. Don't think we've seen the bottom of this one yet. Check back in a week.
@_date: 2017-02-11 22:05:39
If you start down that road then the decimal moving may not stop. When a mBTC is worth 1000 then people will think it's too expensive again and the decimal will have to be moved again. Pointless. Better to simply educate people on how it works and create wallets and other interfaces that are easier for laypeople to understand. I've also noticed that some wallets are to starting to default to mBTC already but the real challenge will be the exchanges as they are the entryway to bitcoin for most people these days. If you truly want to change perception then the price on all those tickers needs to be in mBTC and that's got nothing to do with Bitcoin code. I would also like to point out that anyone who wouldn't buy bitcoin at 1000 but would buy mBTC for 10 is probably not the sort who should be investing in Bitcoin in the first place as they are not particularly savvy since there is no difference.

This sounds like a glitch. I have used Gemini for a while and have always received prompt (within two business days, counting the day I opened the ticket) responses. I have also been able to instantly buy from transfers before they clear with no problem. Try sending them an email directly instead of through the support page and alert them to the issue. All that being said, I still keep my coinbase account open even though they are super expensive and always seem to have issues with my purchases whenever the price dips, just in case there ever is a problem.
@_date: 2017-02-11 23:03:41
Refreshing. I feel the same way. In fact, I'm starting to wonder what the price of Bitcoin would be if everyone just stopped flooding the world with panic ridden posts demanding adoption for BTCU or Segwit. In the end, this is exactly what Bitcoin was designed to do: fork it if you want to and if your coin is worth the most then it wins. This system allows the miners to make moves that they feel is in the best interest of Bitcoin and the end consumer decides if he wants to buy it or trade in it. Elegant.

Anytime a fascist or totalitarian government installs itself, one of the first things they do is restructure the financial institutions so that they have total control. By making sure no one can transact without their approval they can prevent wealth from funding agendas counter to theirs. Bitcoin won't work well with that plan and will probably be banned. The trick is to get a bunch of coins now so you can cash them out when you reach your refugee status destination of choice. I'm hoping for Canada.
@_date: 2017-02-09 22:01:40
Why are the ATMs so expensive? The two I've visited are set to 12% markup plus fees, which at current prices is over a hundred bucks. Seems like someone would have implemented a sliding scale for these things so that as price increases the markup % decreases. They could still earn a tidy profit without scaring people off. I would support them at a small loss but damn, they're just greedy af.
@_date: 2017-02-10 16:34:41
It is my understanding that it is a mix of caution and what could possibly be construed as corruption. As you stated, the safest thing for these bozos to do is deny it but they don't necessarily have to do that publicly. There may be closed door conversations that we are not privy to that may outline plans moving forward. For instance: "hey guys, we don't want to publicly deny your request but we're not ready yet. Come back next year with x amount of backers/funds/etc and we'll talk."
There is also likely pressure from old guard Wall Street that will ask these guys to block things that compete with their plans and goals. This is the part that some may find a little corrupt as it involves insiders with interests possibly counter to that of the investors.

Yeah, this part is unfortunately unavoidable in some cases. It is my personal opinion that because Bitcoin is worth more than Ethereum, the fork will go smoother. I have no historical data to back this up but something inside my lizard brain tells me that only mad men would willingly destroy any value in the network they are so heavily invested in. I think we are just seeing a lot of posturing, chest beating, and shouting these days. Once one side begins to gain momentum over the other I think the money and infrastructure will follow. But then again, Bitcoin gunna be Bitcoin so who knows.

Before Trump got elected I didn't think there was a chance in hell that the SEC would allow a Bitcoin ETF this early in the game but with all the crazy moves going on and pressure being placed on different agencies...well, they just might let this one through. Still not confident, things are waaay too unpredictable for me to wager much on it but it will be interesting to see. I guess the other thing to remember is that the money behind the curtain might not be ready to play with Bitcoin. If all the people that pull the strings globally haven't figured out a way to control and profit from it yet then they won't legitimize it.
@_date: 2017-02-24 23:25:12
Stick it in the Coinbase vault and you'll be ok. 2FA, email confirmation for transfer and keep an eye on it, no problem. Hardware wallets are safer, obviously, but don't sweat it until you have enough BTC that the thought of losing it makes you sweat. Good luck!

Were these transactions sent at the same time? Fees are a moving target, just because you paid one price at one time does not lock that price in permanently. I use jaxx and like it because non of my transactions has ever taken more than one block.

I bought a bunch of frozen Mt. Gox coins, before the theft was revealed, from Btcbuilder.com (I think) which was offering a binary market to trade them offline from Mt. Gox. I purchased at 8 to 1.

Well, it won't let me finish the article without installing an app so I will just assume this is pure speculation based on cherry picked data. I don't know what the odds are of this ETF going through but I know the old guard won't approve it until they are positioned to compete.
There is a possibility that much of the recent price increase is dummy companies buying up Bitcoin before the ETF is allowed so that they can then sell it back to themselves for pre-ETF prices thus offering investors an immediate gain on their investment and thereby making BTC seem more attractive.
Conversely, all of the recent upswing may be purely speculative about the impending ETF(s) and once they are denied the price will chase itself back down its rabbit hole.
Or maybe none of that matters at all and Bitcoin just be Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-10 15:42:10
This has never happened. Not saying it can't, just that it never has and is therefore unlikely. Most likely the ETF(s) will be withdrawn by the submitters which is by far the most common outcome to these scenarios.

I don't like giving advice but I don't mind talking about my moves and theories. I am still buying both BTC and Eth and keeping any payments that I receive in crypto form. I believe the price will rise (or at least have the potential to rise) all the way up until they announce that the ETF is a no-go. I will be watching the website all night/day Thursday and Friday and as soon as they post bad news I will sell what I keep on the exchange. Hopefully I will buy low on first dip and sell high on dead cat bounce and then wait for things to settle. Of course, that plan will most likely turn to shit-pudding as soon as someone panics soooooo, I got that going for me. I treat trading like gambling.

If I don't like or trust the underlying code for Bitcoin then I will continue to diversify into Eth and PIVX. Easy. Also, not very scary. And if you do think it's scary, just sell and wait it out.

@_date: 2017-02-13 07:19:42
Not entirely sure what you mean but I haven't read anything that lead me to believe that one company would be processing most of the transactions. For the sake of argument, let's assume that's true. In this case, it doesn't necessarily matter who processes most of the transactions as long as the miners are still earning enough to incentivize mining. Another thing to consider is the fact that some miners are already signaling support for segwit which wouldn't make sense if it was such a bad deal for them.

Good luck being ignorant, just remember: only you can stop the cycle and read a fucking TOS for yourself so that you will finally understand this mysterious concept. Lol! How old are you? I find it hard to believe that someone can truly be as naive as you and yet still own Bitcoin. Ha!

You've done fine. I've been around Bitcoin for a long time and this is not the first or worst drama it's seen.  Hold on to it and the price will rise. It may dip first, but it always rises.
@_date: 2017-03-08 05:03:15
I agree that's a possibility so I up voted but I'm afraid my feelings on the matter are more...complicated. I believe that Bitcoin is at a crossroads between being perceived as digital gold/digital commodity and being perceived as digital cash. 
If the people who wish to see Bitcoin used more for small daily transactions get their way then I believe the price will either fall or be stuck with highs in the 1200 range like we've seen. If it becomes cash then people will spend it more and the market will become more liquid and I believe this will drive price down. 
If the people who prefer it to operate more like digital gold have their way then I believe it will be perceived more as a precious commodity of limited supply and collected thus driving the price up as supply becomes more sought after. 
I couldn't tell you which scenario is best for Bitcoin but I'm pretty sure of what would be best for the speculators and holders.
@_date: 2017-03-09 06:51:05
Ouch! Such a stinging wit! I think my favorite thing you said is "must be a 90's macho thing," because this tells me you didn't even get to see the 80s (much more machismo). Now that I know for a fact I'm dealing with a little boy, let me tell you your future. 
Everyone I grew up with that spent time trolling (back then it was on AOL, lol) had a shitty life compared to those who were able to muster a little understanding of others. The funniest part was how much that disparity grew over time. You see, the people that weren't filled with all those feelings of inadequacy that drive the trolls were able to make amazing lives for themselves filled with accomplishments, adventures, and good times. They make friends easily and can earn the respect of anyone they choose to. 
The trolls, however, found their lives difficult and always felt like someone had it better than them (almost everyone did, of course) and they blamed everyone else for their inability to understand and get along with others. In their careers they would always top out somewhere in lower management or end up in sales and they grew to be as ugly on the outside as they always were on the inside. Their emptiness craves shitty food, alcohol and drugs. 20 years later and there's only one left that I keep in touch with. The others ate themselves to death, drank themselves to death, or outright committed suicide. You could tell they hated seeing all those happy and successful people who actually managed to make a difference in the world because they just couldn't understand how those people did it. 
The one troll I know from childhood who's still alive and on my FB feed spends every night complaining online about how it's everyone's fault but his own that he works a lame sales job in a shitty little town and lives alone with no hope of ever having a family. No one likes or comments on his posts but he keeps making them. He attacks women, minorities, liberals, athletic teams and even his own siblings and we all just kinda feel sorry for him because we know someday they'll find him dead and decomposing and alone, months after he actually died. I'm not psychic and I'm saying that you'll meet the same fate as these poor bastards but I've got enough life experience to know that you'll be trapped by your own shitty personality, whether you ever realize it or not. I'd pity you but I know you'll never do the same for anyone else so why bother. 
Damn, this is so depressing I'm going to have to watch It's Always Sunny twice tonight. Keep on trolling, buddy. I guess we could all keep pretending that you're offending us if it makes you feel any better. It's the least we can do for a damaged little creature like yourself, I suppose.

I bought my first Bitcoin from a guy who I had to meet in the virtual world Second Life. He gave me coordinates to meet him at and he showed me to a pedestal where I had to deposit Linden Lab dollars (which were free market at that time even though they could make an infinite amount) and then enter my Bitcoin receiving address. Cost me 3 bucks USD a Bitcoin and I bought 10. Just knew I was getting ripped off but they showed up in my wallet after a tense 7 minutes or so of waiting. I then immediately used them to play poker in what was the first Bitcoin poker site (to my knowledge) with the only 12 other people on the planet who knew how to play poker with Bitcoin. Later, when the price jumped to 20 bucks a coin, the operator claimed that he had been hacked and that all the coins were gone and he disappears shortly after that. I bought another 10 at 20 bucks a pop from VirWox and then the market crashed. Sat on those until 2013.

I think it's very interesting that we have had such exciting news on the horizon for months with no major catastrophes to kill investor confidence and we still topped out around gold like last time. There may be some kind of mental block currently preventing investors and speculators from believing it can perform better than gold. If they ever approve a fund that opens up the market to laymen then we may see that mental blockade busted.

Beware of FOMO *bitcoin addition*
You should have just seen it through and held the bitcoins until the payoff made sense. People always say you can't make money mining but if your electricity is free or close to it then I say go for it!
@_date: 2017-03-08 04:30:20
This is my gut as well. I know we are in unprecedented territory with Bitcoin right now but it's hard not to sell off at least some of my holdings in the hopes of catching the dip. I can always buy back in if they announce the rule change is approved.
@_date: 2017-03-20 06:22:58
If things were as bad as Mt. Gox then the price would be as low. Confidence is still up comparatively. You definitely weren't there, not only were the core protocols in question but the entire existence of Bitcoin and the supporting network were in question. People turned off miners because it wasn't profitable. Stop trying to scare the noobs or admit you didn't even own bitcoin 3 years ago because if you think this is anywhere close to Mt. Gox then you couldn't have seen the despair firsthand. Bitcoin meet ups (if they weren't cancelled alright) were like funerals. People were protesting in the street, law enforcement was investigating everyone and people were calling it the death of Bitcoin (again). It's not even close to that now unless you go to the other sub, which they had to start because no one here wanted to hear their panic and baseless fear. People lost homes, businesses, and families after Mt Gox. A few rich guys may lose face over this one, that's it.

Thanks for this. Well thought out, simple, and sane. I'm still thinking through the concept of allowing nodes or other entities to "vote" for, or "accept" the soft fork. It would be great to get us over this bump without forcing the miners into the fray but, on the other hand, it may open the door to new kinds of attacks. Like 50/50 node attacks or more likely something I haven't even thought of yet. Great post all the same, cheers!

Obligatory reminder that Bitcoin was premined as well. Never forget about Satoshi's Millions (Billion?) that still reside in the OG receiver address.

Everyone knows you, kid. You're the troll, finding comfort in the thought that he's making others hurt as bad as he does. What you don't realize is that you're not hurting anyone worthwhile because worthwhile people recognize a little piece of shit when they see it. The more I watch you try to get under people's skin, the better I feel about my own life. Man, how shitty must a persons life be when they find joy in this? It's a rhetorical question, I already know your life's shit. It'll keep getting shittier. And harder. 
In fact, I'm going to put a curse on you. Any time something happens to you that you think is totally unfair you're going to remember me and how I told you your life was going to keep getting shittier. In fact, from now on, every time ANYTHING goes even slightly wrong in your life, you're going to think of me and how I predicted your life would be a stinking, useless, pointless, reeking pile of shit that no one who knew better would want to live through. Now, pardon me. I'm late for my nightcap, cheers!

You know, I've seen that posted so many times that I just assumed it was true on some level but, I just took the time to verify release date and time and compare it to the blockchain time stamps when mining started and it certainly wasn't premined. I had plans to dig up the release time and mining times and prove that Satoshi took advantage of the fact that his equipment and software were already up and running and that he had been mining while everyone else was busy trying to download, install, and figure it out but...that's clearly not the case. Man, I was sooo gonna make a snarky comment too. Oh well, at least I'm wiser now. Cheers!

I think you are also miscalculating how many new users actually run full nodes. All the geeks are on the bandwagon already, now it's Aunt Judy and your cousin that can't hook up a cable box entering the game. They won't run full nodes, they'll all have Coinbase apps or buy shares in a company holding bitcoin. Those ten percent represent a decline that should not be set in motion.

You don't appear to know how a Trezor, or any other hardware wallet, works. You also don't appear to understand how the blockchain works either. I don't have time to explain but if anyone is wondering if this is true or not please visit Trezor's FAQ and see for yourself. An infected computer won't effect the transactions your Trezor makes as long as you double check the address on the computer with the one on its screen. Stop trying to scare people, it's easy to verify you don't know anything about this.

Oh man, I know you would feel so super cool if you were right but a distinction has not been made in favor of any of these woman based on their sex. To celebrate the fact that women are involved in Bitcoin is not the same as giving them a job in Bitcoin because they are women. Work on that logic, bruh. It's mighty weeeeeeeaaaaaaak!
@_date: 2017-03-09 02:04:04
The distinction is not in their favor, genius. It's just about them, it is intended to celebrate all women by calling attention to these women in this particular category that doesn't typically have a lot of women. The intent was not to get them paid, laid or otherwise compensated. If I point out that you are a man who does your job that distinction does not work for or against you, it is merely a fact. Go try to play word games somewhere else junior, my logic is strong and you can take it over to r/philosophy if you want a second opinion.

@_date: 2017-03-08 06:22:36
There is no conspiracy, people are selling into the rise to take profits, hedge against a denial and just plain cash out while they're ahead. One major hedge fund has already announced their plans to liquidate earlier in the day and I imagine others are following suit just to avoid the coming melee. Could rally again before the announcement or the announcement could come tomorrow, which apparently quite a few people believe is likely. I'm half in and half out. Smart liquidators are probably cashing out slowly so as to  startle the market as little as possible. Don't want that price dropping too much as you unload all that sweet sweet bitcoin.

Ah, once again you have reduced me to my most basic insecurities. What a master of psychological tactics you are! I am humbled and ashamed, obviously. To be scolded by such an important man who must do such great things in this far off and mysterious land called "Japan." With all of this free time you have to put poor pathetic scum like me in their place you surely must be a great man indeed! Respected and feared by those around you for who dares to tell YOU to get back to work! Yes, surely my life is much sadder than yours! After all, I am but a miserable...wait, what is it that I do again? Oh well, it must be terribly sad, whatever it is. 
But that's not important here! What's important here is the vigorous humping you will surely give those poor prostitutes tonight now that both inches of your dick stand taught and turgid in celebration of the victory you have won today against a faceless opponent on reddit.

The point of a hardware wallet is to remove direct control of your wallet from the computer in case the computer is infected with malware. It was literally designed to protect you from an instance just like this. Also, the CIA doesn't want your bitcoins, they just want to watch them.

@_date: 2017-03-09 06:03:23
I'm missing the point because you are doing a terrible job making it. Also, your "point" hinges on the assumption that every computer in the world and the entire blockchain are under the full control of the CIA, which is not likely. Believe it or not, the CIA have waaaaay bigger fish to fry than a bunch of drug addicts and dealers who are too lazy to meet in person anymore. There's not enough market cap for Bitcoin to do the kind of damage and fund the kind of organizations that show up on their radar. Maybe the FBI is dabbling in it but they would have done better to hold on to the coins from SR instead of auctioning them to Wall Street bankers if pwning the blockchain is their goal. To further demonstrate how ridiculous your point is, let's assume the CIA controls EVERYTHING. Now what? They seem to be letting us do whatever we want with it, so what does it matter in the end if their "control" has no effect on us? But that was just hypothetical, they may control a few nodes to collect data but they definitely don't run the whole network or control every computer. If the CIA was really that omnipotent they wouldn't be letting a buffoon like Trump make fools of them over and over again. You clearly don't understand the scale of what you're proposing.

You don't seem to understand what is meant by "blacklisting" in this context. There is nothing to fight, anyone that wants to can already keep a "blacklist" of any addresses they don't want to deal with. They can simply write them down on a napkin and refuse to use them if they want. So I don't understand how you are going to prevent me from writing down an address I find suspicious and refusing to do business with it. How are you going to fight that? You can't. Blacklisting is ALREADY possible and you can't stop it. Your only choice is to ignore any blacklist you come across.
Next, I'm happy to take your definition of "whole point" but it still doesn't make your case because the majority of the miners still aren't even the "main" point, they are but one feature of a system that would all be useless without the end consumer deciding to buy into it. Some of this confusion may be because you are not a native English speaker but your position still demonstrates your naivety about this topic. Stop trying to prove a useless position that demonstrates how little you understand the subject.
@_date: 2017-01-29 21:56:26
Agree. The blacklist "ratings" would need to be based on more than one angry person or spammer. There could also be a master list that overrides ratings such as wallets of trusted and secure exchanges or other transparent and legally operating businesses. Green for "safe" transaction, yellow for an address that has 1 or more reports pending investigation/corroboration and red for known scammers, thieves and otherwise dangerous wallets.

Private key, not a WIF key or public key (would have to hash for that)
Here is the method, which requires two dice or any other randomizing method.  Roll the two six sided dice 64 times.  Right down the numbers like this:
If the number is 0-9 right now the number.  If the number is 10-12 right now a-c.  Do this with each roll of the dice and you will get a valid hex private key, such as A9 87 3C 79 B6 D8 70  A0 1B 61 57 78 63 33 89 B4 45 32 13 30 3A A6 1C 20 CC 67 2C 23 36 B3 32 62
This is a valid bitcoin private key.  Note that this does not use all the hex characters, and as such can not generate all possible private keys, but its easy to do with just two dice.
You could also buy a 16 sided dice or something and use 0-F which would be more proper.  If you do it this way, the max address you can use is FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFE BAAE DCE6 AF48 A03B BFD2 5E8C D036 4141

Of course, the more I get to know you, the more I begin to suspect that those "wives" are actually poor prostitutes who gag as you sweat and flop like a fish on top of them.

There seems to be some of you who believe this is a suggestion for the Bitcoin client or something for the miners/community to adopt. The OP appears to be suggesting an alternative type of wallet that would keep track of "blacklisted" wallets/addresses. The OPs wallet would have no direct control over these addresses and only people that choose to use it would get the warnings. This does not effect how bitcoin works, it only effects how some people might choose to use it. People already keep track of addresses and make their own blacklists, this is not new. OP just wants to make those "blacklisted" addresses more accessible as info to any bitcoin users who choose to use his proposed wallet. Relax guys.

I would find this useful. I know coinbase keeps track of wallets they consider "blacklisted" and will close accounts that transact with them. Not sure if they would open up the list to the public/third parties but I'm sure there are other partial lists out there posted by angry consumers that could be combined to make a more comprehensive picture. The real feat would be to integrate real time updating and warnings of addresses as they are reported (through the wallet?) and number of confirmations of reports.

Well, I can't speak from experience about all services and exchanges but I can confirm that I have transferred BTC between Gemini, poloniex, Bitfinex, jaxx wallet, and two hardware wallets several times in the last few days without incident or delay. Perhaps these services are better options in terms of transfers these days. Not sure if that will help OP at this point but maybe others.

OMG you are sooooooo missing the point of this. The good news is that you have kept me chuckling and shaking my head all morning. Good luck out there with whatever important work it is you are getting back to. Cheers!

Gemini does ACH instant but they do require personal info/docs. Fees can be low but vary depending on how you trade.

People that like to say Bitcoin only has one point clearly don't understand Bitcoin very well. Also, you defeated your own point while attempting to make it. If the "whole point of Bitcoin" is that there are no masters except the majority of miners then an easier way to say your statement would be: "the whole point of bitcoin is that the majority of miners are the masters." Anyone with two Bitcoins to rub together can tell you that this is not the point of Bitcoin.

It looks like I could have rolled my own (minus tiny asic miner) from instructions on their page but I was curious about what they were peddling hardware wise.

So, I don't disagree but... It did occur to me as I was mulling over the uselessness of banks adopting private blockchain that there could be at least a couple of scenarios where some may find it useful.
A.) If the company consists of many small branches that weren't "trusted" by the "Main Branch." They could use an internal, immutable distributed ledger (blockchain) to prevent anyone from fudging the books locally.
B.) If a company wanted to demonstrate transparency in their internal accounting for some reason.
Admittedly these are pretty far stretches, but I only commented in order to play devils advocate.

You're not wrong, u/theymos. But let's be honest, the original sin here is attempting to do any of this by hand in the first place. It did fascinate me enough to look into it a little, though.
@_date: 2017-01-29 19:22:10
Frowned upon by who? I would like this as an option. It's not like anyone HAS to use it.
1.- So what? Lots of things that you do with bitcoin don't happen in the "cash world." This isn't a reason not to do this.
2.- The word is spelled "Fungibility." Blacklisting a wallet only impacts how people perceive addresses that transact with that wallet (and only by those who care that it's "blacklisted") so I don't see how this is an issue at all.

Oh, you had to change your user name? Sorry to hear that. Were you banned or did you just earn a bad reputation in general? Also, this all started because I just followed your logic that bitcoin had to be treated as cash and then disagreed with that assumption, not sure how that's trolling.
@_date: 2017-08-02 17:10:54
They made a day for me? Oh, sorry, I must have misheard. Wish they had a day for me... ��
@_date: 2017-01-31 21:59:41
Have been with them for 6 months and love it. Simple interface and the ability to move quickly on the market. Wish they had a bonus or affiliate program so I could get some nickels for all the business I send their way, but I'll still recommend over the other American exchanges any day. Also wish they had an app.
@_date: 2017-01-31 17:56:50
I didn't see the inbox app yet, that does sound cool. I was just trying to figure out how to "politely" monetize all the advice and help my FaceBook friends have been requesting regarding bitcoin. Between the rampant global political instability and the rising price of BTC in the news everyone is hitting me up for basic advice (they don't know what sources to trust when they google these topics) and it's been taking up a lot of my time over the past few weeks. Now I'm starting to see a wave of "friends of friends" and I would have no problem handing out an email that pays me for correspondence. Too bad they won't know how to get the BTC to pay me until after we talk, kinda creates a paradox in this instance.

Here: 
There was also some dude that put all his families savings into bitcoin right before the crash that I remember reading about but I don't have time to hunt that one down. There were probably more suicides that went unreported as being related to bitcoin because nobody irl really knew about what they were doing.

Yeah, I didn't figure any miner that could fit on a pi would churn out anything more than an occasional satoshi but it seems like this is enough to fund some of the transactions required to make their apps and API calls work. I have a pretty decent Neural Net I could hook up to it but I just don't see that much demand for a service like that and even less when you limit the audience to bitcoin adopters. TBH, I am more curious than anything else. I could have made my own from scratch with their software and instructions for like $40 but I wanted to see what the gimmick was with their own hardware.
@_date: 2017-01-30 03:06:14
Ha! Logic! By YOUR logic we shouldn't be able to transmit Bitcoin over the internet or store it in a brain wallet b/c you can't do that with cash. Why does what one does with cash have ANY bearing on what one can do with bitcoin? Does YOUR logic follow? Also, anyone that wants to can already keep a "blacklist." Coinbase does for sure.
@_date: 2016-12-22 18:57:19
I didn't just hodl through the MtGox debacle, I bought rights to coins from the shuttered MtGox through bitbuilder at a discount and then sold them months later for a profit as people speculated on a possible settlement. I would've kept them and been even happier today but they weren't really coins, just a stake in the ongoing investigation and possible settlement.
@_date: 2016-12-15 17:58:22

@_date: 2017-04-10 19:31:25
That's not even the same thing you described. This article is about hackers stealing RNG code and using it to reverse engineer private keys. Not a wallet that accidentally conjured an identical address. Those two things are not even close to the same scenario. Plus, op gained money, it wasn't stolen. You made a ridiculous proposition and now you're just trying to save face by offering the best thing a google search could give you which has nothing to do with what happened to op. Don't waste time or confuse people with this, only you can prevent FUD.
@_date: 2017-04-10 16:28:33
Lol, this is easily the least likely option by far. Even with terrible seeds/rng the odds against generating the same address are astronomical. I've never even heard of this ever being a concern.
@_date: 2017-04-10 07:13:10
Either someone who previously sent BTC to that address in your wallet made a mistake or it's chaff from a Bitcoin mixer/anonymizer that is sending some bitcoin to random addresses from the blockchain/internet in order to help conceal their actions. Either way seems like good luck for you.
@_date: 2016-09-03 06:07:17
Yeah, it boggles the mind when I really try to comprehend the sheer scale of it all. I am always super impressed by the people that can come up with this kind of code in the first place. Rats off to 'em!
@_date: 2016-09-03 04:59:11
What's frustrating about doing it that way is the use of a third party when theoretically it could be done with just one blockchain. The problem is that Bitcoin is the most widely used for payment but that makes it slower than the others but with the others you have to pay them small amounts of BTC as well in order to employ their blockchain and tokens/coins. Just wish they'd escalate frequency of transactions on BTC blockchain.
@_date: 2016-09-03 03:53:23
The last few times I sent any Bitcoin it took forever and that was with hefty fee attached. Not sure people would want to wait that long for their "like" or comment to show up.

You realize we haven't even reached the 1st yet? Why would this be the point where everything bounces back when Bitcoin hasn't even started tearing itself apart yet? The only bounces you're going to see are dead cat bounces as this is going lower. I'd suggest you either hold your cash or play in the small cheap coins like ADC, HYP and MINT (more room up than down). This is definitely not the turning point. We won't even know if Bitcoin goes to war with itself until after the first, plenty of dips to come.
@_date: 2017-05-20 18:51:05
They will be collectors items worth more whole than as their parts.
@_date: 2017-07-26 01:01:57
No way this is a recovery yet. Holding Bitcoin right now is wasting money. Sell, buy literally any of the incoming dips and you will be better off both short and long term. But I know some people don't like good advice.
@_date: 2017-07-26 00:37:15
It's an exit pump. Anyone buying now is loading up on smart moneys' bags. Sit in cash till after the first and you'll be glad.
@_date: 2017-07-26 04:17:54
Consider selling and buying cheaper. It will probably dip huge before and maybe even after. Plus, BTC-e hack and polo and mixer woes? Not a great time to be holding in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-07-26 00:41:11
It's gonna go waaaay lower before we see all time highs again.
@_date: 2017-07-26 04:56:54
If your research relies on "legends" then you are def gonna be so rich from that 1 btc. Don't worry about working for it, I'm sure holding that will make you a millionaire soon enough. And look at my dumbass over here, charting and researching and grinding away at earning each day. Shoulda just held on to that first Bitcoin and let it ride. Why, I'd be worth nearly $2600 right now! Rich I tell you!

It's best to sleep in cash when the future is uncertain. There will be plenty of opportunities to buy cheaper before this whole thing settles.

Oh no! It is *I* who must bow before *you*! Those who saw $5 Bitcoin but waited until it was more expensive to buy are surely the wisest bc they are the most patient. Good luck to you and your Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-07-26 03:52:50
You shouldn't take coins, take cash. With the fork incoming and the possible hacking of BTC-e it's not worth it to hold tight now. Buy back after the dust settles.
@_date: 2017-07-26 03:51:17
Why does everyone want to risk thousands of dollars on BTC to maybe make tens of dollars on this whatever shitcoin?
@_date: 2017-07-27 00:23:20
Maybe. Hard to say when the panic is already priced in. But I see a downward trend and a lot of confusion. With polo acting weird and btce money in limbo and all the posturing and forking nonsense it just seems too risky to me. All my experience says to wait wait this one out and buy back after there's blood on floor. When you've been around since 2012, you know what real panic looks like and I don't believe we've seen it yet. But we may yet.
@_date: 2017-07-16 18:21:04
I hate that expression. It's completely false. Humans are the first (and usually only) ones to leave a sinking ship. They use lifeboats. Rats don't even have life boats. What really happens to rats on a sinking ship is that they tear each other apart fighting over any surfaces which still remain above water.
This version actually works better though. You see the "humans" are the market makers and whales. They've already jumped to the lifeboats and all that's left on the sinking ship are the rats who have no idea what's going on and they will now tear each other to pieces in the coming panic.
@_date: 2017-07-25 23:11:54
Get out now and buy back after the next dip. At least gonna be a second leg to this drop...if not a third as well.
@_date: 2017-07-26 03:54:19
Now that BTC-e may have been hacked there is even more incentive to wait in cash until the dust settles.
@_date: 2017-07-26 03:52:00
With the fork plus the possible BTC-e hack? Better to sit in cash for now.
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:36:39
I'm sitting in cash waiting for the other shoe to drop. Should be a big one. Got my cash ready for all that sweet cheap crypto! And for all the day trader haters: I don't think Bitcoin is going anywhere, but the price is definitely going to dip and people should feel free to take advantage of price swings in this market like any other.
@_date: 2017-07-26 03:53:41
I'm more worried about the BTC-e thing. If it's hacked we're fucked. Plus the fork. I'm in cash.
