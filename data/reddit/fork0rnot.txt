I have already provided the reference video in my post, where R3CV representative is excited that NYT is going to publish Hearn's rant. Even FBI agents took money in Silk Road investigation. No wonder NYT journalists can take money too to publish articles, knowing they'd ever get caught for that.
Now you are showing double standard. You just said...


Now you are saying...


First decide what you want to establish and then keep lying about it... Goebbels theory.

Your focus was not Mike Hearn. Your focus was spread FUD about bitcoin because R3CV paid you. (Ref:  If you focused on Mike Hearn, you'd at least written a line saying that this guy said 'Ignore the longest chain' (Ref:  which fundamentally against the ethos of bitcoin. If you are left with any journalistic honesty, you'll updating the article with this info to let the world know, that Hearn has moved away from the core values of bitcoin long time ago and is never considered as a bitcoin core developer. There are many intelligent devs in the bitcoin world, who are silently contributing months after months. What an 'ex-Googler' says may matter to R3CV, but not to bitcoin.

High time majority of miners think about 2mb?

Going by Alexa, it seems like no one reads your blog.
Also, your choice of partners bewildered me. First one said [Ignore the longest chain]( Second one is [co-founder of a scam exchange]( Association with these people only devaluates your credibility.

So what does Alexa signify?

But, a self proclaimed **Core Developer**, who wanted to [ignore the longest chain]( said [Bitcoin is Dead](

Is there any chance that once XT gains traction, address blacklisting will be made part of it ?

The problem was not Gavin. It was XT based on [BIP 101]( (an inferior BIP from programmatic point of view) and his associate Mike Hearn, the wannabe benevolent dictator, who wanted to [ignore the longest chain]( The opposite group also had problems as they were mostly part of BlockStream, a company which benefits out of blocking the block size increase. This was pointed out multiple times as well. At this point of time, we are more or less convinced that block size need to increase. We have three beautiful BIPs regarding the way it should be done, namely [BIP 100]( [BIP 105]( &amp; [BIP 106]( Reddit also pointed out that BIP 100 is a pool owner's darling and it wont be logical to accept it because pool owners love it. Gavin is most welcome to provide his opinion on these three BIPs. We all thank him to make the block size stir when the price is almost at the bottom. In the long run, this would probably help the bitcoin community to grow.

That is for Player vs Player game. I was looking for feedback for Player vs House, which is running on 0% house edge.
