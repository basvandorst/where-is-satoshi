If you have a coinbase account you have a gdax account. Open GDAX, hit deposit, on the top to the far right choose deposit from coinbase account which is free. 
If you’re trying to withdraw through gdax you’ll have to verify an account by confirming two small transactions I believe.

Thanks bio! Eventually will I be FORCED to switch? 
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:23:18
Supposedly transaction fees are going to come down once more miners gain confidence in Segwit. I would just wait it out for a bit until Segwit gains traction then send them. New coin purchases I would send them to a Segwit address so you won't have to pay the fees in the future. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 15:05:54
Is Segwit a for sure thing of the future? I always feel like when they do a "fork" it's a scam! Now I have to send my coins to Segwit address and pay transaction fees. Will we have to pay the fees again in November when Segwitx2 is activated? 
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:52:11
Bitcoin is King!! Look in to litecoin and Ethereum as well. Litecoin is about $75 a coin and Ethereum is around $400. Both have been trending up consistently. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 17:31:17
Thank you for replying! Sorry for all the questions. Why would I need to send a transaction over from an exchange, how big does it have to be? 
Thanks 
Brian 
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:54:52
If you plan on sending Segwit transactions in the future and want to keep all your coins in the same wallet you should switch them now. So you won't have to pay transaction fees on the coins you're buying now. 
You can create a Segwit address, deposit new coins bought in to the Segwit wallet and spend the one in the Legacy wallet until they are all converted over. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 15:37:00
Looking for more of opinions then anything. Articles online just try to push sales to make more money. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 21:53:15
Litecoin has proven to be very stable with very quick transactions. It doesn't seem to fluctuate as much as other coins. Litecoin is accepted to purchase items in a variety of locations. I bought 5 light coins only a few months ago at $35 per coin. Today it was up to $75 per coin. Most of the money I invest is in bitcoin, just a little in altcoins. Altcoins such as Litecoin and Ethereum could offer a very good return in the future if one can really make a run at the clear cut  coin behind bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:50:38
Good start! I would suggest an external wallet, Trezor or Ledger. 
Just buy what you can afford and it'll start to build up. Try not to watch the price to much as it will fluctuate quite a bit. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 17:41:23
Perfect!! Exactly what I was looking for! Thanks man!! 
@_date: 2017-08-28 15:07:03
I have Ledger (which supports Segwit) and am hesitant to switch over. If something goes wrong or it's not accepted I'll have to pay to send it back again. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 16:22:57
So on my Ledger Nano I would have two wallets? When I plug it in it asks if i want Legacy or Segwit. From my understanding if I pick Segwit I'll need to send my coins to a new Segwit address? 
Thanks 
@_date: 2017-08-27 17:18:26
Thanks for the response! If I choose Segwit what would my next steps be? I read somewhere that I'd have to send transactions to Segwit? Could I somehow lose my coins if I didn't do something correct? Just trying to understand this before I jump in to it. 
Thanks again!

@_date: 2017-11-02 00:34:46
I went through the exact thing last fork. I was waiting for my Ledger to arrive while the fork was going on. I ended up putting my coins in a different online wallet when I should have just keep them in coinbase. At time things appeared to get hairy on coinbase but in the end there was no issue with coinbase or the online wallet I choose. I did end up paying a decent amount in tx fees. In my opinion leaving them in coinbase through the fork until your ledger arrives would be your best option.

@_date: 2017-09-02 23:07:01
I can only speak on the Ledger S Nano, which is external. Ledger S Nano gives you the option when you set it up to choose Legacy or Segwit. 
I was very impressed when I switch over from Legacy to Segwit. I noticed a huge difference in the transaction fees and time. They were more then cut in half, both fees and time. 
I'm sure you can find a list of online free wallets that will accept Segwit. You should really consider a external wallet. Much more secure and user friendly. When a "fork" comes up you won't be scrambling to remove you coins from certain wallets. Last fork I had a little scare thinking I could lose my coins. Same day I bought a Ledger S Nano online for $79.99. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:45:51

Correct me if I wrong but bitcoin avg transaction fees are $8+? 
How could it possibly be low enough to be useful? Amazon has 5 million transactions a month, at $8 that's a lot of money for Amazon.  once miners head back over from BCH they will drop, that's why BCH fees are .30 cents right now? Just trying to piece things together. Thanks

Oh and OP you can always make a paper wallet. Much cheaper but not as safe. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 23:44:37
-The only graph that has any value for fee estimation is the bottom one.  
This graph is valuable because of those almost perfectly vertical lines, or the horizontal line? Which indicate the start of a new block? Why is that important or relevant, a new block = less transactions which leads to lower fees? 
-First of all, I would recommend resetting the graph to use the 2 hour view, rather than 24 hour.  
This will allow me to see it better and in more detail? 
-First of all, just to get it out of the way, segwit will start to increasingly mess with this, by having the number be larger than 1MB.  Right now it's only a few KB extra per block, but over time, that will grow until blocks may be 1.5-1.7MB or possibly even more.
This is because Segwitx2? 
-Secondly, of course, there's no guarantee that a block will be found "right now".  Or soon.  Or even not soon. 
Are there any signs that could help me identify this, or just watching it trend? 
-Let's say you have a transaction at X sat/B, and there are 7000kB of transactions above that rate in the pool.  You can estimate that it will be at least 7 blocks before your transaction clears
1 block = 1 MB = 1024kb so roughly 7 blocks? I think I've read somewhere little as 10 minutes to mine a block and solo mining on avg 24 hours depending on the number of mines and CPU power?   (These answers could be and probably will be completely off)
Don't mind my ignorance on some of my answers, those a just a guess. If you could clarify, explain and add it would be much appreciated. I just bookmarked it to my home page, I'm going to keep a close eye on it. 
Thank you!

Awesome information, tough to get nowadays especially on Bitcoin topic! What do you think is the greatest threat to bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:35:06
If you're trading** which most don't. For most, bitcoin is an investment. People need to be patient. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:28:32
It really is.. you want to minimize you loss and maximize your gain. With that said one bad trade can be discouraging 
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:02:16
Definitely seems weird. Every time I've sent, as you said it'll charge you the transfer ($800) plus the fee. Honestly I don't have an answer but if you figure it out please post here. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 01:40:10
-It's always dubious to think about fees in terms of fiat, because the bitcoin value of a given amount of fiat is constantly changing.
No Kidding things change fast! You can't sleep on bitcoin or it'll pass ya up it seems! As mentioned earlier about the block size will change, obviously BTC fluctuates, blocks are changing constantly, new wallets (side note have you seen ZAP Wallet LN), new exchanges, new coins and it's goes on.. crazy! 
-But in general, yes, you have the basic math right.  226 bytes is also the right number for a transaction that has 1 input, and 2 outputs, (destination and change). 
Kinda lost me here. 1 input, and 2 outputs, so the 1 input would be destination and the 2 outputs ? 
-Each transaction that you've received is a separate bit of coin, and if you have to use multiple bits of coin to make up enough to cover how much you're trying to send, that will make the transaction, and the fees, larger.  You're always paying for how much space you're actually going to use for your transaction on the blockchain.
Is there anyway to group them back together once you have them all in your wallet? You could resend them all as one, but that obviously wouldn't make since. (If trying to get them back on one code would work) . That's some good insight on multiple code, I'm sure it takes up much more space. 
-It's also important to understand (contrary to how terribly so many wallets display this information), that "slow" and "fast" are relative to what's going on in the mempool at any given moment.  For example, right now, because its the weekend, and things are not busy, the mempool is virtually empty, and 32 sat/B would effectively guarantee you that you would get into the next block.  Super fast.  10 sat/B would probably confirm in 1-2 blocks even.
Speaking of the Mempool, you said I want to be behind the new block as close as possible? If I have it right, is it because you can't get in a block once it started? (Feel like I have that backwards lol) 
- However, at the peak heaviest times in the week, even 280 sat/B may not be enough to be "fast".  That fee rate may wait hours... dozens of blocks, and 32 sat/B may wait all week until things are quiet on the weekend again.  It depends.  You always have to look and take into account what's actually happening.
If it's waiting for confirmation the value of the coin still fluctuates but do wallets or exchanges honor prices? It's a fast pace currency that'll keep you on your toes. 
(On a side note) If my Ledger Wallet broke and or lost how is it possible to recover it. It's an external wallet, is there a trace in their system. I have the recovery information as they instructed. Just don't see how it's recoverable. I've seen hard drives crash to where you couldn't recover any data off of it. 
THANK YOU!!!

"Although there is nothing that can stop a government or central bank from banning Bitcoin (&amp; a few have already done so), most would not go that far for two reasons:
The Streisand effect
A ban on Bitcoin is difficult to enforce
The Streisand effect
In 2003, Barbra Streisand sued a photographer (for violation of privacy) for displaying a photograph of her Malibu, California, home in one of the photographers, 12,000 other photos of the California coastline that were taken to illustrate coastal erosion. The picture had at that point been downloaded a total of six times, two of which were by Streisand's lawyers. The suit had the unintended consequence of drawing attention to the photograph, which suddenly became wildly popular and was rapidly copied to multiple mirror sites outside the immediate reach of US law. Her $50 million lawsuit was eventually dismissed under the anti-SLAPP provisions of California law. As a result of the case, public knowledge of the picture increased substantially; more than 420,000 people visited the site over the following month.
Similarly, an attempt to ban Bitcoin by a government or a central bank can have the unintended consequence of making  it even more popular especially among a demographic that had previously never heard of Bitcoin
A ban on Bitcoin is difficult to enforce
Bitcoin has no centre to attack. There is no single organisation or person that controls Bitcoin and transactions don't go through a central clearing house there is really no way a regulator can stop people from downloading Bitcoin wallets and sending each other bitcoins. If there we to block all the websites that people can download Bitcoin wallets from, new ones will come up and some people will compile their own wallets from source code - Bitcoin is like Bittorrent is that respect. If they shut down the internet, people will send each other Bitcoin via SMS and if they shut down the electricity supply, people will use solar and battery-powered solutions." - Kembo

I ALWAYS transfer right away. When you least expect it something could happen. There have been cases of online wallets committing fraud which resulted in immediate loss of coins. Panic when the wallets system needs updated. It's best just to keep your own wallet secure. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 14:17:39
To determine that you need to look at the Mempool. 
If your not in a hurry you can get lower fees but they will be slower transactions 
@_date: 2017-09-02 22:01:38
Are you on Segwit? Yesterday I was send $1000 transactions to Segwit and it was only taking 1-2 minutes. Granted my fees were a little higher then yours $.55. I don't mind waiting, no hurry on my end. I'll take your advice next time! You paid next to nothin, nice work!! ��

THANK YOU! Man you're full of valuable information!! I did a few calculations just to get a better idea. Is this along the right lines? One would be a slow and other fast trans. Now I'm going to watch the graphs for awhile til I get a good grasp on it. Also I can mess around and create transactions and then just remove then/not send them to get a better feel for it? 
Slow tx 
32 sat/b    
X 226 =7323 sat
Fast tx 
280 sat/b 
X226 = 63,200 sat

Think about Alt-Coins as well. Focus most of your investment on Bitcoin BTC and a small amount on Alt-Coins such as Ethereum and Litecoin. They are higher risk, in my opinion but could yield a good return as well for a "late bloomer".  Also consider a external wallet such a Ledger to keep your codes safe.

1. The government can't "Shut down" bitcoin. For one as stated before it's anonymous. Secondly it's world wide, the US doesn't have the power to shut it down.

2. As stated below, pay your taxes. It makes the world go around.

You can always choose a free online Wallet but I would recommend a external wallet such as Ledger. Which costs roughly $80. Well worth the piece of mind and security. If your not looking to spend to much look in to paper keys. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 11:31:11
Ok 
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:52:47
Bitcoin is best. litecoin in a close second! Check out coinbase for purchasing if your country supports it. Also check out an external wallet to store your keys, Ledger or Trezor.

Yes there are the wallet you're sending it out of, coinbase for example would charge you. Once you get it in your external wallet you can manually enter the fees and get very low transaction rates $0.30-$0.60 per transaction on Segwitx2
@_date: 2017-09-03 01:49:04
-You need to pay enough to be in one of those layers to get into the next 1mb the top.
So if you're in a block with a Mempool size of 2000kb, you need to be in the top half (paying more then 50% of the people in that block) to get confirmed? Otherwise you get moved up to the next block? 
-The sharp line down is when a block is found and the disappeared transactions are confirmed.
Can you get in a block once they have started mining or you have to wait til the next one. Any benefit to getting into the block just before it starts, right when it starts or towards the end (if you can) 
@_date: 2017-09-02 10:22:15

Here's a little tip. If you buy from coinbase you can send to their (coinbase)exchange, GDAX for a very low fee. Then you can send out of GDAX exchange to your wallet for free. You won't need to make a GDAX account, you use your coinbase but you need to verify your GDAX account. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:45:13
I really like Litecoin. Their technology is ahead of most. They have Lightening Network, Which allows you to transfer fast and at a low price. Also they have some big upgrades in the works such as iMessage pay. 
Bitcoin you can't go wrong, it might dip a little more but you wouldn't notice it use you're buying and trading. 
ETH is going to be going through TWO hardforks in September, if you time that right it could be a profitable move. Most say it won't fluctuate due to the fork but I disagree. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 01:40:44
Send it to GDAX and try from there. It's free to send from coinbase to GDAX. Also cheaper to send out of GDAX vs coinbase.

The thing about Ethereum is that it is not just a digital currency. It is a blockchain-based platform with many aspects. It features smart contracts, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and it uses its currency called ether for peer-to-peer contracts. Plus so much more!! 
Litecoin has been stable as well. Litecoin has lightening network with allows for many more transactions per second, plus Litecoin has very low fees. Also LItecoin is soon going to offer payment via iMessage soon!!!

Me being in the states and using a credit card for $99 it's $3.95
For $33 it's $1.95
So you can save $2 by doing 1 transaction instead of 3. I like to have a diverse portfolio though. That would be your call if you wanted to do 1 or 3 transactions, if you go 1, put it in bitcoin.

It defeats the purpose of bitcoin!  It's supposed to be low transaction fees and fast. I have been hesitant to send mine to Segwit. I need to see it more established before I commit. Plus once more miners move back over from Bitcoin Cash they should come down a lot more, I hope. Right now it's ridiculous how expensive it is to send bitcoin. You'll never see it go mainstream with $8 transaction fees. Amazon would laugh at that. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 23:28:01
I don't see why not I've had many different keys. If you picked Segwit theyll be in that wallet. Send a small transaction and see. Be sure to adjust your fees so you're not paying more then you have to if you can in your android app 
@_date: 2018-02-09 00:41:10

Yesterday I tinkered with Segwit and Legacy. I found by manually inputting my transaction fee I was about to get a fee of around $.50 for sending over $1000USD in BTC! Much cheaper then I was paying, plus it was plenty quick enough, just a few minutes

@_date: 2017-09-03 00:22:52
Yes you can, you'll need to create a Segwit wallet then send them from Legacy to Segwit. Be sure to manually input your fees, if you wallet allows it.  You can save a lot in transaction fees. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 21:55:28
No you'll be fine!! Don't just sit there and watch the ticker tho.. drive yourself insane lol.. just let bitcoin do its thing. It might go lower but it'll definitely go higher! 
@_date: 2017-09-10 03:16:22
Storing on coinbase can be risky, any online wallet is risky. Ledger is and external wallet that allow you to store private keys where your money is only accessible to you. By sending the keys to your wallet then removing it from your PC it becomes very secure. Also linked by recovery words if it was lost or damaged so you can retrieve your coins. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 23:36:10
What is really low? I think fees are outrageous, and it's holding bitcoin back from its real potential.

With Ledger they give you a 24 word passphrase that can recover your wallet if lost, stolen, crashed or any other failure. 
I only have experience with Ledger, which has been a good one. I've also heard good things about Trezor as well. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 11:19:29
So how much for .017?
@_date: 2017-09-01 21:33:54
Exactly!!! Most people do the opposite. They sell at a dip and panic buy when it's soaring. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 11:17:21
Not a troll thanks tho! 
@_date: 2017-09-03 03:22:39
Because it's an exchange. Which also deals with FIAT money such as the US dollar. The dollar is ALWAYS at risk for inflation. Which in my opinion bring down the value. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:21:46
Haha you mad bro!! How much did you lose on BTC in the last week?? ��
@_date: 2017-09-09 09:43:52
I don't think there is a china ban! It's a quick money grab. Here's an article from Reuters about there not being a ban.

I think you deposit those in your bank?
@_date: 2017-09-03 00:04:26
-Mine will not accept transactions paying less than 0.0001 tx fee so all that 0-5 sats per byte shit won't be there.
Is there usually a minimum they will confirm if you catch them at a good time, 10, 20, 50? (Which is right before a block?)
-The more telling chart is the bottom one, showing cumulative size. Switch to 2 hour view. Only up to ~1MB of transactions can be confirmed per block, so the top layer, paying the highest fees, will almost always confirm first. If you want your transaction to confirm within 1 or 2 blocks (10-20 min) you want to pay at least the fee per byte that corresponds to the color slice within the top 1MB. 
So the big thing this chart would be predicting is when a new block is coming? This being the most important chart, predicting when the block hits is the most important part of Mempool? 
Thanks for the help, I really appreciate it! Sorry if some of my responses are ignorant, still learning! 
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:05:35
Yes but with a small fee from coinbase it'll be a little less then $33. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 18:45:01
Believe me I've learned my lesson!! Not so much loosing $35 but have to deal with him all day!! Not worth my time. I have created an account of Localbitcoin. I was looking for people in my area but they all wanted $5000 per coin. Still trying to figure out how to navigate Localbitcoin 
@_date: 2017-09-02 22:03:44
Any chance you could explain or breakdown the mempool. Im still New2coin and not exactly sure what I'm looking at. Thanks! 
@_date: 2018-02-09 00:52:23
So is bitcoin BCH? 
@_date: 2017-09-02 05:33:42
This transaction was about 7 hours ago. From the data I put in Ledger $.55 was much cheaper then anything else I saw. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 07:32:17
Sorry for my ignorance, CAD? 
@_date: 2017-09-10 03:05:55
Varies from person to person. My personally I don't trade unless I'm trading BTC for other altcoins. I don't use BTC to purchase items but that's just me. A lot of other do buy and sell. I just slowly add to mine and try not to pay attention to the price. I would recommend a hardware wallet such as a Ledger or Trezor to store your keys, it's much more secure then an online wallet or exchange . 
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:54:51
If I was spending 100 right now I'd split it between the 3 from purchasing on coinbase. They are all low right now, all will bounce back soon. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 22:17:09
So as of 14:00 you can send with a minimal transaction fee, around 5-10 sat/b and it would most likely get confirmed? 
If it didn't get confirmed can you cancel at any time and up your fee? 
Thank you for the explanation! Starting to catch on. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 22:47:51
You got ripped off!! Don't EVER send anything without getting something first. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 21:09:38
Wasn't trying to be funny.. 
Your on a bitcoin page "just listen me out". Then the post is irrelevant to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 08:45:44
Do you have any numbers to support this? It hasn't dropped more then $400 after climbing in a few months. Now I'm hearing it'll drop nearly $2000. Doesn't add up to me. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 11:07:03
Honestly just get a external wallet. I bought a Ledger S Nano for $75 and it well worth the money. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 19:57:58
Every weekend I think I could go to the bar or spend the $100 on coins! Coins win nearly every time! Unless the bar wins then bitcoin usually wins too. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:31:56
Watch!! You're nearly down $1000 since Friday.

What is the best way to send through paypal, I read NOT as friends and family 
@_date: 2017-09-01 21:27:13
FACT: Gold has been around since mid 1800's. Bitcoin has been around since 2009. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:38:21
Can you change the fee in Exodus? Most wallets will allow you to change the fee. The conformation might be slower, but much cheaper 
@_date: 2018-02-09 00:53:55
99% of the people there think BCH is bitcoin!! And BCH has lower fees!! They can steal our sub, hold it down while we are saying it’s not worth it!! I see why people are making the jump!! We’re dying!! 
@_date: 2017-09-01 23:41:16
Not bad!! Now $5 will get you close to .0001 lol so I think you did good! To bad ya didn't buy more but that $5 is worth $1800 or so now so I see why ya want them! 
@_date: 2017-09-09 15:43:29
I'm guessing that app is coinbase. You can create an account at coinbase then purchase with credit card in the USA. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 00:32:51
Not true!!! 
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:47:11
Once you buy from coinbase, which is high. Download GDAX, transfer from coinbase to GDAX for free then GDAX to you're wallet with minimal fees. No way around the coinbase that I know of. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 10:59:50
Paypal is safe. You can file a dispute with PayPal if there was an issue and they back you. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:16:36
I had no issue. I used this as an excuse to buy, it works ��
@_date: 2017-09-09 16:18:27
Haha yeah man no worries! Take a look at a few coins, get an idea what they're about and go with your gut and you'll be fine!

Oh definitely.. I'm 100% honest and legit. He's from the U.K. Would getting a photo I'd or two sent to me matter or not worth all that over $70? 
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:46:35
Good points 
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:36:59
Watch the trends and make a decision for yourself. If you buy as an investment you'll be fine! 
@_date: 2017-09-09 20:03:17
I believe your wallet has to have that option, what Wallet are you using? 
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:33:58
Good timing!! Buy BtC, ETH and LTC.
@_date: 2017-09-02 11:05:45
When will this dip start? You're heading in the wrong direction.

So the more they spam the faster Segwit and lightning will improve? Are they better at fighting off spam attacks? Sorry for my ignorance. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:49:43
People spreading a lot of FUD (Fear, uncertainty and doubt). No way bitcoin drops to $2000. 3 years in this "area" is a ridiculous statement. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 01:07:32
Favorite part so far is in the beginning they are asking some older lady’s if they know how bitcoin works. “Day your coin is worth $150. Do you just go to the grocery store and give them your number and they subtract it?” ��
@_date: 2017-09-08 23:16:58
I think the biggest problem for most is getting verified!
@_date: 2017-09-02 11:23:00
I've never bought online before without using a wallet or exchange. How does the whole transaction go down? 
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:17:34
Not being scammed.. but the fees are ridiculous!! 
@_date: 2017-09-01 23:34:55
Mine are in Legacy and will stay in Legacy. I don't trade or send, unless it's new coins. I still have decided if I want to put new coins in Segwit or stick with Legacy. I'd like to keep up but not sure I want to wallets in Ledger, one for Legacy and one for Segwit. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:46:58
I just haven't seen it drop $1500 in a week before 
@_date: 2017-09-02 11:04:39
Not only has it not dipped it went up from your last post.. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 11:49:28
There are sights you can use to make a paper wallet or do it yourself. I like my Ledger Nano S. It’s easy to use, hold a good variety (not good enough yet tho) of coins, it’s VERY secure. If lost, stolen or damaged your coins can always be recovered with the passphrase. I also have a Ledger HW.1, if your storing ONLY btc or bch I would consider the HW.1. The Trezor has good reviews to but I haven’t used it yet. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 08:21:33
As far as tips and tricks
1. Get an external wallet 
2. Buy from a coin exchange such as GDAX
3. When sending bitcoin make sure you adjust the fees. Example: My external wallet a Ledger will set the fees by default at high. So the transaction will go through quicker, not much quicker. So be sure to get a wallet that will allow you to adjust. 
4. Be sure to put your coins in to a Segwit address if you have the option. 
5. Check out Alt-coins as well but focus on bitcoin 
6. Don't price watch to much. Just check in every once in awhile unless you plan on trading. 
Do your research it could pay off, literally. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:34:19
That's how I feel. I bet when the Silk Road got shut down there was a new Silk Road the next day. The FBI seized 140,000 bitcoins if I'm not mistaken. I understand that's far from 21 million but over time coins could start to disappear in numbers that could affect bitcoin? Thoughts? 
@_date: 2017-09-02 01:08:24
I see A LOT of that! Seems like people are usually trying to push a coin or are anti coin!
I can't seem to get an answer on this question anywhere, maybe you can help: BTC is avg $8+ per transaction and BCH is avg $.30 per transaction. Is this information correct and if so, why and how could they be so different? I found that information here  . Maybe I'm not understanding it correctly? 
@_date: 2017-09-10 07:57:23
No if you lose it you use the recovery words and bring it up on a new device. If you use an online wallet and it gets hacked or gets caught doing fraud like BTC-E.. then you're screwed 
@_date: 2017-09-02 11:07:36
If the OP is selling!
@_date: 2017-09-02 09:13:58
Add 3 of mine to the list. I was very surprised to see the lower fees and quicker transactions on Segwit. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:22:32
Lots of good information!! Nice! One of my main concerns for bitcoin is the darkweb being shut down. I don't have any numbers to support my opinion I just feel bitcoin relies heavily on the darkweb. I didn't think about the government creating their own coin. Would it be a USA only coin or world wide like bitcoin(if they did)? 
@_date: 2017-09-16 15:15:07
I've sent first using paypal.. got ripped off. Was able to get my money back tho since I didn't send it through friends and family 
@_date: 2017-09-09 00:44:31
I'm not 100% sure BUT from the research I've done I have found 0 creditable evidence to support the claim that china is banning exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 23:28:48
Depending on the coins Bittrex is probably best. Others like GDAX only allow you to trade ETH, BTC and LTC. Sometimes you’ll have to switch exchanges depending on the coin. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 23:29:05
Good question! I would be able to recover my bitcoin, I think. I have it stored on a Ledger with a recovery option. As far as Gold and silver I don't have much so I'd carry it out (if I had time) ��
@_date: 2017-09-02 07:02:45
So rather then use coinbase to purchase you use a trading site? Coinbase charges crazy about amounts. I usually buy $100-$200 a week on my credit card. What site would give me the lowest fees? 
@_date: 2017-09-02 08:49:21
That's kind of my point.. it's almost always at an all time high now. I think it going up before it goes down. You'll always be chasing coins. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 08:13:59
To sell bitcoin create a GDAX account, link your bank account, sell bitcoin, withdraw money to bank account. I think it allows you to link your paypal account too. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 20:42:07
���� when I saw it I got excited!! Just bought some more BTC. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 14:14:16
Yes Trezor or Ledger is the way to go. I have a Ledger but also considering a Trezor. My Ledger has limited space for apps for I have to delete and add them often. How many apps can you put on a Trezor, if that's how it works. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 18:28:07
Not good �� I sent $35, it got converted down so it was $29 when he got it. He wouldn't send the coin and we couldn't agree on a price so I had to file a claim with PayPal. I should receive my money back in 10 days.. they were nice and understanding at paypal. I tried to work with him, meet in the middle on things that went bad but he was tough to reason with. I'm glad it was only $35! I've learned my lesson without losing to much money. I don't know if he was ever going to send the coins to being with, have a feeling he wasn't. 
It was $29 so I wanted him to send .006 bitcoin before I sent more money and he wouldn't do it. Once again I doubt he even had any coin. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 23:45:42

That is the wrong thought process if you ask me. Go to work everyday and spend what you can. I'd hate to invest in bitcoin if the clock was ticking. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 22:19:51
If I switch over to the 2 hours on the site the unconfirmed transactions are going up so I'd have to up my fee, correct?
Right now there is nearly 1200 unconfirmed transactions? If I reading it right. Is there a guide or cheat sheet to look at to tell if that's a lot? 
@_date: 2017-09-15 21:18:59
Darkweb!!!
