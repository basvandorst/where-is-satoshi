Can you teach me? Or at least start a YouTube channel to teach fellow traders how to pull profits.

Must protect my BTC. Never give out your city or town.

Venmo 
@_date: 2019-03-10 18:43:51
Haha you got it
@_date: 2019-03-11 12:37:09
Is also a faster transaction to use Venmo in comparison to PayPal.

The restaurant accepts it as payment though.

Would’ve used my BTC. Been trying to get my binance pass back for awhile though since I lost my phone... which had my info...

Not exactly lol. It’s sort of like PayPal, but addressed to more of a “friend group” instead of a larger audience.

Maybe he’s comparing it to Venezuela’s economy. In that case you could probably buy the country with one BTC

I was expecting a blowjob. I’m unsatisfied with his software and his word.

I switched to SPY options when it started sinking. Lost a lot of money playing that dip though... wasn’t a panic sell. Just bad placement.

Mine just has doge coin. ��

He’ll always have his hard on for BTC though.
@_date: 2019-02-23 01:34:17
I expect a blowjob. And a bitcoin. More in favor of a bitcoin, though.

A friend told me about it in 2012. Thought about buying some BTC with a prepaid Walmart Visa card, ended up buying a runescape membership instead.

Good advice man. Will definitely be putting money back in here and just letting it sit.

In 20-40 years there’s going to be movies about Bitcoin and how it revolutionized currency. These days are making history, folks. It’ll be awesome to look back and be proud that we were apart of it.

Thanks! Appreciate it!

What is the two step authentication procedure? How do you obtain the 6 digit key?
@_date: 2019-04-03 21:44:45
John McAfee, you might not have to eat your dick after all. We’re still far away though.

Considering there were really no ATMs in 2016 and there's only a handful ATMS now, 700% isn't really that high.

Oh hi Mark
