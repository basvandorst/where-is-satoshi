If you express any doubts about bitcoin (even rational criticism based on observation) you are inviting a torrent of downvotes in this sub. I mean there's people arguing that this current news from China is great news. Seriously??
I'm not sure if it's because there's shady characters lurking here trying to perpetuate the idea that bitcoin is going up no matter what, or that people bought too much bitcoin in recent months (relative to their net worth, i.e. speculating with money they can't afford to lose), and are currently running around with their fingers in the ears screaming LA-LA-LA. 
For the record, I like bitcoin *the protocol*, but have serious doubts about the current bitcoin implementation. See another comment of mine here:

Bitcoin has its [shoe shine boy giving stock tips]( moment. Get out while you can.

While the fact that bitcoin isn't banned outright is good, the Chinese authorities have put in rules to prevent bitcoin becoming awkward/impossible to use as a currency, which is supposed to be bitcoin's raison d'etre in the first place. 
Now it will be purely a tool of speculation/means to circumvent the Chinese currency controls, which **is not** good long term, no matter how tries to spin this news. If it's not good as a currency, then that's all you have left.
That way it was supposed to work is that you go onto an ecommerce store and have the option to pay in bitcoin. Now the Chinese government have said "no, you can only pay in official fiat currency".
This is reaction to BTC price movements:
* Bitcoin shoots up (due to speculation, not due to increased transaction volume of legal trade) ==&gt; proof that bitcoin is going to take over
* Bitcoin plunges ==&gt; EhrMahGerd, **BUYING OPPORTUNITY**
There's so much utter bullshit on this sub it's ridiculous. 
**Far** more cool-headed, rational discussion [here]( on hacker news.
