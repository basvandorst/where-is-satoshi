I got a lot of bitcoins, no love though... can't say I'm happy with that arrangement :\
@_date: 2018-01-29 06:47:38
The solution is to either keep your BTC holding private, or to diversify your btc holdings to something they can't rob, like a house. Then you can sell the house in case you get robbed, and get back some BTC

He might be able to recover them, formatting doesn't delete the actual data... Try a recovering software, because a wallet file is so small, that there's a good chance it's still there and wasn't overwritten
@_date: 2019-07-02 06:55:50
I can't afford one more dip, let alone a sip
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:55:21
Actually, if you follow the trail from that "1" btc he had kept, you get to this address that had over 60,000 BTC:
And this address sent some to other addresses that seem to be active all the way to 2016
So I think he's still very well off
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:31:40
in my Android phone I turned off the automatic updates for the bitcoin wallet app, for the same reason as you described.

I was talking about his daughter, obviously, who enslaved those harmless cows. Yet you choose to live in ignorance.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:17:31
cool story but he's too smart about money to be that stupid with money. I'm pretty sure he was wealthy before (he's a software engineer for over 20 years, single his whole life..) and I'm pretty sure he has 20K+ BTC stashed. But he has to tell this story for his own protection, so people won't try to kidnap him and get him to give up the coins. That's why it's important to buy some other assets with your coins, cuz bitcoins can be ransomed much too easily.
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:58:48
Technically, the wallet doesn't "have to" use a change address, but they do as a way to increase privacy and basically "jumble" the transaction addresses.
With blockchain.info for example, you can import a prv key and use it to send bitcoins, and it will send them without using a change address, keeping the remaining bitcoins in the original prv key without emptying it.
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:09:21
Better to send the funds from that prv key to an address that's part of your seed. That way you don't have to keep thinking about that single prv key in the future when you move between wallets.

Is Gilbert Gottfried their father?
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:46:53
Actually, if he had sent all the money at once, he wouldn't have had this problem, because nothing would get sent to a change address...
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:08:06
no, the seed wallets came after 2013
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:59:07
it makes no sense for people to hurt themselves, as you put it. It's better for most people to keep their funds private.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:22:27
you don't need symmetry. *the* pin means there's only 1 pin, and it is bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-01 17:58:01
Why do u think people won't fork if it's for their own benefit...
@_date: 2018-08-01 17:59:15
LN is anonymous already because it uses Onion routing.. so.. Bitcoin wins again
@_date: 2018-08-02 06:18:40
No u can't see the address, that's the point
@_date: 2018-08-01 17:46:17
Using Bulletproof in Bitcoin is better because it includes all the other benefits of Bitcoin (such as scalability). And Bitcoin WILL be fungible this way. That's the whole point, dude. And it will be safe to use. That's the whole point, man. And it will be accepted because it's obviously better, so stop whining and accept Bitcoin's value as the first and biggest open source blockchain.
@_date: 2018-08-01 18:26:42
Fine, let the black market stuff use Monero.. Bitcoin still has more than 99.99% of tx globally
@_date: 2018-08-01 17:12:49
Bitcoin has Bulletproof protocol in development, so it will be better than Monero it terms of privacy. This is the magic of open source, you can never make an open source technology that's better, because the better things will always be implemented in Bitcoin. That's why I don't go for alts at all.
@_date: 2018-08-01 18:20:04
It's fungible enough.. that's all we really need for it to be common money...
@_date: 2018-08-02 14:49:41
No it won't always be transparent. And if it's transparent, it doesn't matter, because the LN tx is still anonymous. There are many tx's on LN channel before it closes.
@_date: 2018-05-29 16:09:49
Oh I see, so the second halving was between the end of 2012 till mid 2016, which is really 3.5 years apart. So it's not exactly every 4 years, and that's why the other halving dates don't divide into 4 years nicely
@_date: 2018-05-29 14:07:56
Still doesn't make sense, because mining started at 2009..
@_date: 2018-05-25 03:12:21
Can someone please explain how I can send myself payment as a test? I created an account on their website, and I also have the eclair wallet installed on my phone with a lightning channel open that contains 0.0014 BTC
Now how do I mimic a store that accepts lightning payment coming from my phone? Where do I create an address in this new Strike website?
@_date: 2018-05-29 13:53:44
I thought it happens every 4 years. Last time was in 2017.. so next time should be 2021, no?
@_date: 2019-03-16 01:37:38
I have a version installed before Segwit was enabled, if I upgrade will I be forced to transfer all the coins to Segwit addresses?
@_date: 2019-03-16 13:07:59
Thanks but I actually have a different question, will my wallet seed change after upgrading to the segwit version (version 3)? I saw somewhere that segwit uses a different seed to create the addresses.. so upgrading will make all my seed backups null?
@_date: 2019-03-28 09:41:44
Great but it's for US only...
@_date: 2019-03-16 15:54:57
Thank you! :)
@_date: 2019-03-20 22:59:26
This is huge actually. I've been waiting for this.. the only problem is that immediatly after paying I got an error that "the operator" didn't get the payment, so now I have to wait till it's cleared from their end, whatever that means.
@_date: 2019-11-12 12:34:48
Airbnb gift cards can only be used inside the US. And we already have bitrefiill providing this service. But nice to see some competition.. wish they made Airbnb alternative for non-US folks

If this was 2011 that would've been interesting... Time's changed, everyone knows about Bitcoin. The next step is to believe it

Underrated comment
@_date: 2019-11-24 18:10:26
Since lightning, segwit adoption is no longer important...
@_date: 2019-11-25 08:26:38
Yeah but you don't need more adoption at this point... Just like you don't need more hashing power... Of course more is better, but it's no longer a concern for a huge influx of transactions
@_date: 2019-03-16 13:14:22
How exactly? Can you please elaborate? Isn't version 3 with segwit enabled?
@_date: 2019-11-21 13:09:13
So sell the top and become a tax slave?
As long as the current system of banks and governments exist, there is no point in reaching that "top".
I'm saying this as someone who has already reached his "moon". HODL or die mofos!
@_date: 2018-10-16 11:46:59
it's asking for my recovery phrase for some reason.. I think it's a scam.
The game should let me send it money via LN, not ask for my wallet seed.
@_date: 2018-06-24 11:29:33
The use of "watchtowers", so we can receive money without having a node that's always online. When we'll be able to receive LN payments with our smartphones, that'll be the big bang for the next level.
@_date: 2018-06-12 18:21:26
This is the definitive answer I was looking for to understand why Ethereum can't deliver on its promises... These "smart" contracts are simply impossible to be trustless as Vitalik is trying to sell us. You always need a third party involved when it comes to property that isn't digital.
@_date: 2018-06-10 08:25:12
True BTC believers, mostly made up of sophisticated folks,  hold the coins, while speculators sell them. So the money is going to the right places, voluntarily.
@_date: 2019-08-29 22:43:49
Get rid of your US citizenship otherwise you still have to pay taxes, even while living in a different country
@_date: 2018-06-22 10:59:59
more importantly, don't keep all your coins in the same wallet.. so even if you do lose a wallet somehow, you still have most of the coins.
@_date: 2018-06-13 02:02:05
You just solved a problem that doesn't exist

Yes. Already did 2 years ago. Don't care about volatility cuz I live a minimalist life style. Also it's fun knowing I can create a global dip if I wanted to... Sense of power haha

This is perfect, because airbnb don't even accept cash, so I'm really stuck with all my bitcoins in terms of affordable long term travel options. Finally a solution is in the making!
btw, I'd move the currency used (ETH, BTC..) to the top of the page, not the bottom
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:19:24
These beliefs may hurt you financially... It's the market that gets to decide which coin wins, not our beliefs..

They should have a public address so it's clear how much money is invested in the project. They're taking vacations at these crucial times, so I'm not going to anonymously send them money. They (or anyone else who wants to make money) should develop the project with full transparency.
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:20:32
dude, "it's incentive based and an ever increasing value is a necessary incentive" - that you saying the increasing value of bitcoin (being more valuable) is a necessary incentive. JFC
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:00:44
We're way passed the phase of depending on volunteers for development. It's not longer 1 cent for a bitcoin. It's more profitable to pay engineers at this point by the community.
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:10:16
The important part about the price is my net worth, and that's what I care about more than the price of any specific coin. So if each bitcoin I bought years ago can generate me $8K today, that's a new ATH in my book!
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:44:50
so how many.. 10? maybe 50? A company with $100B market cap would have over 10K engineers... and I'm sure that's not the amount working on LN or any other scalable solution
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:26:24
You just said it yourself, because of incentives.
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:24:38
I'm not a blockchain engineer. But I'd be willing to chip in for their salary. And I'm sure other big bitcoin investors would do the same.
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:58:31
Bitcoin is exactly like a company in the sense that it's trying to be as valuable as possible. And of course you can hire engineers to work on an open source project... look at Red Hat for example
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:47:47
Using BTC to buy stuff will actually increase the value of Bitcoin, because its usability is increasing. The whole reason the value is increasing is not because of the hodlers, but because of the people who actually need and use this kind of [awesome] money. See what happens in Zimbabwe, or Venezuela, or Japan.. some people actually want to USE bitcoins, not just hodl.
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:55:44
I said "in the sense that". Of course BTC is not a company. Learn your English.
@_date: 2017-11-18 07:47:24
You can tell her you have bitcoin but not tell her how much. It's not a matter of trust, but safety. If she (or anyone) knows how much you have, then it puts both of you in danger. It will creep up when making decisions, and before making any purchase. Just be honest with her about how she's not skilled with handling money, and it's for her own good that you not tell her how much, but simply that she gets to enjoy living with you, as being rich.
This assumes you do actually love each other.. But if she's just a brat that you married cause she's hot.. well then obviously you don't need to tell her anything, because you'll probably divorce her yourself after she loses her looks.
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:57:23
BTC is trying to be as valuable as possible, that's a fact. If it was worth 0 dollars, nobody would have bought in.
And you don't need one person in charge, just a team that develops and tests and integrates the BIPs, so we can get the new upgrades faster.
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:03:45
I'm pissed that he's the only one available to answer the question that was in that thread. There should be a huge team, with customer service and everything, because that's the only thing stopping bitcoin from going world wide.

Selling is the opposite of hodling, by definition
*okay buying is the opposite, but you get the point
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:21:46
use is more important than holding, here is the proof:
If you hold some shitcoin that nobody uses, and only you mine... it won't go up in price. The velocity of Bitcoin gives it its actual value. Holding the coin is great for saving, but it is not what's holding the price up. The Bitcoin algorithm already has a deflationary set of rules to avoid flooding the market with coins. In short, the use of the coin gives it its value and proves its effectiveness. Simply holding the coin is a strategy to get a better deal, not raise the value of it while its being transferred among those who actually use it.

How is this lock being down? Can I see an LN transaction in a blockchain explorer and see how it's different from a regular blockchain tx?
@_date: 2019-04-20 03:25:28
I trade a lot via Telegram and I simply verify everything, including the address, before sending. Other than that the buyer can go f himself. Also why I trade only inside the mall in a cafe, so it's all recorded in the security cameras.
@_date: 2019-04-29 01:17:25
In that case, LN is not truely secure, is it? Because according to what you're saying, its actual security comes from the blockchain to handle bad situations.
@_date: 2019-04-29 01:14:30
Not a good analogy, because Reddit can't work without the Internet, it depends on the Internet. The LN is a *separate* P2P network, that doesn't require the blockchain to communicate between its nodes.
@_date: 2019-01-29 22:59:53
I'm in the same boat, but I honestly realized that I don't need that amount of money any time soon... I just took out a very small amount so retire for about 2 years from working, so I can pay basic bills.. some of the money I used to travel abroad but realized I'm not into that lifestyle really.. And I'd rather hodl than paying taxes to these a-holes running the government, not to mention being targeted by the government once a huge amount of taxes is payed. I'd rather stay invisible and insignificant to them.
Ask yourself what you really want to get with money, otherwise no amount will make you happy. If you want to retire, you have enough to do that. Just cash it out on the streets and not via institutionalized trading platforms, so you won't get tagged for taxes.
I'm just using the cash I took out until bitcoin becomes fully used as a coin and there won't be any taxes on using it. If you think about your goals, and think about the downsides of taxes, then you might reach the same conclusion as I did. It's all about happiness and being fulfilled, and big money doesn't really get you either. mo money mo problems ;)
@_date: 2019-01-26 20:05:28
maybe not 100%, but it won't be anywhere near the massive army size attacks, only possible using governments. Bitcoin is the end of easy tax collection, which means the end of massive government corruption. That's why I'm staying in Bitcoin. Bitcoin is so much more than getting rich by early adopting it.
@_date: 2019-01-13 23:27:16
I think this should actually be implemented as a smart contract, so it won't charge any money until all the money was raised.
