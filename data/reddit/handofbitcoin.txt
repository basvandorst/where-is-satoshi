Gavin Andresen was out with FUD and fearmongering as soon as this rally started.

The catalyst for the $5000 bitcoin.

What I'm trying to bring up is how we have been completely overrun by negativity over the last 12 months.
@_date: 2016-06-07 11:42:45
Basically some of us were sitting on huge losses and to comfort us emotionally we resorted to comedy.

8 years in we come to the conclusion that gambling and cybercrime dwarf everything else in the crypto space.
What Jeff Garzik means is a venture that is crypto in and crypto out, meaning they use crypto as a unit of account(like all good money is).
What we have so far is people who just 'adopt' crypto with the promises of more fiat revenues in the future for doing so.
Your list is absolutely sad.

The company you keep says everything about you. Coinbase along with the dozen or so hardfork supporters are all becoming increasingly desperate to boost user count, they believe that problems with the protocol are the primary reason they are failing.
Coinbase has always lied. They lie about their importance in this ecosystem and have people believe that are some kind of industry leader, we are now finding out the exact opposite.

Pure means crypto in and crypto out.
From this we have cybercrime and gambling as the only pure crypto business's that exist. Why is it vehemently denied by people on here that bitcoin is kept alive by innovations such as ransom-ware? 
Do people on here really think that computer nerds buying $50 worth of satoshi dust are keeping order books liquid?

You've got some nerve coming back into this subreddit Gavin, after what you pulled with the blocksize fear mongering and claiming that Craig Wright was Satoshi. Shame on you

Pure means bitcoin in and bitcoin out and balances held in BITCOIN not US dollars. A business for example using 'BitPay' to get US dollars from bitcoin holders is not pure.

Gambling den operator, blockchain spammer, libertarian and general SCUMBAG finally admits to being wrong.

A classic case of the emperor having no clothes.
See you on the way out with your lies Armstrong.

Outside of gambling and 'exchanges' for early adopters to access large pools of fiat, there are no 'pure' crypto business's that are legitimate. Everytime this has been brought up by someone, vicious attacks would begin from bitcoin proponents. 
Early bitcoin adopters immediately invested into fiat exchanges followed by gambling operations.
A pure cryptocurrency business and the leading innovation that bitcoin has brought about:
Cryptolocker and ransomware.
The sheer revenue generated in pure crypto by ransom-ware surpasses every single 'legally incorporated bitcoin business'. 
Bitcoiners want to pretend all this 'innovation' around the edges is coming or has arrived to help poor people when in reality what we have seen is the exact opposite. Innovations that help a certain group of people increase their predatory behavior.

Ok shill.
Complaints about Coinbase have been gathering steam for the last 12 months.

How do you invest into bitcoin if buying bitcoin means someone sold it to me and no new value is created?

Rumours are they are going under.

People are not understanding just how small Coinbase is nor how high their monthly burnrate is.
Coinbase is in serious serious trouble, they are burning millions to keep the light on while average customer balance remains around $200.
Coinbase has always served what is referred to as the 'bitcoin poor'.
The cost of compliance and transfers is absolutely staggering and the user base is stagnating due to intrusive anti bitcoin KYC/AML.
Folks, remember. Mark Karpeles used KYC/AML as an excuse for years, other exchange operators have picked up on this tactic.
It seems all supporters of bitcoin hardforks are facing serious business issues, KNC miner being a recent example. If Coinbase is around 12months from now with the same people in charge it would be surprising.

Let's see the scum get my bitcoins.

Why would 10k be nothing to them if they don't generate a profit? Remember people thought Mt.Gox was generating millions in profits when it did not have a single month where they broke even.
Coinbase has massive compliance costs while serving a relatively poor userbase of people buying $100-200 here and there.
The losses at Coinbase are mounting and warning signs have been evident for quite some time now. Armstrong misled a certain group of people(namely this sad subreddit) into believing his firm is someone at the 'top' of crypto. They aren't.
@_date: 2016-06-09 18:11:16
The point is Coinbase is smaller than this subreddit made them out to be.
@_date: 2016-06-11 11:14:20
Bitcoin exists nowhere and everywhere simultaneously.
