I have done so, yes. Also have created private equity crypto trading firm for my friends, family, and clients who are unfamiliar with the whole process but want to make or break their investment.

"While that day may yet come, for now Mr. Dimon is falling back on his core criticism. He said on Fox that his opinion on bitcoin was always more about how governments would respond to it, specifically whether they would take steps to outlaw or discourage it if it became too big and threatened fiat currencies." -- Dow Jones
Lets fuck these bankers up their corrupt fiat assholes!!!!!

Please donate to RETT FOUNDATION.
I asked the manager of the foundation to submit an application for your fund. However, I am not 100% sure if she has not or yet... I have not heard back from her. 
* 
Rett Syndrome is a condition of the X chromosome where it is either damaged or mutated. This causes children who have it to have severe mental and physical disabilities and often kills infant boys as they only have one X chromosome to rely on. There are many meet ups and events that the foundation puts on to bring awareness and spread the message of Rett Syndrome and any amount of donation as little or big will definitely help with that goal. 
Of course this is a bit of a personal request as much as it is for the entire Rett community. One of my daughter's has Retts and she was progressing normally until about 18 months when she started to regress. She had the ability to play a little bit and sit up on her own with strength and then around 18 months she began to regress and was no longer able to talk or understand and loss the use of her hands. Never has been able to walk or crawl. We hand feed her meals every day which consist of blended chicken and veggies. Thankfully though, she is happy. She smiles constantly and is always content! She loves to watch Moana and Frozen and enjoys when we take her to go swing at the park. Thankfully she does have a sister who loves her very much and is a normal functioning child so it is nice to have that help both with love and help.

Bitcoin and Altcoins in general being an unregulated industry means that one is legally able to start a private firm for crypto trading without licensing.

I suppose we could use a third then because I do see where Gemini is founded by the Winklevoss's so I suppose they do have quite the liquidity.  I should check them out.....
Why do they deem you unworthy?

You won't believe these 25 phrases from a bitcoin speculator! Number 24 will have you on the edge of your chair!

Brand of the machine? I googled your phrase and came up with
    * Epilog
    * Orion
    * Z-Tech
    * Argus

Completely understandable. I went to go purchase some the other day when it was around $10,000 and they were not allowing any purchases....Not even for Litecoin or Ethereum.  Someone I was talking with the other day mentioned Gemini, and so I am going to do some research and see about opening an account with them. I do know that Gemini is owned by the Winklevoss twins and so it has a bit of mainstream vibe to the company as far as big names in tech go.

Thank you very much for doing your part as a business owner to spread the technology and availability of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange. If I had gold I'd send you one.

Hello, ! I have been an early adopter in bitcoin and would be happy to come in and help serve as one of your support liaisons if the company happens to be in need of one. I really have not had to work for a year or two now... with daytrading cryptocurrencies and forex, and it would be nice to get back in to a community work environment again. Take care!

It's really busting my balls...I was looking to buy some this morning after depositing some fiat at the bank. I hope they get this cleared up quickly or maybe they come back with segwit or something...
Maybe a 2nd good alternative to Coinbase that is US based is needed.

I currently am verified on GDAX. What should I do or read in order to learn how to use GDAX to limit the TX I pay in sending bitcoin/litecoin?

I know the buy/sell limits are at .01 but I think there is no transfer limit.

That's nice! We will be integrating our own API for this project. Thanks for the information, however.
