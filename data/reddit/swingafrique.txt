affordable for the general public? i'd say no. plans i have used in westafrica were frequently even more expensive than in (so called) developed countries. or they would be very restricted in terms of bandwith. for most average people internet cafes are a common way to get on the net. i hope this will change as technology spreads.

EBA is going to regulate bitcoin exchanges?
fully decentralized anonymous zero-knowledge-proof exchanges arise!

been traveling africa for a while, looking for places to settle, find friends and income. no success so far. so much hoping for cryptocoin infrastructure to spread to africa... endless opportunities...

i'm traveling westafrica since half a year and i'm very sceptical about your approach. donations create dependence, as does (so called) "development aid". many people here are very critical about this mentality and refuse to be in a begging position. 
the donation mentality is absurd as it is us western people who destroy the local economies of other regions by our unsustainable livestyle. it is our regimes exploiting the dependence established and maintained since early colonialism. you want to help poor people? well, join their fight against "our" regimes.
"our" bitcoins might not be that magical to people in poor regions as you think. there exist several kind of electronic cash systems. they are used and adopted much more widely than bitcoin in the US. even in the most remote places people will use mpesa or other services to transfer cash. of course these are not blockchain based and i really hope to see cryptocoin solutions in the future. not do donate my money to someone in need, but to enable people to help themselves and to disrupt the economic structures that still opress them. 
tl;dr: cryptocoins have to be spread to the whole world, but not as means to continue economic dependence but to empower people to help themselves.

are you targeting tourists too? you could do some advertising in thamel to get tech-savy tourists to use your exchange to get rupees (and remaining rupees back to btc when they leave). good luck!

only (or already) [one morrocan user]( on localbitcoins, without any transactions. 
travel from town to town, sell coins in the medina.

fast?! lol, since i opened it in another tab, letters in this textbox lag ~5 seconds behind me typing them. closed it and things are back to normal with my 4 tabs of bitcoinwisdom running smooth and usable.

i sell them. as i said, travel from town to town. publish dates and places in advance on the net. you think it might work? your point with emigrant kidds is quite interesting... 
so young people do use hawala to send money abroad? wouldn't hawala businesses be interested in bitcoin to transfer value?


i think they have no clue for now. also there is nothing to clamp down on. china is attempting to regulate exchanges, but not small scale person to person trading.

first time i hear smth positive about these people :-) congrats!

great, i firmly belive that this aplication of cryptos will be the first one reaching mass adoption. have you heard of the sms-wallet being developed for myriadcoin right now? i don't know about smartphone and internet coverage in philippines, but if older phones are still common, having the possibility to send coins via sms would make your service accessible to a broader audience.

hey, i was traveling westafrica last year and saw the potential for crypto currencies. amazing. when is your blog going online and where? is there a way to contribute to your cause? are you employed to do what you do or how will you cover travelcost? 
best of luck and may the roads be good!

Sometimes I wonder how much energy in total that has been wasted on pornhub worldwide?  Do you guys imagine it has caused a lot of co2  emissions?
