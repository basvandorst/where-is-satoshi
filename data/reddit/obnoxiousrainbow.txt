Or perhaps he just has valid criticisms of a protocol that is far from perfect.

I believe the more sound argument for inflation is that it incentives investment and entrepreneurial risk, leading to growth in an economy. Deflation, on the other hand, means that individuals have no reason to spend or invest more than they absolutely need to - contracting the economy (due increased saving which serves as a leakage to the economy).
To better explain it, Wikipedia has a good page on one of these effects (known as the paradox of thrift). Essentially it describes a situation where increased saving across an economy actually leads to a decrease in overall growth and, in turn, total savings.

Due to the inefficient nature of the blockchain system, bitcoin is stuck between a rock and a hard place. On one hand if the block size remains small, the amount of transactions per second will never be able to sustain the huge volumes at which gold is traded. On the other hand, if the block size is increased, say, a hundred fold - the blockchain's file size will spiral out of control (much faster than the increase in storage size of hardware).
Bitcoin will never be able to be traded like gold and thus it does not 'deserve to be priced like gold'. It is some orders of magnitude off.
