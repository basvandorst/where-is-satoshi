It's pretty scary to watch, people also seem to be oblivious to the fact they are completely out of their depth and are simply buying because it's on the news or Reddit and expect profit in a year (despite buying at $19k). Jeez. It's one thing if it's your own money, it's another to convince someone else to invest.
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:15:22
Believe you? I believe you sold at $7k and bought in again - I'm saying that is  really dumb. Those who bought in prior to 2017 aren't impressed with your shit, we just watch and laugh
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:22:26
Because you made your dad buy in at $19k, during a time when Bitcoin had a huge amount of media attention, the price then was clearly a little inflated and You joined the horde like everyone else, but worse than that you didn't even use your own money. If it is money you can afford to loose pay him now. I think it's pretty disgusting honestly. Why do you get to have his money interest free for a year? You scammed him dude well done.
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:09:30
Yeah that's pretty savage to get your dad to drop money at that level. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:28:13
Let her huh? Maybe "let her" make her own decisions, especially financial ones.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:31:53
You need to think a bit more about this. But I'll put it simply. It is a good thing if it can be used as a currency, for many reasons and that should be obvious
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:02:35
Not to mention you sold at $7900 a couple of months ago then bought back in at $17k - just flush the money it's quicker
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:16:01
What? If there is noone to buy your coin because they are all hording coins how do you expect to make any money? It is only worth something if someone is willing to buy it for cash or exchange it for goods+services What do you think gives Bitcoin value?  
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:39:12
So in 5-10 years then? Unfortunately most of the people buying in in the last few months think long term is December 2018
@_date: 2018-09-12 04:23:02
Hardly. When the price goes down to the hundreds how are you going to pay you debts etc?
Bitcoin is a terrible investment
@_date: 2018-09-12 03:50:22
Probably not in our lifetime. Dream away though kid
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:16:11
I see you edited the part of this comment where you said you bought at $9k huh? I was going to tell you that you are full of shit because your post history exposes you, but I guess you figured that, otherwise you would be happy to lie to make out you are not a massive idiot.People like you like to lie to themselves about losses when they are gambling with this stuff. Yeah I looked through your post history, with BTC it's fun to see the post history of people selling and buying with no idea what the fuck you are doing. Hilarious.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:41:43
Oh my
@_date: 2018-09-12 05:46:24
No I actually agree with you, which is why there is no way Bitcoin will be what you think it is who knows what other technologies etc are going to come aling with something significantly better than what we have. Imagine what is possible when quantum computers come into full use.
You are the one going all in on a 10 year old technology. I'm not locked to a single belief like you clearly are since you cannot handle any criticism of your beloved Bitcoin..... Kid.
@_date: 2018-09-12 04:38:52
Absolute nonsense, a 7 month downward spiral convinces you of nothing?
Sub 1k in 2019 btw. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:46:08
What you don't trust the 18 year old financial genius? He understands Bitcoin apparently. But in all seriousness the amount of people who have bought I to Bitcoin because of the HODL meme is so fucking sad. They have no idea what the fuck they are doing but think they can comment saying people don't "understand" Bitcoin. Fuck me.
@_date: 2018-09-12 04:43:15
And btw worth $100k what in 2021?
NZD, pesos? The venuzuelan dollar? What if the USD is worth shit, how much gold will you be able to get? 
I thought you kids didn't care about fiat but it seems the only way you can actually turn your little tokens into something real
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:33:28
Why even get him to buy in if your plan now is to sell if it gets back to the point you bought it for? Are you completely oblivious? You might as well put the money into a term deposit and have a gaurunteed return, or anything else. My God you are stupid.
@_date: 2018-09-13 11:25:20
Why would it trend up and not down?
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:52:45
Sure you did man. I'm just having a laugh at you panic selling and buying like an absolute retard
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:30:24
Couldn't agree more. There are so many instant financial experts who think the smart decision is to just get on the bandwagon and they can't loose and will be rich in 6 months. Any amount of insight like you have pointed out would have led to a better outcome.
@_date: 2018-09-12 04:24:27
Oh you really think it will be worth $100k one day.
Oh dear, you are in for some pain
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:48:38
Haha. Seems one doth protest to much. Good luck dude.
But my point was you are an ass for mixing financial decisions with your relarionship, especially if you are buying in at $17k, you are in for some pain. Never said shit about your relationship, just the stupid financial decisions you are encouraging her to get involved in.
So if anyone is projecting it's you, I guess I hit a sore spot.
@_date: 2018-09-09 00:52:41
Or one
@_date: 2018-09-12 03:48:50
What if the price collapses.
@_date: 2018-09-12 05:50:57
I was just trolling tbh
@_date: 2018-05-27 19:33:05
More likely to see $4k in the next 3 months
@_date: 2018-05-27 19:30:09
Mate you make no sense at all. Typical Bitcoin fanboy
@_date: 2018-06-19 05:56:49
Whatever man. It's just an article. Why do people get so annoyed about this haha. I suppose a lot of people have lost a lot of money this year, but still, doesn't mean you just ignore any info you don't like
@_date: 2018-06-19 06:14:59
If you actually read it, there is very little opinion other than stating the reports findings.
Yeah no shit it's a clickbait headline it's the internet
@_date: 2018-06-19 06:05:16
Who cares. Any successful business, product etc will have articles both positive and negative, saying either you will make a shit ton of money, or you will lose it all.
Read it all and see what makes sense.
@_date: 2018-06-19 05:15:21
Haha of course!
@_date: 2018-06-19 05:11:57
Was just joking, fellow south islander here trying to wind you up ;)
@_date: 2018-06-19 06:30:15
Good talk. Lol
@_date: 2018-06-19 06:13:31
I mean it's saying that Bitcoin cannot process the same volume of transactions as visa/MasterCard because if electrical limitations. It's not just saying, yeah I don't think Bitcoin is popular.
Isn't it better to discuss this shot rather than dismiss it? This sub is brain dead
@_date: 2018-06-25 08:24:03
Are you talking about the drop in price or this meme?
@_date: 2018-06-19 06:10:07
No I mean who cares if it's not a positive Bitcoin story.
It wasn't an opinion peice by the way, it was summarising the BIS report. I would think it is worth knowing to at least see if you disagree
@_date: 2018-06-19 04:59:28
"You can expect the bitcoin faithful to dismiss the BIS report as the incumbent central banking establishment trying to bring down a challenge to its primacy.
It's true that the bank is part of that establishment. Often described as the central bank for central banks, the BIS acts as a counterparty and agent for central banks in their transactions.
But its duties also include policy analysis and research of interest to those member banks; producing an inaccurate or unfair analysis of a rival marketplace wouldn't be much of a service for those members."
@_date: 2018-06-19 06:05:44
Nobody needs to defend Bitcoin from critical analysis
@_date: 2018-06-19 06:17:28
For bitcoin to verify transactions on the scale of Visa or Mastercard systems today would require supercomputers and "communication volumes (that) could bring the internet to a halt."
@_date: 2018-06-19 05:52:20
I'm sure you read it haha. 
@_date: 2018-06-19 05:05:36
Do you live in invercargill or bluff. Either way I'm sorry.
@_date: 2018-06-19 05:51:38
The article doesn't say Bitcoin is dead necessarily
@_date: 2018-06-19 05:54:02
Ok...but the article doesn't say Bitcoin is dead. Read more than the headline maybe?
@_date: 2018-06-19 05:17:49
What does any of that have to do with the article or report which are both fair and reasonable, even if you disagree. Maybe try and stop being such a fanboy
Idk wtf karma is
@_date: 2018-06-19 05:34:44
Next week it'll get there
@_date: 2018-06-19 06:08:51
It's not a journalist's view, it's talking about the BIS report
@_date: 2018-11-15 00:59:52
I had hodlers telling me that in January when I sold out. If they listened to me they wouldn't be over 50% down. This is an obvious and sustained loss of value over 11 months now. 
Any money to be made, has been already been made on Bitcoin, they people who are left holding the bag are the people who think because it took so many years to spike, they just have to wait and they will be rich. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 00:48:51
Holy fuck that is stupid
@_date: 2018-11-15 01:23:46
I HAVE....
@_date: 2018-11-15 01:16:54
Have you heard of these guys called Heavens Gate. They have some other long term ideas that would probably interest you.
@_date: 2018-02-05 10:19:06
You are right. Very rarely have we seen something lose 10s of billions of dollars in market cap. It is special
@_date: 2018-11-15 01:12:41
Impossible. All the crypto boom did was attract other coins. That showed the so called scarcity of Bitcoin is an illusion.
Any one of the coins out could become mainstream.
Maybe countries will create their own - why wouldn't they?
Or maybe something completely different comes along.
You are speculating on something after the horse has bolted. Literally throwing your money down a hole.
The last 11 months has been people selling out making money. I predicted sub $2k by year's end and I stand by that.
Oh and btw - what if Chinese Bitcoin miners (or some other group) own a huge proportion of Bitcoin - they would have the ability to manipulate the price - it's hardly decentralized then is it.
It's a free world, but you should really read about this wonderful thing called compound interest. If you have the discipline and extra $ to save, why not cash?
You kids I swear
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:42:43
Sell now. Every second you don't you lose more. I'm serious dude, this is going to go super low. It's going down because smart money is getting out with something.
@_date: 2018-02-05 10:11:27
Sure.... But still a retarded thing to say.
Whatever you think of Bitcoin there is no reason not to sell right now. Anyone who doesn't is losing money every second. 
Go back in the sandpit kid
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:30:58
Sure but Bitcoin is not a currency. And can you give me another example where something has lost over 50 billion in value, but people still want to invest calling it a dip? The true value if Bitcoin could be $1 for all anyone knows. The tech is amazing but when a new coin can pop up cheaper using the same tech why does anyone think there is an inherent value in BTC? 
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:30:35
Totally agree, just saying it's clear right now it's a steep drip to the bottom. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:19:06
You are such a dumbass haha
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:54:40
@_date: 2018-02-05 10:09:18
No. You are still to dumb to understand me. You should sell it all, dont look back.
You say. Nah wut bout futures me good b rich.
I said. Even if you believe that you should sell and rebuy in 48 hours.
Don't get me wrong, you should sell and never rebuy. But if I accept you as 100% correct you are still loosing money for no reason.
Fucking dipshit Jesus Christ haha.
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:36:00
Thank you dude! Everyone thinks BTC is unique except they are investing in hundreds of altcoins. It's ridiculous
 
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:41:02
I bought at $13k 2 or 3 weeks ago. Only $500 (at the time) but still, should have just flushed it
@_date: 2018-02-05 10:02:17
Dude Im well sold out of BTC. Who sits through Jan holding haha. Watching the fools watch their money drip away is my new jam because they think they are smart but are dumb as shit. Regardless. Every day I know you loose 10% + because you are ignorant. It's hilarious
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:21:09
Ok dude get rid of all your cash and go all in on Bitcoin.....oh wait you already did. Aaaaaahahahahahahahhahahaaha inhale hahahhahahahahaha cough
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:49:57
And those who have made a little bit are now cashing out hard.
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:43:35
Fuck the hodl memes. Time to bounce with what profit you have or cut your losses
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:10:26
Good example. BTC hardly compares though, investing low in a huge bank is hardly a risk.
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:17:50
Keep rushing round fanboying about an investment though - who is wasting their time again ..??
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:12:03
Fair, that is the right attitude!
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:55:21
What reasoning? I'm winding up Bitcoin fanboys. Retards like you.
@_date: 2018-02-05 10:05:37
In fact I was indicating it's just as retarded to invest in alts. But the existence of alts means Bitcoin is old and irrelevant
@_date: 2018-11-15 01:21:06
Wish in one hand and shit in the other and see which fills up first.
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:07:33
If you are calling it a dip and not a crash maybe reevaluate that decision.
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:34:17
How is it scarce when every mofo wanting to name a coin after their favourite movie can use the same (sometimes better) tech? The scarcity is a delusion. It's not digital gold.
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:36:42
Based on what assumptions....
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:00:29
I hope you love cardboard boxes too haha
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:20:03
Basic retard don't get economics. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:36:21
Couldn't summarise it better
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:56:11
I mean listen to you. "Blows past $20k" so deluded. No point reasoning with retards
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:10:21
Dude I'm not stupid to enough to have any money in this haha
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:59:37
Obviously crypto has a future but people are hanging on to BTC as they go down. But you are 100% agree with you
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:38:16
Care to explain why billions are invested in alt coins then?
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:13:03
And who were part of huge economic bail outs. But this demonstrates my point... There is no reason to be bullish on BTC now
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:10:56
During a huge economic downturn no less
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:30:47
Even if you are right. It's dropping 10% daily. You can "earn" money if you sell and buy 24 hours later and increase your position. That's why it makes no sense to not sell
@_date: 2018-02-05 10:20:04
Look you are brainwashed. Think for yourself, get of Reddit. And make responsible financial decisions. Although I'm sure you only invested what you are happy to lose haha
@_date: 2018-11-15 00:50:55
The technology can be replicated, copied and used by anyone, Bitcoin is not unique, Bitcoin is not worth 10% of what it is now.
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:37:21
You should have sold. If you haven't already. Tldr
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:27:36
Upvoted for being a good guy. Everyone needs to bail. I was saying this 48hours ago
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:39:09
That's what people think, that's why they are fooled into thinking BTC is special amongst 100s of others
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:09:31
!remind me 48 hours
Didn't even take 24 hours to dip 25%
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:54:42
No bad at all - tone was lost, I was genuinely curious of your opinion.
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:37:55
No...you sell and don't buy again.
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:10:24
Predicting the future is easy with overwhelming data. Whoever told you you can't predict the future is an idiot. We do it all the time if evidence supports it.
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:12:21
Hoping you forgot /s
@_date: 2018-02-05 10:56:27
Fuck off kid
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:05:37
$300 that's all I ever put in
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:57:00
I agree. But it's been going down for a month consistently. I submit I have more evidence than you. But hey I don't care, I sold early Jan. Keep hodling!
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:39:43
Should have sold at $17-20k
@_date: 2018-02-05 10:00:56
"probably more special" don't get too technical there haha
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:57:31
Strong ha ha are left holding the bag of shit haha
@_date: 2018-02-05 10:06:55
Let me guess.. you are ok coz you only invested what you are happy to lose. Bullcrap, the right attitude is to not want to lose a dollar. Fucking retards my god
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:08:35
Do you realise you are repeating every r/Bitcoin meme? Think for yourself, right or wrong who cares, but don't write a sentence full of other people's memes/groupthink to justify what you want to do. Think for yourself.
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:48:35
You are clearly intelligent.. BTC will drop another 15% tomorrow. Considering that why not AT LEAST sell out and buy in again in 24 hours. If you believe what you say and you intend to hold long term, this us a no brainier and you can increase your position.....
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:16:44
I'm just responding to comments here. Nice burn though, hurts so bad.  Not as bad as flushing your money into Bitcoin though. Happy to waste time but not $
