Thank you for your answer, and I am sorry to hear how serious the situation is there. 
I wonder if there is any way that a cryptocurrency could be designed so that it would be more helpful for a situation like the one in Venezuela - all the downsides you point out are very legitimate. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 19:16:32
I'm really sorry to hear this happened to you, and I wish you all the best.
This is a perfect reason why I am always warning people about using stop-losses. They just force you to automatically be the worst possible trader and sell low.

Are you talking about the Friedman LLP thing from 2017? The one where [their own website says it wasn't an audit?](
From their site: "These consulting services do not constitute an audit or attestation engagement, which would include a significantly expanded scope of procedures and take substantially more time to complete."
For the record, I'd like nothing more than for them to turn out to be solvent. I love the idea of Tether, and their business model of earning $ on the interest of the deposits while providing a useful tool seems like a real win-win. The only problem is their continual unprofessional behavior and total failure to produce an actual audit. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:15:49
Do you think cryptocurrencies can help you, or the people of Venezuela, to get through these times?
@_date: 2018-01-15 15:22:51
Diversification, my dude.
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:31:47
The promise to conduct regular audits and then not do so, and I'll tack on the disclaimer they post that indicates they have absolutely no legal obligation to accept USDT back and that holders of USDT have no claim whatsoever with them.
Their business model shouldn't necessitate either of those things, and yet there they are... it's a shame really.
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:24:37
Because they said they would as part of their business model?
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:41:00
Your assumption here is that people only get fooled by lies and deception because they are making bad choices?
Asking "Why be a bad judge of character?" is a bit like asking "Why not have 20/20 vision?"

It doesn't improve returns on average, it's true, but it does an excellent job of minimizing regret and behavioural errors, which is a big deal for retail investing.

u/klethera just did you a huge favor - that advice about putting your money into a three-fund portfolio is the best investing strategy to start when young and maintain your whole life. Bitcoin is awesome too, but if you want something that doesn't carry massive risk and you can rely on for the next 30-40-50 years, that advice is the way.
It's awesome that you are interested in pursuing it and seem to be open to learning about this so young - keep that up and you'll succeed for sure!

If everyone theoretically used bitcoin, inflation would likely be very different and greatly reduced. Because bitcoin has a "hard" maximum limit and fixed rate of new issuance, the market can be confident that the money supply will only increase by a certain amount (and then after that, not at all). 
That's very different from essentially every existing state-issued currency, where the protection against the government deciding to simply print more is "Well, they probably won't!"
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:04:39
The coins being lost, at some point, will be a small enough influence that they will just be a rounding error on the normal deflationary price change that is expected. I think it will ultimately be a pretty small/gradual change unless we see a large number of ultra-bitcoin-rich dying without any provision.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:40:44
Just put the money you'd have used for the gold into some index funds instead : )
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:18:04
Fair enough, but saying that bitcoin is worth "more than gold" is definitely pretty confusing if you aren't talking about total market cap vs. market cap : )
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:56:00


Seems strange to decide to randomly pick two totally unrelated units of measurement to compare - if we need to determine if a bitcoin is cheap or expensive compared to an ounce of gold, we definitely need to know how many bitcoins there are in total and how many ounces of gold in total, no?
Would you say that Bitcoin should climb higher because a bitcoin costs a lot less than a share of A-class Berkshire Hathaway, or drop lower because it's way more expensive to buy 1 bitcoin than a B-class share of Berkshire Hathaway? You see the problem, right? The price of an individual share (or bitcoin, or ounce of gold) isn't the important part, it's how much it costs to own X% of the entire supply.
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:30:08
It basically means to buy a fixed dollar amount on a regular basis rather than buying in with one big lump sum and then stopping forever (or trying to "time" highs and lows by buying and selling emotionally).
Dollar-cost-averaging helps mitigate the psychological feeling of regret because if you put in $100 on the first of the month every month no matter what, then when the price-per-coin is high you will naturally be buying fewer coins than when it is low. Dollar cost averaging makes you automatically buy "less" when it's up and "more" when it's down, so that over a long period of sideways volatility you will generally see a profit.

This is funny because I think for the vast majority of investors it would be the exact opposite: they understand the principles of the stock market and stock valuation, but know nothing about cryptocurrencies.

$1.7M it totally enough to retire on. 
Using a 3.5% annual safe withdrawal rate, that's a $60k annual salary for eternity. If you can't retire on 60k a year you spend too much bruh.

I think you mean the opposite of "jury is out" actually, unless I'm misunderstanding you.
@_date: 2017-08-11 13:49:06
Yeah that is WAY more elegant, lol. Let's go with that.
@_date: 2017-08-09 20:27:09
If people were certain the price would be way up in the near future, it would already be way up. At any given price, you have to accept that no one knows for sure, and it's basically impossible that anyone ever will. 
This is the same with the stock market and most other investments: the current price reflects everyone's beliefs about where it will go in the future in an efficient and open market, so you can never rely on advice about where it will go short-term.
If you want to invest, try to determine what you think the potential is long-term, and act on that. That's my advice.
@_date: 2017-08-10 18:04:53
Yeah, the correct analogy for a bitcoin in terms of currency is more like 1 bitcoin = a briefcase full of bills. You can just buy the individual bills instead of a whole briefcase at a time.

I'm far from wealthy myself, but please believe that there are many, many people whose relationships with friends and family have suffered from disclosing their net worth. You see it constantly in the personal finance subreddits. 
Money brings out strange emotions in people. Look up how many lottery winners ended up kidnapped or murdered by people close to them, and you'll start to see the wisdom in playing your cards close to your chest.

I'm surprised you see main reserve currency ahead of daily use by normal people. I'd expect it more in the reverse order.

I assume once you hit the retirement number, you move to a stock/bond portfolio for retirement. And $45k US post tax may be tight if you have a lot of kids, but is totally enough to retire on.

It's a typo, they meant "hold on to your assess", which is short of "assessment", meaning our assessment of the value of our investments. It's a common expression, I'm sure you'll see it a lot.

There's no rational basis for preferring higher profit to not killing people. Both of those things are valuable only insofar as an individual has an emotional interest in them.
Therefore you can't simply declare that people assigning some value to human life or the environment is sub-optimal just because you personally don't assign any value to those things. The decision of where to assign value is subjective.
Some people assign value only to dollar returns and place no negative cost on environmental destruction, murder, etc. while others may assign blended values between those factors, and neither is objectively more correct. It's not necessarily inefficient for someone to prefer to reduce the amount of pollution/murder/slavery in their portfolio.

This comment needs to be higher up - invest a portion of your income every month regardless of current price, try not to check the price, and wait ~10 years. Congratulations, you are probably rich.

I know everyone likes to make fun of technical analysis, but your tongue-in-cheek comment is completely overlooking that the chicken entrails I scattered all over my counter top during this morning's NYSE opening bell show a triple retracement event coming for Bitcoin, provided of course the liquidity levels remain constant. You can't argue that that forecast is a strong signal that it will go way up (unless the other conditions are met in which case, way down).
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:46:42
Of course, we have to acknowledge that technical analysis is only 99% perfect and there are occasional surprises (learning opportunities!).
That's why it's good to perform multiple independent analyses for a given situation in order to provide further confirmation before making a trade decision. Therefore, in order to be rigorous, I dropped a large dose of LSD and examined the future of bitcoin from the astral plane, where I observed several red candlestick patterns signalling a fibonnacci cascade into a head-and-shoulders pattern. This is clearly a bearish indicator (except that during my time in the astral plane I stepped on my cat, which means it could be a bull indicator if we manage to bargain successfully with Dormamu)

If you were going to spend $100 on amazon either way, then it doesn't make any difference whether you spend $100 USD or $100 worth of bitcoin, then use the $100 USD to buy more bitcoin. It doesn't matter what happens to the value.
@_date: 2017-10-18 17:00:20
I agree, and I assume your larger point is that if bitcoin was the norm rather than credit cards, the price of everything would go down by a few % due to the absence of the need to tack on CC fees. 
However, the point being discussed was how it matters to a normal person in the short term. You have a tragedy of the commons where although it would be better if everyone used bitcoin, for each individual it is preferable to use a rewards credit card. That point stands even taking into account what you said above.
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:38:18
I don't know what anyone said in this chain to make you think we're calling it a bubble.  Personally I am pro-bitcoin, for what it's worth. Buffet's point is that Bitcoin can't be valued in the same way that a stock can, which I would think is a pretty uncontroversial position.
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:09:08
If it were possible to know in advance the "lowest" then it would indeed be dumb. I don't think it's possible.
Your statement sounds similar to "Not putting a big bet right before you get dealt a blackjack is objectively dumb" - you can't know in advance when that will happen.
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:22:19
"Production" here refers in part to the idea that the company will capture additional resources as a consequence of its operations rather than a sort of "what is the product being sold" kind of definition.
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:50:28
What would be the alternative? By definition a dip ends when it turns to an increase, and a maximum ends when it's followed by a dip.
That's like saying the peak of a mountain is followed by a downslope - true by definition, but pretty useless.
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:03:46
This was addressed by saying that unless there is a lower price for bitcoin than for credit card, that is not relevant to the consumer.
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:41:47
You are surely correct, but here we want tools for the individualist capitalist to assess the return of an investment, so that is the context being used.

If you don't care then don't open by asking people to keep the discourse civil.

Amen. Buying a bunch of cheap crap just because you're losing purchasing power is not only killing the planet, it also just means everyone ends up with a house full of junk they bought a few years ago and don't end up using.
One way or another we're going to have to stop buying so much cheap plastic bullshit, so you may as well get rich in the process.
@_date: 2017-10-30 15:59:17
This is exactly why the discourse isn't civil. Both sides say what you're saying now, and point to some past offence as their justification.

I can only admire your candor and "bravery", but you may want to read up on diversification.
Even if you have a high risk tolerance (which obviously is the case) you can get better expected return without additional risk by diversifying properly. Perhaps a nice low-fee stock index?
@_date: 2017-07-18 18:40:23
It would be shockingly unlikely if no one made money timing the market - people who say "Only fools time the market" are well aware that there are many, many people who have made money "timing the market", in the same way that there are many people who have made money playing the lottery or roulette or baccarat. The fact that it's sometimes profitable doesn't make it a good idea for the average person or a good investing strategy.
The average expected value of trying to time the market, for all players, is negative (fees). Giving it as advice to others is silly at best and malicious at worst.
If you start with 10,000 people trying to time the market, even if each year 75% of them lose money, you'd still have 9 people after 5 years who always made money and left posts like "been making good money timing the market ; )" even though trying to time the market is objectively terrible advice to give an average person.
I believe you made money and I wish you well, but please realize that your own success playing market movements does not make it good advice for others to follow.
@_date: 2017-07-24 14:09:51
Surely you mean "is only a very minor factor" ?
@_date: 2017-07-12 15:10:19
If you don't already have other investments and if you panic sold last time, I don't think it's a good idea to put it all in Bitcoin. Bitcoin could have a huge upside or a very severe downside, and if past price movements were enough to make you emotional, you don't want to fall for the same thing twice.
I'd suggest doing the following:
1. Set aside any money you'll need in the short term (next ~5 years or so) to cover any planned expenses, plus an emergency fund in case of sudden unexpected costs. Doing this first means you can afford to let your investments ride out highs and lows without feeling pressured to sell, which is crucial.
2. Take at least half of what's left and put it into a stock index fund with Vanguard. This is a very safe/diversified/boring investment that will act as a backbone for long-term investing. You need to essentially forget that you own this for ~10-20 years. You'll thank yourself later. Try to do this in a tax-advantaged account if there is one available to you (Roth IRA, TFSA,  etc.)
3. Take the remainder and put it into Bitcoin gradually, say 20% every month. This is called dollar-cost averaging. It won't help you make more money, but it will help you avoid feeling too much regret if the price shoots up or down right after you start putting your money in, because you'll spread the pain.
If you follow these three steps, you'll have a good chunk of your portfolio in Bitcoin like you wanted, but you also have a solid backup (the stocks) in case Bitcoin doesn't pan out, and your emergency fund will let you ignore highs and lows without needing to sell.
Then you don't sell for at least 5 years and just hodl and try to forget you even own these investments (but don't forget your private keys : )

There is some sort of bug with the human mind that makes us assign acronyms to everything. Constantly. The term for the phenomenon is "backronym", where people hear a word they don't immediately know the origin of, but know the meaning, and just make up an acronym and repeat it with confidence.
Basically almost any time you hear someone tell you a slang term is an acronym, assume they're full of shit. You'll be right a lot more often than you're wrong.
@_date: 2017-07-06 15:35:11
I hate to be that guy, but this is actually a flaw in human thinking called "mental accounting". You don't lose more future gains by paying for something with bitcoin than if you use cash, even if bitcoin shoots way up, because any unspent cash can be turned into bitcoin.
We like to laugh at the pizza guy, but if you bought a pizza on that same day, guess what: you lost exactly as much as that guy did, because those dollars could have bought bitcoin on that day at the rate he used to buy the pizza. We all lost just as much as pizza guy did: he just took one extra step first, which was to turn those dollars into bitcoin.
Whether you buy that $1 soda with a dollar bill or with bitcoin, if the value of bitcoin goes up 100 times you "lost" $99 for that soda (because the dollar bill could have bought bitcoin at that day's prices). 
So you see, if you're worried about spending bitcoin because you think they will go up, you need to be just as worried about spending dollars (or anything else that could be turned into bitcoins).
There are a lot of good reasons not to spend bitcoin (taxes, lack of acceptance, all those other points are totally legit) but increasing value is not one of them. It's a logic trap.
@_date: 2017-07-19 00:43:32
Yes, good point. If we assume that at any given moment, bitcoin is +EV, any "sell" is negative expected value for the future. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 13:49:28
Traders on average are "right" a bit less than 50% since they will incur a lot more fees/spreads.
@_date: 2017-07-24 14:47:25
Agree 100%. The amount of hoops one needs to jump through to "safely" buy and use it right now is completely absurd. 
The hardcore tech people don't seem to grasp how massive the current barrier to entry is, or care, but this is far and away the  obstacle to success in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-07-19 00:06:48
How do you figure? Seems like short-term trades like market timing would be zero sum, other than fees.
