Did you pay for CC fees, or is that just the fees they charge? If it's just their monetization model, that has nothing to do with bitcoin. You're paying for them to run the website and the service, connect you to thousands of professionals, and arbitrate any disputes. Those costs don't magically disappear with bitcoin. You could choose to contact the person out of the website and pay by check. But you would lose the service that freelancer provides.

I've had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Cargill, and he's an awesome guy. I took a firearms safety course at Central Texas Gun Works, and before the class started, he shared a news video that had just broken that day - with him at his shop promoting Bitcoin. He is very supportive of the Bitcoin community. In fact, while we were in the class, they were doing filming out in the hall for more news stories.
I'm disappointed in BitPay for cutting him off. He seems like a real stand-up guy.

You can keep bitcoins in a few places, all of which are wallets:
* Online wallets (like blockchain.info)
* Local Wallets (Like bitcoin-qt)
* Offline Wallets (Armory is capable of doing this - offline not attached to the internet, I believe blockchain.info can as well) 
* Paper Wallets (write down public &amp; private key, or print out qr codes that include them.)

Yeah, I don't think there are any needs for banks to keep funds safe, which is one of the main reasons people use banks with fiat. One could make their bitcoins completely safe with cold storage. The only advantage of depositing in a bitcoin bank would be negligible interest rates because they're turning around and loading your bitcoins out, but that's why lots of places are in a money crisis to begin with.
We don't need banks to process transactions either. That's what the miners are doing.
I don't think there is any market for a bitcoin bank, because bitcoin doesn't need them to thrive. Fiat does.

Without making 2-factor auth mandatory, I don't know how they would achieve this.
There's no details on how the guy's account got hacked. They could have used a trojan, keylogger, man in the middle, or phishing attack and easily gotten his password. 2 factor auth could have helped to prevent his account from being emptied.
Or what he could have done is kept the coins in his wallet and transferred only enough to cash out $1k each day. Or set up with multiple exchanges and done that to speed the process up.
However, I agree that Gox can do more to educate their users on the security of their accounts, and provide an easy guide on how to properly secure it.

@_date: 2013-05-22 14:38:42
The same way it works with cash money.
Say I deposit 10 BTC in BitBank. The bank could lend out 2 BTC each to 6 people, for a total of 12 BTC lent out. As long as the borrowers don't withdraw their BTC at the same time, the bank is in the clear.
In this case, you're not actually borrowing raw bitcoins. You're borrowing bitcoin notes. A promise that if you want to withdraw a bitcoin, it's there for you to withdraw, otherwise, it goes to work for the bank by you paying back more than you borrowed (which the bank didn't have 100% of anyways.)

Exchanges holding your BTC is the equivalent of an online wallet. If your password is compromised, they can empty your account, because the website holds your private key.
With paper wallets, you generate your own public &amp; private key. Send your bitcoins to your public key, and then your paper wallet is loaded.
At this point, no one can touch your bitcoins, because only YOU have your private key.
To spend BTC from your paper wallet, load the private key to a local wallet

While I understand your reasoning, there just isn't enough of a competitive market yet, which ASICminer is capitalizing on. It's not ASICminer's fault. They're in business to make money. People are willing to spend X amount of BTC for their product - which has sold out, so the demand is definitely there. Even with a lower price point, the demand would be the same or greater, and ASICminer would clearly be at the wrong price point for their maximum profit - running out of stock much more quickly.
Once more ASIC manufacturers ramp up production and start shipping consistently, you will see a much more fair market from everyone, because customers will have a real choice. Currently, customers don't have very many choices, which results in very high prices because demand is high and supply is low.

If you're in the US, you can go to the bank that issued the check and get it in cash immediately.
Then, use the cash for BitFloor's Bank of America deposit (using LocalTill) or MtGox's BitInstant deposit (using MoneyGram). I think BitInstant's limit is $500 per transaction - but if you do multiple transactions of exactly $500, MoneyGram will flag the others as a "Possible Duplicate" transaction and won't let it go through.
There is currently no way to cash a check for bitcoins, and even if you could, the check would take a couple days to clear. (Which is why you want to go to the issuing bank and get cash to take to do a deposit elsewhere.)
