Well I'm a communist like and I honestly don't give a shit about your $500. We don't care about the savings of randomers we care more about large fixed capital.

When the alternative is starvation for you or your family it isn't truly voluntary.
With regard to the anarchist view of hierarchy though this quote from Bakunin is quite clear:


By this the boss falls under the kind of authority that Bakunin does reject. If your boss was just another individual that you were helping out because you wanted to then fair enough but as soon as you don't want to you have no obligations and he cannot use coercion to make you do what he wants. Enterprise would be more like co-operative enterprise of freely associated human beings.
Whether you agree with what I've said or not it is apparent that you have had little exposure to anarchism in the first place. If you want to understand it a bit more my suggestion would be this short enough piece, [Anarchism and Anarcho-Syndicalism, by Rudolf Rocker.]( Definitely one of the most clear and concise classic overviews out there.

Anti-capital*ist* not anti-capital. Their problem with capital is that it is under the control of a small and unaccountable group of people. Not that it exists. It's quite a common misunderstanding.

I know there's separate crowd funding going on to raise money for one of the international brigades to get better medical supplies.
