Little bit of trivia, it was Rainn who got Mona foundation to apply for the Pineapple fund back in 2017. He knows his crypto!

I refuse to believe that there are taxi drivers in Thailand who are sick of corruption. In the two years I lived there, every, single one tried to inflate the fares.

Having personally spoken to about 30 or so of the 55 recipients during my research into the Pineapple Fund, there is nothing to suggest whether Pine was Male, Female or otherwise.  Just that they were a truly awesome individual (or possibly group of people) doing great things with crypto.   
I hope that others follow suit, and donate whether large scale, or small - as I think donating cryptocurrency to nonprofits is one way to increase the mainstream adoption of crypto beyond early adopters.

Hi,  I've been speaking to a bunch of nonprofits lately (including a lot of pineapple fund recipients - all of which accepted large anonymous donations of between $50,000 and $5,000,000 USD equivalent of bitcoin), and while there are many who will not allow anonymous donations, there are also many whose giving policies are currently in progress to allow this. 
For anyone who is interested, here is some info on taxes and donations (if you are USA based): [
And here's a listing of nonprofits currently added to the aggregator who accept crypto, shortly this will have added functionality that will allow search by category, cryptos accepted, location, charitable status etc: [

Side note - there's a fake Pineapple Fund account on twitter spamming nonprofits.  Most likely a phishing scheme, it would be great if folks could report it to twitter: [

Not sure what they thing a ledger does, but the myth about not being traceable should have ended years ago ...
