I work as a cashier at a large store and just for the fun of it I'll ask my customer "have you heard of Bitocin?"  I have NEVER had a "Yes" to that question! So obviously we need as much Bitcoin chatter as we can get. Hmmmm? If it's true that GoPro has never had to advertise? Couldn't the same work for Bitcoin... only instead through word of mouth and commenting on articles such as this one rather than GoPro's youtube videos. Still I think it's great when someone goes out of their way to promote bitcoin as bitbell did with the sharing of this newspaper article.

Sure glad I didn't paint you all with same brush... cause if I had only read what that "witcoin" lady was babbling on about; I may have assumed all Bitcoinists were "ugly" on the inside like her.  I'm so glad there are so many of you, who form such a wonderful group and who have such wonderful wit. Matched by your gifted intelligence!  Thanks for out-numbering the "witcoin" lady!  Rock on Bitcoin!  :)

Do the more people that hit the up arrow, which is the upvotes, let reddit then determine if you get more time on the site, so more people can read your post and comment on it?

P.S.  what the heck does "karma whoring" mean?

No, I said I'm new to reddit. And hope I don't get too much flack for making mistakes on the site. Like posting to the wrong spot or whatever.  Jeez, there's a lot of angry people on here.  I can't figure out if what "nobodybeleivesyou" said is an insult or just a warning for me or something.  Now I'm wondering if you select few on here, want to keep the Bitcoin movement to yourselves. Perhaps I've misjudged the whole works of you.  Sad really.

Yep! I'm one of the people on here that is an absolute newbie. I'm trying to learn about the reddit site and how to use it.
Thanks for your patience gang!
