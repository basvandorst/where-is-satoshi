My friend and I were verified. Had our accounts locked at separate times. They were eventually unlocked, but we felt it was unacceptable that we can just be locked out reacting to such a volatile market.

Yeah, this submission is spreading FUD too.


It's a zero-sum game for everything tradeable. People are making money off of other people. Value isn't coming from thin air.

That's me in a nutshell. I've literally been trying to buy 0.02 BTC for the last 5 hours, and I've looked through about 30 different exchanges, and I've even looked through the numerous e-payment systems that those exchanges would only accept.
I want to make a quick payment. Circle is a mobile-only app that requires an OS version that my hardware doesn't support. Everybody else requires verification systems that ruins the point of an instant transaction. I understand that chargebacks are extremely easy with credit cards and Paypal, but paying $15 to $40 in wire fees for not even $5 worth of BTC is stupid.
Plus, it's the weekend. I have to wait 3 to 6 days for a wire transfer to go through, wait a week for the payment to be processed to receive my BTC, then actually use my BTC and wait for them to take a week processing my payment. It's absolutely ludicrous, and despite how much I hate Paypal, I can literally make a new account and start using it in minutes.

Which leads into what Seccour said, people leaving the platform, as evidenced by the other posts here.

They can, but people aren't going to take one look past Coinbase. The fact that this thread exists already proves that. There are so many other options that I can't even count them all off of the top of my head.
If Target can't handle business, like in Canada a few years ago, then just go to WalMart, but people will always make excuses for not shopping somewhere that might be unfamiliar to them.
