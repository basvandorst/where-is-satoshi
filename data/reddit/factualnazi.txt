I hope you're being sarcastic. His comment actually displays some knowledge about Chinese domestic economic policy -- which is usually non-existent in this subreddit. 
China has incredibly strict fiscal regulations on its citizens. It doesn't let them send money out of the country (without govt approval, which they never give) or invest in foreign businesses. That much is fact. Cryptocurrencies allowed your average Zhang to do just that; bypass all of China's laws, rules &amp; regulations. That much is also fact. So why *wouldn't* China ban cryptocurrencies? You think they'd just allow 50 years of central planning go down the drain? That's stupid and naive. 
Anyone who's even mildly familiar with Chinese domestic economic policy knew this was coming, it was inevitable. China is a very strict country when it comes to fiscal freedom - their citizens essentially don't have any.

That's like a company experiencing a hostile takeover, and telling the previous board members/investors, "Hey don't get mad, that's childish". 
Except it's not childish to not want to work for a project that is now significantly different from what you signed up for. Having your work co-opted isn't something to be happy about.

Look at who was promoting it, and look at the timing of when development died. Since China announced their crypto regulations/ban, development has ground to a halt. 2x was a China led initiative and attempted take-over.

Normally this is the case, but China is a special exception. If China *truly* wants to crackdown on something, it does so very effectively. It does this because it doesn't have the same checks and balances that other governments have which may handicap their law enforcement. They don't have to worry about being too rough with suspects, using excessive force, don't have to wait for warrants or 12 layers of bureaucracy to get something done. 
That kind of effectiveness is a double-edged sword. On one hand, they're extremely effective at achieving their goals or plans. On the other, they're one of the most corrupt countries on the planet, according to transparency international's [corruption index]( 
The reason why localbitcoins is popular there right now, is because the ban/regulations don't go into effect until the end of the month. There's still 5-6 days left.

That's something that's been bothering me over the last few years. ASIC chips aren't bleeding edge octa-core intel chips. They're relatively mundane, with the focus more on energy consumption/efficiency than a need for raw power. So why hasn't a competitor to Bitmain popped up in China, the knock-off capital of the world? If a factory is producing some widget even mildly profitable, the factory across the street with start producing that widget too. This goes for anything; from tablets with Chinese SoC processors to shoelaces. So why hasn't a competitor created their own ASIC chips? Given their non-existent IP laws, it's unbelievable that after all this time, Bitmain is still the sole producer. 
It leads me to believe it's a government imposed monopoly. The government wants to control mining in China (and by extension, *all mining* since 80% of mining takes place in the country) and does this by just having a single manufacturer that they can control or direct/oversee. 
unfortunately for China, if this is the case, it's going to be short-lived. Plenty of companies are ready to release their own mining chips. One company in Japan [is nearly there]( - they're going to be releasing 12nm chips with 7nm coming soon after. Bye bye bitmain, it was nice knowing you.

More than 80% of the hashrate [is in China]( (82.4 to be exact). That leaves 17.6% for the entire rest of the world. Russia's mining venture can't be that big - the numbers just don't add up.

It's just a matter of time. I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if they're already working on some killer technology for mining as we speak. The market is there and I can't see both AMD and Nvidia completely ignoring it. Bitmain's time is limited because there's no way they can compete with AMD and NVidia. Those are worldclass companies with a global reach.

At this point, I'm less concerned about my ideology and more concerned with the shadow centralization that has taken place. How much of Bitcoin's hashrate rests within China? Answer:
Why does one country have more than 60% of the hashrate? And not just any country, but one of the [most corrupt]( in the world? One of the least free? If I was a betting man, and bitcoin was to fail or fold, I would put all my money on China being the reason behind it. China only cares about China, they don't care about Bitcoin, its technology (unless they can exploit it, or make money off it) or anyone's principles.

I don't mean to sound rude, but isn't it obvious? The longer the status quo remains, the more power Bitmain acquires. Doing nothing is exactly what Bitmain wants. Bitmain and Jihan becomes an even larger, more powerful cabal. At that point, it may be too late to go a different direction with bitcoin, it would then become ChinaCoin (property of the PRC).

It's funny how all the "messengers" that typically side with the miners and/or Bitmain are all new accounts with virtually zero history. I can't wait to go re-check them all after this is over with, see how many were real and how many were the sock-puppets I suspect them to be.

The miners are supposed to be in it for the long-term profits &amp; revenue. Going after short term high fees and causing bitcoin a huge hassle by dragging ass on it out of selfishness will only hurt them, and bitcoin as a whole. 
And it's not "miners", it's bitmain and China more specifically.

Everyone is seeing this as Jihan's words, but I'm almost certain Jihan is just the PRC's mouthpiece. You can't run a business in China without their explicit approval, and something requiring approval of all that subsidized free electricity means they have their fingers deep. Jihan is just the front man so we're thinking he's the bad guy so the people's republic of China don't catch any flack -- for them, it's all about "face" or how they appear to the public. You don't need a tinfoil hat to believe China has their claws deep in Bitmain
And why wouldn't they? China restricts and controls how their citizens spend or invest their money; Their restrictions on capital flow &amp; investments make the U.S look like a libertarian paradise by comparison. I mean, they have a great firewall and restrict what people can view on their computer, and god help you if you're a foreigner looking to open or run a buisiness in China -- unless you're a multibillion dollar international powerhouse, you won't even get your foot in the door (and if you do, you might be shown the exit if they don't like what you're doing, that's if they don't just outright steal your IP like they did with google, who abruptly came back home). 
You think they're going to allow bitcoin to flourish in their country? That's naive. It's also naive to assume China would be open and honest with their dislike of the idea -- they can't completely destroy bitcoin, so they're going to do what they excel at: pretend to tolerate it while they covertly damage bitcoin, weaken consumer confidence in bitcoin (and by extension, cryptocurrency as a whole), subvert bitcoin and most of all, cause confusion and chaos. All of those facets Bitmain has hit and hit hard.
