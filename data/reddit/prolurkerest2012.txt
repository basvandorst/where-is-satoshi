Pretty much all of them have decoupled with a 15% plus spread from BTC!

I haven’t looked into BCHs encryption level, but here’s a good approximation of the difficulty.  
It’s basically impossible.

I got some at the fork, didn’t really care about it until I saw the scam that is was and sold on the next peak.  Not going to give you trading advice on Reddit, but I would personally determine an exit point because it will most likely go down in history as just another failed fork.

Bitmain won’t get to 100%.  There is too much BTC that was, and still in, cold storage ever since the fork.

I don’t think you are understanding my point.  Porsche and Honda had to approve that video.  I could come up with a million analogies and it appears you are going to find a some minor difference in all of them and argue it’s not the same.  Yet, it all goes back to my original post, the simple man isn’t going to care about your microscopic difference argument.  They are going to see a red and a green apple.  All I’m asking is that /bitcoin alters the narrative on the topic to be positive BTC and basically ignore BCH.  The world will know which one is superior.  It only looks bad on BTCs part when BTC goes on the defense against a fraud.

Obvious differences between the lawnmower and the Porsche will sway me to buy the Porsche. This again, is my point.

That’s exactly what I was thinking at first.  Yet, to me, Ver and gang got absurd with it so I sold and moved to other opportunities as a symbolic gesture.  Unfortunately, I think they may a good run in the coming years due to their blatant deceit of the public.  Just can’t wait till they get lazy, slip up, and get put where they won’t have access to the internet.

They both have four wheels and a motor.  
BCH thrives on people who are willing to bite on defending BTC.  Just sayin

Umm... then what is this:
@_date: 2018-05-05 14:43:41
I gotcha and agree. What I’m inferring is that:
1) the non-technical masses are going to see the two protocols as red versus green apples.  We know it’s owned by no one, but at the end of the day, joe blow isn’t going to understand this and is only going to see two sides arguing which one is “real”.
2) r/bitcoin is being flooded more and more every day with this topic.  My point is, BTC is the superior product, so just let the inferior BCH and their wicked overlord say what they want.  Novices will see the writing on the wall over time.  Instead of going down to their level and going on defense (posting in r/bitcoin about how BCH and Ver are fakes is going into defense mode), stay the course.  The shilling of BCH is what they want. It’s publicity.  Don’t give a kid throwing a tantrum a lolly pop.

This is like the car analogy I mentioned.  Yet, probably should have used Honda versus Porsche instead to be more drastic.  Both advertise that they are superior vehicles.  Despite the multi million dollar ad campaigns we see everyday, we all know which one is the superior product.  IMO, it’s like watching Porsche continually making statements about how Honda is a fake knock off as their primary advertising objective.  In the end, it actually makes Porsche look bad and makes people consider the “other option”.

Umm... say 200 survive, but there are over 1,500 coins currently listed.  Some of them are already dead.  So, 200/1,500 surviving technically makes “most of them will collapse” a very reasonable statement.
Let’s say thousands survive, this is also going to come with 10s of thousands created.  Either way, GS made a pretty fair statement.

And that’s with a bail out!!!  Just imagine what would have happened without that influx of instant liquidity!!
So, I’d say crypto is doing pretty well. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 23:11:41
But what if you paid your taxes on your crypto investments?
@_date: 2018-04-24 16:01:45
This makes me sad
@_date: 2019-05-14 01:35:13
Did you ever consider traveling in a lambo?
@_date: 2019-05-14 00:45:55
Everyone knows a car purchase is the best investment you can make these days. I’m shocked at these non-lambo related suggestions.
@_date: 2019-05-14 01:16:47
We need more free thinkers like this in this sub
@_date: 2019-05-14 02:43:33
How about no longer having to work cause you are set for life, traveling the world picking up chicks on Tinder, in a lambo?
@_date: 2019-05-14 05:13:06
Slap a bull sticker over that stallion and I think you are in business

Why would you need $2 mil at 65 yrs old if you could risk your life in a lambo next year?

Are you only shooting for upper middle class?
