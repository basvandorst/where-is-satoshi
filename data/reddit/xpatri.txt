With one possible caveat:
regional adoption velocity (in some countries faster acceptance can be ignited by retaliation to repressive currency controls - e.g. Argentina is trying to dodge that bullet, but they have other, bigger issues driving their abandonment of currency controls.)
    And, from the annals of social psychology
 (Asimov first suggested the semantically incorrect term "psychohistory" I prefer sociophysics), we know that humans have what is termed 'catastrophic' behaviour under stress (economic stress, regulatory stress, social stress etc.).
Read the excellent book [Snapping: America's Epidemic of Sudden Personality Change]( it refers to America but such theory applies anywhere that has any kind of widespread electronic communications. 
The uptake in regions can accelerate violently under the right conditions. No doubt this kind of event is still in the future, but it may not be that long before we begin to see such things.
      Governments around the globe are legislating their economies to death right before our very eyes.

If this is correct then someone should make this a daily headline in order to squelch any worries - most ordinary business folk are very averse to change of any sort, let alone the kind of change that directly involves their wallet.

Gold never forks.  
Buy gold (AUG) with your BTC,  
 hodl until the fork is over and you begin to hear the screams from the losing side.  
No worries about missing any big rebounds, no one serious will be buying much until the fork is a historic footnote.

!-Astonishing excellence.  
One question:  
It says "PrivatePackets.io

Maybe I need new eyeballs, but where can I find the note ? I scrolled and checked under the sheet FAQs, but no joy...(I even scanned the linked website but no see)

This is a shocker that no one knows you can do BTC-AUG and AUG-BTC in (almost) real time, like I have been doing with no issues for the past 6 months.
    Maybe Google can help you out with that ?

This seems to be a possible answer to my previous [question](
 but details about how the currency works are not obvious just yet - not sure just how MSK is generated or provides security/fungibility etc.
Sounds like fun, anyway, for a handful of dust what could possibly go awry ....

This is actually a very good question as those of us who might do business with someone are best reassured knowing they make profit adequate to _continue_ providing good services.
But I see they have answered, so I guess it is time to check it out...

all I needed to work out was how to type    `  ^]  `    
For anyone late to this party and using debian maybe:
     escape key   =   CTRL-[   =   ^[
and then
      the other side of that is CTRL-]   =    ^]
which translates the preceding instruction to type:
     CTRL-] quit &lt;ENTER&gt;
to exit the telnet session properly

You mean, like [what governments have already attempted ?](
It would be ridiculously difficult to do in some places such as the USA or parts of Europe, but it is almost as easy a turning off the power to a few key portals in many nations... some may think this impossible but the shenanigans of government meddling causes a lot of misery worldwide already.
Some states have an agenda that already goes far beyond just DNS poison, simply blocking port 53, and redirecting https traffic and currently includes taking down VPN.

nobody thinks any governments would ever cut internet access, except me I suppose. Maybe I am a bit silly, but I have been sitting ~here~ for the past few months watching exactly that unfold as fast as it can be achieved. It is happening somewhere as you read this...

Please clarify -  
* you wish to run your PC using Electrum stored in the USB as a directory - is easy to config by yourself
* you wish to run any PC using an OS stored on the USB which has Electrum loaded into it 
like these:  
* 
* which leads to this 
* and is discussed here   
and probably safer just to load any old linux live distro on a key, cull any bloatware (libreoffice and whatnot)
 and install the latest Electrum image (keep it updated) I can recommend Sabayon or Solydx or Debian for that

It is amazing how many bitcoiners fail to understand how important credibility is.  
Imagine that bitcoin is the bagman for a mafia chief and the bagman develops a habit of doing a song-and-dance routine on the way to the bank with a sack full of money, performing breakdance routines on top of handrails and backflipping across busy intersections through traffic against red lights.   
His career might not end with a full pension...

The forkers are trying to run off with the everything bag.  


The forkers should just be starting a new alt-coin and demonstrate from scratch the superiority of their own device. If it works as well as they say it does then it should fling itself into high gear in no time at all.  
Because, however, they are trying to take the entire BTC market capitalization by brute force this shows they are not willing to eat their own dog-food.

Me too - it took 8 (eight) days to clear,    
 but it did eventually clear,    
 days after the receiver had declared the transaction 'failed'.    
My first inclination was to upgrade and see if the option to resend    
 was something that might still be possible (probably not ?)    
but it is not something I would enjoy a second time around.    
The fee you paid almost guarantees that    
 the transaction will eventually be abandoned,    
 but be warned that this may not be not universally true.    
My fee was under 80,    
 and at that moment it was utterly unviable.    
But not much stands still for very long in BTCland.

In other words,    
bankers do not want you to be able to withdraw what you deposited.    
Sounds like any bank:     
deposit, and forget about getting it all back.
