One of our smart team members said bitcoin is bigger then craig or any one person now during the podcast... I agree with both of you.

Shame  about SQRL Research and their exit scam but lets not all forget about  the BCU scam they pulled too. Remember all those custom bitstreams we  where going to have access too due to them hard coding a private key  into the cards for exclusive access to sqrl research and mineoraty built  bitstreams.....
Thanks for building new hardware and trying to  scam us all again instead of finishing the work on the hardware you  already sold us. [\ [\ [\ [\ [\ [\

no refund for us yet although they are claiming they will... we will see

seems like a very short sighted approach while  having that much money. Those are rookie numbers you gotta pump those up.

the funding of former projects and my experience with the whitepaper og's have taught me the same thing

you're really cute white knighting for sqrl like this i'll make sure to link these back and include you in our doc on the subject. Can we get you for a interview over the phone or skype ?

you mean they lied about what the hardware does and broke laws in doing so. They also positioned for a scam exit due to the shit storm coming down instead of making good for their clients on the acorns. There is more then meets the eyes [
