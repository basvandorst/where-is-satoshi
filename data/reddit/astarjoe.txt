@_date: 2016-08-25 23:43:20
True, but with emerging technology like sidechains, LN, layer 2 apps, POS scalability and clearing times will become less and less a factor. Which really makes using bitcoin, even with a QR code, pretty much the same as this. Not to mention NFC and other capabilities which could be used to make this even more seamless. 
I think what I am pointing out is that the reasons to use bitcoin, even at POS are becoming less and less, or perhaps, less so than some new readers might think. Particularly when the largest retailer in the world is using something as clumsy as a QR code at POS to transact!

Because if you think that others are going to somehow beat Bitcoin to this market and that we need to invent a shitty bandaid to rectify this problem then you should examine what makes Bitcoin useful absolutely in the first place: immutability, decentralization, censorship resistance, 21 million coin limit, proof of work algorithm with predictable issuance rate.

Segwit, Increased blocksize (yes, it's coming to bitcoin), Bech32, MAST, Schnorr signatures, Lightning, etc... all contribute to easing the overall congestion and free up space for regular transactions, too. 
The main point is that this is the intelligent way to do things. The engineer's way. Making things smaller, not larger on the main chain so that it stays relevant and solid for layer upon layer to be innovated on top of it. 
You'll live to see the day of completely anonymous, encrypted end to end payments on the blockchain for little to no fee. All this competition drives the fee market down to the marginal price of 0.

Hard to say. Very many undoubtedly. People haven't really come to the realization yet that software development specifically for scaling often happens in layers on top of something solid and concrete. That solid layer, for many of us, is the bitcoin blockchain. The quick innovation happening on top of it will solve our scaling problems and once this sinks in, I'd suspect that most alts will be annihilated. 
What is the point of an alt if it is built on a tenuous, readily forked base chain... when innovation built on something proven and rocksteady over the period of a decade or so is happening? There really is no point, to me at least. 
Edit: [Here's what I mean](
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:59:49


Number one, nobody was buying anything from Microsoft using bitcoin, anyway... this was just a marketing ploy to begin with. 
But have you thought about the fact that Core developers are thoughtfully, purposefully designing systems that ready Bitcoin for 2nd layer functions (such as Lightning Network) that making Bitcoin useful and even preferable for retail transactions?
On chain transactions for retail just aren't there yet and this much is obvious, because they bloat the blockchain and require measures of centralization (increased bandwidth usage and storage) to solve- eg bcash. What is telling to me is how the Bitcoin developer community is not in a rush to action to solve the problem with quick bandaids and panicked solutions that sacrifice Bitcoin's core tenets of immutability and censorship resistance. They understand that these facets must be preserved at all costs for Bitcoin to maintain it's purpose. 
2nd and 3rd layer solutions are the way to attack this "retail adoption" meme, which, in my view, is just that, as most people really have no pressing urge to spend bitcoins for coffee and so forth, because right now, the system is much better purposed for other uses, such as storing value outside the legacy financial system. 
Only much later, when Bitcoin has become more ubiquitous, will actual mainstream adoption drive demand for retail solutions for joe schmoe millenial lemming consumer. Meanwhile, Core developers will have had taken their time designing processes such as Segwit, that lay the groundwork for this, and will be perfectly positioned to leverage them. 
Case in point, [watch Roger Ver try to sell bitcoin retail adoption to an average joe Schmoe grocery store owner]( in, "The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin" documentary. It's a joke. Roger is earnest and well-intentioned, but the idea is just a joke to the guy, who really has no interest in exposing himself to a payment system that is not driven by innate demand from the people. It works fine for Roger, but it isn't ready for most others. Only Roger would sell bitcoin to some grocer using a bitcoin wallet (Blockchain.info) whose main graphic is a damned Rubick's Cube (at the time). As if Bitcoin wasn't puzzling enough to the avg consumer already, heh.

Speaking in terms of cryptocurrencies, I think it's possible to devise ways to have both the bank grade security and freedom of fungibility that most people need. 
Really, now that money is essentially a type of permissionless digital content (like MP3s, zip files, etc) innovation and competition can drive the security aspect down to the lowest marginal price. So "be your own bank" now comes with some risk, but 5 years from now what will the overall security and ease of use picture look like? As an early adopter who has seen the monumental growth in ease of use since bitcoin's beginning... I'd say it will look a helluva lot different. And in a good way.

Pumping and manipulating an altcoin market would be sooo easy using this ridiculous rating system.

Meanwhile, interns at said company will get rich hand over fist trading whatever coin they happen to "like" for the day. 
It's basically the tail wagging the dog ,imo. Practically all the coins they listed are shit, won't amount to crap, just like any other ICO or startup. And yet, they somehow are able to put their ears to the railroad tracks well enough to rate the entire ecosystem of that coin.

So the Argentinian peso is not money because it is extremely volatile and had a devaluation event of 65% in a single day? 
Look, Bitcoin is money because it is solving problems for real people in the real world today. This isn't some fancy experiment anymore. You don't have to recognize it, you don't have to even care about it because it doesn't matter. It matters to the people that *do use it*. And for them it *is* money. Which is interesting because for many economists, human problems exist as an abstract concept on a graph. With bitcoin, people now have a choice; competition in the realm of currency, where governments have no say in what they use or how they transact. 
Also, opportunity cost. Again real people, real problems. If my health care requires addressing, you better damn well believe that I will value this above the future value of some of my bitcoins. If I really want to improve the quality of my life with a new house *now*, and I value this above the future cost of my bitcoins, I will use them. The value of my bitcoins have much less appeal to me if I am dead. 
The important part is that bitcoin doesn't care about any of this. It functions and people use it, no matter what anyone says. Volatility or no, bitcoin forgot to ask for permission. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:49:29
Whoosh. The whole point was to illustrate that Ver challenged him for not being a millionaire. 
But as far as your argument about Bitcoin as currency, perhaps you'd like to be me and take a step back to 2013 and see how far we've come since then and then go on to ask yourself, where do you see this technology in 5-10 years? 
In 2013-14 there was ONE bitcoin exchange, MTGOX, and it was hacked, and yet, Bitcoin somehow, mysteriously survived. Based on the amount of infrastructure and gains we've had since then, I'd say it will be a very exciting ride these next few years. Then we'll see how well your point holds up.

Also, OP, why did you not just send your crypto directly to an exchange, particularly if you were selling ALL of it in one go? Instead you elected to move it to electrum first? Sounds quite odd to me...
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:10:43
You're probably too young but do you remember the [ridiculously long fight scene from the movie, "They Live" by John Carpenter](
The scene was a metaphor for how people's minds, once made up, are incredibly resistant to disruptive ideas and change. And they will fight you to stay in their sphere of traditional tranquility. Asleep in the Matrix, as it were. Comfortable in a system designed to keep them perfectly docile, in place, and conforming. 
When Steve Jobs said, ["Think Different"]( it wasn't just some trite catchphrase or cliche. It was a way of life for him, a philosphy which allowed him to pioneer disruptive technologies and ideas without fear of failure. 
Such fear holds back many baby boomers and older types. This is natural. Expect it and embrace it for unfortunately, many of these people will be left behind when cryptocurrency becomes mainstream and bitcoin is selling for $500,000 or more per coin. 
Bitcoin and blockchain are the most disruptive ideas in the history of currency and money. They are also very difficult concepts to understand. When you start talking about disintermediating broad swaths of the economy, and allowing international transactions without recourse to authority or government due to radical innovative technologies like Bitcoin, you're going to piss off and frankly terrify *a lot* of people. 
And that's a good thing.

Having your bank accounts digitally frozen or automatically garnisheed would defeat the entire point of this crypto cash. Not to mention territorial and political issues disallowing transmission elswhere in the world. And not to mention that with such a system you have effectively ceded complete and total control of our financial life to whoever holds the keys (gov) to your e-dollars.

I was also transacting at the time in question and I *never* recall anything near $100 fees. And using a ridiculous outlier like the Bcash attack (which I believe it to be) is not a fair comparison with respect to comparing Bitcoin overall to WU. It's like taking WU during a period of system outage or downtime and taking that brief period of time as your sample period. Not fair. And Bitcoin has been around farrr less with much less time to develop. 
I believe Lightning and other tech will change these scalability problems, as they are computing issues to research, understand and overcome, as we are in the process of doing. Meanwhile, with WU, everything stays pretty static, with most of the real problems in money transmission mired in geopolitical control and international laws which Bitcoin still bypasses.

Bitcoin has been around for 8 years. Of course there is going to be some volatility. The peso is a failed currency, but it is a currency by your own admission. The difference here is that people didn't have a choice, whether it be in Venezuela, Cyprus, Ukraine, Argentina, or [Zimbabwe]( as to what to use because the government had a monopoly on how people could usefully transact. That is obviously no longer the case, and this is one of the main contributing factors to Bitcoin's rise. 
At the end of the day, at the risk of sounding rude, (which I do not want to do) it doesn't matter what you think. Bitcoin is *in use because it is useful to people*. They are using it and therefore it is serving the effective functions of money regardless of how many [breathless PhDs stammer on about how it cannot do this or that through the years](  


Wait what? You are comparing a premined altcoin that is admittedly (by their own community) used mainly as a smart contracts fuel rather than a store of value or means to transact a more effective alternative to bitcoin? An altcoin that hardforks so often due to flagrant and capricious coding errors that it is getting hard to keep track?? You are incredibly... wrong. Where can you spend Ethereum? I show you where you can spend bitcoin:


Regulation doesn't matter in terms of the core usage of bitcoin. Bitcoin use is a free speech matter and therefore serves a litmus test for tyrannical governments. 


Show me how you can teleport a hundred million mathematically verifiable in physical across the globe and have it confirmed delivery instantly, with further confirmations within the hour? 
Bitcoin is a perfectly fine medium of exchange, and it is also one that is subject to optimizations. So arguing for what bitcoin is, or will be, is a bit moot, as what we know today as "big B" Bitcoin may look drastically different in 5 or 10 years to what we know today. Upgrading money. Now that's an idea that is disruptive. 
@_date: 2018-09-16 21:09:11
Wow, hysterics much? And no, I won't pls for 2 payea mai staek monies with this ignorant medium screed.
Jerry Brito and Coincenter deeply understand Bitcoin and what they have done is *actually* reach out to other members of the public that Beautyon cares less about but who nonetheless exist: regulators. Specifically, ensuring that they are *educated* on important matters related to Bitcoin so that disasters like Bitlicense do not happen again. 
Again, it's about *educating* regulators and informing them before potential mistakes and rushes to judgement happen. This is the way adults handle themselves, but OP's article was clearly written by a person with the temper of a whiny 13 year old. 
If, Beautyon, Bitcoin is fragile enough to be truly threatened by these types of "associations" which, I agree, are typically insignificant, then it doesn't really deserve to exist in the first place. However, I have seen nothing but reasoned and impassioned input from Coincenter since their founding, encouraging regulators to understand and use Bitcoin rather than lash out at it with the temper of the article you posted. 
Similarly, that would be a mistake. So obviously, people have the freedom to associate and make organizations like these but everyone knows that clearly, after the S2X debacle it is far, far FAR too late for anyone to overtly control and upend Bitcoin now. 
That ship has sailed, it's simply too powerful. So why not educate?

So basically you have 2 days to notice that someone is attempting to steal your bitcoins. Not bad for your basic long term storage solution for someone new to bitcoin, in my eyes.

You're completely missing the point. 
The salient issue here is that corporations and governments are capable of overtly or covertly rendering useless any or all of a citizen's income sources without any sort of due process or democratic foundation. 
Should you find yourself at the opposite end of the political spectrum and suddenly a target of such an effort, your opinion on the matter would change damn fast. If all your income flows through Paypal and suddenly this is not an option, whether conservative or progressive, that will cause you financial pain. 
The issue is that we, as a democracy, have adopted a financial system that is favorable to tyrants and abuse. It is fundamanetally *biased* and unfair to all participants, as Wikileaks found out with their Visa ban. 
Bitcoin aims to re-democratize money by making it open to all, so that *all view points* can be heard and funded (if the open marketplace finds value in them). Not squelched by regulators or backroom deals in the corporate boardroom because somebody or the other found your views "infammatory". 
We don't need to be shielded from "inflammatory views". Inflammatory views are WHAT BUILT THIS NATION and should be open to expression without fear of being cut off from the financial system. This is outright tyranny through alternate channels.

The financial system is fundamentally flawed by allowing politicians to get a hand in back channeling your financial demise through processes which are fundamentally unjust or biased, with nothing to do with actual fact finding. 
Bitcoin aims to solve that.

If you are new to r/bitcoin please note:
This kind of nonsense pops up after every moderate dip. What happens is people short bitcoin on certain exchanges, and often attempt to get people to sell into downward price momentum by posting in social media circles, where lots of bitcoiners get their news. 
These traders hope to leverage this momentum to buy at the bottom and when the next wave tops out, they sell again, often in large quantities (as we recently saw) and the process repeats itself.

Everything in Bitcoin is a contrarian indicator. Everything. If someone unequivocally says that things are picking up, they're about to crash. If the state of the Bitcoin network is as strong as it has ever been, the market will crash. 
All that matters are whales jumping in and out of the water to manipulate the market and they do so at their timing and discretion. Everyone else will get recked save the long term hodlr's and that requires patience and discipline, something lacking these days (whales know this).

Don't get dragged down into the ridiculous conversation. R3 is about putting you in a digital walled garden where you, in a cashless society, submit your earnings to a consortium of "trusted third parties" who insist that they know how to handle your money better than you do. They also retain the ability to track each and every one of your transactions with ultimate clarity, and freeze or withhold your funds at will. God help you, if you find yourself on some kind of "list" the likes of which are spreading everywhere these days, from France, to the UK, to the US. And none of these "lists" require any sort of due process, just infinite extensions to various iterations of the Patriot act/CISA. 
The greatest attribute of bitcoin is it's ability to separate value transfer and financial innovation away from these entities and put it back into the hands of the people. Oh wait, that was pretty libtard of me to say.

Ideas and notions like these make me want to hurl, because the basic premise behind bitcoin is an unregulated, unleashed free market driven ethos. Competitive forces previously unseen will emerge from places that aren't depicted in your vastly shortsighted model.

You don't understand the illiquidity of this market. No one, figuratively speaking, knows about bitcoin (yet). 
One small splash by a "whale club"creating momentum shifts in response to the media/perception are merely speculative opportunities for traders at this time. Great examples of this are the Greek default (which I doubt will actually happen), and the Coinbase exchange announce pop to 300 a few months ago. 
All were sold off shortly thereafter with traders cashing in on the buy ins of the media hype train victims. 
Rinse, repeat, until the bitcoin adoption explosion happens at which point all bets are off and you'll see a rise in price unlike anything ever seen. At which point all of the unemployed, underachieving day traders living out of their parents' basements in Queens will have their short positions annihilated and they will be forced back to the unemployment line or back flipping burgers at Wendy's.

Oh you mean like the New Black Panther Party did in 2008 at polling places:




That kind of violence? 
And yet, there on the Black Panther website plain for all the world to see, is a quite profitable merchant store, with easily accessible payment channels through Paypal. Absurd. the double standard and hypocrisy is just plain ridiculous. 
And as to "protected class" did that help Sarah Sanders avoid getting rudely kicked out of a restaurant with her family just because the proprietor didn't feel like serving her? That kind of protected class? So let's really delve into this whole victimology thing, I think you're pretty good at it. 
[Or maybe we should scour Twitter feeds for the endless death threats that the president Donald J. Trump received during and after the election cycle.]( Shall we go through and dissolve the Paypal and banking relationships of all those people a priori without due process simply because the statement was extremely provacative and threatened of direct violence or death pending a full investigation by law enforcement? 
The whole idea here is that Bitcoin was designed to democratize and negate all these processes and provide a fundamentally neutral system for money so that these issues can be rectified through the justice system first, without people fearing whether their "wrongthink" will finish them and their families financially. 
A populace constantly harried and worried by the government for wrongthink is not a free an open society at all. It is a cowed, blithe pitiful excuse for living and no human ought to have to endure these kinds of tyrannies.

They are doing that because no one has any incentive to pay with bitcoin or use it in their day to day lives. 
Just because bitcoin *can* function as a currency for everyday use does not necessarily mean that this will be its killer app, so to speak. 
Did you *really* think that people would rise up, and spontaneously use this volatile, new experimental technology to represent the value of their work by sheer altruistic enterprise? Did you expect some sort of "viral" marketing campaign to sway their faith in the dollar or whatever local currency that they use in favor of bitcoin? This is absurd. 
From a psychological standpoint, most people are averse to using bitcoin. Particularly when merchants aren't keen on passing along discounts or even properly advertising or marketing the bitcoin discounts that they do have. So there is *no incentive* for people to overcome all the technological barriers to entry that exist in this space. Bitcoin is still too hard and complex for the vast majority of people. 
If bitcoin is to succeed, it will be because the early adopters and developers provide a stable, innovative, and usable store of wealth for entrepreneurs, speculators and holders to use. Once people see that the value can rise based off of a tried and true tech, they will eventually come around; and then only after many, many, UI and useability improvements will they adopt bitcoin as an everyday currency. 
Bitcoin's blockchain tech provides enormous value (as a settlement mechanism, universal source of truth, a form of "anonymous" value exchange, etc.) to certain industries and it will be those kinds of users  together with early adopters who invest in this concept to be the ones who we should consider carefully. Considering too heavily this theoretical mainstream adoption that occurs out of nowhere is reaching a bit, I think.

Think about this for a moment. 
We live in a world where people, smart people, such as your mom, are so preconditioned to *rely* on the government for guidance *first* on what to do, what to think, what to wear, what to *be*. They have persuaded themselves that innovation and human enterprise must be first vetted and approved by the state. Is that living? Or is that self imposed slavery?
Are you ok with that premise? What do you think of the viability of a civilization whose main source of innovative leadership and direction is a powerful, central state? A state in which many of the "leaders" obtain their power through coddling large corporate entities while spewing endless pandering to the people as misdirection.
I'd say your mom is firmly entrenched in the Matrix, and that you might do a fair bit of educating her on the hows and whys of the value of a free thinking people and free market capitalism. 
If we wait for the government's opinion on everything before innovating, were *done* as a civilization. Period. This is one of the true beauties of bitcoin- it allows innovation without permission in a fintech space that has been ruled by firmly entrenched incumbents for the last century. 
It exists and thrives *in spite* of mechanisms that will act unfairly, possibly illegally, treacherously, to inhibit its progress. Now *that* is a radical and exciting technology, and something that mankind needs in this day and age. Check it out, kid.

Bitcoin is a 10 year old system. He's comparing it to a centuries old dollar backed by trillions in debt and derivatives. Pretty unfair comparison. Bitcoin has done much better than many emerging market national currencies. 
Also, he creates strawmen of "scammers" and "exchanges", which have nothing to do with Bitcoin itself. But hey, who's paying attention to important details anyway, as long as we get to make fun of libertarians, right?
Pretty immature. Bitcoin has succeeded in spite of everything. In spite of every prognosticator, PhD, expert and pundit. And meanwhile, JP Morgan has attempted to patent the blockchain idea of Bitcoin over 200 times and been denied. 
Bitcoin demonstrates an ability to maintain its system, since 2008 with practically zero downtime, open to attack 24/7 by the most sophisticated adversaries known to man. It has presented a provably scarce unit of account which is completely transparent and backed by the computational collaboration of thousands of nodes all of which enforce the rules without an intermediary. Allowing fast-clearing (actually clearing-not credit card clearing, which takes up to 28 days), anywhere there is an internet connection in the world.

There's a huge difference and it is disappointing that people still don't recognize the stark differences. 
For example, Bitcoin has been under attack, since the beginning- by some of the most sophisticated adversaries known to man. 
It has existed, nay, thrived even under incredible duress, even from within it's own ranks at times. It has persisted in ascending the slope of mainstream adoption even in spite of the most [vicious and pervasive propaganda]( ever seen by any currency or financial system. 
And all the while it has persisted in growing both in the security of the codebase and increase in the underlying fundamentals such as hash rate security increase, and mathematically provable and transparent upgrade practices that are exposed to the [scrutiny of the open market and competition](  
One of the problems for old school financial types and grognards of the legacy financial system is that this statement is inaccurate, while every single metric of the [housing bubble was faked, false and built on a mountain of lies]( which was aided and enabled by the incumbent system from the very beginning (mountains of easy credit, debt, money printing, artificially low interest rates, etc).

They can't. This is proof of *authority* versus Bitcoin's proof of work. 


If you introduce one single published misprint in the New York Times across all issuances you just invalidated every hashed instance prior to that in the chain. Now you're forced to go back and hand validate everything based on.. what.. oh right.. the internal records of the company, which could easily be tampered with again. 
This isn't really a blockchain. It's an internal ledger relying on the proof of authority of a centralized service. Nothing to prevent judicial orders, subpoenas, or even black market pressure/collusion to introduce dramatic faults into this distribution system. You also have massive security concerns and concentration of risk with the sole keys residing with Surety. 
The beauty of Bitcoin, on the other hand, is that the entire ledger is entirely decentralized and peer to peer in its distribution nature. And that it resides completely independent of other instances or copies of it on other computers, so any one can independently, then collectively verify the results. Digitally, instantly, worldwide. No need to have a "proof of New York Times" to decide who is telling the truth.
If involvement in politics has taught any of us anything in this new digital age, it's that no one can be trusted, no one. The world needs a distributed ledger to verify history from a neutral, transnational access point. That's Bitcoin's blockchain.

Oh, and Bitcoin is innovative and can create jobs in a new digital economy (extremely minor emphasis). 
All that crap and no mention of threatening Bitcoin's core exchange or fungibility. Why? Because they can't affect it.

I disagree. I think that harnessing new users (read:data streams) is a great way for Google to go. Opening up an additional channel of value transfer is essentially a beta test for the future of money. If it takes off, they have made an investment, if not, they remove the capability. 
They lose nothing by enabling it. They gain data, and they feed off of it to make deterministic decisions  about their products. These products are more likely to succeed based off of this (more robust) data. 
Plus, they gain marketing joy though the announcement, which is, essentially, free advertising.

I think that this announcement has to mean Bitcoin. What else could it be?
 It couldn't be Applecoin, such an attempt from the control-minded walled garden that is Apple is highly unlikely. Why? Because control. Control of a fluid user experience from top to bottom is paramount to Apple. And bootstrapping their own worldwide currency exposes their brand to so many untold vulnerabilities in this manner. They would have to design POS systems, secure wallets, transmission systems, security, publicity, and oh by the way.. a new currency itself. And for what? A totally centralized, top down, inflationary, hackable shitcoin? 
Too many damn pitfalls, when they could just adopt a third party agnostic system such as Bitcoin. If Bitcoin fails, Apple is fine. If Applecoin fails, it deeply affects the Apple brand. And if you think this announcement if purely for ancillary altcoins, Linden Dollars, or game tokens I think you are sorely mistaken.

Of course it isn't a literal virus, but it sort of acts like one given the current financial situation. 
And it's much more than a speculative commodity. It's a transport layer for an entirely new way of envisioning trust in a trustless world (current events very much related). How do you put a price on trust? How do you put a price on ledger entries that are immutable? What commodity in the past bears any resemblance to this such that you would even have any intellectual standing to call it a "commodity" in the first place? Just because the government classifies it as a commodity for the purposes of pigeonholing it to ensure that it is taxed and stifled (this was the whole reasoning behind the CFTC classifying it this way-and not as a "currency" as the crypto community had wanted), doesn't mean that it is one. 
What commodity bears any actual resemblance to Bitcoin? Not gold. gold is easily tainted and made impure (just ask the Canadian central bank whose bars were discovered impure). What argument do you have that Bitcoin isn't more like a virus in relation to the current system than a traditional commodity?

Bitcoin is freedom. You express the value of your hard work, your sweat and effort the way you want to, not because of the mandate of some financial/governmental entity. 
Thus, it is natural and expected that many governments will fear the onset of a system that allows the citizenry to escape from financial slavery. The slaves are revolting. 
Bitcoin is a litmus test for showing which governments truly respect the will of the people versus those that seek to keep them financially burdened by a decrepit, inflated, debt based fiat money system.

You realize no serious investor would consider hopping on to this payment system when it is currently under (or even perceived to be under) threat. I know Andreas thinks otherwise, but few outside of the community know about him or appreciate his position. You miners better be careful or pretty soon you may have a warehouse full of very useless silicon.  
Free market forces have a way of shoving a figurative knife into the neck of people that engage in short term solutions to long term problems, and/or turning their back on core development for problems like these. Miners should be paying back to the community of devs who can potentially fix this problem. Are they?

Why? Because the Chinese are masters at the fine art of deception. Why can't the average person recognize this? Has no one read Sun Tsu's Art of War? 
At the end of the day, a million arabs passing through Dubai on their way to the Riviera will be perfectly happy to move their wealth around instantly with Bitcoin. We don't need China's moronic flailing about with the challenges of an open society. They will learn the hard way, eventually.

My take is that the PBOC will not kill BTC in China. It may move it into more stable hands. Into Black and grey markets dominated by the wealthy and party elites. Facilitating offshore wealth transfers and sophisticated deals between bigger players. I should think that this would drive up the price considerably. In essence, moving BTC from less steady hands. It may stifle growth because it is illegal, but I think true players can make BTC move even in light of this. Please feel free to correct me if I am way off base here...

Participation should be voluntary at first. Why not allow the seal of approval to go to those companies that decide to participate in that scheme? This would allow the ecosystem to mature naturally, and allow for more right-minded regulation in an organic fashion. 
Jumping to extremes like this is just dangerous. If like you say, the banks had a part to play in this section, then they are looking at driving out innovation. NY regulators need to recognize that a recent study by The Brookings Institute [shows]( that millenials value cash more, are less trusting of banks and large Wall Street institutions, AND are going to be the largest american demographic. As compelling or possibly [more so]( is the fact that millenials are eschewing application for or working in the centralized financial sector. They are even shunning traditional baby-boomer investments and stocks. 
Do you know what millenials DO understand? Digital stuff. Phones, tablets, Bitcoin. They get it. We are witnessing a generational shift in not just finance, but the generation needed to push that shift into lightspeed. Coupled with (in my view) unstable world conditions, likely hyperinflation, and increased inefficiencies with traditional fiat currency, we are at the perfect historical crux for a pivotal change in how the world works, and the financial systems that exist within it.

Bitcoin is having an interesting effect. Since it represents a way to do exchange and hold value outside of the realm of central banking authority and traditional finance systems, an escape outlet is created. They don't want that. So it becomes synonymous with freedom. Do you want your liberty, or do you want security. Choose, because we won't let you have both.

Piece ends with a blatant shill of Ripple and the Citibank meme of altering crypto to suit financial regulators. 
Gotta go take a break from this. Blood pressure rising. Journalists don't seem to get it that Bitcoin will succeed for *precisely* the reasons they say will make it fail: totalitarian governments hate it, financial regulators are confounded by it and want to regulate it, anonymity, lack of any central authority or control. Bitcoin relies on none of those things to succeed, and in fact, works around them.
There will come a time when people will yearn for capital flight outlets and safe harbors for their earnings that lie outside of the realm of what we today know as the Fed-managed legacy banking system. Bitcoin presents that alternative and more... and I wish more journalists would get that. I wish they would recognize that Bitcoin presents us a way to *fight* the system without having to resort to violence.
So whenever I see these students protesting in China, or people vainly marching in Missouri, I think, perhaps they should consider fighting the system by exiting it.

"Public ledger" by banks, heh. As if they would ever want to collude to expose their balance sheets to each other and the public at large. 
Such a system, in my view, would help serve to validate the technology behind Bitcoin, and thereby boost its value by several orders of magnitude. Further, this system would not be used as a store of value or unit of account, but merely a shuttle on which ever-inflating dollars would ride. 
Banks would also need to find a way to monetize it and charge appropriate fees for their services, while Bitcoin itself remains open source, secured, and essentially free. Not to mention truly worldwide.. circumnavigating borders, banks, and governments. 
Nothing can sanction it, nothing can really regulate it. As Antonopolous mentioned at the SF Bitcoin conference.. you step on the gecko and it becomes a komodo dragon that bites your foot off. While instantly spreading many venomous varieties that are individually impossible to control as well.

That is fascinating to me, because as an arch-conservative, I feel much the same way. 
Conservative principles seek to be "conservative" with the role of government in people's lives. Less (where possible) is more, so to speak.
To me, Bitcoin is at the very foundation of this idea. Self governance, private property rights, individual liberty. This is what conservatism, true conservatism, not the neocon Bush/Cheney/McConell/Mcain republicanism dribble represents. Republicans of today are *not* conservatives, they are statists. 
Just keep in mind that one should not let down their guard with respect to the role of governments in shaping Bitcoin's ultimate fate. If mandated to be tied to a permanent identity, Bitcoin could morph into the biggest central government tracking mechanism the world has ever seen.

Since, of course, bitcoin is divisible to 8 decimal places this is not a problem in the slightest.

If you can electronically send dollars via the various middle man institutions in the international remittance network, then one would think that a far easier (and cheaper) way to do this would be to instead verify transactions using the (cost free) trust implicit in the blockchain to use small amounts of Bitcoin as "shuttles of trust" for dollars, thus allowing you to make a business around verifying dollars on each end with signed Bitcoin transactions. 
Send a million dollars from the US to AUS. Fine, all it takes is a signed micropayment digitally attached to the business' ledger that attaches it to that payment and that payment alone. Boom, done. 
All the blockchain is about, as I see it, is autonomous, effective, super low cost trust, which allows people to streamline transaction intermediaries, and do tons of other interesting things that do not involve people or expensive systems of trust to support them. 
Am I wrong on this? Can this not be done? I mean, if Counterparty can create user generated assets like oil, and wine, then why cant a user generated asset be a dollar, and use that blockchain transaction to verify the correct amount of those dollars on each end of the business' customer pipeline.

The mere idea that you could integrate tasks in Star Citizen such as running cargo in your ship for real world Bitcoin literally makes my spine tingle. And as we know Star Citizen will have a tremendously developed economy in its MMORPG universe, or "verse" as they call it. Fortunately, the game will be in development for quite some time to come, so it is yet possible to implement something like this I bet. 
Edit: They were truly innovative with a unique crowd funding drive for the entire game development through the users/donators so they are obviously open to innovative new ideas. Not to mention their fan base is $50 million worth of donations thus far and counting. A lot of people are interested in that game.

Because the Bitcoin blockchain is the trusted counterparty. So with a pure Bitcoin transaction you do not need legal recourse- you just wait for the appropriate number of confirmations. That is the whole point of Bitcoin: to eliminate the need for an escrow or middleman. With BTCJam you assume all of the counterparty risk with no legal recourse if someone decides not to stiff you for the loan(s) you contribute to. And it is hilarious that BTCJam titles them, "investments".

I was surprised that he waited so damn long to bring up transaction fees as a part of the solution. I  mean, its written by Satoshi in the white paper as a sustainability mechanism when the block rewards diminish. And yes, I think transaction fees being slightly higher for bitcoin 2.0 transactions (colored coins) does not sound like a bad idea to incentivize miners to include them.

So this allows for a true "Internet of things" that consists of a network of devices/appliances/machines that just listen over radio. They need not have any Internet connectivity at all. 
So now you have the possibility for remote, decentralized things like washing machines, parking meters, coffee machines, vending machines, gas pumps, taxi cabs, damn near anything you can dream of as an innovator, if I am understanding this right. 
One of the most beautiful things about making money into a content type is that now entire layers of remote innovation can occur wherever you can propagate some 1s and 0s. This is the simple beauty of Bitcoin and digital money that I wish more lay people truly grasped.

Well considering a board member, Brock Pierce, is pushing an alt coin that directly competes with Bitcoin in 2/3 of the functions of money, that is, unit of account (realcoin vs bitcoin), store of value (dollar vs Bitcoin), I think that a strong conflict of interest is potentially present in the foundation. 
It might be more appropriate to say that now we have a "Blockchain foundation", since a board member (Brock Pierce) is likely to cast Bitcoin itself in a secondary light with emphasis on his own company and coin. Note: he mentioned in the WSJ piece that "I'm not selling any of my Bitcoins", as if to preemptively dismiss the notion. But if you have to mention it, you're thinking that someone else is thinking that, Brock. Which leads the reader to believe that there is the possibility within the community that realcoin is perceived as a threat.
JP Morgan Chase or the vampire squid was supposed to introduce dollarcoin. Not a boardmember of the Bitcoin foundation!

It isn't so far fetched. Both disagree with certain statist policies. However, I think that AWS would bring the hammer down on wall street and redirect all of those financial resources to a state controlled welfare/entitlement/health care system. 
I think AWS are essentially hybrid anarchist/communists who use the veil of wall street disruption to further the growth of the state in other areas that are more politically useful to them. So essentially trading wall street bankers for a massive government overlord that makes a new orwellian religion of green living-equality-community-fairness. Government is the only entity that could enforce such a broad movement. In fact, AWS was very clear about not setting a firm set of objectives or actual goals. Their only real stated objective was advancing the fact that they are "entitled" fairness and dissatisfaction, and have no clue as to how to actually address the hopelessness that they feel. 
Bitcoin itself can help do all of those things, or none of those things. It simply doesn't care. That is why I love it... it is agnostic.

Except you're mistaken. With Bitcoin you are getting not only a seigniorage system, a payment network, a currency, a protocol for distributed contracts of all sorts, a medium for democracy (voting).. the list goes on and on and the real implications of the blockchain technology itself has yet to be even marginally utilized. You can't argue against something that you cannot fully conceptualize. 
So in that vein, I would say that in a value sense, Bitcoin provides an unfathomably higher return on the cost needed to establish, grow, and maintain its network backbone, than does Visa/MC etc.
@_date: 2014-03-06 00:19:54
I applaud you for voicing your concerns and making people think. We don't need a subset of mindless agreement around here. The debate and rehashing out of challenges to Bitcoin will only serve to strengthen the community and the concept, and its implementation. That said, like others, I disagree with many of your opinions. I think that when you are honest with yourself you  can clearly see that the die has been cast, and implementations are already in progress to address many of the issues you simply don't have patience to wait for. Thats fine, thats your prerogative. 2014 looks to be huge.
But I think that it is a bit unrealistic at this time to expect a mature ecosystem that works to its true potential so early in the game. Indeed, this game is just getting started, so buck up. I tend to avoid concerning myself too much with the point of sale aspects of Bitcoin and examine the protocol's true potential as a game changer in storing value, and as a basis for future applications such as smart property, smart contracts, distributed stock issuance/bonds, online betting, HUGE international remittance market (basically Western Union being wiped out unless they address this), commodity exchange, the list goes on and on.
 There are plenty of reasons to be excited about Bitcoin and stay in the arena. Oftentimes, I get so excited about the possibilities of this new medium that I cannot sleep at night. 
Keep the challenges and thoughts coming, stay positive, and thank you for your input! We will welcome you back any time.

You are wrong on this. There is absolutely nothing the government can do to access your or anyone else's coins if the private keys are properly secured.
A private key is not a password that can be hacked, nor is it something that you should  expose to a potentially compromised computer/phone or other third party unless you are willing to accept a certain amount of risk. 
For any substantial sum, cold storage should be used, until such time as more mature storage systems evolve, such as multi sig etc.

Bitcoin requires a bit of vision and patience. But money is naturally the first and most important application for the blockchain technology.

Realize that Bitcoin is still in its early adopter phase. Grandma and Grandpa applications and interfaces have yet to be truly implemented. Do your due diligence. You will find that the more you read, the more you want to know, particularly about how to secure your own money. That said, I generated offline keys using bit address.org and send my coin base BTC to around 5 separate addresses and then printed them out and also saved them to CDs and an encrypted USB drive. This process is known as "cold storage". You can find a lot of how to guides out there on this. The main risk to your BTC right now is actually you mishandling it, or leaving it on a private exchange. As we progress things will definitely smooth out (hardware wallets, better exchanges, etc.) But for now, just be diligent.

Would be interesting if the only way they allowed it to fluctuate was up, then market it as an "interest bearing checking account" or some such. Bitcoin price goes up, they split the proceeds between their business and the customer's balance perhaps. Price goes down, they account for it and insurance covers it. Seems very risky but potentially disruptive. Seems like they are betting a lot on widespread adoption and increases in price. I think they would be right, but who knows?

Facebook relies on a decentralized internet to propagate its social network, it should also follow that it would want to harness the power of a truly independent decentralized cryptocurrency to add trust and value to its content, and further solidify its social interactions using the unique power of money.
If Facebook failed or wavered, so would Facebook bucks. Facebook participants would be left holding a currency that was subject to Facebooks internal hierarchal systems. Bitcoin eschews such hierarchal systems and presents itself as a way to move out of, in between, and amongst social networks of all types.

So we're bootstrapping an entirely new currency/payment system that is outside of government control. But doing it this way is inefficient, imo. 
Bitcoin needs to validate itself organically, by having entrepreneurs develop use cases and killer apps (which is happening) that leverage Bitcoin's best qualitites; disintermediation, low cost, easy to use, no personal details necessary, cannot be counterfeited, does not require huge security to protect personal credit card information caches, etc. 
If and when this happens Amazon will come to Bitcoin, instead of the other way around. We shouldn't be groveling for acceptance if this system is working well in a free market. Amazon, as a member of the competitive free market, will naturally seek the best avenues for its business strategy. The way this is happening seems artificial and counter to the basic ideals many Bitcoin supporters (like me) espouse. 
I envision a discount being used to incentivize people to spend their Bitcoins. If you can wrap a closely knit business relationship between exchange, online retailer, and suppliers, then you can more readily pass along savings to the customer in the form of "coupons" for using Bitcoins, which saves them money, which, makes perfect economic sense. Can you imagine a tab on Amazon's site that says. "save 5% off your total buy using Bitcoin!"? 
Until we do that, people will always be asking the logical question, why use this currency, when I can simply use the world's reserve currency instead? Decentralization et al, does not resonate yet with the general populace. And anonymity does not do much for the Amazon shopper, because he already needs to enter his shipping info anyway. The only way to have people truly wake up to more involved notions like these is if we see a disastrous hyperinflation event, or the dollar losing its world reserve status. 
TLDR, ground up not top down.

Pheeva looks like a good start. I always thought the UI needed polishing. Too much spare room on the main wallet page. "Experimental" below the trader button. Trader button being oddly centered between the send and receive buttons. Its just lacks a harmonious flow that you get with well designed UIs. I think Venmo and Coinbases wallets are ok, but I like the mycelium dark theme. Something like a mycelium/coinbase hybrid design in a dark theme would be awesome actually. This is just horrid though:
The little keyboard icon beside the greyed out amount box is odd. Why not just allow the user to tap inside the amount box and bring up the numpad automatically? lets you get rid of that extra little ugly keyboard icon. Things like that. I like Mycelium a lot and use it. Just my random thoughts on what I would like to see. Also, I know it may sound odd, but I love the little coin jingle sound that the Schildbach Bitcoin app makes when you receive coins. Everyone I have showed that to giggles with delight when I send them coins and it makes that sound. It makes sending and receiving coins that much more fun. Besides, as with all these things, you can always allow the user to enable or disable them in the settings.

Mr. Krugman also believes burger flippers should be entitled to a 15$ minimum wage rate and that this will magically be absorbed by businesses. He also thinks that this will not cause layoffs due to increased automation.

For ordinary users who intend to invest and save a good portion of their holdings, this is a very good option. I experimented with a very small amount and the whole process was very easy to use and monitor; very easy to cancel an unauthorized withdrawal. 
Additionally, Coinbase sends you an SMS text and email as soon as the attempt is made to withdraw, as per your notification settings.

I bought on Coinbase. Sent to cold storage using a guide that I found [HERE](
Then secured that cold storage and use it for savings BTC. My hotwallet is Mycelium, which resides on my phone, where i need it and it has proven very secure. It even has a function to spend from your cold storage paper wallet should you elect to do so (although technically it is remotely possible that this could expose your private keys-but I'm not too worried about that). 
This way, I have a secure savings account, per se, and a spending account on my phone (otherwise known as a hot wallet) which I periodically top off using coinbase. Couldn't be easier, and I have yet to lose a fraction of a coin. I do not even use a web wallet, and will not until mutisig gets more mature. I just don't trust having a large amount of BTC on my computer at this time (just my personal stance). 
Also remember to always add two factor authentication to Coinbase and whichever web wallet you use.

It is an alternative to Bitcoin. It will likely be marketed as a populistic, less volatile alternative in the crypto space. The problem is not that it exists, the problem is that is being pitched by someone who should be devoting his time to something that is not currently enjoying stability, i.e., Bitcoin. This presents an existential dillemma for a board member and potential conflict of interest. Who is to say that Brock will not pitch for his company on the BF nickel? Who pays his travel bills and what is he talking about? What kind of behind the scenes global contacts is he making when he is supposed to be out "evangelizing" for an unstable alternative (Bitcoin) to his own token?
Satoshi would likely laugh at the idea of a dollar backed token emanating from a member of the very foundation established with the idea in mind to protect and educate on a new form of money that is in philosophical opposition to many of the notions of the US dollar. 
Why pitch for Bitcoin's stability and usefulness when Brock's alternative profits from the lack of it?

You're right. Thats a damn good point. They had the opportunity to create a Silicon Valley in NY by fostering a new age of digital payment startups there. Foster their growth and encourage innovation and jobs from the ground up. All using the vested financial infrastructure already in place to help get these enterprises bootstrapped faster. This is such a tragic fail for NY and we Americans in general.

"Consumer protections" is a euphemism for protection of the established banking elite. 
Is there such thing as a free market anymore, and if so, are consumers free to use due diligence to weed out and negate the least competitive actors in the marketplace? Or are we now living in a time when governments do all of these things for us?

I appreciate your optimism, but I really think that we truly need grandma- proof security (hardware wallets, hack resistant apps, etc.) before BTC can move to the more general user base. In its current form the ecosystem is maturing but just not quite ready for prime time. I say take a methodical approach with the notion always in mind that people are going to absolutely abuse the apps, the currency and the trading platforms with misuse (destroying coins, losing wallets, sending the wrong person their entire wallet balance, etc) and they need to be as robust and secure as possible, lest we reap a whirlwind of negative press and lose the battle before we even get it started.

Typical attack vector from the wellspring of innovation that is the payments industry. Now here we have the truly enlightened human being, David S. Evans. An "expert", who uses the (by now meme worthy) attack vector of distraction. 
It is an intellectually dishonest and vapid soul who tries to bring down a pure innovative thing based on the impurities of the systems that harness it. He makes not a single valid argument that can actually detract from the Bitcoin protocol and system itself, while resulting to Ad Hominem attacks against the early stage bunglers and fumblers of the companies that happen to use it or evangelize for it.

I am inclined to disregard this article. Why?
This is the only passage in the article that remotely connects this Nakamoto to Bitcoin, and it in itself is speculation derived from assumption of the interpretation and context of his statement. Everything that follows this passage from the article is nothing but pure, unadulterated conjecture.
"Nakamoto's responses to my questions about Bitcoin were careful but revealing.
Tacitly acknowledging his role in the Bitcoin project, he looks down, staring at the pavement and categorically refuses to answer questions.
"I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it," he says, dismissing all further queries with a swat of his left hand. "It's been turned over to other people. They are in charge of it now. I no longer have any connection."
Nakamoto refused to say any more, and the police made it clear our conversation was over."

TLDR, the big boys are ramping up their smear campaign to grease the onramps for the fall ETFs and Wall Street plays. Here is an opening salvo from marketwatch.
1. Bitcoin could be the tip of a dangerous iceberg
2. We’re a tax nightmare waiting to happen
3. Our hype is much bigger than our market share
4. Our volatility could leave you broke
5. We’re fertile ground for fraud
6. Our little software problems can cost you big bucks
7. You may have to print out your ‘digital’ money
8. Our fees are low, but maybe not for long
9. Currency ‘miners’ could mine your bank account
10. You might need us some day, like it or not
We will drive you broke and destroy your life, but hey.. you need us. Huh? 
This is a very sincere, honest and well intentioned statement that I had read when it was originally posted in the past, but it is still hard to stomach right now, as the mainstream media cherry-picks only the best nuggets:


Edit: Even better, the headline link on the marketwatch homepage actually says, "What bitcoin won’t say: I may leave you broke ".

Bitcoin is akin to digital cash and it is in its infancy. And yet, you insist on directly comparing it to the entire credit card industry. Actually, to me that says a lot based off of the direct comparison. To even mention it as a competitor to Visa or Mastercard says a lot about its potential for the future. 
Will there be Bitcoin credit cards? Most likely. Will security vastly, vastly improve? Absolutely. Will there be types of insurance for the sheeple to misuse and abuse the system and still avoid financial natural selection? Of course. Be patient and let the market driven ecosystem blossom. The future will blow your mind.

One of the main reasons to spend it now is to obviate to the general public its usefulness and inspire innovative products around it. This facilitates velocity and transaction volume, with the objective of obtaining some sort of global "escape velocity" after which the sheeple can adopt it, and you, the hodler, can hodl the hell out of it, because it won't matter at that point. It will be useful to the public, and it can be denominated to 8 digits. And it will be worth whatever supply and demand dictates on a global scale.. which will be an astronomical number. Who is to say that, arbitrarily, a cryptocurrency that is experiencing global adoption can not be worth, let's say, .00001 units to 1 dollar?

Youre confusing Bitcoin the currency and the Blockchain ledger. Although Bitcoins as currency reside on the distributed ledger, they are not directly comparable to credit cards. Credit Cards take a month or more to actually settle, and a Bitcoin transacts near instantly, and settles provably in 10 minutes, often much less. 
But the Blockchain is more analogous to credit card payment networks, and it allows for disintermediation, which can aid entrepreneurs in devising new innovative systems to cut out the middleman as we know him today "JPMorgan Chase/Visa/Paypal et al). This way, these entrepreneurs can cut costs and permit these savings to be passed along to the customer in the form of product discounts when paying with Bitcoin a la Gyft and others, while still providing basic financial services unlike anything we currently know. Think of it as services for your digital cash. Now you can choose to buy these services or not, it is entirely up to you. a Bitcoin will transact either way, and the beautiful thing is that it empowers you to decide which way you want to go with your money, instead of being locked down to a select few global payment networks that reside entirely within the control of central banks and rely on onerous and unfair fee systems to stay afloat.

People make the mistake of comparing Bitcoin to Myspace or Napster, when in actuality, it is far more powerful in its incentive structure and human motive: exchange of money/value not to mention the underlying technology of the Blockchain.

They were incubated in the digital era, in a world of Facebook, pokemon, and Twitter. They speak this language. Bitcoin gives them voice. And there are more than subtle ideological and political implications regarding the sovereignty of money that Andreas mentions in the conclusion. We are beginning to live in a world where people value their internet connectivity and access far more than they do their connection to a bunch of [disconnected statists]( in Washington.

A far more honorable way to go about this would be to simply articulate to the owner how acceptance of Bitcoin could save him on credit card processing fees, streamline tipping, and mitigate risk from having you carry around wads of cash in your 1983 Honda Civic (with extra large chromed exhaust tips).

The problem with "theoretical" technical problems like this is that they scare out investors and the general public.  If it became generally known that a centralized entity has an inordinate amount of trust in a supposed trustless system it would crush consumer sentiment, and entice regulators, thus attracting more government intervention. 
Bitcoin evangelists such as Andreas Antonopolous insist that a 51% attack is economically and logically unsound. That is not the problem. The problem is mining centralization opens up the market to manipulation, and confidence in the protocol decreases as centralization increases. This has a ripple effect placing downward pressure on innovation and investment, particularly as it becomes more broadly understood that a particular entity can orphan blocks and withhold transactions. The problem is a cascading decrease in confidence that is exploitable; whether it is in the proposition for a replacement coin or just the spread of misinformation by a competitor to Bitcoin, i.e., large banking payment systems. Further, game theory suggests that it might be wise for a rational actor to attempt an irrational attack against Bitcoin through a channel such as this. In essence, destroying some of his own assets in order to discredit Bitcoin as a future payment system. True, it would not seem to make sense to do this, but a savvy opponent could discredit this protocol and conveniently present what would appear to be a viable alternative concurrently. 
What most people do not realize is that as competition in the mining industry increases, centralization will be drastically increased as we shift from decreasing advances in ASICs to relocation of mining to areas of the cheapest electricity, as pointed out aptly by Tim Swanson [here]( Massive data centers in areas of colder climates and cheap electricity will make this problem grow beyond our control. 
I applaud the effort to open dialogue and seek feedback from the other constituencies in the bitcoin ecosystem. This problem needs to be addressed for bitcoin to succeed in the long term. 
I think we want to codify a system that is inherent to the protocol that permanently addresses this fundamental issue of mining centralization. 
We cannot trust you, your words in that regard mean nothing. We cannot trust anyone, that is the whole point. In order for this to happen the problem needs to be removed from human hands. The only thing we have truly learned throughout this ordeal, is that we can place trust in no one.

If people can invent it, New York can regulate it. Tell me, Mr Lawsky, what have you invented in your life besides a series of onerous and inefficient regulations that you tell yourself are there "to help and protect people".
Thing is, in NY, the free market is no longer able to decide what is best for it; the government must step in and do that for you. Ranging from an overly large cola to an overly large bitcoin transaction. NY will not allow us to have another Gox, because they have decreed it. They have decided for the people, so that tranquilized public need not do due diligence anymore.
I suppose you could say the same thing about the FED and it's encouragement of divergence from rational and natural free-market driven principles anymore, but I digress. 
NY isn't about protecting the startup and facilitating the small guy innovators. This is all about exclusion and building a base for "crypto Goldman Sachs" and giants in the industry in the name of "consumer protection". There is no encouragement of innovation here. 
I encourage this proposal in its entirety, and in fact, I highly suggest you scour it for any other areas that might need additional scrutiny. This will hasten the demise of over reaching regulation and push innovation to areas where there is the least resistance (as it should be). 
You assume that the US dollar and New York are the paradigm of the future, but you are mistaken. This is a global peer to peer currency, and like water, it will flow where there is a crack, no matter how tightly you clench your fingers.

You're wrong.
You are incorrectly assuming that use cases, incentives, and motives for people to even want to hold Bitcoin in the first place will just simply materialize; we're not there yet. We have to have adoption first. 
Right now it is volatile, obscure, technical, etc. This according to the average layman/woman. Don't believe me? Just go out and conduct your own little sample survey in the real world and become enlightened. 
Now, in order to get someone to *really* want something, you have to have incentive, use cases and thus demand for it. We're trying to generate that demand by tipping, using, spreading, innovating. Once you have some semblance of mainstream adoption, *then* you can hodl all you want, and you will see the typical *human* negative psychology at play. The more scarce it is, the more they may want it. 
Not withstanding the possibility that Bitcoin could be seen as an economic Veblen good. 
If you're hodling something that no one wants, cares about or knows how to properly use, what is its value? Does the fact that you are generating scarcity increase demand? Nope.

Wolf in sheep's clothing most likely. 
I don't see New York as innovating or encouraging the fringe on anything anywhere. Go to California or Austin for that. On the contrary, people are leaving the state in droves as the result of overtaxation and over regulation. You can't even buy a 32oz soft drink in NYC, and you expect these same kinds of people to help push a new frontier in digital currency? I think they just want their control linkages firmly established before this gets out of their control. 
Edit: Oh and another thing, regulators (because I know you read this), bear in mind that you can stifle innovation here, but at the end of the day with truly decentralized worldwide monetary networks the rest of the world can just say, "go fuck yourself, New York", and move on without you. You no longer control people's money, or where they go or what they do with it. I can take my fungible BTC and move to Cyprus and there isn't a goddamn thing you can do about it except lose tremendous tax revenues the more you over regulate.
Now to be fair, I know Lawsky has promised fair and sensible regulation, but when the government starts making statements like, "we're here to help", or, "we've come to establish the guardrails for sensible growth", I start to get very fearful. Once you learn to translate backwards government-speak, you begin to understand what these people really mean. It's all about empty promises and power. Yet another reason why it was so fun and informative to watch Netflix's House of Cards. I seriously think half the regulators and bureaucrats in power secretly aspire to those kinds of misadventures.

Woosh, this whole Bitcoin thing is confusing for you, isn't it! The idea is to go outside the bounds of traditional government fiat currency and legacy banking systems. What is the incentive to do so, you ask? Well, I don't know if you've been keeping up with current events, pal, but the JPY is getting it's ass kicked. Deflation and hyperinflation is possible and in many other countries as well, and many see a very real threat to holding fiat. 
Suppose you were to use a website like the one proposed an use it to find a good or service in your area. In that case, you could transact with the buyer directly, anonymously, even digitally thereby disintermediating entire industries erected to suck the wealth out of your pocket for the mere chance to spend your value as they see fit, on their hours. 
What your post illustrates to me, is precisely how few individuals truly realize what value transfer is, and how much freedom of choice is being absolved from them. 
Bitcoin is trying to do better than this. Don't think of it in terms of an existing legacy system. Think of it as a new paradigm to entirely replace (and make obsolete) many of the broke ass systems that we are so used to being crippled by. This requires the same amount of vision and intellectual probing needed by any other member of society when a new innovation presents itself (horseless carriage, telephone, email, driverless cars).

Whenever I show my wallet to someone who is not tech savvy or sitting in their mom's basement in their pajamas reading Reddit all day, I lose them when I have to explain how Bitcoin are denominated into 8 decimals. I mean, seriously their eyes glass over and they are gone. If I could show them a few thousand, or a simple large positive number, psychologically they are primed to understand that more readily. That is what the largely computer savvy, white, 20-30 something crowd here might not get. Mainstream adoption is about conforming to a metric that the layman and woman can embrace. And based off of my personal observations, 8 decimals is not it. As a bonus, you will likely see price increases as people jump in to the Bitcoin space now that they know that they do not have to buy an "entire" Bitcoin. They can play around with a little, get hooked, and join the party for real with a greater amount later. This also helps promote learning the way that it is meant to be.. start small and easy, and work into it with practice. I am in favor of this idea.

A couple reasons (of many possible):
1.) Network effect: It's been hard enough creating mainstream adoption for a system as massive as Bitcoin, let alone some obscure startup coin that probably doesn't actually differ all that much more in the eyes of your average layman (who doesn't  understand Bitcoin to begin with). 
2.) Any attempt to replace Bitcoin using similar systems (like the Blockchain) simply help to validate the very premise Bitcoin already made good on. Eg:, Fedcoin, JPMorgancoin, Currentc, GoldmanCoin, whatever, et al... Goto 1.

Incentive. What incentive do mainstream adopters have to jump through hoops? Especially if the price falls rapidly.

Essentially paying it forward to the customer to get them on board. 
Additionally, the on and off ramps need to get much more user friendly and secure. It needs to be fall over easy to securely buy and redeem your Bitcoin right now.

Journalist proposes that the governments of the world will, out of necessity, cooperatively ban Bitcoin as a result of it's anonymity and capacity to permit people to escape the current legacy banking system. 
Well, you may as well ban email, too. And encryption altogether. And the internet. And math. Just ban it all. Sure, why not just
BAN FREEDOM. 
It *could* work. In theory. You see, freedom allows us to escape the clutches of totalitarianism. And the desire to do so, according to author, makes us Bitcoin advocates libertarian freakazoids. 
Such is the state of the cowed main stream media and public in the world today. Indeed, what would we ever do without the government's ability to protect us all and redistribute everything that we have fought for and earned through narrow, un-innovative, supervised financial channels.

Right, and additionally, your value-add could be hand walking them, "concierge style" through the process of drafting the will language, setting up attorneys, establishing safe deposit boxes, or whatever other related services that your customers might desire that would make the entire process as seamless as possible. Seems like a niche idea at the moment, with relatively few bitcoin holders and even fewer bitcoins involved in estates, but if things take off, you could find yourself cornering the business. I know orange county is probably as good a place as any for such an endeavour.

When someone devises a payments platform that renders existing payment systems obsolete/bypasses them, of course someone will want to hire "experts" to lend credence to the most negative aspects. Except, as you point out, this isn't a negative aspect. The Bitcoin system is agnostic. Because it happens to be used (less so than cash) by criminals happens to make it a convenient attack vector for the truly ignorant.

Shock and awe indeed. Initially, my impression was that the idea was to put forth these regs as part of an "offer:counter offer" scheme, whereby the illusion of regulatory participation is presented to the unwashed masses here in Reddit". Any "offer" that is made must at first be the most brash or outlandish, so that each offer:counter offer appears psychologically to placate the other party. So no matter what NYFDS does now, it "appears" that they are being reasonable and giving way, and that any deeply held opposition to their "offers" is highly partisan. 
I'm worried about this. Partially because I reject the regulations in their current form to begin with, so in that regard, we can't even sit down at the same table. That's part of the problem. When I negotiate a new car purchase, I reserve (and often use) the right to walk out of the showroom. Inevitably, the dealer contacts me back and we reach an agreement. 
I am concerned that this is going to be a veiled one-way conversation. We talk, you listen. Sure, I am familiar with the way FAA CFRs work. NPRMs, these things are put out for public comment, and from time to time the FAA listens. But in this arena, they have no real incentive to listen to the community other than to appear to placate them. The entrenched businesses in New York possess such overwhelming firepower, that we are essentially locked in the showroom with a proverbial gun to our heads. I don't define this as "participation" or "negotiation". 
I don't see Lawsky truly engaging the community. An AMA is trite. To me at least. A real step forward would be to see Lawsky take a break from his CNBC inerviews and instead allow himself to be filmed in a YouTube meeting engaging with Bitcoin glitterati. I would like to see his points debated with the likes of Gavin Andresen, Vitalik Buterin, Susan Athey, Andreas Antonopolous (as if that would happen), Marc Andresen, the list goes on and on. Forgive me if I left your name out of the above list. There are so many bright minds in this space that I would be hard pressed to find people unavailable to engage him in a roundtable. 
I personally don't think that regulators need to show their hand completely, because that would tip off criminals as to the methodology behind their laws. But if Ben can get on an AMA, and make some noise on CNBC, then surely he can directly engage the community with answers to some of their questions. Unfortunately, the truth is that even the masters of this new digital medium themselves don't even know all the appropriate questions to ask, or points to be made. 
Lawsky is effectively killing things *that haven't even been made yet*. That is *not* effective regulatory oversight.

This is what I did to put my considerable cache of BTC into cold storage:
Followed the EXCELLENT offline cold storage [guide]( here.
The only tricky part was getting Linux to boot to USB successfully (windows PC). I had to spend quite a bit of time with this as my BIOS didn't want to cooperate (perhaps its old..newer BIOSs shouldn't have this problem). Installed the latest Linux Ubuntu to a bootable USB drive using this easy self installing [program]( that I found after much trial and error. This program worked seamlessly and created a plug and play bootable Linux installation on an old SanDisk 8GB stick that I had laying around.
Then backed up the private and public keys to an [encrypted USB stick]( [paper printouts]( and CDs. 
Most went to a safety deposit box. A CD went to a secure location in case of bank fire, disaster, etc. 
I created about 8 private keys to deposit to using this method in the youtube video. That way my BTC is distributed evenly throughout a number of keys in case one gets compromised. I use Mycelium's "cold storage" function to draw from the public keys because it easily lets you scan the QR code from your paper wallet and then erases all traces of it from memory once you exit the app.

I know that there has been an ongoing feud (for all practical porpoises) between NY and TX regarding the poaching of businesses to Texas. As Austin is the tech innovation and actual geographic capital of Texas, I would say that any attempt to execute such a maneuver should likely include approaching the favorable environment of that state. 
Here is one problem that I have with your proposal, though. At the moment, none of us currently know what the proper amount/scope/technical depth of regulations in this space should be. We simply DO NOT KNOW the extent to which Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can impact the world. As such, we should adopt a permissive and voluntary approach to regulation and encourage only the bare minimum to encourage growth and innovation, until we can more readily observe the appropriate regulator response. 
Regulators run the risk of imposing onerous burdens on a nascent industry that is not fully understood. NY is moving quickly because financial citadels in that state likely grasp (on a fundamental level at least) the potential threat that small startups can pose to disrupt the payments industry there. 
This is not acceptable to those citadels. They will (and are) doing everything in their power to prevent the upending of their base of power. This is being done under the auspices of money laundering and financial crime prevention. I think regulators will have to recognize that money laundering will have to be prevented in other ways, as the advent of cryptocurrency restricts their abilities in some ways.

Bitcoin is a push payment system. You push only the amount you intended to send, and nothing more.

Ah excuse me but I am fairly furious reading this totally cavalier response. This "beta" project has been 5 years running and its longtime steward says this?? So appear all over the media/tv and at MIT to tell these kids that, "hey guys, we have this great time sink that you can potentially waste all your time and money on"?
What kind of message is this sending? It leaves the reader with  almost a sense of abandonment from one of the most important figures in its history. 
The fact that ANY new payment system can potentially fail is obvious to everyone but you don't come out and say that amidst a serious problem like this. Could you imagine any company or service that has an entire system being built around it saying such a thing? An ecosystem that is already paying people's wages and feeding their families?
Will Gavin come out and declare when bitcoin is not still in beta? Because I would love to know so that I can resume investing over six figures into a system that I can "potentially waste all my money on". 
He could at least say something that spurs innovation and a call together of the community to solve the problem once and for all. Or do you believe that he thinks p2pool is the solution that we need long term? The problem is that with each passing day it gets harder and harder to make big changes as the bitcoin economy grows.

I accidentally wiped my phone and lost my google 2fa app. Was unable to recover it and was thusly locked out of my Coinbase account. Went around the ring with Coinbase support for a while and got it reset, but had to jump through hoops. However, I was (and still am) locked out of the google 2fa on coinbase on my own account. As a result, I elected to use Authy for my new 2FA because it has backups that you can restore if this situation happens again. With google, I simply couldn't find a way to restore the backup keys to migrate them to the new phone. If anyone knows of such a way, I would appreciate learning.

Ok, I get the idea of a frictionless buying experience, but this kind of thing seems to be only useful in hipster boutique stores, where you can track inventory exiting the store with an electronic gate at the door to prevent people walking out with product. 
Now how exactly are you going to do that at, say, Walmart? NFC/beacon tags on every single item in-store to prevent theft?
I think customers may be ready for a friction-less buying experience (no cashier), but the real question is: are the merchants?
@_date: 2014-12-13 13:04:33
Merchants (like NEWEGG) are sitting around with their collective thumbs up their asses using Bitcoin as a gimmicky marketing tool. 
What they need to do is start the real work of using Bitcoin for what it is good for... securely streamlining the transaction mechanisms and passing these savings along to the customer. Even if Newegg offered a 3% discount, this would hugely incentivize people to use Bitcoin as a "coupon" of sorts" and help them overlook volatility in the near term. Granted, this volatility is decreasing yearly, but still, it is too much for the average customer. 
I agree with spkrdt below who states that merchant adoption is part of incentive. True, this provides readily available outlets to spend, but it doesn't answer the question that many will ask you when you pitch Bitcoin to them, specifically, "So why should I really convert my dollars to Bitcoin?"
Newegg accepts them!.... nope. 
Freedom from the Fed!...nope.
Pseudoanonymity!...pseudo what?...nope.
Easy to secure, kinda!...nope.
You see where I am going with this. I have had this conversation in the real world, not the fantasy reddit world many times, and people do not want to part with their dollars readily for the above reasons that I often give. We need something more. We need real world incentive, simplicity, properly polished UIs, security, and availability. 
I try to tell people that all of these things are coming, but again, it isn't enough to get them to actually convert dollars to Bitcoin. The only folks I've had success with fall into two categories: Conservatives/Libertarians who hate the Fed/Big government and recognize the threat posed to our way of life by the current iteration of centrally planned Keynesianism, and people who intellectually resonate with the idea of scarcity (21 million of a scarce, digital commodity). Some folks recognize the enormous potential of Bitcoin 2.0 ideas and innovations but these concepts are far more esoteric and lie almost exclusively within the realm of fantasy at the moment (for the average Joe). 
Merchants, big name merchants, need to shit or get off the pot with passing along these so called, "savings" that Bitcoin adopters claim to provide. We need more than gimmicks, its time for sales and numbers.

You haven't read the proposed Bitlicense. If you had, you'd realize that it requires payment processors like Bitpay and Coinbase to maintain strict (and in some cases ever stricter) regulatory measures than legacy banks. 
Further, it exempts said legacy banks from these very requirements. I don't know if you know this, but Coinbase and Circle have said that they would be forced to essentially pull out of NY as a result of it being impossible to do business there as a result of this proposal. 
But I'm glad that we have statists like you, promoting onerous regulation on disruptive innovators, while you protect the citadel around the upper 1% banking elite in JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and elsewhere.

Enable two factor authentication on any and all sites/wallets that have it. Closely guard your physical private keys and thoroughly research cold storage for those coins that you want to save for an extended period/hold. [Here]( is a decent guide. 
Do not store large amounts on exchanges, that is to say, you do not truly own the coins unless you possess your own key pairs for them. There is always the remote possibility that the exchange can have a problem that may leave you in a bind (a la Gox). 
Secure your phone, if that is to be your hot wallet. Ensure you have a way to back up all wallets, and practice with a small amount of coin in said wallet. Back it up, practice recovering backup, etc. etc.

Bitcoin has intrinsic value, per your definition because it is in use by an ever increasing base of people. It is becoming perceived as a useful store of value in this regard. 


Bitcoin and the block chain invention is to be one of the most revolutionary, groundbreaking financial systems ever devised. Thus it is to be a paragon of trading tools. The payments protocol has far more uses than a simple currency, and we have not yet fully thought out the full potential. 
Thus, I might say that Bitcoin has both intrinsic and extrinsic value. Intrinsic in its use and perception as a valuable currency and unit of account. Extrinsic in its fundamental use as a payments tool or mechanism by which other stores of value might be exchanged irrespective of peoples perception of the currency itself. 
@_date: 2014-06-07 22:27:56
If this is indeed the threat that many people say that it is, then why aren't all of these companies, who have their entire financial future (to include payment processors/exchanges/wallet companies/brokers/etc) all contributing to help find a solution? I mean, if it can ruin Bitcoin, then it ruins not just ghash, but the entire ecosystem. Therefore not just the core devs, but everyone, has an interest in resolving it once and for all. And it isn't just the fact that Ghash can execute a 51% attack - It is the lingering threat, the mere possibility that inhibits investment, promotes bad publicity, and squelches innovation. Serious investors and the broader public are going to really laugh at a system that is relying on the whims of a few centralized miners to control the future of this technology.

Bitcoin should facilitate open governments through decentralization of value transfer systems. Later, this technology may drive decentralization in other facets of society, such as legal systems and corporations. We should facilitate smart, innovative regulation and understanding of this technology. You won't win many battles this way. Winning is a subjective concept and this is not a zero sum game. We can fight the regulation makers, but it is ultimately better to convince them that this represents a better way- one that allows us all to prosper.

It should be noted that Coinbase and Bitpay both allow you to select how much of the proceeds of sales are remitted to you in fiat dollars or Bitcoin itself. So, if you want some bitcoin exposure, you can, say, have 70% sent to your bank account in dollars, and the remaining 30% sent to your Bitcoin wallet. 
I recommend using Bitcoin as a payment mechanism to incentivize tech savvy customers to use your product or service by offering them a discount for using Bitcoin. You may look at this as a "coupon" of sorts. Because you pay no credit card fees for accepting Bitcoin, and there is no backend security to be maintained, or liability of holding credit card numbers and personal information, you may find it profitable to pass any savings that result from these efficiencies along to the customer in the form of discounts.

Many retailers cite the fact that there are no (or fewer) chargebacks, fraud, or security measures to take in order to implement and use Bitcoin. It is rapidly becoming plug and play to implement, whether it be an online shop, or a larger retailer...as most of those critical components are intrinsic to Bitcoin already.
Many retailers also forgo the ability to conduct microtransactions with credit cards, because of minimum fees. Bitcoin changes that, too. Not all microtransactions do not have to be on-chain. These small purchases are perfect for off-chain, instant processing by innovative companies such as Bitpay. Have you ever tried to purchase something small and been denied because "it needs to cost &gt; 2.00$"? Retailers can pass this value add along to consumers who use Bitcoin in the form of discounts. 
As far as fees and bid/ask spread are concerned, these are driven by the exchange arrangement that you may have. Currently, some Bitcoin sellers, like Circle, offer zero fees. And that 1-3% reward benefit that you get is highly dependent on where you shop, what you buy, and how much you pay for a yearly membership. Not to mention the cost of incurring interest charges. 
For instance, I pay 75$ yearly for a Marriott Rewards Signature Visa, and that reduces the value of the rewards benefits that I receive. Not to mention Marriott is constantly upping the point values necessary to redeem for rooms, so therein lies some "inflation" of your "rewards" as well. 
Overall, though, I agree that Bitcoin's current use case in retail is not being exploited to its fullest extent, and I think that you will see further streamlining and incentive to use it so in the future as the ecosystem matures.

Considering the mass amount of capital expended by credit card companies to prevent fraud, and the relative rarity of it happening at the register for low cost items, I'd say a merchant saving on those CC fees by adopting Bitcoin has little to risk with zero conf on, say, items less than 100$ worth.

I agree. I think a few of us are just a little tired of having somewhat paniccy sounding posts every time we see a little spike in days destroyed or an "early-ish" address shift coins. We all know that is is just guesswork. Early adopters would be foolish not to shift coins into more secure environments, whether it be BIP38 encrypted wallets, multisig solutions, or trezor hard wallets or anything else. The space has matured, and we need not be enormously alarmed that early adopters are reacting to new innovations.

So let me get this straight, bitcoin mining as an industry would be just as robust today if the entire ecosystem knows that in 4 months the price could be nil? Are you insane? I understand their short term motives to generate ROI, but they have to constantly update their hardware, which necessitates spending inflating fiat or BTC for a slew of new machines which take months to arrive through the order pipeline. In that time, if, like you say, the price tanks, they are left with a warehouse full of newly ordered, useless machines, and NO ROI because the price is zero. The longer bitcoin is around, the longer they can engage in their psuedo-short term ROI rent seeking activities. It is a cycle of vicious short term competitiveness, yes. But they should want it to be in perpetuity. Hence, miners have a very strong incentive to engage with, participate in, and cooperate with the community to further the actual medium to long term viability of the network they are securing. My argument is Ghash's activities slow this cycle down, by depressing the price and reducing confidence in the system overall. 
And don't try to tell me that all existing ASIC users will be in posession of useless machines anyway. This is simply not true and I do not buy that argument. Quickly, we are seeing ASIC efficiency reaching a limit, so we will soon have many older machines that can still be put to use by those users with the most important edge: lower electricity costs. Many miners will some day sell their used machines to those other miners with lower energy costs. 
It is like saying that miners are playing a zero sum game. I say they aren't, or shouldn't be, because if they operate with a mind to the long term as well as the short term, everyone wins. The price goes up, they spend less in fiat or BTC today for newer, better mining rigs tomorrow, and the network becomes that much more secure, and the cycle continues.
A 10,000$ bitcoin would be great for miners. Even though every person on earth would be looking for a way to get into mining, those miners that have immediate competitive edges due to lower electricity costs or existing infrastructure and orders already in place will reap disproportionate rewards. It takes between 3-9 months to design an ASIC from scratch and tape-out (3 months assumes double 
shifts). So not everyone can just hop on the gravy train immediately.

Why would they mine something that is subject to someone else's control at first? I mean, if Bitcoin essentially becomes Ghashcoin, because, (as stated above it pays miners for establishing efficient monopolies economically in the short term), then why wouldnt these companies just form their own coins, or collude to form a very dominant coin that they alone control? In that case, Bitcoin would truly be dead. 
If Bitcoin's power is in its decentralized nature, and it's agnosticism, then that power needs to be codified by an intelligent change to the protocol to reflect thus. We seriously have a system here that rewards centralization and monopoly (in its current form). I mean what the fuck is the purpose of that?

If you believe that your bitcoins will increase in value at some point in the future, then this is actually a great way to lock in effective discounts immediately. 
So ideally, a Bitcoin user would demand a discount from the merchant enjoying savings there (up to 6% with some gift card companies), then rebuying, locking in a new coin which likely will climb in value at some point, assuming the buyer is patient enough. Savvy users could this way enjoy untold savings. 
Would be nice to have an app that tracked cost basis for each of the coins purchased, so that the user could more effectively divvy up his savings according to the gains realized.
Now you have an instant payment system that incentivizes consumers to spend at stores that offer discounts, which spreads adoption, increases demand for goods, promotes the new digital economy, and reduces reliance on fraud prone credit card transaction schemes.

Blockchain technology enables what amounts to a secure "vote" with a monetary unit. If there is no use for voting with a system very similar to or exactly like the one we are using, then there is probably no use for Bitcoin. A vote is nothing more than an exchange of trust.

Good idea, to add to that, at the end: Find a way to attach a custom colored coin called "Deed for a House in Beverly Hills" to a paper wallet under their seat. Have that one random person send the house to your wallet QR and show in the colored coin wallet that it has been received instantly. Or some such.
I don't think any dazzling Bitcoin presentation is truly complete without a little blaze of glory the likes of which Bitcoin 2.0 systems can achieve. They need to know that currency is only the tip of the iceberg, but dont tell them too much about it.. leave them hanging in awe after the house transfer and make them seek further on their own.

It won't kill bitcoin. But... The marketing campaign will likely be based on the notion that, "like bitcoin but better... without all the volatility".
Does anyone seriously think they will be complementary? The idea of the fed inflated dollar in many respects contravenes the basic premises of why satoshi created bitcoin in the first place. It's like a sick joke.

Many people would rather not lock their phone, given the constant retyping of the password with repeated locking/unlocking. 
Its far easier to have individual security related apps like this at least provide a simple setting to enable PIN protection, for the user that prefers this. I could care less if someone reads my email if I leave my phone unattended and it falls into someone elses hands before I can remotely lock it. But it is far more damaging if My 2FA accounts are labelled (as they are in gauth) and viewable for an attacker who can now access many other secure sites and clean them out, or lock me out entirely.

You would have the chance to use your Bitcoin at a savings.

[New Bitcoin Movie Introduces You To The Many White Dudes Working On Bitcoin](
by Kashmir Hill.
Seriously? Is this the Onion?
What kind of vapid, intellectually hypocritical bullshit is this? It is precisely this kind of drivel that is pushing people away from "journalism" these days. As if bitcoin has some sort of moral imperative to inherently bring in any particular social or gender group. It's like Kashmir saying a garbage collector's union has an ethical imperative to hire more of a particular ethnic group because there aren't enough of that race/gender collecting garbage. Would she ever say that? No. 
And what happens when you substitute another racial or ethnic group for whites (in the linked article's title)? Now you're instantly a racist or sexist, and you owe the obligatory "apology" on Twitter.
 
Kashmir Hill is a race and gender baiting idiot, who gets away with this kind of stuff because she happens to be female herself, which she apparently believes puts her in an advantageous (from the current socio-political zeitgeist perspective) position to unfairly critique the presence of white males in a particular tech space (who are, as of late, an easy target politically). As if the mere presence of too many "white males" is, in itself, a bad sign and a harbinger of racism. That, my friends, is a very slippery and scary slope. One step away from thought crime.

I recently cracked open a long held BIP38 wallet to convert some BTC into XCP on one of the exchanges. I'll admit that I was slightly uneasy about actually decrypting this cold storage address, but I used the cold storage function of Mycelium to access the address and enter the BIP38 password. Went off without a hitch quickly and seamlessly.
At some point you just have to trust the technology that this is based on. I did, and it worked great. It was a non unsubstantial sum of money, too. 
Never hurts to check a passphrase on a dummy key when you generate offline, like I did. After that test, I made the live addresses that I used for long term cold storage, and encrypted them.

I generally agree with the article and here is why:
1.) This is a centralized competitor to Bitcoin. Its marketing drive will be geared towards pointing out an alternative to Bitcoin that is less volatile. This can be destructive to Bitcoin because the volatility is inherent in a nascent and illiquid money, and yet it has been decreasing historically. Such a drive will focus on aspects that weaken Bitcoin's appeal psychologically and direct attention to places other than those most advantageous to achieving the stated mission goals of the Bitcoin Foundation. 
2.) This represents a tremendous conflict of interest. Pierce now has a financial incentive to drive people away from the "volatile" alternative (Bitcoin). Ironically, he must pretend to shuffle around the world evangelizing Bitcoin, but in actuality, he will likely be using Bitcoin Foundation funds to plant himself in various global centers of cryptocurrency interest and then subvert Bitcoin, while pitching his own coin on the down low. 
3.) Realcoin is tied to a premise of an unsound, inflationary (possibly soon to be hyperinflationary) fiat currency, the US dollar. Satoshi deliberately responded to the US FED and the 2008 financial collapse with an idea that circumvents the centrally planned economic principles behind [temporal reserve currencies](
4.) Realcoin's very name subconsciously suggests that it is tied to something, "real", i.e., the US Dollar. But in actuality, the US dollar is tied to nothing more than ever increasing loads of debt and leverage. This very name, while including the suffix, "coin" suggests that it is an alternative, an option to Bitcoin, which many ignorant observers have accused as, "intangible", or "valueless". This subtle dig at Bitcoin has not gone unnoticed. 
5.) If Bitcoin fails, the Mastercoin and Realcoin coexistence can continue without much disruption. They rely on the blockchain, and as a result, we have a boardmember of the very foundation established to preserve and protect Bitcoin establishing a protective hedge and invested in a populistic and subversive alternative. 
6.) While it is possible that this idea may gain some popularity amongst some newcomers, it is positioned to introduce further instability and CONFLICT OF INTEREST/DISRUPTION within the Bitcoin Foundation itself. This disruption comes at a time when solidarity is needed and a focus on addressing regulation and education. 
My personal impression of Brock Pierce is that he is an opportunist who is willing to stop at nothing to gain notoriety, and to leverage his unique position in the cryptocurrency space to further his own company's goals. His recent election to the Bitcoin Foundation and his current dealings should further enhance disruption and incoherence within the foundation. 
I'm sure other people could come up with a lot of other reasons why this is a bad idea coming from someone at the top of the foundation. Go do it on your own, fine. Just don't pretend to represent us.

Start with something that grabs their attention immediately. It must be relevant and pertinent to their interests and motivations. What do you think that would likely be for this audience. Consider this. Grab their attention and then hold them with riveting aspects of the technology that they can understand. DO NOT do [this](
Some examples I might use:
-Bitcoin is the internet of money, and currency is just the first app. (this is from Andreas Antonopolous..may want to watch some of his presentations).
-Bitcoin is not just a currency, it is a decentralized (no one owns it) network that allows us to establish financial trust almost instantly, anywhere in the world.
-Bitcoin applications can be used for much more than currency. Did you know that they can be used to: Vote, establish distributed financial exchanges, notarize documents, establish smart property and smart contracts, distributed stock issuance, share files securely similar to dropbox, the list goes on and on. 
-Bitcoin frees up billions of unbanked populace to effectively "be their own bank" without the need for a centralized third party.
-Bitcoin applications can allow you to transfer ownership of commodities securely and near instantly. 
-Bitcoin is secured by one of the most powerful cryptographic methods ever devised. 
-Bitcoin is decentralized so you cannot turn it off or shut it down.
-Bitcoin is a young, emerging invention who's ecosystem is rapidly growing but is not yet anywhere near its potential. 
-Bitcoin, or a system like it, is the future of finance. Get onboard or be left behind. 
I think this is a decent starting point, but you get my drift here. Go watch some andreas antonopolous and you will get hyped to deliver this important speech.

This seems significant. They are providing a means to add virtual currencies, including Bitcoin, into a currency selector mechanism whereby the amount is deducted at checkout based on a certain exchange rate. Also it mentions social site currencies:
"2.4 Scenario Social Markets
Within social markets things are exchanged using a completely virtual currency, which has no
relation to any real currency. It is used as an arbitrary measurement of something meaningful
only to that social community. This usage scenario implies the following requirements:
● It must be possible to model virtual currencies that are able to completely replace any

I've about had it with this idiotic line of reasoning. It is amusing how many people on this so-called technical subreddit have no idea about the vision and true uses for Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin possesses within it tremendous intrinsic value to me and eventually to you (although you may not know it yet), the notion of which your antiquated sensibilities simply cannot grasp. You are muddying the waters with age old notions of value that are derived from physical manifestations such as simple use in manufacturing, like gold, or combustion and production into plastics and fuel or other things, as in oil. 
But what Bitcoin presents to the world is an entirely new invention or digital commodity that humanity has never seen before. And that invention is decentralized, digital trust. Trust has value, intrinsic value, because it is a method of human communication that is somewhat scarce. You have to go to a "Trust" or bank, to withdraw and hold your funds, you have to put your "trust" in a company that invests your mutual funds an so on. With the Bitcoin protocol, we establish intrinsic value not simply by presenting a technology that can almost instantly teleport any amount of currency anywhere in the world at any time, but a methodology of TRUST which is communicable, disruptive, and innovative. 
If I can use the Bitcoin protocol to assign assets cryptographically, in a way that is 100 percent verifiable to the owner, and only that owner, do you not now have a value as an intermediary? Of course you do. What we had before as middlemen, escrow or financial services in various forms are about to be replaced by digital cryptographic protocols. That is worth money. The value of Bitcoin the currency is innately tied to this notion. What you cannot see apparently (and this is the straw man for most anti Bitcoin arguments) is that Bitcoin is and never was designed to be an all purpose, all encompassing world currency reserve. It is far more useful in a hybrid economy, where fiat and digital exist cooperatively and in support of one another. And Bitcoin the currency continues to grow in intrinsic value as new, innovative financial vehicles are applied on top of the protocol. Thus Bitcoin the currency has intrinsic value because people trust not in man, but in the protocol as their virtual fed, their virtual JP Morgan, and because this is useful. 
You can't dismiss Bitcoin the currency from Bitcoin the protocol. they are tied to one another and the Tsunami of applications that we are about to witness in this space will truly be awe inspiring. The protocol enables me to own not just Bitcoin, but anything, anywhere. See for example counterparty, ethereum or any of the other Bitcoin 2.0 forms. I can instantly buy your gold, or your oil, and own it without the shadow of a doubt as it sits thousands of miles away in a warehouse with a simple QR code on its barrel. And I can do all of this through an exchange run from someone's garage. Why? Because I don't need to trust the guy in the garage. I trust the math. He just helped me find a customer, and facilitate the buy. I could have done it on my own, but he added to the value of the currency by getting paid a finder's fee though me in BTC, and so on, ad nauseam an economic ecosystem is born. 
Value in the 21st century is a notion that you need to reconsider. If you subscribe to the theory that anything has any intrinsic "value" at all then you have to define precisely what context that value is derived in. In the digital financial space, value is the currency, its protocols, applications, and innovations. Without them, we would be left with a tremendous void, and go back to shipping armored cars full of fiat from place to place. Sound archaic? You bet. 
If your mind cannot grasp the above then rest assured that much "real world", as you say, intrinsic value is stored in the value of all the silicon invested in the massive mining operations that support the network. The value in the companies, persons and software being developed, etc, etc. 
Retool your antiquated vision of what value is and come back down to earth with the rest of us and communicate on a human level. Value is what humans say it is, in the context that they choose to use. If its an MMO gamer, he may value WoW Gold even more than his dollar because it gives him delight to play a game more than engage in "real world" economic activities. It all depends on the human subtext. Bitcoin allows for this communication because now, for the first time, we can utilize and monetize the internet to its full potential and transfer trust over the tubes to anyone, anywhere without fear of misinterpretation. And it is this trust that creates intrinsic value.

This is a common misconception. What this would actually do is cause cryptocurrencies to simply evolve into more anonymous, untrackable varieties. They should be thankful they have bitcoin as it is in its current form and encourage its adoption.

I don't see increasing the blocksize as a relevant means of even beginning to address scalability for a number of very salient reasons:
1.) Bigger blocks immediately incentivizes businesses to start filling them with data. A provable, neutral digital notary is a monumental achievement, and many would like to get their information onto such a platform. This would inundate bitcoin almost certainly, and lead to strain for even bigger blocks, ad infinitum. Where does it end? At what point is decentralization utterly destroyed? Who makes that call? If anything, blocksize increases are a huge detriment to bitcoin and the blocksize should be *reduced* if anything. 
2.) People can still, and will always be able to settle or spend on the bitcoin blockchain directly, via a node, or whatever else. Fees might rise, but second layer solutions are our only hope to addressing global scalability. I don't see how it can be done any other way right now without risking decentralization, one of bitcoin's most important attributes. Let the fees rise and drive market forces to develop and rapidly implement scaling solutions that are provable and off chain, and use the blockchain to settle their balances. None of this impacts an individual's ability to buy a dumb cup of coffee.
3.) Buying a cup of coffee on chain isn't the point. People are ridiculously ignorant about the state of world affairs and the degree to which governments have absolute control over our digital and financial well being. Paypal and VIsa can arbitrarily shit down Wikileaks on any government's order? Hell, no. We must, we absolutely must, preserve bitcoin's security and decentralization in order to combat this growing trend of digital authoritarianism (just look at Britain with the "snooper's charter", and the Snowden revelations, or China's capital controls, or myriad other such developments. Yeah, I'll gladly sacrifice my on chain coffee for a 2nd layer solution in order to combat this trend and preserve the only, yes, the only digital exchangeable bearer asset that no gov controls or can inflate away. Look at prioroties, I say (this is more of a shout out to Ver and his people than you).
4.) Many on the other side are assuming that second layer solutions can't be done fairly or promptly. We musn't sacrifice bitcoin's small footprint and push it into big data centers and places of central control, because at that point bitcoin WILL be well and truly fucked beyond all hope, with no chance of getting it back, so perhaps we proceed slowly, cautiously, with steady research into other solutions before writing all options off and going with the "easy way out", which, obviously, is a simply blocksize increase. 
It just isn't that easy. Few things in life actually are. It's about limited resources, decentralization, and priorities.

How are you wrong? Hey, Our innovative business venture needs a rapid influx of hard currency. True, verifiable, incontrovertible global currency that is ready for the internet age, not the middle age. Teleport that physical gold to me now, would you? I happen to be on a plane to Australia at the moment. 
Oh, you can't. 
We Bitcoiners and Gold bugs are on the same sheet of music ecomonically. Idealistically we often agree for many of the same reasons. Where I differ from Gold bugs is that as a global currency in the internet age, I see Bitcoin as infinitely superior to gold and silver. Just because security mechanisms and innovative solutions for storage haven't fully evolved yet isn't enough, in my eyes, to make that case that physical gold is better than Bitcoin in terms of intrinsic value. Those solutions WILL come, and soon. It isn't hard to convince innovators to program money, and to build software and hardware to store it. 
If I'm going to value something in the internet age, it better be quick and fungible, like Bitcoin. Stockpiling tons of metal just doesn't work in today's age. We ought to consider something better.

Layer 2 technologies Lightning, Mimblewimble, Lumino, Sidechains etc completely reimagine what we can do here. I know this probably doesn't fit your narrative, but it is the innovation without permission that is indeed driving bitcoin specifically. The most important thing about bitcoin is the blockchain's security and trust model. The fact that it has the first mover advantage and reputation that it does. This trust layer is by far THE most important characteristic and serves as the backbone for everything else. Newer solutions may evolve, but would you TRUST them to do what they say they are going to do? Perhaps, perhaps not. The risk is all yours buddy.

I suppose many here have seen this coming for so long that it is not a big surprise.

Because if they do concoct a verified address scheme the groundwork for blacklisted addresses and so forth will be a very real issue. 
If this becomes the case then one could speculate that does this not hamstring the core devs from instituting core protocol changes that preserve anonymity such as tumbler functions/other anonymity enhancements, because any such code change would then stand to disenfranchise a huge section of the bitcoin economy (China).

I was at this presentation in San Antonio and the title is very misleading. The questioner was asking about their plans for the currency in-game and Bitcoin was brought up almost as an aside or joke, albeit in a fairly positive way. 
It is still relevant and significant, because the creator, Chris Roberts (the creator of the Wing Commander series) has made the most successful kickstarter ever, with over 70 million pledged by the backers. There are no big time publishers of this game.. it is a purely crowdfunded masterpiece whose demand is derived from what the player base themselves want to see.
After the conference I got to thinking, with all of the uncertainty surrounding in game currencies and particularly with the advent of a huge market for trading virtual "in-game" currencies for real life money, would it not make sense to finally put one of these games' currency systems on a blockchain? 
Let's assume that CIG (the game producer of Star Citizen) decided to create its own crypto currency (lets call it the UEE credit for example, and yes, I have made a changetip moniker by this name and use it to tip in the Star Citizen reddit sub), they could mathematically prove where all of the transactions are going, and preempt fraud and hacking/dupes with this kind of money. 
This kind of system would allow for a more robust in game economy; one that is based on verifiable currency, rather than relying on the developer to inject random and possibly massive amounts of virtual currency at a whim. You would allow for mathematically provable scarcity, which would, along with overwhelming demand for ships and items sold by the game itself, generate value as a medium of exchange to the participants. It would also make it easy to securely transfer credits offline, through Bitcoin-like wallets on your phone. 
Further, this kind of currency, because it is blockchain based, would allow for NPCs (non player characters, or computer controlled characters for the uninitiated), to possess verifiable amounts of currency themselves. This would allow for interesting scenarios where NPCs could have their own virtual wallets which grow or diminish based on their behavior, and you could see bounties generated for them if they adopted piracy and so on. Ships could trade currency with one another, and exchange value based on pre determined conditions. There are so many incredible possibilities. 
One thing that amused me about Star Citizen was seeing a lot of the concept art include "banks" in the far future in them. With a Bitcoin like currency, money would simply be a content type, like an MP3 or text message. This is one of the most fundamental things that, to me, was a revelation in discovering Bitcoin. Bytes of data sent anywhere in the universe to accomplish value exchange between digital wallets. Wallets that can be anywhere... your ship, on your Mobiglas, in your jump drive, hell, even in one of your weapons. 
@_date: 2015-01-22 15:21:52
I agree that wallets should evolve to become far more user friendly and customizable. It will happen, just remember that we are at the very early stages still. 
We need to move past QR codes and Bitcoin addresses as the visible, front facing UI representations of what a Bitcoin wallet should look like. It's all a part of mainstream adoption, and it will occur as natural market forces will inevitably dictate.

This is my attempt at a redditor's layman response. Disclaimer: I am nowhere near an exepert, but I do follow the times, so I will do my best to provide my version of an answer:
Miners have a direct incentive to participate rationally in the network. If they contribute to a 51% attack, they would be, in essence, destroying themselves, because a lack of confidence in the system would likely affect the entire ecosystem, from the value of the Bitcoins that they earn through solving blocks, to the transactions that they will (increasingly) be relying on to sustain their ongoing quest to beat the electricity costs of doing business. 
In the future, with ever more investment in efficient expensive, single purpose hardware that cannot be used for any other tasks (ASIC miners), further costs to threatening the network are implied. Razor thin margins of profit dictated by the competitive electricity market make such a proposition of a 51% attack not unlike economic suicide. 
Therefore, the Bitcoin network operates on the principle of economic rationality and competition for scare resources which drives it towards a solution to fix itself, assuming that Mining continues to become further centralized and the perceived threat of a 51% attack becomes greater. 
Additionally, it is very, very expensive to execute a coordinated 51% attack against the network. Such an attack would cost upwards of hundreds of millions of USD and only allow a limited number of overspends before the rest of the network notices. And as the difficulty continues to rise, the access to the latest mining hardware becomes more and more competitive, so to suggest that a single player could simply waltz into a mining manufacturer and demand enough hardware to overtake the network is implausible. The waiting queue for new miners is over 6 months for some people, and the order books fill very quickly. 
So, it makes sense for this rational network to find a way to sustain and improve itself, ever growing in new ways to be efficient and cut costs however possible, so that the strength and value of the token is a direct result of the network that secures it. Mining centralization is inevitable, and the network has a direct incentive to expend just as many resources to ensure that it does not endanger the very source of the network itself.

Bitcoin isn't ready for everyone in the world to use it to buy coffee on chain. That's the whole point. Proceed at in measured, logical, consensus driven manner so that one day, layers on top of bitcoin can scale to infinity. 
On the other hand, if we push hard now for brute force solutions to real, long term problems through blocksize increases, we risk damaging the only thing that *truly* sets bitcoin apart... decentralized global tokens of value that allow people to move around money without a third party. 
I suggest patience. Bitcoin has tremendous utility as a stateless form of value exchange, even if you can't use it to buy a coffee with instant confirmations. We don't *need* that right now. That comes later.

Indeed, I agree that while gold is great as a store of value, how do we know exactly how much is in circulation? Is it based on mining reports, and if so, how can we trust the authenticity of every single report? I think the truth is that we don't really have anything near to an idea as to how much is in circulation in comparison to say, a digital gold, i.e., Bitcoin, where one can know exactly how much (at a maximum) is in circulation and how much will be in circulation on any given day in the future. 
Of course, Bitcoin can be lost forever (quite easily in fact) and the amount in circulation will always be less than what is shown on the blockchain. Just referencing that article a year or so ago about that guy who was searching the landfill for his lost hard drive with over 10,000 Bitcoins on it... it was never found if I recall. While 21 million Bitcoins can ever exist, I'd wager far less are actually accessible by human hands.

Why doesn't he get that you can build whatever layers you want on top of Bitcoin, e.g., more centralized service providers that do allow for reversibility, financial gymnastics, etc. 
The idea has to start with a unit of value that makes it all work... something pure, open source, decentralized, global. And that idea is Bitcoin. 
Or maybe he knows this, and is simply making the distinction that Bitcoin in and of itself is not suited to this use case. But personally, I get the gut feeling that even amongst the technorati, there are huge misconceptions about what Bitcoin is and can be, and that many of them are still in the phase of, "ehh.. nerd money".

Thanks, I think that something fairly centralized but on a blockchain would be an interesting experiment. If it were on a public ledger, players could check on the money base daily, and be assured that rampant inflation due to hacks or dupes are not taking place. One of the other interesting ideas for developers is that a centralized, premined, blockchain based currency would enable easier accounting of currency, and more transparent tools for examining the state of the economy. One could know exactly where all the flow is going, at what rate, and so on. You could check balances that belong to players/NPCs and other entities, provided they are publicly known. And using a proprietary wallet they could securely allow players to transfer this currency from their smartphones offline.

Fundamentally, hilariously wrong on so many levels. 
Unlike you, Fed, Bitcoin's actual protocol does not permit "money printing into prosperity" at the slightest whim and whisper of an unelected group of individuals. Individuals who's intentions must be divined through bend-over- backwards adjective interpretation. 
So while the Fed is running out of adjectives to describe is intentions, bitcoin continues on subject to the governance of its users. So much so that everything from to top to bottom is transparent and subject to peer review. 
One can use this protocol to calculate precisely how many bitcoins will have been released into circulation on any given date in the future. One can't say that the fed has anything like this kind of intellectual honesty in place, much less a working "protocol". Hell, Draghi's protocol is,  "whatever it takes"... how long until we get there, Fed?

People like OP and Jeffery Tucker make me truly sick. While I agree with some of their views with regard to egregious overreach of the state, it  must be pointed out that they enjoy the freedoms and consitutional protections that they cling to so tightly when confronted with legal challenges and confrontations with the state. And yet these protections they so conveniently shun when they espouse blind anarchism without a concrete plan for what to actually do in the vacuum of a society without laws. 
It is those very laws that many less fortunate souls fought and died for throughout history, defying tyranny to give us the protections that these haughty individuals so casually brush aside when it is convenient for them. Preaching from on high using the very backs of the men and women who fought and died as platforms from which to freely speak. Try all that in a realm of true tyranny.

This is really hilarious and quite encouraging, actually. Number one, they are on the defensive, totally. Iterating on the blockchain with a centrally planned alternative, that, in actuality, *provides even more incentive* to actually disassociate with the current financial system and bypass it using bitcoin. Mr. Broadbent, you are so misguided.
They don't realize that this provides *more* counterparty risk because it is not decentralized and vulnerable to state actors and espionage, not to mention needing to thread the needle of every single regionalized legal paradigm. 
Bitcoin skips all that my inventing its own, new, private system of money whereby all of the aforementioned legal obstacles are conveniently bypassed though decentralization. If governments could stop bitcoin, they already would have. They are now on the defensive attempting to invent centrally planned, and inferior alternatives.

So let me get this straight. You are by your own admission a complete newbie to bitcoin with practically no skin in the game and you are out on a dedicated subreddit handing out financial advice? 
It's interesting to take note of what this place has become as of late, with all the downvote bots, ethereum spammers, buttcoiners, paid manipulators on throwaway accounts, ad nauseam. 
And to imagine each one of these has most likely levied a quite strong and impassioned "judgement" on the blocksize issue...

The only reason they always discount Bitcoin when mentioning the fascinating blockchain tech is that they lack control over Bitcoin, and that they cannot abide. But lack of control and decentralization is KEY to the basic premise that this whole concept is founded on.
You can't, it is impossible, to discount Bitcoin. It establishes the economic incentive for a distributed, trustless ledger in the very first place. 
If you want to use a blockchain without an economic incentive, it simply becomes akin to a google docs spreadsheet.

Ok, what you fail to realize is that most of the people here have already encountered this absurd line of reasoning so many times in this sub that it is almost trivial to shoot down and discredit at this point. But I'll introduce you. 
The President does *not* have a point. This is an absolute issue, even as he, in his own words, openly recognizes that he has no technical clue about what is going on here. Encryption must be allowed to proliferate because it is increasingly all that separates us from government surveillance and intrusion into every aspect of our digital lives. And as those lives become more and more integrated with digital media, the more you are vulnerable without encryption. 
If a single backdoor is permitted, then everything is open. No security can be truly realized, because by design, a backdoor exists. You do not know who has permission to use that door, and you can never, ever track the status of the keyholders. IF the NSA promises to be a good steward of your digital diary, would you trust them with all of your basest thoughts for the rest of your life?  Who is to say that the NSA employee in charge of your file could not turn rogue, as Snowden did, and take off with means to access not only your data, but millions of others? What then? The President creates a false narrative that "sounds good" and gives a "warm fuzzy" to the non-technical listener when he creates arguments that imply that we can truly limit access to "just the important selected few". That is truly idiotic and if you are falling for that narrative, I've got some beachside property in Montana I'd like to sell you. Information propagates, it spreads. Thats what it does. Hackers hack, and people steal and are betrayed. That's the whole point. We need to be able to escape from this and truly secure our digital privacy.
Another ridiculous point overlooked by your side is the pure hypocrisy of the fact that the President himself uses a Blackberry device that is encrypted. Is he willing to give up his data to surveillance? At what threshold do you become important or influential enough to warrant your own such device that cannot be cracked or broken into? But you wouldn't consider this because you would probably decree that the President is "more important than the rest of us". And thus declare that by admission, you are nothing more than a meaningless serf whose most innermost thoughts and private data are less important than those of another man. 
Equality isn't just a watchword you use when you attend Bernie Sanders rallies. And it applies to more than just race, creed, color. It applies to data and digitized thoughts. It is a moral and social imperative that can now, through encryption, be tested- and as this is occurring in plain view, mathematically, verifiably, we are seeing the true tyrants show themselves through this litmus test. 
You mention criminals. Well again, I hate to burst your bubble, but criminals, *by definition* will not stop using unbreakable encryption just because it is illegal. So *poof* you and the big O. have just enabled true global Orwellian surveillance for the *good* people out there. And that is the reality of the situation. What you'd really accomplish is precisely what they want: control and data harvesting over the populace, while being subject to their own FISA courts, which, again by definition and the Patriot Act, are secret. 
The government can still apprehend criminals. They have to conduct *real* detective work to do so, and this should be *hard*. It should be extremely difficult to lock someone up for a heinous crime. And this is why we have the professionals in law enforcement and intelligence agencies. We *want* them to do those kinds of jobs and be highly successful in their duties to our country. What we *don't want to do is allow the state (or whoever is control of it at that current moment in history) to have complete control over our entire online existence. Because if you are not a Donald Trump supporter, nothing scares you more than the notion of that administration having full control and judgement over your data. 
Just because it's Obama, right here, right now in March of 2016, doesn't give you the right to be flippant or short sighted about this.

Also, there should be nothing keeping them from proposing what they want and sticking to their guns. I admire them for doing that because I ultimately feel that they are right. In my view, bitcoin is a terribad personal payment system right now. The only way that I think it will realistically scale is through the kinds of solutions that they are proposing long term. 
In the near term, it logically makes no sense to jeopardize decentralization and easy access to world internet markets (slow connections), in order to add a little bit more capacity. 2M is a chimera, a bandaid, a false hope. An inelegant, brutish solution to a valid, long term problem. 
Real solutions are in progress. 
Once you look realistically at what bitcoin is *right now* you can see that it really isn't a great payment layer for coffees. This blockchain doesn't really handle that well. It's the ability to circumnavigate state controlled financial systems using a settlement layer with room for more sophisticated layers on top. To me, that is what is most important in bitcoin. All else revolves around this basic premise. 
@_date: 2016-03-03 01:23:56
Why should this be surprising? Core developers and fellow bitcoiners *NEED* to understand that this is a highly contentious, politically charged, greed-induced testosterone pit, and we should have the cahones to continue the debate. 
Volatility introduced (in any minute way) by brigaders is most certainly used to generate movements in the marketplace and hence, money for day traders, of which I'm sure r/btc is mainly comprised of. 
People need to just stay the course, and rationally analyze all sides to an argument while not affording too much seriousness to the troll factions that will be ever-present here. Focus instead on real innovations and developments that make the entire community grow, yes, sometimes even if seemingly in spite of itself. 
Because in the end, who, indeed even knows what the "bitcoin community" really is? It's an abstract concept and mostly a figment of people's imagination.

This is exactly what I am talking about. I am wondering about "paper Bitcoin contracts" that are not accompanied by any sort of key verification of ownership, as it were. So yes, fractional reserve Bitcoin. The reason why I think this is significant is that it could be a way for incumbents to take one of Bitcoin's supposed key characteristics (scarcity) and co opt it to a degree, and in so doing, kill it similar to what we have to day (fractional reserve everything).

Bitcoin is backed by the value of a real, functioning invention that is used worldwide; a blockchain technology that cannot be uninvented, which is secured by a multinational hashing network of miners. It presents the possibility to develop a new universe of financial applications. Bitcoin shouldnt be pegged to stocks, you have it the wrong way around.

From a reply to one of my comments by &gt; found that increasing the dbcache memory significantly speeds up the initial sync process. The default was set to 100mb and would take almost a month to sync. I increased it to 8000 and it synced over night. Afterwards you can decrease it again to something reasonable for your machine.
I find that my node consumes about 150gb per month on a fiber connection with no inbound connection limiting, or bandwidth tinkering. But then again, I have an ISP that allows this. You might want to check and see what you can handle before you get hit with overages or throttling. Not to dissuade you, but rather, prevent any surprises!
Edit: I also find that I am able to perfectly stream Netflix, HD YouTube vids, and game with the node running on a spare iMac. No problems, and I am very pleased with how it has turned out so far. 
It is very empowering to see my node on the [geographic node representation on the Bitnodes website]( Very empowering.

In certain circles, this is referred to as being, "bluepilled". What that means is that your mind and philosophical condition cannot adapt to the concept of the free and open disposition of human sovereignty. 
Bitcoin is one of those few things that pushes this narrative out in front of people and makes them confront it. It's why some people so vigorously oppose it. Like being forced to wake up from the Matrix, it forces you to realize that if you want to be, you are truly free, but that freedom comes with the cold, stark realization that liberty can be a quite stark and forbidding realm.

Money goes in, bitcoin doesn't come out. Hence, the price difference. There is a market driven reason for this, and it surely isn't the result of natural (healthy) demand driven economic indicators that show adoption or any other important metric of the bitcoin economy.

No. It's not this. It's mainly about ease of access as I have heard countless devs state that # of nodes is merely a measure of how user-friendly it is to set one up. 
This is really true, as I finally jumped in and spooled up mine, and it was all quite easy with the exception of learning how to port forward 8333. But even that was eventually no problem.. it was just a setting in my AT&amp;T firewall that a quick call to tech support resolved. 
This is really about informing people that they, too, can easily run a node with little work and cost, and participate in the network. Education and information are the key.

Some businesses may not *want* the transparent, trackable properties of the bitcoin blockchain. Confidential transactions might help them protect their books while still transacting with bitcoin. 
Also, censorship resistance, and state-neutral global exchange of a valuable, anonymous digital bearer asset *is in itself* a killer app, regardless of what anyone thinks. This has already been proven, else bitcoin would not still be in use today. 
Further, law enforcement, in this case, might simply move adoption to countries more favorable to harboring bitcoin, while starving out others and creating valuable arbitrage opportunities. We don't need to appease everyone to flourish.

For me the trickiest part was port forwarding port 8333. To do that I had to configure my AT&amp;T firewall to allow it. I knew I was successful when I saw inbound connections. Without that, I only saw 8 outbound connections, which is good to begin downloading and verifying the block chain, but not to interact as a full node. 
Also don't be suprised if downloading the entire block chain from scratch initially takes days. .14 was supposed to speed this up a bit, but I downloaded it before this upgrade.

You're being incredibly disingenuous. Bitcoin is the first, most secure blockchain. It is the blockchain that everyone else chases both in terms of market capitalization and security. These are fundamentals that are driving it. 
So you don't want to tinker with bitcoin itself too much for fear of upsetting this security and functionality that has provided the bedrock for the crypto space as a whole. It Bitcoin falls, so do all coins. 
Therefore, you conduct rapid innovation at scale on layer two technologies which are tied to bitcoin using the same cryptographic security principles that bitcoin uses. Except now you have the added bonus that can do experimentation *without having to worry about upsetting the base layer that supports it all*. 
At the end of the day you can *still send bitcoin directly* to people using any free wallet. Nothing changes there on the base layer. Fees will actually even go down due to more transactions transferring over to the second layer. This is the best way forward.

This was the sticking point for me for a while when I initially set mine up. 
The solution was to ensure that in both the router and residential gateway settings port 8333 was being forwarded. I actually had to call AT&amp;T to ensure that this port wasn't being blocked on their end and they reported that it was not. Since I am using a fiber connection, the gateway/modem provided by AT&amp;T required it's own settings to be configured independent of the router. Once I did both of these tasks, I went to: 
 to check the incoming connections and immediately it worked. This was very rewarding, because, like you, I spent quite a bit of time learning and experimenting and fiddling about before I finally got it. 
One other thing to try: if you're using a USB dongle, try instead a full node on a PC or Mac first, using the same internet connection. Seriously, getting the node up and running on all cylinders is as simple as downloading the software and forwarding the port. If you get it working on a full PC, maybe the problem is with the dongle itself.
@_date: 2017-03-16 16:59:34
If you have any problems downloading the block chain initially, try increasing the cache setting in the options. It can speed up initial sync significantly. 
Also, if you have trouble port forwarding port 8333, advise. The walk through for this is on the core website, but sometimes people still have trouble with it because of firewalls, etc.

Kind of hard to make up your mind on Lightning so early. It's still in it's infancy, and you should expect to see more rapid innovation there than on bitcoin because....
Layer 2 technology rides on top of, instead of *within* bitcoin itself. What that means is that unilke Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash, you can make very interesting projects without worrying about harming the underlying security that supports it all. So if Bitcoin is the fundamentally sound base layer for all of this innovation, then you don't need to fork your blockchain every five minutes like Ethereum does, or like Bitcoin Cash has. Achieving scale and groundbreaking innovation now becomes a capitalistic, and competitive *incentive* rather than disincentive, because you don't need to fork the underlying base layer to do cool things... And forking blockchains requires overwhelming consensus (which is hard to get in decentralized structures) or centralization (a boss like Ver who can just outweigh the opposition through politics). Both of the latter methods imply that the underlying blockchain is not secure in it's fundamentals (assume they wanted to change the 21 million coin limit or somesuch). 
Putting radical innovation in a sandbox on layer 2 is genius, and the absolute correct way forward. Bitcoin itself remains steadfast and stoic, providing the solid core for everything else to be built upon. 
But people in the space who call themselves "investors" who are actually just speculators, don't really care about the tech. They just want to get rich off of it. So they lack the patience required to allow layer 2 tech to mature and develop. We need to be patient and allow these fledgling projects on the second layer to blossom and grow, and then determine where to go. Instead of forking the Bitcoin blockchain every 5 minutes due to the whimsy of some "great idea or project" that comes along. This destroys the fundamental soundness of the blockchain.

Ether "investors" like to denigrate bitcoin holders, but when you listen to what they have to say, it's the same kind of silicon valley watchword crap that we used to use back in the early days. 
"Making the world a better place through technology". "Its really different this time".
Yeah, bullshit. They are trading their common sense for the hope of riches, and one need only take a brief perusal of the r/ethereum sub to smell the amount of hopium being smoked in that place, especially as it pertains to trust in the the ethereum foundation's ability to extricate the plebs out of this mess, and Vitalik's position as beneficent dictator. 
Them co-opting exchanges to deny the free market the opportunity to sell out of the situation that they created themselves was just absurd and contravenes every ideological premise that most of them seem to hold. That is, until something threatens their funds, in which case, soft fork, hard fork, whatever means necessary to get their money back. They have zero credibility, in my book. None.

Bitcoin is the most secure of all the blockchains. It is also the oldest and most robust, and most decentralized. 
Speed and scalability, just like with innovation on the internet itself, will take place on top of, or on layer 2 sandboxes (like the Lightning Network) which allow people to really get jiggy with their projects without having to worry about breaking the fundamental, rock solid core at the heart of it.

That is a straw man argument. Many here who know anything substantial about blockchains know that they are not immutable in the absolute sense. 
They become immutable in scale and though network effect to the point where it becomes disastrous economically to implement one unless most participants are in complete agreement. 
This is a feature, not a bug. The main value proposition of the bitcoin blockchain is that is resists such attempts (as we saw with Classic). This is a great thing, and preserves the integrity of the system, as well as the trust in the blockchain. 
The minute you try to change the 21 million coin limit, or the distribution schedule, you will see how difficult it would be to achieve any change. The main reason people support such a fork in Ethereum is that the community is loaded with hypocrite day-traders and speculators who vociferously desire a bailout of the DAO. 
So while they touted the DAO as "not a flaw in Ethereum, rather a flaw in the software programming for the DAO itself", they have the absolute hypocrisy and audacity to fork, and thereby blacklist within the core protocol itself to reclaim tokens from it! Incredible. 
This destroys the proposition of Ethereum as a useful currency or contract system if you have to result to human intervention to arbitrate something totally unrelated to the core protocol. This shows that a few stakeholders and day traders can purposefully hijack the system to reclaim money that they, themsleves willingly placed in a flawed and untested DAO. And then ask that the rest of the community endure a hard fork for their troubles. 
This is juvenile and selfish. I was very happy to see the bitcoin system respond in a neutral way when Gox happened, and during the Classic dust up. If day traders and speculators can do this to Ethereum, imagine what regulators and lawyers will do to it once they get involved in the future. 
A hard fork is horrifically bad for their long term viability because it violates the faith anyone has in the persistence and resilience of their blockchain to resist temptation, be it external, or in this case, internal. 
When you get down to it, you can see that this is really about money, and they caved to save themselves.

Bitcoin fundamentalists will never tell you about all of their lost bitcoin, or their friends'. It happens. 
People in this space *will* (and I say will because it doesn't matter what they think or feel about bitcoin "sovereignty", etc.), learn that the vast majority of people cannot be bothered or trusted to properly store bitcoin. Plain and simple. 
That day may come, but it is still a long way off. Using a digital asset that is subject to all of the online hacking schemes of the world is simply nerve wracking. 
For those who don't want to worry about this, there are custodial services. And services like this still advance the proposition of Bitcoin, even if indirectly. 
So before Bitcoin maximalists get their panties all in a wad about "muh bitcoin sovereignty" maybe step back and take a look at the real world. The world in which many people cannot even properly operate a computer operating system let alone an extremely valuable digital asset.

Andreas Antonopolous likes to make this ongoing metaphor to the printing press after the advent of the internet. 
As in, now everyone has access to an open source of information and trust. Whereas previously only centralized thought and trust brokers could distribute this information out to the masses. 
Like the internet before it, Bitcoin democratized the idea of money online. So now the REAL metric of "what is money" resides instead in it's usefulness to people, rather than the mandates of government and authorities.
It turns money itself into a competitive process, whereby the authority is no longer needed or even desired-rather, the ability to be used and shifted around without relying on intermediaries and firewalls that can shut people down or shut them out of their finances. 
So of course the ECB will not cede that Bitcoin is money. But they WILL state that the idea of blockchain (which Bitcoin created, by the way) does gain praise because they can use it to create [separate currency platforms]( which DO comply with their trust model. Which do shut people out at the press of a button. [Which DO, by design, prevent commerce when this or that government disagrees with that person's actions.](
So in order to be intellectually honest, if the ECB agrees with the idea of blockchain (which again, we, the Bitcoin community provided them), and the entire function and idea of Bitcoin relies on the core premise of the blockchain, then how is it not completely hypocritical of them to say "[we like blockchain but not Bitcoin](

Trying to sell it to grocers in Asia using the blockchain.info wallet. So bitcoin and bitcoin cash both transmit instantaneously, but require some time to clear a confirmation in a block.

Running a node is fairly easy. Any decent modern computer can do it, provided you have a good internet connection. I encourage you to visit the Bitcoin Core website and follow the plain english instructions on how to download the client and set it up. 
The trickiest part was learning how to port forward my router to allow port 8333 to see incoming connections. To do this I followed the instructions on the Bitcoin Core website, and also contacted AT&amp;T tech support to ensure that number 1 they allowed port 8333 on their gigapower (fiber optic 1gb/sec) broadband. The rep I talked to didn't even know what bitcoin was, lol. I was talked through how to configure the fiber optic gateway's firewall to make an exception for port 8333. After that I immediately saw inbound connections to my node. 
If a technical novice such as me can do it, practically anyone can. Just ensure your internet provider/data caps allow for the data you will consume (for me over 100gb per month). But even this parameter can be adjusted in the software to decrease data usage to preclude over limit charges or throttling by your ISP. 
Learn about it. It's a hobby, a project and a political stance, in a way. Bitcoin isn't quite ready for grandma just yet, and that's a good thing. We'll get these things sorted first, and the late comers always pile on when they feel it is a no brainer.

This speech is beyond absurd and riddled with contradictions... and in many cases factually untrue. Where do we start? A few things come to mind:


Says a guy talking to a group of central counterparties. 
And yet, 


First off, [False](
Second, the real reason banks are investigating blockchains is that they cannot exert control over bitcoin's blockchain, and that, to them, is terrifying. 
They cannot print money on a whim, or exert control over participants, and freeze or censor transactions throughout the process. In short, it is about one thing: control. The fact that people like the speaker pander to those looking to spend billions on consultants like this, is testament to why we need *truly* decentralized, anonymous, censorship resistant networks, which, is precisely the opposite of what is described here. 
So on the one hand, speaker says the efficiencies lie in skipping counterparties, but wait. Isn't the banks' blockchain the new counterparty? Does it not hold the fiduciary risk inso much as it is presumed to be "secure", "non transparent", and "fast"? This is doublespeak. The blockchain was invented to truly remove the necessity for entities like banks, in that the trusted counterparty is an open, neutral source of truth in the bitcoin blockchain. Not a guise of trust created by a consortium of banks to create digital walled gardens. 
Gardens that become poisonous as hell once things get bad, and capital controls/government censorship find their way into their roots...

In my experience setting up a full node was cumbersome from a number of standpoints. Getting the router to port forward 8333 was tricky involving a lot of fiddling with the fiber gateway and the router itself. Also a call to AT&amp;T to make sure they weren't blocking it. 
Then there was the initial block sync and the UI of the core wallet itself to deal with. 
Not to mention the hundreds of gigabytes in data usage consumed every month. 
For me, running the node is a project and a contribution to the system, but damn. Who in their right mind would think that 99% of people out there would be able to spin one of these up. 
Is Luke saying that Bitcoin isn't for 99% of people? I doubt that, but still, real world interactions with actual human beings suggests that unless the process becomes a 1 click affair with NOT ONLY small blocks but significantly easier onboarding, people will always sacrifice a little privacy for ease of use. 
Or ask for privacy implementations in the Bitcoin Core software itself without needing to spool up and run a full node. 
There are plenty, PLENTY of people out there who want Bitcoin's access to unhindered digital markets, potential economic gains and relative anonymity without being able to understand how to operate a full node. It's just a fact of life. Luke can deny it all he wants but unless he demonstrates why in real world terms using real people as examples, I will never believe him.

"Opt in". Ok so in 5 years the basic Android wallet will be like:
"Your bitcoin wallet would like to request access to:
-Your contact list
-Your Phone storage
-Your Browsing history
-Your Photos
-Your Microphone
-Your Camera
-Your Keyboard
-Your Clipboard
"Opt in" can easily become the de facto standard, which leaves consumers out of the loop and trapped into another form of capital control mechanism. The whole premise of bitcoin is to avoid such "solutions". And yes, even if that means at the expense of usability, until better "solutions" can be found. This is like trying to add KYC to gold. Just don't. Build that stuff on top of other layers of bitcoin that will emerge over time. 
Also, bitcoin is around the law, not above it, simply because the moment you "ban/restrict" it, the moment another form of cryptocurrency evolves to replace it. What about the marvel of cryptocurrency don't you get?
It amuses me how difficult a time you statists have with the concept that you are now truly free to express the value of a week's worth of work in a value transfer system that YOU, and WE, the people, control... not the government.

If you were smart, you'd immediately spend that (soon to be) hyperinflating fiat dollar on all of your higher interest rate debt. Which would simply funnel that money back to the banks, somewhat deleting the stimulative effect of the helicopter money policy in the first place. 
But wait, wouldn't most plebes just go out and buy the latest car or flat screen TV? Yeah, maybe but what policy makers fail to realize is that the product cycle is slowing down in many sectors, and millenials don't need new cars every 2 years like their baby boomer parents did. Appliances, vehicles and gadgets all last considerably longer these days, both in a reliability and utility perspective. This has a further dampening effect on the consumer economy because we really don't see the need for an iphone 14 when the iphone 12 worked just fine and the innovations gradually petered out. 
They fail to see the transformative period the economy is currently undergoing. The old is being displaced by the new, and they simply.can't.accept it. 
We have been going on almost 10 years of QE and low interest rates and still the global economy is stagnating, or worse. One might argue that even the current "innovations" AI, autonomous vehicles, VR etc are all still too late to market to save goverments from drastic scale back and reordering of world affairs based off of a newer, slower, more sane economic paradigm. 
This is all just market driven pressures slowly emerging from the muddied waters of years of fiscal policy that merely forestalled this inevitability.

Bitcoin is exponentially more fungible because far more exchanges accept Bitcoin than monero. Further, most exchanges actually convert monero to Bitcoin before redeeming for cash because noone wants to actually pay cash for some shitcoin.

I strongly disagree:


verify the identity of the person sending payment. A person is not required to verify the identify of a person sending payment if the payment is sent by a verified identity digital currency
What this actually means is that anyone with a bitcoin wallet will not be able to receive bitcoin legally because there is no established way to verify the identity of anyone in the world who may be sending you bitcoin at any given time. In fact, some companies, such as Chainalysis send dust to your account in order to track your wallet's behaviors. This would be illegal. It would, like I said, essentially stifle and attempt to kill any use of state-unathorized cryptocurrency, which is tantamount to fascism. 


Lol what? No you don't. This rarely happens, if ever. In restaurants, gas stations, store counters, Wal Marts, ID is practically never used. It hinders the process and Visa is willing to take the hit for a chargeback, that's why their fees are higher. 


Wrong again, you can easily get cash back at Wal Mart with a debit card and no PIN. 


I agree with you here, this bill is just ridiculously worded and hopelessly biased towards, most probably, JP Morgan Coin or some other concern that wants to see state-run fascism and regulatory firewalls over freedom of choice and innovation for Texans. 
It's amazing to me. Texans so pride themselves on their freedom of movement, expression, private property rights and so on. And yet when the rubber hits the road with a truly transformative technology like Bitcoin that *mathematically demands* some of these principles get put to the test in the face of the most powerful and penalized [(in terms of bank fines)]( institutions on earth (the banks themselves), we begin to see the cracks in the armor.

@_date: 2017-08-16 16:53:46


Perhaps some are speculating. But also consider that some, indeed, many in this space know significantly more about the underlying technology and economics that you might realize. And suppose I told you that what you might traditionally label, "speculation" in FOREX/currency, is now morphing into something different altogether with appearances of a legacy system. 
What I mean by that is consider Bitcoin and the blockchain as more than just a currency system but as a payment system, network, and protocol for an entirely new financial system. Consider also that the amount of innovation and develpment significantly rises as the price elevates, and, among other things (such as rewarding miners with a higher block reward), creates a positive feedback loop. 
Consider that the space in a block is finite, and the justification for bitcoin's very existence and usefulness is infact hinging on the recognition by common users, or, "speculators" as you might say, who by their very transactions create a system that is more viable and useful. The more users and members of the public that use bitcoin, recognize it. The more commonly it is used and the higher the price, the more governments are forced to address it. So in this loop of perception, social constructs and governmental authority regarding what we perceive as "money" something new arises by bootstrapping itself with the very "speculation" that you suggest. Indeed, the dollar ain't gonna replace itself. Not that I am suggesting that bitcoin would, but this project got zero help from outside the crypto community. It survived on it's own and indeed flourished by completing the loop I described above. 
So I don't think that it is quite so easy to look down your nose at bitcoin buyers as speculators. It might just be that they comprehend preserving value in a trustless system that very few others understand or even recognize. To others it is speculating. To those in the know, it's investing in the future of money.

Yes, start from scratch on your PC using the most simple manner possible using the least amount of variables to troubleshoot.  Download and install Bitcoin and then get to work in your router and modem settings to ensure that port 8333 is forwarded and not blocked. If it isn't being blocked, you'll see the node on the network using the bitnodes tool. You'll want to see something like this: 
I'm sure the problem is likely that the port is being blocked. If you're really stuck, recommend calling a local IT specialist in your area to walk you through the process. Once you get it, you'll probably smack yourself in the head for realizing how simple it was. For me, I just had to really dig in the settings for the gateway. At&amp;T had an extensive application list on there that allows the user to block all kinds of services like Netflix, games, etc etc. I had to actually create a new service, named it "bitcoin" and then assigned it to port 8333, and saved. It worked after that.

Let the suckers be had, and stop worrying about them so much, because they will *always* be there, falling for the FUD, starting price posts to the effect of, "the price is dropping, what's going on??", ad nauseam. 
We don't need to adjust based on the capricious temperments of the nouveau. This would be damaging something wonderful for the sake of the ignorant; terrible strategy. If they find their purposes served by bitcoin they will return regardless. Bitcoin doesn't even solve most of their problems right now, anyway (yet).

We're playing with fire here, and quite trivially, I might add. Bitcoin is a powerful tool, and it's applications are so vastly understated that using the term, "bubble" is simply intellectual masturbation.

So Assange encoded the keys to the wikileaks insurance files into the bitcoin blockchain? If so, that's genius,  and precisely what bitcoin was meant for; censorship resistance and perfect transparency (not just financial) in an age of deleted twitter accounts and modified Google search results. 
Or is he saying that the images for the files themselves are coded in to the OP_return space?  I know it's possible to eventually upload data and even entire images into the blockchain with a bunch of transactions,  but I thought the original insurance files were ~90gb. 
Anyway,  if he did do it this way,  [James D'Angelo was right]( and the blockchain is the single most important historical preservation mechanism in human history.

Wait, what?
[Blocksigning is already a thing.]( All you are doing is having the blockchain serve as the intermediary at practically no cost, saving you the time and hassle of having someone digitally record and timestamp the hash of the file that has your deed on it. This deed, as it comes to you from the title office, is recorded forever in the blockchain which serves the purpose of verifying ownership claims, instead of relying on the "word" or "trust" of the local courthouse or administration. 
You don't need to secure the private key of anything. You are simply timestamping a file to preserve it forever for verification of authenticity. 
If bitcoin is suitable as serving as a source of trust for any atomic unit of money, and people adopt this, it is then useful for serving as a token of trust/ownership for ANYTHING.

What's interesting is that I haven't seen Coinbase engage in paid reddit postings to subtly advertise their product. It just works, and there is no need to use this kind of trickery to leech customers.

I always thought how neat it would be if payments could be sent across Twitter with integrated wallets or attached to tweets. 
I mean, it doesn't matter where in the world you are, you could receive a payment instantly without permission. Their social media platform would be a very interesting use case for small payments on mobile because no account setup necessary. Every account could come with it's own "tip jar".
One of the things Andreas used to mention in his talks was how exchange of money is a form of societal communication. And I think that really rings true. The power to freely exchange value across borders is a very powerful and compelling tool to have. It stands to reason that this whole other form of abstract communication should be a part of social media in general.

That's the key concept. Millenials and Gen Z'ers could give a shit about gold (I don't mean to ruffle feathers with this but it is my honest interpretation of the situation based off personal interactions), and the aging baby boomers who grew up being instructed by their fathers to cling to this relic know this in the back of their minds, and are starting to get worried. Not that I blame them. Bitcoin is eminently more suitable and accessible to younger folks in the digital age. 
But more importantly, Bitcoin the payment system and technology for creating a backbone for the internet of money is extremely, extremely undervalued, as the innovative potential for developing with is has only just begun, and we are already nearing gold-level valuations "per unit" (I admit this is largely a psychological quanitification, however).

The perpetual butthurt from Kaminska is real. She just can't wrap her head around value and trust systems that self perpetuate without the need for a trusted third party, government or as she alludes to in her blog, "rulebook". 
We're breaking all the rules here, and necessarily grognards of the legacy financials will sooner go down with their ship than admit defeat. But that's ok. I've noticed that Kaminska has changed her tenor over the years whereas in the beginning she was of the mind that bitcoin clearly was absurd on its face and would never last.. "muh transactions per second", "muh electricity usage".. "muh it will never work" - to "muh blerkchain"... to obsessive cult junkies. Ad nauseam. 
God forbid she actual afford bitcoin and its blockchain the credit it deserves as a revolutionary invention and practical solution to trusted value transfer systems for people in areas affected by governments who insist on crushing any exchange that they do not explicitly approve of and tax. More specifically, systems that tax up to 20-30% of the value being transferred from an Indian worker in Dubai back home. And simply for the right to use that trusted third party to do so. These are impractical systems that need to be disrupted, and it is absolutely necessary that the proponents of such legacy systems have people such as Kaminska to advocate for them.

Except he's right and you're being as pedantic as that flowery-worded essay you just posted. Bitcoin is unlike anything Marx ever had the imagination to conceive, as it is literally nothing. 
Bitcoin is an idea, a completely ingenious and abstract concept:it's existence is intangible, its properties completely unlike anything we have ever known before as a species. 
Unlike gold, cash, or the atoms that comprise them, "posession" in bitcoin truly is nothing more than the *knowledge of* something, rather than the actual posession of it. You might as well declare "posession" of a random idea in your head, or "posession" of mathematics, as that is literally what we are encountering with bitcoin. 
Even "posession" itself- as in the literal meaning of the word, is abstract, as multiple people, indeed the entire world's population has the capability to derive "posession" of *any* bitcoin(s), so long as they have the *[starluck]( to guess the private key to unlock the ledger. There is no deconstruction, as there is, and never will be anything to deconstruct. You cannot apply "is" to what *is not*.

Even if your entire computer is stolen, as long as you have the Trezor and seed secured, you're ok. The sending of bitcoins from the Trezor requires a physical device keypress to actually initiate the transfer, as I understand it. Everything else is just monitoring balances and so forth. 
The bitcoins aren't on the device itself, as bitcoins don't actually exist. The ability to access your private keys is what is secured on the Trezor. And it is released through having the actual physical device in hand, to do so.

Ok, fine I'll entertain this. 
First off, I've bought far, far more bitcoin from Coinbase that you ever will. Second, none of the negative examples of their service have been shared in my experiences, none. And again, I use them quite often, both on Coinbase Pro and previously on their normal retail platform. And this isn't even bringing into account Coinbase Prime for their institutional investors.
Second, every single one of my ACH transfers has cleared my USAA checking account in 1-2 days. Yes, even using slow ass ACH those transfers are very timely given the legacy banking system. This shows me that they have their system down pat. And this isn't even taking into account wire transfers which you can elect to utilize if your overall purchase is over $25,000. Those wires clear the same day each and every time. There is a $25 fee but given my experience with other exchanges this is a small price to pay if you need to turn your corn into a house or a car immediately. 
So while their disclaimer says typically 3-5 for ACH, my experiences have been significantly faster but to be fair, these are limitations imposed by the banking system, not Coinbase. 
So forgive me if I interpret your OP as a subtle shill (I like how you took the time to embed the link blockchain.com out of the kindness of your heart) for an erstwhile new platform with nothing near the worldwide reach and experience as Coinbase. I wouldn't trust them (PIT) with a dime until they established a proven track record. (Just like any other exchange including Coinbase). Difference is, as a former MtGOX burned user, I resorted to Coinbase after that debacle and they have been extremely good to me since then.

Because it confounds him that something so radical in the world of finance is beyond his depth, technically. 
I mean that sounds hyperbolic but Bitcoin is a masterstroke in technology and a first of it's kind in human history, so the idea that he was not a pioneer in it or early on board forces him to double down. 
One of the first things I had to come to grips with (as with any radical new tech) is that there will always be smart people who completely disagree with you, and thats cool. I would not be as interested if there were no critics challenging Bitcoin every day. 
The fact that it has survived, and thrived in spite of an entire world of criticism, coupled with the full weight of the legacy financial system really speaks to it's toughness and viability.

What I do know is that Google and AT&amp;T manage to regularly harvest and monetize not only my private email conversations, but my *telephonic, spoken word* conversations as well. Now who knows who has access to this data, and what has been done with it. 
Further, how often has the US government abused FISA courts to obtain extrajudicial surveillance on just about anyone in the US because of a perpetual, Orwellian, "War on Terror"? A war for which there will *never* be an end, a perfect war, because it pertains to practically any act of malice that one could conceive of.

This is correct. People here don't grasp how big this will be for Bitcoin. How positively monumental this will be. Facebook is about to do our heavy lifting for us. 
Libra won't compete but it will teach and lay pavement for other, competing systems like Bitcoin. And by competing I don't mean in the way that Bitcoin is similar to Libra in any way, rather as it's use as a currency. 
If you understand OFAC and KYC you will know that no one using Libra will be able to send to countries or entities that are banned. And the more widespread this system gets, the more people will get banned and moderated. Bitcoin has NONE of that. Being centralized and controlled in its routing of payments, Libra will drive users into the open, waiting arms of open, decentralized, censorship and geopolitical control- resistant systems like Bitcoin.

Those are legitimate concerns, but it is a fallacy to assume the the Bitcoin network will remain forever stagnated at an arbitrary 1MB cap. 
The reason developers are keeping this in place revolves largely around plans to, in a responsible and well thought out manner, make Bitcoin a system for the ages. One that resists censorship and maintains decentralization above all things. While keeping it light and accessible to encourage worldwide [innovation without permission]( and avoid centralization tendencies. This base layer will become the backbone for layer 2 and 3 solutions which I believe, with more research and advancement, will revolutionize decentralized block chains and make scaling to Visa levels trivial. Just as what we saw happen with the early internet (which as you remember could never scale, could never evolve to 4K HD video streaming/facetime/Oculus rift VR capabilities) and Ethernet.

But this.. this is the opposite of that.
Further complicating things were a variety of broken agreements,like the Hong Kong agreement which also served as contentious points for many actors.

But your rational yet heartfelt expression of the fundamental problems that bitcoin is trying to solve (and your personal participation in it) is anything but zealotry. It represents a coming of age of sorts, a greater understanding of the systemic problems and solutions that we face in the financial world and how Bitcoin attempts to offer an alternative. 
From someone in a similar position, I say "thank you" to the devs as well, particularly for dodging this S2X bullet which would have been an utter disaster by the way.

The kind that you can send around the world instantly and be sure that the soundness of the asset (and scarcity) remain intact.

You have zero evidence that Coinbase is selling any kind of user data. 
But we *do* have [evidence of Coinbase actually challenging the IRS in court]( to NOT give them user data, in which Coinbase lost. 
So your solution to the problem of bitcoin purchasing and adoption (which has been hampered by scores of shoddy and scammy exchanges like MTGOX, Quadriga, Bitcoinica, et al) is to "AttackCoinbase"? Are you literally insane? 
You could conceivably purchase Bitcoin via Coinbase and tomorrow there would be a softfork with confidential transactions completely breaking Chainalysis' or Coinbase's methodology for tracking anything but the fiat you sent in to their platform. You do realize that, right? And yet you still call for the community to somehow materialize around your shoddy idea of fantasy ubiquitous surveillance. You just invented a problem and called for a community-wide solution that involves tearing down a system that works incredibly well for people who don't want to have to worry about Mark Karpeles walking away with their life savings. 
But you know how I really know you're a shill? Want to know my secret? Come here, real close, let me whisper this to you...


That's how I know. Any cypherpunk knows that Coinbase isn't Bitcoin. They know that Bitcoin is so much more powerful and transformative than to be threatened by one simple on-ramp. 
An yet, where are your impassioned pleas to "Attack JP Morgan" or "Attack Wells Fargo" or "Attack the US government accumulating 22 Trillion in debt, over$65,000.00 for every man woman and child"? Where are those attacks?
No, You pick Coinbase because either:
A.) You work for JP Morgan and you see their business model succeeding and you are threatened by it or
B.) You work for someone else and your job is to enter social media and instill doubt and arouse in-fighting in communities through disruption. 
Which is it?

True enough, but I do not recall any extensive peer review of any kind going on with this Segwit2X project, other than a bunch of guys got together in a smoky back room and decided for the community. Not to mention how rushed out the door it was. This leads me to believe that this all may have just been a ruse of some kind to temporarily placate the miners into accepting segwit... in anticipation of last-minute piecemeal withdrawals from the agreement over time. Which is precisely what is happening.

Because a mining cartel is spamming the mempool with 5 sat/b low fee transactions which automagically coincide with each and every attack of the last year and a half (Bitcoin Classic/Bitcoin XT/Bitcoin Unlimited/Bitcoin Cash)? 
I don't disagree with you about the copyright part, but to call Bitcoin cash a "better functioning alternative" is like calling a crack addict who can run a 3 minute mile and then immediately keel over dead a better athlete than a trained and healthy runner. 
Core is designing a small decentralized base layer as it represents engineering superiority and patience. Long term viability for second layer solutions which are not always economically pleasing to certain businesses who jumped into Bitcoin expecting low fees in perpetuity, without truly caring about the long term health of the underlying system needed to maintain those lower fees. Those same businesses who now advocate blockchain heroin in the form of bigger blocks, for a "give it all to me now, the future be damed" solution. 
So, "at the moment" is quite the fleeting concept, but you probably already knew this as a "principled investor".

Ver would get a lot richer in fiat or bcash, but would lose immense leverage in the bitcoin space through something like this. I truly hope he does sell. I and many others would snap up those coins quite readily.

Ergo, this isn't designed to protect consumers, it's designed to squash innovation and protect incumbents in the legacy financial sector.

From the [Coindesk]( article today, just because it was so fucking *savage*...








All this holds true doubly, triply (if not more) so for any government or state actor. 
If the Bitcoin community is in such an uproar over (an upgrade! depending on your opinion) this simple blocksize increase, *just imagine* the force of the entire community, united against a state actor. 
Governments need to be very careful with consensus peer to peer systems like these, anyway. Bitcoin is a very docile varietal. Lest they step on it and cause it to replicate in a variety of much more stealthy, pernicious ways. The nuclear gecko indeed...

This is bad for crypto exchanges, not Bitcoin. Learn the difference. 
Crypto exchanges DO need regulation and oversight, as they are necessary on ramps for conversion back and forth. 
Yes, you can always retain custody of your own bitcoins, that's the whole point. But for those who trade, or cannot reliably store their own bitcoins on a Trezor, etc., things like these are where you will find those bitcoins residing. And these exchanges need work. A lot of work. 
Coinbase is the clear leader here, in my view.

The blockchain technology is what gives it value. Wish they could see that the token is an inherent part of securing and decentralizing the blockchain tech. So in a roundabout way, the blockchain makes bitcoin very useful as a currency in many cases, just ask a Greek whose accounts are now frozen. 
Unlike fiat currency where the full faith is placed in the lap of a central bank which is subject to the whims of the state. In my case  (the US), a state which has $122 trillion in unfunded liabilities to deal with at some point.

Her thesis is predicated on the flawed concept that *layer 2 solutions will never exist*, and that bitcoin is unupgradeable. 
One of the most difficult things for "prognosticators" to surmise is the ability of bitcoin to serve as programmable money, and as such it is subject to *upgrades* at any given time, which inherently can be transformative.

Awesome. Keepkey, Trezor, Casewallet, Ledger, the promises of last year regarding evolution of hardware wallets is really coming to fruition. 
And we haven't even really started with the hardware environment options within smartphones yet. As far as I'm concerned, thats where this stuff needs to go. Isolated hardware layers within smartphones that allow this kind of security on a device that everyone already has on them anyway.

Not sure what the fear of a Trezor breaking is. 
Most hardware wallets provide you with a 12 (or more) word recovery seed so you can recover your wallet practically anywhere these days. 
But yes, if you lose the recovery phrase and break the hardware wallet you are probably screwed.

This looks like a problem with your bank. I've never seen such times for transfers, and wires out of Coinbase Pro deposit on the same day.

@_date: 2019-12-01 04:16:06
They are considered to be the bellwether in crypto trading platforms. Deposits are insured. You can elect to use their various additional security options like address whitelisting, 2 factor authentication, withdrawal cool downs (provides set time to cancel a withdrawal of you did not authorize it), etc.
I highly recommend both Coinbase and Gemeni for serious traders and even holders. I would consider their storage solution to be slightly below a hardware wallet however.

So wrong. If the lessons of Cryprus, Greece and a possible (even still) Grexit have been learned they are that governments can and WILL adopt bail-ins (bank account confiscation to include safety deposit boxes) as means of last resort, and "wealth" has devolved into nothing more than government chits, subject to the whims of the banking establishment. 
It is precisely that theft of power, the usurpation of the collective populace's value system (money) that has and will continue to have bitcoin grow in popularity and appeal. This anonymity and divorce from state control requires the use of the bitcoin token, the valued atomic unit of trust that powers the bitcoin blockchain. 
Look at Uber, Airbnb, Lyft, and all other manner of trends towards decentralization. The power base of central goverment and central bank control is slipping and people (particularly now in China) are losing faith in this shallow veil of omnipotence. 
It is precisely these kinds of trends that bitcoin leverages in its rise to mainstream appeal. Any *permissioned* ledger system, be it Eris, Hyperledger, Ripple, etc, has some central point of failure in that someone, somewhere, still has ultimate power to shut them down and kill wealth and innovation. Unfortunately, that "someone" might hold moral or political views radically different than your own. 
Bitcoin has no such reliance on central control. It just *is*. And that is much, much closer to what humans *really* are questing for... truth. Be it in finance or anything else. Truth and neutrality. This is why bitcoin is a powerful financial tool unlike any other.

Hence, Bitcoin, a 21st century approach to storing and controlling the value of your work in a global, exchangeable format that NO government controls, or can control.

Because the idea, the very notion that people are expending energy at the bidding of [large banks whose main goal is to screw you over in each and every way possible]( while the technology of bitcoin exists is absolutely reprehensible. 
You don't seem to understand that banks, and their lackeys like Tim Swanson et al, don't really care about your financial freedom, bail-ins, global innovation etc. They care about efficient internal accounting, and to many bitcoiners, this idea is an absolute bastardization of the blockchain's original premise: open and math-based financial freedom/transparency.
I don't disagree with you that some banks and large financial institutions are interested in these permissioned ledger ideas. In fact, I expect them to be merely because of their controlled, opaque nature. However, the point that Andreas is so eloquently making speaks to me in the sense that we have been gifted a better, more transparent and global way of accomplishing many of the same tasks. A method which allows these institutions' customers to have full accounting of their funds and the banks' internal records. Of course banks don't want this. Why? Because again, they aren't you ally. Yet they want *full*control over your money. They want more efficient ways to bastardize this technology to ensure that you continue to be without full control of your money. You're OK with this??

They are not fundamentally useless. They are, in fact very useful in preventing botnets and clusters of random computing to be used to attack the bitcoin network. Currently, due to this type of specific computing, it would take massive investments in ASIC fabrication to even begin to attempt attacks which would be immediately noticed on the network. 
For all the reasons listed in the article as to why the blockchain is "good" and useful, the computational proof of work mechanism is validated, because the two are inexorably linked through the creation of bitcoins in mining. 
Its getting to be a bit intellectually dishonest for so many journalists to jump on the bandwagon of "bitcoin bad blockchain good" without concrete ideas or concepts as to how to actually make it better or present even the beginning of a coherent thought as to how it is going to be replaced. And no, simply [namedropping Ethereum]( does not grant one glitterati status in the space by default. 
As for people losing keys, "losing" is an ephemeral idea, and even so, this presents no problem, as unaccessible bitcoins simply raises the value of everyone elses. This is a digital cash system, after all.

It just clicks in your mind. It's like Neo seeing the matrix for the first time. You see a world of effortlessly flowing money and machines interacting at the speed of innovation. Simple clicks of a web button to send money with no confirmations and intermediaries.

You don't seem to fully understand how the tax system works; it's voluntary up to a point. You pay what you say you owe, and if they dispute that then you get audited and it gets resolved. But saying that Bitcoin is an enabler of tax evasion is like saying free speech is an enabler of libel or perjury. 
Governments should not ban everything in their way that might present a problem. This stifles innovation and kills thought and free enterprise. It's fucking tyrannical. 
What governments *ought* to do is promote innovation and enforce the law as it stands, which Bitcoin is perfectly suited for with it's completely transparent ledger.

This is normal. Most wallets these days do the same thing, in that they generate new addresses every time you deposit to them. This is one of the privacy functions of bitcoin known as "HD wallets". 
The main thing you want to do here is scrutinize the address on your sending wallet to double check that it is correct before sending your bitcoin. There have been viruses in the past that change addresses when you copy - paste, hoping to snare people who do not look at the entire address before sending.

Of course, the next logical step would be doing away with the third party, and accepting bitcoin directly. Patience.

I don't necessarily posit that you're all in favor of banks and their methods. So please do not misunderstand that I am lumping you in categorically with a broad stroke of ignorance and offhandedness. 
However, I did question you about a few things as I mainly see certain financial institutions immediately recognize bitcoin's ability to disrupt certain (not all) aspects of their core business. When you extrapolate the technology many years down the line, it doesn't take a tremendous leap of faith to assume that all manner of incredibly disruptive and radical new fintech innovations will arise in this space specifically due to the open, not closed nature of bitcoin. 
I simply see bitcoin as an enormous enabler of this kind of innovation. I see closed ledgers as a way to bastardize the blockchain idea into a closed walled garden the likes of which Apple, inc. would probably drool all over. The itunes of finance, it you will. This is reprehensible to me in many ways because this mentality is that of a usurper, in which the banking industry would likely view any disruption as a threat and address it ferociously. That offends me. Anything that closes me off from the value of my work offends me. I store a shitload of work in the fiat notes that reside, digitally, in ledger my bank keeps. I'd much rather that be open, and transparent than closed off, subject to a kill switch that the bank itself controls. This, in my view, is the highly dystopic end-game of closed ledgers. Control, power, and ultimatly, abuse. Not because the ledgers themselves, promote this, rather, that the ledgers' protocols still endow trust with certain high-level actors whose politics, morality, notions of control, etc., may differ from mine. 
I also agree that we need to have a reasoned, yet impassioned debate on these technologies, and that we should welcome dissent and argument. I am not trying to shut you down, rather, I am relatively passionate about fostering technologies which can promote innovation and human evolution globally, as well as locally. Inclusivity in a financial sense, the likes of which bitcoin readily can (and does) enable rather than reverting back to some iteration of the blockchain tech that is ultimately another method of financial repression and an extention of state control. 
Remember Nic Cary's [quote]( (blockchain.info)? 
He was at the bitcoin world conference in Vegas in '14 sitting behind several credit union high level execs and CEOs and they said, "These guys don't know the true meaning of the word evil till we fuck them". True or not, when I look at the [biggest bank settlements]( and I see a closed off, sometimes criminal oligarchy that is ripe for disruption. I'm just arguing for, not against technologies that encourage this kind of change.

I'm not really sure what significant benefits this provides over the trezor version one.
What problems were they trying to solve for this version?
Why didn't the address some of the glaring problems with the first version here? For example a secure environment like the ledger S has for securing the keys. Or, a harder more durable case.
I do like the fact that they're using USB type-c. Because sitting that micro USB into the bottom of the trezor was a bit of a pain in the ass.

Bingo; you've just described the Keynesian nightmare. They fear precisely what you are describing here more than anything else. 
It's all about the velocity of money, the flows. If the flows slow down into the traditional banking sector, liquidity dries up and bagholders for the larger institutions go away. They can't have this. No, not at all.. they need a greater fool. 
In their eyes, the saver, the sound money believer, the holder, the prudent spender, is the root of all evil. If you are wise and risk averse, they hate you. They want to prey on your "animal insticts" to inject liquidity into risky equities so they can fleece you via frontloaded HFT. And when I say "you" I don't mean you personally, rather the greater public, or "mom and pop" investor. 
Problem is for the big banks, the baby boomer generation, the traditional "mom and pop" are going away rapidly. Millenials want no part of this debacle, nor do they have the financial means to participate anyway. Gone are the days of desire for the biggest and best in America; today is the day of "cars as an app". Your 2016 Honda Fit is just as acceptable and attractive as a Camaro back in the day, to these kids. And a hell of a lot more durable and reliable. A car is just another gadget, just a tool to enrich their social lives, and that is all they care about.. not the *stuff* that we, as boomers and Gen X'ers have been raised to expect. 
More stuff, more material goods more everything. But not anymore, and that is going to be the root cause of this next financial meltdown. It isn't a glut of oil and "China". It's a growing dependency on the government and decreased demand due to structural changes in our very global culture. 
Bankers are going to have to deal with it. Still, I see the forthcoming financial singularity on the horizon, and it ain't pretty, Lois.

Originally posted Op-Ed via The Wall Street Journal,
These are strange monetary times, with negative interest rates and central bankers deemed to be masters of the universe. So maybe we shouldn’t be surprised that politicians and central bankers are now waging a war on cash. That’s right, policy makers in Europe and the U.S. want to make it harder for the hoi polloi to hold actual currency.
Mario Draghi fired the latest salvo on Monday when he said the European Central Bank would like to ban €500 notes. A day later Harvard economist and Democratic Party favorite Larry Summers declared that it’s time to kill the $100 bill, which would mean goodbye to Ben Franklin. Alexander Hamilton may soon—and shamefully—be replaced on the $10 bill, but at least the 10-spots would exist for a while longer. Ol’ Ben would be banished from the currency the way dead white males like him are banned from the history books.
Limits on cash transactions have been spreading in Europe since the 2008 financial panic, ostensibly to crack down on crime and tax avoidance. Italy has made it illegal to pay cash for anything worth more than €1,000 ($1,116), while France cut its limit to €1,000 from €3,000 last year. British merchants accepting more than €15,000 in cash per transaction must first register with the tax authorities. Fines for violators can run into the thousands of euros. Germany’s Deputy Finance Minister Michael Meister recently proposed a €5,000 cap on cash transactions. Deutsche Bank CEO John Cryan predicted last month that cash won’t survive another decade.
The enemies of cash claim that only crooks and cranks need large-denomination bills. They want large transactions to be made electronically so government can follow them. Yet these are some of the same European politicians who blew a gasket when they learned that U.S. counterterrorist officials were monitoring money through the Swift global system. Criminals will find a way, large bills or not.
The real reason the war on cash is gearing up now is political: Politicians and central bankers fear that holders of currency could undermine their brave new monetary world of negative interest rates. Japan and Europe are already deep into negative territory, and U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said last week the U.S. should be prepared for the possibility. Translation: That’s where the Fed is going in the next recession.
Negative rates are a tax on deposits with banks, with the goal of prodding depositors to remove their cash and spend it to increase economic demand. But that goal will be undermined if citizens hoard cash. And hoarding cash is easier if you can take your deposits out in large-denomination bills you can stick in a safe. It’s harder to keep cash if you can only hold small bills.
So, presto, ban cash. This theme has been pushed by the likes of Bank of England chief economist Andrew Haldane and Harvard’s Kenneth Rogoff, who wrote in the Financial Times that eliminating paper currency would be “by far the simplest” way to “get around” the zero interest-rate bound “that has handcuffed central banks since the financial crisis.” If the benighted peasants won’t spend on their own, well, make it that much harder for them to save money even in their own mattresses.
All of which ignores the virtues of cash for law-abiding citizens. Cash allows legitimate transactions to be executed quickly, without either party paying fees to a bank or credit-card processor. Cash also lets millions of low-income people participate in the economy without maintaining a bank account, the costs of which are mounting as post-2008 regulations drop the ax on fee-free retail banking. While there’s always a risk of being mugged on the way to the store, digital transactions are subject to hacking and computer theft.
Cash is also the currency of gray markets—amounting to 20% or more of gross domestic product in some European countries—that governments would love to tax. But the reason gray markets exist is because high taxes and regulatory costs drive otherwise honest businesses off the books. Politicians may want to think twice about cracking down on the cash economy in a way that might destroy businesses and add millions to the jobless rolls. The Italian economy might shut down without cash.
By all means people should be able to go cashless if they like. But it’s hard to avoid the conclusion that the politicians want to bar cash as one more infringement on economic liberty. They may go after the big bills now, but does anyone think they’d stop there? Why wouldn’t they eventually ban all cash transactions much as they banned gold and silver as mediums of exchange?
Beware politicians trying to limit the ways you can conduct private economic business. It never turns out well.

The Trezor integrates perfectly with Mycelium in that you can view the wallet in your mycelium accounts and even spend from it when you plug in the Teezor itself in order to sign the transaction. 
Additionally, the mytrezor.com web wallet extension does the same thing except on your browser based wallet.

Yes, you do need to wait. This, "move fast and break things" with "obvious benefits" might work in the ETH community, but this is a serious situation with a serious financial tool at stake here. Recall that those "obvious benefits in Ethereum caused them to have to hard fork their disastrous implementations 4 times... This ridiculous guy throwing around hard fork ideas left and right while COMPLETELY disregarding the will of the bitcoin economy/users/wallets is utterly reprehensible. 
This is like being a fly on the wall of JP Morgan taking out a hit on a smaller bank in the 30's. Reeks of manipulation and attempted monopoly/control.

"These are strange monetary times, with negative interest rates and central bankers deemed to be masters of the universe. So maybe we shouldn’t be surprised that politicians and central bankers are now waging a war on cash. That’s right, policy makers in Europe and the U.S. want to make it harder for the hoi polloi to hold actual currency.
Mario Draghi fired the latest salvo on Monday when he said the European Central Bank would like to ban €500 notes. A day later Harvard economist and Democratic Party favorite Larry Summers declared that it’s time to kill the $100 bill, which would mean goodbye to Ben Franklin. Alexander Hamilton may soon—and shamefully—be replaced on the $10 bill, but at least the 10-spots would exist for a while longer. Ol’ Ben would be banished from the currency the way dead white males like him are banned from the history books.
Limits on cash transactions have been spreading in Europe since the 2008 financial panic, ostensibly to crack down on crime and tax avoidance. Italy has made it illegal to pay cash for anything worth more than €1,000 ($1,116), while France cut its limit to €1,000 from €3,000 last year. British merchants accepting more than €15,000 in cash per transaction must first register with the tax authorities. Fines for violators can run into the thousands of euros. Germany’s Deputy Finance Minister Michael Meister recently proposed a €5,000 cap on cash transactions. Deutsche Bank CEO John Cryan predicted last month that cash won’t survive another decade.
The enemies of cash claim that only crooks and cranks need large-denomination bills. They want large transactions to be made electronically so government can follow them. Yet these are some of the same European politicians who blew a gasket when they learned that U.S. counterterrorist officials were monitoring money through the Swift global system. Criminals will find a way, large bills or not.
The real reason the war on cash is gearing up now is political: Politicians and central bankers fear that holders of currency could undermine their brave new monetary world of negative interest rates. Japan and Europe are already deep into negative territory, and U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said last week the U.S. should be prepared for the possibility. Translation: That’s where the Fed is going in the next recession.
Negative rates are a tax on deposits with banks, with the goal of prodding depositors to remove their cash and spend it to increase economic demand. But that goal will be undermined if citizens hoard cash. And hoarding cash is easier if you can take your deposits out in large-denomination bills you can stick in a safe. It’s harder to keep cash if you can only hold small bills.
So, presto, ban cash. This theme has been pushed by the likes of Bank of England chief economist Andrew Haldane and Harvard’s Kenneth Rogoff, who wrote in the Financial Times that eliminating paper currency would be “by far the simplest” way to “get around” the zero interest-rate bound “that has handcuffed central banks since the financial crisis.” If the benighted peasants won’t spend on their own, well, make it that much harder for them to save money even in their own mattresses.
All of which ignores the virtues of cash for law-abiding citizens. Cash allows legitimate transactions to be executed quickly, without either party paying fees to a bank or credit-card processor. Cash also lets millions of low-income people participate in the economy without maintaining a bank account, the costs of which are mounting as post-2008 regulations drop the ax on fee-free retail banking. While there’s always a risk of being mugged on the way to the store, digital transactions are subject to hacking and computer theft.
Cash is also the currency of gray markets—amounting to 20% or more of gross domestic product in some European countries—that governments would love to tax. But the reason gray markets exist is because high taxes and regulatory costs drive otherwise honest businesses off the books. Politicians may want to think twice about cracking down on the cash economy in a way that might destroy businesses and add millions to the jobless rolls. The Italian economy might shut down without cash.
By all means people should be able to go cashless if they like. But it’s hard to avoid the conclusion that the politicians want to bar cash as one more infringement on economic liberty. They may go after the big bills now, but does anyone think they’d stop there? Why wouldn’t they eventually ban all cash transactions much as they banned gold and silver as mediums of exchange?
Beware politicians trying to limit the ways you can conduct private economic business. It never turns out well."

The regulatory system is predicated on the use of government scrip (either converting to, or from). You use their tools, you play by their rules. 
Bitcoin presents no such quandary. If you desire to exercise your legitimate right as a human to place the value of a week's worth of hard work into a form of value that you choose, well, that is ultimately a sovereign human right. If you cannot make this fundamental choice, well, then let's just admit it.. you are a slave, essentially, to a particular system. 
So if it is seashells, furs, gold, bitcoin, whatever, if you desire to transact with it, you ought to be able to do so. Regulatory oversight should, and would, in that case, come into view in terms of how much tax you now owe, payable (after the fact, at tax time) in government fiat. 
Or, are they perhaps insinuating that bitcoin may be considered valid for the payment of all debts, public and private?

Does this mean that China is effectively trying to out all independent Bitcoin miners in the country? What effect will this have on the mining industry? 
You might even go so far as to guess that this is intended to be somewhat protective. The fees of a few thousand yuan are not enough to be severely restrictive to certain existing miners, while they certainly will be restrictive to anyone considering entering the space or a fledgling startup. 
So in a way this could actually protect certain businesses who already have an "in" with certain circles. I could see these regulations actually setting the stage for something else.

With Bitcoin NOTHING major happens without massive community and technical oversight, (as we saw with UASF/BIP 148) which has really shown me in practice how difficult it can be to change even a small part of Bitcoin. This is a feature, and should be embraced.

So in the "eyes of the people" Bitcoin exposes the grand charade both in it's mathematical precision and soundness, and in it's function as a great educator as to what actually makes money work. People tend to learn about that when they use bitcoin, so it can never be legitimized.

Zero. It'll never happen. 
To do so would risk the very premise of the central bank itself, in the eyes of the people. They'd sooner print &amp; inflate because it's effectively free for them and the people are the only ones to lose.
If Central Banks are collapsing to the point where they are considering alternative crypto assets we'd sooner see a third world war.
What you instinctively fail to realize is that for bankers like Jamie Dimon and Bernanke it is far easier to gamble with the lives of US servicemen and women than their own business model. And much more lucrative.
Keep dreaming, though.

I don't think Vorhees and Silbert were trying to be hostile to Bitcoin through their support of a compromise solution (and it was called S2X, by the way not B2X). These guys are Bitcoin true believers, from everything I've heard out of them. 
I just think they were duped by the onlslaught of concern trolling from the likes of Ver and Wu helped immensely by ETH trolls and any others looking to incite FUD into the Bitcoin arena. 
So they opted for what most reasonable, but perhaps uninformed people might do, and went with what they felt was a compromise. I don't necessarily fault them for giving in to the pressure. 
The issue now is, let's resolve differences and move forward together. Hindsight is 20/20 and it is very unfair for people to look at the situation now and proclaim how right or wrong people were/are. Things were very chaotic back at that time, and it was easy to think fall into the trap that Ver was setting stating that mainstream adoption was at hand and fees would continue to rise (they were upwards of $20+ per transaction!)
Let's get this behind us and move forward instead of acting all high and mighty, eh?

So let's blacklist coins *for* the governments, because we fear that they might eventually ban bitcoin anyway? You're sounding like a gov employee, guy. Or a shill. That's the last thing we want to do. 
No, this isn't a problem at all, and NO, we don't need to face anything. Bitcoin is working exactly as intended, and while the parts of an image making up a complete file are distributed through hundreds if not thousands of individual bitcoin transactions, the crime is taking that data and compiling it into a file that is visible in the form of a jpeg. *That's* the crime. That's your criminal, so go after that person, not the ledger that stored indiscriminate bits of data. 
And hey, while you're at it, ban the internet as a whole, because guess what, *all* of that child porn data existed and was transferred through data servers using the internet.

Pretty blatantly negative press for bitcoin. But what the NYT fails to realize despite their flailing about and gnashing of teeth over such important topics as "wasted potential for energy usage" and "underemployed millenials" of all things, is that bitcoin simply doesn't give a shit. 
Look. People strongly oppose bitcoin. I get it. But they have been doing so, everyone has been doing so since its inception. It will fail. It has failed. Bitcoin is a joke. And yet, it continues to exist, in fact, it is thriving and even expanding. Week over week, year over year. 
They fail to realize that it has embedded itself, like a virus, into our failing system, and by using simple principles like scarcity, sound money, and a mining system driven by pure free market competition, and has proven itself to be a force to be reckoned with. 
So I very much look forward to the next phase of journalism where the narrative will inevitably *shift* to something actually fearful. *What now, do we actually DO about Bitcoin*? And yet at that point, it will have been far, far too late.

As it stands right now, an initial complete block chain sync for a new node install can take a week or even 2. 
He's illustrating that this is just a poor way to approach a scaling solution that should be more nuanced and based on actual technical trends rather than brute forcing the scaling at the potential cost of leaving behind those who either don't have the time or patience or HD space/Bandwidth to accommodate huge blocks. 
I could understand the concern if layer 2 solutions like Lightning Network were centralized, traceable or cumbersome to use, but they are quite the opposite. Pretty much completely confidential and very fast to set up and run even today (and we aren't even out of the starting gate yet- it's still in beta). 
So in my eyes the way that Bitcoin has gone completely blows the big block approach out of the water. It has become readily apparent that the entire Bitcoin Cash/big block scheme was a Roger Ver inspired attempt to lever control in the Bitcoin space through disinformation and politics rather than actual technical merit. 
And yes, I run a Lightning and Bitcoin full node, and trust me when I say Lightning is awesome.

This, to me is one of the most amusing arguments put forth by casual users of bitcoin who know little to nothing about it. 
Bitcoin is, by nature, a protocol which enables a programmable feature set that is ever-changing. To say that bitcoin is one thing, or another is nonsense. 
The correct answer is we don't actually know what bitcoin will be or what it can become, because it evolves. It is programmed in different ways to upgrade, become more useful, change. It is not static, as you are alluding. 
So in that regard bitcoin can, and will, evolve to absorb the properties and characteristics of this and that, but it's most important characteristics, the ones that set it apart from all those disparate altcoins you refer to are: 21 million coin limit. Immutability. Decentralized. All the rest is up for negotiation. 
So please don't spread this rumor that bitcoin IS this or that. It isn't. No one knows what it is because it is being built before our eyes, and innovates without permission. 
Difficult concepts for people like Dimon to grasp mentally. And I say that because he has yet to formulate an actual coherent argument as to precisely why Bitcoin is so terrible and bad.

What I've gathered is essentially this:
Bitcoin was originally intended to be an "electronic cash system" for daily use, by the people. This philosophy typically is cited as Satoshi's vision (TM) for Bitcoin, referencing the White Paper, and contextual quotes from Bitcoin's development in the early years. 
By keeping Bitcoin "pure" and on-chain, miners are incentivized to compete for fees, which will rise concordant with the increase in volume of the expected (assumed) mainstream adoption by the masses. 
As this adoption takes place as the result of common user interaction, ever more participation is anticipated through network effect and enhancements in wallet and exchange technology, further closing the loop and driving adoption even faster. 
As this all takes place, increased congestion in the mempool- which is subject to a 1MB block size, occurs. This necessitates the need for an increase to the block size. This increase can be limited and shaped by market driven forces which will hypothetically drive the rate of increase (or decrease as with Bitcoin Unlimited) into economic equilibrium with existing limitations in the internet bandwidth and storage requirements to run a node and participate in Bitcoin. 
Failing these critical scaling enhancements, Bitcoin will suffer and ultimately die much the same as Myspace in comparison to Facebook and other nimbler, more innovative market participants (altcoins). This can be evidenced by looking at the tendency for the mempool to fill up and choke the throughput of Bitcoin during periods of increased use, which has driven up the use and market price of various competing altcoins. 
If Bitcoin does not rapidly accommodate this influx of new users it will surely wither and die in the face of competition. 
We must *act now* to prevent the stagnation and death of Bitcoin, and prevent a small cabal of developers operating behind closed doors, and who are subject to unseen corporate motives, from usurping and controlling the direction of Bitcoin at this most critical time. 
If these developers, who operate with solely in the interest of greed and the will their corporate masters, is allowed to continue, we risk forcing much of the central premise of Bitcoin off-chain. This shift will disincentivize miners due to the decrease in fees received from the lessened transaction quantity, stemming from "layer 2" off chain corporate controlled solutions. 
These off chain solutions will ultimately decrease decentralization and drive Bitcoin into the realm of gated on ramps subject to the tyranny of AML/KYC. This will eventually destroy Bitcoin, or at the very least, turn it into  some hybrid government coin subject to regulation.
We must act now to prevent Bitcoin from being outpaced even if this means sacrificing some aspects of decentralization and accessibility. We must scale this system to accommodate more users at once. 
-This is my very basic understanding of *some* of the arguments put out there. Having said that, I think they are wrong, but I won't go into that here, not enough time. This is just my layman's interpretation of what has been put out there, and I have probably butchered some of it.

Welcome, concern troll! 
But still:


It isn't the increase in blocksize that people here are objecting with. I think you'll find the vast majority agree that at some point a block size increase will become necessary. I think that main issue many are objecting to is the back room nature of the deal made out of the light of public view, and the rushed, sloppy nature of the code being pushed out. It is tremendously immature and capricious to throw this huge change to bitcoin out so fast and without rigorous testing and criticism. Contentious hard forks MUST be avoided at all costs. 
Not only does this particular hard fork NOT try to avoid it, it actually *rushes* it out by means of a tiny, tiny dev team bereft of community and expert critic and review, and is funded by a cartel of Chinese miners and big companies with interest in co opting bitcoin to their corporate purpose. 
On a side note, you'll see that many subversive alt coin supporters such as yourself deeply support this break, as it tends to make their shitcoins look more appealing to casual passers by who know little to nothing about the big picture. GG

Just Luke doing Luke things, as per usual.
Ancaps make me lol. They don't have guts. See, bitcoin was *designed* to respond to internal threats through game theory and market driven forces. 
Bitmain threat goes up, decentralization goes down, community agitation goes up, consumer sentiment goes down. And then the price tanks.
When the price actually does tank, and the system responds as it should, huge incentives appear for competitive solutions through direct cause and effect actions. Don't you think Samsung would snap up the chance to establish mining parity with bitmain? 
Let the system work itself out through market driven forces. Rely on the systems that made bitcoin what it is today in the first place.

People betting on the price to go down have been destroyed for as long as shorting has existed in Bitcoin. Historically, he's dead wrong, and you have charts to back that up. 
Bitcoin's liquidity pool has been and is still relatively tiny. With each passing year volatility decreases.

It doesn't work like that. Consensus is *designed* to be hard to achieve, for the very purpose of defeating change, because at it's core Bitcoin just works fine, and has been working fine without a single successful attack on the core protocol since its inception. So by making changes hard, we preserve that base layer, and demand upgrades that unanimously benefit all economic participants. This is how the game theory of Bitcoin works. It ain't a dictatorship.

Segwit2x was a kludge to placate the miners due to the ferocious onslaught of the UASF. So we won that war. Why do we still need S2X, then?
The answer is: we don't. So here's what we need to do. Provide these companies with concrete proof that scaling via block size is not the way to go and that Lightning can solve some of these problems in the near to medium term. This demonstration of Lightning's capabilities in a real-to-life or beta state can give these companies the plausible deniability they need to BACK OUT of the NYA and go on about their business in confidence that scaling will be addressed. 
In absence of concrete solutions to scaling, you can't blame people for wanting to usurp and control bitcoin. It's just too big an apple to not pluck from the tree. No amount of Redditposting will change these business decisions. This is about money, not words now.

Bitcoin isn't "backed" by a central authority. 
It is this fact that actually gives it incredible value and usefulness, so let's talk about that for a moment. 
Fiat currencies derive value from the fact that governments demand that citizens accept them for payment and for tax, i.e., legal tender for all debts, public and private. 
Bitcoin has no such mandate. It derives it value from that fact that it survives, and has survived. Every day that bitcoin *doesn't die* redeems it, and through censorship resistance and decentralization, (and a host of other technological wizardry) proves that it is capable of functioning as money. 
Bitcoin has value because people, not governments have decided to use it. Bitcoin is *useful* and in use, no matter what anyone says. Bitcoin *is solving* problems for people today, right now, as we speak. You must rid yourself of this conventional wisdom that states that value derives from a central power, or some random governmental body. Yes, that is how many of our conventional systems work, but this is not a hard and fast rule for all humanity. We can innovate and invent outside of the realm of government when it comes to money now. 
And that's what we did.

Perhaps someone should inform him that Bitcoin is programmable financial network that allows innovation without permission. That engine serves as a tremendous gateway to the world's unbanked and underbanked. Not to mention the fact that it allows anyone with internet access and a PC to gain the same kind of cryptographic security for their new apps/inventions that banks have. 
I think these kinds of concepts are lost on Buffett, who is a fabulous investor for his time. But the times they are a certainly changin'...

I would have no problem bumping the block size provided that there was a pressing, demonstrated need for it. If developers, miners, and community all tended to agree that this was a necessarily important upgrade then absolutely. 
But this rushed out, back room kludge they are calling S2X, well, no. 


Miners are turning a nice profit and will make any flippant change to the protocol, sacrificing the golden egg, just so long as it makes them more money. They do not act with ideological or political concerns, imo. They have a business to run, and that mentality can quickly turn bitcoin into something dark. If bitcoin fails, no problem, they can then just point their miners elsewhere in the undying search for alpha.

2.) The government itself never truly promoted freedom and thus deserves no respect in the first place.

Creating nonsensical regulation for bitcoin and the like is absurd on its face.
Look. Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology is the genie that has left the bottle. It's too late to stop it now. 
By stomping on bitcoin (assuming they could even do such a thing) they would unwittingly spur the creation of stealthier and more problematic versions that can evade regulation as simply as a software upgrade. So to say that they should stomp on bitcoin can be a double edged sword for regulators, and they should proceed with extreme caution before jumping on the "muh bitcoin currency for drug dealers hurr durr" bandwagon that seems to be so en vogue these days. 
Take a listen to this highly enlightening comment from Coinsummit in 2014:
How about truly understand the technology and engage the community before popping off with wanton regulation. Although somewhere, I can see Dimon rubbing his hands together with glee. Problem is, this kind of regulation would stifle innovation and cut the US off from one of the most exciting technological revolutions in mankind's history. Literally.

I always thought this project was really cool. Interesting to see them move forward with it. Now I'd love to see them disrupt LinkedIn with this professional certification system because as it stands right now the listing of credentials on that site are basically just some made up bullshit. 
One thing I think they need to be careful with is specifying *which* blockchain they are using, because the article mentions bitcoin, but their site interchangeably uses "a blockchain" which is literally akin to saying your professional credentials are verified with the technology of a doge meme, which today, could literally be the case. The credential is only as good as the source of truth securing it.

Consensus in Bitcoin is an extremely difficult thing to achieve. The only reason S2X has gotten even this far is UASF, and the panic it caused. Which in turn spurred a cabal of big Bitcoin businesses and some miners to "signal" support. But even all of that is non binding. 
At the end of the day, the broader Bitcoin space acts as a buffer against these things through its sheer inefficiency of leadership. In fact, this is by design, as protocol changes and hard forks *should be* so overwhelmingly viable and beneficial that the massive majority accepts them. Anything less than massive consensus typically gets rejected out of hand, because so many players have direct financial incentives to not disrupt the system, and to play it safe. 
UASF just kicked everyone in the ass into action. It was beautiful. This shook the bushes and rushed this S2X stuff out way too fast and now it will be shot down in due order.

What is truth? 
The blockchain makes transactions true, for most humans. 
And associating credentials with transactions is just a matter of mechanics and the arbiter used to verify that transaction. 
If MIT is in this case, is the ultimate arbiter of truth when it comes to verifying the authenticity of a diploma, then their private key signifies a uniqueness to the diploma it was associated with. 
The bitcoin blockchain maintains the uniqueness better than any other database in the same way it does so for transactions. So for their purposes, the blockchain serves as a serialization system that really makes sense for verifying things compared to how we do it currently. 
Why trust a courthouse or a magistrate or notary when you can trust that transactions are valid. The only way for this not to be the case is if bitcoin transactions themselves are declared invalid...

This is a graphical depiction of the current state of the [lightning network]( a scaling solution for bitcoin (and other coins that support it) enabling near instant and incredibly cheap transactions which occur on a layer built on top of the bitcoin blockchain. Meaning, they eventually settle back to the main chain but retain the same security concepts as bitcoin without the 10 minute confirmation times. 
This graphic shows how rapidly the fledgling network has grown in such a short time, and frankly it is quite breathtaking to watch the birth of a financial network in real time. 
I would think many economists would be fascinated by this but I do believe that many of them have simply dug in their heels and put their heads in the sand insisting that the current way of doing things cannot be disrupted (they would be wrong).

@_date: 2018-02-20 17:59:21
What? How? NO!
Immutability is an artifact of proof of work, NOT BLOCKCHAINS.  
"Blockchain" as a technology, or word, is more of a meme these days. People spout it off like it actually means something incredibly innovative and cool. But in all actuality, every blockchain out there is potentially mutable and corruptible. Look at ETH and the DAO. And that is the second largest crypto by marketcap, and surely one of the most popular. And it hardforked due to a critical software mistake. 
Now non-public, governmental, and closed "blockchains" are not, inherently these God-like uncorruptible glyphs. They are inherently still under the control of a central party, and as such, no different than an ehanced database that is just waiting for a court order or judicial process to alter or expose. 
The magic behind bitcoin's blockchain is that it is opem , public, fundamentally neutral to ALL parties, and secured by the most massive amount of computing power on the planet, cumulatively speaking. The fact that it has been open and neutral to ALL parties, and has resisted all forms of hacking and censorship shows us that really only this blockchain has stood up to the test of time and is worthy of such legal codification. 
But in the end, it won't matter. Governments will codify and "legalize" their own versions of bitcoin's blockchain, and with all fanfare declare them the next greatest innovation and completely worthy of our trust. And only until people find themselves at odds with, or aligned against such states, will they realize what a truly horrible mistake they made in allowing states to exert such digital control over their lives. But again, this won't matter much to the rest of the world, as Bitcoin has been, and will continue to be, the only best outlet and option for these digital refugees in a dystopian, state blockchain controlled world. In other words, Bitcoin will be just as it was designed to be, and working as intended.

It will eventually offer all the speed and capacity that Visa does without the trusted third party control and headspace that Visa or an arbitrary government can implement. 
And LN is open software that anyone can use and improve upon. Imagine everyone with internet access having full and complete secure access to the totality of Visa's financial network and not only that, ability to propose and implement changes to it that others can use.

The answer, as with Bitcoin, is to guarantee openness and neutrality across the world, so everyone can be on the same level playing field. Everyone is subject to the same non-discriminatory ruleset within the currency itself. Governments can do what they want after the fact.

I agree that its utility in this particular space is currently limited.

The idea isn't to artificially prop up the price for the price's sake.
The idea is for development, adoption, incentive, and usefulness to provide sufficient demand such that the price in fiat is no longer relevant and goods and services are priced in bitcoin.

This is true, but I think some folks fall under the misconception that many bitcoiners feel that in order to succeed, Bitcoin needs to completely dominate the entire financial industry and destroy it; to change the way people act and behave. 
This isn't true. I think most level-headed bitcoiners (and I'd like to include myself in that category, if I may), that bitcoin just needs to *survive* to succeed. If it acts as a virus within the existing banking system and begins to work from the inside out thereby bringing eventual massive disruption, change and reorganization, so be it. If it acts as a store of value or backbone for an internet of money, that's fine too. There are plenty of options for defining success. 
Not to get too far off on a tangent here, but one of the main problems I have with people like Roger Ver is that he tries to narrowly define what is Bitcoin, and make appeals to Satoshi's assumed guidance on where it should be in the future, and thereby categorize what it is and what it will be. I think he lacks the vision to truly get behind what Bitcoin can be, and that goal is so much larger than just day to day cash. Yeah, it will still function as that on layers, but what we know today as Bitcoin will not look anything like Bitcoin 20 or even 10 years from now.

Imagine, for example a 21 powered bitcoin cable box (if i am understanding this right). 
You load it with some BTC or set it to mine, and set its payment parameters/oracles (this only gets exponentially more powerful with smart contracts) and it automagically negotiates a worldwide network of iot, cloud based, and torrented media. It exchanges fractions of bitcoins for parts of files and brings you the content you want ad free, while mining when you go to sleep to help offset the fact that you got the cable box from 21 completely free.

Stop. 21 never asserted that. You did. You're hampering innovation and creativity with your narrow world view.
But here's the problem, and I hope that all who read this take it to heart. One of the main problems in this space is that people 
 NOT THINK BIG ENOUGH. 
That bears repeating, because there is no plausible argument against anything (even marginally useful) in the bitcoin space, as it approaches near infinite possibilities in terms of new hardware and software applications. Its about growing the network of money. To say that this kind of hardware is wrong because it can be coded into software applications that bitcoin already uses shows me that you have not truly opened your whole mind to the infinite innovative space that is to be bitcoin and the blockchain. I think a lot of us, yourself included, could be accused of having the hubris to think that we have perfection of vision deep into the future, and we can, with perfect clarity, see the complex interrelationships between hardware and software in a living, breathing bitcoin economy. This is what 21 are trying to establish, in my view. 
Think bigger. Think huge. As in, everything we know is about to be destroyed. Machines can pay machines (don't tell Skynet). 3d printers can pay and advertise for 3d printers. Satellites can monetize other satellites. And there is NOTHING any goverment can do to interfere with the value transfers that occur between these machines. Don't get too impatient, either. Just keep thinking bigger than you ever thought possible, in your dreams, and yes, even in your nightmares. Because I think bitcoin will enable it all, good, and yes, bad.
@_date: 2015-09-10 18:52:18

Any effort to "validate" the tech, in my view, also validates the premise behind bitcoin, making it eminently more valuable as an asset even, or especially if, it exists outside of any proposed system put forth by this conglomerate. 
To me, a permissioned, centralized cryptocurrency used for other than settlement purposes (which I'm sure they would love to do after validating it first as an internal settlement tool), would be an eminently trackable, traceable, dystopian nightmare for anyone hoping for anything nearing financial privacy/freedom from constant surveillance.

Also, Bitcoin cares not about these politicians. The simple, and harsh fact of the matter is is far too late to stop Bitcoin now. The die has already been cast. If it could have been killed and put to bed it would have been... much earlier in its nascent states.

@_date: 2015-04-01 00:45:03
This. 
I don't get why people still fall for this old idea that a cryptocurrency needs to be "backed" by anything physical (or fiat based). Once you deploy this kind of scheme, it makes it easy to see how impractical it would be to actually redeem your crypto for physical. Which makes you ask why use the crypto in the first place? Why decentralize it? Why not use a simple centralized, banking style, efficient ledger? 
The points that Bitcoin are making are self-evident. That this cryptocurrency is backed by the blockchain's inherent usefulness to mankind as a global decentralized immutable source of truth without counterparty risk. It's always on, always ready, always fungible, responds to no goverment or central bank, and is never reliant on a counterparty of some sort to be redeemable for goods or services. You hold it on your very own phone on your person.

It's not that they don't have the capacity to think outside of the box (aka without the need for constant gov intervention), it's that the *system itself* is breeding meta sheep who all retrieve information from common, unquestioning sources, and digital social media and news has cemented this sort of disease throughout our culture. 
Everyone likes to think that they are so sharp and on top of things but if you look deeper, you'll find that the vast majority of people these days just want to nest in their meta cocoon and ride the wave of conventional wisdom.
To truly grok bitcoin, you must be willing to take a step outside of your comfort zone, a voyage outside the womb of governmental authority and trust. You must learn to rely on the individual mind and the power of the open market to drive innovation.

But on the other hand they are diametrically challenged to the core of their beliefs by integrating into a system that their own system was designed to supplant. 
So you could look at this a number of ways: bitcoin could (and will) integrate into the legacy financial network and, like a virus, infect it from the inside out. Infect it with the ideals of enforceable, mathematical limits of scarcity and predicatability. 
But there again, the existing system has to unwittingly (or begrudgingly) agree to this process, and agree to a concession of sorts. And yet, Bitcoin does not rely on this concession to continue to function and gain traction (although slowly) much to the chagrin of early adopters and schemers hoping to get rich quick on crypto. 
So the long game wins the race here, as the existing network will obviously not cave in so easily until Bitcoin has continued to grow and exhibit the same kinds of dominating and secure characteristics that got it where it is today in the first place. TLDR, build, develop. Don't wait for the sloths at the top because, well you don't need to. No permission needed with Bitcoin. BUIDL.

You are absolutely right. However, considering that amount of time and money (aka skin in the game) many of said Bitcoiners have in the ecosystem, I'd say that the discussion/community here is quite placid and productive overall. Relatively speaking of course, considering that issues in Bitcoinland represent a nexus of several concepts you definitely wouldn't want to broach with the in-laws over Christmas dinner. 
Namely, politics, money, value, independence, social justice, corruption, power, poverty, among many others. 
Given all of the aforementioned factors, I have seen gaming communities far more toxic and deplorable than this particular forum. 
Moreover, I see dedicated antagonists and foils such as buttcoin as necessary and expected participants in a radical, confusing, and brilliant new technological innovation that changes the world forever. Nothing this complex and important should be easily grasped by the majority of mainstream society until it is appropriately dumbed-down and made accessible, both socially and politically, by most standards.

That doesn't make any sense. 
This isn't a problem, let alone something particular to bitcoin. We're talking about scarce resources. Scarcity helps create value, and it can come in all forms... knowledge, good looks, talent, creativity, monetary wealth. 
As long as there are limits in individual human ability to create prosperity for themselves with scarce resources, there will likely be limited monetary wealth amongst people. 
If you were smart or lucky enough to get into something before the masses, you deserve to be concurrently rewarded in subsequent value increases. 
I think what you are really trying to get at is the fundamental problem of many modern democracies, in that the richest 1% control inordinate amounts of global wealth, and that this is more a factor of "crony capitalistic" political systems that mask popular dissent through redistribution of wealth and media manipulation while perpetuating prosperity for high value donors and corporations... all of which perpetuates a cycle of wealth for a select few.

Bitcoin and Visa are NOWHERE near comparable in any shape manner or form, and to suggest so using such an analogy is either foolish or downright malicious. 
Bitcoin is an apolitical, neutral, decentralized global payment system (among many other things, of course), and Visa is quite the opposite in many respects. 
We don't want to be Visa. We don't need Visa. We need to protect the decentralization of bitcoin at all costs. Even if it means moving methodically, and trying the patience (or lack thereof) users.

It doesn't have to be "foreign". Numerous payment processors can instantly convert to local fiat in a way that is transparent to the user and business, thus allowing you another payment method that you can accept with the flick of a switch, for example:
So the question is, why NOT enable bitcoin payments? It requires no effort and allows you another source of revenue. Should you elect to convert to fiat instantly you endure no volatility risk. 
From a marketing standpoint, it makes you look like an industry leader in accepting new forms of digital cash and fostering global exchange.

Whether it is being hurt now or not is up to speculation and interpretation. If being hurt now means succeeding wildly later, then what we have is a tactical pause, which fails to move in the short term, allows us a strategic position in the long term. 
[I think the innovations that are being developed on layer 2 are going to provide the fungibility and anonymity that everyone wants.]( 
We just need to have the patience and foresight to not jump the gun and expose our flank to the deep state at a critical moment. Keeping bitcoin small, and immutable is key to this proposition, in my view. 
Saying that this development is holding back bitcoin is extremely shortsighted and immature. I've seen the video of Roger Ver trying to convince store owners to accept bitcoin in "The rise and rise of bitcoin". He wasn't particularly convincing, because he is getting the cart ahead of the horse. 
User demand isn't there yet, and we need not act with the false sense of urgency that it is. Most businesses that accept bitcoin today do it as a marketing gimmick, not because of overwhelming demand from users. I'd love for you to show me where the vast userbase is that really earns bitcoin on a day to day basis, and has an overwhelming need to spend it. You know, and I know, that it isn't being used like that.
So the way forward is clear. I suggest you get on board, or bring out your big guns and fork (again), because there is a distinct failure to "put up or shut up" coming from the opposition here. 
We'll go around and around all damn day with this argument if you want to.

Validation of the blockchain premise. I seek to participate in the bitcoin ecosystem in order to provide support to the idea of a singular, decentralized truth and validation system. I hope to see many financial and social systems migrate onto the blockchain and bring clarity and honesty to the world by doing away with some centralized, human-governed intermediaries.

Good point, because that very clause exists in both the California and Bitlicense legislation. 
But my feeling is that this will take so long to sort out and get implemented that Bitcoin will have moved on to greater things, making this look like a cheap imitator (which it is). 
Not to mention spooling up all the big banks and bureaucracy, personal wallets, securing the whole damn thing (hacks will be hilarious to watch), and you can see how this whole house of cards could end in tears. 
Not to mention now we have something that we have seen before in the data space (Napster &lt; Bittorent) the more centralized, higher friction alternative ALWAYS loses. Why haven't they learned? Because the dollar. They can never relinquish control - while Bitcoin feeds on frictionless, open access and innovation.

See that little "confirmations" link there at the bottom of your transaction? Click on it. 
It should take you to the "block explorer" web page if you're on your laptop/desktop.. probably blockr.io.
From there look at the top of the page where it says, "Tx:"
The following series of digits after the colon will be your Txid and can be entered into any block explorer elsewhere (such as blockchain.info), as well, to verify your transaction in the bitcoin block chain. 
Note: Sometimes the overall amount that you sent will be different than what you see on the block explorer because your actual amount sent was bundled with another, higher amount in order to get higher priority for processing. This is done to merge smaller transactions which include a fee to sort of "ride along" with a bigger transaction and process with less delay. 
You may also see at the bottom of the block explorer an additional amount to what you sent which could also be a "miner fee". This fee also acts as a tip to miners to incentivize them to include your transaction in the next block.

At this point, Coindesk is just confusing people. 
On the one hand, they are increasingly posting about, "blockchain technology" without clearly describing the nature of the blockchain they are referring to. Although with their ever increasing exposure for privatized blockchains like R3, I think we know where they are getting a lot of funding these days. 
And then on the other hand, they make use of the term, "the blockchain" in various articles, obviously (to most of us) referring to the bitcoin blockchain.

Ahhhhkkkshuallly... 
The annual budget for NATO itself (maintaining command structure, research, training etc) is 1.4 billion. If all NATO countries abide by the recommendation to spend at least 2% of GDP on defense in 2017 the projected sum of all NATO defense spending would be around 921 billion. 
Given a bitcoin market cap of 16.3 million mined coins today (out of a total possible of 21 million coins ever), the value of an individual bitcoin would work out to around $56,503 to equal the annual defense spending of NATO countries.

Hey buddy. Yeah, there are a bunch of us in this situation right now. Its tough to look on Zillow at mansions and shit and dream, but back in the real world, we have serious decisions to  make. 
You sound like you have your shit together financially and otherwise so listen to what I'm about to say. Don't do anything with your bitcoin stash. I understand you feel compelled to take trips and so forth and that is a really good, healthy thing to do at this point, to put things in perspective and see the world. I strongly encourage you to spend your dollar savings on that kind of thing, when practicable, and continue to hoard your bitcoin stash with the full expectation that it will one day make you vastly more wealthy to the point where such decisions are trivial to you.
I mean think about it. What do you have to lose? Sacrifice a trip or two for a while? Make a few cuts here and there to fit travel into your budget? You'll be kicking yourself in the ass down the line when you come to the realization that you spent what will effectively amount to millions on a trip somewhere. 
Think about that mantra they chanted in Brave New World, "Spending is better than mending, Spending is better than mending!" It's what they want you to do. Throw savings and caution and frugality to the wind, constantly seek the materialistic adrenaline shot of impulse purchasing. Consume. Obey. Sleep. Yeah, fuck that.

If you're going to argue with or try to convince the system as to why the system is unsuitable, then you're always going to have a bad day. So, show, don't tell, I guess. 
That is why I think bitcoin is so wonderful, in that it doesn't require people to ask, it simply enables them to buidl. In other words, why would I argue with the legacy banks of wall street when I am convinced that the banks of the future will not really be banks and will largely be based in Silicon Valley?

Bitcoin will become a successful currency and store of value *because* of the ability of the blockchain to securely and globally store assets within. 
Because entire segments of the economy are now set to become digitized because of this ability, bitcoin becomes the atomic unit, the grease, the fuel of this entire ecosystem. Without bitcoin you cannot make an entry into this global ledger, nor do you have an incentive mechanism for miners to mine and as such, it becomes the center of it all, the *perfect* currency.

Because she refuses to acknowledge that "centralized ledgers" are just another way of saying we're going to fleece you with ancillary fees and charges for the rest of your life. 
When you're passing through something centralized, under authority, you're sacrificing some kind of value somewhere. 
with bitcoin, you're circumventing all of that within the context of near instant peer to peer value exchange, and that extends to financial contracts, escrow etc etc. It reduces friction and enables permissionless innovation within its framework. She ought to see that.

We will be staggered by the innovation and change that we will see in this space in the next few years. 
As with any new technology there will be hiccups and problems. I do not deny those points. 
However, the idea here requires a bit of foresight and creativity. Because these innovations have not yet been built (systems to secure, trade more efficiently, etc) does not mean that they never will be. The trajectory of innovation just in the last year shows this clearly. 
The idea is that we are now unchained from a system that is inherently resistant to change. We are unchained from a lack of imagination. For once, we have a truly open, accessible value exchange network that uses existing infrastructure and which puts us in a position where *we* are the ones holding it back through lack of innovation and creation. 
Rather than the other way around, which is what we have today.

I've been using one for years with a non trivial amount. I love how it integrates with Chrome and Mycelium (I can plug it directly into my S7 and sign transactions with it). 
Not worried about it being intercepted because it contained tamper proofing on the package (not that this means much, but still..), and I haven't heard of anyone else having any issues with the open source nature of the device. 
Additionally, I haven't run into trouble with Chrome, as all the keys and signing are done internal within the device. If that is the case, then why not use it like an airlock for your bitcoin, and interface it with the most convenient software?

The US government *can't* ban it.. freedom of expression and all that. Of course, they can prevent it from becoming a legal tender for settlement. 
But to say that the "technology" can be used but the currency can't is absurd. They are inseparable, and peer to peer, global. Ask the MPAA and RIAA how their assaults on bittorrent went for them. Attacking or banning a decentralized and global form of value exchange is simply bound to end in tears... and not for bitcoiners.

For the same reason that it would be practically impossible for a large actor to destroy Bitcoin. [Watch]( Basically the point is that it is becoming enormously costly to attempt to mess with the network maliciously, and miners have an enormous economic incentive to just continue doing what they are doing and to proceed in the future with careful, cautious, community-minded changes that most constituencies agree on. No one would want to even try mining this theoretical alt chain, because it would die almost instantly, and they would have lost millions doing so.

He sees that Bitcoin is the valuative grease that makes all these presented ideas possible. It resides at the center of non participation, because I think he realizes that Bitcoin and the idea of value within a token (be it dollar, nickel, crypto, whatever) is nothing more than a place to put your stored work. 
You store a week's worth of work in paycheck dollars which you then put in the bank. You're forced to do this, to be a functional part of the current system. 
I think he sees the potential for all this stored work to be suddenly, and explosively released into a decoupled digital medium with low barriers to entry, and no friction, and no connection to the current system. 
This allows for a lot of new and disruptive paradigms in all aspects of society. This goes so far beyond the ridiculous "Tech Crunch Disrupt" (where disrupt is nothing more than a cliche these days) ideas of apps to find your parking spot or check how many times a day you poop, and actually gives the world something that can change mankind.

Bitcoin is very very small at the moment. Perhaps smaller than you might expect, given all the press it's gotten. Which should tell you something...
Take a look at [this price model device]( Set everything to zero except the coin supply, which is currently 16.3 million bitcoins in circulation (of course, many of these would be permanently lost due to mishandling-but we will never truly know how many due to the way bitcoin works.. they'll just be sitting permanently in an address never to move again).
Now move the percentage of total gold in circulation slider to 5%. You can see (roughly) that if Bitcoin takes even 5% of the total gold market as a store of value/medium exchange/savings device, etc), a SINGLE bitcoin will be worth over $24,500. 
Bitcoin offers many more advantages than disadvantages to gold in a digital world. Boomers understand gold, millenials understand digital. 
Ruminate on what this means for the price of bitcoin in the next few years. $2000 is a pittance.

You're completely missing the point.
Bitcoin's open ledger is public for a reason. There is no trusted third party or courthouse, or government to trust. That's the whole idea. Bitcoin cannot be altered by countries or kings. Otherwise why use a blockchain at all? It is far more efficient to just use a database where centralization occurs. 
With your ideallic govchain you've just duplicated the problem that records fail, governments corrupt, and men are fallible. 
What bitcoin provides is real and groundbreaking: NO trusted third party, openness, verifiability, all on a global scale. 
This gives us a real authentication mechanism, a real, unbiased "global notary" and finally the realization that-
*"Absence of evidence is evidence of absence".*

Let's switch that around:
How would you envision paying employees more money when the value of the currency is decreasing? 
This is an easier sell for the unthinking masses. Why? Because it makes them "feel" richer, more "affluent". They are now more predisposed to spend unwisely and frivolously on things that they could easily do without. 
Additionally, they are now psychologically biased to expect even more money in the future, so now they take out exorbitant loans on the basis of this presumption. 
And the loans are issued, and even encouraged (sub prime, poor credit) because the banks, from top to bottom have been infected with a false sense of demand and enabled by an overarching central banking monetary policy that prints money and practically hurls it from helicopters at the economy in the hopes of even more "expansion".
So it works really well, so long as you have a fractional reserve, man-behind-the-curtain, money printing forever ponzi scheme of an economy. 
But as we saw in 2008, and lately pretty much every 8 years or so (boom-bust cycle), this system just heats up to a breaking point, implodes, makes the insider top 1% richer, and rinses and repeats forever.

Agreed. I think central economic planners are either too vain or terrified that their measures do not appear to be working as intended. I'm sure they will shoot their load when it gets real ugly. 
What they fail to understand is the systemic, structural reformation in the economy and society that is taking place (due to many factors.. automation, cultural stagnation, etc), and assume, rather obtusely, that injecting stimulants into the economy time and again will magically generate inflation. However, no such recovery has appeared, and the failed attempts have wreaked havoc on their image as navigator of economies. 
The world economy will collapse at some point as a result of all of this debt. The fiat money system will implode, and a new historical paradigm will emerge (blockchains).

Alright, however we all know that bitcoin, as programmable money, can evolve and does evolve with time. 
Regulators and law enforcement will constantly be behind the power curve when it comes to understanding the true nature of what we have created here. It is unstoppable. Make the simile that it is as strong a force as human's desire to exchange value and trade in a free market place. Because that is what bitcoin truly exemplifies at its basic level. 
So "Helping" them, I think, is a term that should be used with caution, because I do not think that all of these companies want to destroy bitcoin's fungibility, as they are full aware that it would cause an enormous rift in the community and divide a very nascent space. And I think that helping law enforcment vis a vis rails that they have jurisdiction over, i.e., fiat to bitcoin and vice versa is appropriate. 
So, as more varied parties become familiar and comfortable with bitcoin and the blockchain, it evolves and envelops them. The power of network effect becomes too strong, and too global to truly contain. It is a strategic move. A good one, I think, with multiple benefits. 
Then, we win.

How is it a negative wage increase if the value of the goods and services bought using Bitcoin actually increases in the real world? 
Employees would gladly accept a wage "decrease" so long as prices elsewhere in the economy were decreasing such that overall the value of goods and services they could buy was greater then that of the previous year.
It seems to me to be more of a semantic, perceptive issue, i.e., we are psychologically addicted to this thought of "more" of everything all the time. Its not healthy. 
It all comes down to the idea of expectation. With Bitcoin, we don't fret about a rapidly inflating money supply, or a vast, unknown amount of government money printing. The mathematics govern the distribution rate, and the entire economy could adjust based off of known fundamentals. Whereas now, we are simply winging it, with the constant, unhealthy cycle of money printing on the vain hopes of a future expansion that is not materializing.

Companies in the ASIC space already have their order books full, and it takes time to scale up new ones. 
How do you account for all of this going completely unnoticed? You can certainly have a quintilion dollar market cap, if the proof of work mechanism is generated by something that is, in itself, scarce to obtain.

You provide them with your credit card login (you may not be comfortable doing this but i watch my transactions like a hawk and any transaction over a specified limit gets texted to me instantly anyway so little chance of them going fraudulent on me), they round up to the nearest dollar on every transaction and post a buy for you on coinbase at a dollar amount you specify (defaults to 6$). So for every 6 bucks in round-ups you make a buy and it is deposited into your coinbase account, if you have one (i do). 
Has worked as advertised so far. 
Keep in mind, they see EVERY transaction you make with that credit card, so they harvest tons of information from you.

Doesn't matter. A rejection is a foregone conclusion and is likely already priced in, to a degree. 
The only movement will be downwards initially due to daytraders following the momentum as they always do. Once that downwards momentum stops (it won't take long), it will rise again, and quickly.

Stop being pedantic. The simple point of this exercise is to demonstrate that safety deposit boxes might not be as safe and secure as many would assume. 
I used to store encrypted paper wallets in a safety deposit box, but since moving everything to a Trezor with seed backups in defferent locations, I now feel even more secure than I did when the bank was "securing" those papers. It's under my control and using the banks services is now obsolete and irrelevant. 
I look back fondly at what a fool I was to store those things there. The whole "have a swiss bank in your pocket" trope sounds mundane and cliche until one day it finally hits you and you realize that that is precisely what's happening here in bitcoin. And then you wake up.

This guy clearly does not understand how money works. He *thinks* he does, but he doesn't. 
Let me break it down for him; money, as we know it, is essentially a ledger entry, a ledger whose master guarantees it's validity. 
The US dollar, as such, is not backed by anything, other than [this]( Debt. And the mistaken hope that mounds of *new* debt will miraculously pull a rabbit out of a hat in the form of new growth, indefinitely. Its a radical, and unproven Keynesian pipe dream. And it is failing as we speak. 
Bitcoin, on the other hand, is backed by the mathematical sanctity of the blockchain. That is a ledger of an entirely new kind, one that does not revolve around trust, governments, mankind's prejudices (politics) and so on. It is backed by the purest, most unbiased and valid form of validation we know; mathematics.
To say that currency "must represent the value of society, economy and humanity" is fundamentally incorrect. It most certainly does not. What money *must* primarily accomplish, is present a *sound* ledger entry, and bitcoin, not dollars, or any other fiat currency, or even gold, presents us a way to mathematically do this, and prove/validate the entire procedure, from start to finish. 
Once you accomplish this, you can go on and talk about it being used as store of value or medium of exchange. Those are all things that can actually be *upgraded* via software applications with bitcoin.

[US Debt to GDP chart](
Pretty much this. Bitcoin needn't do everything for everyone. But if it succeeds at being sound money (which it is doing-and every day that it survives, i.e., doesn't completely die- only makes it stronger), then it provides an alternative option for some, as the chart suggests. 
Taking care of this huge debt (and unfunded liabilities) problem isn't just going to go away. And it is far, FAR more viable for any politician to kick the can down the road through currency debasement (which Qinfinity is) than find a viable and fiscally tough solution that requires  strong cut backs. 
All the politicians can do is hope, pray that cuts in certain aspects of government or stimulus/spending will jump start productivity, but as anyone can see, we are entering a new paradigm with increasing baby boomer retirements and large scale automation dragging the legacy economy down to a new equilibrium. 
Bitcoin provides a viable escape from this madness. One which can be freely exchanged and transmitted throughout the world at will, without the need for any kind of banking interference. 
You can only keep telling yourself that it's going to get better one day for so long. As the chart shows....

You are wholly wrong about fractional reserve. That's not the problem, the problem is the basis of the money that underpins it. A gold standard or a Bitcoin standard, if you will, is a return to responsible banking, which is precisely why we need to encourage bitcoin's integration into the legacy financial system.

What I don't understand is that inevitably (in my opinion), the consortium would be working towards the true goal of abolishing cash and digitizing currency. I mean the signs are everywhere. Hit people with negative interest rates, and freeze/limit their accounts when they try to attempt capital flight. You literally lock the doors to the burning building. 
So we'd have:
mass surveillance
negative interest rates
asset seizure
fractional reserve

 &gt;associating Bitcoin so directly with cheaper remittances is perhaps missing the point: the cryptocurrency has illuminated an even larger problem that it simply cannot solve on its own.
Within the framework of the fiat to bitcoin exchange process, perhaps. *Perhaps*. To say for sure is to say that you have truly perfected all possible routes of innovation in this fledgling space. Do you have the hubris to think that you have indeed accomplished that? 
But ultimately, sending bitcoin itself is what will solve all of these problems that you mention. The problem is the friction caused unnecessarily by onerous and lumbering regulation.. Unneeded obstacles that exist merely as a relic of an archaic technology, to the detriment of all. 
People need merely to *believe* in digital currency, and to do that the industry is slowly building systems to incentivize them to do that. Easier ways to secure it, send it, and so on. Building liquidity in exchange markets to stabilize prices and encourage acceptance. It won't be an overnight process, we realize that. 
Detractors to bitcoin say that we bitcoiners are looking through rose colored glasses, but I say that it is they who need to take their blinders off, and realize that each one of these problems is an entrepreneurial opportunity that is more readily addressed and profited from by the use of freely exchangeable digital money.

The logic and rationality of the argument presented by the alleged "shill" should cue you in to their abilities. The ones most likely to have success are the ones who learn to latch on to debatable, controversial, obscure ideas with which they will continuously spread doubt. 
These particular types of "shills" should be engaged, corrected where needed and reduced such that the economic incentives of their masters dictate that they expend their resources elsewhere. 
Alternatively, it could be argued that engaging these shills keeps them on the defensive, while innovation and adoption outflank them while they consider new ways to address the status quo. Action, reaction.

Such adoption would wipe out my ability to participate in this network, which would, even in first world countries, drive many such participants out and cause centralization in data centers for nodes.

Miner selectivity:
I just do not agree with Peter Todd on this. And I just don't think he appreciates the holistic concerns of the other constituencies within the Bitcoin community, such as the everyday users (not necessarily "participants" as he narrowly defines them), and wallet developers. Not to mention several other emerging forces with capital invested in this market such as Blockchain based entrepreneurs, payment processors (Bitpay/Coinbase), etc. 
The economic disincentives to coming to a healthy, free market conclusion to many of the theoretical problems that we are being presented with on paper are rapidly increasing daily. 
As markets gain liquidity, understanding, exposure, and funding for more innovation, increased pressures from a number of new sources also get placed on miners to self adjust in a way that is most beneficial for the network as a whole. In that regard I suppose that you could say that Bitcoin is self correcting in ways that are commonly regarded as best for the sustainment of the market overall. We have seen this in the past with ghash.io nearing 51% of the network hash rate, and consequent freak out on these very forums. 
Any radical attack, censorship attempt or threat posed by a miner or "bad actor" kills their business. It kills their investments, their time, and that of many of those involved in Bitcoin. Bitcoin stakeholders have a lot to lose should a mining entity prove malicious. Thus, It is my personal opinion that even the whisper of such issues with a mining entity poses tremendous pressure on that miner to resolve problems in the most widely accepted and conservative way possible. And this includes disregarding zero fee transactions or blacklisting transactions. 
So, to me, the question really should have been: do you believe in free market capitalism? Do you subscribe to Adam Smith's "invisible hand" principle?:
"Every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it ... He intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for society that it was no part of his intention. By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good."
If you ask me, the main problem with our financial system today is an abandonment of these very principles. Today, we have become increasingly jaded and wary of such ideas. Today, we place increased authority in centralized actors in the vain hope that centralization, and  monetary policy will create this "free market" for us. It has done quite the opposite. 
So, in a way, Bitcoin is the natural evolution of finance, in that it rejects these centralized ideas and presents us with a new way to do things through the lens of raw, market correcting mechanisms.
These are my layman/casual onlooker's observations. I am not a Bitcoin expert, rather, I just wanted to share some of my ideas with you because I think you and people like you are the future of Bitcoin.

I agree we might not see actual negative rates until things get truly apocalyptic. 
However, as I understand it, there are ways for the Fed to affect the ways banks hold money by making them increase their reserves which increases fees drastically for large cash account holders/businesses (many of whom are currently flush with cash). 
This in the hopes that flushing that liquidity into the risky securities casino (malinvestment/ridiculous stock buybacks) and will increase the velocity of money and help them achieve their inflation goals. 
Yeah I basically think its all going to blow up in their face. If you look at Caterpillar's stock/performance you can basically see that we are in a deep recession if not a depression already. All of this stuff is just masking the problem and keeping the patient injected with a steady flow of heroin.

Don't assume Obama and the US speak for the rest of the world. Their (our) input on this project will be telling, because eventually, regulatory systems will find themselves simply playing whack-a-mole with cryptocurrencies. Take one down, and another, more virulent, more anonymous, will pop up. So nations might be more compelled to simply work with, and encourage legal exchange of more benign pseudonymous cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. Hence, the [MIT Chain Anchor]( project, which I believe, is such an effort. 
Additionally, there are the very compelling legal arguments that support free exchange of information. And that is all bitcoin is... 1's and 0's. So as much as you cannot ban or make illegal the 1s ans 0s of email, you cannot prevent the exchange of bitcoin. And we have already seen a stable market demand for it, even during the worst and most turbulent times in it's history.
At some point, you have you conclude that technologies like bitcoin are a great litmus test for tyrants, because they demand free and open markets in practice, and do not ask permission to do so. Forbidding their use might be just the same as forbidding the exchange of sea shells, or beads as currency between people. No one is forced to use federal reserve notes as a medium of exchange. And likewise, no one can be forced *not* to use technologies like bitcoin for exchange of goods.

@_date: 2016-05-05 20:53:25
I think that it is the bleeding edge of computer science and cryptography nature of bitcoin, together with the profound social and political ramifications that it can bring about, that give it's most ardent and earliest supporters that kind of air.
I mean lets face it, most average, ordinary, non-insightful people will not see the forces at play here. Case in point: there is an entire subreddit devoted to individuals of just such persuasions at r/buttcoin. 
And yet the earliest backers had that peculiar kind of fringe thinking to embrace this new technology, and, concordantly, they had the personalities to match. 
When you know something is inevitable well before the crowd, you want to tell them about it, because you feel a social imperative to bring good, and change into the world. I think many early bitcoin adopters feel that they can be instrumental in bringing about that change. [I think this begins to scratch the surface on what is possible with blockchains.]( 
EDIT: In a reality that is increasingly digital, we need a neutral, decentralized source of digital truth. The only thing keeping us from a truly Orwellian dystopian future is encryption and the bitcoin blockchain recording and timestamping in a manner outside the realm of central governments and financial conglomerates.

Yahoo, we need to talk. 
Banks have no intention of disintermediating themselves. The only thing banks are truly interested in is controlling the flow and exchange of money, and locking your value up so that they can charge fees and levy consequences upon you for using it in a way that is not in line with whatever government is on hand. The moment you [fall out of line]( you will be separated from your money. Banks, quite literally, are gates for your personal value to pass through and those gates are closely guarded. Why do you think they are largely forming "consortiums" such as R3 and Chain? They don't want to help people, they want to lock people either in, or out. 
You *need* to understand that bitcoin is about precisely the OPPOSITE of all of those things. Where as "consortiums" like R3 privatized blockchains seek to create irrelevant, uninnovative intranets, bitcoin seeks to truly create an open, creative internet of money, where *everyone* is welcome to join and design new and exciting financial instruments. 
You can't do these things on private blockchains because you need a keyholder, a gatekeeper to let you in and provide access. Bitcoin is fundamentally more powerful because it doesn't rely on any "consortium" membership to provide access or authentication. In bitcoin, you trust no one, and everyone is welcome to join. This is how the truly decentralized, open, peer to peer system works. *You don't need permission*. *You don't need a private firm like Chain to design your blockchain*. The bitcoin blockchain is the fundamental open, innovative trust layer that allows everything to occur now that you have this layer of trust established. Without that neutral, open system, you have nothing but a privatized, hackable, gateable, controllable, influenced, state run blockchain that will lock your funds up faster than you can say "operation chokepoint".
Edit: 
From the opening paragraph: 


Why do you think Wall Street thinks, "bitcoin is uncool"? They can't control it. They can't dominate and regulate it. Of course they think it's uncool because it allows you to empower yourself to control the movement of your money by completely disintermediating them, rendering them useless for a vast swath of financial services. *OF COURSE* they think it's uncool. If they thought it *was* cool, I'd probably be alarmed.

@_date: 2015-03-01 15:39:25
Let me break it down for you. It's actually really simple. 
Debating against anti bitcoin positions is a fool's errand. Why? Because, while much of bitcoin is already hugely beneficial to society and finance, the vast majority of its best offerings simply have yet to be developed. 
So in a world where any human being is free to both access and innovate on an open, secure, trusted financial network (the bitcoin blockchain), new applications can and will be unveiled daily ANY of which could potentially change the world forever. 
You'd be arguing for things that haven't even been invented yet. The best part of bitcoin is what's to come. 
So i guess the moral of the story is; don't tell detractors why bitcoin is better. Show them by building something excellent. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 16:48:44

Ok, now I'm beginning to think you are a troll. This is not the case here, and again, false narrative that you, and people like you, are trying like hell to project on this community. 
Bitcoin, to me is about creating a rift between tyrants and liberty. Because now that money (and by virtue, value) has been reduced (elevated?) to a neutral, decentralized digital content type, we are free to transact as sovereign humans, so long as the network (the internet) is free. 
So by virtue, wherever the internet and free exchange of information is shut down, you can instantly identify the work of a tyrant.

Definition of a criminal is subject to local laws. Laws that in some cases, are confounded by the will of tyrants.

Bruce, this comes across as immature. 
Bitcoin is about openness and innovation, and that INCLUDES law enforcement and ancillary participants. You can't say, "hey this is only for white male libertarians with a certain world-view".
Businesses are going to search for association and profit, and they are going to collaborate with regulatory bodies. Not a damn thing you can do about it. Bitcoin will exist with or without them, and me personally, I'd rather they understand the system that will ultimately change finance.

Your earlier tweets suggested that the BCF would not be cooperating with this idea, from what I gathered. 
Law enforcement has a job to do that directly brings it into the fold of applicable participants in the community. Whether they are performing within the legality and scope of their authority is not relevant to this discussion. I think what Coin center is trying to do (if I may be so bold as to attempt to say) is to further legitimize bitcoin's appeal (and boost its value) by educating. 
There is nothing wrong with educating and opening up channels of communication. I know with many in this community this is heresy, and all communication lines should be shut down where it comes to law enforcement, but I also submit to you that we dwell in a sea of hypocrites here. Many of these very same people are relying on law enforcement to undo any and all of the Mt Gox debacle in the search for justice. 
So yes, they should have a part to play, and yes, education and communication is never a bad thing. I am not suggesting that we submit bitcoin to the powers of the state (whatever that might even mean), rather, that we acknowledge that cooperation with, and education of regulators and law enforcement is a necessary part of building stronger rails from fiat into bitcoin and vice versa. Its just part of doing business. 
With respect to bitcoin to bitcoin transactions, we all know that the decentralized nature of it protects against statism, as long as it stays true to its roots. Like Garzik said, censorship resistance is key. But what we are talking about here is more along the lines of traditional AML stuff, and when fiat is involved, there is no way around it, period. So why not open lines of dialogue?

Because unlike gold mining and distribution, bitcoin's inflation rate and mining subsidy are all perfectly planned out and enforced programmatically. 
Therefore, you could argue that the halving would have no effect on the price at all, since it would be already priced in. 
Only real-world problem i have with that is that humans are fallible and memories fade. Some people will forget that the rate of supply is about to decrease drastically and may be caught by suprise, or that newcomers who are enthusiastic about buying bitcoins now face a market with decreased supply.

@_date: 2015-03-04 01:30:59
I'll try:
The "Blockchain is fascinating but Bitcoin, meh, not so much" meme often spouted by the mainstream is borne out of one thing: fear. 
Fear of the lack of centralized control over a global, decentralized ledger. Without absolute majority control over the Bitcoin blockchain, no central actor can assert dominance over the essence of value exchange. And they hate that, because it robs them of power.
So naturally, they will utilize the strategem of denigrating the unique value token, Bitcoin, while applauding the generic mechanism by which it is codified (the blockchain), in the interest of ultimately developing their own token or blockchain mechanism. 
So competing, or alternate "blockchains" can indeed exist and prosper. There is nothing that prevents a competing blockchain from overtaking the Bitcoin blockchain provided that people value that network and its token enough that it is more useful to them. Be it Fedcoin, GoldmanSachsCoin, or YellenCoin, whatever. 
So when you're talking about the "blockchain" as a generic technology, well then if it is not secured by a majority network using a token of value that requires some sort of "work" to obtain, then this "blockchain" becomes nothing more than a glorified excel spreadsheet in the cloud. 
Which is practically what we have with the Fed. We trust their centralized, hidden ledger that they will not issue currency in an irresponsible way.

It is interesting to see how the privatized blockchain enthusiasts are [thoroughly denigrating]( bitcoin's blockchain as unsuitable to mainstream finance and banking. It is open source and programmable, for pete's sakes. It has changed, will change, and is changing. 
They cannot, or will not come to terms with the fact that THE MOST important thing in establishing trust for financial transactions is censorship resistance, not what government A or government B threatens to do if you break their laws. Many laws and governments around the world are part of the problem, so why not establish a system of trust that simply does not require their input? One that relies on a neutral pact of trust in computation, e.g., bitcoin. This is the only way to do a truly open and global digital economy without third parties. 
Oh, I remember: they can't control that and need to force "trust" with the false aegis of violence and laws which are pushed through Congress in the dead of night by way of heavily lobbied oligarchs.

It depends on what you're trying to accomplish. If you're open to establishing lines of communication in regards to understanding bitcoin, then that is enhancing appeal to many more participants. The tone of the tweet comes across as childish and anti-authoritarian, just saying... Its almost like you're sticking your tongue out at them and that just doesn't help the situation. 
If it were the case where you're trying to backdoor bitcoin by cozying up to law enforcement, then I oppose that as well. I don't think that is what the alliance is trying to do. I think they will actually help bring bitcoin's legitimacy to a whole new level. 
I'm not worried about people innovating with bitcoin, even to the point where all transactions are anonymous, etc. That could veyr well happen. But communicating and educating is a great idea right now, and will help get the ball rolling, I think. So why not open the BCF to that idea on some basic level. It's about perception. Besides, at the rate of innovation, agencies will be so far behind the power curve with programmable money, that they will be a step behind in most cases. The idea is to get them more comfortable with it, and it is the citizen's and congress' job to ensure that they are fulfilling their duties to the extent that the Constitution allows.

I don't think this would take the form of a literal "paradrop". More likely the following in this description(Adair Turner, a member of the Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee and a Chairman of the Financial Services Authority),:
A tax cut or a public expenditure increase which would not otherwise occur. 
It can be one-off or repeated over time.
And it would typically involve the creation of additional deposit rather than paper money. This would be initially in the form of deposit money in the government’s own current accounts which would then be transferred into private deposit accounts either as a tax cut or through additional public expenditure.
From Ben Bernanke, Some Thoughts on Monetary Policy in Japan, 2003
“Consider for example a tax cut for households and businesses that is explicitly coupled with incremental Bank of Japan purchases of government debt – so that the tax cut is in effect financed by money creation”

Just to add a few things to clarify some of what else has been stated in this thread:
All you need is the Trezor. Thats it. You don't need to even use the Chrome extension/online wallet on the Trezor website until you're ready to obtain a receive address/QR code or to view balances or send. Heck, you could just set the Trezor up with your android Mycelium wallet and keep track of your balances that way. 
But rest assured, just because you have set up the Trezor with Mycelium doesn't mean that if someone takes your phone they have your bitcoins. it just sets the phone up with what they call a "watch address" which can observe balances, but not spend. To spend you actually need to plud the Trezor into the phone and physically click on the Trezor when it prompts you to send the transaction. 
You can even use the Mycelium watch address to receive bitcoins from the QR scanner on the ATM. Or plug the Trezor into your computer and generate a receive QR code and/or address that way, then have the ATM send the coins to that address. From that point on, the coins will be "on the Trezor". Not really, because all that is really being stored there are the keys to access those bitcoins on the block chain.  
The online wallet is not a "hot wallet" because it doesn't have anything "hot" in it. It just sees the balances on your Trezor device when you plug it in, and again, like Mycelium, allows you to initiate transactions and then physically verify the information on the Trezor itself and then physically click the send key on the Trezor to send bitcoins. 
Thats the beauty of these so called, "hardware wallets". They maintain the keys on the device at all times, and sending bitcoins requires you to not only have the device in hand, but to PHYSICALLY PRESS the send button when prompted to send bitcoins. Without that device, you can't do squat, unless of course, you are recovering the wallet using the backup seed, which is important to do when first setting up the Trezor, in case you lose the device. 
In this way, you can actually plug that Trezor into a computer that is loaded with malware and viruses, and still transact with security, because all the important stuff is in the device, not on the computer. Everything gets sent out, not in. Sort of like a walled garden for your bitcoins. 
@_date: 2015-10-23 19:39:58
You have no idea what they are or are not planning. You are purely speculating. 
Here's the thing, bitcoin is about freedom for all, not just a select focus group. And yes, that means even law enforcement and business alliances who are completely free to associate themselves outside of bitcoin. The protocol does not care, and bitcoin may still be accepted regardless of what they do. 
What you're essentially saying is that outside of the government and law enforcement directly altering bitcoin's core software, that they should not be allowed to become a free and open participant in the process. That is hypocritical and against the spirit of bitcoin, which is open market exchange, innovation and participation for all. 
And yes, "all" includes law enforcement and governmental participants. You can't exclude certain segments of the community just because politically you do not approve of them. That is in opposition to all you're standing for. Oh wait, you're an anarchist, so you probably don't stand for anything. Please go move to Somalia, it may be the kind of anarchistic society you're looking for.

No, don't worry. This happened to me as well a few times. I think it has to do with Coinbase's wallet function. There have been multiple times when I have had a balance far and away greater (yes, much higher than the send amount + astronomical fees) than the amount requested on the QR code from Bitpay. The Coinbase wallet would give me the message that there was insufficient funds available. Weird. 
Other times, the Bitpay request would simply time out after a Coinbase wallet send, and Bitpay sent the refund amount back to the refund address that I specified in my email. This process took about 24 hours. 
It's sometimes like Bitpay never even sees the transaction as relayed to the network. Not sure who's fault this is but from a user perspective, it sucks. 
@_date: 2017-05-20 15:31:31
Interesting. One would think the Chrome wallet extension (which I'm assuming you were using to verify the first transaction) would contain a direct tie-in to a block explorer before updating the wallet itself to reflect that the transaction went though.
I mean, I'm no expert, but I know that you can actually click on the transaction and be taken to a block explorer to manually verify the transaction in the blockchain, but what I'm referring to is the Chrome wallet itself. How could they allow it so that a transaction appears (and later disappears) without it actually being recorded as pending by a block explorer.

You're completely missing the point. The idea here, is that we have created instant, NEUTRAL (politically/ideologically/financially), auditable, open, cheap, accessible, *available*, programmable money. 
Now what you have is an instant, open, neutral financial network with no middle man that anyone on the planet can access anywhere, anytime, with no boundaries, and with no fees. 
And surely you will realize that this is just the beginning. Because the money is programmable, we are able to do smart contracts, and smart property, etc., such that any one of these transactions (because they are, again, all verifiable in the blockchain), dwell in a realm of perfect trust. And that enables you to attach anything to these transactions. So the next time you send me an aircraft carrier for free, please let me know, because I'm sure you'll realize the extent of the technological innovation present if you are able to suddenly do something like that... because now we are.

Perhaps frame one class around a simple idea that they can relate to in that "tech" oriented area that they are predisposed to. Let's say, you stand up and write on the board the following:
"Why can't World of Warcraft gold be a world currency?" And use that as a launching point for a discussion. I bet it will really get them thinking in new ways. 
Yeah, its a silly concept to most everyone, but the concept isn't really the point. The point is getting young minds to open up to the very idea of "what is value", "what creates value", "where does money come from", "why do we use money and what are its limitations", Etc.
I think Andreas Antonopolus framed the idea in a very novel way: He said once that money is a form of social expression. Exchanging value with money expresses the desire to create a substitute for my work, place it in a different form, and trade it with another for something that I want. So in that way, we communicate. But how are we communicating efficiently now? How can we communicate globally better?
Edit: I guess what I am getting at here is, when presented with an otherwise disinterested or skeptical audience, you have to realize that their basic mindset (like most people nowadays) is going to be, "well, ok Bitcoin. But why the hell do we even need it? I don't understand it! I don't even know what it is!". And now all of a sudden you're teaching all these kinds of different concepts in one conversation. Its way to overwhelming for virtually most adults. So we need to get them to be the ones identifying the problems that we have with the current system in the first place through interesting, guided discussions. And we should be intellectually honest about pointing out the flaws and dangers in Bitcoin itself along the way.

I realize that this likely isn't your personal position, but I should add that it wouldn't. In much the same way that disarming the citizenry does not prevent crime. By their very definition and nature, criminals can and will break the law and will obtain the very weapons the unarmed citizenry could have otherwise defended themselves with.
Similarly, with the ban or prevention of peer to peer transactions, criminals would simply find another cryptocurrency, indeed, a more venomous, truly anonymous, and untraceable variety. 
Law enforcement should consider itself lucky that we have Bitcoin as it is in its current iteration. It can make their jobs much easier in some cases.

It's amusing that these central-planner deviants think that the only problem with the original stimulus was that it wasn't big enough. They had to "sell" it to the American people for under a trillion. 
And where are we now? Roubini goes on to detail a pretty decent and comprehensive list of reasons for exactly why many of us believe that this system is fundamentally flawed: It hasn't fixed anything since 2008! And yet their only retort is that we didn't do enough. What a load of folly. You can never convince someone who is entrenched so deeply in their own lies. Not to mention, as an "economic hack" under Roubini's definition, I don't even get a seat at the table to have an opinion in the first place. I'm just wrong no matter what.
Let me break it down for you, Roubini. You're on your way out. It doesn't matter what you think, or what you do, or where you teach, or what little sycophantic morons you piddle around with in NYC. Your time is coming, and sooner or later this system is going to unravel spectacularly. 
First, deflation (as you predicted), then hyperinflation. That's how it works. The only recourse your kind will have (and the Fed has even admitted that they are out of tools in their toolkit) is to print more and more.
The ONLY reason a rate hike is on the table at the Fed is so they can back themselves out of the corner and make it appear that there is something else that they can do at that point when things take a turn for the ugly. As it stands now, at ZIRP, you have no tools, and you have boxed yourself in. If the Fed bumps up rates, they can allege to the sheeple that they are "fixing" the problem again with a rate decrease. 
As it stands now, there are no more "extraordinary measures" left for you to employ.

Bitcoin is difficult to explain to grown adults, let alone children. Not to mention most people could not care less about how money works...they just want more of it, and the "stuff" it brings. Its a non starter in most cases, and a lot of us here forget that simple fact because we are biased in our interest for this technology. You have to start this exercise assuming that every one of them most likely does not want to hear about any of this. So you're going to have to find a way to make it interesting, engaging, and manageable.
Bitcoin kind of sits at an important nexus of political thought, ideology, economics, computer science, and philosophy. And any proper understanding beyond simply sending and receiving it will ultimately delve into such concepts.
How do you conduct a class for children, let alone a series of classes for them on such ideas? Do you recall ever having a complex class series on currency, economics and philosophy all in one during middle school? I don't. So, ideally, a class would be kept incredibly simple and basic, using lots of real world examples creatively baked into a package that they can understand. So, lets say, a class on basic economics first, touching on what money really is, and how it is created, and so forth. Perhaps using examples from popular video games such as World of Warcraft, or Runescape. If presented in this light, you might gain their interest, otherwise I can almost guarantee they will drift off on you.
Perhaps after the basics are covered simply, one by one (one for each class) then you can introduce the sending and receiving of it. And then talk about how that works. I would get on Khan academy and check out some introductory videos, and even view James D'Angelo's videos as well. You're going to have to be very knowledgeable on the subject in order to simplify it creatively, in a way that harnesses their attention. 
And be prepared for some wacky questions that you may not have ever thought of, because children sometimes ask things that set adults off, because they simplify things in ways that our minds overlook.

But why have anything "backed" by gold at all? 
There is always some inherent trust, some counterparty risk that the issuer has the gold they say they do in the first place. 
With bitcoin the underlying reserve asset is always perfectly transparent, verifiable, and fungible. Therefore, it seems to me that the way things ought to be is reversed: things should be"backed" by bitcoin, not gold. You can always prove with certainty that the bitcoin backing the contract is present on the blockchain. You can not do this with gold, short of inspecting the vault yourself and conducting a purity test, no?
Theoretically, given the fraud in gold markets only "holders" of physical gold trust that they actually have that value. With bitcoin, the underlying asset may be digital in nature, but it is always verifiable and transferable, no matter what. 
Of course, gold has the advantage of centuries of price discovery and vast markets, but in today's digital world i think it is only a matter of time before bitcoin achieves the stability, trust and mainstream perception as a reliable reserve instrument.

Gavin went for something that Andreas was smart enough to avoid: staking his professional reputation on a charlatan and not only that... he did it *on the charlatan's terms*. 
Gavin allowed himself to be used as a subject matter expert, an authority, in a system that *requires no authority-just mathematical proofs*, and Craig exploited that for his own gain. Gavin had the most to lose in this proposition; he had to take the computer, USB security, and verification process at face value...under strict NDA and without public verification or peer review. His conclusions of veracity have already been debunked after more thoughtful analysis.
All of this amounts to a huge, potentially unrepairable mistake for Gavin, in my view. To be so gullible and naive, to allow himself to be used in this way... Let me put it succinctly: Gavin had the most to lose as the "subject matter expert here". CSW had to *appeal* to authority for verification and authenticity, which means that Gavin held all the cards, and as such, should have been a stalwart in taking every public verification mechanism available to insist that CSW do all of this verification process in full daylight, not behind closed doors, as was the case. 
This PR stunt is a ridiculous farce, and Gavin, you better damn well believe that you will pay for it professionally.

It could be that because the mandates are so onerous, so far-reaching, that only entrenched, established players will be able to compete. Perhaps this is what they want. 
However, in the end, it will likely lend legitimacy in terms of the public's broader perception of Bitcoin, hastening the day when a breach can occur between the fiat-Bitcoin interchanges and middlemen (for whom the Bitlicense is intended). 
And thus, in a circuitous route, end up negating the need for this regulation in the first place, because, at that juncture, Bitcoin will have already become too widespread, and too viral to contain.

Unfortunately, while I generally agree with the OP in theory, it is plainly evident that the vast majority of people cannot manage or store their Bitcoins without the aid of a third party. With Bitcoin you have but ONE chance. One slip up and everything is gone, forever. Everyone is not a hacker wizard. Hell, even the [hacker wizards themselves are losing Bitcoin to hacks and theft](
Hence, these services. If these services are useful, they will propagate, regardless of what you say or do, OP. People will naturally gravitate towards a path that reduces their involvement in the every day micromanagement of the security of their earnings. You don't like it? Tough shit, Coinbase, Circle, et al are doing it, so let the market decide. 
Have a better idea? Invent something that makes the market gravitate towards your product or application. 
The idea behind Bitcoin is free and open markets. We are seeing this in action. Decentralization is not going to instantly materialize in the mainstream conscience until a mechanism evolves that incentivizes the public to adopt it naturally. 
Bitcoin ETFs make even less sense than services like these. Hell, you can't even trade an ETF at all hours of the day or night. Why buy a share in a Bitcoin ETF if you can just freely buy and hold Bitcoin and sell it at a higher exchange rate yourself?

". was so concerned about $crypto users using  for deceptive and illegal financial activity, yet his top campaign donation came from a company that had to forfeit $13.3 million to the US Government for facilitating illegal gambling." -from the Coincenter twitter feed.
Remember who these politicians work for and get on Twitter and let them know how you feel. 
Personally, I find this attempt deeply insulting. As someone who was with one of the first units in Afghanistan after 911 and who has devoted years and years to the service of this government and its people, I am disgusted by people like this who so transparently take massive donations from banks and become mouthpieces for US hegemony and petrodollar dominance through bans, rather than meaningful marketplace competition. 
If the US dollar is so strong, then it should be robust enough to participate in a global economy that is bound to be rife with competitive challenges in fintech.... such as Bitcoin. and others. If we, as a people, need to resort to BANs to protect the dollar from these, it is evidence to the *contrary*- that the dollar is weak, not strong. That which warrants bans in favor of it, is by definition- weak. 
I strongly urge politicians and their millenial advisors (like the ones seated behind the Congressman in the video above) to stay true to your Constitutional principles and teach older politicians that in the global internet driven economy, banning only serves to isolate and weaken.. like AOL or Compuserve back in the 90's. Creating walled gardens- islands of stagnant innovation that were doomed to fail because they failed to expose their systems to the world. The dollar is no different. 
You risk turning ordinary, law abiding people like me into driven opposition to a hegemony of governmental bans. Because that is precisely what legislation like this would do. 
There is room for both the dollar AND Bitcoin to succeed and prosper. What we need are politicians who seek to understand, learn and adapt.

Eric. This has nothing to do with libertarian ideology, which I tend towards, personally. It has to do with presentation and effectively onboarding newcomers to this tech. Casinos are *in business* to take people's money away from them. How about the marketing geniuses at bitcoin.com stop trying to wedge their own desire to rape and pillage newcomers to bitcoin by not channelling the newest of the new directly into a place designed to *relieve them of their money*. 
Say all you want about Circle and Coinbase, but at least they can design a proper marketing approach and style geared towards a trendy, tech-savvy userbase that they are hoping to attract.

I really see the point in this. 
That is, if you are a Russian apparatchik. The idea is to create a govcoin under the popular guise of "blockchain good bitcoin bad", "innovation", "cyber tech enhancements" memes. 
The real story, however, is one of control. Cryptocurrency used in this way, issued by a central government, ushers forth the absolute worst form of Orwellian control over the populace. Russians would be subject to their government setting absurd monetary policy with a mouse click, and victimized by arbitrary withdrawal limits, involuntary taxation, capital controls, and surveillance. 
A centralized cryptocurrency is, without a doubt, unspeakably evil. By design, it will be a way for the Russian government to systematically rob the populace via wanton inflation and money creation.

Surely. Coinbase needs to do what is good for Coinbase. They need to say whatever they need to say to the right people and whisper in the right ears the sweet nothings that those people want to hear. Whatever. 
And then Bitcoin marches on. 
What you and many other "true believers" on this sub fail to realize is that Bitcoin is so much more powerful than just Coinbase or their regulatory efforts. If you half appreciated the power of what is going on here, you (and others down voting me) would grok that Bitcoin will infect this financial system like a virus and ANY effort to integrate it will help, even if that effort is highly regulatory in nature or with oversight. Every thing helps at this point, because at this point it doesn't matter. Bitcoin has already achieved the runway needed for success and it's far too late to ban it, regulate it or control it. 
Bitcoin is an uncontrollable force of nature unleashed on to this world, and if you really understand that much, you understand that the flailings of regulators just generate more press and attention that help it along in the long run. 
Have fun.

Bitcoin doesn't need main stream adoption to be anywhere near what you call "successful". We don't need it to replace pay pal, or to be used at point of sale on a wide scale. 
What we need is for it to be trusted, and to be valued enough so that people who want to send money over the internet can do so using bitcoin without the slightest concern for it's efficacy. It is the trust in the technology, and that it works. That is precisely why the first mover advantage is so key in cryptocurrency. No other cryptocurrency is as easy to use, accepted or supported. By this time, Bitcoin is visible in the media enough to now start getting some traction and positive press.

**Participating institutions** could directly exchange credit-push transactions with (near) realtime authorization/clearing and the payer’s bank guarantee of good funds.
Once both institutions agree a transaction is valid, the payment is cleared and automatically posted to end-user
accounts, while **the protocol facilitates the time stamping and logging of the transaction in a central ledger**.
Settlement occurs through existing systems (wire, NSS, etc.) at intraday windows. Leveraging public
infrastructure could reduce or eliminate network clearing fees, but this may be offset by higher security-related
Perspectives on Option 2 from Industry Interviews
 Some view direct clearing as a component of any other design option and as an evolution of payment architecture, as opposed to a separate design option
 There is an instinctual aversion to this option because of security concerns of using public IP infrastructure (though others note this move is already occurring in places within today’s infrastructure)
 Smaller financial institutions are concerned that they lack capabilities or scale to participate in this option

Well first off, a person who says Bitcoin has no intrinsic value is a person who does not understand the value of secure data. 
I could sell you data by using a medium, like the internet, or a USB thumb drive. The data might be useful or not, and the higher it's usefulness to you the more value it likely has to you as well. 
So then it follows that if I introduce a way to exchange data that is completely secure and unforgeable (the bitcoin blockchain), is easy to store and secure (bitcoin), is easily transportable anywhere in the world (bitcoin), separates itself from the dystopian social credit system that is the US financial network (bitcoin), and is mathematically scarce in supply (bitcoin), would you not then have at least some value for this item depending on who you were and your use cases? 
So then the argument becomes, ok, well, then maybe bitcoin does have some value to people, and over the years people have been willing to pay a lot of fiat money for this thing. 
And then comes the point when they shift gears into the next line of ignorant lines of logic such as "it won't scale", "it is used by terrorists (which ironically implies value), "it is too difficult for grandma to use", etc. All 2013 arguments. 
So you're going to see this circle of ignorance go around and  around with people until they can truly grasp the revolution that is at hand here with cryptocurrencies. 
But the common man and woman don't grasp such things so easily which is why it is *never* a highly profitable investment strategy to wait for the sheeple to line up behind something in unanimous support of it and wait for returns. You must understand (and value) something that is apart from the common person's logic and confounds their sensibilities. 
Such is bitcoin.

You don't gronk LN. At all. 
When you set it up, you need 5,6 connections which are all fully anonymous and onion routed to each other to obtain access to the network. 
This has only grown more decentralized and robust over time, which we have seen this past year in truth, as opposed to your conjecture. 
There is no incentive to route through central hubs because the fees are absolutely miniscule anyway and they offer no real speed or connectivity advantage to even remote outliers on the network. you just need to connect through someone else. And most node software will do that for you in a way that is advantageous for the entire network, not your so called, "hubs".

This is a fascinating topic, and it gives rise to many questions as to the future of our economy. Personally, my gut reaction is that the old model, the 20th century model of moar, moar, moar everything is going away. 
With the rise of automation like this, and the "Uberization" of entire professions, human qualitative work will be desired, yet we may see a big change in expectations of what we consider healthy economic output. I mean, currently we expect everything, all the time. Our Keyensian overlords' whole debt model insists on this. Though our future economy could evolve into something more small scale, more village-like, with less emphasis on human manufacturing jobs due to automation, and more emphasis on quality workmanship where humans can provide such a thing. 
Use of Bitcoin with its protocol enforcing a smooth, predictable, yet decreasing production rate would help to scale down this ridiculous boom-bust debt model that we currently endure... allowing us to adapt into a scaled down economy of automation, and decentralization, whereas now, we insist on inflating everything everywhere with the hopes that future productivity and capitalization will melt away all of the debt that we are taking on. It won't. I don't see milllenials amenable to working that way in the future. 
I see them working less, not more. I see productivity taking a downward turn, and emphasis on living conditions and health, research and entertainment. Look at Japan and their youth. What does this teach us?
The most difficult transition to this economy will be convincing the 20th century modelers that the debt-inflation model doesn't work anymore. That automation will take jobs away, that we need to retool everything to adapt to a more deflationary economy that is predictable, and sustainable. I do not expect the inflationists to go down easy, though. They will likely insist on war, or other outlets for massive injections of easy money in their last ditch attempts to keep the Keynesian dream alive.

The fact that I can't simply open it in a browser and do things with it kind of made it a little cumbersome to me. I suppose in a specific use case it might be useful, but how many people did they really expect to download a client and run it whenever they needed to shop quickly? Everything is going to the cloud, and this is like a step back from a usability perspective. I recognize that the technical details require them to do it this way, and I'm simply saying that this is irrelevant, unless they have a specific business model to address a specific set of users that they are targeting. From a mass usability standpoint, I don't see how they could expect this to take off in it's current form.

Logical fallacy. You are shifting the goalposts of what "sky is falling" means until everyone can mutually agree that the sky is indeed falling. At that point, you're already extinct. 
Face it. There are growing competitors to bitcoin. Bitcoin cannot rest on its first mover advantage forever. It must innovate and it is currently being held hostage by a certain maleficent group of miners who know they have leverage and use willing stooges such as yourself to coerce the users to wait indefinitely. Miners are literally holding the great advantages of Segwit, as leverage, over our heads in order to eek out more fees and preserve unfair, unintended advantages that were not anticipated or shared (ASICBOOST). The block reward just isn't enough for them, they need to have it all.  
This is a Mexican standoff. UASF is showing the opponent its intent to win by putting its trigger on a timer and walking away.

Well it creates an incentive mechanism for those who want or need ultra fast transaction speed. So the tradeoff for locking up some of your bitcoins in payment channels is just that. The thing is, this creates a more wholesome network and structure for building on, thus incentivizing more bitcoins to join and go out of circulation for some time (many will eventually return as channels close though). So I would say yes, it does effectively limit bitcoin's velocity and supply so provided the demand stays the same for the problems Bitcoin solves for people it would seem to elevate the price. 
It's pretty genius.

It is impossible to disillusion ETH folks.

I hold that there is no, and should not be, a "community" like that in bitcoin. Entities and thought leaders should be motivated by greed or principle, and through a vicious competitive process, emerge victorious in the marketplace of ideas. This is how successful businesses achieve greatness. They don't all gather in the same room and talk about "moving fast and breaking things", particularly when it comes to money and financial contracts. 
Sitting around chanting vapid mantras like, "making the world a better place", gets you Theranos. In fact, I think Silicon Valley, the HBO series, is particularly adept at satirizing that entire mode of thought.

1.) Bitcoin's developers already have extremely low overhead because much of the infrastructure (computers, programmers, the internet itself, etc) are relatively cheap (capital expenditure wise) to obtain anywhere in the world and in some cases are free. 
2.) What liquidity is left will flow to areas such as gold and Bitcoin, which stand to offer protection from negative interest rates, capital controls, and in some cases, outright confiscation.
3.) Miners will adjust as they always do. The weak will be culled, and the strong will emerge. Which may result in more centralization, which worries me.

I don't know about that one buddy.. If anything I like to think that I am *under*thinking it. Once I realized that Bitcoin is much more than just a currency unit.. it is a protocol, a network for a new world of financial applications and trust... it blew me away. 
As for single addresses and veblen, I see no better way to provably declare your wealth than to sign something with a private key. This shows that you really do have instant control and financial access to any market in the world, instantly, and without borders or bank controls. This is liquid. This is the kind of money that Gordon Gecko would drool over. Hell, he could even [put it on his wall and call it art]( And there isn't a damn thing anyone could do about it. 
Have you seen [this]( It really demonstrated to me personally that ANY unit of bitcoin, no matter how small, is immensely important to the world, as it represents a unit of trust that cannot be tampered with.

I don't see how this is a net negative. In fact, I think this is incredible. Here's why:
Bitcoin is finite. It is a scarce resource, unlike fiat. With each passing trade of each passing day, each passing minute, more and more bitcoins are taken out of circulation due to hodlers, and yes, even loss due to mishandling. At any rate, the function of additional markets only increases the availability of provably scarce resources, and further fuels the rocket engines on the way to the m__n.

It is very important that developers and team leaders like Elizabeth keep that mentality of slow and steady wins the race. Security is key. All of this shit falls apart so fast when weak foundations are laid...
That being said, having set up an LN full node and used Ya'lls for the first time to post and comment on posts using fractions of a bitcoin for practically no fee, it is apparent to me that this (Lightning) is the future. It just works so quickly and seamlessly. For practically nothing. 
To realize that the only limitation now is not governments or states, but the imagination and creativity of the *developers themselves* is mind boggling. No longer do centralized services and companies control the flow and path of innovation in and around money. We do. 
To be frank I got that same feeling that I did when I first read the Satoshi White Paper. Limitless possibilities with nothing in the way of progress. 
In a way I am a bit envious of these developers in this new space as they are like the warriors on the front lines of the biggest war to be fought with the legacy financial system. Those of us who fought actual wars used different skills sets and weapons that are now useless in this new kind of digital fight. It's almost like being a Helot peasant watching the Spartans go do battle and being unable to directly participate. 
But I'll just be content to be a peasant in this fight. Lending resources as I may to help these front line girls and guys. This is a different kind of fight with different warriors. Godspeed to them, as this is the toughest foe yet.

[This is nothing near a hub and spoke system]( 
Why would you want to "split up" well connected nodes? No one knows who is sending or receiving in the Lightning Network anyway, because the packets are onion routed, which means that any send looks like it is 20 hops long and all you can see as an individual node are the hop in front of you and the hop after you when you receive a packet. So if you are participating in the network all you see is encrypted traffic where you can never be sure if you are the destination or the middle man. This is another reason why Coinbase will probably not implement Lightning because it completely breaks their KYC! LN offers far superior privacy than on chain bitcoin transactions. 
LN doesn't need a hub anyway because systems like LN Labs' autopilot feature automatically and heuristically connects your node to another node that the system deems optimal for the entire network (my rough understanding). 
So what sense does it make for a government to try to play whack a mole with nodes when another could just simply pop up and just as well connected and funded by a long time bitcoin hodler with plenty of liquidity to add? 
Chase and Wells Fargo aren't holders of Bitcoin anyway, so they are not big players in this system.

Very interesting and I agree. This sign is ironic in that you simply *cannot* trust the EU and the Euro currency, because governments and institutions are subject to fraud and corruption and even more so when they are handling money. And we have known this since the Greek times (power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely). 
Bitcoin's answer to this is to distribute this trust so massively and through mathematics, that you never have a lever to pull, a button to push to force the system. We are putting our trust in a neutral third party, a mathematical principle of sorts. Not institutions subject to all sorts of political shape shifting. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 17:42:44
Please forgive me but your questions sound like rehashed CNBC/Peter Schiff talking points from 2014. With over 1 million users on Reddit it becomes exhausting to answer these fundamental questions time and time and time again to people and have to deal with these common misconceptions and to fight off the misinformation that typically arises during price swings. 
What you need to know ultimately is that Bitcoin is the ultimate expression of financial sovereignty. No government, police or state organization can infringe on this most basic principle of financial independence when using this system. The money you have is yours, and no one can ever take that from you. No safe can be robbed, no one can even verify that you indeed have any bitcoin in the first place to torture you for it. 
And not only that, Bitcoin allows you to send pieces of that financial sovereignty anywhere in the world instantly through your own home network. This concept is so unbelievably powerful and important that it bears mentioning. 
No one ever guaranteed Bitcoin will be the end all be all of cryptocurrency. However, Bitcoin is the first blockchain. It is the largest, most secure, most widely used and accepted blockchain. While this may not matter much to you, it does very much matter to those looking to place their money in such a system now, or in the near future. These people are looking for something secure to experiment with the technology. You think they are more likely to do it with some avant garde new "technology" of a new ICO coin? we have a word for that, it's called scam. And there have been a lot of them. So hedging your argument through lack of information by saying, "well..... bitcoin isn't going to be the winner because something better will eventually come along", isn't really intellectually honest, you know? I mean, that is setting up a classic straw man and saying, "this straw man will eventually knock down this entire suit of armor". 
So yes, it is possible that another mysterious crypto will eventually overtake Bitcoin but with each passing day that becomes less likely due to network effect. And because of the power of network effect we can't even completely rid ourselves of IPV4. But IPV6 is coming! Yeah, it's been coming for over a decade. Any day now. First mover advantage is huge, and security is huge, and Bitcoin presents with both of these enormously. Far greater than any other coin to the extent that even nation-states cannot overcome to mining hashpower security that goes into every transaction you make with Bitcoin. 
As far as Gold is concerned, Bitcoin outclasses Gold in every conceivable way. Manufacturing utility is a marginal factor here because Bitcoin is provably secure, and that's all that matters in the age of digital bearer assets. Once this creeps into the public perception Gold will be greatly diminished, as you need physical possession to truly ensure validity and even then you need to make sure of purity.. just ask the Canadian Mint with it's fraudulent bars. There is no fraudulent Bitcoin. There is no shipping with bitcoin or security risk to transmit anywhere. Literally everything about it is superior to Gold when considered as an asset, but you are correct years of human perception are difficult to overcome through network effect, so I suppose this proves my earlier point using one of yours.

Basically impossible if you use the right security practices. Bitcoin itself is essentially unhackable.

No, I don't misunderstand at all. The legal definition of "controlling digital assets" varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction (if it is even established at all), so this is very open for confusion on so many levels. For example, if you have a multisignature wallet, you don't have control of anything, because the other signatories are keyholders in the process to initiate a transaction. Setting up time locked coins to be unlocked the moment you clear customs is trivial. You cannot argue that you in any way "control" time locked coins or multi sig coins. 
This is ridiculous on its face, and clarifying the entire process will be a huge headache for everyone involved. My opinion on the matter is that whatever steps the bill takes to set a framework for compliance will instantly be made obsolete. 
You are also forgetting that confidential transactions and other technologies will make enforcement of this bill, as I understand it, altogether impossible.

"By transacting and settling off-blockchain"
"do not broadcast (transactions) to the blockchain"
That would be taking the text a bit too literally. Lightning Network establish an "anchor" transaction to the bitcoin blockchain on open and close of a channel. Everything else in between is a cryptographically secure, trustless, and anonymous IOU. Bitcoin is the Alpha and Omega of that entire system. So one could make a micropayment, say, for an article on a web page, and you could say that payment "settled" but in fact without Lightning eventually settling these IOUs to the actual bitcoin blockchain, the entire system would simply not work.

Because the Bitcoin protocol is a system that mathematically ensures that there can not be more than 21 million bitcoins... ever. It will take until the year 2140 to distribute all of these, and this process occurs over a gradually sloping curve so that the supply diminishes greatly after the first few years (we are currently at about 16.4 million bitcoin in circulation). 
This way, everyone knows precisely how many bitcoin there will theoretically be in existence at any given time (even in the future). 
Of course, this does not allow for the thousands and perhaps hundreds of thousands of bitcoins that were either lost or discarded in the early years when no one valued bitcoin for anything other than "nerd money". 
So whereas fiat currency is backed by governments and debt, bitcoin is backed by its own self-validating security mechanism that keeps itself in the warzone of internet security open to attack 24/7 and still thrives. Bitcoin is backed by its ability to survive and hold true to its protocol, nothing more. It is mathematical honesty ia world drowning in corruption and distrust. 
If the Bitcoin economy decides to shift this by way of a protocol change, a change can theoretically occur, but then this would effectively be an altcoin, or, something other than bitcoin. 
21 is bitcoin. You cannot change that. If you do, it is something else.

You're missing his point entirely. 
His premise is that newcomers who are far less informed and educated than he will be completely taken off guard by the security measures needed to truly deal with this kind of money. Terrible accidents will happen and that will adversely affect the crypto community as a whole, not just Bitcoin. 
He is actually making an educated, reasoned appeal to everyone in that the rapid expansion of Coinbase needs to be accompanied by a commiserate enhancement of security measures and guidelines. 
If he can make these kinds of mistakes, imagine the mistakes newcomers will inevitably experience. This is the market responding to market forces. This will eventually come back to bite Coinbase in the ass if they don't wake up and step it up.

Wrong context.
He's referring to credit cards. 
Have you ever been in a store that discourages, or doesn't accept credit cards? Typically a gas station? I have. It is precisely for these reasons that this occurs.
Some stores even put out signs for discounts if paying with cash. The fees from Visa on small proprietors is very real. I've spoken with them and it hurts their bottom line. A better system is moving in.

You encrypt the seed phrase with a bip 38 password. This ensures that even if someone were to find your paper, it would still need the passphrase to use the seed. Additionally, Hardware wallets like trezor have an additional pin number that you can select. So even if someone were to find the hardware wallet, they would need your bip 38 password, and pin number. You can literally lose that thing in Times Square and still have it be perfectly secure provided that you selected and adequate bip 38 password. 
The same thing applies to your seed phrase that stored on your piece of paper. If it is protected or encrypted with a password it also is perfectly secure if someone should find it. It is truly easy to secure Bitcoins properly provided that you have the right information.

Someone tell me how this does not make bitcoin into "NetkiPay", or "CirclePay", or "CoinbasePay", or any myriad other centralized, systemic wallets who only want to turn a buck off of bitcoin? 
What happens to fungibility when I go to the store and they tell me that they cannot accept bitcoins from my Mycelium wallet, rather, only an AML/KYC approved, centralized, surveilled version?
Its like asking retailers to, on the one hand, accept "safe, identified" payers, rather than transact with "terrorist/pedophile/pirates" who are using the non-AML/KYC version. 
I think this presents merchants and bitcoin accepters with little choice other than get in line with identity, or find another payment form and avoid the damn trouble altogether?

I agree. The silicon valley utopian idea that the more you pay someone for doing nothing, the more they are incentivized to actually do something productive and useful to society is nothing but a ruse. 
Look at the basic welfare and societal backstop systems around the world today? Have they spurred a new age of innovation and work ethic? Hell no, if anything they have helped establish a permanent underclass, incapable of thinking, reasoning and acting on their own.. [Legions of kids staying at home with their parents doing nothing but riding the couch and playing XBox all day long]( With VR it will only get worse. There will be no need to go out and do anything when these kids can become VR gods on their thrones of the living room realm. 
But that is the key to this ruse: Zuckerberg et al want precisely this. They WANT a non thinking, non questioning permanent underclass RELYING on UBI and welfare subsidies because that keeps them in power by *ensuring* that these classes vote for them and their candidate in perpetuity. This is a payment system for votes and power, nothing more. 
All a man has is himself, his ability to reason logically and function in the world, to learn and carve out a living and to protect his family honorably. Through hard work and ingenuity may he succeed, but alas not all men are destined to do so, and the failures of those who did not help make us stronger as a species. 
Contrary to silicon valley and their pie-in-the-sky perpetual unicorn theories, not everyone can win, and technology isn't the answer to all of life's questions.

Heh. He shills for ETH because it is "backed" by an alliance of well-known tech companies. This is actually a weakness. Hell, if Vitalik Tweets the wrong way, the whole ecosystem will be in a state of shock. It's far too centralized and reliant on figures of authority. 
Precisely the reason why I think bitcoin is so important, which is ironically the same reasons this guy does not like bitcoin... it's decentralization and over reliance on no particular aspect of the ecosystem. 
People not grokking bitcoin has made me a lot of money. Unfortunately for guys like this, they will be on the wrong side of history because wrapping your mind around a system that *literally fights* the current system, is mentally and spiritually challenging. 
Kinda like that fight scene in the movie, "They Live". It went on forever in that alley way, but the metaphor John Carpenter was trying to convey was that sometimes you have to fight people, literally, to wake them up from a repressive mode of existence that sometimes they just want to remain in comfort- placid and institutionalized; Sleepwalking through life.

Not necessarily. Some people are just having fun adding liquidity to the network. For example that guy at LNBIG.com. Early bitcoiners with a lot of money to fool around with. 
But that's the thing. As they fool around there are serious consequences since there is real money on the table now. And if the network grows holistically or not, it can still serve people by functioning better. So it kind of appears to be out of control at this point, like a virus in nature.

I'd like to emphasize this point and say to the OP- how long does it take for a check to actually clear? A week or more? How about a wire transfer or credit card purchase. For credit cards the funds don't actually settle with the bank for up to 28 days. So the definition of "efficient" is quite important here and it is worthwhile making the distinction.
With bitcoin, we have a triple entry accounting system where the transaction IS the receipt. This is pretty novel, and comes with some risks, of course, as the settlement is akin to cash payment and although it is transmitted and received instantly, often clears within 10 minutes for most transactions, perhaps longer by a bit for larger amounts if you want to get multiple confirmations in the block chain say, to buy a house, etc. But the kicker is that NO third party is necessary to validate these transactions, which, if we do this right with second layer solutions, can provide the backbone, or settlement layer for a new world of fintech. 
Trust is the main issue. Once we have that established without the need for a third party, we can dramatically cut costs, access restrictions and barriers to entry for millions of people, perhaps billions. 
Every order of financial application can theoretically be based on this new trust model , with bitcoin providing the settlement layer in this new internet of money.

I'm sensing a little bit of.. not sure, fear? Uncertainty? Doubt? All from the establishment. This is growing interesting because it is being talked about seriously now as a threat or at least, something that everyone needs to at least consider. Bitcoin never garnered such respect or even visibility years ago. 


Exactly. That's why we have bitcoin. We're tired of a cartel of bankers controlling the value of that which we use as money. 


You're damn straight. Imagine being charged fees on your bank balances because a cartel of "smart people" decided to experiment with deeply negative rates. No where to run, indeed! So it's withdraw everything and shove it into stocks, which, as we know, never form bubbles. Stocks which are now largely dependent on central bank policy and interest rates. Or go be the good hyperconsumer that you are and just buy stuff. Or in short, this amounts to everything under central bank control in one way or the other. 


Uh oh..


Fedbank savings an loan. So what about all of those banking stocks and local credit unions? With a fed digital currency (no cash world) we'd just take this entire sector of the economy and dissolve it? This is mind boggling what's being discussed here. 


Beyond that, foreigners outside the digital central banking country might desert their own banks and deposit directly with the foreign central bank, or indirectly via some local intermediary. The increased ease of shifting deposits into a safe foreign asset might exacerbate the flows of capital in and out according to changing perceptions of the health of the domestic banking system, amplifying the credit cycle in their home country.
This is precisely why, in a central-bank-controlled digital currency, everything would necessarily have to be tracked and surveilled 100%. Every flow, every transaction traced and analyzed. Imagine the withdrawal limits during bank runs, the government in complete control of capital movement. This sounds dystopic, honestly. 


There is no flight to safety with a central bank digital currency. That's the whole point. You are trapped with no recourse, as the author pointed out earlier in the article. This is precisely the problem that Bitcoin aims to solve. 


What could go wrong in a one-world-government-banking-hegemony? Surely it's worked out well in the past.. Oh wait, even the author sounds dubious here. 
Interesting article in the tone of almost "accepting the inevitable" by the powers that be. Bitcoin apparently is here to stay and needs to be dealt with. This process will cause huge ripples in the legacy financial system and perhaps even change it forever. This is exactly the purpose of bitcoin. It doesn't care or ask for permission. It just does is's thing and relies on a free people to make their own decisions as to it's efficacy and value. It requires no government to stand in and back it or control it.

They had the opportunity to hype it all they wanted, uplifting it independently, but instead their leadership chose to use the launch as an opportunity to decry and defame bitcoin for some of the very principles that make it sound money. Using those principles against us, making  the system seem weaker, and the other currency the stronger.

With silicon valley, it's always "But it's different this time", "Making the world a better place". Didn't you even watch Silicon Valley? I'd say they were spot on about a lot of the metaphors there, as Mike Judge has a knack for lampooning the present only for us end up with precisely that situation in the future. Everyone's looking for the next unicorn. Everything can be solved through technology, etc. etc. Except it's politics and society they are looking to tinker with now. 


In socialist vacuums where the negative effects are camouflaged by degrading the fiat currency used to fuel such abominations. Also, we both know that "empirical evidence" is far from truth. [Typically, the people generating said "empirical evidence" are the people controlling and directing the project in question and are thus compromised intellectually.](


It absolutely must, and will. The economies and people that successfully adapt to this change will be better suited to lead the world in the 21st century and beyond. Those that do not will have their failures masked by further debt and currency devaluation (which UBI is FYI). 


People in a healthy economy should be flexible and adapt based on the current market for goods and services in that economy. The moment you start fiddling with this basic universal truth, is the moment you start poisoning the well of human enterprise, and you give rise to backstops for every manner of alternate (read useless and unproductive) pursuits: pursuits that have nothing to do with economic forces and which are largely unfruitful for society. A man's basic duty is to his God, his county, his family and to himself. Rob him of the basic duty to provide and he stops thinking like a man. When he stops providing the basic instinct to protect is reduced, and greatly diminished are his sense of civic duty, independence, respect of others, and pride. Mankind has always been forged in the fires of adversity. Get out of the way and let this happen or you will pay the price eventually, somewhere down the line. Stop pushing these kinds of social experiments on us. Allow schools to actually teach students to LEARN rather than be subject to ridiculous social projects like Common Core and Standardized Testing, etc. Stop destroying our colleges by making them money-making, debt bubbles funding degeneracy and little actual learning. It is precisely these kinds of societal ailments that endless fiat money printing enables, and UBI is no different. 


Exactly. These are human factors which have driven humankind through the ages. Take them away through UBI and you will inevitably end up with:
-Permanent underclass that would rather immerse themselves in fruitless leisure than useful work. These people will be unthinking, unworking, and largely a drain on society. There will be no element of civic duty involved in any professional pursuit. Each person will be making aberrant decisions based on flawed concepts of supply and demand due to the UBI tainting the entire economic picture. Have fun with an underclass of barista carpenters with handlebar mustaches who only have enough incentive to get through the day to make it home and play video games. 
-Society that no longer is receptive to the idea of individual liberties or private property rights. If you are relocating income, why stop there? Why not allocate others' property and, as follows, sovereignty as well? What you're speaking of is the onset of communism, and it is antithetical to the American way of life. go fool around with it in a failing European nation where the GDP amounts to one american state. I'm sure you'll find many "scientists" there more than willing to declare a beta test of UBI as a glowing success for other nations to follow...
-Theft through taxation. This is a slippery slope. Once you declare UBI you have embarked on a crusade against individuality. The logic carries over too- why isn't an Iphone a universal right? Why not healthcare? Why not a vehicle, a computer? I mean, all of these things are totally necessary to function in the modern, automated economy, right? 
The point is that all of this stuff just robs the civilization of adapting and overcoming this formative change that must be undertaken to phase in the new economy. What you'd have us do is invent a magic sauce that makes "everyone win" even though this is impossible to do. This is nature.. there are winners and losers. Let the losers lose. Let the market and economy contract and painful readjustment take place. Nature will solve this situation quickly through brutal lessons learned, unfortunately. Start fighting this current will only get us more bailouts, which is what UBI is, inherently, a bailout of humanity funded by productive citizenry, and enabled through low interest rates and endless money printing. You better thank your lucky stars you have that luxury of fiat because otherwise we wouldn't even be having this conversation.
