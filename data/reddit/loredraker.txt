in my books legacy is the bitcoin that identifies with the whitepaper, core does not. when will you learn.
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:53:22
you people are so brainwashed....
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:22:33
Nope, you are
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:57:28
GET IT IN YOUR HEAD YOU ABSOLUTE MORON. DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT A FORK IS????? Jesus you people are stupid, do I have to spell it out for you. A fork, as stated in the BTC WHITEPAPER WHICH YOU CLEARLY HAVE NEVER READ, is a "defensive mechanism". It's a mechanism imposed to PROTECT BITCOIN. THE REAL BITCOIN BEING BITCOIN CASH. DO YOU NOT NOTICE THAT BITCOIN CASH OPERATES LIKE THE OLD BITCOIN, AND BTC DOESN't WORK AT ALL? HAVE YOU EVER STOPPED AND ACTUALLY THOUGHT ABOUT THAT?

fuck you, bch is bitcoin, BTC doesnt even work for transactions WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT OF BITCOIN wow you people are sad
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:53:00
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:22:47
BTC is the one doing the pointless forks, not BCH
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:24:52
LN is centralized trash. You are literally supporting a digital fiat scam pieve of vapourware.
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:23:43
Ever thought that your information is the disinformation? after all, BCH works and is being adopted by merchants, BTC isnt. Wake up
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:59:09
Wrong, the bcash chain had bigger blocks but RETAINED BITCOINS ROADMAP. BTC completely changed it's roadmap to incorporate lightning, a seemingly centralized service.......

hurr durr vrewy smurt comment
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:21:45
nope, BTC doesn't work. BTC is getting paid by banks. Do your research
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:21:57
bitcoin cash is bitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:14:38
hmmmm or maybe BTC will become obsolete considering you can't even transact with it
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:47:14
hence why bitcoin cash exists, and why there is so much artificial propoganda
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:32:17
Why do you think it would lead to centralization? Lightning network is the peak of centralization
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:45:14
What? yeah we know that... That's not what i was talking about obviously
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:56:17
I'll tell you what's happening. Blockstream has been bought out by the banks. These mining attacks were justified. Because what their plan is, is to cripple btc to offer lightning network as the saviour, forcing transactions offchain and back into their control 
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:50:48
Surprised your logical post hasnt been r3moved by bl0xstr3am already... I wish people realised these attacks are warranted. Assuming this is not d3l3t3d, people on this reddit need to take a close look at the accusers, and ask yourself why people might be rallying behind cash

Coinbase can set up automatic bitcoin buys each week from a nominated credit card
Just use coinbase, they store all their coins offline and are insured for everything if they ever gor hacked. Very accessible site that doubles as a wallet and an exchange
@_date: 2017-07-27 12:18:48
i dont think coinbase is a good idea for the fork
@_date: 2017-07-27 12:20:15
Bitcoin is raising in value, so its a smart investment. It also is decentralized, so it supports more power to the people and anonymity, taking the power away from governments and banks and giving finance back to the people.
@_date: 2017-07-27 12:17:51
Buy bitcoin from coinbase or localbitcoins, and sit it in the exchange or look up a suitable wallet
@_date: 2017-07-27 05:06:58
There is no issue, sometimes sites like coinbase have limited withdrawals temporarily when there was unusually large traffic.
