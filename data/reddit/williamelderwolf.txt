Write a complaint to the CFPB. In Coinbases defence they probably grew as a company by 1000% over the past few months and are super back logged and we're unprepared for this much activity

That's a dumb comment because that factually was the case. Use google

And if the price goes up from 10,000 to 30,000 then buying at 20,000 is reasonable. You just didn't realize it at the time.
You make some good points but saying it will crash because it's not tied to a value isn't true. When we took the USD of the gold standard everyone thought USD would tank because it's now intrinsically worth nothing. But it's still here and every currency that was pegged to the USD is still doing fine.
If you're so scared of holding something worth nothing then sell all your USD and buy gold. I'll hodl BTC and I'll see ya on the other side m8

Yes, more value was lost because even though they didn't declare bankruptcy yet, they were out of money and the exchanges where 70% of people bought Bitcoin were effectively closed with delays.
The small bump was around the same time they reopened exchanges and closed them again. It stayed low after the incident and continued to decline because bitcoins reputation was ruined. People thought investing in it wasn't safe. Government agencies started regulated the exchanges. Law suits were flying over the $450 million lost. 
Took so long to recover because of the bad stigma it got after the event. And even the same reasons from the paragraph above. Also people are just now understanding the uses of block chain technology and even banks are investing in it causing a huge interest in the currency again.

Yeah, but it lost value because of the Mt. Gox hack, not a bubble. Everyone freaked out and sold. At the time of the hack Mt. Gox was handling 70% of btc transactions

Actually a lot of average people thought Bitcoin itself was hacked and was insecure. They didn't realize Mt Gox just had abysmal IT security in place. So they stayed away from it for a long time. I still have to explain to a lot of normies that a company was hacked and not the currency itself.
The gold analogy is a straw man because gold has no substitute. But BTC and every currency are substitutes for each other. So if BTC is stolen from an exchange and I have my BTC held there, I will accept less and less USD for each BTC as long as I get something before the exchange implodes. Like a run on an insolvent bank.
Are people speculating on BTC? Yes. But since the value of Bitcoin is not tied to anything, there is no reasonable or unreasonable price. It's not like a stock market bubble. Stocks can be exactly valued with cash flow analysis so they have a reasonable price. VC doesn't have a reasonable price so it's whatever the market decides. There's no intrinsic price so we can't say it's over or under valued at any moment

You're dense. It's all related. All the news articles about Mt. Gox being insolvent came out at the end of November 2013. There's an article in Wired saying people were experiencing delays of months when withdrawing. The price tanked as everyone tried to sell and withdraw from the biggest btc exchange. That caused the crash in November. They declared bankruptcy in February shortly after.
Lol the psychological significance argument doesn't even make sense
