i'm guessing they have hired nintendo's networking team.
@_date: 2014-02-07 18:24:36
You should have used coinjar
@_date: 2014-01-21 05:54:49
Wow, so was Bitcoin a few years ago. Do you wonder why there is a growing exodus from your precious coin? It's people like you!
Oh and get with the times.. Its actually worth 50 cents at the moment. But please dont make your way over to the dogecoin community. 
Thanks, peace.
@_date: 2014-02-08 03:00:20
ahhhhhh it all makes sense now. he's french.
@_date: 2014-01-25 11:02:21
welcome to the twilight zone. where people are leaving dogecoin for bitcoin, and not vice versa.
@_date: 2014-02-07 06:57:57
im 16 and jacked
@_date: 2014-02-07 22:29:25
Haha. Lesson learned
@_date: 2014-02-07 06:57:21
Bitcoin is great.

Even you? I used to log onto BBS too, it was amazing to me back then
@_date: 2013-12-17 08:10:46
Wow. Upvotes?

ahhh. My mistake.
@_date: 2013-11-22 01:55:56
Just got my 0.0012. Woo.
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:27:14
Sure, send me 10btc and I'll get right on that. But I'm a bit swamped so I won't think about it much.
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:14:56
Tyler durden?
@_date: 2013-11-25 07:46:54
If you had a wallet on your hard drive it would still be there. If you trusted it to the cloud.... Not so much.
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:30:29
But if you had been paid in btc for the last month.... Your pay would have essentially been halved.
@_date: 2013-11-17 11:04:12
I would tell them they're a cool funny person and that I would like to be their friend
@_date: 2013-12-19 08:40:23
I agree. Its just that whenever I see someone saying that it is possible, they get flamed.
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:16:49
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:27:04
Is this a troll
@_date: 2013-11-21 07:36:58
I'll buy them for 450
@_date: 2013-12-21 10:03:59
They will weep for your $14
@_date: 2013-11-24 20:11:23
Yes I am a bitcoin expert, send one my way so I can verify the authenticity, so you know you aren't dealing with fakes :)
@_date: 2013-11-19 10:48:46
I got a tip for you too. Work hard, and be good to your mother.
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:16:31
I've downloaded and signed up... Waiting for an email..
@_date: 2013-11-22 00:23:49
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:53:47
That's satoshi
@_date: 2013-11-25 08:08:04
Who knows... It could go the other way. And 80 cents for 80Mbtc would look expensive. I don't think it will, but I would laugh.
@_date: 2013-11-25 07:50:41
I feel like that's what is happening on aus exchanges, the prices seem fairly high.
@_date: 2013-12-19 07:13:21
I agree, I still have coins and am not worried about it. But its still possible. The more people using and the more keys being generated increases the risk.
And the laws of probability say anything is possible.
@_date: 2013-11-14 10:16:53
Local bitcoin usually requires a meet up? Sorry I'm very new
@_date: 2013-12-21 10:24:32
Bitcoin are AOL
Altcoins are Web2.0
Everyone can make stupid comparisons. Cryptocurrency is burgeoning.  Nobody knows what the future holds.
@_date: 2013-11-26 04:29:13
Why so desperate for 20 dollars of btc at 5am in the morning? 
@_date: 2013-12-26 00:45:37
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:37:35
Lol. Everyone here so mad.
The guys speaks truth.
@_date: 2013-11-25 05:12:31
Seems you have a very nasty cough
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:12:12
Scumbag nomad.
Says 30% off + free worldwide shipping
Gives 30% off but Charges international shipping.
@_date: 2013-12-03 03:53:34
Explain what they do and what the point of joining would be
@_date: 2013-11-17 10:37:44
Tell me about bit coin :D I'll wait for next  Christmas haha
But really, I do need to learn more.
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:56:45
Was having trouble downloading it to my android device, in chrome. Moved to my  laptop and it downloaded fine. Logged in no worries, had a play. Seems pretty nice. 
No email yet but it hasn't been long
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:22:58
Very astute
@_date: 2013-11-25 07:29:30
Could still be on the hard drive, pretty easy to access if it's not the hard drive that is the problem 
@_date: 2013-12-13 07:20:26
Below this post: lots of butthurt on both sides. What a joke...
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:59:56
With one weird trick this housewife makes 7300 downvotes a month
@_date: 2013-11-29 13:52:27
Gotta say, I get the same feeling
@_date: 2013-12-17 09:28:55
That's fair enough, but have you seen his posts in just about every thread lately? Just so abrasive.
@_date: 2013-12-07 21:27:29
Ever heard of an engraving tool?
@_date: 2013-12-03 02:46:07
Yayyyy, we're going to the moooooon charlie
-@_date: 2013-11-24 20:09:13
Oh yeah, cos he really needs the coin.. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 06:27:43
Yeah, more or less thanks. I heard that coinjar got a $500,000aud grant from the government. So they must be supporting it somewhat.
I might look into this, I'm pretty interested.
@_date: 2013-11-25 13:25:45
Why store your coins in another company's wallet?
@_date: 2013-12-21 21:52:22
I don't believe that it gets labeled deleted. It just is "below the comment threshold". For it to be deleted, you have to delete it.
@_date: 2013-11-25 08:03:11
What about just taking a paper wallet to China? Im not planning on doing this. But I'm sure some Chinese dual nationals would, if they were heading home to see family anyway
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:13:35
Unless their real wealth lies elsewhere, and that is why they want to destroy faith in bitcoin...
@_date: 2013-11-25 08:24:59
Like putting something somewhere for safe keeping, never to be found again. Haha. Best of luck.
@_date: 2013-11-25 07:58:23
Browser history? Some cryptic text file you made? A keylogger jealous ex installed on your PC?
I wouldn't be so secret because I know I would only trick myself haha.
@_date: 2013-11-25 08:23:38
Good point
@_date: 2013-12-19 05:13:06
The cold hard truth of the matter is......... Nothing. You *could* create one and it just so happens to have 1000 coins in it. Yes, I understand it is super highly improbable. 
But it is still a possibility..... (Bitcoin fanatics seem to gloss over or completely deny this fact)
Something you don't need to worry about with real banks (oops sorry.... "Fiat banks"). Just saying.
