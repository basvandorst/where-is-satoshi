Oh, cool! Thanks for the info!
@_date: 2014-12-13 19:59:07
Okay, thanks. Sometimes it's just hard to find a good offer on localbitcoins.

I'm not looking to become a millionaire. I just want to make a bit of a profit.
@_date: 2014-12-13 01:58:25
I'm in winnipeg, manitoba. Haven't seen any though.
@_date: 2014-12-13 01:51:42
Thank you so much, I appreciate your generosity a lot!
@_date: 2014-12-13 02:05:56
Yeah it's pretty nice up here.
@_date: 2017-02-23 14:07:57
Yeah price is probably going to drop to $400 if you want I could take your btc off of you for about $500 I'm alright with the $100 loss
@_date: 2017-03-13 21:07:26
It dipped below $1000 on some exchanges 
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:33:54
Yes it will help. Anyone who says it won't do anything is an idiot and anyone who says it's an instant 100% fix is an idiot.
There's no way of knowing how fast wallets and exchanges will start using Segwit but over the next month or two we will be seeing a reduced mempool size and lower fees. It helps but it doesn't solve everything it's not a magic fix everything button like some people think which is why I think we may see the price go down a bit when Segwit activates.
@_date: 2017-01-02 21:27:47
I'd split the coins and keep them both in different locations

Not a podcast but the cryptoverse on YouTube makes good daily analysis of altcoins and Bitcoin news.
@_date: 2017-01-03 01:48:58
Just realized I posted it 3 times somehow.
@_date: 2017-08-25 00:13:14
Mining power has left to bch again. If the price of bch continues on this downtrend we should see the hashrate flow back to btc soon. Currently bch is only about 7% more profitable to mine. If however bch doesn't drop or goes up a bit the network will be screwed for a few days until bch's difficulty resets.

Bitcoin is easier to store, governments can't take it from you.
It can also be used as a currency if you don't want to just hold it like gold and is easy to send from person to person. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 00:06:57
Tell me how segwit can have any effect when it's not being used yet? 
Anybody who thought segwit would be an instant fix is delusional. It was never an instant fix and nobody ever should have thought it was. It's a slow "fix" that isn't even a fix because it isn't enough for what bitcoin is currently needing even if it has 100% segwit usage.
It does however allow for 2nd layer solutions that we should hopefully be seeing roll out in the coming months and years. If you are someone who needs instant cheap transactions daily then yeah bitcoin is fucked for you right now. Hopefully you'll come back later when adoption for this newly activated tech grows but for now use litecoin or something.

Get a job 
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:07:27
The large majority of the hashrate 75-80% will probably switch back. But there is a chance we may not see as many miners as we would like come back. It's also possible bch could rise and btc could fall making profitability nearly the same and we could see a lot of people staying on bch. Who knows though.
@_date: 2017-08-23 15:44:35
No 
@_date: 2017-08-21 20:33:17
Fees are out of control right now, Segwit may relieve some but not all of the mempool pressure. Your btc isn't lost you just have to wait it'll be confirmed at some point. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 00:10:43
@_date: 2017-01-03 01:41:58
What kind of places other than my home would I be able to store my keys?
@_date: 2017-08-23 22:30:54
@_date: 2017-08-26 14:16:45
That's not a lot
@_date: 2017-08-24 14:36:16
Who cares what satoshis bitcoin is? I don't get why this is an argument/talking point. Things can evolve past their original creators vision.
Btc is bitcoin right now bch is not.
If bch ever has the market cap and total work of btc as well as lots of shops accepting it it will be bitcoin.
Doesn't matter what satoshis vision was, he's gone and bitcoin doesn't have a leader so it doesn't matter.
@_date: 2017-01-03 01:47:12
Not sure how that happened
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:34:39
First Segwit transactions will more than likely happen shortly after Segwit activates. Either you're confused and think segwit = LN or you have no idea what you're talking about 
@_date: 2017-08-24 02:32:03
No way to predict this. All depends how fast wallets and exchanges update their stuff. Lots of wallets and exchanges should be ready to launch their updated segwit stuff but we will have to wait and see how fast they update it.
@_date: 2017-08-24 13:12:42
Bch has become more profitable to mine again due to the extremely exploitable eda "feature" also very very few Segwit transactions are currently happening as not many wallets are currently updated to send Segwit transactions. If any price change happens in the next 2-4 days I can really only see it being a dip of 4% or so.
Doesn't mean shit though anything can happen in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-24 17:11:15
Would like to see this to track how fast adoption goes.
@_date: 2017-08-25 00:44:43
No, the odds are it will be used.
@_date: 2017-08-25 00:03:05
How does Asic boost work and how does segwit stop it?
Could you link me an article or something?
@_date: 2017-08-22 13:02:23
1. People have money
2. People raise their fees too match or beat fees of other transactions so they get confirmed first
3. Segwit and LN are solutions that will help with this, hopefully adoption doesn't take too long.
@_date: 2016-11-30 21:32:04
No you're not going to make anything. Check out nicehash though. Really easy to use just download the client benchmark your hardware and start mining. You'll be mining alt currencies like ethereum and zcash but you'll be paid in btc.
@_date: 2016-12-28 23:43:04
Pros: Easier to sell your coins on coinbase
Cons: Just don't do it 
@_date: 2019-10-25 17:49:25
Did you end up buying back in?

I'm 17 so I guess I'm not allowed to use cryptocurrencies

You did not offend buddy, I very much enjoyed the long play, well done. Take care buddy

Just incase you're wrong buddy
@_date: 2019-10-24 05:56:06
Thank you buddy, I am still up 1000% so I'm not sure I'll need that for a while.
@_date: 2019-06-28 20:23:17
How are ya feeling now buddy. Good move
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:20:30
Oh shit
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:58:35
So making sure I understand LN correctly, both parties do not need to consent to closing the channel right? I can decide to close a channel after spending .5 of my 1 btc and I will get .5 back and the the other side of the channel will get their .5 I sent to them. I can do this at any time right?
So the best idea would be to close all my channels before the fork and reopen after the markets and both forks have calmed down.

I know a lot about Bitcoin just don't know how the market has been recently
@_date: 2016-09-19 15:00:17
Don't gotta be an asshole
@_date: 2017-09-11 18:26:13
Instant purchase and 4% fee on coinbase. Convenience is worth a price for some.
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:49:44
cool but this is the bitcoin sub
@_date: 2017-09-11 15:44:28
Yeah its $2 with a credit card so use a credit card
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:25:49
Um wasn't peter schiff just on the joe rogan podcast a month ago or something say btc is bad? I mean good for them but what
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:46:07
Don't know how you expect anyone to believe you
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:26:41
Just go to a btc atm with cash. Download bread on your mobile device.
@_date: 2017-09-24 16:33:23
I'm for segwit but stop lying to yourselves. This isn't segwit. We've been averaging more blocks/hr, spam seems to have stopped for now and theres just less tx's per second in general right now.
@_date: 2017-10-19 20:39:53
This is just a stupid question
@_date: 2016-10-12 15:36:39
How do I export my keys? Like my recovery key? Kinda new to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-10-12 15:46:24
I tried to log in with the mobile app before I knew about the hack. Just my 4 digit passcode, could this cause problems?
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:39:16
It's gone
@_date: 2017-07-22 21:04:06
Yeah not taking the chance of having my coins locked up until December 31st
@_date: 2017-07-22 17:22:37
"After UAHF activates at 12:20 1st August 2017 (UTC time), all your “BTC_FROZEN2” asset will be redeemed back to your “BTC” asset"
So what if it never activates? Yeah no way I'm putting my bitcoin in there. The way they wrote that allows them to not unfreeze your bitcoin if bcc ends up not existing on august 1st.
@_date: 2017-07-29 22:45:07
I'm currently using bread wallet and mycelium. And as far as I know the mycelium recovery seed will allow me to get my bcc but I'm not 100% sure. Also from what I remember the breadwallet seed only allows me to recover onto bread wallet so I should move my coins to mycelium.
Are there any other safe mobile wallets on iPhone that will 100% guarantee me access to my bcc? I don't like desktop wallets I just feel like with my browsing habits there may be a a virus that I never noticed and I'm just not comfortable using it to store my btc. I also don't have access to a printer for a paper wallet.
