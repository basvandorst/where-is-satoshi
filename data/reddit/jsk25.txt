Won't pass because the majority of the Swiss people don't really have an idea how economics work. Too spoilt from the seamlessly infinite wealth here I guess.
Edit: But thanks for reminding me to vote lol

In Switzerland you get taught at school (*Highschool) that the public bank ONLY can print money here and that's simply not true. Many people here don't even really have an idea where money comes from or how inflation / deflation happens. Private banks shouldn't have that kind of control, because they operate for the sake of maximizing their own profit, while the public bank of Switzerland (SNB) is here to be benefitial for the country as whole. Also the corruption at Raiffeisen is terrifying, but yeah let private banks have such a big responsibility like being able to print money and fondle with a countrys economy in big fashion, that worked out well in the past right?
But yeah I'm sure you have a degree in marcoecnomics or something like that with "98" in your username telling me that I have no idea about economics in my own country from one statement.

Inflation itself isn‘t a bad thing, I’d go as far as to say that it‘s crucial for a economy for increase in production. Also if there‘s a big inflation the people with assets don‘t get „richer“. Yes the worth in dollars of houses etc goes up, but so do the average salaries, so it equals itself out. The losers in this scenario are people who hold large amouts of liquid money instead of investing it.

Well the public bank belongs to Switzerland only and its purpose is to serve the citizens of Switzerland, while UBS, Raiffeisen and other private banks are here to make profit for themselves.
