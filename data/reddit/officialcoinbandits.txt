Bandit under the hood is data science that is meant for investors as a risk management tool primarily.
why would we share the knowledge, we get asked that all the time... we aren't greedy and like building and sharing things. We also believe that there is a big opportunity to do things right, especially in crypto. 
Taking a risk putting it out there, but if we can achieve our goals, everyone wins. 
Check out the app its free... we also have a live tracker that we just set up and have a $250 Bitcoin giveaway you can track here... right now Bandit is 100% Tether and sold at $10,150, current Bitcoin price $7,935.

It's connected to Binance with an API that we can't control outside of actual trades in the exchange.
We don't think we can be much more transparent at this stage and we would be skeptical as well.

We are taking a statistical approach to manage the risk and capture the upside... we just avoided avoided 20%+ loss which is very difficult to recover from. Catching a falling kn!fe as they call it in investing lingo. Have fun for sure... that is key.

Not pointless at all, but will post from Jan 2018 as well. Bandit just avoided the 20% drop in Bitcoin... come take a look voodoodog... [

Voodoodog, the green grey is the result of a data science model in the Azure cloud that analyses Bitcoin in real-time... and works so well that we can't beat it as professional accredited investors. We are making tools like this for a new generation looking for tech to help with investing... if you're a pro investor, Bandit is ready for a challenge.. think you can beat him?

Bandit might trade once a month, and we watch the price all the time anyways, so might as well do a little risk management along the way. IMHO
