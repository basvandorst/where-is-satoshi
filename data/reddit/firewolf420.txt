You make $30/day mining? I'm assuming you're mining in a pool?

I had that happen to me too, I nearly gave up but they got to me in the second week. Just be patient. They were one of the few verification processes that actually works, and Gemini is a fantastic exchange

I really want to use this but it's not compatible with my old android operating system

Still, it's just a matter of 'when' not 'if'

You don't think we should prepare at all for the inevitability? I would say that the breaking of SHA256 will happen much sooner than the death of our sun. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:35:03
Technically SHA-256 can very well be damaged from quantum computing. It is far from impenetrable. Just look at what happened to MD5, everyone thought that was super-secure, and that one at least didn't have hundreds upon hundreds of thousands of dollars riding on it. The second SHA-256 breaks (and it WILL happen it's just a matter of WHEN) it'll be a very interesting day for crypto. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:55:04
I ain't sayin' SHA-256 is weak or weaker relative to anything, just that it's not infallible and it's only a matter of time before we'll have to move to a new algorithm. 
This is pretty widely accepted knowledge throughout the cryptography community: the hashing algorithms we use today are temporary.  
It might not even be quantum computing that is the nail in the cryptographic coffin, but it's certainly looking to be.

Congrats, dude. I wish I was you. I have been following bitcoin for years now. Back when it was like $100, before the first bubble burst and everyone was flipping shit about $500 to $200 change (BITCOIN IS DEAD OH NOES). I remember the Mt. GOX fiasco. All that shit. 
I never bought in. I fuckin joined a mining pool back then, then pulled out because I would "*only*" be getting 0.005 BTC a day from it. Fucking IDIOT I was. There's not a day I don't regret that shit. 
I mean, realistically I never lost any... but getting in now at the $15K mark is really making me feel like a chump... why the fuck didnt I just stick like $100 in... seriously..
Ugh. Anyways, congrats dude.

I really really really *really* hope you're right about that. But if that's the case, that'll make the literal hundreds of thousands of current bitcoin holders millionaires. Where's all that money going to come from? Surely there's not that much value in the coin. 
I see it going to $100K, and capping out, max.

Shhhhh let em make drama it helps us get those sweet sweet lows
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:38:31
Man, maybe its a good thing I didn't get in on that market then. Sheesh! I didn't realize the Mt. Gox stuff was still an issue!
@_date: 2018-02-22 08:19:51
Alright EVERYBODY LETS WORK TOGETHER HERE
BITCOIN IS NOW WORTH A MILLION DOLLARS
dont sell for anything less!
Who's with me!

"True believers" really startin to make me smell snake oil
