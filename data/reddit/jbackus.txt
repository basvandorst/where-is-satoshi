Hey I'm the friend mentioned in the post.  Feel free to ask Alain or me about the service, the API, the verification process, etc.  We're more than happy to provide explanations and examples.
**Edit:** Folks I've chatted with off of reddit recommended elaborating on some of the details mentioned in this post like KYC requirements and API usage.  I'll elaborate on these topics in replies to this comment.

Know Your Customer (KYC)
Definition and Requirements
"Know your customer" is the term for the general legal requirements for financial institutions and companies to gather information about the people using their service to prevent "identity theft, financial fraud, money laundering and terrorist financing."^[[1]]( These requirements vary depending on the type of service a company is providing, but as an example in the United States:^[[2]](














So any financial institution in the United States is legally obligated to record:
















and take sufficient measures to ensure that the information customers submit are valid
Traditionally "document verification and authentication should be commensurate with the level of AML risk"^[[3]]( but this method is more complicated and risky with 100% online services (remember these regulations were being introduced as early as the 1970s).  Verification methods more reasonable for the internet exist, but using them is fairly capital intensive (significant sunk costs and marginal costs) and the interfaces for dealing with these verification options are fairly outdated.^[[4]]( As a result companies are either risking document verification in digital services or investing significant company resources into alternative verification avenues.
KYC and Bitcoin
Bitcoin is obviously closely intertwined with the fiat currencies these laws aim to regulate.  Today a lot of these regulations have  plagued Bitcoin companies with account freezes^[[5]]( and sadly some shutdowns^[[6]](  Handling KYC internally can be very capital intensive, time intensive




and risky on top of that (not to mention the impact to user experience that a 10 day waiting period can have).  
We think that KYC is too big of a time sink, capital investment, and risk for every single Bitcoin company to take on by themselves alongside all the day-to-day responsibilities of running the company itself.  We think that companies should be able to add a few lines of code to their application and let us handle verification so that they can spend their time improving their products and making the bitcoin ecosystem better without risking account freezes and service shutdowns!

We started doing identity verification and anti-fraud after having issues with it in the past when working with Bitcoin. Right now we work with Bitcoin companies, we're working on Bitcoin specific anti-fraud measures (improving conversion rates in the bitcoin demographic), and we're developing Bitcoin specific IP exploring risk analysis and greenlisting (can't speak too much more publicly about it now).

BlockScore API Usage
*Note: This might be a bit technical if you aren't a developer*
Our API accepts verification information from participating companies and responds with a verification id and status.  Because most verifications will not be instantaneous (for example limits on Government services and internal review/sanity checks) we update companies via a [webhook](  To fully integrate BlockScore into your service all you really need to do is 
1. add methods for creating and editing new customer verifications, and 
2. designate a route on your website that accepts POST requests (webhook verification updates)
We have already built out libraries for handling verification creation in Javascript and Ruby for our current users in the private beta, we have a PHP library in the works, and we're more than happy to build out other libraries for companies that join the private beta and use other languages in the application stack.
Creating a Verification (cURL)
A common method of verification (as mentioned in my [KYC]( explanation) is name, address, date of birth, and SSN. The raw cURL request would look like this:
    curl  \
        -u sk_live_3c02766aaeeec5b486f99879c4b2a821: \
        -d "verification[type]=U.S. Citizen" \
        -d "verification[name][first]=Satoshi" \
        -d "verification[name][last]=Nakamoto" \
        -d "verification[ssn]=273-86-6524" \
        -d "verification[date_of_birth]=1984-01-01" \
        -d "verification[address][street1]=2675 Bitcoin Ln" \
        -d "verification[address][city]=Palo Alto" \
        -d "verification[address][state]=CA" \
        -d "verification[address][postal_code]=94301" \
        -d "verification[address][country]=USA"
        
and would yield a response that looked like:
    {
        "id": "51f5b51f8fcf0e4d59000001",
        "created_at": 1376629177006,
        "updated_at": 1376629177006,
        "type": "U.S. Citizen",
        "livemode": true,
        "status": "pending",
        "ssn": "273-86-6524",
        "date_of_birth": "1984-01-01",
        "name": {
            "first": "Satoshi",
            "middle": "",
            "last": "Nakamoto"
        },
        "address": {
            "street1": "2675 Bitcoin Ln",
            "street2": "",
            "city": "Palo Alto",
            "state": "CA",
            "postal_code": "94301",
            "country": "USA"
        }
    }
    
Creating a Verification (Javascript)
Creating the same request with Javascript in Node.JS would look like:
    blockscore.verifications.create({
      verification: {
        type: "U.S. Citizen",
        date_of_birth: '1984-01-01',
        ssn: "273-86-6524",
        address: {
          street1: "2675 Bitcoin Ln",
          city: "Palo Alto",
          state: "CA",
          postal_code: "94301",
          country: "United States"
        },
        name: {
          first: "Satoshi",
          last: "Nakamoto"
        }
      }
    }, handleNewVerificationCallback);
    
where `handleNewVerificationCallback` is an application defined method for handling the creation response from our server and storing the verification id, status, and whatever else you view relevant in your database. 
Verification Results
Verification results come back from the webhook in JSON and provides a `verification_id`, `status`, and `reason`.  The `reason` embeds a `reason` `id`, the `name` designated for the reason, and a `description` of the reason the verification was found to be valid or invalid.  An example verification result from the verification we created above would be:
    {
        "verification_id": "51f5b51f8fcf0e4d59000001",
        "status": "invalid",
        "reason": {
            "id": 3,
            "name": "ssn_invalid",
            "description": "The given SSN could not be found \
            in the US Governments' databases and was unable \
            to be verified."
        }
    }
Viewing and Managing Verifications
On top of being able to create, read, update, and delete verifications via the API we also give you an easy to use dashboard for viewing verification statistics and managing results.  If you're curious you can checkout this [screenshot from our test account](
That about covers the core of the API!  If you have any questions feel free to ask.

Shoot!  Thank you for the heads up.  It should be fixed now.  Bitremit was a service we were building out earlier this year that introduced us to the Know your Customer headaches we're trying to fix now.  We've since shifted all of our focus from Bitremit to BlockScore but it looks like Mailchimp doesn't let you change some mailing list settings without creating an entirely new account.


Glad to hear it! Maybe we'll make a guide for transitioning from IDology to BlockScore then :)


I agree.  We're working on that feature now actually. 
@_date: 2013-08-16 02:10:01
We're starting off by focusing on the verification processes that companies are required to do by law because it's a common headache for new Bitcoin companies.  Eventually we want to have a more thorough verification &amp; evaluation process and that will mean incorporating information gathered from the Blockchain.  Make more sense?

Great job guys!
