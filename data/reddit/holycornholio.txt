Ugh don't remind me brother.
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:57:51
Congrats on simply being lucky.
I wish I had done the same but hey I'll take my small profits.
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:15:43
You're an idiot.
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:01:15
And I should have boughten then and not now haha
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:55:28
I'm down $16 dollars rn, would be up if I didn't buy past 14,4 but it is what it is my dude.
HODL 90K BY SUMMER!!!! WE CAN ONLY HOPE
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:35:31
Amen brotha.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:52:51
Way to attempt* 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:39:46
I don't care if I lose all $175, my point is, I'm laughing at myself for buying in once Bitcoin seems to actually be decreasing somewhat in value rather than the jumps from 2k to 4 to 6k is all.
HODL is the motto, I'm sure it will continue to increase eventually, I just think it's funny I messed up every way possible, by means of when I bought in, and not buying lite coin when I should have.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:58:40
I think you need to go read my comments on this thread lmao. 
Y'all are pretty dumb for acting like I know it isn't going to go back up and that I just want to laugh that I buy in while its lowering.
hey, if you didn't know, HODL.
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:22:32
Does anyone know why suddenly btc, LTC, and eth are now suddenly stable?
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:00:47
**please be right**
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:37:38
Read my other comments since the point of the post went over your head like a lot of things I can only assume :)
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:40:46
Someone had a bad day awwwwwww ;)
Took you awhile but you finally dusted off those reading comprehension skills
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:08:15
What's your thought on vert coin and iota?
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:17:23
Ps: I am only $175 in but I didn't expect to lose money haha
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:36:56
Good point, and perspective. Not worrying about the money itself, but just laughing at my own lil misfortune of when I bought in is all. :)
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:55:55
Here is your prize sir
A gold medal for placing first in mental gymnastics from the special olympics. 
Lmao, READING COMPREHENSION MOTHA FUCKA, DO YOU HAVE IT?
^ that's a pulp fiction joke since a lot has gone over your head already.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:23:48
"And I'm losing money" when I lost money.
And I even put a smiley face. Hahahaa what weakly construed point are you attempting to make again?
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:39:03
Bro I'm still waiting lmao. "You already did"
So I already did what then?
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:18:11
Look at that obsession.
Aspbergers confirmed. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:43:51
Absolutely, but what I had meant to say was I didn't expect to immediately invest and then for the first time in awhile, BTC is actually lowering rather than averaging out after a price jump. 
Like I'm talking about when it was 2k, to 4K, to 6k in less than a month.  I'm just laughing now at my own misery in timing when to buy in is all. Have a good one!
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:43:47
You don't have to :)
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:22:52
That's nice :) 
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:09:50
Yeah I'm only $175 deep. At the moment.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:40:03
Pulls your panties out of your smelly pussy and stop crying
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:24:19
Brush up on the reading comprehension my dude. Have a good night :)
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:36:12
Not the point of the post btw. Just my shitty timing of when to buy in is what I thought was funny.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:35:07
The point of the post was to laugh at my timing, I used to have some coin in 2011, used them on SR.
Almost invested at 2k, 4k, next I know it's 14,8 then I invest and it finally starts to lower after months of climbing.
Neither $80 nor $175 is making me anxious or freak out/panic. It's just my luck haha
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:48:40
Different strokes for different folks.
In my opinion, yeah I fucked up when I probably should've taken that entire $175 and put it into iota, or litecoin.
But that's hindsight talking, all in all nothing is a huge deal. I'm not hurting for not even $200.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:26:12
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:14:54
What the fuck are you smoking dumbass? I still have all the coin I've had since I bought in my first day lol. Brush up on your reading comprehension and get some vagisil dude, too fishy. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:13:16
Can you explain futures to me? Lol
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:00:43
So no one can dictate the price being sold or bought for coin right? It's still just the current value of coin correct ?
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:16:46
I fucking love when retards jump into a situation of their own making to show off their lack of intelligence.
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:54:37
I always think of it as "hold on don't lose" 
Because I saw a joke on here that said "you win if you die before you sell"
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:59:12
The only actually shitty part is people like me who bought in at 14,4, and 15,8. 
I wouldn't be bummed at all if I bought in and still had any gains, I'm in the negative now but i won't be for long!!
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:45:56
I am no where near worried of losing $175 lmao. 
Hear that? That's the sound of the intent of my post whirring over your head. Read my comments I've posted in the thread if you need more hand holdin'
Peace 
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:57:03
Thank you!!
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:46:10
Oh boy look at this yummy projection!!!
Gonna call me a cuck next big boy?? 
I love how salty and triggered you're acting because of this post. Hahahaha :)
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:59:08
Just don't comment bro, it isn't for you.
Same logic there ^
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:07:45
54% BTC 45% LTC
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:57:47
Thank you!!
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:20:58
I'll wait for you to show me where I called you a cuck �� 
I'm starting to think you have a mental disability at this point. 
Bro I've said it once I'll say it again, brush up on that reading comprehension haha
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:44:51
You're an imbecile. And I like the assumption but try harder bud :) 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:42:12
Worried to lose the $175? Not really. All of my bills and etc aren't dependent on not losing that. I would've bought weed with it or something anyways.
Just thought my timing is funny, and my luck in not buying litecoin
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:10:23
How so? I'm not worried that i won't be able to "pay my bills" with that measly $175 but of course like anyone would want it to, I was hoping it would climb like Bitcoin has been climbing since July.
And I have lost $16 so far so my title is correct, not click bait.
I think YOU made the assumption I was devastated and now try to call my post click bait? K my dude haha
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:26:11
can anyone explain bittrex to me like I'm 5??
Like what does "bid" mean and how do buy and sell walls work. Am I buying peer to peer or selling peer to peer? 
@_date: 2018-04-24 03:18:40
So if a business model of a corporation/bank/whatthefuckever is to systemically rip people off in prime cases to where they will face no repercussions through terms of service and legal loopholes, and people speak out against it, it’s just ALL anecdotal evidence to you? 
@_date: 2018-04-23 21:34:06
You are THE WORST type of redditor. Shush
