Someday, crypto investors will start wanting real results before gifting multi billion dollar market caps lol. Apparently not yet though. They are too into getting suckered by scammy projects.
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:19:40
This is what people do should. Take profits, buy coins back lower. If you think a downtrend has begun this is the smart move. If you are wrong then you lose money, if you are right you don't. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 12:26:23
Made you mad to mention it. Plus you're the one who said plenty of new people in crypto who don't know anything. :)
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:17:24
Just because it's up 17% doesn't mean this hype cycle isn't coming to an end and we have begun the downtrend. It took a long time to rise, it would take a long time to fall as well, with many ups and drops along the way.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:27:04
This sounds like my story lol. It's important with any investment to treat it like one. I see so many people treating crypto like the casino, read white papers, invest in ideas that scream potential to you. Quit chasing the pumps, doin that may work well in the short term but it's not how life changing wealth comes about, at least not for most. People also need to get into a better mental space..never feel bad to realize profits on success. Around here I see the mentality of "missing out on gains" so so much. Remember everyone a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, especially if you can get your self to a point of completely having removed your initial investment costs. 
That's where your gains truly become life changing, because you have the opportunity to invest money you made from smart decisions. If you keep looking for longer term potential and seeking value rather then spectacle, you can really do well... Even in a volatile market like we have here.

@_date: 2018-01-18 23:10:40
Lightning isn't secure at all and it never will be. If you want a secure transaction, send a regular BTC transaction. Lightning is about speed, not security.
@_date: 2018-01-31 13:39:38
The same will happen to most cryptos. But the tech seems interesting, so BTC and a few others will survive.

You already know why BTC. Front runner, most developers, lightning network coming, mainstream adoption, all other cryptos reliant on it for their success.
I'd like you to explain why not. Other then expensive transaction fees, and not a great currency (due to high valuation).

Europe will Shun GB, they have to. They need to make an example out of you. Nobody in Europe will increase their imports from GB, as to do so would invite more countries to leave the block.
You will get one sided trade deals with the Americans, further worsening your economic situation. More and more and more businesses will begin to flee Britain for the safer Euro block countries. (Germany will truly prosper because of Brexit, so too will southern Ireland).
Nothing good will come from Brexit. The fact that you think everything is going to be fine, is laughable. Buy Bitcoin, or gold, or something.

Runaway inflation is bad, some inflation is not necessarily bad. I always cringe at posts like this, because the comments will also show how ignorant people are in the bitcoin community.

Just more opportunities for people to be driven away.

@_date: 2018-09-02 20:40:55
You personally? I'd mind. As you are not the condiut for economic growth. I'm fine with inflation devaluing my worth as it drives me to be able to accumulate more. 
Taxation is also theft, however I'm okay with paying them too, as they pay for the social constructs upon which my ability to acquire wealth is dependant.
Your argument is based on flawed thinking. You must be a libertarian.
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:02:55
You must pay capital gains when you buy something. That doesn't protect you from taxes.
@_date: 2018-09-22 12:11:28

Yep, its the reason why chinese exchanges have such crazy volume. The actual volume of coins exchanging hands on those exchanges is likely 5-10% of the reported volume.
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:52:47
The exchanges have records of all of this. You just need to download the trade data. It's usually in csv format too.
@_date: 2015-12-25 17:14:39
Trading on there is fuelled by bots since there aren't trade fees (IIRC) so bots just trade coins back and forth constantly, drastically inflating the volume.
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:27:32
Like kind is basically gone with the new tax bill or so I read. They added specificarions. To when it can  be applied.
@_date: 2015-12-25 17:05:16
I'm probably too late, but maybe not? 
It would be nice for bitcoin in 2016, if some legitimate third party service came forward, that would ensure peoples coins so some of the responsibility of use would be taken out of the hands of the average user. That IMO would really spur adoption.
Merry Christmas anyway.

@_date: 2015-12-20 19:30:37
It blows my mind that people think that the "future of money" is going to give people all of the responsibility of caring for it. The average person just doesn't have the time or interest to do that. The fact that there are no trustable third party's for bitcoin are just one of its many drawbacks.
@_date: 2015-12-30 00:08:48
Well more people use USD to buy drugs than BTC. So its what ever.
@_date: 2015-12-14 01:52:45
Any time you think the developers of bitcoin are smarter than you , stop, think and ask questions. They are no smarter than any other intelligent people. Hopefully we are all among the group of people in the world who are intelligent. 
The developers are not omnipotent beings, they are capable of making bad decisions and implementing bad ideas just as easily as anyone else.
@_date: 2018-08-14 17:22:46
Well this is unequivocally false. Some alts have usecases Bitcoin is unsuited for (like steem with steemit). There is room for more than one block chain in the Bitcoin ecosystem. In fact it's stupid not to welcome it, because it's a main driver in value for Bitcoin as well.
@_date: 2015-12-20 19:27:19

No it will continue to rise substantially, even without a lot more users 
@_date: 2015-12-16 01:05:20
I have historically tried to trade BTC inorder to get them with no cost basis. If I have no "money" put into BTC, but hold BTC. I consider that a win. If BTC becomes worthless, I haven't lost anything (other than potential gains), but I am willing to take that risk, considering the potential of the technology.
@_date: 2018-08-20 18:52:38
Ironically though, as the article points out, what Bernie defines as "socialist" is what Denmark has. Seems more like Bernie doesn't know what socialism is.

@_date: 2018-08-14 17:25:26
This, and it's why alt coins which attempt to solve different and unique problems that Bitcoin is unsuited for, are interesting. A lot of what people buy is garbage, BUT there are alts worth holding and will grow over time.
@_date: 2018-08-14 18:06:31
One can have a token of value and not intend to be money. 
I did not read incorrectly, you are just thinking too narrowly. Block chain technology (a distributed ledger) can have more applications than Bitcoin. It will too. You should be hopeful that those things succeed as they will further drive the establishment of the space as a whole.
@_date: 2014-02-17 14:38:43
This is true, but much like any technology, once you get the hang of it, it becomes intuitive.

Paid 170 for that exact card new, I certainly wouldn't pay over 120 for a used one.
However I like to search for situation where I feel I am overwhelmingly getting the better part of the deal. So selling to me wouldn't likely be in your best interest. I'm sure someone else would be willing to pay much more than I would.
@_date: 2014-05-27 01:21:28
I don't know what this author is talking about. The decrease in price from the all time highs allowed for more "average joes" to acquire bitcoin. Most people I know have been getting into it more recently, and none of these people are wealthy, they are just your regular people.
@_date: 2014-02-27 13:07:57
Sounds like denial me.
@_date: 2014-03-25 18:58:43

It's more like they don't really know what bitcoin is. When you mention bitcoin to people and they reply "oh yeah I have heard of bitcoin, what is it?" It's not like they don't care, they aren't even informed enough to know to care.
@_date: 2018-05-17 19:13:04
It didn't apply at all to the subject at hand. Zionist in the above image is used in an anti Jewish racist context. It's a racist dragon, and many here talk similarly, though I doubt they even recognize what they are saying. 
We're one to use Zionist in a standard contest of discussing people who want to build and protect a Jewish home state, that would be totally cool.

Mt.Gox had been steadily losing its influence as time went on. originally it accounted for 90% of all bitcoins traded, but year after year they screwed things up, as of lately, even prior to withdrawals being halted and all that business, its share of the trading transactions was much less more around 8%. This leads me to question how great its influence really was, sure some, but not much more than any of the other large exchanges.
@_date: 2014-05-20 18:16:47
Eventually sure, I'm still long term bullish on BTC, the technology is still very cool. I could easily see it returning to $1000 in time. I just don't believe in this current blip.

Doubt it. Everyone I know with coins in Gox or fiat, had the following plans. Safely store any coins they got back, Take any fiat and immediately buy BTC with it and safely store it. I don't know anyone who wanted to sell.

It's unfortunate that Bitcoin was coded by humans, and humans are not perfect. There will always be issues, the speed and urgency at which those issues are corrected sets apart success from failure.

If you're insinuating thats Gox.. I do believe you are mistaken. 
Do some research and determine where you feel is a reputable location to make a purchase. If thats Gox, then keep in mind I'm just a random person on the internet, with an opinion and a personal assessment of risk. Our opinions may not be the same.

Well, it's comparing apples and oranges. Investing in BTC at the outset was at the time extremely risky. Investing in birkshire not so much. So of course the returns on the risky investment can be insane.
@_date: 2014-04-11 12:48:29
You can't, just talk to your so tell him/her what you think the investment should be worth, and explain that you could be wrong and you may lose. That's risk/reward in investing I guess. You may or may not come out on top. Your so just has to trust your judgement.

Technically you are correct, when people refer to BTC being a currency, what they actually mean, is it is a "Money." I think the best descriptor for what it is, is "Commodity Money." As its a commodity that is accepted and exchanged for common goods and services.

The Chinese exchanges still have about 60 or more % of the bitcoin volume, so they really do still have a pretty good hold on control of the price. However what you said is absolutely true, and bitcoin would go on with the chinese out of the picture entirely.

Things don't even need to be audited, we just need to create a minimum standard that all exchanges can apply. It seems like even having basic, well written security protocols in place would be a huge help.
Your idea of a community wide demand that exchanges take our security seriously, is absolutely commonsense, however most people just aren't demanding it. Sometimes the best ideas, are staring you right in the face and you just don't notice them. We really need to start encouraging people to get away from exchanges that aren't serious enough. Maybe we need to start compiling a list of exchanges that are taking things seriously, and keeping security in mind, and place that in the sidebar. To help everyone choose somewhere that isn't going to be a huge red flag risk wise, just to deposit money into.

I will give you that on MtGox, and with USD the first real peak was the largest relative to its value at the time. But BTC is becoming more world wide now than it was at that time. The pattern doesn't hold for its value in other currencies.

Bitcoin will not be successful if it is dependent on people buying it. The only way this will ever work the way people want it to is if people start getting paid their wage in BTC. 
Your logic is flawed. Coinbase's increased revenue will come from being a payment processor. With more people spending the btc they earn for their wage.
@_date: 2014-03-31 02:14:47
Well the IRS rules weren't stated until recently, so of course from here on out you should be keeping track of every purchase you make: the amount and the value of bitcoin at the time of purchase.
I don't think the IRS is taxing bitcoins you hold, only ones you spend. When you mine the bitcoin in the eyes of the IRS i believe the whole value you sell for counts toward capital gains. So you will be paying tax on the entire purchase.
What you need to do is just keep careful records. When the end of 2014 rolls around, so long as you kept good records you will have the necessary information to be able to show what ever you need to.

Different cryptos are like different metals. You can keep proposing using other metals, but people really only like to use a few, precious metals, as currency.

Bitcoin just really needs to hold its value at or around current levels for a while. It needs to be able to demonstrate stability. It also needs to be spread out more. The more people that are using/invested in bitcoin, the more stable it will be. The more stable it is, the more it will be used for the purchase and exchange of goods. Those things will bolster its value.

You are defending the use case of the term "Zionist banking system". Zionist in this case does not refer to a person who aspires to found and protect a Jewish nation state, but rather is being used as a racist slur (see anti semitism) against Jewish people. 
Pretend to be smart all you want, however you are in the wrong. So are most people in this thread. Though I suspect as I have said elsewhere they don't even realize the context of this term in this case or what it actually means. Perhaps you fall into that category as well.

Coinbase is different from Mt.Gox. However you still shouldn't store your coins there. It is just a place to purchase them, they don't even charge you fees for transferring them somewhere else, so I don't know why anyone would ever keep their coins in Coinbase.

Gox was the biggest yeah, for a long time. However they have continuously proved them selves to be the weak link in the bitcoin ecosystem. When ever problems arise, you can almost be guaranteed that Gox will either be involved or the root cause somehow, unfortunately.
I use a simple MultiBit wallet for storage on my PC, I do not use webwallets as I just do not trust them... perhaps I should, but I don't.
As far as an exchange Bitstamp, while not perfect, does seem to keep their users abreast of issues, fix them in a timely fashion, and provide updates when indicated. The best exchange right now, it's probably kracken honestly, however they just don't have the volume that many of the other exchanges have.
If you live in the US and you just want to purchase bitcoin, not actively trade... just use coinbase, longer wait times, but reliable, and fairly un-intrusive.
Hope this helps.

A small altcoin, that revolves around holding, and possession generated interest. 1% Annual. With no coin cap, so its a 1% per annum inflationary alt.

yes, but this happened just once ever. The phrase on any given day means it is likely to occur at any time.

Plenty of mandarin speakers are here, and translated documents along the way for everyone.

This is my point, he can't do it do bitcoin. he cant even do it to smaller alt coins anymore. The bigger the market cap, the harder it is for players to play with the market. Also as they play the market their coins get distributed to more and more people, further stabilizing the market. its not a problem with bitcoin itself, its not even a problem really, as its quite natural for a commodity growing in value. This sort of thing happens to anything with a smaller market cap, where it is easy to manipulate value with a moderate sum of money.
actually the only way you can view this as a problem, is if you are only in it for short term monetary gain, and those types of people are completely against the spirit of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 22:58:48

When I was young and in high school I was told not to pursue a career in science (despite finding science interesting), I chose to do so anyway. Guidance counselors, teachers, my family, nobody was very supportive, as I had historically not done particularly well. I am currently putting the finishing touches on my dissertation and defending my PhD in a month or two. Do the opposite of what you are told. Nobody but you knows what you are capable of.
I could technically provide research examples, however they would probably not be understandable when taken out of context. The long story short from there is, just because someone tells you something isn't worth your time to look into, if you really think it is, you likely see something everyone else is missing. 
Investing is trickier, I usually look for situations where I feel something is just undervalued, and people are yelling that the sky is falling. I have invested in the wasteland that is penny stocks (with comparatively small amounts of money) and fairly regularly come out on top. The more people nay say, the less bad things usually are. 
Bitcoin is something I feel has incredible potential, I wasn't into it before I started reading about the technology and really coming to understand what it is. I used to think it was dumb, and not worth anyone's time. I was one of them. Naysaying because I didn't understand. I started doing my own research, and decided that I was wrong. 
The louder people yell something is dumb, the more wrong they usually are. If it was really dumb, they wouldn't care to yell in the first place.

Unfortunately this is entirely dependent on the supply being determined by the whole "Bitcoin" I really think this whole argument actually only matters when you do not have infinitely divisible units. Supply matters with physical dollars as you can not technically get a physical unit smaller than .01 so we need to inflate the supply to keep the value constant as a currency.
Edit: And yes you could make the argument, that you have infinite decimal places with dollars too, but you are always constrained by the physical units, so in reality while those decimal places are there, you can't change the main unit as the physical dollar bill, will always be 1 dollar, you can only increase supply by literally releasing more. 
Here with bitcoin things are slightly different, as there are no physical units. The supply can technically be infinitely inflated, as we are not constrained by physical unit limitations. All you need to do is move the decimal place and make the unit of transaction, decibitcoin then we have 120 million units, or milli bitcoin, then in circulation there are 12 Billion units. In reality this is no different than releasing dollars into circulation, it is just a change in perspective.
Edit: I think the problem lies in trying to apply the old Fiat paradigm to Bitcoin, where the rules are fundamentally changed due to the removal of the constraints of physicality.

I guess one idea is that Bitcoin is a great wealth transfer mechanism with the block chain, but coinkite serves as a means to allow that wealth transfer system to be used quickly in a currency format. If coins are loaded onto the card, then they could be transferred around by the coinkite system off the blockchain, thus payment could be made with out need for confirmations.
Edit: I don't know how coinkite works, so if they aren't doing something like this, I don't see how a 0 confirmation transaction would be okay. Trying to research.

You are correct in your depictions of how inflation works. I understand it, however inflation is only necessary because we have physical units for currency, and they can not be further subdivided with out creating entire new physical units. Rather than doing that, we inflate the amount of the units available through minting, to keep the value. Deflationary items do not work as currencies because they become impossible to obtain or use as the cost quickly becomes exponentially too high. However here that limitation is no longer a problem, as there are technically infinite divisions into which bitcoin can be subdivided. There is no need to inflate, to keep value constant, you can just use a smaller division for that same purpose.
If we didn't inflate we would run into problems where .01 isnt small enough, and would have to create new smaller denominations of currency, however that would get cumbersome, as there would be an increasing number of physical objects to represent these different smaller denominations. To circumvent that, we inflate the currency to keep the value constant.

Its not an insulting amount because the tipping is not about the dollar value, its just about the dogecoins. They are silly. Technically I feel they should be worth absolutely nothing, and if they were, the tipping would have the same value in my mind. Its something fun. Like an upvote.
Edit: No, if I were at a party and liked what someone said, I wouldn't give them any money. I would probably smile, or laugh, like any normal person. You shouldn't expect monetary reward for saying cool stuff. Being recognized should be reward enough.
TL;DR: Stop being so serious. Life is way too short for everything to be all serious. We already have other serious cryptos worth serious money, that can be tipped for that purpose. Dogecoin is pure and simple for fun, not profit.

They are still accepting bitcoins as a means for transfer of wealth, which makes it money. It's just to volatile still for merchants to keep, and also not everywhere accepts it, ie.. the merchant cant  pay their electric bill in BTC yet, or gas bill, etc... if they could, that would provide added incentive to keep the BTC and not convert back to dollars.
Baby steps. The conversion back to dollars doesn't mean that BTC isn't money. It is being used as money in some places, therefore it is difficult to define exactly what BTC is... right now.

Great question, i dunno the answer to it though, if i had an investment crystal ball, i would be so rich, lol. Do you have confidence in bitcoin? yes? Then its a good time. no? Probably not a good time. Don't take investment advice from me though, im just a random internet stranger.
@_date: 2014-02-26 15:10:50
Mtgox already has the clearances to trade fiat to btc from multiple different currencies. Buying the company would allow someone to inherit those clearances maybe? Which would save a lot of time and effort when trying to set up an exchange.

@_date: 2014-02-28 13:34:20
I was being sarcastic, the technology is as strong as it ever was. If bitcoin is to become a mainstream currency, these struggles (like the gox debacle) are inevitable occurrences. If you had hope for a bright future before (because of the technology), then that should remain unchanged. If it has, then you were a false believer before. Gox is not bitcoin. The people who lost money in gox, lost it of their own fault, for not heeding the warnings about gox, prevalent here for the past year or more.

You know, this shouldn't be all about the price. Bitcoin might provide the Argentinean people with a less volatile currency (I have a hard time typing that BTC is less volatile than anything...but gosh the peso is not stable at all these days.) or at least a way to get their money out of the control of their GVT which is one of the reasons why I like BTC.
@_date: 2014-07-22 15:47:47

The best thing would not be to kill Gox, but rather to slowly let it wither up and die. When ever withdrawls are re-opened up people need to slowly move their coins to other exchanges. Allowing the volume of exchange on gox to slowly come to a halt, rather than driving the price down.

People could use this if zero confirmation transactions are allowable:

China has never driven the price, and their exchange volume is primarily bots trading back and forth with no trade fees. As proof look at the volume on btcchina before and after they instituted a small trade fee. Went from very high to very low. You could say their users moved to another exchange, but I doubt that, the inflation of the volume due to bot trading just stopped.
The price of BTC is controlled by the US markets. Always has been. May not always be in the future, but that's how I see it now.
@_date: 2014-03-02 13:56:42
That's a silly question. There isn't anyway to know, it's like asking how can you be sure of anyone's intentions but your own? You can't be sure it's impossible to know. Okay so you live in Argentina. Great, use coinmelon but learn from the gox situation and don't store large amounts of your coins there! That will ensure they don't become another gox. Don't let them keep 300 million in cold storage. Gox got to be as bad as it was because people used them like a bank rather than an exchange. If you have more coins than you use for trading... Get them the heck out of the exchange.

Well you can't go to a store and pay for goods or services by handing them your laptop, however you are beginning to be able to do so with bitcoin. This makes bitcoin "money" as opposed to just a straight commodity.
Edit: ...and yes I understand that not all places accept bitcoin, however the fact that even some do, indicates the transition to the status of "money." Which pure and simple is something with representative value which can be used for the purchase of goods and services.
Your laptop not money, Gold... not money. Bitcoin... not exactly money yet, but is starting to become money, its kinda like in an intermediate state between pure commodity and money right now... it's fascinating to observe.

We could, but that would be confusing for a lot of people, which is why its best to keep the Bitcoin name describing what it does, and come up with a new name for a new standard of value. You wouldn't start calling 0.01 $ a USD, so we shouldn't try to do that for Bitcoin either.

I don't really like that example. Beanie Babies were never adopted as a method of payment by buisnesses.

You fundamentally misunderstand the bitcoin technology. Your address is just a location in the blockchain, that location is generated by your wallet program, and the wallet.dat file just cointains the encryption key to that particular location in the blockchain.

Unfortunately that still doesn't answer the original question. That question was, why would I want to use BTC to purchase things and pay fees on both sides, when I could use Fiat and not pay any fees. I don't know the answer to that question.

This is not surprising at all.  I don't think anyone truly expected a bail out, it was more wishful thinking than anything else. The unfortunate state is, that what ever Gox did lose, is gone. It won't be coming back. Its unfortunate for those who had coins in gox, and I continue to feel terrible for all of those in that situation. However there isn't much to do for those people but move on, and possibly join in on any lawsuits against gox that come about.
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:10:32
you just start by taking a step back. 
Did you invest only money you could afford to lose? yes? then take a deep breath, and forget about it, write it off as lost, it happens with investing, it has happened with me, and it will happen again. Start over, and try to do a better job than you did this time. i am sure over the course of your time at gox, you learned a lot. So you invested in the knowledge you gained. Think of it that way, it wasn't all for nothing, it was for education.
No, you invested money you couldnt afford to lose? Thats troubling, but there isn't anything you can do about it now. this experience needs to serve as a means for you to grow as a person, yes you made a mistake in this case, find a way to replace the money you lost over time, i'm sure people you know would be willing to help you out if you are in serious trouble. Everything will be okay in the long run. its only money. you are still alive and well. That is the most important part. 
Whats done is done, you don't have to be happy about it, you just have to accept it, it might be easier to accept that everything is in fact lost. So that if it turns out better, you will be pleasantly surprised.
i wish you the very best, and i am truly sorry for your losses. 
Edit: Thanks for the gold, don't actually know what it does, but i will find out. i hope that my sentiments in this message were of some help to providing op with a level head.

It was only shitty if you don't believe in the underlying technology. Who are you to tell someone else what they should think something is worth after doing their own personal due diligence.

i'm glad you're not going to invest in bitcoin. it doesn't need investors such as your self weighing it down.

He will figure it out...soonish.
@_date: 2014-02-27 15:22:10
you know, life is not only about money. Money is nice, but letting it control your actions is absurd. i can not convince you to change your mind. i will just tell you that whether or not you have a job, or any money at all, being alive is better than the alternative. you only get one life to live, and to end it prematurely is the ultimate insult to yourself.

Blackcoin is more fairly distributed than BTC. No satoshi, no government confiscated coins.

Well at least this is a flaw in the internet protocol this time.

Yeah, maybe china will let us pay our debts off with Bitcoin.
Edit: This was a joke.... :(
@_date: 2014-01-05 19:53:07
Value not volume, back in '11 Bitcoin was like $30USD/1BTC.

This garbage again. Give up on these cryptos backed by stuff (Gold, silver, USD, UREA, etc...)

Karpeles? Lie??? No way! If you exclude almost everything he has ever said, the man never lies!
@_date: 2014-01-25 14:30:31
I have a feeling people will adopt the best crypto, with the best protocol. In reality perhaps that coin has not yet even been designed.
@_date: 2014-02-22 00:19:51
Do not buy bitcoins from MtGox, well unless you like making hugely risky moves.
@_date: 2014-03-02 01:38:05
What makes the U.S. government different from the collective of bitcoin users?
Technically the U.S. gvt is just the collective organization of all people of the united states, and it's value stems from the GDP of those people and the respective businesses they comprise.  
Is it not possible for Bitcoin to be backed by a large collective group of users, does not the use and backing of those people confer value in the same way that those people give value to a countries government? Maybe not.
@_date: 2014-03-01 20:52:33
I'm personally not a fan of large government, and the resultant intervention in my everyday life that comes along with it. So while my overall political ideological identification is as a democrat, I do not follow along with all aspects of any grouping. No offense was taken. We are all entitled to our opinions and observations, I respect yours for what it is.
@_date: 2014-04-03 15:55:02
It's not bad at all. The US GVT has been fairly supportive of BTC the entire time. Granted the ruling makes it difficult to use (but we have these things called computers, that can allow us to do the tabulations for us), but by no means impossible, and none of these rules do anything to diminish the advantages of BTC (fast transaction time, no centralization etc..)
The china news on the other hand is ambiguous, which is a real market killer. Bad news is one thing, but ambiguity is 10X worse.
@_date: 2014-03-03 19:17:57
Um well, someone is pumping the price up.
@_date: 2014-03-13 21:30:58
It did serve to illustrate to a lot of people how resilient it is, and shows just how many people feel it will succeed in the long run. 
@_date: 2014-04-05 18:22:07
I would believe you more if you phrased your statement "like most things in life, this will probably end badly." 
@_date: 2017-02-17 11:54:46
This is a stupid and useless presentation.
@_date: 2014-05-21 01:24:08
People in this sub find a way to hate anything. In fact I would imagine they hate how much they hate things.
@_date: 2014-03-02 13:58:36
I don't believe that, their intentions were probably good to start. Only when they became huge did Karpeles become a criminal mastermind.
@_date: 2014-03-02 02:24:22
Another idiot? How can it be Gox? It hasn't even opened yet.
@_date: 2017-02-25 19:53:40
It doesn't matter for Bitcoin. Bitcoin has grown beyond Reddit. Perhaps find a different forum for Bitcoin discussion. Like I dunno, steemit, and actually support the use of block chain technology in other facets of life.
@_date: 2014-03-28 14:12:38
Bitcoin enthusiasts are the most impatient people I have ever in my life seen. This reaction is unbelievable and dumbfounding. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 11:36:20
You don't understand how trading works. Thanks for playing.
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:37:55
Mt.Gox is not bitcoin.

Fine reporting there. Great math skills too!  /s

On the bright side that cheap whore accepts payment in bitcoin.

So never?
@_date: 2014-03-02 22:41:02
No, the insured financial institutions when ever they do lose money, just have it replaced by a government in an inflationary fashion, hurting the value of the currency for everyone, with no repercussions for those in charge of the institution in question.
Great fucking system.
I don't care if you agree with my views, and I also don't care to try to convince anyone of them either.
@_date: 2014-03-21 21:39:56
I know this but everyone likes to tell us bitcoin is a commodity, and could never be a currency. Colombia's fear makes it seem more like a currency :)
@_date: 2017-02-17 19:45:13
So you are saying bitcoiners are idiots? Thats not very nice.
@_date: 2014-02-09 21:11:12
They would certainly only be hurting themselves if they did that. Perhaps they might be too stupid to realize it.
@_date: 2014-02-26 14:23:41
Banks would then take the money you deposit and re-invest it. Exchanges can not do that.

No, this is embarrassing for both this sub and the bitcoin community. 
@_date: 2017-02-15 10:55:31
Hmm sounds like Italy could use regulations to root out corruption in the banks. Fat chance of that happening though. 
@_date: 2014-05-31 15:39:44
400 Bitcoins still isn't all that much volume. I hope they continue to grow!
@_date: 2016-01-17 15:46:36
One transaction moving around a large amount is much less useful then being able to move around a similar amount composed of 10000 transactions.

@_date: 2014-03-05 13:14:27
Yeah people make that argument... But it's false. People tip doge because it's a meme and funny. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 14:12:51
Neither government regulation nor deposit insurance would stop a gox situation from happening. If you believe so, you are just naive.
@_date: 2014-04-03 12:31:42
I believe OP's statement to be true.
Everyone is thinking short term. And yes short term the usd value of the btc will decrease. But the people who bought those btc will still have the same number of btc. 
I suppose this depends on what your intentions were. When you bought bitcoin were you looking to make a quick buck? If so I have no sympathy for you. If you weren't looking to make a quick buck then why are you worried about the price right now at all?
@_date: 2014-05-19 13:11:54
So what your saying is... they came up with Bitcoin first?
@_date: 2014-07-02 17:24:57
It did go insane. It didn't drop. This market always sells on news. Didn't happen here.

You can ask for it. providing a BTC address for donations in the app would probably end up more effective though.

Well... Ethereum is never going to see the light of day, so.....scammers gonna scam.
@_date: 2014-03-30 14:24:11
I would always have them on multipools. Its always beneficial to mine what ever is most profitable and get BTC for it. The most profitable coin at any given moment even for the SHA256 algorithm is not always BTC.
@_date: 2015-01-27 06:09:42
Its backed by wall street... so I would guess that is highly likely
@_date: 2014-03-16 20:13:45
Profit is profit
@_date: 2016-01-09 11:29:25
It was a registered financial entity, they were able to receive bank transfers and had USD/Crypto markets. 
@_date: 2015-01-17 00:41:47
The calculation is an upper bounds value, that is the maximum effect the daily mining can have, and thinking like all the coins are sold is a good baseline to have when thinking about the speculative value, because it helps to determine a minimum possible valuation.
@_date: 2016-01-28 05:16:00
Well they likely could pay suppliers in BTC and somewhere down the chain a coinbase or some other means of converting to USD is involved, that's far enough away that banks won't freeze the accounts. 
@_date: 2015-01-18 01:55:16
Yeah um... If the president of a country isn't a statist... Who would be?

@_date: 2014-03-31 00:03:37
There are other cryptos, without the joke meme of dogecoin that do as good if not a better job at transferring money around the internet. Doge is good because the community is fun. Thats it.

Look we need a consensus on a fix to allow Bitcoin more room to grow, Bitcoin Classic would do just that for now until a better solution can be implemented. This is just the bandaid that BTC needs.
@_date: 2017-02-22 18:42:38
I agree with this sentiment. Everything is grey and this decision is no different. There will be a plus and minus to everything.
@_date: 2014-02-25 02:35:42
They aren't trading anymore so... guess they have enough money to pay out?
@_date: 2016-01-16 02:04:51
Yeah that's a dumb argument. Crypto is only useful as its decentralized. Centralization makes it no different than legacy money systems.
@_date: 2014-06-26 12:02:28
What might these consequences be? 
@_date: 2016-01-11 13:20:21
I'm not so sure how much this matters for BTC price.
It doesn't matter actually, you fools.
@_date: 2016-01-31 23:23:53
Ethereum doesn't seem to be a scam. This guy is just an asshole.
@_date: 2016-01-01 19:02:30
And it starts... Pretty soon this will be ubiquitous everywhere.
@_date: 2016-01-20 23:01:02
Bitcoin wasn't dead when the price went down, it also isn't alive now that the price went up some. For Christ's sake nobody says gold is dead when its price goes down. Bitcoin is digital gold. 
@_date: 2016-01-06 00:49:19
Well they want to acquire bitcoin but not pump the price it would seem.

Less buyers and more sellers.
@_date: 2016-01-09 17:18:33
It was based in Florida, and supposedly a registered Money Service Business with the US Treasury, meaning it has to follow all US money laundering laws, but those very by state. They provide a MSB number on their website. And claim to follow all of these laws.
I'd bet its likely that despite their claims of compliance they were in violation of some states law somewhere.
@_date: 2016-01-17 15:57:26

@_date: 2016-01-17 15:44:04
I'd say it is.
@_date: 2016-01-09 06:46:06
What does this have to do with bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-01-15 19:58:49
Bitcoin is not any one person, or any one group of people. It just is, the names and faces may come and go, but bitcoin will go on. Mike Hearn was just one guy, who wrote some useful code at one point in time. He will be long forgotten, and replaced by other resourceful people. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 05:34:58
No, this rally has to "fail just like all of the others" if that happens then the next pump will moon. Thus is the boom and bust cycle.
@_date: 2016-01-20 13:32:25
What decline? You mean in price since November? These sorts of articles are so silly. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 04:58:14
Dunno about that. Bitcoin always seems to surprise. I wouldn't be shocked to see 200s again, and I also wouldn't be shocked to never see that price again as well.

I'm not sure why everyone wants a lambo here, they are a waste of money. (Is a status symbol that important? I'd rather fly under the radar with wealth) This vehicle should provide you many years of stable, quality transportation. It's a sound use of money IMO.
The real dream should just be for a kick-ass ride, and this qualifies.
@_date: 2016-01-03 10:23:02
Bitcoin, being an e-commodity, similar in function to gold. Is of course a good investment opportunity.
@_date: 2016-01-17 02:00:05
I doubt it, people realize the gravity of the situation now.  The band aid will allow for the solution to truly be effective though, by giving needed time for development and testing.
@_date: 2016-01-08 23:31:34
Yep exactly. This is one of Bitcoins greatest use cases. I believe that Gemini will surprise a lot of people.
@_date: 2016-01-11 13:26:15
People in r/bitcoin shamelessly like bitcoin? You don't say /s
@_date: 2016-01-16 16:10:52
Yes, I get them. I always respond similarly, "ethereum is not intended as a currency and is already though in its infancy experiencing block chain bloat. It's a cool project but a lot of work needs to be done there. Leave me alone, go fuck yourself."

@_date: 2016-06-13 11:35:12
Doubt it, likely now
@_date: 2019-11-14 01:13:45
Yes, an unfortunate consequence of recovering from the Bankers subprime mortgage fuckery. That said he did decrease the size of the yearly budget deficit over the course of his presidency. Trump then proceeded to increase the size of the deficit again. Its hard to fix the problem when every 8 years a Republican is returned to power and blows the deficit out of proportion again, cementing the ever increasing national debt.

@_date: 2016-06-13 14:31:12
Do your own. Don't look to me to do it for you.

It's likely

@_date: 2019-11-05 02:27:43
Oh shut up
@_date: 2019-03-09 04:02:50
So now the west has every reason to see bitcoin not succeed. If the value goes up then NK profits.
@_date: 2019-11-14 19:10:57
The point I was making was for a single country not for the global monetary system. I misinterpreted your comment.
@_date: 2018-10-06 21:21:01
Really, bitcoins centralized initial distribution has been a key part of its successful rise in price. 
@_date: 2019-11-14 10:04:17
No that's false as well.  It's likely true in the case of the US, but isn't necessarily true in general.
@_date: 2018-10-30 10:59:41
Wrong, because climate change is an anthropogenic phenomenon. Natural warming occurs very slowly. The OP just buys into talking points rather than actual data on the subject.

I was replying to your reply not your original point. Understand?
@_date: 2018-10-04 01:19:48
Even that isnt going to save many people. The amounts they owe are massive ( I am seeing undergraduates with loans in excess of $200 K.) Its going to inhibit them being able to get on with their lives, to Save for homes, invest for the future. Some of these people have monthly interest accumulation that is as big as my rent was. Even with reduced rates in the future they will be getting hammered hard, and many wont be able to escape the debt burden.
@_date: 2016-01-18 19:03:56
Even if its not the best, its a path, and one that will make things work. 
@_date: 2018-10-30 13:21:53
All of it, because it's not a historical low. Also when CO2 levels were higher (2 million years ago or what ever) the temperature was as well.

I absolutely can shit on r/Bitcoin for this one. You have people in here comparing the power consumption of BTC with that of the world banking system. Saying, oh it's so much smaller. Well no shit, it's also a miniscule fraction of the total transaction volume. The media is no more hyperbolic then people in here. 
In short it's difficult to predict the future power consumption of BTC because of the multitude of variables that come from scaling. It's also dumb to not realize that Bitcoin is incredibly power inefficient. That inefficiency is part of what makes it so secure. None of this is a black/white issue.
Then you have a bunch of conspiracy nutters shouting their insane bullshit about global conspiracies. It's embarrassing.

More coins on the exchanges lead to greater liquidity. It will make for slower price movements because there will be more coins to buy or sell at a given price point.

@_date: 2019-06-17 22:10:21
Beans cause farts not because of the fiber, but because of a sugar that they contain called raffinose. Raffinose does this because it contains an alpha glycosidic (sugar-sugar) bond. The human body lacks the enzyme necessary to break this bond, and as such we can't use raffinose as an energy source. However the bacteria in our intestines, oh they have it. So we eat the beans, the raffinose doesn't get broken down by us, but rather flows all the way to the intestines, where the bacteria go in a feeding frenzy and produce gas as a byproduct of their growth and metabolism. Thus you fart.
This is not to say that fiber can't cause inflammation in your intestines as well and result in gas. It can. But the main cause of gas from beans in this sugar.

No, I'm saying one should do what data indicates is right, not what you FEEL is right. Your stance is the correct one (with regards to free market resulting in the best deal for the consumer) in most cases, with the exception of those where competition is gone and cost of entry is prohibitively high (monopolies).

See the thing is, they didn't predict anything then. Just because things turned out in your favor doesn't mean you looking for predictive trends that weren't actually there made you smart.
It didn't, the past does not predict the future with markets. You are no smarter than anyone else. We all just got lucky that Bitcoin took off, 100K is no guarantee. Even if it does happen, it won't be because the chart showed it should, it won't be because of past trends. It will be because conditions in the world necessitate it.

Development has always continued, irrespective of the price action. A lot was happening as BTC crumbled down to $200 from the earlier run to $1000.

@_date: 2018-02-06 12:52:24
The amount of time accepted as a store of value isn't relevant, the other two are, but just because something is accepted doesn't make it logical or reasonable.

No it isn't, at all. Just because something happened, doesn't mean it will happen again. Yes, Bitcoin follows hype cycles, but those are driven by development and expansion of the network, increased name recognition etc. Eventually that will have diminishing returns. Past cycles won't mean anything. Your better off watching who is gaining access to Bitcoin, and increase of use in various countries to gauge what will be happening.

@_date: 2015-11-06 01:09:05
You don't need ways to get fiat currency into torrents. You do with bitcoin for now. So long as bitcoin needs banks to allow for fiat to btc transactions, you need legality. If bitcoin gets big enough, this will no longer be a problem.
@_date: 2015-11-05 02:24:26
If by buying you mean hitting the asking price, it does not show that, it just shows transactions. Whether or not that transaction increases or decreases the price is not illustrated. So most of the movement is being controlled by the US... but that was primarily dumping...
@_date: 2018-04-29 15:10:58
The four words are true though. Just because this is a pro Bitcoin subreddit does not mean people should lose objectivity. Realizing their is a long way to go to achieve mass adoption would make mass adoption that much more likely.

For a currency you need to be able to easily convert other currencies into it and out from it. Most of the development is from the US, making it "illegal" especially this early in the game would effectively kill it. Don't be naive. Why do you think lawmakers haven't made it illegal? It's a good technology and everyone wants to see it develop.

Volatility is intrinsic to any currency/commodity. You are just normally sheltered from it. It's not a big deal, as demand grows volatility decreases. They only way to make it better is for adoption to increase. Until that happens, deal with it.

It's safe to say now that the variance is caused by a pump scheme being run on one or more of the exchanges. Now that the price has retraced, the variance is gone.

Gold is a commodity not a currency. People don't want bitcoin to be just a commodity. Plus bitcoin moves in a day like gold does in 10 years.

It was already this way.
@_date: 2015-11-20 16:37:15
Its not, it won't be any time soon ( if ever ). Plus if bitcoin was to become worth a billion each, buying it now would still return more profit than mining ever would.
@_date: 2015-11-05 02:03:34
He's not wrong, if the US government made bitcoin illegal, that would essentially be the end of it.
@_date: 2015-11-11 19:04:15
What the heck are you talking about? Much like anything, the users get to decide what something is. Since users want bitcoin to be a currency and not a commodity then that is what it will continue to be developed as.
"Bitcoins don't care what people want" bitcoins are not a conscious entity and they don't get to care or not care.
@_date: 2017-05-08 22:03:34
Neither is true. Most alts will fail, but there is room in this world for more than one blockchain. I don't know what they will be, but I think Bitcoin will be the main store of value coin.

Mostly that troll box is people saying bullshit to con people into buying their bags. They are just trying to drive the prices up by 5% so they can sell or down 5% so they can buy. There is little truth spoken in there, and you can bet those people are not at all investors.

Here is where you start, you go to coin base or some other exchange and buy $1500 worth of bitcoin. As you will never see a return on your investment with mining. Ever. You may, or may not, if you purchase it directly. You definitely will not, 100% for certain, ever see a ROI from bitcoin mining. The time for the average persons involvement in that is long past.

Altcoins can do things bitcoins can't. Those things revolve around being specialized to a specific purpose. I don't know why you would want to do this. But that is what they allow. However their success is entirely tied to bitcoin. If bitcoin fails, cryptocurrencies fail. Blockchains don't necessarily fail though.

3 months is too soon? This has been coming for years, blow it out your ass.

Okay snowflake. Grow up. Segwit is coming. Deal with it.

TA is imaginary sorry. It doesnt work, anyone who tells you it does is a modern day snake oil salesman.

Wonderboy, what is the secret of your power?

He can use a blockchain with out using the currency aspect.
@_date: 2016-05-05 16:47:09
Well his business partner (Dave Kielman) likely did since he was actually the man behind satoshi IMO. However now Kielman is dead, and we many never know.

Why is the size of PayPal different?
@_date: 2017-07-08 11:58:24
Very well done, watched the whole thing.
@_date: 2015-02-14 01:09:05
I agree. RZRroad had a ton of promise. Now that work is being done towards its completion, its a no brainer to support it. Great for the future of crypto.
@_date: 2017-07-25 14:08:25
Not even funny.

Really good at finding the Boston Marathon bomber too. We did it Reddit!

Who cares what George Costanza says.

Circle... Just isn't very good.
@_date: 2015-02-25 11:30:39
This actually looks like a good move by the bank. Not everything is a secret reason to use Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 00:05:31
That looks a lot like an inside job. No surprises considering where its run out of.
@_date: 2017-05-22 11:04:59
The fact that it's only passing a start up companies value let's you know how undervalued crypto in general really is. There is a looooooooong way up yet to go.
@_date: 2015-02-24 16:48:50
As other people have said, it works because people collectively follow it. If there was only one person doing TA, and nobody else did, it wouldn't work for that person. Its a bunch of crap really. I don't care that you've made money from it. I've made money off of pump and dump alt coins, doesn't make them not crap.
@_date: 2015-03-18 20:56:10
And here we have a sucker.

I'm not emotional at all.
@_date: 2019-05-13 21:55:05
Trump is good for BTC, his trade war nonsense is going to really drive money into safehavens, and despite it's volatility, BTC is definitely in that asset class.
@_date: 2016-07-01 13:38:19
The chart shows an increase in volume around 10 fold however the reduced value of the currency is only around 20%. It does not entirely explain the uptick in trading volume.

Enjoy the moment. The rises are as awesome as the falls are depressing.

Ethereum is a scam. If you bought into it. You're a sucker. Haha.
@_date: 2019-05-11 20:03:06
Its interesting that it did NOT make it there. Its a very bullish sign for this next hype cycle.
@_date: 2019-05-11 19:57:45
Pathetic. You are an embarrassment as a person.
@_date: 2019-05-21 01:56:35
You're being down voted, but you are correct.

And tether should be constant because it's a pegged asset and not a crypto.
@_date: 2019-05-17 16:16:14
The media is all about sensationalism. What ever the sensationalist angle is for any given moment ... That's what they will report. Since now news is a click driven industry, the angle that drives clicks is what we get. The days of rational and logical discourse in reporting are done... Until people return to paying for news and stop the reliance on click driven advertising.
@_date: 2017-06-11 02:29:04
So what? Don't use their wallet. Done problem solved.

If they were buying they would want their users to sell so they could buy more.

Oooooooooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Who gives a shit?
@_date: 2019-05-17 20:35:01
Yes, faster at being manipulated on it's markets sure. That's the advantage to the 24 hour market. The manipulation can really be performed swiftly. Prices rise and fall with the speed of the hammer of Thor, fortunes made and lost (mostly lost) at the hands of the uncaring, unregulated market and the wealthy whales.

Anyone can file. It means nothing and isn't worth discussing.

Well gold is used to make circuit boards and other products, which would give it inherent value beyond a trading/investment vehicle. While bitcoins value should be derived from the network, and ability to rapidly transmit wealth. I mean the comparison is apples and oranges, and people just don't get it.
@_date: 2017-06-10 21:55:21
Oh god

Don't tempt it, you might not like the result.
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:27:53
I didn't say don't move your business elsewhere. Do what you want, your being an idiot IMO, but that's your right.
@_date: 2019-05-14 23:27:00
Well if people like you lose a bunch of money, maybe this trade war is okay.

Proving my point. Cheers.

Sigh, the more bitcoin becomes accepted as currency, the more stable it will become in value.

And if this wasn't happening here you would go back to bitching about their lousy support staff and yelling from the rooftops why haven't they hired more support, why are they spending so much on servers and devs they don't need. There is no pleasing some people.

Now if only they get a Dogecoin startup going.
