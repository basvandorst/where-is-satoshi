SO you got nothing, got it.

That would be a good thing in the long term.

Kleinmans Father asked publicly for information about his son and bitcoin but it was in Feb 2014 so that could have been spurred on by Craig.

Where did you read about his living conditions at the time of his death?  I hope you're not assuming that not paying mortgage equals squalor.  I've known a lot of people who just didn't like banks and lived comfortably enough to not have to care.  It kinda makes sense that he wouldn't care about the banks if he was A) having health issues and B) Satoshi who created the most anti-bank invention in the history of banks.  As long as it didn't affect the people he loved, I could see Satoshi sending last middle finger to the banks like that.

I disagree, the distribution model demands that it would be a good thing long term.

I wasn't laughing at his conditions which we still don't know because the article you cite says he lived in squalor yet doesn't validate that in any way.

From a security point of view, nobody should have access that doesn't need it.  That is a generic way to look at security that doesn't lend to all instances/needs.  I'm not sure who has commit access but in the case of bitcoin, it is probably important that there is a multi-signature approach to committing.  I hope that is there now that Gavin is removed and if it isn't maybe he should be added right quick.

Wouldn't it be great if he was hiding in plain sight the whole time?  I've read that people around him have said he practiced what he preached, he compartmentalized his life.

It seems to me that this Wright fellow makes a lot of little mistakes that would have irritated someone like the Satoshi persona we know.  It kind of makes sense that he would slowly distance himself from Wright.
