It's funny when you read published papers by PhD's that predicted the demise of bitcoin years ago though. You can't always quantify smarts.

Pretty suspicious, surprising amount of blatant shade here.

Price Viagra at the pharmacy. Then see what you can find for cheaper. Figure out why it is hundreds of dollars for like 5 pills, or pennies in bitcoin online. Multiply this market by as many corrupt governments as there may be, and as many products like this you can think of, where patent law seems to support price gouging. That's one case use, there are many others. You aren't really trying to understand it if you don't keep an open mind.

Now I understand your question better. They applied the screws for two key reasons. Establish authority, and establish precedent. But liberty reserve was not as innovative from a scientific perspective, or secure as blockchain. Blockchain can adapt to a lot of traditional censorship structures. The government itself can benefit from bitcoin’s evolution in code. Liberty reserve was just a gold backed unit, but consensus rules govern your bitcoin wallet amounts. So it’s very tamper proof, unlike a sql database on a small server cluster.

I'm starting an ICO called FUD tokens. It gets value from...guess...

If it can’t survive a legal challenge in the US, it can’t come to pass.

I don’t see it as a threat anytime soon. Kind of disagree with that type of thinking. It diversifies existing economies as it grows.

I really appreciate the substance of this post. I've only been studying these issues a short time relatively, and sometimes it is maddening to me when I see red flags for some controversial agenda trying to sweep up support. I want to be well informed, and sometimes I feel insulted that people would act on greed over the greater health of a project in development.

They can’t  keep up with the technology. Dig far enough into software development and bureaucracy and you’ll see why. Even the defense department is already testing blockchain. There are technical merits of decentralization. It’s innovation in software engineering.

You can keep your nanny state and I’ll keep my bitcoin. Don’t insult my intelligence when Equifax gives up 140 million accounts with the status quo of Swiss cheese cyber defense you don’t understand. I do understand very well the scary jargon, it’s remarkably engineered, if you had studied infrastructure 101 you would know why. 
I don’t concern myself with hangers on and fair weather investors.  I would mine at a loss to keep the tech alive frankly. Block chain solves some traditional cyber security issues in most innovative ways.  We are talking protocols being developed that have much more utility than you can imagine. Bitcoin is a leader as the first.

Pen testing to this guy is foreign, so he will not grasp fundamentals of properly redundant and secured consensus based cryptographically secure attack surfaces. Duh! Lol

Right, it’s tulips. Those damned immutable records of tulips traversing that old information superhighway. Bitcoin could fall back to pennies and still have a fortune in locked up value. There weren’t tulip wallets that could be triggered to trade by smart contracts,  but there are bitcoin wallets that will be.  How many hodlers? Huge market opportunity because of ideological enthusiasm.  Bitcoin is hardly desperate in how it is taking off, it could piggy back off any commercial business and subsidize its ecosystem development like monero,  you could subsidize investments in commodities that back the bitcoin as opposed to dollars?.  Infinite possibilities, 
People are so concerned for poor novice investors they are forgetting how to think creatively.

I think toppling is overstating it’s reach, kind of a fallacy. Visa could fork bitcoin if they wanted. In a more real sense, a decentralized autonomous network will spur innovation and maybe reforms to traditional systems.

My opinion is all of the value in all cryptocurrencies is for R&amp;D of blockchain implementation uses because they are more security resilient than traditional server clusters behind firewalls. Clusters are kind of failsafe redundancy of data, like a cloud. Its kind of like highly secure cloud money.
