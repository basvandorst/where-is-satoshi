That's good, hope they stay the same way.

People should be able to choose what currency they wanna hold or trade, removing it from Coinbase will not make any difference to Bitcoin.

Tbh I'm happy they did this, now I won't have to see the scam ICOs ads anymore. I don't think it's gonna effect Bitcoin in any ways.

And here comes the April fools pump, then a huge dump to laugh off everyone.

But keep in mind that you can't withdraw to fiat in Bitfinex without being verified. If you do have a large amount of BTC, $10k+ then after you deposit, you will get verified, thus being able to withdraw to fiat.

Is there any official announcement for that?

Back in the green and it's going up fast.

Why are you even using Facebook in 2018? Something similar happened to me as well like a few months ago and they locked my account without any notification. Ever since that I haven't used FB again.

When is it going to be $3k so I can buy more

Would be nice if anyone from Brazil posts info about it.

How is it related to this sub? Would be nice if you could explain

Is it confirmed to be a partnership or people are calling it a "partnership" just because they opened a bank account in there.

That's why sometimes crypto looks overhyped to me, idk.
@_date: 2018-04-17 21:11:12
These are just dreams of the average crypto holder, if you want to earn more and now you have to move and trade, exchange and buy/sell new coins.

It's mostly luck and finding the right coin. The project must be unique and the team must have it mind towards the goal and not money.
@_date: 2018-04-03 22:35:16
Pretty much a good point.
@_date: 2018-04-18 13:45:38
Earn more and now, like right now. You have to wait quite a lot to see huge profits from just holding and depending if you have the luck on which coins you have. But Reddit retards just go and downvote anyone who is more realistic. You can earn more in a day by trading if you know what you are doing, rather than a month of waiting for Bitcoin to reach a certain price.

So you are saying a technology used in most of the android phones can help Bitcoin?
