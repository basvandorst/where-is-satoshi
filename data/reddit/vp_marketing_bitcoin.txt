These things will come in time..
Perhaps more importantly, what pool of *buyers* will first be drawn to OB?  And what unique value proposition will entice them?  Will it be cost savings, from the removal of the payment processor?  Will it be unique product and service offerings, unavailable elsewhere?  Or something entirely different...?
"Unique offerings" is one interesting possibility, and by this I'm referring to things like "stores" run by entrepreneurs in developing countries, who may not have access to the facilities for running a traditional online web store.  Or maybe (more likely), they just don't have a bank.  But even then, what would the necessary crypto-currency adoption in that nation be, such that OB awareness would quickly spread and sellers would be on-boarded?
Will services arise to "list" your content on OB, for a small commission?  This might make obvious sense to *sellers*, since the cost of doing business falls (with p2p payments).  Does it entice buyers though, who may be satisfied with using, say, Amazon or eBay, which doesn't require them download software, obtain Bitcoin, etc.
OB must grow first without relying on the eventual ubiquity of p2p crypto-currencies.  To do this, it must offer unique value *over some threshold*, at least for an initial niche set of users it can monopolize.  The execution of it's rollout is very important if it is to garner early success.

All Krugman is exposing himself to in this clip is ill-concealed laughter, from those who actually understand what they're talking about.  Economist are apparently also now "futurists", and useful commentators on software-based protocols and standards.  
The real question has always been if Bitcoin is *useful* and unique.  If it is useful, whether as an efficient remittance payment channel, or as an open API for programmable financial transactions (between machines), or whatever...  then that's that.  Krugman and other economists like to get caught up in the economic "policy" (inflationary, deflationary), because they lack the imagination to see use cases beyond legacy "dumb money".  It is, of course, illogical to comment on economic policy before you fundamentally understand the technology that you're talking about. 
Comments like "we already have credit cards", while not definitive proof, certainly more than "hint" at a certain ignorance on the part of the speaker.  Imagine if an intelligent VC, like Peter Thiel, made a statement about crypto-currencies like this.  Would you take him or her seriously?

Congrats OP!  Bitcoin is a great way to help motivate saving, rather than needless, excessive everyday spending.  
And the very act of doing so (and accumulating) is itself rewarding.  Few things are "free", but the satisfaction and peace of mind that comes from saving (or investing) is one of them.  If you're careful and wise, people might even *pay you* to do so!  Here I'm referring to any profits you might make as a result of these actions.

Well, I disagree.  :)
Who says it's a competing solution... the blockchain hype train?  I think if you've read through the CTO's blog post, it's quite clear that these firms have needs that aren't at all addressed by a blockchain technology like Bitcoin.  Richard states this quite bluntly.
I've never said they should be using Bitcoin, or any technology *because it's open*.  They should be using Corda for this use case.  And they *should* have no interest in Bitcoin for this use case, because, for the use case, it makes no sense.  
Is it good that the pressure applied by the blockchain "hype train" has forced them to reevaluate the efficiency of their financial engagements with other firms?  Indeed it is.

As another noted, apples and oranges...
A protocol is not "owned" or operated by any single entity.  The Internet doesn't have an owner.  It doesn't have a complaint box.  The point is moot.  Companies have complaint boxes.  Companies answer to filed reports.  They're incentivized to do so, in response to real demand.  In this particular example, Paypal is a *company* that takes advantage of a *protocol* (Internet - TCP/IP).
The only worthwhile observation about the OP comment is that the individual making the comment clearly exhibits in his or her question that they don't actually understand what they're talking about.

Would you argue that the Internet is a "competitor" to financial institutions' proprietary, internal networks?  I think the Internet could probably care less (if it had feelings, of course).
I don't think Bitcoin is competing as a ledger for the use case Corda was designed for.  I think Corda plainly wins there.  But, again, Corda is not a blockchain and has little to nothing to do with Bitcoin, aside from it's supposed "inspiration".  Corda could have been designed and built, "from the ground up", in the 1990s for all I can tell.

You would sell them on an exchange, or use them to purchase goods and services, just like any other form of money.  The "price" is, by definition, the equilibrium point of supply and demand curves, so there are buyers at any price that Bitcoin, or anything for that matter, "hits".

It literally is not a blockchain.  R3 could have came up with "Corda" 30 years ago.  They claim it's "inspired" by the invention of the blockchain, though I'm not sure what that even means.  It's basically just a shared database plus some cryptography... nothing that hasn't been around forever.

They are very different structured networks, the difference between the internet (Mark Zuckerberg innovating in his dorm room, without permission) and any closed, proprietary network.  The former is open, and enables innovation at the edges of the network, by anyone.  The latter is closed to innovation, and serves a specific use case. 
There's nothing wrong with the closed, permissioned network, but it doesn't "compete" with the open network, anymore than AOL Network or CompuServe Net "competed" with the Internet.
R3 has, in essence, found a creative way of playing off the popularity of "blockchains", using technology that was readily available prior to Satoshi releasing his white paper.  Unless I'm mistaken, Bitcoin didn't invent merkle trees, or public key cryptography, or shared databases.  All of this existed prior to Bitcoin, and, thus, "Corda" could have been built prior to Bitcoin.  
So any interesting question one might ask is.... why now?  ;)
@_date: 2016-04-07 01:40:27
It serves a specific use case for them.  I don't doubt it is *useful* (Corda) for that use case.  
What they've built is, by definition, not a blockchain, so I'm not sure how it could be a competitor to Bitcoin?  Blockchains compete against other blockchains, no?  Baseball teams don't compete against basketball teams.  They're completely different things, apples and oranges.

You don't have to, and *that's the point*.  
It's a fallacy for anyone to argue that because Bitcoin is used for illegal activities, it's not a useful or valuable technology.  Technology is not objectively "good" or "bad".  Terrorists use the Internet (a technology) for recruitment, and drunk drivers run down innocent bystanders with their cars (another technology) every day.  Any intelligent analysis of a technologies utility must weight the good and the bad, and must keep an open mind on *the potential*.  
Tell your parents to open a history book.  Almost every major technologies start at the "fringe".  If anything, Bitcoin's early adoption for illegal activities is an indication that it is a disruptive and useful technology!  It would be historically significant (and strange) if it *weren't* being used by criminals in its infancy.

It's about using technology to move information and "money" (which is just information) peer-to-peer over the web.


In certain scenarios, it allows one to replace a human entity ("middle man") with computer code, which can operate in a deterministic and "trustless" manner.  It also provides an open network, which allows anyone to innovate and create value added products and services.  For example, the internet, in a sense, "removes the middleman" from communication.  You can connect peer-to-peer (using someone's IP address).  That said, many people also leverage third party services, like Facebook, that have innovated and abstracted on top of the network.  This is quite different though from a third party that operates it's own proprietary network (like Comcast, old "AOL").  Facebook uses tcp/ip (internet protocol).

Paying with your electricity (simply by plugging a device into a wall outlet) is simpler and more convenient.  It doesn't require your grandmother have or maintain a Bitcoin wallet (with "appliance funds").  It doesn't require she worry about the actual logistics of obtaining and securing Bitcoin, or the fluctuations in value.  
As with anything, there's also an opportunity cost.  Is it worth grandmother's time to wire $20 to Bitfinex, place a market order, setup a Bitcoin wallet, learn about public/private keys and wallet encryption, using , remember to replenish her Bitcoin wallet every few months.....    just so that she can take advantage of a few cool new features of the device that require some satoshis (worth maybe $1) onboard?  Maybe she should learn PGP while she's at it.

Let me correct "reach consensus" with "reach a compromise".  I would allude to Jeff Garzik's recent comments:


I think users (in particular, those "hodling" bitcoins) would like to see some increase, to avoid the Fee Event, due to the uncertainty and price volatility it would likely induce.  If there is real demand for a higher block size (for immediate applications with lower transactions fees, etc.), then there's some risk that users will leave Bitcoin (Bitcoin Core, technically) and move to that alternative.  
I don't think it's blackmail; it's a legitimate fear that another coin (a "Bitcoin XT coin") could "fork" off, and then run its own experiment in parallel with Bitcoin Core (and cause a fractioning in the community).  That's not a crazy hypothetical if blocks start filling up continuously and fees jump.  Would it probably be best, long term, for companies like Coinbase to jump ship over to Bitcoin XT?  No.  There's always some risk of someone making a bad decision though when you make it so easy.
@_date: 2015-12-31 03:15:58
Are on-chain micro-transactions possible?  Maybe.  Would they apply centralization pressure (with increased block size)?  That seems logical.  Could that centralization pressure, in theory, reduce Bitcoin's "trust-less" nature?  Certainly.
Ultimately, the point is that these are real risks, whereas offloading these transactions to a "layer-2" protocol (like LN) would potentially sidestep the issue completely.  
(Speaking to OP) - Given all of this, it makes logical sense for the Bitcoin community to explore these options for scaling micro-transactions, which don't massively bump blocksize, before going down a route with Bitcoin that, while it may be possible (that is, Bitcoin as a global payment system with massive, massive blocks), has centralization risks that we may be able to completely avoid.
@_date: 2015-12-30 00:17:59


It's a matter of no one's opinion.  
If an architecture design, in which the Bitcoin blockchain is "layer 1", for trust-less settlements, provides greater utility to society than another architecture, then it is objectively better.  Implementing that architecture (layer 1, layer 2, etc.) will provide more value to all participants in the fullness of time.  
Ultimately, this is an engineering problem.  If one believes that an architecture where Bitcoin acts as the ultimate settlement layer and judge provides more utility to network participants (with micro-transaction layers higher up), it's reasonable to believe that "bitcoins" will command a higher market price than otherwise.  In the act of self-interest, one would expect Bitcoin holders and network participants to adopt such an architecture, since it ultimately benefits them and increases the value of their own holdings.

Ethereum?  Ethereum is separate from Bitcoin and has it's own blockchain and supply/demand.
Think of an "Initial Coin Offering" as a decentralized crowdfund (crowdfunding "off the grid").  The "coin" being offered must be in demand (and thus, demand a market price), particularly if the technology proves to be useful at some point in the future (10+ years out).  In the interim, the "coin" is likely to take on a speculative value, much like Bitcoin has.  That speculative, initial value will provide the development team with funding (for development, R&amp;D, etc.) and also perk interest and media attention from outsiders.  
Speculation solves a chicken/egg problem.  Speculation solves that problem by providing incentives (potential for financial gain) to speculators and those willing to burden the risks of supporting an unproven venture.
Speculating, in this regard, has been rewarding for most:

From an engineering perspective, that's probably the proper architecture, right (Bitcoin as a trust-less settlement layer)?  One could argue that "money" is one application of the Bitcoin protocol, but that, at a more fundamental level, the real utility of the network (where it's value ultimately derives) is it's trust-less nature and decentralization.  These are necessary ingredients for a whole suite of valuable applications, in particular, those that rely on trusting a counter party (a human).

Long video (complicated topic!), but I found this pretty helpful and informative.

As blocks already fill up...  
What's the harm in bumping to 2MB?  It would reduce uncertainty and fear in the community.  Staying at 1MB for the foreseeable appearance makes it appear like everything is on the line with LN.  That's just bad marketing.  ;)

Easy answer.  You've stated Gox coins were "lost", with the implication that they're now unusable.  There's no evidence to support this assumption.  Also, I wouldn't say Satoshi's statement was "just a theory" or anything.  It's basic economics, based on supply and demand.
@_date: 2015-12-27 18:53:41
Then perhaps Core should revise its proposal?  
Bitcoin XT may be a useful tool for leverage in reaching consensus on *some* increase (say to 2MB or 4MB) for that runway.  It makes sense to give projects like LN ample opportunity to shine, before risking some of those more serious centralization concerns.

You probably have 2x main "camps" of early adopters, though of course they aren't both mutually exclusive:




The former get excited about technology and new applications.  They view and understand Bitcoin as an efficient network, that enables innovation at the edges (similar to the Internet).  They acknowledge the utmost importance of concepts like security, decentralization (which ties in with trust), etc.  They also have some knowledge of protocol layers.
The latter includes a lot of "non-techie" types, who got interested in Bitcoin largely for political reasons (not technology driven).  They view and understand Bitcoin as a "digital gold", because the analogy is simple and it resonates with them politically.  Few of them understand how LN will work, so they immediate suspect evil doing, etc.  Ironic, because if they actually took the time to understand it (there are good ELI5-type resources) they probably wouldn't fear it anymore.

Not often, personally.  
I think of my Bitcoin holdings more as a speculative bet on the utility of (yet-to-be-built) applications that might leverage the Bitcoin protocol.  I don't think of the protocol much differently than someone who'd have gotten excited about TCP/IP in early 1990s and started "hoarding" scarce domains (say simple shapes, like.... circle.com, square.com, etc.).
If you're correct about the underlying utility (and broadness) of the protocol, and you have a little imagination, it doesn't matter that there aren't useful applications to you today.  It only matters that new, useful applications are now possible and will be realized in the fullness of time.  Some applications will not be foreseeable.  For example, "apps" on mobile became a "killer app" of the internet (one could argue).  But mobile, in the modern sense, didn't even really exist in the 1990s.  It took Internet + Mobile (smart phones) to enable the use case.  There may be similar "killer apps" for the Bitcoin protocol that aren't possible yet, and may not be realized for decades (or longer).

Bitcoin made micropayments *possible*, and that's the whole point.  
Now that the hard part is done (inventing Bitcoin), it's time to optimize the architecture.  Does it *really* matter to OP if those micropayments are all posted on the Bitcoin blockchain?  Would that sound like a sensible use of resources?
Unless I'm wrong, with a micropayment solution Lightning Network you're still using "bitcoins" (yes, actual bitcoins).  You're simply deferring the actual settlement.

You would expect less people (perhaps nobody) to complain if they're marked "high risk" and it benefits them. 
You also have people like myself who've never been marked high risk when Coinbase could have (if they were truly being malicious) screwed me over.  Right after Silk Road seizure, for example, I bought 50btc at ~$90 and by the time it arrived it was back at ~$130 or something.  No "high risk" issue.  That would have been $40*50 = $2,000 they could have taken by marking my account as "high risk".  Since they didn't, I was obviously happy with the purchase, but I also obviously didn't come to reddit to post about it.
Let's assume that the bank that Coinbase works with required that they have an overly "nervous" detection system, that creates more false positives than maybe Coinbase would ideally like.  Such a system would be overly protective.  Considering how nervous banks are to deal w/ Bitcoin related companies, that wouldn't seem that crazy to me.  I would almost expect it.
How is Coinbase though now to make money if this detection system is "honest"?  This is assuming again that it creates more false positives than ideal, but that the system doesn't take into consideration how the price has moved since you initiated your purchase.  Given these assumptions, Coinbase will take the loss when an account is marked "high risk" and the price moves in the customer's favor after initiating purchase.  The customer is obviously not going to complain that the transaction was marked "high risk", because they could buy the Bitcoin cheaper now (since the price has fallen).  Is Coinbase supposed to also eat it when it moves against the customer's favor?  If they did, they'd be bankrupt tomorrow.
In a world where Coinbase is, in fact, using an honest detection system, they would be cheating themselves by refunding or "fixing" accounts that were marked high risk after an upward movement.

There's OpenBazaar (decentralized).  As a business, I'm not sure it would make particularly great sense, since a company like eBay could just accept Bitcoin and then demolish your business overnight.  There wouldn't be any differentiation to your business beyond the mere fact that you're accepting Bitcoin.  In that regard, it's as good an idea as copying any other existing business and specializing in Bitcoin (Bitcoin grocery store, Bitcoin cab, etc.).  Which is to say, not a great idea.

Many of us have been *quietly* accumulating more, throughout 2014, and we're the type that buy and hold.  We have reliable income streams, and a longterm outlook on our bets.

If you also add and verify a Credit Card, then I believe you can instantly buy BTC.  Coinbase has to be extra cautious that you don't scam them, run off with irreversible BTC, and somehow cancel the bank transfer, etc.  That's just the friction of dealing with the "old" banking system and the "new".  Once you are full BTC, everything is quick and painless.

There seems to be a widespread misunderstanding here, which comes to light in this Executive Editors question.  That is that the analogy should be between bitcoins and US dollars (paper fiat), not bitcoins and VISA.  VISA is a third party, not a currency, and they provide services that include "theft protection", etc.  There's no reason a third party like Circle couldn't offer similar services on top of the Bitcoin protocol.
If you lose $100 bill for example, you're fucked as well.  VISA is sure as shit not going to give you your $100 bill back (you weren't using their services).  The US Government is not going to make you whole.

An acceleration in these types of posts, or "expert commentary" (on the experts), should be expected.  In fact, it'd be disappointing if this weren't the case.  What's really being observed is an increase in "noise" around this fundamental innovation (Bitcoin).  Yet rarely, in that noise, is anything meaningful, new or ingenious brought to the table.  If you've been around for some time, what's rehearsed and expressed (for attention) gets rather mundane.

At a higher level, there can "never be more than 21m Bitcoins", because Bitcoin is a protocol, agreed upon by "the people", and those people have a huge incentive to maintain the rules of the game.  The probability of all Bitcoin owners (those with a financial interest) , simultaneously, all choosing to inflate their holdings and wealth away by making a change to the core protocol to allow for, say, 50m bitcoins instead of 21m, is infinitesimally small and negligible.
Consensus (objectivity) is why there can't be more than 21m.

By technical analogy...
The Bitcoin network operates by maintaining a public ledger (the "blockchain"), and by allowing changes to that ledger in a secure, timely, and reliable manner.  Bitcoins are introduced into the "market" every ~10 minutes, and the avenue of their distribution allows for a predictable aggregate supply and added incentive for securitizing that network.
Because it is a protocol (like SMTP), it allows for innovation at the "edges" of the network (by entrepreneurs and startups).  It creates incentives to innovate that can only exist when you have a generally accepted, open source protocol.

I disagree; I think most "hodlers", generally not as vocal, do not want to see a contentious hard fork.  I find this a more common opinion in the twitter community than reddit, but people are also more likely (even encouraged?) to attach their actual identity on twitter. 
I see the price creep up when Classic drama dies down; I see it drop off cliffs whenever further division is pushed or encouraged.  I think most "hodlers" in Bitcoin have seen almost everything at this point.  Most of them, I suspect, don't flinch easily, and they're willing to follow Core's roadmap a reasonable distance.  They're aware of the risks; they're the investors.  They vote with their money, and, over a significant enough sample size, leave us clues about their confidence in various proposals, etc.
I think if, suddenly, transaction costs go 10-20x and it's clear Core is impeding Bitcoin, then people will jump ship (and rightfully so).  I think, in either case, an incredible rally will likely follow - either when SegWit is deployed and everyone exhales (most likely/least sexy outcome) or when Classic takes over (least likely/most sexy).
@_date: 2016-03-05 16:29:59
no.  best measure of the market's opinion is probably the exchange rate (btcusd), since that's a proxy for actual investor opinion and confidence.  it's definitely not anonymous reddit accounts.

That is absurd.  "Too expensive" is not a term that can be applied to a "bitcoin", which can be divided into 100M's of parts.  Anyone can easily obtain $5 worth of Bitcoin, or $10, etc.
"Too expensive" also implies some objective measure of Bitcoin's over-valuation.  I'm looking froward to you sharing that...  :)
@_date: 2014-05-11 23:25:06
Here's why you *might* want to use Bitcoin today:
* If you make remittance payments, and don't want to lose 10+% in transaction fees.
* If you live in a place where you don't have access to traditional banking services (the 5 billion "un-banked").  Bitcoin gives you immediate access to a global marketplace.
* Right to financial privacy
* Securer online purchasing ("push" transactions)
* Save on purchases (ex: use Gyft, 3% "cash back")
* As a speculative investment 
They'll probably be many more reasons in 5 or 10 years.  It's like asking "why should I use the Internet" in 1994.  There were far fewer reasons than there are today.  Back then, you could have made a speculative investment in the future success of the Internet by buying up domain names (circle.com, square.com, etc.).  Today, you make a speculative investment in the future of the Bitcoin protocol by purchasing Bitcoin (and essentially taking up scarce space in the ledger).
@_date: 2016-03-26 22:12:35
Ultimately, Bitcoin hodlers are in charge.  I agree that there is the *illusion* that others are in charge, but, really, they aren't.  If they do something Bitcoin hodlers are opposed to, the exchange price will slide.  This is simply demand dropping, which logically follows...
With that in mind, how do you explain the fact that Bitcoin hodlers, "voting" with their money/bitcoins, aren't dumping like crazy if they're so clearly against Blockstream's initiatives?  If consensus were around a different proposal, wouldn't that logically follow?
Until you explain that, I see no reason to address anything else.

One must keep in mind that Bitcoin is an open source technology with *heavy economic incentives*.  People are long, others are short.  Some want to see the price go up, others wants to see it crash and burn.  Some of these are individuals, some institutions.  Some even perhaps government entities.  Some desire to see a competitor steal Bitcoin's thunder, suspecting themselves far too late to the Bitcoin party.
So why so much fighting?  Money and various incentives.  Greed.

The only "serious problem" Bitcoin is exhibiting is the issue of governance, and a now small, vocal minority.  Actual investors (holding bitcoins) appear to support Core's road map.

My first thought is that "hyperledger" is basically a response to regulatory pressures.  It would probably eventually loop back into Bitcoin.  It seems logical that an organization like this would arise, since a truly decentralized solution like Bitcoin can take a little time to evolve to the demands of industry (as we wait on things like sidechains, etc.).  Particularly when those demands are very much related to compliance, KYC (or, in this case, "know your counterparty"?).
The main "benefit" appears to be regulatory related - specifically, the ability to know who else is on the "permissioned ledger".  I don't see anything innovative here.  I see some organizations "signed up", one probably as clueless about the entire topic and what they should be doing in the space as the next.

I agree with you, but don't underestimate the power of the incentives in place (from an economics perspective).  
Markets are not efficient, and people, when incentives by the possibility of making large sums of money (in the short/mid term), will act in a manner that may not be in their best long term interest.  Just look at the 2008 housing crisis and current credit bubble.  If they believe that a short term "band aid" (bump to 2MB) will reduce uncertainty and fear in the markets (concerning blocks filling, without solutions like Lightning Network already tested and deployed), then their liable to support efforts to implement that bandaid, whether it is technically the best engineered solution for the long haul or not.  Are they correct?  Maybe not.  They're just acting as rational actors in a market, who are seeking short/mid-term gains and they view blocks filling as an uncertain, certainly-bull-market killing, lingering topic.  
The fear is of course that the market, responding to these incentives, moves toward a hard fork solution, and then Core gets vilified in the process.  A tragedy, that would be
@_date: 2016-03-08 23:22:29

It's extreme early days for Bitcoin.  It's probably being used more for speculation (trading) than anything else right now, but that shouldn't be surprising.  If Bitcoin succeeds, it's probably reached 0.50% of its potential so far.  It's reasonable to believe that a lot of people would be speculating on its future potential (that 99.50%).
The most interesting applications around Bitcoin are probably related to smart contracts, and programmatic value transfer (machine-to-machine, etc.).  I view Bitcoin payments, in the traditional sense, as more of a novelty act, though of course there are compelling use cases (as an employer paying international contractors, etc.).

@_date: 2016-01-17 01:21:29
Indeed, but I was referring to uncertainty with respect to how the impending "economic event" (when blocks fill up) will affect investor's equity (specifically, the exchange rate).  
@_date: 2016-03-26 18:03:31
For clarity, can you confirm that you're referring here to the Bitcoin developers, many of whom are working for ~1/4 or less of the pay they could make elsewhere?  
Logically speaking, how is it possible to, in reality, "buy" devs with *less money* than they could make elsewhere, given that your entire argument is contingent on this financial motive?
@_date: 2016-01-17 06:43:54
so miners and users, in mass, disagree with the actual engineers and scientists who specialize in these domains (and who appear to largely support Core's roadmap)?  
@_date: 2016-01-17 00:52:32
Even if Core is right with its roadmap (from an engineering perspective), I fear it may ultimately fail, in preventing a hard fork, due to a failure in "people skills".  And a failure to identify investor's emotional triggers and fears (of an uncertain upcoming economic "event" - the filling of blocks), and address them head on.
Investors want to see uncertainty resolved, and the sooner the better.  Core's roadmap leaves that uncertainty hanging in the air.  Investors (holding Bitcoin) are more motivated to pursue shorter term gains than longer term, and their rational to believe that a short term solution, which removes the uncertainty of that event (while other layer-2 efforts continue in parallel) will cause an increase in price.  less uncertainty ~ less risk ~ higher price
@_date: 2016-03-22 22:23:21
Maybe etc. have "controversial posters", but Bitcoin has the unmatched financial incentives to justify the manipulation.  Many people are long, many more short.  As the market cap increases, the incentive to "destroy" the thing (the potential that could be made off a large short position, for example) increases alongside.  
It's logical that the sophistication of the attacks (and their frequency) will continue to grow, especially when you have a platform like reddit that is open to vote manipulation.

Cannot deny, but what is his point?  
One must do one's own due diligence, when investigating any company (third party) and that companies trustworthiness as a counter-party.  This has, literally, nothing to do with Bitcoin's supposed "complexity", but rather the nature of interacting with any third party, in the context of conducting business.  In this specific case, that third party is a company (Mt Gox) that was running an exchange.

Easy...  Could have said the same thing about most technologies, including the internet, in their genesis.

Most technologies that start at the fringe (including the internet) are first adopted at the fringe (and often by shady characters).  If anything, it would be odd if that didn't happen.  It takes someone with some amount of imagination and vision to see how the average Joe will use it in 10/20 years.

Oh Look!  It's another economist that's also apparently a distributed systems/ computer science expert!  That must be a popular minor with "economics", which economists seem to be quite skilled at (just look at the credit bubble)!  Anyone with the faintest degree of sophistication knows that "Bitcoin" is, fundamentally, a protocol before it is anything else (including traditional "money").  An economist, thinking crypto-currency falls delicately in their wheel house as a traditional financial instrument, is an absolute fool.
I'd love to hear his "insight" into how we can "know... complete failure", and yet the exchange rate is $380/btc (as of this writing).  Most economists completely BOMB'd (in 2005-2008) recognizing a massive bubble driven by derivatives, CDOs... but yet you claim you can spot a failure with respect to an $8B market cap instrument?  
What about the trillions you were too stupid to notice go out the door in 2008??
Perhaps I'm a little slow and stupid... but in what realm of reason would it be logical to conclude that you (as a "Chief Economist") can't spot an international housing and credit bubble, orders of magnitude greater than Bitcoin's market capitalization, and yet you can spot a drastically smaller "complete failure"?  You can't see the desert in front of you, but you spot a grain of sand?
Being a glorious economist doesn't make you immune to logic, unfortunately.

Seems remarkably unintelligent to not "cooperate" when you've purchased all that hardware and it's users, not miners, that are the one's ultimately "holding the gun".  
It seems trivial for users to just say "ok, well bye" and bounce to an alt coin over the period of a few weeks or months.  Are these few miners just misinformed, or do some of them have a peculiar fetish for burning their own wealth?

That's an interesting question..
I guess it depends on what's meant by "needs to happen".  I believe there's a sufficiently large community around Bitcoin today that, if the technology is useful, it will command it's own long-term adoption.  The entrepreneurial spirit might hasten that "end", but the world's far too vexing to say who it'll be that really makes that happen.  After all, if these questions were trivial to answer then we'd all be startup billionaires.  :-)
And of course few things persist endlessly through time, so we could debate what's considered "long-term adoption".  Maybe it's a hit and some newer, far superior technology comes along in 20-years.. who knows.  Many technologies that achieved adoption over longer time intervals have been antiquated or marginalized w/ time.

Technical consensus seems pretty heavily weighted in Core's favor.   I think Adam, Maxwell and others would rather just put their heads down and get shit done.  Who is on the other side of this "debate", just Gavin and Jeff?
A small part of the community seems to still be under Hearn's hypnosis (about a week after he insulted this community), caught up in tin-foil hat conspiracies, ad hominems, etc.  Blockstream is now viewed as the corporate "enemy" even though its team (correct me if I'm wrong) is paid partially with time-locked bitcoins.

Hodlers are the investors; that's correct.
Without the investors, a "bitcoin" wouldn't be worth anything.  Without the investors, there would be no exchanges..  There'd be no volume, no liquidity, no interest.. no market!
It's these very investors, as you alluded, that "prop up" the value of the very thing *miners mine*.  Hash away all you'd like; no one can stop you..  But if there exists no buyer interested in what you're selling, then it's all for naught!  You might as well soak your wealth in kerosene and light it aflame.  At least you'll save time.

Given more weight?  Are you claiming this is no longer a technical debate, but now fundamentally an economic debate?  That makes no sense. 
That's like saying Internet websites, like square.com, have *value* (and can be bought and sold), therefore we should have architected the Internet based on economic theory above all else.  We should have put Paul Krugman in charge of architecting everything.  lmao
When you look at Bitcoin, you're looking at computer code, literally.  One has to read that code, understand it, and it's implications, before anything else.  To miss that is to not really understand the nature of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-21 23:37:27
lol!  "Their LN business."  Isn't LN completely decentralized?
The irony is that if Lightning Network works, and is a huge success, it will most certainly make the value of "bitcoins" skyrocket.  Holders of bitcoins, if I understand correctly, will also be able to make some very small interest on their bitcoins by providing liquidity to payment channels.  Imagine a deflationary currency that can also earn interest with very little to no risk (assuming all of the software is properly implemented).
If this is completely decentralized and not "run" by Blockstream, why would Blockstream create this?  Are they just humanitarians with no self-interest?
No, they're incentivized to see the price of Bitcoin appreciate over time, so their behavior is in line with that outcome.  This makes it completely possible, and logical, for Blockstream to implement technology that is decentralized and that distributes the utility of that innovation across the entire ecosystem.

I find the "ISIS has Bitcoin, therefore shut down Bitcoin" (whatever that means) logic humorous and seriously flawed.  It's probably one of the quickest indications you can get from someone that they don't actually understand the technology and its core utility.  ISIS uses the Internet, another technology, to recruit, network and spread their message.  And yet no one claims that the Internet should be shut down because it, arguably, helps ISIS grow and expand their network quicker.  Why?
Probably because the Internet is now very "real" to people, in a way that it wasn't 15-20 years ago even.  They see the "killer apps" - Amazon, Google Maps, Facebook (social networking), Netflix - and they understand how the technology affects their day-to-day lives.  The "advantages" (killer apps, efficiency gains, etc.) and "disadvantages" (ISIS, Kiddy Porn, etc.) are obvious, and anyone intelligent knows they must be weighted.  
Bitcoin takes a bit more of an imagination (and openness to ideas), since "killer apps" don't just instantaneously pop into existence.  And most people have a shitty imagination.  :)

Any actual evidence of significant cost incurred by regular users?  If I recall correctly, anyone that bumped to 7cents got their transaction through with no issues.

Yes.. let's let a FUD flash mob, representing only a small portion of the community, make technical decisions about every minute detail of Bitcoin's road map!   Especially when 80% of said flash mob appears to have not even read Core's road map (instead making ad hominem attacks on reddit, leaving red herrings left and right, being disingenuous, etc.).
If anyone has a conflict of interest, it's the "flash mob", seeking short term gains from a quick band-aid solution, at the expense and risk of Bitcoin's long term growth and prosperity.  The "flash mob" is arguably more incentivized to pursue short term returns on Bitcoin's price than any Core developers.  Only one of these parties is paid, in part, in time-locked bitcoin that can't be "spent" until some time in the distant future (as in, years from now).

It makes absolutely no sense to consider the blocks filling "problem" in complete isolation, without considering the risks and opportunity costs associated with "Bitcoin Classic".  Nothing is that simple.
Bitcoin Core is playing intelligent, conservative long ball.  Bitcoin's ethos is not "minimize transaction fees over some random blimp in it's existence".  Not only does it matter little, to not at all, if Bitcoin has some floating transaction fee market for a minute period of time in it's long, prosperous history, but it's a  complete knee jerk, panic reaction to run around shouting for larger blocks and essentially a Coup d'Etat because you just *might* have to attach a 0.0002 btc transaction fee for a few weeks.

Cryptos (eth, btc, dash) are arguably more "collaborative" than "competitive" in their nature.
Collectively, they form something analogous to their own social network.  And the utility of that network is derived not only from growth in participation over time, but also from each participant's relative liquidity.  This liquidity is the value that each brings to the fiat feast. 
It is this liquidity that enables any trader to move out of Bitcoin and into Alts without outright "exiting" the ecosystem (selling btc/usd).  In time, this dynamic will tend toward dampening the volatility of each.  You could imagine this emerging ecosystem as an aircraft carrier that self-assembles from its many parts.  And it does so in turbulent, high seas, guided only by an "invisible hand".

SegWit would be nice. Miners can get onboard too.. or not.  Their burning their own wealth in the meanwhile, pretending to be in control of something they're not.  Unfortunately for them, Bitcoin isn't the only crypto kid in town anymore.  In time, people would just jump ship in increase numbers and go to one of countless other alternates available.  Too bad for all that hardware invested in...  oh well!
With respect to article, where is the data??  How were these observations made by the author?  I think it's becoming increasingly difficult to differentiate the noise (often spam) from the signal.  That's a good sign arguably...  It's quite logical to expect the noise to continue increasing as Bitcoin's market cap rises more and more each year.  More wealth means more incentive to attempt to control the "thing" and create the illusion of chaos and disorder.  It'd be surprising actually if we didn't observe that trend.  
This logically necessitates that you bring meaningful data to the table and not opinionated commentary.  The latter isn't grounded in facts but skewed observation.  The fact that you write about it just perpetuates what's already "overbought".  You're essentially marketing that perception even more, which ironically has the exact opposite effect of the original intent.  You conquer it by (ironically) not resisting it.  Let someone else pay the tab (re noise).

No one *knew*, of course.  Many people *believed*, and I think that's the point.  There was more than sufficient precedent in Bitcoin's historical price action to support that belief.  Each Bitcoin bubble had hit a higher high, and there'd been, what... a half dozen of these bubbles prior to Nov. 2013?  
Remember how popular the "rainbow chart" was?  I believe that chart was (and probably still is) posted in r/bitcoinmarkets on a daily basis.  It would be difficult to spot a clearer indication of a sort of dogmatic conviction in the community concerning Bitcoin's future performance (far beyond $1200).  It was worshipped by many more than Moore's Law.
There was arguably no Bitcoin "competitor" prior to the previous bubble.  And, of course, it doesn't matter whether Ethereum is a Bitcoin competitor or not in the context of this analysis.  What matters is the mere fact that so much of the public ("new money") believes it and, being rational actors, will act on that belief.  Only time will tell how many Ether bag holders will get burned, if there's a temporary panic run to Bitcoin in the near future.  Contrary to what many seem to believe, Ethereum is not immune to the hype cycle phenomena.  
The tech (Bitcoin) is certainly no guarantee today.  On the contrary, I would argue that people are *more bearish and depressed* about Bitcoin's technology today than in ~mid-2013  In support of that, I'd refer back to the Economist article about the world being "Etherised".  I think that closely encapsulates the general, public consensus around Bitcoin, Ethereum, and how they relate to each other at this moment.  I'd also cite the Mike Hearn comments, widely publicized, about Bitcoin's failure and inevitable demise.  I'd cite the rise in popularity, and endorsement, of "permissioned blockchains".  I'd cite the entire "blockchain" movement, which, in general, has dismissed or downplayed the utility and future use cases of a permission-less protocol.  I'd cite the entire Bitcoin block size debate, and the public perception that Bitcoin can't and won't scale.  I would cite commentary on Bitcoin being "stagnant".  You've got the Founder of Coinbase saying this, for example (horrible move).
On the other hand, Ethereum is still near it's all time high!  To the less informed, a quick glance at an Ether chart suggest that everyone's making money hand over fist.  And, perhaps more importantly, they're make those massive returns quickly!  A quick glance at a Bitcoin chart suggest an agonizing, multi-year depression.  And then there's that distant all-time high, which hasn't be revisited since.  To the less informed, why buy a so-called stagnant, dying coin when they can buy the new, "smarter" coin that's soon to pass Bitcoin?

I'd take caution in saying things like "no one expected it" in late 2013.  People were generally bullish as hell, far more bullish than anytime sense.  A quick glance through media publications during the run up should tell you enough.  Forget $1.2k.  People thought we were going straight to $10k and never coming back.  The top posts on r/bitcoin quite regularly were all about the price. 
I would argue that the Bitcoin market is *still* afraid as hell of the previous bubble!  What you do see now is a wealth of Ethereum hype, and a surprising volume of discussion around Ethereum as the successor or replacer of Bitcoin.  Of course this discussion is typically found in the Polo troll box or in the mainstream media, not among developers of either platform.
Very recently, The Economist published an article about how this Bitcoin spike (25% maybe?) is likely short-lived, and that the world has been, as they say, "Etherised".  The Wall Street Journal said similar, along with many others.  Mike Hearn announced to the world that Bitcoin failed and that he'd dumped his stake.  Viewed as a Bitcoin "insider" to many, Hearn told anyone who'd listen to expect an eventual, slow collapse in the Bitcoin exchange price.  This announcement was widely publicized, and many believe it.  
I would argue that there's more new money looking to "get rich quick" in Ethereum or The DAO than Bitcoin.  Ethereum just moved something like 1500%; it's the "hot thing".  A great majority of the public doesn't understand what Ethereum even is, or why it was designed as it was.  Many more are being told by the media that Bitcoin is, for all intents and purposes, dead and that Ethereum will replace it's application as an efficient and scalable "money".  They're jumping in today with, arguably, *significantly* more optimism (or temporary delusion) than anyone new jumping into Bitcoin.  Ethereum hasn't had a real bubble burst like Bitcoin did to instill that fear.  Ethereum holders are in heaven, still high as a kite; Bitcoin holders are nervous as hell, awaiting a retrace.  They're so used to it now, and their judgement is influenced by it.  Everyone appears to be awaiting a big dip, or they're stock piling Ether until proven wrong (some leveraged).
Anyone new coming into Bitcoin is probably hoping for a 20% move (lol).  Ethereum buyers are hoping, some expecting, a 1000% move (Bitcoin's market cap, or higher).  Is this actually that irrational?  Bitcoin's market cap is ~$9B; Ethereum's market cap is ~$1B.  If The Economist is right, that's an 800% move to where the successor makes it's pass.  A reasonable mentality for some may likely be...
"I missed Bitcoin, but I can still get on the ground floor with Ethereum!"  Ethereum is incredible technology of course, but it isn't magically immune to the hype cycle.  And money is the ultimate network effect.   ;)

It's not a lie.  This is why Bitcoin "on ramps" and "off ramps", like licensed exchanges, enforce KYC and AML policies.  This is why they collect personal information.  A company like Chainalysis can run cluster analysis and easily spot which Bitcoin addresses are associated with Coinbase.  Coinbase can then be forced to provide personal information, revealing the individual being pursued.  
Can people find ways around it, to make their tracks far more difficult to trace?  Sure.  You can also make your tracks more difficult to trace in the legacy financial system (see "Panama Papers").

Noticing a bubble is not difficult, though Greenspan might argue otherwise...  :)
Interestingly though, spotting a bubble doesn't necessarily mean you should sell or exit the market, since one has no perspective of *where it's going*.  One only knows they're in exciting times...
Take Ethereum for example.  Anyone could have spotted the bubble and sold out at 0.00622 eth/btc, on the way up.  Maybe that person's hope would be to set a lower buy, and get back in at .004 or whatever.  Or maybe even .002, after a nice "pop".  Unfortunately for that person, it wouldn't revisit those levels in the short/mid-term.  And, even after popping, is still sitting at ~4x that level.  
Notice that by "spotting the bubble" I didn't say spotting the top.  Or eventual "bottom".  What one is spotting is the exponential rise in the perceived value of some tradable asset.  And, in highly speculative markets, that exponential rise is common, even rational, given the *power of the trend*.
@_date: 2016-06-09 00:48:37
On the contrary!  I respect speculation and agree that it's a net positive (big time).  It solves the "chicken or the egg" problem, and it definitely speeds up the growth and expansion of the network.  
Have you ever played poker?  Speaking for myself...  I would be honored to be called a "shark" during a poker game.  I've never met a player that would take offense to that, actually quite the opposite.  That's basically telling someone they're very talented.

The "Machine Payable Web".  
This is one killer app that I think is far more probable than most people give credit.  If Balaji is correct, this would create significant, persistent demand for bitcoins.  You could no longer argue that Bitcoin's price theoretically has no "floor", or that Bitcoin lacks unique, real-world utility ("intrinsic value").
This is what many critics still don't understand.  There are, perhaps, 1000s of potential Bitcoin "killer apps"; the Machine Payable Web is just one.  Many of these (arguably most) have little to do with traditional payment use cases, like online consumer purchases.  In fact, many have nothing at all to do with "money".  Statistically speaking, it's highly likely that at least *some* of these will come to fruition in the decades to come, even if the far majority of ideas put forth never materialize.  Each use case that demonstrates real-world utility and matures will "push" Bitcoin's price floor higher, given the additional, persistent demand for bitcoins it introduces.  Inevitably, this will have the affect of altering public perception of Bitcoin's "intrinsic value", even among the less imaginative and ill-informed.  Take Paul Krugman, for example.  That simple fact might make Bitcoin *more trusted* as a long term store of value.  There's a tipping point where Bitcoin's utility, in the public's eye, becomes better understood and more widely acknowledged.  A clear, albeit overdue, consensus emerges.  This has already happened with the Internet.  It seems reasonable that this shift in perception, and the establishment of such a "floor", will have the impact of reducing any remaining fear in Bitcoin as a store of value.
Similar to gold, we might then expect Bitcoin to trade at some multiple of it's "real demand" across these various applications.  You'd expect the price floor to move up with time, as more such applications come along, introducing additional, persistent demand, independent of speculation and event-driven "shocks". 
As an analogy, it might be helpful to reflect on the Internet and some of it's "killer apps".  Many of these applications matured decades apart and many more have yet to come.  A significant portion of those that exist today weren't even possible, either to pursue or even predict, in the earlier days (~1990s).  A few of these killer apps first required the emergence of some other innovation or fundamental shift, like the rise of smartphones, ubiquity of internet access, faster connections, etc.  Think Google Maps, Uber,  Netflix.  Others simply required sufficient *time* for a fundamental shift to occur in certain social attitudes and perceptions.  Think Spotify, Facebook, eHarmony, Airbnb.  
In many important ways, the Internet and Bitcoin are quite similar.  Both are Egalitarian.  Both enable permissionless, open innovation by any network participant, without prejudice or special privilege.  And both are tightly intertwined with very fundamental and interrelated concepts.  At it's core, the Internet was never just about "web pages" and "hyperlinks"
First and foremost, the Internet concerns *information*. Foritcoin concerns *trust*.

"Development decentralization" exists naturally, in the open competition between different crypto-currencies (different networks); each must compete for the attention of the market.

MSM always has an answer for what's "driving" the Bitcoin price up or down.  Rarely though do they mention the dynamics of price discovery or the "hype cycle".  The market is *always* trying to discover the equilibrium price, where supply and demand perfectly balance.  The hype cycle, as it's called, and the continued growth of the network ensure that the market is endlessly searching.  
You could argue that this is visible in Bitcoin's historical price data, over multi-year periods.  Almost all of 2016 we bounced in between a clear range.  It then "double bottomed", meaning that the market bounced sharply off the $160 low.  It recovered and then broke out of the range (~$300) on convincing volume.  You could argue that the demonstrable "double bottom" provide the market with the little extra confidence it needed to achieve a sort of consensus that, *whatever the equilibrium price for a "bitcoin" should be*, it seems convincing that it's higher than ~$300.  You might expect a sharp move, reinforced by the additional media attention, new interest, etc. 
From Nov 2015 to May 2016, the price then consolidated in a "triangle" pattern, before breaking up on reasonable volume.  It took some further convincing, of course.  We saw further consolidation below $500, before an incredible volume "fake out", trapping some.  Another watershed moment occurs.  The market achieves consensus that, *whatever the price of a "bitcoin" should be*, it seems convincing that it's higher than ~$500.  
The market does this on smaller scale too.  It tends toward impulse changes, naturally.  You can reach this conclusion with a very simple thought experiment.  Imagine there were only one Bitcoin exchange.  Also imagine that someone begins placing 10 bitcoin "market buys" every ~5 seconds.  Imagine this continues for several minutes or hours.  A pattern will emerge, and it demands greater attention the longer it continues.  The exact point in time is insignificant, but, *at some point in time*, others in the market will attempt to jump in front of this buyer, based on the assumption that it will continue.  This causes natural "spikes", and ensures the absence of a continual, constant growth in the price.  Of course, it also causes bubbles!

Good points...  Agree on the final comment.  Though bullish on Ethereum long term.
Do you believe a lot of people are now going long ETH/BTC, at a time like this, to hedge against a Bitcoin drop or "crash"?  This is suggested based on the last ~week or so of action on Polo.  It seems logical that this buying *may be the only thing holding Ether up* (over ~0.023) in the relative short term.  One might suspect, if that's the case, that many of these longs would have set a stop lose around 0.023 or so.  There could be a big Ether red candle if Bitcoin does pump higher without pulling back significantly first.
@_date: 2016-06-05 02:50:15
Bitcoin's first "killer app" is speculation/trading.  Market dynamics and psychology explain this move.  
Bitcoin had a technical breakout recently on massive volume, after spending several months consolidating.  That breakout is a sort of "watershed" moment, and it instills a great deal of confidence (at least in the short/mid-term) that, whatever a bitcoin *is* "worth", it seems most certainly higher than ~$460.  One should expect after such a breakout that there would be a substantial move.  Markets don't move up and down in a smooth fashion.  If there's consistently more buying than selling, then speculators jump in and cause a "jump" to a new price level, where confidence can then build.  Bitcoin is currently doing such a "jump" to a new level, but it's one of those rare, big jumps.  And big jumps like that tend to overshoot, even significantly.

It takes an impressive amount of discipline and, maybe more importantly, a certain persistent conviction in one's own ability to reason, independent of the shouting mob and authoritative figures (Paul Krugman, etc.).  Through a Mt. Gox disaster, through Mike Hearn, through Bitcoin "Classic", through the rapid emergence of a supposed "competitor" (Ethereum!).  Through a watershed moment for the community, on the topic and meaning of consensus.  There was a bend but not a break.
What if you began hodling in mid-2013, just as an example?  You would have bought in at ~$120, ridden a Saturn V rocket to $1100, parachuted (agonizingly long) back to $160, and persisted back to ~$580.  380% is a damn impressive return over that period, but...  wow.

I think these market makers moving bitcoin from the exchanges to OTC are the real players, assuming of course the portrayal of OTC "buy side" is anything like what's described.  On the OTC side, there would be real demand for that liquidity.  These liquidity providers, or "market makers", whoever they are, could have more influence over the public exchange trading than most think.  They certainly have more information.  It doesn't seem miners, given the current miner reward, would anywhere near fill that demand.  And, of course, if the bitcoin didn't come to OTC directly from a minted block, it probably came from the public markets.

A bitcoin "private key" is essentially just a number, within a monstrous range of possible numbers.  It is secure for the same reason that it's secure, generally speaking, to bury a treasure chest at a completely unknown location, somewhere on the surface of Earth.  It takes some non-negligible amount of time to "check numbers" (analogous to digging holes, in pursuit of treasure), and there are too many possible values to check.  The existence of such large numbers, in effect, provides your protection.  If you "store" that number in your head, you've essentially stored the ability to spend that value (sign outgoing transactions, etc) within your head.  
Since Bitcoin is purely digital, one might argue that you're "carrying" that value around with you, since the keys, so to speak, are in your head.  The simple fact of how that number is formatted in your head (e.g. base 10 number, brain wallet, etc.) is really irrelevant.  You're simply storing your private key in your head, instead of on your smart phone wallet, Trezor, etc.  You probably already do this with many, if not most, of your passwords for your email accounts and so forth.  A Bitcoin private key is essentially just another password, but it's a password that provides "control" of arbitrary value.
Moonbux is asking "what would they do...", because of the legal gray areas.  Assume I tell you that I have a private key stored in my head, which provides me with control of a bitcoin address with $20k USD value (at today's exchange rate).  Can I prove that?  I could sign a transaction, I guess.  What if I said I didn't have such a private key stored in my head (and let's assume I'm lying).  Could you ever prove it?
Now, what if I walked across the border with a private key, stored only in my head, that controlled an address with $1B USD worth of value within?

One reason would be arbitrage.  If you can buy BTC on Bitfinex for $180, then sell it on Bitstamp for $230, that's basically free money.  When people do, the price will rise on Bitfinex and fall on Bitstamp, in proportion to their respective volumes.

By "high and low prices", I assume he's referring to bubble prices (~$1000) and today prices (~$250-$300).  In that case, the statement is quite accurate (hashing power still increasing over last 2 years, actually).  But, yes, I agree with your points if we're talking about a price move that's like an order of magnitude greater.  Like probably if we were back down to $10 or $20 today.  Hashing power would certainly be down.

Yes, $360 would be a damn bargain ( seeing as we bounced hard twice of $160 (floor) way pre-halving ).  
Post-halving, and assuming a clearer consensus around scaling, $320 seems like a logical floor.  That would be double the prior floor, but taking into account halving and inflation adjustment.
Hard bounces off ~$320, if any.  Not sitting steady at $320.

A programming language is just that...  a *language*.  Just because someone has chosen not to learn the language (because it isn't written in plain English), does not imply that the source can only be understood by a few.  Anyone is free to learn the language and, hence, objectively consider the implications of Bitcoin's source code.  
There is no true barrier to entry, no secret code or "key" that only a few people hold.  To imply otherwise would be misleading.

If you want to be on the blockchain, be on the blockchain.  Similarly, if you want to take a contract to court, you're welcome to.  Just don't expect it to be free.  The labor that goes into securing the network is not a free lunch; it must be payed for.  
Miners get paid whether you like it or not.  Instead of paying "transaction fees" today, you instead are paying miners indirectly via inflation (giving them newly issued bitcoins).

Understood.  You don't find it odd, though, that it's not mentioned, with respect to blockchains (a concept Bitcoin created)?

Plenty of other indicators of lack of Classic support.  What about the extreme lack of Classic nodes or, more importantly, users switching from Core nodes to Classic nodes?   How about significant evidence of the market crashing every time something Classic related is released.  Yet, climbs in light of favorable Core-related news.  The price *is* the market.
So, on one hand we have evidence (market reactions, miners, nodes, etc.) and on the other hand we have random redditors (many Buttcoiners in disguise).
Thankfully, it looks like this issue has finally come to a close (and with a nice rally).

I would think you'd want to, in particular, avoid discussion "outlets" that are more prone to *potential* manipulation.  Whether it's actually happening or not is moot.  In person is useful, simply because it's clear no one is a bot (unless Vitalik shows up).  Online chatter is also less clear... no facial cues, vocal inflection, sense of collaboration, etc.  I mean, would someone honestly say "Fuck You" during a civil, in person professional discussion?
There's nothing intrinsically wrong with online discourse, of course, but it's another ambiguous thing that opens up potential manipulation/confusion because it removes information (those cues and such).

maybe... thankfully the people that ultimately decide these things are the "shareholders" (holding bitcoins).  they're incentive is to see Bitcoin's utility maximize in the long term.  and i think most of them are well aware that decentralized layers make Bitcoin, as a protocol, more useful to the node participants than centralization (with a few powerful nodes).  that's why most of them are here to begin with...  namely, the remove those intermediaries if and where possible.  
bitcoin, as a technology, is one that fundamentally resists centralization, and centralizing forces.  we're seeing that play out now...

Oddly, I find the "Bitcoin Computer" almost more effective as a marketing campaign than anything else.  The Computer has a purpose, as a "dev kit" for micro, machine-to-machine transactions, leveraging the Bitcoin protocol.  If you're in the IoT space (including Cisco, Qualcomm, etc.) and you weren't looking at Bitcoin, you sure as hell are now.  If you hadn't envisioned this application of Bitcoin, now 21 has put it right in your face (making it completely obvious).
Keep in mind 21's ultimate goal -- that is, to implant a 21 Inc "chip" within every IoT device.  You don't get to a $500m+ valuation selling $400 units to hackers.  They're not looking to turn some insane profit on the Bitcoin Computer.  It's simply the first step in an undoubtably well thought out plan, likely to span a decade or longer.  If the Bitcoin Computer simply draws 21 enough attention, it will have been a grand success.  ;)

If this story turned out to be true, it's just as likely, if not more likely, that 300k bitcoins are gone for good (inaccessible).  That would increase the value of everyone else's bitcoins.
Even if someone was "dumping" 300k bitcoins, they would be incentivized to do so in such a way that would minimize the effect on the exchange rate.  Their goal would be to get maximum value for their 300k bitcoins, not "dump" them and, in doing so, destroy confidence in that entity.

If 21 knew my wallet address (say, embedded in an IoT device), they could potentially spot my zero fee transactions as they are signed and sent to other nodes on the Bitcoin network, right?  Say an app uses a satoshi to authenticate with the Cloud or something, and without me having to do anything.  21 could spot those zero fee transactions it seems and mine them itself.  Zero confirmations would be completely fine.

Failed to mention the software stack, which is perhaps the most interesting part.

While these all might seem like petty things, to the 'mainstream' person selling traditional goods, it seems like it is an experience far worse than what they're accustomed to having.
I'm not trying to sound negative, I just think that I'm not informed as to why it's the mall killer app. I feel like it'll just get washed out right from the get go with illegal goods, pedophilia, etc?

I'd think the cheapest option is likely to be a major exchange (Bitfinex, Coinbase, ItBit, etc.).  $80k in BTC is not much.  A market order will slide the price... $1 maybe (on that one exchange, momentarily)?

For fun (!), let's run a quick thought experiment...
Is there ANY sort of device you might purchase, where it would be useful if you could "pay" for services (peer to peer), over TCP/IP, directly with your house's power?  21's entire thesis is built around the idea that it is convenient, and that people are willing to pay for it.
Think about it.  Bitcoin, as a protocol, is really the only technology today that allows one to essentially plug an electronic into a wall outlet, connect to others (over TCP/IP), and essentially teleport the *value*, or some fraction of the value, of that electricity over the internet.  Will you really give a shit if some service you use, which leverages some satoshis, increases your electric bill 5 cents per month?  Would it be more convenient for you to purchase the satoshi's yourself (for, let's say 2 cents), and save 3 cents?  Not for most busy people.
This is about turning your power sources into a beam-able form of value, for certain set use cases (again, think micro-transactions).  It's not about efficient mining.  It's not about preloaded, finite wallets.  It's about abstracting the concept of power, and turning it into a commodity one can teleport efficiently over the wire.

So, I guess if you live overseas and play on PokerStars, you could not deposit indirectly with Bitcoin.  Hard to see why that's as big of a deal as people in r/bitcoin paint it to be.  It was never hard to deposit on PokerStars or FullTilt with a Credit Card, ACH, etc (speaking from a US Player's perspective, pre "Black Friday") .  In fact, it was free and extremely easy, because companies like PokerStars are more than happy to eat any processing fees just to get you on their site.  They make far more off the rake.
So now there are 80 ways to deposit on PokerStars instead of 79.  Ok...   Still doesn't change anything or open up PokerStars to US residents.  I'm not hating, just playing devil's advocate and speaking from experience.  Unless you are a Bitcoin enthusiast already, you aren't going to jump through 50 hoops to deposit via Bitcoin, when you can deposit via Credit Card with practically one click.

Bitcoin and Ethereum are Apples and Oranges.  Ethereum wasn't architected for efficient value transfer ("money"); it was architected for smart contracts (which may deal with value transfer).

And that's the point.  If you wholly believe that crypto-currency, and specifically Bitcoin, provide the greatest utility to participants, then you aren't anxiously thinking that "private blockchains" will ruin the value of *your* bitcoins.  In the fullness of time, the superior implementation always wins out.  Does anyone still use CompuServe Network?  Microsoft Network?
Remember that a fully decentralized protocol like Bitcoin enables innovation at the edges of the network, something that clearly isn't possible with a "private blockchain".  So, really, you just go back to the original question, before crypto-currency necessarily even came into play.  Who can build products and services that will provide the greatest long term utility to society...  "private blockchains"?  Or an open system where anyone can innovate, and free market dynamics can thrive?
@_date: 2015-10-30 20:25:49


That's a good point.  Is it possible, though, that 21 Inc., knowing your device's wallet address, could "spot" your micro-transactions, with zero fee attached, and mine them?  In that case, 21 would be in a sense subsidizing the transaction costs by just mining those transactions themselves (so they get into the blockchain with zero fee).
@_date: 2015-10-30 18:15:35


Isn't that the point?  Value *with respect to someone or something*, not intrinsic.  A gold bar is as useful as a pile of shit, in an objective sense.  Humans may find relative utility in gold for jewelry, industry applications and such, but what about prior to "humans" (or even just 100k years ago)?  
On what year and date did gold magically obtain it's "intrinsic value"?  You must believe that such a finite time exists, if gold wasn't intrinsically valuable (prior to humans) and today somehow is.
The truth is that gold is simply scarce and useful.  No further ingredients are required for something to have a value, whatever that value might be, or however difficult it might be to compute the precise value.  Bitcoin is also scarce, and it is useful as a universal protocol for trust.  It's possible that Bitcoin, or another crypto-currency, could trump some of the current utility that's "assigned" to gold (for example, as a decentralized store of value).

True, and *to be honest*, volume is rarely, if ever, just spontaneously high.  The order book has to build up, then larger orders can occur with little slippage.  It feeds off itself and builds.  Give it a few months, and let's see how the volume adapts over a reasonable sample of time.

Bitcoin is far ahead in the decentralized "money" pursuit.  Lightning Network, for example, is not built on Ethereum.  Ether itself is categorically not as efficient as Bitcoin for simple value transfer.  That shouldn't be surprising, of course; it wasn't engineered to be.
The determination of which protocol is objectively a superior "money" is not a matter of market cap comparison.  Nor should that be judged as any different than comparing a pineapple to a kangaroo.  They're distinctly different.  And that's good.

One of the beauties of decentralized "currency".  You get to witness phenomenon like "halving" events, which have no comparable precedents (to my knowledge).
It seems Litecoin's halving induced a mini bubble of sorts.  Now that people are *aware* of this outcome, would it repeat in Bitcoin?  Or have people **learned** now how markets react to halving events, and trading strategy will adjust as Bitcoin's halving approaches?

The "internet" consists of a protocol suite, the foundation of which (things like tcp/ip, smtp, etc.) remains largely unchanged to this date.  A failed comparison like this (email to "internet today") only goes to demonstrates a certain incompetence or lack of understanding, on the speaker's part, of how one intelligently architects such networks.

It's dependent on economic consensus.  If investors don't like what they're seeing, they sell (jump ship).  If they do, they "hodl" or buy.  The very idea that changes to the monetary supply of Bitcoin are in the hands of a few, and not ultimately in the hands of investors (who vote with their money) is off base.

Nothing is "decided", in a final sense, by a few humans.  If the humans with their hands on the switch do something that isn't in the long term interest of investors... investors who are, in a sense, propping the Bitcoin price up and providing incentive across the entire ecosystem...  then that project will fail.  Investors will jump ship to a competing solution.  Ultimately, individual players can not move a market.

If by "Blockchain" the speaker is referring to "permissioned networks" or shared databases, then the comparison is even farther off base.  That would be analogous to comparing the Internet of the past to intranets of the present.

The idea that Bitcoin "hodlers" (investors) aren't ultimately in control of Bitcoin is ridiculous.  if something happens that investors don't like, they'll all jump ship and the exchange rate would tank.  If that wouldn't be an obvious indication of the economic consensus around whatever happened (a change to the block size, etc.), I don't know what would be.  
"Powers to change"?  Temporarily, maybe.  **But the market has the power to exit (sell out)**.  The merry-go-round stops right quick if the market cap tanks, since it's that very market capitalization that incentivizes *everyone* (miners, startups, etc.) in the ecosystem.  Any action, therefore, by those developers that doesn't align with the desires of the market is futile and self-destructive (to those parties).  They would simply be, voluntarily, removing themselves from all future Bitcoin development.
No one controls Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-07-07 23:40:29
That's your anonymous (and unsupported) opinion.  Here's the thing though...   You have to *prove* that there is a consensus around that line of thought; it's not the other way around.  We've yet to see any real evidence of a market consensus around "on-chain scaling".  Actually, we've seen nearly the opposite.  One could probably pinpoint 100s of "signals" suggestive of the market's general disapproval of a contentious HF.  And, of course, "money" talks louder than anonymous reddit posts.  
As an analogy, take Bertrand Russell's celestial teapot:

You need to provide evidence.  Where are these dozens of other people?  Provide a link to "ignored and laughed out" commentary.  Drawing attention to some specific data points is irrelevant, even insulting, to a reader with some basic statistics knowledge.
There is a clear consensus in the technical community that it's, at minimum, worth exploring these solutions.  And there's, arguably, never been a shred of evidence that "Big Blocks" represent some noteworthy percentage of the market, let alone anywhere remotely near a majority.  The best evidence put forward has been references to specific data points, like peculiarly synced reddit posts (lol) and Classic node count...  The latter of which is hilarious as well, given a trivial analysis of the distribution of "backers" that funded the launching of those nodes.
I'll bet I could go out tonight and find a handful of people that think Mickey Mouse should be POTUS.  That doesn't suddenly make it consensus.  It doesn't imply that the "community", and it's voice, is being shunned.  You would be rational, having heard such an argument, to dismiss it outright as absurd and manipulative.  Head count doesn't matter, only percentages.  Consensus, however you define it, is with respect to *portion* of some whole, not an arbitrary numeric value.
@_date: 2016-07-08 00:06:37
This is what happens when you're too "social", particularly on twitter.
If you aren't careful, you can expose (in the language you use) more about what you don't know than what you do.  You leave suggestive "crumbs" every time you distribute your thoughts.  When you speak often, those signals, and what they collectively suggest, becomes statistically significant - highly suggestive of a certain incompetence or ignorance on the part of the speaker.  And then people begin to hate you.

I don't think that's the speaker's intent with the analogy.  He or she goes on to mention Bitcoin being "merely the first application", in reference to what I presume must be "permissioned" blockchains or other shared database models.  No one would say though that SMTP or TCP/IP were the "first applications", they're part of a larger suite of protocol layers.  Bitcoin in that sense isn't so much an "application" but that "trustless" foundational protocol layer on top of which all else "blockchain", at least that which is interesting and open, can be (and is being) abstracted.
