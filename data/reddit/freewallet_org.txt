When you send money and the transaction is successfully posted to the network. Fees charged from the transactions are needed to support the networks that run the coin/token. The fee amount depends on the level of difficulty of the transaction and the current network load. You can always see the estimated fee when you enter the transaction amount. This is the fee that will be deducted from the sum you are about to send.

The case number is 141575 and we run our wallet using our standalone service.
Based on our terms and conditions, we are entitled to running anti ML and verification procedures.
The referenced customer is on the way to complete the one at the moment. We are monitoring this issue in order to resolve it ASAP to the customer's satisfaction.
Thank you.

[marsauthor]( your awareness of our procedures is rather speculative. 
We guarantee that these funds are not lost and in no way could be lost.
@_date: 2018-12-03 16:48:09
Only your friend can say why :)

[marsauthor]( it's always good to see that someone can compare all existing KYC procedures and make a "proper" conclusion being purely based on all-reddit-around discussions.
The funds are on hold as it's supposed to be under every KYC procedure. JFYI: the "lifetime" of the whole issue is under 2 days and we've not received all the requested info. But this time was enough for Reddit to "bury"  2 BTC.

Hello [marsauthor](
The referenced Bitcoin address is fully legit. This is our cold storage address.
Let us explain how it works. The address displayed in your app is a so-called "hot wallet" used for receiving transactions. Keeping the funds there as well as storing your private keys locally could be a risk because if the access to your device is compromised, it would give a hacker an opportunity to steal your assets
That is why after you've received a transaction, the funds are moved to the cold storage. Whenever you need to make a transaction, your funds are transferred from the cold storage as well. Your actual balance is displayed in your app; what you see on the explorer are intermediary transfers of funds in/out of the cold storage.
Thanks to the cold storage technology, even if your phone gets lost or stolen, you can easily access your wallet using another device.
Thousands of transactions are going through our service daily. If ensuring the liquidity for 2 BTC would be a question for us, we would never be able to run fast and efficient service as we've been running during all these years.
The next point - why are we requesting some users to pass 4 steps' verification? 
There are different signs of suspicious transactions that would make us initiate this procedure. It's never taken on a random basis: in doing so, we are fully compliant with the law.
As for the the user in question, let us confirm that he is on the way to complete the above-mentioned procedure.

We are doing so because we do comply with the AML requirements.
You can always check the info in our terms and conditions.   
Still, we believe it's not the source for Redditors who are fully aware of all existing financial procedures. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 17:11:49
Your friend must have misunderstood something, we do not have a deposit fee. Please ask him to contact our support team, if there would be a need in clarifications.
You can store your funds on your account as long as you want without any fee charged for that. Just please make sure to enable all the security features needed to keep your account safe.
A fee is charged for on-chain transactions, meaning when you are trying to send your assets to an external service.

Sorry to hear about a disappointing experience of your friend.
Let us refer to our terms and conditions entitling us to conduct the verification procedure within a reasonable time frame. Usually, we run it when we an account shows suspicious activity.
Would you share your friend's user ID so that we were able to prioritize the investigation on this case?
Looks like we've received an update on this case on Twitter. Just to confirm: this case is on our priority list. At this moment, we are waiting for the proofs required to proceed with the further verification.
