So , the cyber compute power just like stock price ? Buy low sell high ? What about difference between them?

Free market Competition surely be good and keep alive of miners.
But if the market isn't free enough, it means price or cost maybe distorted, that miners profit would lost.
Agriculture was manipulated by many governments , and some of product price is totally wrong. Then the farmer or engineer became decrease.

Yes, you're  right ! CCTV is China Central Television.

Select Ron Paul to be President ! And Bitcoin will burst !!

Bitcoin isn't physical at least, it's array information by electronic signal.

I doubt this. More and More productor disappear in some industries, and the reason is complicated, the difficult and price will not all things. There are much more elements will accur which may decrease the miners.

Government may block it by law or network. Prohibit law can effectively reduce the bitcoin economy wide, but black market can still use it secretly. I prefer to concern the network block, like GFW which would fundamentally cut off the communication between nodes, so that the core function of the entire network has been seriously damaged, Even when the legal environment tolerates businesses accepting bitcoin, it's technically impossible to use.....
@_date: 2017-11-04 06:54:51
Sir, How do you think about China GFW threaten ？ In countries where the government controls key transmission nodes on the Internet，What is the biggest possible threat to bitcoin networks ? Technically, the government controls the physical devices that are transmitted over the network. Can they actually block the bitcoin network if they want to?

Monero keep highly vigilance on PoW centralized trend, it's a very wisdom behavior, We should learning them !

8btc Rely on large company sponsorship and public relations fees charged by the darkness for low moral standard of garbage media company in China, what is more ridiculous,  they also issued a company coin (BTM) which was completely  controlled by the company and bitmain's money.

What will happen without signaling ? If S2X hash power get big enough rate, what will happen to the broadcast package ?
@_date: 2017-10-09 00:18:00
I'm asking Nov 2017 s2x - What will happen without 2x signaling ? If S2X hash power get big enough rate and they keep mining for a long period, what will happen to the bitcoin network broadcast package ?

Sir, If someone running a full node (non-miners), but he can not get any  reward &amp; economic interest directly, so why does he choose this ? I think many people would consider it , then give it up.
@_date: 2017-10-07 19:10:21
OH...I get some point now. 
My last question: If according to 'unlimited blocksize dream' -- bitcoin's transaction efficiency catch up with Paypal &amp; Alipay , even  exceed them, then at that dream level, at that day, how big would full block chain size be ? 500GB ? 500TB ? Can we calculate it today ?
@_date: 2017-10-07 18:42:24
But ... lightning network is not full node too, it's off-chain, why core developers tell me the importance of run my full node and .....the must know LN-network may reduce the adoption rate of full node ? If I'm a ordinary average person, I can get LN-network handily &amp; low cost, so why I think 'be secure by my full node' .... ?
@_date: 2017-10-07 18:13:35
You mean , a full node is my bitcoin secure ultimate solution ? Those who care safety more , he would choose running a full node for himself ?
Nice logic :) Thank for your reply, I think maybe you're right. But many people too stupid to understand what is safe &amp; how to get safe, finally, it's a social problem, not tech.

Some blind optimism misinformation about Bitcoin that needed to be clear :
First, "Bitcoin is peer to peer, needless third party". It's not accurate, Bitcoin need online miners and nodes for verifying and packaging and broadcasting transactions when sender pay to receiver.
Second, "Bitcoin total amount is limited". It's not accurate,total amount is just a protocol clause, it depend on the people who decide himself accept it or not. If they want change the amount, and they get nodes majority say 'Yes', then total amount can be modified.
3rd, "Bitcoin can not be blocked by government technically", It's not accurate, the key point to blocked by government is not technology but the cost of block's law enforcement, if they get support by enough people to enforce it, that is easy for physical regulatory authorities on the Internet to block bitcoin network.
So, keep vigilant when people's ideas begin to change.
