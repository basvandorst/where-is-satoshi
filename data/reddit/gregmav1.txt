Is this medium news or big news? I can't tell/decide.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:21:17
yeah... don't do this.  if you don't even know how to short goldman sachs and wells fargo (you literally can, and it's super easy, anyone with any knowledge of finance would know how), i don't think you have any business attempting to do this.

I'm kind of at a loss for words... but in case you aren't trolling, you now have $1,000 invested, don't you? Your $600 is now 1,000.  Leave it in there if you want it all to be in there invested........

I mean honestly no one knows... but I think it's a combo of mainstream/futures... and FOMO from the people ALREADY HODLING, which I don't think has happened before.  In the past I think many people would gladly sell and take some small profits.  But there's a feeling right now that this is going straight to 15k+ rather than any ups and downs, and no one wants to sell themselves 25% short by cashing out a day or two early.  So aside from just regular FOMO, there's FOMO from people already holding and everyone is trying to buy up with any extra cash they have.
Basically very few people are selling and everyone is trying to ride this swing.
There might be a crash, I thought there was going to be one, but tonight has made me think that's not true.  The crash will come at 15-20k+ now.

That's what he's saying...

Nobody knows man. 
Best advice is probably to hold... May go down, may not, but in the longterm it's probably going up no matter what.

"The researchers focused on stocks, but Hulbert believes the results apply to crypto-currencies as well." just... such an INSANE throwaway line that 100% undermines the whole article.
Last line of the article, throw in that this applies to something completely different but hey, probably applies here too!  Fuckin joke.

He has to pay rent.
OP, pay your rent. Good job on making whatever you have so far on btc.

Re-read my comment... I didn't disagree with his premise, and you're acting like I did.  I said that high fees, still aren't good.  We are allowed to complain about them, and should complain about them, even while keeping in mind that's not the main purpose of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:31:48
It really is such a thought provoking meme, love this one. Makes people realize what bitcoin is actually trying to be, a way to wrap their head around it.

What a great problem to have!
But seriously, you are lucky to be in this spot and have a multitude of options.  I agree with some others who think that taking some out right now would be very very prudent.  Wasn't that the whole point of the investment? Make a ton of money? You've had 30,000% return on your investment, something bankers literally can't even dream of.  Take some out, how much is up to you, I would take out $200,000.  Make any money troubles practically disappear, have a huge down payment on the house.  
You say this money isn't "life-changing", but it is.  You've made your and your wife's salary for 20 years.  That's life changing.  Cash some out now, you've made your money, congratulations.
Also, I'm a lawyer and about your divorce question, here is what I believe would be the lay of the land.  I don't want to give you advice but you can judge for yourself what you would want to do.  Also laws vary by state so you should check what yours would be.  Generally, any investments made BEFORE you are married, are yours.  I don't know when you got married.  Any investments made during the marriage, should go towards both partners, and the divorce would split that investment between the two parties.  Of course, this is for known assets.  There isn't a better hidden asset than bitcoin.  So... I will leave it up to your imagination on the different scenarios that will play out, whether you tell her nothing, some of what you have, or all of what you have.  That choice is yours. But any investments made during the marriage, any income or returns from those should technically belong to both parties (again... if known). PM me if you would like more specific info/advice, but I would 100% recommend going in and speaking to a lawyer about your situation who specializes in divorce, if that is a sincere worry in your mind.  Congrats again.

limit "makes" the market... you are putting out the asset to sell, or are putting out the money to buy.  if you do market, you instantly get a fill, but you are "taking" from the market, so there's a fee associated with that.
downside to limit is to get filled, you technically are going probably the opposite of the way of the market at that exact moment.  if you are limit selling and you get a fill, then that means the market is trending up and people are buying... and vice versa for limit buying.  the downside is that you may not get a fill and your trade may not go through...
say the market is at 9500.00 and you dont want to pay the transaction fee so you don't want to do market buy. so you say okay limit buy at 9499.99... but the market never gets down to that price, and bitcoin goes up to 9600, 9700, 9800.... in an hour its at 10200.  you've missed out on all those profits because your buy never went through because the market never reached your limit.  any time you limit buy, you are doing at below the current market price. any time you limit sell, you are selling at above the market price.  so there is a chance you never get a fill if the market is trending the other way.
hope that helps.

I've always thought about this.  There's going to be millions and billions of dollars worth of bitcoin that sit forever on a hard drive or in wallets after people die suddenly without telling anyone about their bitcoins.  Just sitting there until the end of the time, unused, unknown to the rest of the world.  Going to be really, really weird.
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:02:55
Okay I understand, thanks.  A little confused though, I understand if you have a private key, you can write it down or keep the number / key yourself.  But, so where does the actual money sit? I feel like you need to "send" it somewhere, or else it's sitting in coinbase or airbitz or something of the like, right? It has to be sitting somewhere at some point, you can't send it to nowhere and write down the key?
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:01:01
Oh, I don't have much at all.  I completely agree with you, but you know there's many many many people that that isn't the case for, and billions of bitcoin that are going to be lost in wallets forever.
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:30:39
Is there any chance that like... say the hard fork goes, and there's two forks now.  Would I only get one on airbitz? And if that one turned out to be the weak one, I'm screwed?
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:59:47
In what way are they similar? Because both can go up and down based on dollar value? Is that literally it?
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:35:38
Not a good metaphor at all in my opinion.  Those pockets of gold were or can be dug up, these lost bitcoin can't be.  The gold was and is waiting to eventually be found, my point is bitcoin is the exact opposite.  Once the user who had the knowledge that his bitcoins exist, or has the seed or hash key in his brain, is dead, it's gone. It will never be brought back into circulation, gone into darkness, sitting on some hard drive or in some electric wallet until civilization is done.
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:37:34
And by own wallet, you mean, physical hardware/USB trezor thing right? I haven't gotten into that stuff at all and don't have enough money in bitcoin to make it worth it yet, but just wondering.
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:06:55
Regardless, high transaction fees are not good or something that anyone except the miners want.  High fees are not good for any currency or value.

Boies Schiller is a really really really good firm.  Like, top 20 in the United States, legit as hell, one of the top American litigators of all time is the founder, Boies.  So yeah, just throwing that out there. This isn't a throwaway case or a conspiracy law firm or something, this is as legit and serious as lawyers and lawsuits can get. Interesting.
