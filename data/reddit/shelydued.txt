Yeah, oh well. I don't waste time trying to convince people. If they want to listen and have a civilized conversation, then great! I may even change my mind! But all too often I find that they just raise their voice, constantly interrupt, and then play the ad hominem game. So most of the time I just listen to what they have to say, reply "ok, I see" and move on.

Warning! Unpopular opinion, please don't downvote, but you certainly don't need to upvote.
I wouldn't particularly call him stupid, I think it's more on the lines of how we try to teach technology to our parents and grandparents, and after all these years the still barely know how to open an email.
If some of us were to properly sit down with the man and explain how it works, why it works, and how society and him would benefit, we could make progress. If he were us today, I think he would be a believer, it's just age and the use of old antiquated ways that are holding him back.
Again, I know this is an unpopular opinion, please don't downvote me to hell and back, just don't upvote if you don't like this.

I was actually pondering this the other day while standing on the porch! So glad someone else can confirm!
@_date: 2019-07-12 20:35:35
I know. Sad that we can't all express our thoughts without being attacked. At least I don't attack people that I disagree with. I think it's rather childish.
@_date: 2019-07-11 19:31:21
It's all very interesting.
@_date: 2019-06-29 19:04:06
Ok might do that. Everybody here has tons of good ideas
@_date: 2019-06-29 17:44:19
I'll try! Sometimes I forget to keep people posted on things, and it'll be a little bit. I've been saving my money because I've been on medical leave for a year, tonight is my first day back at work! Also on my to-do list is to upgrade the small minecraft server I run. So after I get a paycheck or two, I'll order the stuff I need, rn I'll just price things out and make a spreadsheet.

Well, my first thought is online. Here's the first result that amazon gave me for "3 amp USB c power supply".
 BELTRON Turbo Fast USB-C/Type C USB Wall Charger 5V / 3 AMP 18W with Built-in Cable (Compatible with: Sonim XP3, XP8, Galaxy S10e, S10, S10 Plus &amp; All Type C USB Devices) Intertek ETL Certified 18W 
Edit: also seems to come in a 30watt model
@_date: 2019-06-30 14:32:59
Well that's still a win to me!
@_date: 2019-06-29 20:41:28
I do realize that, and that is why I turned here to at least get a start and hopefully learn a thing or two from people that have experience. Also, isn't it a good idea to ask questions if you don't have the slightest idea of what you're doing in the first place?
@_date: 2019-06-28 23:41:31
I think I read that it now requires a 3 amp power supply vs the 2 or 2.5 that the older one used. More is better, so that if you have like a fan or something on it or have it overclocked, you'll have some headroom and won't be maxing out the power supply constantly.

I suppose the biggest issue I would face is getting a big enough SD card that's affordable, unless I can have the node use an external hard drive or something. If I do this, I want to make sure that there will be enough free storage for the block chain as it grows.
@_date: 2019-06-29 15:55:50
That's an option? I just figured that with the demand it would place in the CPU and storage running only one would be best. But I guess, now that you mention it, with 4gb of ram, I could run both.
Btw, what are the main differences between the two?

@_date: 2019-06-28 23:56:35
Oh, no problem! I'm more than happy to help, I just hope I don't accidentally steer people to a bad product, so double check the reviews. I would take note of any bad reviews also like if people say that it doesn't last, or died after 4 months or whatever. It's so hard to judge with all these cheap Chinese power adapters. 
Maybe you could use a Nintendo switch charger? Not sure what they are rated at but might be good quality.
@_date: 2019-06-29 18:30:27
Alright, good idea, 500gb should be sufficient for a while right?
@_date: 2019-06-29 17:33:22
I have plenty of bandwidth from my isp, with a speed test I get about 114mb down and 12 up, with no data cap. And I already pay for a vpn that's unlimited and doesn't keep logs. So I'd say things do look good
@_date: 2019-06-30 05:40:14
Good point. I didn't realize the storage was capped, maybe that's different on the 4. I did look up the recommended configuration for a node and it recommends disk access speeds of 100mb/s. I can't name one micro SD card off the top of my head that can support those speeds, and I also got to thinking, which the limited number of read and write cycles of flash memory, using a flash drive or SD card wouldn't be good. Maybe I could find a good deal on an external ssd or use an ssd in a 2.5 inch enclosure. If I wait long enough the case manufacturers might make a case with a build in compartment for a drive?
@_date: 2019-06-29 17:27:00
Ok, awesome! Will do!
@_date: 2019-06-29 16:33:49
I'm just hoping I can get at least a little kickback from running a node, but if I don't who really cares, it'll help network!
@_date: 2019-06-30 05:33:34
Not sure.
Edit: the closest thing I can find is r/bitcoin_nodes
@_date: 2019-12-19 23:19:36
At least it works lol
@_date: 2019-12-21 08:46:49
So I should use what I know for money? If so you’d be the second person in the past 12 hours to tell me that.
@_date: 2019-06-29 17:06:22
Awesome! Thanks! Just what I was looking for!
Edit: You gets updoot also
@_date: 2019-12-23 23:23:23
Then we shall force all users of all devices to have it.
@_date: 2019-12-23 22:45:57
But emojis are Unicode and standardized. If Apple makes a custom emoji it’ll just be a box on all other devices. You would have to petition the Unicode Consortium about it.
Edit: I do agree one is needed, but it’s up to a different power at play.
@_date: 2019-12-29 22:40:49
I feel like this is implying to people that crypto and its use are a crime. I mean, isn’t that what the banking system would want us to believe‽
