where is your source?

Yeah it definitely is now.  I assume as OP is alluding the space will move to drivechains to decentralize more, but would Rootstock themselves want that if they are rent-seeking on fees.

im sure governments can regulate nodes and mining pools.  that's not hard.

whats the time interval for the two bubbles -- 2014 to 2015 = 15 months?  We're now 9 months into the current one correct?

This would be true if utility to losses and gains were symmetry, but you have to take into account to loss aversion, to paraphrase, people are less willing to sell given larger losses because the pain is greater. So below breakeven, there will be many people who are going to hold out.

Interestingly enough, this would mean then that proof of stake does not benefit from this.

I think nothing at risk is a much more clearer name than nothing at stake.

doesn't answer a major problem with drivechain: miners now have external benefits to collude and centralize in order to funnel users to their sponsored sidechain.

You show bottom in mid-May.  It never reached 4800 in May.  Now Its Mid- to end of June, which is off the chart.  Is this still relevant?

Everyone has a certain set of beliefs in something.  Yours perhaps is belief in unverified scientific authority.

Really?  And Communist and Marxism which was entirely scientific (inspired by Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution) didn't put the world behind by decades?  This somewhat blind to actual short-term history.  We've had more human losses over these scientific ideologies in the 20th century than any other centuries combined before.  Stalin...Mao...

Appreciate the optimism, but I'm not completely convinced that Banks need to move to blockchain.  They can just drop their projects.  Its a nice to have, but doesn't have to happen.  They haven't taken enough stake in crypto yet to make me believe adding BTC will be a natural fit.  Remember for them to touch bitcoin, it has to have the blessings of the US government, which for the past 2 years has been more and more unfriendly.  Still hold the US government can just restrict banks from funding exchanges, isolate bitcoin, and use their own US digital currency to interoperate as a reserve between each of the bank's blockchains.  Welcome your thoughts back.

what is that rate of gold supply? eg. inflation rate.
@_date: 2018-11-16 19:48:13
right.  When I think about inflation; i'm more interested in supply side.  
@_date: 2018-11-24 16:11:02
If its 1/13/15 that means the last bubble went from high to low in 10 months?  We're something around 11 months...  
@_date: 2018-11-16 16:53:33
how are they different?
@_date: 2018-11-24 17:46:12


to see the highs and lows get less extreme would be very encouraging.
3 years means from one ATH to the next ATH?  or from low to new ATH?
@_date: 2018-11-15 21:33:49
So in 1.5 years Bitcoin inflation will = Gold's and also USD.

Sorry give me facts.  Not revisionist statements from what you learned in school.  How is a monetarist, who advocated for more central banking authority, and one that was opposed to the gold standard (eg. highly supported fiat currencies), a free-market proponent?  It may say he is free market, but he supported policies that we apparently not.  
If he was opposed to the Fed as he say later in his life, why didn't he spend his his greater academic career trying to reprimand it?

Can someone explain to me how most validating nodes is a better model for security, since any corporation and boot up 100k of nodes as a sybil attack?  Doesn't seem anymore a better determination than highest rate on a chain.

Cuts both ways.  Every dollar taken out of Bitcoin decreases by $50.  Although the downside is less likely to happen.
@_date: 2017-10-18 17:22:48
there is my point.  He still was a proponent of a single monopolized fiat issuance by some rules based authority.  Its not the free market governing the issuance, its some mathematical authority set by the institution.  Nor he did not advocate private competitive currencies as monetary policy or commodity currency like mises. He was a monetarist.  His policies of expanding the money supply was adopted widely by the federal reserve after the gold standard and has led us to the situation we are today.  BTW Milton's policies would have little effectiveness, unless fiat currency is monopolized.  Anytime people want to do QE or fiscal stimulation, Milton is WIDELY cited.    
@_date: 2017-10-18 17:16:51
he's a leaning free market proponent, but not the strongest.  The definition of free market means no government intervention.
free market is a system in which the prices for goods and services are determined by the open market and consumers, in which the laws and forces of supply and demand are free from any intervention by a government, price-setting monopoly, or other authority.
@_date: 2017-10-17 16:22:48
I know that's what the textbooks say, but he wasn't really a big believer in the free market.  He was a monetarist and advocated for expansion and contraction of the money supply by the federal reserve.  His theory that expanding money supply will increase wages is also put into doubt now because that is not occuring now.  We've expanded the supply and wages have not gone up.   
He never really advocated ending the FED, which you should if your free market, until his very old age, which is almost too late to have any impact.
@_date: 2017-10-18 17:17:59
its quite a similar circumstance.  The housing crisis also had a liquidity crunch which threatened the largest insitutions, precipitating the need for bailout.  
@_date: 2017-10-17 17:49:58
That's not true.  He supported QE for Japan.  Hardly does he mention his preference first for a rule-based policy.  he doesn't condemn the system, he proposes more of it during Japan's crisis. 
Friedman's Erroneous Critique of the Depression-Era Fed Opened the Door to Monetary Central Planning
In many respects, he was free-market, at least more than any other influential economists, but not a hard-lined laissez faire faire proponent we all think he is.  
@_date: 2017-10-17 18:25:08
These points are well taken, but advocating QE in Japan's case, does imply use of central expansion by an authority.  And even if he advocates a rule based monetary policy, an assumption has to be made by the implementors what is the appropriate level of expansion.  This has to be set in the algormitmn, which can be argued is a arbitrary value that is not relying on the market itself.  Although bitcoin is sort of the rule based monetary policy, the difference is that Milton wanted a high central authority to automatically do this.  He's still loosely conferring a need for a central bank.
Is his monetarist thesis not in doubt today?: higher expansion of money supply from 2008 QE, did not equate to higher wages and inflation.  We are somehow in a deflationary environment.
Also how is Basic Income / Negative Income Tax a free market policy?
@_date: 2017-10-18 20:56:57
Not according to all the definitions on the internet.  What do you think the free in free market means?  What is your definition?  Again it stands, he advocated for a central order, even if a mathematical algorithm, to be largest influencer of monetary policy, for the effect of increasing economic output and wages...
