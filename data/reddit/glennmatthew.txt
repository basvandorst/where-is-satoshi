GST was already paid for the Mars Bar when you bought it from the shop. 
Goods and services purchased offshore are GST exempt. Maybe Coinjar should just move to New Zealand. 
@_date: 2014-10-29 21:12:54
In most cases here, GST won't be applicable. You're spending in bitcoin, not selling bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-30 10:06:06
Which was my point... say a café buys Bitcoin to pay their bean supplier In Bitcoin, they would effectively not pay GST. It's the reason business quotes are usually GST ex.
@_date: 2014-10-04 06:32:11
Sure, it is "free" they just charge 2.95% to process a card.
@_date: 2014-09-30 09:49:30
It's not so bad. I did a 10min transaction for 1BTC yesterday. 
@_date: 2014-09-30 10:09:23
Did you block international transactions in the app? They should be enabled by default. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 09:24:17
It's ~~advertising~~ spam for a website called [Bitmessage Me]( - check the transaction notes.

At time of posting:
* bitcoinaverage: $363.46/btc
* Bitstamp: $362.96/btc
* Google calc: $359.13/btc
* Coinjar Fair Rate: $354.10
* **Circle is $365.52/btc**
All rates are USD.
@_date: 2014-09-30 10:06:43
Coinjar rate usually matches Bitstamp. What are you comparing it to?
@_date: 2014-11-05 07:32:00
I'm in Australia. The amount of bullshit compliance headaches the IRS has now caused us due to FACTA requirements is ridiculous. I'm sick of asking AUSTRALIANS "are you a U.S. citizen or tax resident as required by the FACTA Act."
It should be up to individual nation states to collect their data, not rely on private companies in foreign nations to collect it on their behalf.

I've seen reports of other Australians successfully use the same card from the same bank as me, it has worked for them, it hasn't worked for me.
@_date: 2014-09-30 09:48:12
Australian issued Visa? So far my NAB Visa Debit and Qantas Cash Card both failed verification. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 03:14:09
That email came from an escalated support ticket.
@_date: 2014-10-04 05:00:23
And I have not seen it once on their website, and I have double-checked since you mentioned it.
@_date: 2014-10-01 10:11:41
Yes! It's a bit detailed, but here's what I found.
1. I originally added my Visa Debit to Circle as a 'funding source' before attempting to add funds to my account. There is an authorisation on my Visa with a MCC 85, as far as I can tell, Circle attempted to put a credit on my card of $0.00
2. Every attempt to add funds after this point was 'denied' by Circle, but not 'declined' by NAB. In fact, not a single authorisation has been sent to NAB after the original authorisation.
So I've contacted Circle support, I'll see what happens from here.
@_date: 2014-09-30 11:49:20
My NAB Visa card is now on my account but it's declining the transaction. Available/clear funds in my account. I'll check NAB to check the decline reason tomorrow.
I also managed to successfully add a Bank of Queensland Visa Debit.
@_date: 2014-09-30 09:48:51
1. Cash economy. 
2. Buying offshore. 
@_date: 2014-10-29 21:09:00
FWIW, Circle don't have any of my personal info besides a throw-away phone number and my credit card. The service works fine for me...
@_date: 2014-10-04 04:21:36
Woohoo! My Australian 'Bank of Queensland' Visa Debit worked.
@_date: 2014-09-30 09:57:55
Coinjar is 2% to buy.
@_date: 2014-09-30 09:47:27
Nope. 
It only applies to 
"...certain goods you buy in Australia and then take out of Australia with you or in your checked luggage or carry-on bags."
@_date: 2014-11-03 07:43:22
I disagree. Netflix has 7000 titles in the US; HBO has about 12.
@_date: 2014-10-04 03:22:34
States policy where? It's not on their website, in their non-U.S. User Agreement. Please, enlighten us.
@_date: 2014-10-03 17:56:48
You need to learn to love the doge. 
100 doge verify 
@_date: 2014-10-29 21:14:34
In Australia, the banks will only response to card number, expiry date and verification code. Your name, address, etc are never confirmed by the bank due to privacy legislation.
I always use "First Last (name), 1 Main St, Sydney NSW 2000 (address)" for all online transactions and have never had a problem.
@_date: 2014-11-03 11:10:19
What are they suppose to do with the money? Track down the buyers and refund their drug money? :-|
@_date: 2014-10-04 05:14:26
No, it's like saying your Deskjet "officially" only supports HP cartridges after you bought the printer. From registration to now, there has been no notices on the Circle.com website that non-U.S. cards are not officially supported. I'm aware that other users are seeing this warning, I am not. I will post screenshots if you want.
@_date: 2014-10-04 06:49:02
No, Circle's bank charges them 2.95% (which I doubt, it would be &lt;1%) and they charge that to you.
It's basically a fee but they're getting away with saying it's free.
@_date: 2014-10-03 17:42:01
You only have the option of charging the card in USD, the AUD setting is just a reference point. 
So you'll pay Circle fee + up to 2.95% international transaction fee + Visa/Mastercard exchange rate. 
Personally, I'm still BPaying to Coinjar and just paying the GST. At least that tax goes back into the country and not foreign investors, banks and Visa/Mastercard. 
@_date: 2014-10-30 21:33:30
They can take a holding deposit in bitcoin, the same as a hotel takes a holding deposit in cash if you're paying with cash ;)
@_date: 2014-10-04 03:16:19
Circle doesn't support Australian banks, we can on only link Visa and Mastercard.
@_date: 2014-09-30 10:06:53
Debit or credit card?
@_date: 2014-10-05 03:00:09
I'm bidding $298

I joined Coinjar on Wednesday. I completed my ID using greenID, and it was successful immediately. I also completed my account verification.
I sent $10 from my NAB account to my Coinjar Filler at 10pm Wed, by Friday morning I raised a support ticket querying the delay, and the support team confirmed it had been received and cleared it immediately.
I then bought bitcoin, moved it to my coinjar, then moved it to a private bitcoin wallet. All happened within minutes!
I added another $10 tonight, from the NAB transfer to my private bitcoin wallet was a total of 3mins. Impressive.
I then moved $10 from my private wallet, back to my Coinjar wallet, then sold and withdrew it to my verified NAB account. Why it's not instantly sent across to my NAB account, since they bank with NAB, is interesting. It appears they do it as a single daily batch at COB each day. It's somewhat disappointing, I was hoping for a quicker movement of funds back and forth as needed.
Otherwise, impressed by the work.
@_date: 2014-10-04 11:02:05
If it works, it'll continue to work.
@_date: 2014-10-29 21:29:50
It depends what it is; we don't have freedom of speech.
@_date: 2014-10-05 18:40:04
It would stabilise the price if they didn't, though...
@_date: 2014-10-05 19:39:33
So early, you were on reddit for 11mins before writing that. 
@_date: 2014-09-29 15:22:12
SWIFT is the payment system. We don't use IBANs in Australia, it's just a combo of your BSB and account number. No support for us Aussies yet.
Also, I imagine the credit card transaction was a purchase, not a cash advance...
@_date: 2014-10-06 04:59:39
I'll hold you holding CeasefireX
@_date: 2014-09-30 09:36:36
I just got the email too. Immediately sent $1000 to the Coinjar Filler, it'll be my last Buy order through Coinjar :(
@_date: 2014-10-04 05:14:54
I just tried a different banks card and it worked :-\
@_date: 2015-01-12 01:41:04
The syncing does take a while, took about a week using the bootstrap torrent on my PC. Otherwise you can add your wallet.dat file to someone's fully synced node, just make sure you trust them first!
@_date: 2014-11-03 07:49:23
It's no different from any other proceeds of crime :-\
@_date: 2015-01-15 13:02:14
I missed the claim date :(
@_date: 2015-01-11 22:45:49
I'll trust my USD in there once they credit the $2000 SWIFT payment they received on 5 Jan 2015, still waiting for it to show up in my Bitstamp account!
I didn't vote you down.
@_date: 2015-01-12 01:50:41
1 cup of tea
@_date: 2014-09-30 09:44:24
The Coinjar article is a bit misleading. Technically GST registered businesses can claim the GST credits and effectively avoid paying GST. So the tax only applies to natural people and non-GST registered businesses. 
Or am I completely wrong?
@_date: 2015-01-09 23:33:42
Still no sign of a SWIFT deposit made 5 Jan. I had my bank do a trace, confirmed payment was credited to the Bitstamp account 5 Jan :(
@_date: 2015-01-12 02:08:05
Sure did. There's more than one problem that has been left unaddressed by the relaunch of Bitstamp, with continued zero communication.
@_date: 2015-01-15 03:29:14
Now sure why I just got this...
@_date: 2015-01-12 00:23:00
Can you do Paypal?
@_date: 2015-01-13 04:57:06
Oh yeh, fair point. Definitely American :P
@_date: 2015-01-12 00:27:24
Banking regulations? You mean American banking regulations? I wish you guys would stop thinking the world started at LA and finished at NYC. He's free to trade globally, the sellers jurisdiction applies.
@_date: 2015-01-12 00:19:24
The easiest solution will be moving the wallet.dat file into Bitcoin Core and having a look from there. Since you have a copy of the bootstrap, what problems are you having when starting Bitcoin Coin?
@_date: 2015-01-10 01:43:46
I'm not too worried. Just annoyed the deposit was processed and credited to their account before the site first went down, it usually clears ~6pm my time and the site went down a couple of hours later. Oh well.
@_date: 2015-01-10 02:18:39
Yeh. I'm sure their plate is full. It's just a few thousand dollars I'd prefer to have access to sooner than later :)
@_date: 2015-01-05 09:56:43
Bitstamp just took down their website.
@_date: 2015-01-14 07:50:45
I'll give you $50 for a bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-10 01:43:06
I did, they did a copy/paste and closed off my first ticket. I just opened a new one with more details requesting them to process the deposit to my account. See how we go.
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:15:58
Price is up ~10% and rising against XBT. Didn't see that coming.
@_date: 2015-01-12 00:16:22
What are your options to make payment for trade?
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:04:09
I'm just getting in early! :D
@_date: 2014-10-04 04:14:07
False, it says that in no section of my Circle account when adding a card. Screenshot?
@_date: 2015-01-12 01:54:20
What happens to the swift payments sent 7 days ago and are still to be credited to our accounts? I had my bank do a swift trace and they confirmed the funds were credited to Bitstamp's account on 05/01/15, still no sign of it though!
@_date: 2014-10-03 17:23:33
No, it just means they won't guarantee non-U.S. cards will work. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 07:41:05
It makes trading bitcoin as elusive as a government that keeps promises.
