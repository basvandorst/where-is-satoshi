Glad you like it now. That's the risk of buying in a highly volatile market. I don't really fault coinbase for that. They didn't hold your funds until the price was higher on purpose, that is preposterous. You were a week too late, tbh.
Probably best to let it go and not let something like that color your future decisions in this space. What matters is that the whole space is maturing and this year has been huge for progress on that front.

Why didn't you just deposit cash to pro? That's how you avoid fees.
Sounds like you just didn't do your homework. Also, are you buying now? Because this is an opportunity you say you have been waiting for...

They are not known for being shady fuckers. The only people that say that are in the extreme minority. That loud minority blasts their opinion on crypto social media and it gets amplified.

How long ago are you talking about?
Depositing in GDAX/Coinbase Pro for no fees has been an option since, at least, last summer when I started using it.

My parents are in their 60’s, not retired yet, and they pay 40k per year for healthcare.
Also, other countries don’t pay 25% more taxes than us. You are just ignorant and making shit up to protect your own worldview.
@_date: 2019-12-04 19:58:01


But we aren't healthier. In fact, we are sicker and die sooner than all those other countries.


You don't have a choice to be healthy, though. Everyone gets sick. And when you do get sick, you will pay WAY more out the ass than you would have if you just paid a little more tax now for healthcare.

Personal property =\= private enterprise
@_date: 2019-12-04 19:53:34
You have no fucking clue what you are talking about.
Socialism doesn't mean "tax and regulate."
@_date: 2019-12-05 02:10:14
You are confusing the two. Bitcoin enables you to keep your wealth as personal property, away from private enterprises that seek to make profit from your property
@_date: 2019-12-04 19:51:33
And we can show that over time that property ends up in the hands of the few and that you are absolutely not entitled to all the fruits of your labor. That's where profit comes from.

Galaxy brain shit right here.
Healthcare outcomes are not related to healthcare? You know what doctors do in other countries? They work with their patients to get them healthier. That means working on diet and other life choices with them.
In our system, there is no incentive for doctors to get people healthier or to prevent illness. There is incentive to make us return customers. 
You want to talk about incentive? Let’s talk about profit-motive.
People are dying because they are rationing insulin. 30 year olds dying because they don’t want to burden their family with bills.
You are starting with an answer and then working backward so that you aren’t wrong.
@_date: 2019-12-04 21:59:26
You make no sense and have no idea what socialism is.
Show me any government without regulation and taxes.
@_date: 2019-12-05 00:38:40
This is patently false. You have it literally backwards.
@_date: 2019-12-04 19:54:52


The US pays twice as much for healthcare than those other countries. So, we pay that 20-30% in taxes and then we have to pay another 20% to insurance and hospitals, etc.


This is patently false. Even in the lowest tax states.

Bitcoin enables *personal* ownership. Not private.
Private ownership is when the bank holds all your money privately and doles out only what can make them profits.

Diabetes isn’t health related????
Sorry dude but you’re a fucking idiot.

Hey, if you’re going to use leverage, only risk a tiny % of your margin per trade.
Manage your risk.

But hey, also, don’t fucking short bitcoin. It’s not going to zero and the potential upside is limitless
