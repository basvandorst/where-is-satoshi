Good to see the price a little above 4K. Great to hear all the exciting news around lightning more, though!

Great idea, but I think this can be refined further. Would you be able to create a couple of more for the internet to choose from?

There are plenty of good jobs out there. You need to find a company that’s not so stricken with greed. I have heard zero stories of people getting rich from Uber. I would also research living expenses, because the mid west is much cheaper to live compared to something like Seattle WA.

This, in my opinion, has ruined bitcoin for me. Why care about an increased value if your having to deal with taxes on every purchase? Having to figure this out every time is what is holding me back from getting a further percentage into bitcoin. The laws must change!

Not pointless. Thank you for your insight. I, too, believe that there is so much as stake with Crypto and Bitcoin.

I lol’d at this one

But what does the document say?! I find it amusing that bankers would be reading about Dogecoin in a serious manner.

My coworkers all think that Bitcoin is a pyramid scheme. What is the point in arguing with them? What can I say that truly makes them think that Bitcoin is more than just that?

No worries Shokaaa. I’m down by about 50% of what I put in. I know others have it worse. Bitcoin is not cruel, but big banks are.

I live in the USA. Say I spend some of my bitcoin at Overstock.com. How do I calculate capital gains tax? Do I have to do this for every purchase? Do the majority of people even pay capital gains tax, or are they just taking a big risk with the IRS?

Coming from a noobie who wants BTC to grow, I think that this will be the biggest hurdle to overcome. The fact that we cannot use BTC like fiat makes me feel trapped. Even if I wanted to spend it, I end up not because I'll have to figure out all the taxes. I don't believe mass adoption in the USA will occur until the tax laws change. Too complex for the average Joe.

The government can put you in prison. I wouldn't play with fire.

Came here to say this. I've done a very small amount of learning about bitcoin myself. It was enough to convince me that a cryptocurrency is the future. Bitcoin has the largest name in the game currently, but doesn't mean it always will.

This was clever
