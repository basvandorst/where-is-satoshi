Paxful.com = best p2p in the game!

Great points. Never thought about it that way. I always thought about it the other way around.

They've also got great 24/7 customer support (which is a HUGE plus)

A lot of people say that keeping your bitcoin on exchanges is very unsafe (can't really agree or disagree with that just said since I'm fairly new to crypto) but at the same time, I believe that there are genuine exchanges out there that actively try to keep user money safe. I've trusted my exchange with my money ever since I started trading.

I prefer Paxful! They have over 300 methods of payment and their 24/7 customer support is great.

move to paxful
@_date: 2018-05-16 07:57:25
I think Paxful is the way the to go. It's very reliable in my opinion.

Awesome! Great to hear that the little guy is being looked after.

Hmmm... Never tried Paxful but I think I'll give it a shot now.

I prefer Bitcoin but I don't think any of them are better than the other. I guess it becomes preference at this point.

I would believe that when it comes to peer-to-peer platforms, I would narrow it down to Localbitcoins and Paxful. LBC is good, but I prefer Paxful.

Yup. The Paxful wallet is good enough to store your bitcoin in until you're ready to pay for a more protected wallet.

Well, I think that they've only banned exchanges. What they DIDN'T ban was peer-to-peer Bitcoin marketplaces! The only P2P platform I know is Paxful, I mean... I use it and it's done well for me. Good people over in India should check it out.

I believe in Bitcoin more than I do in God
