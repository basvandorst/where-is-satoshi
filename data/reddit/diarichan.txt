it's stuck between 9.2 and 9.4k
@_date: 2019-07-11 20:44:40
Really? I made a lot of profit with bitcoin so, I don't really care anymore
I became homeless because of bitcoin but after waiting it out now I'm traveling like crazy and paying my friends food, giving money to other homeless etc
And my wallet feels bottomless (^･ｪ･^)
Why did I have success? Because I never sold.
@_date: 2019-07-16 20:08:37
tomorrow some very rich guy may buy Bitcoin and it spikes to 10k again, followed by more rich guys buying it causing it go 12k then 15k, alts crushed 
or whales just getting bored and gradually getting rid of their Bitcoins and we may see it drop 8k, 7.5k, 7.... but I believe bottom will be around 5k  
nobody really knows!!!! but everyone has hope.
@_date: 2019-07-21 23:25:56
i didnt buy more till break even, i believed bitcoin would never recover. had i invested when it was 3k i was settled for life
btw why downvote you motherfucker, i'm telling my story based on truth
@_date: 2019-07-11 21:14:13
F*ck all these whales commenting on my post and trying to scare us. Hold your coins, don't fear, never fear. ��������

funny how as i started to travel in march april  2019 it went up and now in 2 days i finish my asia trip it declines by 35%

dont worry dont be negative

@_date: 2019-07-21 00:51:31
its still not 10k euros
@_date: 2019-07-21 16:50:04
i entered in around june 2018, after it dropped steadily. around 2019 may finally break even, and now im in the green.
but i dont like seeing this chart, basically everyone is working together to get the price going up up up
and then one person is just like nononono������������ go down ������
shouldnt we all work together to bring bitcoin to the sky because the better bitcoin fares the more people will get interested in it
win win situation for us poor guys as well as the rich guys
we can travel the world and buy our girlfriends nice presents
and the whales can buy some nice flashy cars and houses made of gold
@_date: 2019-07-31 19:42:42
i got double entry visa so
i already used once to see her
why the downvotes
@_date: 2019-07-27 16:02:44
i bought at 6.9k? yes and then it dropped immediately
i never expected it to recover, so didnt buy
but had i bought at 3k, then atm i would be millionaire

Sorry I'm not a lottery dealer

so i saved 5 years put half of my savings in btc when it was 9000 10000, im still in green but its getting dangerous
@_date: 2019-07-11 20:52:56
I do, never sell your btc no matter what, just sell everything you have including your clothes, house, car, whatever put it in bitcoin and wait. Save some for sleeping pills and antidepressants though. If bitcoin can drop all the way to 3k, then recover back to 13k then I know enough, in 2 years it will probably reach up to 20k, 30k, and people will say ''shittttttt why didnt i buy at 10k!!!!'''
@_date: 2019-07-31 18:04:14
pls go back 12k i want to sell some bitcoin to go to asia again and meet my chinese girlfriend
please��god, universe, satoshikun
@_date: 2019-07-20 13:29:16
funny it spikes up by about +100, then suddenly drops again
some whale really trolling us
@_date: 2019-07-02 06:00:10
Often when it drops sharply people will panic sell so don't be surprised if it drops to 4 or 5k then spikes to 20 in a few hours
(Not talk about today)
@_date: 2019-07-21 23:35:14
never sold any bitcoin. i bought in at 7k, then bought a lot at 7k 8k 10k
i will sell when it reaches 30k
@_date: 2019-07-19 10:27:48
some of those are incurable but it cant be compared because even if btc value drops to  0 it can still reach 100000
@_date: 2019-07-27 12:58:14
i didnt sell

I invested my lifesavings in btc when it was 7k euro, now it plummeted to 5.5k. But I believe btc will rise again. Btc learned me that to get rich, constantly buy and sell, not Wait. For me I cannot sell otherwise it will be a huge loss. Waiting for the bull to come in christmas.

@_date: 2018-08-01 22:27:31
I expect it to drop more, then suddenly spike to 8 or 9k. But I wonder if I should buy more btc now, its so risky
@_date: 2018-08-05 14:45:34
I have the feeling those who want to buy bitcoin try to make us scared and drop all our bitcoin, so companies can buy them in large scale
But yeah more and more companies are offer ing bitcoin payments so it will be ok
@_date: 2018-08-26 05:51:00
It will be at 5 to 6k by then still, and the hodlers who bought a bitcoin when it was above 10k will still be making silly memes on this sub
I will be hodling
@_date: 2018-08-15 20:20:11
I bought when it was 8200 usd... I will have to hold 3 years I guess, will never be that high. Sigh. Fuck me.

Buy some land in China or Japan, build a tall hotel, help poor people on streets by making a bitcoin mining shelter, they have to guard the computers, maybe make a cheap restaurant that sells only basic supplies like water and rice, and meet people  on internet to sleep with, but this time I'm rich so I have more success. Oh and make a turn based RPGs like classic final fantasy 1 to 10 days
Definitely  not going to marry haha
But if I have kids they're all going to be rich as well
@_date: 2019-08-09 07:17:00

@_date: 2019-08-07 12:12:12
Nah I think investors look at how long a price stays at same point and if it doesn't  do anything  for a long time they decide to sell (if its high), also they know what we are thinking, when it goes up we tend to buy, when it goes down we sell
The 3000 mark stayed for almost half year? Then of course it's a good sign it's the bottom and theres where things escalated
Imagine buying at 3k, your investments would've been tripled by now
@_date: 2019-08-15 04:10:01
That's just the beginning��
Will drop all the way down to maybe 4k
Then I rebuy
I sold all my bitcoin now. ��

Great insomnia is back. My best friend kept saying to me sell it sell it sell when it was 10900 euro.
Then I think, fine.......
Then it suddenly!!! went down to 10500
Ok it will recover, let's wait.
Then 10200, ok let's sell  but my coinbase needs verification because  my 2fa app got deleted, different phone. 
Then I make account on different  exchange
Then Bammmm 9600...9000....8900 down down down yes fuck me. 
Fuck me hard ��. Harder oh yes oh yes ah  more more!drop it to 0 yes ah ��❤❤❤. I got raped by whales makes me so aroused. But in a few days I can creampie my Chinese gf again. I have less than 1k fiat... hope it recovers a bit so I can sell btc, a little, for travel.

@_date: 2019-08-05 20:29:11
Just so interesting to see it go down 9k, 8k
People people YouTube all making these negative predictions and then a few weeks later full above 10k again
I feel very positive now
Bitcoin feels so good because  both poor and rich can benefit from it, it's a beautiful way to share wealth 
And if you can time the market consider yourself free from any job 
but nobody can predict it because  how will you predict someone buying or selling something?
@_date: 2019-08-14 08:50:19
To make matters worse, can't sell btc because coinbase needs verification, lost 2fa. uploaded passport and selfie and error now locked out 24 hours 
Better sell now like whales do and rebuy when it's 8.5k or so
Sell again at 12k resistance etc

I also thought it was the end
exactly that moment when you're so desperate you want to seppuku, is the time it will go up
@_date: 2019-08-28 23:29:09

then next morning 15k and start smashing their keyboard in the toilet

But I think we have reached the real price of bitcoin, and will slowly build up.
This fake 12k pump dump was caused by those plustoken criminals if I got the information  right. So we dont need to worry much :)
@_date: 2019-08-09 09:28:09

trying to make us desperate and sad      
but I know true holders will never give in    
yes horrible insomnia, and I cant even afford to treat girls because all my money is locked in btc   
instead of flying,  I ride night trains   
instead of eating at a restaurant I order rice and buy canned fish   
and my traveling is over   
guess it's time for winter sleep,  like a bear, wait for next years halving  
somehow I lost my s.. drive as well  
even if btc drops to minus zero  
it can still recover  and bounce back  
I lost a lot! but when I think of people who bought at last time ath 20000? its bearable
@_date: 2019-06-22 18:52:25
I'd made a lot of profit if I'd sell but that'd be really retarded. I decide to hodl until it's 30 or 40k, even if it'd take 10 years.
@_date: 2019-08-05 20:35:17
So I should sell now that I'm the green?
@_date: 2019-08-19 08:05:28
So I slept a bit, woke up, got an erection. Then 5 mins later I looked at the charts and saw it going up.
So it means we need 5 more erections to get it back at 12k.

That it drops just before my fiat is finished is a bit scary. Right now at my friends house till 16 then plane to china with 500 on my cc and 1110 on my bank account
@_date: 2019-06-08 07:53:05
Even if it goes down to zero, who says it cannot recover?
Your investment could magically decuple or centuple and BTC could go up to 70k or 700k eur (I won't say 1000k, that's too cliche). What, keep my savings on the bank and never use it, or invest it and feel exhilarated when it goes up?
And a girl (now we are enemies because I called her gold digger) said to her friends ''this guy controls the bitcoin'' I felt so awesome
@_date: 2019-06-04 02:03:59

Love bitcoin. Store it in a private wallet and it's fully under your control. No government or bank can touch it. Instead of keeping your savings in a bank and never use it, you can spend it on bitcoin, and in the long term it may double even, but then still hodl. Always hodl and just buy it when it temporarily goes down. It really is magic money of the Internet.

Maybe it's a cute Japanese woman in a black thong wearing a black mask, who went to aokigahara to commit suicide, but found a man writing B on a tree and his last words were only you can change the world. She bought many sex toys and started fantasizing on her bed. All kind of math formulas in her head. The next morning  she had a dream where someone said ''you are a bit...'' and woke up, with a coin next to her. She didn't go outside for months and made bitcoin. Now all she had to do was to play with her toys till we made it a valuable asset. Now all governments will go down and one day she will stand on top of tokyo sky tree and show herself naked and send a warning signal to all phones with her bitcoin private keys and everyone is rich and happy

Hire two bodyguards, enter hotel room.  Have them carry a locker where the money is inside. Ask person to come, and ask clerk if hes alone or with who and to identify them.
When everything is ok, let enter hotel room, lock it. Then let count money, and do everything they want. If all ok let send bitcoin, then trade is finished. If hardware wallet, put in same locker, go home, use two different taxis, finish.
Only you know the code of locker so nobody can do anything.

I didnt sell it yet lol. I hodled for a year and will hodl. Had small problems with a Taiwanese woman caused me a depressive dip and see the world in a negative way. I still believe in bitcoin ( ´･ω ก` )
@_date: 2019-05-10 11:19:36
I can afford another 1 btc, but it took me many years to save it up...
@_date: 2019-05-19 20:50:48
Nobody does, nobody can guess when the rich people will sell and cause a crash, or invest and rises so shut up 
If it weren't for that one person making it break 8k it would still be at 7.2k it's barely moving.
@_date: 2019-05-30 23:19:36
I don't care anymore, crashes like these often signify a bull run incoming. Just hodl and never sell.
@_date: 2019-05-29 05:01:25
Bull run inc. Time to lock &amp; load
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:43:19
It crossed my break even 
One year of insomnia and pain
finally rewarded
Hodl!!!! And buy more
@_date: 2019-05-14 09:35:10
Brb gonna buy more btc ��
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:52:40
But it also climbs back fairly quickly in less than 30 min, don't you think?
@_date: 2019-05-11 23:26:05
Stop it already, till i can pour more money in monday 。・°°・(＞_＜)・°°・。
@_date: 2019-05-17 11:20:23
Nobody would predicted that one whale had such authority
@_date: 2019-05-17 18:41:08
If I sell now I have about 1.6k loss, but I seriously got enough of this. Should have sold at the 8500 peak. I'm retarded.
@_date: 2019-05-31 04:38:48
Previously I'd panic, but now I don't give a F*** buy when it goes low and never sell when at loss. Whether 1 year or 10 years it will eventually go to the moon.
@_date: 2019-05-17 04:00:51
You're holding your phone upside down
@_date: 2019-05-17 12:44:29
@_date: 2019-05-04 02:12:04
Yes but i wont buy more i bought a huge sum at 8k and still waiting to recover
@_date: 2019-05-17 11:16:35
@_date: 2019-05-18 18:58:27
Bitcoin was already dead, that it pushed 8k was just bare luck
feel sorry for those who invested when it was 10k+
@_date: 2019-05-14 02:45:05
Not going to hodl till I'm an impotent grand pa haha
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:40:38
Btc also dropped from 16.5 to 14.5k between 7 - 11 december before it climbed ath. No worries.
@_date: 2019-05-11 03:29:23
Yep too late, but I will Still buy
@_date: 2019-05-10 10:29:56
I bought around May and still in the loss, however, I have the feeling we won't see cheap bitcoin again so I want to invest my newly accumulated savings... 
But I feel very uneasy
@_date: 2019-05-09 09:11:02
Everytime bitcoin goes up I treat someone because I feel so happy.
@_date: 2019-05-18 01:26:54
Buy at 7k, sell at 7.4k, repeat. The market is stuck between those two prices.
@_date: 2019-05-14 01:37:00
I prefer longevity (like not having to work all my life and playing with beautiful people I meet on Tinder) over a car I will probably not use ⊂((・x・))⊃ but buying one, playing with it and selling it later is also an option (●´ω`●)
@_date: 2019-05-19 20:54:28
It just hurts when I bought 1 year ago and it kept going down, now I'm close to recovering and then you see it dropping again
it's like a pregnant wife who gets a car accident while being brought to the hospital to give birth to a child 
sorry insomnia here
@_date: 2019-05-17 02:20:53
Really wish it would at least go to 9k so I can say farewell to bitcoin
How depressing waking up to 8k since Tuesday
@_date: 2019-05-18 18:44:23
No it didnt
It's stuck between 7 and 7.3k since the crash
@_date: 2019-05-03 16:06:05
Wish i bought more when it was cheaper
@_date: 2019-05-18 18:49:52
Sell whatever bitcoin you have now, even if you're at a loss. Whales are laughing at us. Bitcoin will not reach 8k for another year. 
It will drop, then buy that dip and hodl. 
Stuck between 7 ～ 7.2k and trading volume decreasing as well
@_date: 2019-05-16 10:20:05
A lot of movement here. Old hodlers in their break even who gotten enough of it and newcomers who want to get a quick buck. In my case I reached my break even but made no profit yet. Depressed.
@_date: 2019-05-11 11:33:45
I don't agree. You could invest your lifesavings and get two options: either you become very rich and probably won't need to work for a while or you lose everything. Even if bitcoin falls it will recover, I think much faster next time, because people have shown that even if it drops to the bottom it has potential to enter bull mode. I wish I bought at those low 3k, how stupid I was.
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:42:47
I'm going to focus on traveling instead :)
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:06:25
Break even, buy one whole bitcoin, then crash. Fu'ck my life haha
@_date: 2019-05-17 19:36:59
I had break even at 8.1k, then I bought a whole bitcoin, then this crash. Now I have insomnia, depression, and feeling really down. I couldn't enjoy my date yesterday. I cannot sleep, just looking at charts and twitter about btc. I mean I expected a quick recovery if this was really a bull run. But nothing is happening. This bitcoin price is manipulated by a few whales, and now I know this I'm really scared to continue being victimized by them. I'll probably wait a week, if it doesn't go up to 8k then it means return of bear market, and I really cannot be arsed to wait another year just to see my 1-2k return.
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:07:08
No shitcoin talk here get out
@_date: 2019-05-18 01:06:04
Probably money laundering / stolen bitcoin and wanted to exit before he got caught
@_date: 2019-05-17 11:17:44
Indeed not healthy
@_date: 2019-05-14 00:23:59
Good morning from Taiwan
@_date: 2019-05-11 00:53:34
It crashed as soon as I bought it , so... I still feel unsure. But this time very bullish
@_date: 2019-05-30 23:21:15
The whale who did this really doesn't like Anime, huh
@_date: 2019-05-20 13:08:20
Take some antidepressants and hodl
Thats all i can say
@_date: 2019-05-20 13:14:11
Tomorrow (May 21)
 but can be delayed till Oct. 
75% chance delayal, 24,9 chance rejection, 0.1 chance approval
@_date: 2019-05-11 12:45:18
Entered around 8k
@_date: 2019-05-13 00:08:09
But 600 decrease in 16 hours is a lot, I'm scared that I won't break even in 8k, and want to panic sell...
@_date: 2019-05-21 13:24:28
Cant go 0 many bitcoins lost plus people will hodl more and more
@_date: 2019-05-18 18:57:16
It'll never go that high again.
Whales manipulate it in such a manner that it stays below 8k and newcomers who push the price up diminish (24h traded btc) then it will go sideways and either another rich person will notice it and buy but most probable scenario is that previous whales will think ''see you'' and causing a massive crash.
@_date: 2019-05-18 00:49:09
I sold 15% at recent 7.4k spike. Still at a loss though. If it drops below 7 I will invest that 15% again.
@_date: 2019-05-18 00:33:09
People change to fiat: decrease
People buy btc: increase
Large increase: someone with big money
Currently I think new people are buying bitcoin while rich are slowly changing to fiat
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:50:10
Easy, people see it rising and regain their faith in bitcoin. I have to buy now or else I will be too late, they think. Then it raises again and more people think the same.
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:16:22
Im finally on my breakeven and bought moar bitcoin. ( ´･ω ก` )
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:23:28
Almost break even. Almost.
@_date: 2019-05-23 09:50:53
Nothing to see here, buy the dips, hodl.
@_date: 2019-05-13 02:34:28
Okay I will hodl. But have a bad feeling about this. I feel it will be like this for a long time, or steadily decrease.
