My Bread wallet has been confirming for nearly 2 weeks now. It still hasn't completed. Do I have to wait for the confirmations to come in before I can send the funds to another wallet? Anyone know?

That's bs!

That's why the real worry is actually about the disruption BTC will have one the financial industries. And not that it's a bubble! IMO

Where does one go to learn about block size limits, hard forks, and other Bitcoin info? Anyone have a good resource? Or is there a Bitcoin for dummies book?

Don't worry. I'm Canadian ;)

When is this potentially happening?

Last time Bitcoin forked we all got Bitcoin cash from it, so why is another fork bad? Won't we all get more cryptos out of the fork? More value?

How do you calculate savings rate percentages?

Yes it is possible that if your computer is infected or if you are online while you view your keys or print them that they can be compromised.

I once asked a developer and his answer, in not the greatest English, was... " I have tested that you can first import the coin private key with a mobile wallet (I used Mycelium Bitcoin wallet). Then make a Bitcoin transaction with the wallet to an another address. Not needed thou, but then you have to trust the BCC wallet that It does not steal your Bitcoins.
Then I selected "export private key" from the Mycelium and inserted the key to a BCC wallet (I used Electron cash. A fork from Electrum). With Electron Cash you can send the BCC tokens to another BCC address" 
Edit: I haven't tired it yet so I don't know if it works. Not sure if this helps you. If you figure it out It'd be sweet. Maybe someone else knows
