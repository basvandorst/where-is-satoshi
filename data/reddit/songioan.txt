Can someone explain how the sidechain technology and Lightning Network can process millions of transactions per second?
The author wrote, "Commercial banks can trivially con_gure their existing computer systems to accommodate Bitcoin alongside the USD. Customers could then use the same banking services as always (checking accounts, credit cards, home equity loans), but with Bitcoin as the unit of account. In this model [12], the blockchain would only be used for large settlement transactions between banks.
However, such a model is only attractive if users have an alternative available to them in the form of
the blockchain itself. Fortunately, in practice the blockchain network is likely to be quite scalable. As
previously mentioned, Bitcoin can take advantage of sidechain technology [45] to access the blockspace of new blockchain networks. Since it can create an unlimited number of these, the e_ective blockspace of the network is also unlimited. In addition, a technology called the \lightning network" [33] enables Bitcoin to cache an arbitrarily unlimited number of transactions to a single blockchain ledger entry. Between these two technologies, the Bitcoin network can handle millions of transactions per second (in contrast, VISA could handle only 40,000 tps as of the year 2013 [47])."

How about using atomic swap with LTC? Basically you can use LTC as a transporter for faster and cheaper transactions

If bitcoin fork WOULD occur and create BTC (supported by Bitcoin Core) and BTU (supported by Bitcoin Unlimited),
1. will Exodus support both BTC (will become XBT, I believe) and BTU?
2. are Exodus wallets protected from a Replay Attack?

Sorry for asking a stupid question. Is Exodus a cold wallet that can generate paper (wallet) records?

Gemini asked me for my social security during the application process. I don't recall Coinbase has asked for my SS. Can anyone confirm?
