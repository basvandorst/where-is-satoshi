Exactly, people that have zero basic concepts of free marketplaces and only out for themselves.
The minute they make one bad trade they look for excuses to blame.  Never realizing that maybe the trade they first initiated was well above their risk tolerance.
Then you will get the people who think its rigged or fake, price goes up too much so emotions kick in and they FOMO, then their trade dips and they freak out and want people to be jailed.
People who should be jailed are the bankers of 2008 not people that run an unregulated bitcoin exchange.
People have lower risk tolerance than they think and absolutely terrible risk management.

I like you, its to bad you are debating with someone who self admitted he hasn't even looked into anything critically and also has zero tech bsckground.
Kudos for spreading well informed logic backed with facts.

Your limited relationships compared to others is nothing, I'm in my 30s but personally know 5 people over the age of 60 that hold bitcoin as a 1% high risk of their portfolio.

Maybe because the history of diamonds is one big marketing ploy and nothing to do with traditions.
Its good to use bitcoin for sure, but diamond rings are so 1930s.

Yeah which I agree with.  Always fun to question why certain "traditions" make us happy, especially expensive ones.

Many things have similarities that may not be relevant.

This guy just said exactly what has been on my mind lately !! Great Vid!!
I find it so ironic people investing in crypto are crying for regulation!! What.. the.. fuck?!?

Yes, we agree.
Why is your solution to let a small number of people filter that out for me?  I can do that myself.  Uninitiated investors have no effect on the marketplace as a whole.  Ignorant people investing in technology they don't understand don't need to be saved.  
Don't invest in what you don't understand.
Don't invest what you can't afford to lose.
Investing 101.  No one needs a regulator to tell them otherwise, that is common public knowledge.
All you do is create hoops for people who want to create ICO's to jump through which will only give more power to people who already have a certain reputation or a certain amount of money.
Do you not see any problem with how IPO's work now?
