Insider trading? Big news may be coming out today.
@_date: 2014-01-29 04:18:03
Do you have a graph with the last 14 years included?
@_date: 2014-07-10 15:48:36
Is the world's political climate ready to adopt such a technology for a new reserve-currency?
@_date: 2014-10-29 18:27:20
Not supported in Firefox! What?!
@_date: 2014-08-22 18:46:18
Probably people pulling their BTC out of Bitstamp.
@_date: 2014-07-17 15:44:24
The reception of this news on and is of night and day difference.
@_date: 2014-06-09 05:19:45
How sentimental. This sub is my home these days.
@_date: 2014-02-28 20:26:14
I noticed in my Multibit app the price shown relates to the Gox current price (stuck around $135). Maybe there are preferences so you can link that price-point to another exchange.
@_date: 2014-06-04 14:24:07
What if you have 3 btc at gox that are currently worth around $2000, but a new bubble in a month or two could push that to a worth of over $10,000?
The 3 gox coins aren't under my control anymore, so getting penalized for something I have no access to as of now is utter bullshit.
@_date: 2014-06-17 12:15:07
How long until you can use a credit card for BTC instead of fiat?
@_date: 2014-06-17 15:28:48
No, I'm wondering if BTC credit will be a thing someday. Like a Visa or Mastercard system that deals in BTC rather than US dollars.
@_date: 2014-03-03 05:47:00
What tax purposes will our account histories have? 
@_date: 2014-02-28 20:23:55
I wonder if any regulation will come of this. Not gov't regulation, but protocol amendment. Can't we as a community make stolen BTC a non-issue?
@_date: 2014-02-10 12:38:06
Yeah, this holding of withdrawals and such so gox can catch up to the rest with their protocol was no reason to cause a near 50% drop.
@_date: 2014-02-07 02:27:12
Happy cakeday.
But gox is the only exchange dipping 25%. The others have been fairly resilient. What price would the Toronto ATM reflect? The crashing gox price? Or something more stable?
@_date: 2014-12-31 11:55:10
@_date: 2014-02-07 02:10:00
No one can see into the future. But I cashed out a week ago 'cause I was pissed how high the gox price had gotten. :)
@_date: 2014-02-04 21:14:15
Is it really no longer an option? I just setup a checking account and it says it's been in the validation stage for the past week. I just wish they still had Dwolla.
@_date: 2014-07-13 00:12:24
Are you suggesting Chinese people shouldn't be able to have Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-03-03 05:41:16
I have... a *theory* (yes, I know that word is turning into a source of contempt), but here it is. That Yubi Key thing that Gox sells could be seen as a viable source of income by the bankruptcy advisors. Maybe Gox will require users to buy a Yubi Key to access their Gox funds in the future, as a form of security and a source of income for Gox's repayment plans.
EDIT: I've gathered from Reddit that Gox plans on having a "good" update within the next few hours. Maybe this is connected with that.
@_date: 2014-03-04 00:10:12
I lost 3 BTC. Is it worth joining a lawsuit?
@_date: 2014-05-21 23:38:50
Does anyone know where to get the form for filing a proof of claim? Preferably in English.
@_date: 2014-02-27 06:53:59
So, that's that. I hope Mark feels remorse and does all he can to come into the light and make this as right as he can make it.

Looks like subscriber lists can't be viewed, even by mods.

So if you like a company you can convert btc and put it with them to sit there as an alt currency, one of a million others, fluctuating with the company's public image?
Do these companies get anything for gaining more of their alt-coin? Or is it just a way to 'vote' with your money even though your vote count isn't limited to one casting, but instead to as many coins as you're willing to convert over into 'votes.' Seems like manipulation could happen easily.
I see how btc being the lowest denominator (most liquid and stable) of currencies means most will just keep their monies in btc, but I fail to see how this will make stock-like investing mainstream. I like some companies, and sure, I'd throw some small change into a business I think they deserve to expand, but I won't hold Google coin 'cause I know it's not gonna go up or down - they've reached their critical mass - so why not just hold btc if it's all the more safer. Most people pay someone to do this investing. And the colored coins won't change that sentiment. But it's a system that makes value more convenient and centralized with btc as the anchor. The strongest anchor I can think of.
**I just spent like 30 mins on this comment. I'd like to know what you're thinking. I too was high today (acid) and thought a lot about vote casting via internet and other fun stuff.
@_date: 2014-02-02 04:22:50
So in a way, money is no longer an issue in your life. That's awesome and I hope to feel the same way eventually. I try. But it's hard when you're not rich as hell.
@_date: 2014-01-31 00:00:04
Once mt.gox allows easy dollar withdrawl, I have a feeling the inflated mt.gox price will drop back into parity with the other exchanges... maybe even cause a dip in the bitcoin market overall.
@_date: 2014-02-10 09:17:36
Wow, it's happening.
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:16:45
Or the DOJ could give them to those burned by Gox, as a gesture of nationalistic nepotisim.

Don't forget how fast this Reddit community has grown [lately.](
And 2,000 more within the last week.

It seems there was a criteria countries needed to satisfy in order to join the EU, basically be of good economic standing.
Bitcoin has been *allowed* into many countries, and Bitcoin holders are encouraged to use the currency in order to increase adoption.
@_date: 2014-02-07 06:35:19
Could you explain in layman's terms what a "1W MACD crossover" means?
@_date: 2014-03-23 20:47:02
Don't these coins belong to those who had BTC on Gox?
@_date: 2014-08-14 00:49:35
Those who have connections within legislatures and/or corporations that the average Bitcoin user doesn't.
@_date: 2014-06-09 06:47:15
We doubled from 60k to 120k subscribers thanks to the November 2013 bubble. I'm sure the next bubble will put into the top 100 or 50 subs.
@_date: 2014-05-25 09:55:40
I think the peak will be a little higher, like 4,500
@_date: 2014-02-28 20:19:34
There are sure to be some BTC in a personal wallet of Karpeles' somewhere.
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:47:49
Send me three, please. I want my poor bitcoin back.
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:42:34
Maybe we go to the US govt for help. Right? ^^Right? ^^^^Right!?
@_date: 2014-02-06 02:31:09
Apple is probably getting paid big by someone to do this
@_date: 2014-10-30 07:02:07
I got a message that said Chrome and Safari are the ones.
@_date: 2014-02-22 19:36:15
What could be causing them to have 62 confirmations thus far?
@_date: 2014-02-28 20:16:06
I've seen some people say in this sub that BTC doesn't sit under that capital gains loss umbrella. I'm still gonna try it. Who knows? Maybe the U.S. will start regulating BTC and pay our tax returns in optional BTC in the future. :)

Will Bitcoin holders be paid back in Bitcoin? That way there's no value lost if the price per Bitcoin goes through a new adoption phase or two.
@_date: 2015-05-25 00:47:38
Black and grey bitcoins will always be sought after but have slightly less purchasing power. And people will just have two wallets - one for legal activities, the other for illegal.
@_date: 2014-06-11 15:04:07
Yeah, I'm sure most business convert straight to USD when they get a BTC payment. But there are more and more businesses that will store them to use for future purchases or to hold as an investment.
@_date: 2015-01-14 05:30:30
That's really interesting. You sold any?
@_date: 2017-02-27 18:34:58
Competition is a good thing.
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:44:18
We can't seem to get over the hurdle that the government is there to serve us. Who cares if they don't want to get their hands on Bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-11-20 07:25:14
There seems to be a lot of positive news recently in mainstream US news. How many days until the surge from that comes in?
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:31:06
Thing is, if no one uses their Bitcoins, this will all be for naught.
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:33:16
How can you put a copy of a wallet on a secondary harddrive?
