Watch some youtube videos on how to manage your own keys. Try a Git hub version of bitaddress.org and safely store your encryption keys in 2 or more places. Don't trust others to hold your money. Trust yourself.

Try bitfinex.

Personally, I think it's better if you generate and manage your own private keys. Like that you can pop up your same private key into different wallet apps/services and have access to your coins, if one goes down, then you have the option to use the other wallet app/service to access your same coins, or you can use both apps/services interchangeably.
Just watch some youtube videos on how to use an offline version of bitaddress.org to generate you keys and store your keys on at least 2 encrypted locations.

That's what HD wallets do. Use new addresses every time.
I prefer the old school method where I manage my own private keys
@_date: 2016-08-31 09:08:45
Mathematically, given enough time. Someone could possibly generate the key to recover them. That is as time approaches infinity.

The private key works for both types. Any new private keys generated will also work for both types.

It's not about the cost of whatever your trying to invest in. It's about the percentage gains. It makes no difference if you buy 10 $1 coins or 1 $10 coin. If it goes up by even 20%. You made the same amount of profit in both cases. Invest if you feel btc will continue to rise.

Manage your own bitcoin private keys. Keep extra private key copies, encrypted and secure elsewhere. Like that if you ever lose your phone or get it stolen. You will still have access to your coins.

Call Chase to confirm the transaction and try again. Chase has some sensitive anti fraud algorithms.

Edit: This may not pertain to you.
The transaction may have gotten stuck along the way. This has happened to me once long ago. If so, your btc are stuck in intermediate shared coin addresses and may be recoverable.
 If you navigate into your block chain account. Go to the shared coin tab and try to find a button that says something like recover intermediate addresses or or something of that nature.
This will check to see if any recent shared coin transactions didn't go through and if yes. Your account will automatically be given access to the intermediate addresses private keys from your synced shared coin account to your block chain account  giving you access once again to your coins.

The world is full of chaos, every unstable event brings more recognition to bitcoin. So in that sense, yes, it is a store of value.

I think their upgraded version requires an email. Or at least to create a new (non legacy) wallet, it does.

Best to manage your own private keys, like that you never have to worry about losing access when using a third party wallet.

A good book I recommend is "Trading in the zone by Mark Douglas" it's also available on audible.com for those that want to download it for free if they never used audible.
That book has reduced by losses by 90% and has made trading stress free.

The bitcoin halving occured this year. Dropping bitcoins generated per block reward from 25 btc / block to 12.5 btc / block. This happens roughly every 4 years. 
The other condition that has helped bitcoin is that it has become more stable as we have had months of consolidation with little to no downward pressure. I think this has helped strengthen people's views that bitcoin could be a safe store of value.
I honestly think bitcoin will break 1k sometime in 2017. I would say to stock up at times of bad news/panic selling and hold.

I do think at times whales will coordinate at critical points to cause a breakout, once they set the trend, the fish will follow.

Safest thing to do is manage your own private keys. Keep most of your funds in deep cold storage and only some funds in your hot wallet. Simple as that. Also keep backups of your hot wallet private key just in case your phone breaks or gets stolen.

Thanks for taking the time to write this response. All worked out, although it does seem like a hassle if you have regular watch addresses to have to re add them.

Oh I see what you mean.
From my observation on reddit. Google knows what apps you've previously installed but any specific app data information is only stored locally and managed by that specific app.
I say this because I've read several times on here how users upgraded a phone, broke a phone and or reinstalled some apps on a phone and lost all their coins with whatever wallet application they were using.
I assume that they assumed that their private keys were being stored on the cloud by either google or that particular app.
And turned out that their assumption was wrong and all data was locally stored.
For example: Mycelium stores private keys locally.

I think if you trust the person and as long as you see the transaction post to the block chain, then it's enough for me.

Investing is about patience.
Bitcoin may fall below 4200 for a year and then double to 8400 in two years. You never know, but if you have patience, you will be profitable.

Free markets are supposed to represent a form of "democracy," it reflects the will of the people, even if it doesn't make sense. We assume that price is a rational representation of supply and demand but we have to remember that the people who decide the price value are not rational thinkers all the time.

You would need to access the block chain account you used for your shared coin transaction. Somewhere within the shared coin section there's a recovery feature. This will give your account the private keys to the intermediate addresses where your coins where last at before the transaction was interrupted. I've only had coins get stuck once using shared coins, I was able to recover them using the above  method.

Trading is not as easy as it sounds. Imagine a large room where  everybody is trading money with each other, with the same goal, to make a profit. In order for someone to make a profit, someone has to lose. When you put real money on the line, it's not a game for amateurs. It's literally a large scale chess game where everyone is trying to fuck everyone over. That is why trading is so complicated. Find a system that works for you, setup rules to follow and stick to it. A good book I recommend is "Trading in the zone by Mark Douglas" also available on audible.

Don't worry about the simple minds. It's their loss.
I always tell people price is irrelevant, it's about the percentage gains. This applies to stocks as well.
I think those people have a short sighted view. They can't envision bitcoin being $5,000/coin or $10,000/coin. They see the current price only relative to its past, so compared to its past, it looks expensive.
I think one proposed idea is that once it breaks $1000/coin. To refer to bitcoins price and units in mBTC.
So instead of a user having only 1 BTC. He can now state he has 1000 mBTC's each worth $1
@_date: 2016-10-30 20:38:27
1 BTC = 1000 mBTC

Heres one possible way. You can have family members generate a pgp key, you hold onto their public pgp keys. Then you create a shared Google doc with them that you can update regularly with your new bitcoin keys as time goes on without bothering your family members. That document contains your bitcoin private keys encrypted in layers. First layer is encrypted by Person A's pgp keu. Second layer is encrypted by Person B's pgp key. Third Layer is person A again and fourth layer is Person B again. Like that if you die, they both have to work together to retrieve your savings and do as you directed them to do and if one of them ever plans to steal your funds while your alive, he will likely have to get the other person to cooperate, so it will be less likely.

Lite coin has activities segwit, this has lead to a speculative increase in lite coin value. I assume if the same happens to bitcoin, the trend may follow.

I think learning how to generate and maintain/secure your own private keys gives you a deeper understanding of how the block chain works. Reading some guides is all it took for me to have my aha moment.

It is possible that bitcoin has now priced in for the halving.
But I expect human behavior to likely act in a predictable pattern and fomo will occur again when the halving is about to occur. 
What I am more interested about is what happens after the halving has occured. I assume several people bought bitcoin just for the halving and will probably start to cash out and take profit before or right after the halving. I assume that's probably what is currently causing the downward pressure already.
@_date: 2016-07-07 18:10:06
My assumption is that there was excessive buying in expectation for the halving and now people are starting to take profit.
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:45:57
As long as there's a greater fool, it can continue to rise infinitely. However, I assume eventually a whale will take profits and cause the little fish to start taking profit / panic selling /shorting.

Your hunch is close. I think the main reasons for the fluctuations in price is liquidity (not enough coins in the order book to buy and sell) and "dumb money" (people new to trading) trading emotionally.

A decade from now, the block reward will be 3.125 with the next halving in 2028 @ 1.5625 btc/block
Approx 95% of all bitcoins would have been mined by this point.
