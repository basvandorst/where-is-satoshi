Just did my first max withdrawal from Coinbase, funds were in my bank account in 3 days.

Ive been waiting for BTC to transfer from Breadwallet to GDAX as I'm looking to sell a small piece of what I have.  That was 6 hours ago when the BTC price was $1,500 more than it is now.  Still waiting....

I didn't know I could change / increase the fee.  I picked the fee that said it would confirm within 10-60 minutes.  I'll have to pay more attention to that next time.  Thanks.

Over a 20% drop and it's still about $350-400 over its true NAV.  Could go below 1100 if it truly corrects

Thanks for posting.  I've been waiting over 3 days for a transfer from Bread to GDAX myself.  Hopefully I'll get my coin back after 8 too

It's a more "traditional" investment option for someone looking for bitcoin exposure without outright buying a bitcoin.  It's a bitcoin investment trust.  Each share represents 0.09196847 BTC.  Therefore the net asset value (NAV) of each share is currently $1,076 based on current BTC price of $11,700.  For some reason (speculation on increase in BTC, fear of missing out, etc) GBTC has been tracking higher than the value of the underlying BTC it represents.  What you are seeing here is simply a correction towards the actual "value" of each GBTC share.
This morning the price of GBTC was around $1,900, meaning it was about $800 "overpriced" compared to the value each share represented.

My first buys took about 9 days to hit my account.  You bought it at the executed price when you submitted your buy, not the price when it "hits" your account.  You bought it at the 8.3k price.

The IRS is treating crypto as property.  Any gain has to be reported. 
You bought crypto for $100 and sold it for $102.  You've got a $2 capital gain to report

The only reason really

In a word, no.  It's not worth the risk.  If the IRS catches you concealing income / revenue, they will make your life a living hell.
