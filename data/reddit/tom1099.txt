If the transaction has non-zero fees you can be almost certain it will be included in blockchain even without any confirmations. 2 confirmations later it's practically impossible to reverse (I'm assuming you're not a target of 51% attack, which didn't ever happen). The confirmations are designed to appear every 10 minutes so 3-5 minutes is rather quick. And those mini-transactions probably won't be included in blockchain, someone is just spamming the network with invalid transactions, he is advertising or does it just because he can.

What about remembering Electrum seed?


Tx fees are spent by miners on electricity. And they are not obligatory (fee of 0 cause tx to wait very long for confirmation though).
I just felt you exaggerated the problem and responded in similar manner ;)

For me it seems that author uses sometimes Bitcoin creator's words and sometimes words of the guy described in the article, so you cannot deny that "Nakamoto said he will be no longer involved in Bitcoin", because he did. On bitcointalk. And you can't also deny that "Nakamoto refused to say anymore", because he did, in person, when "journalist" tried to speak to him!

The chances that the valid transaction with fee is rejected because you tried to double-spend your coins is minimal - the first transaction you make will probably be "caught" by miners sooner, and wallets do not support double-spending so it's more difficult to do this for an average thief :)

If Doge will become more valuable and popular then people will be making less fun of it and tend to talk about it more serious (can you imagine throwing hundreds of $ to doge, because its funny, despite inflation?). But Doge is based on fun so it would end its growth. Doge can be good way to introduce people into crypto but I don't expect it to replace Bitcoin

The US, created as liberal state, was place that became hope for better life, chance to get off poverty, symbol of freedom, state where you could work and get fair reward for your job - e.g. for people of Galicia (northern Austria then, nowadays Poland) in 19th century. You should be more aware how lucky you are to live in place like that, just compare it to Africa or South America. You say you had large guilds in control of everything, so look on Ukraine, for example. And you cry for more government, it should give you everything. You are lucky you can accomplish so much on your own. Government is not only welfare. It has its negative sides. When it gives you everything it means it takes control of you. It means that people in government get more power than the rest of society. So maybe you should go and actually read some thick books.

Bitcurex is an exchange that used good security methods (e.g. blocking edition of withdrawal address) and they quickly reacted. I'm pretty sure the money wasn't stolen;

You are saying you do not have a proof of sending $500k when using Bitcoin?

There should be option to forward funds every t time, to avoid high tx fees when receiving lots of microtransactions. Aside of that - great!

No BTC can be withdrawn from MtGox but those inside the exchange can still flow. And people expect that some money will be able to be withdrawn soon.

10000tps with 1kB/t means that bandwidth required to use full node would be 10000tps*1kB/t*2=10MB/s 
(2 for receiving mined blocks, assuming they would be broadcasted)
It seems to be in not too bad order of magnitude, especially when we are thinking of future

From that article it seems that it's all just about blockchain size, so it can be just being pruned from time to time and that's all. What is the problem?

All Bitcoin txs are stored in public blockchain. You can see them [here]( [here]( or [here](

And? The term "bitcoin" was introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto as a name for digital cash system. Anyone involved in Bitcoin using this word is reffering to it. Apple Inc. has TM for "apple" but they can't sue apple growers or groceries
@_date: 2014-03-05 16:47:21
It depends how much do you want to store and use. If you are going to seriously invest in Bitcoin, use paper wallet (generate it while offline and if you want to be truly secure, to do it just boot your computer up from LiveUSB/CD). If you want only a small portion of BTC - use Electrum (on PC), Andreas Schildbach's wallet (Android) or Blockchain.info (both, has 2FA but you trust your coins to 3rd party). And you can combine those methods by sending some coins from paper wallet to hot wallet from time to time (beware of change). Not too much hassle, not too difficult, still pretty secure. Don't get paranoid (I mean: buying separate machine just for bitcoin guys) and enjoy! 
@_date: 2014-02-18 15:55:04
But there are people who had problems just because their actions were connected to bitcoin. So it is true issue, not paranoic imagination.

AFAIK they are now contacting merchants to set up Bee payments soon. They will be taking some % of the transactions like Coinbase. They are also going to allow people deposit money with them and use them as bitcoin or as €.

bitcoin.de and localbitcoins.com don't have funds in escrow; also you put Bitcoin in exchange for not long, let's say max. one week.
@_date: 2014-03-02 13:32:01
Technically yes, you just put the tx id on one of the pages above and you will see where they were sent. You can use "taint analysis" on blockchain.info to see what adresses received most of your coins. The problem is that your coins after so much time could be spent somewhere and receiver could spend them somewhere else etc., they could finally end in wallet of e.g. exchange where they would mix themselves with tons of other people's coins.

In last year Partia Libertarianska was created. They seem to have nice and good programme, and they don't act stupidly like KNP. Not too popular though. The libertarian is a person who wants economy completely unrestricted (e.g. the lowest possible taxes covering only military and judges). Some of them are anarcho-capitalist (no govt at all, private police), but IMO it's going too far - I can't see it working.

And even if it was Dorian, who answered with those words, you are not provided with the context, what was the actual question?

No warning signs? In late 2013 this sub was spammed with anti-MtGox posts and there was hardly anyone who would call them reliable.


Why did you put money in an exchange where you cannot withdraw money? That's basic functionality of an exchange!


They CAUSED most of those storms...
OK, I understand that you lost money on Mt.Gox, sorry, it shouldn't have happened, I hope you'll get some of your money back. But don't be a dick, saying you weren't warned of risks! This whole sub were doing everything to prevent people from using Gox!

If exchange's software searches the blockchain looking for withdrawal transactions using transaction hash and doesn't see it then it might think it has been someway invalid and show the money as not spent. Miners would then reject all the next transactions that are using that money.

If you make transactions with fee&gt;0 there's no real treat. And even with 0 fee, who would go to the shop, pay for stg 10$, and then run away to revert that transaction? (I don't know if any wallet allows people to do so, so one must be advanced user)

When the fossil fuels ends, people will change to green or nuclear energy. It may be just more expensive for a while, until more efficient technology will be made. Enviroment wil then become cleaner too. In the matter of fresh water - in the UAE there are aquaparks in the desert. I don't really know why people are so pessimistic about future nowadays. IMO science and free market will find a solution, as they always did.
