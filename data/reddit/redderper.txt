Monero is the most anonymous and untraceable cryptocurrency. Even if you know someone's Monero address you can't see their balance and transaction history without the viewkey.

I'm talking about the size of the gap. Banks make trillions because of the current monetary system. The federal reserve is a private party that can create money out of thin air just by swapping some bonds. The euro is perhaps the biggest failure of them all. The value of currency in South America and Africa evaporate. If you don't acknowledge that these are failing systems you are delusional to me and it makes me wonder why you're even here.

Lmao I never said anything about replacing central banks. It's an alternative for currency, stocks and commodities. Right now it works best as a store of value and it works as a currency, but not good enough yet. The real value of bitcoin as a currency lies in the future when lightning network makes it possible to send nearly instant transactions with almost no fees. If that gets implemented it will fix most of the problems you listed and it will most likely be ready in 2018. There are a lot of cryptocurrency that are better and more innovative than bitcoin, but bitcoin is probably going to be the first one to get adopted by the masses. Although I think banks in their current form need to die, they unfortunately won't for a long time. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:20:45
Fuck, messed up the title. Oh well
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:03:23
That I agree with. Although I doubt it would do much if some core spokesperson announced that they're working on it. There are people testing lightning network right now, but nobody will care about it until it actually turns out to be the solution. They can't really dispell the FUD, they can only say that they're working on the problem. I'm tbh just hoping bitcoin will stabilize around the 15-20K mark while the really solid alts gain in value until bitcoin fix the scalability problems they're having.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:18:49
Look, all of your arguments can be summed up as "I don't care about the advantages of cryptocurrency, because I'm okay with banks, governments, using using FIAT as currency and stocks/commodities as a store of value". That is totally fine, but not everyone feels that way. 
I dislike FIAT because I need a creditcard or PayPal to buy anything abroad. If I don't use my FIAT to buy stocks or commodities which is also a hassle it loses value. I hate banks, they are slow, they use your money to speculate, when I go broke I have to pay them and when they go under the account holders have to help them stay up. I also like that cryptocurrency isn't affected by economic instability like stocks and FIAT are. I think Bitcoin isn't that good as a currency, but it's a really good alternative for gold and other cryptocurrency are useful as alternatives for currency or investments. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:36:33
I said "I think". Of course I don't know for sure, nobody does. To me it makes sense what he's saying. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:53:20
That's true, but unlike with FIAT everyone had the exact same chance to buy bitcoin and/or verify transactions in exchange of bitcoin. Getting in early paid off. And yes the governance and mining has become more centralized in the last years, but it's still a very honest, transparent and decentralized system if you compare it to FIAT. Another advantage is that if you have the public and private key of your wallet you'll always have full control over it. When you put your money on the bank it not only inflates, but you also don't have control over it anymore, you only get the promise that the bank will give you the money when you withdraw. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:10:38


No one should be storing any great amount of wealth on an exchange. Exchanges are for trading, not storing. If you have lots of cryptocurrency and you want to store it you should put it in a wallet that you own the private keys of. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:48:15
Well so far bitcoin has proven to not be scalable without a solution like lightning network. Ethereum has scalability problems as well, but it still works way better as a currency than bitcoin. I haven't seen anything indicating that Stellar is not scalable yet.

Holy shit, it's going to take another year of transactions piling up while fees go through the roof? I was quite optimistic about bitcoin because I thought lightning was at most a couple of months away. It makes me wonder why I'm still holding onto a coin that is now only useful as a store of value that likely won't hold its value till they actually fix the problems. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:18:24

Ethereum's market cap being kept down by the huge amount of shit ICO's that raise a ton of ether and dump them on the market. Neo/Gas has a lot less crap ICO's and their blockchain has better scalability due to DBFT instead of POW. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:23:10
Transaction throughput has been dead on Bitcoin for months. Seriously if we don't get lightning network or even a blocksize increase in Q1 2018 it will not be pretty for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:37:32
Ethereum and Stellar can handle a ton more transactions. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:23:00
I don't know who said that, but the price rose waaay to fast. Most of the pump from 5K to 20K was caused by all the hardforks. IMO it would have been a lot better if it grew steady to like $10K instead of being pumped up to $20K, dumped to $15K and noobs panic selling it all the way to $10.8K before bouncing back up. 
The parabolic movement made a ton of people think it's a bubble and rightfully so, because it also showed that bitcoin has some major scalability problems. Most of the people that got in during the last few months got in because they saw hype and a bull market. If this correction didn't happen and it continued going up, the crash after that would probably have been so much worse. 
So the correction was good, it made a lot of the get rich quick people exit the market. Now we can hopefully start again with a much more steady rise. A pump would IMO only be justified if they fix the transaction costs and time, wether they do it with Lightning Network or something else it needs to happen.
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:25:24


Doesn't seem to work "pretty fine" to me if you look at the growing gap between rich and poor.

We have breached 6K like 4x already and everytime bitcoin surged in price shortly afterwards. I personally don't think we'll go below 5K if 6K gets breached.
@_date: 2018-08-17 11:54:22
It's a market psychology thing. In January there was still a ton of optimism in the market, people were saying stuff like "wait for the wallstreet bonuses, then the market will pump", or "wait till Chinese new year is over". This was an indicator that we still had a long way to go. Every now and then that optimism causes some pumps, which will create FOMO and then people will get in again, but after that you'll usually see lower lows.
When people are very pessimistic and ready to give up it's a way better opportunity to get in, because whales have been waiting and saving up for those 75-95% drops to buy back in.

Nah not really, some people are just very easily carried away. If we go +20% in a couple of days this week everyone will start announcing a bull market, if we go - 20% everyone will declare bitcoin dead. It's mostly noobs who react like that anyway. Though no one was entirely sure where it was going, same thing now.

I look at the level of desperation of the posts on crypto subs, which is usually a good indicator of how the market is doing.
@_date: 2018-08-16 17:15:00
I was half joking, but it does hold some truth. Take this thread for example:  This was 2 days ago when every alt went down 20% or more. There are two kinds of posts you see on days like that:
1. Anger or capitulation: mostly pessimistic talk about how they were so stupid to invest in this coin and that it's going to zero. Sometimes people will call it a shitcoin or even claim that they got scammed by the team.
2. Delusional optimism: posts like "this is the opportunity of our lifetimes, buy now or regret later! It's never gonna be as cheap as this again, buy the dip!! ".
Nr 1 is usually an indicator that price is bottoming out, or at least close to the bottom. When you see a lot of posts like nr 2 it's time to sell.

That would kinda defeat the purpose of bitcoin, or rather one of its purposes. Bitcoin is meant to hold its value while fiat is subjected to inflation. If the price of bitcoin stays the same in USD, you would have the same inflation problem. So ideally bitcoin should rise in price as inflation goes up.

EMP's are only temporary. It's not like your crypto is gone when you can't get access to electricity or the internet for some time. Also the system is pretty flexible and barely needs anything to function. Pretty much all you need is at least three different nodes to achieve consensus, anyone in the world can run these nodes.

I see your point, but you can always use a VPN, proxy or TOR. The Chinese can't trust their internet either, but it hasn't stopped them from using crypto. Governments can try to take control of the Internet, but users will always adapt and overcome. I also think that a decentralized Internet protocol would be one of the best use cases for blockchain.

Satoshi is not going to pull anything out of his wallet anytime soon, because it would instantly be known who he is (if he's even alive). I also doubt Satoshi would hate bitcoin cash since it's his idea, it's just that he didn't execute the idea himself and it's open source so he probably expected people to create their own version at some point.

Most of them were taken taken over by governments who created that same Monopoly money out of thin air by swapping some bonds against an extremely favorable interest rate. Some barely survived the bankruptcy, but a lot of banks had to bail out. In the genesis block of bitcoin there's a news article about one of them. I know it seems unbelievable, but shit like that really happened and it's one of the big reasons why bitcoin and other crypto got so popular.
@_date: 2018-07-09 16:49:05
Like I said, that's mostly because bitcoin only handles simple payments and got a headstart of 3 years on Ethereum. Imagine when Dapps like Augur, Request, Chainlink, BAT, Modum and OmiseGo deliver their finished products. Or when Decentralized Exchanges become the norm. Dapps don't have many users today, because the good ones aren't finished yet.
@_date: 2018-07-22 16:41:03
ATM's and exchanges aren't necessary for using crypto though, while a bank is necessary for using fiat. It's just that these things make it more convenient, so people will put up with these third parties anyway (as long as there are no decent decentralized exchanges available). But you do get freedom of choice.

The US housing market is not a great comparison. It got destroyed because of interest rates being near 0 which caused the financial industry to go apeshit on investments since they could get loans extremely easy. Then they created a derivative of mortgages which was considered profitable yet very stable by credit rating firms. At some point they started providing mortgages to whoever the fuck walked into the bank, whether you had a decent income or not, because the banks had more than enough money anyway. The people without decent income started defaulting of course and the mortgage derivatives turned out to be complete horseshit. And then everything collapsed.

Fiat in bank accounts are not though, at least not in the EU. Digital fiat is essentially monopoly money which is only backed by commercial banks, not any governmental body. If your bank files for bankruptcy you essentially have to rely on tax payer money to cover up the losses up till €100K, anything beyond that isn't backed at all.
@_date: 2018-07-08 19:52:49
This survey was also specifically about which cryptocurrency will get most adoption for payments. The main use cases for Ethereum are Dapps, DAO's and ICO's, not payments. If the use cases of Ethereum become more popular than the use case of payments/store of value then Ethereum or a similar platform will become the norm. So it's definitely not a done deal.
@_date: 2018-07-22 12:34:37

You could say the same thing about using bitcoin or other crypto as a currency, not many people use it like that right now. Doesn't necessarily mean that nobody needs bitcoin, all it means is that adoption is low and the technology in its infancy.
