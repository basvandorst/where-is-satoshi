I'd be curious to know the setup of the satellite: how much energy is generated by the solar panels, how much energy storage there is and what's doing the computations that can also be used to mine bitcoin.
I've looked a lot into cubesats and the form factor and weight limitations are quite big that you usually don't end up having spare resources. 
And as mentioned: there's also the whole thing about heat dissipation which is a lot tougher without air.

Where is the incentive to implement the optimisations if you have a block size increase at the same time? 
Look at Coinbase's initial answer to Segwit: "not a priority"...

The DAA for Bcash (the only original bit of code they did write), the S2x debacle...
Edit: but I was referring to the general process of thorough tests before deploying anything that the community around the Bitcoin Core software has; not comparing it to any "competitor".

I miss using Bitcoin on a day to day basis as well; but the question is about how to re-instate that for the long run, not how to quick fix it and hope for the best. 
The fact that the LN release takes time is reassuring, even if it is frustrating, in that it means it is thoroughly tested. I'd rather hold on a few more weeks, months even, than to cross my fingers hoping that untested code doesn't produce side-effects...

That and the fact that actors like SatoshiDice being priced out to other solutions, sidechains or other coins, is a good indicator of the fee market working.
We can also see a lot of big actors (exchanges) who start optimizing their blockchain usage, be it with Segwit and / or batched transactions.
Optimizing everything now that the tech and adoption are still small is certainly smarter and more forward thinking than making more room which would be swooped by such actors and not provide meaningful improvement over the long term...

Schnorr signatures once thoroughly tested and implemented will allow for dust consolidation with minimum blockchain space requirement. I'm actually looking forward to that more than LN...

Sure: Google has almost no money left because nobody clicks on ads anymore. 
And everyone on the world who has computer skills is a also a bitcoin expert.

Or they knew we'd know and It's really an attack pro Gavin and increased block size!
Infinite loop ahead.
