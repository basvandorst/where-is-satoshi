I worked in Technical Support for Toshiba for about 2-3 years: Raising your voice does get what you want. Not all the time. But 90% of the time.

Did you just link to stackoverflow which links back to reddit, and the answer isn't even in this recursive hell?

Stated goals:


* Perform and document repeatable, deterministic builds of TC 7.1a from source code for current major operating systems:
 * Windows 7
 * Mac OS X (Lion 10.7 and Mountain Lion 10.8)
 * Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and 13.04, RedHat 6.4, CentOS 6.4, Debian 7.1, Fedora 19
* Conduct a public cryptanalysis and security audit of the TC 7.1a
Looks like the Windows audit is only part.

...that's not quite how it works. I've actually written something like this to bypass captchas and it normally works something like this:
* Get the Captcha image. Normally by screen-shotting a certain location on the desktop.
* Submit the captcha image along with your account details to de-captcha service by a normal function.
* Within 10 seconds, the function should return the text in the image.
* Insert text and away you go.
Depending on the service you use you can get different response times and prices. The cost is so low (Around 1.3 cents USD) per captcha broken that it's still viable.
Edit - My decaptcha programming was done when Microsoft offered some kind of points for playing games. I wasn't spamming people, in case anyone cared. Which obviously someone does.

Out of [327 listings]( in Elizabeth Bay, there are only 8 that are equal to or more than $1450 a week. You rented an apartment that is more expensive than 97.55% of the properties for rent in that area. I wouldn't say that's exactly a fair representation of 'average'.


I'm not sure where you were buying coke from, but my local 'milk bar' sells cans for $1.20 and 1.5L bottles for $3.70. Some petrol stations will try and gouge you as high as $2 - $2.50 for a can, but the only way you're paying that much is if you are literally going to one of the most expensive stores for Coca Cola in Sydney.

Niet. This is confirmation bias at its finest - "SA" (Not that it's any one person or idea) has threads that mock   hundreds and hundreds of other things.

If you're consuming any unknown substance without re-agent testing them beforehand then this is nothing more than (un?)natural selection.

Odd that the word bitcoin occurs zero times on the page. In fact, neither "bit" nor "coin" appear even as word fragments.

This is more of a 'straw that broke the camels back' situation.This is certainly less circle-jerky than a few that jump to mind (Indian Tea farmers and their 'quotes' and that 80 year old man post the other day, nearly every opinion from redditors about why event y doesn't mean anything for Bitcoin because they personally believe in it, etc) so please don't feel like I'm singling you out.

No idea why there isn't, but just like anything else that benefits businesses it would be political suicide to try and implement it now.
[Here]( is the info on NZ Tax rates, but also have a look at the note [on personal property]( 
Basically, you can avoid all taxes when it comes to the sale of real estate only. 
Edit - Whoops. personal tax rates are [here]( I have no idea what profit from BTC would come under.

If the pool is a registered business, then it's the business's liability. Not his personal liability. The fact that he is paying out of his own personal funds to cover the loss is more than you'd see the CEO of any large company do if they went under.

As someone who lives in Sydney, Australia, 3k/mo is fucking expensive.

We've been using EC2 at work for about a year, and here are a list of issues that I can recall off the top of my head:
* DNS intermittently dying.
* EC2 instances going from "Running" to "Pending" without rhyme or reason.
* ELB's that randomly do not pass connections through listeners.
* EC2 instances running on degraded hardware being rebooted/lost.
While I agree with your mountain of salt statement, it's definitely possible that they've had issues with Amazon.

* A: Bitcoin is anonymous. 
This is a primary feature of the currency. Without this feature, it would not be anywhere near as attractive. In a world where your daily activities are being monitored so closely including traditional financing this is critical.
This will never happen.

Circle Jerk reaching critical mass. Aborting subreddit.
Edit - Op's straw is a very small one, but it broke the camels back. This is definitely not the worst post we've seen, I'm sure most will agree.

Not a business account. Businesses need to regularly pay out large sums. The accountant at my work uses a physical keyfob for 2 factor, which would probably be susceptible to the same attack.
