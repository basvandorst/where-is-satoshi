That's true there are a lot of ponzi schemes. We usually direct toward know portals like Local Bitcoins. We also recommend that they choose a peer with 100% reputation to purchase bitcoin from so they are subject to less risk while they do the transaction. [
@_date: 2019-11-08 16:45:34
why not? really what difference does it make?
@_date: 2019-11-06 14:00:22
No cash transaction are sought after. You only not allowed to open a trading desk in bitcoin but u can even accept it in you business no law against that

@_date: 2018-06-27 16:36:47

there are reports from 2014 that his P2P account was hacked. 
I guess there needs to be a key signature to verify.

If you're trading on an exchange with no Multi-Sig or if you are using a wallet service like [blockchain.info]( that wallet, for instance, would hold your private keys and email access is kind of enough to hack the account (without 2FA) - if you want to understand crypto news subscribe to [cryptotickerr.com]( .

They need education and tutorials on the ground on how to use it, how to store it. 
@_date: 2019-01-20 21:55:33
can i add that a combination of a Yubikey and a password manager like Last Pass can really ramp up your security.
@_date: 2018-04-24 23:02:57

@_date: 2018-04-24 23:21:02
its intresting how he called bitcoin cash the OGs and the more adoption you have the closer you steer to mass habits, the further you go from ideals 
@_date: 2018-04-21 11:15:27
