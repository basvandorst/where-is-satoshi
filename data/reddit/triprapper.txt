This is not a crash, being down 5 percent is nothing for Bitcoin. Too many noobs don't know how the game is played...
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:18:13
Coinbase is back now! BTC is back over $543...we stable again...to all those that panic sold around $460...lmao!
@_date: 2016-04-20 18:37:04
OMG krakken and Circle are better than Coinbase? Really? I would spread my coins to all 3. Any one do then could go offline at a moments notice...
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:20:20
Those coins are already in the move right? Are the not being tumbled right now?

You got $5k bounty in Bitcoin. You are getting greedy because they did not give you more money? Come on bro you need to chill. They probably locked your account because they fealt you were going to extort the company. You did not work your magic right. You need to get some negotiation skills bro.
But hey thanks for finding these exploits. They know and you know there are other exploits and that is probably why they banned or locked your account. You scared the shit out of them...
@_date: 2015-12-12 20:40:02
That's almost $2 million dollars worth of Bitcoin. I know of no Bitcoin lotteries out there paying that much. 
Post the transaction ID if you are legit...
@_date: 2015-12-12 20:44:07
Looks like it is working. You are using your btc balance on coinbase to buy anything you want. You still can't buy anything you want in the world with Bitcoin but now your can.
Why all the hate on the coinbase visa debit card? It works and it just one of many tools in the cypto world we live in.
@_date: 2015-12-12 05:06:02
$2500 by end of 2017!!!
@_date: 2015-12-20 14:46:01
First of all you were too slow. People where able to get their shit out last Monday because a lot of the admins came on line and were able to help people. But since you were too slow...you coins are probably gone...
@_date: 2015-12-12 20:41:17
Cryptsy is still running you just can't withdraw reliably with BTC but you can with other coins...
@_date: 2015-12-11 04:27:27
Trade btc to Eth or LTC and withdraw. Come on people you know this about cryptsy! Why are y'all still biotching?
They got issues but it way easy to work around them...also don't store coins on there or any exchange!
@_date: 2014-11-27 05:09:36
If Bitcoin is illegal then why is the US Marshals selling or sold the Bitcoin they captured?
Explain that shit? 
@_date: 2014-04-11 11:04:47

This is what you get when you pre order. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 01:32:01
Down 10 percent is not crashing...we will be back up to $1200 by Christmas...
@_date: 2014-02-12 02:21:27
But all the other exchanges have come back online and working. GOX is still not allowing withdrawals. So GOX is still screwed. But they might recover if they did not lose anybody's funds.
@_date: 2014-06-07 22:12:15
The best mobile OS? Yeah right. Is Microsoft had the best mobile is they would have the most apps and be making the most money in they App Store. 
@_date: 2014-02-10 17:27:01
Man they are moving quick! Good riddance to mt GOX!
@_date: 2014-03-27 22:09:40
We holding good above $500! Summertime is going to be good for bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-06-01 13:42:23
SpaceX dragon v2 is awesome. It's time corporations do some out of this world advanced space designs instead of nasa even though all the stuff nasa build was by tech corporations...so be heh the dragon V2 is awesome! 
You know the space shuttle was designed back in the early 70's it was time for it to be retired..
@_date: 2014-06-12 21:07:38
As long as I have 1000 bitcoins...I will be one of those super rich guys then. Lmao!
@_date: 2014-02-24 05:43:16
It's possible they got hacked. Mt GOX ain't going down yet. I still think they might survive somehow...hopefully we will find out in the next few days. 
Sucks for the peeps who have stuff stuck up in there. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 04:47:47
Wow...pretty good...it needs a little bit of work at the end but it's funny overall. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:46:10
It's doing pretty good...sitting around $535 avg at 1:45 pm central time. Hopefully it is only up from here...
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:35:29
First of all why would GOX still allow trading for weeks if they knew they scammed 740k BTC already from their users? Oh wait....
This is definitely an inside job...
@_date: 2014-04-15 00:33:03
Once rich folks realize this they will pump a lot more money into bitcoin and the price will skyrocket. We just need stable and safe exchange and wallets.
Any coin or tech tied to bitcoin will go along for the ride...
@_date: 2014-03-01 13:00:16
Wow damn! BFL gone? There are going to be a lot of pissed off people who lost their money in the monarch preorders..
BFL come on now, you know you have their BTC. Give it back. I know pay pal fuck you over with all this refunds last year but why you got to steal people BTC?
Just give it back if you going belly up...
@_date: 2014-03-28 03:12:11
BTC already back over $520...a nice comeback!
@_date: 2014-02-08 15:08:24
Wow the GOX says they have a problem and they say they are going to fix it and people don't believe them. Give them time, they might be able to fix their problem. There have been other exchanges that have gone offline and come back....cryptsy.....coinex (offline for a week) and they are still alive...sure you can't buy BTC directly with cash from these exchanges or withdraw to usd but they came back. 
Mt GOX will be back and be better. Mark Cuban ain't gonna buy shit. He already got too much on his plate. He needs to get his Dallas mavericks to the playoffs! Lol!
Mt GOX needs to survive. The winkle twins should buy that exchange. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 01:47:48
We don't need china. They will be stuck in their black hole and will realize they were wrong when it's too late.
@_date: 2014-11-26 00:14:03
Gaw and paycoin is going to be bigger than big. If you did not get in to mining the hashpoints is all your lost. All the cloud mining systems are about the same...GaW is just the biggest...so they are the biggest target. 
Only invest what you can stand to lose.
@_date: 2014-02-11 00:22:22
Agreed! Hopefully GOX does not survive this. Blaming the bitcoin protocol was a bad move. A desperate bad move. Hopefully the people who have BTC and cash on the GOX get their stuff back.
@_date: 2014-02-15 16:02:07
Mt GOX is like a cat with 9 lives, they are going to survive this somehow. Crazy I know but they will. But people withdraw your GOX BTC when you are able to. Just to be safe!
@_date: 2014-02-10 11:46:40
Whatever...mt GOX is done after this crisis is solved.
@_date: 2014-03-22 15:38:21
It's don't matter everybody will be lining up and camping out to get the iPhone 6. Apple don't need bitcoin. Wallets need to be htlm5. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 15:58:21
It's not that bad...cheap coins. Wall Street is going to come in s buy up all the bitcoins at $100-$200...then pump it to $1000..just get in within that range...
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:30:46
Maybe google or Facebook could buy mt GOX...FB paid $19 billion in cash/stock for whatsup...lol!
@_date: 2014-08-13 16:50:38
This guy is pissed because bitcoin price is down today and he wants it to be up past $1000. He is blaming altcoins for bitcoins price drop...but we all know altcoins are down harder than even bitcoin prices.
He needs to calm down. Bitcoin and altcoins are beyond wallstreet. Once wallstreet gets into crypto coins, things are going to get interesting!

Wait cryptsy is dead? What happened? I thought cryptsy was the best exchange...but remember folks never hold coins in any exchange. Use exchanges to buy and sell coins.

Damn I am going to buy some Bitcoin like right now! 10 years from now I know I am going to be a multimillionaire! 😁

You got ripped off. 2.17 BTC? Wow!
@_date: 2014-06-30 20:04:05
Whoever won this bid is not going to be selling these bitcoins, they are whales and are going to hold onto them and try to manipulate the markets. 30000 bitcoins is a very large investment...they will sell some when it hits $5000 a coin...
@_date: 2014-03-30 14:52:43
Cryptsy is still the best us Altcoin trading exchange. They have the most volume. They are not belly up like coinex and cryptorush! 
Also you have to be verified to access the USD trading portions on cryptsy. This process will start in the next week.
@_date: 2014-11-26 00:10:00
Just a bunch of haters being paid from all the other companies that hate GaW!

There is no way to fix this....

Who would have thought the Dollar kicking everybody ass...all other fiat currencies and cryptos and gold and silver.
Everybody was saying the dollar was going to get replaced by Bitcoin or the BRICs upcoming currency...not going to happen anytime soon...
Russia and China are about to collapse under the almighty dollar...
People thought gold and silver was gonna save them. Yeah right. You can't put all your eggs in one basket!😞
But Bitcoin will survive because it's starting to being manipulated by wall street so just get ready for a crazy ass ride. It's gonna hurt but it's gonna feel oh so good in the end! 😜

Fuck china! We will get over this only after china officially bans bitcoin...lol!
@_date: 2014-04-06 14:02:37
The rubble as the reserve currency? That is not the best currency out there right now. There are much better ones. Any of the countries that hate bitcoin you don't want them to control the world economy....ie china and Russia. At least the EU and USA are bitcoin/cryptocurrency friendly. 
Once the USA figures out how to export all of it's abundant natural gas it's all over for Russia.

Amazon has lots to lose eventually by not accepting bitcoin but apple has nothing to lose...they will eventually. Bitcoin is not mainstream yet. Apple never does anything until they deem it mainstream...2015 will be the year to change all of that.

The only miners to buy are the bitmain antminer s3 which hash around 500 gh/s for about .72 BTC each and they use about 300-400 watts of power. 
4 of these would be about 2 th/s for a total price of $1800 and 1200 watts of power usage. It's 28 nm.

So far they have not killed bitcoin. All the other exchanges are holding above $600 usd per bitcoin. Mt GOX will die probably this week and all will more forward. BTC will resume it's journey towards $1200.

@_date: 2014-10-04 17:07:56
We will still see $1000 a coin soon...it's just going to take more time. Bitcoin is almost mainstream! The low price just hurts mining....It's dipping down to attract new investors! Get in while it's still low! Your going to hate yourself 10 years from now...
There is not way gold and silver are going to double or triple in price like Bitcoin will in the next year or so.
Bitcoin for the long term!!!

Bill gates is a loser but a rich loser. The richest loser. He may have missed all the good boats but his Microsoft boat made him. 
It would be nice if he came out and supported bitcoin. But when you already got 69 billion dollars bitcoin don't really matter to you.
@_date: 2014-10-05 16:00:28
I am holding onto my 4ish bitcoins and still mining...we will get through this...$1000 here we come!!!

Yeah but they still better than Microsoft.
And apple is coming around to crypto currencies. 
@_date: 2014-10-29 20:34:56
But is it secure?
@_date: 2014-03-08 14:25:48
Hang in there! Once you roll up in a Lamborghini hurrican whip bought with BTC they will get it. Who cares if they think it was luck. All that matters is that you are happy. Bitcoin or some type of crypto currency/commodity will be the thing 10 years from now. We are still in the beginning...
I remember when I bought 250 shares of amazon stock back in 1999 or so...people thought I was stupid....

@_date: 2014-02-15 16:15:41
Coinbase will get into the game. They have too or somebody else will beat them too it.
@_date: 2014-02-06 23:20:38
I don't understand it, everybody who uses an iPhone and uses bitcoin already has the blockchain app installed in their iPhone, so you are not losing anything by apple banning the app. It's perminately in your collection after you sync with iTunes. Sure apple sucks but an iPhone is worth money. You just sell it and use that money to get a nexus 5 or some other google phone. 
The upcoming HTLM5 bitcoin wallet webapps will make up for not having a native iOS app. 
@_date: 2014-11-29 12:46:46
Once apple embraces Bitcoin and allows the IOS Bitcoin wallets to use apple pay and Touch ID its on! This will happen in iOS 9.0 in 2015.
Using your Bitcoin wallet will be like using a credit card in Apple pay.

@_date: 2014-09-06 21:23:52
What if apple also allows the bitcoin apps to get in on this tech too? Y'all just have to wait and see what happens on Tuesday. This could be epic! Google will follow in the coming months.

Russian with its BRICs is trying to kill the federal reserve and they are not having great success with that...so how will bitcoin kill the fed reserve? There will always be a fed reserve monopoly as long as there is a global economy. Bitcoin will be an alternate currency or storage of wealth. Bitcoin would have to be accepted in all countries first before it has a chance of killing anything...
@_date: 2014-07-04 15:35:14
Russia bans bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-07-01 11:39:15
If bitcoin goes to $1000 in the next two months, the s3 will be worth it. Plus the s3 will probably drop to less than $200 each in the next two months too...so double up and get better ROI. Sucks...mining sucks...but it is so much fun!
@_date: 2014-11-17 12:04:12
Whatever the dollar is at the all time high in the past 6 years and the Russian currency is down into the dumps. The dollar is going to retain the reserve currency status. They are not going to use Bitcoin for that at least not yet. Bitcoin is not mainstream yet. We still got a long ways to go. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 02:06:29
More like 2 months time...we just got to get over this hump. Even GOX is going to survive this. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 12:01:51
The miners are never going to stop mining...but this will or might level out the difficulty which is a good thing. It's now more profitable to mine script coins over bitcoins. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 00:30:35
Congrats! Now get it up to 10 BTC!!! Hehe!
@_date: 2014-07-26 13:23:43
They have been saying the dollar was going to crash for decades. It's still around and probably will always be around. The world is too big to base the main currency on the gold standard. China has always been hoarding gold. Fort Knox has gold in it, maybe not as much as china but there be gold up in there. Conspiracy theories are just that theories....
Bitcoin to a trillion dollar market cap a very good possibility as long as china gets on board...remember china and Russia still hate bitcoin....oh and New York does too lol!
@_date: 2014-02-07 17:27:29
Anybody selling apple shares right now is making a mistake! You never trade on the markets with emotion. You trade to make money. Apple is positioned to release several new products this year. And any one of them will be a trend setter.
If you are a serious trader you would own google, apple and even some Microsoft. You never sell all your position, just part if it. What if apple jumps up to $1200 a share like google? 
@_date: 2014-09-06 21:19:38

Bitcoin is on a downward spiral I hope it bounces back and soon. 2015 is not looking good. You guys are too sidetracked on all the crap that is not remotely related to Bitcoin.

@_date: 2016-03-05 18:01:15
Yeah it's still near $400...this is not anywhere near a crash...down to $300 is a crash...
@_date: 2015-01-04 13:40:19
Once people calm down...up to $1000 we go!
@_date: 2015-01-03 16:25:48
Bitcoin trying to hold $300 if it don't it's a downward spiral. Get off of paycoin and lets get Bitcoin back on track!

It is still early in the bitcoin world give it some time. Even mt GOX is going to survive this.

Fuck it! We don't need or want an ETF! BTC can go with it on its own!

Coinbase still kinda jacked, maybe it works in the web browser on a PC but the mobile app is DOA!
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:19:43
Yeah coinbase is a complete fail in these situations bro!
@_date: 2017-03-11 01:03:24
They still rich, hopefully they sold their bitcoin earlier today before the big drop and bought back in when it was $1050
@_date: 2017-03-18 23:51:23
Let fork and get it over with! This is not high school this is real life! Some people got their life savings tied up in bitcoin...

Peerplays tokens are not even trading yet...no way coinbase is dealing in peerplays...
But maybe this is a sign that they will...��
@_date: 2016-06-03 23:19:14
Oh wait you sent the btc to the wrong addy! You sent the btc to buy peerplays...looks like by the receipt you are able to log into the peerplays account so you have to now create a bitshares account to have the peerplays tokens transferred to your bitshares account...unless somebody scammed you and they stole your btc...verify your btc addy on coinbase...
@_date: 2017-01-30 01:54:21
Yep I am on the buying mode too! It will spike again in the future! Bitcoin is bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-01-07 03:43:37
Come on people bitcoin goes up and down $200 all the time! Things can't always go up all the time! It has to come down to shake out weak hands and to gather up scragglers who missed the ��!
@_date: 2017-01-07 03:45:55
Congrats! Hold on to it! Don't panic and don't sell! Weak hands always lose!

@_date: 2017-01-17 15:11:30
It's instant bros if you got coinbase setup right and your verified up to a certain amount but if your going for really big purchases you have to use other platforms. 
@_date: 2017-01-12 05:14:27
Yep! China ain't ever gonna ban bitcoin! I don't get why people don't understand this.

@_date: 2016-12-25 14:34:42
Come on people you don't leave 6 figure values of bitcoin in coinbase or any exchange. The 12 word paraphrase is like a password there are many good smartphone password apps so that you can store the paraphrase in there and have the app finger print protected or store it in a hardware wallet inside of a fire proof safe in your house. Keep a small amount of bitcoin on coinbase but spread out the rest of your massive bitcoins on to multiple wallets like hardware, paper and smartphone wallets!
@_date: 2016-12-03 16:01:46
Yeah people just don't realize this...
@_date: 2016-12-25 14:20:35
This is the smart way to play in bitcoin.

The the only exchange is the freedom ledger type. Even the bitcoin network can get hacked and you lose access to all your bitcoin. It has not happened but you never know what the future holds. Some say the internet can never go down completely if it did none of these crypto currencies would work.
@_date: 2016-12-26 22:44:17
I think BTC-E has been hacked just not completely wiped out like bifinex, Mt Gox, cryptsy, etc...

BCH is and was a scam to get free money. It’s not an attack it’s a way to make some people rich!

Maybe Trevon and buying back his lost bitcoins! Lmao!
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:02:12
Just think if BCH and BTG did fork out of BTC we would be at $25k already!

It is not the USA it's NY!!!
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:04:24
Whoever pump and dumped BCH made a killing! Almost $20 billion dollars traded in BCH over the last 4 days! Now BTC is back! I wish I had the BOT they were using! ��
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:59:37
It’s called a breakout and we breaking out to $10k and then pull back to $9k then breakout to $25k! 
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:02:28
21 million total bitcoins x $1 million = $21,000,000,000,000! Definitely doable maybe within 10 years!

$5000 here we come!
@_date: 2016-10-28 02:46:49
Sounds like we got some bitter folks. Come on now zcash is not going to replace bitcoin but it is going to run up nicely and it's the hot coin right now. Get in early and mine the crap out of it! You will hate yourself if your don't at least try. Zcash futures are already trading over $260 per zcash!
@_date: 2015-11-26 17:33:06

Yeah Bitcoin is in the front page of foxnews. This is totally awesome! Maybe that is why the price is going up now.
@_date: 2015-11-28 04:32:45
Anybody spending $9k on miners right now is waisting their money. Just buy the Bitcoin and hope the price rises. Much safer way to invest. Buy Bitcoin and Etherium.
@_date: 2017-05-13 02:26:49
Too many weak hands out there..I say $1500 is the new bottom!

It's all about the money and control...it always has been...some of you are just realizing it now...
@_date: 2015-10-25 15:53:15
All you got to do is withdraw below your limits...come on people it is not that hard. If you money is locked up in cryptsy then you are doing it all wrong...
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:33:00
You can't retire investing in bitcoin unless you go $100k and dumping it into bitcoin. You gonna make millions if you pick the right alt coin and it pops 1000 percent. The days of getting rich off of bitcoin are way past but if bitcoin goes to $1 million in a few years then all bets are off...LOL!
@_date: 2015-11-09 14:05:44
Add solar to the house and you will probably have free electricity...
@_date: 2015-10-21 13:51:33
Poloniex is the best exchange right now but I think cryptsy will survive this. They will never be the same but so many people hate cryptsy over the years and they are still around...just don't leave a lot of coins on there...trade for free and get out. That is what exchanges are for!
@_date: 2016-10-31 01:49:33
Yeah if trump wins the stock markets will crash so yeah BTC will go through the moon...but we will still be broke since we still got to buy stuff based on fiat....
@_date: 2015-10-25 15:55:39
What you should have done was convert your btc to LTC and withdraw that way...
Worked for me...but that was weeks ago..maybe it's worse now.

Wait BTC might be an AI? Wow this could be a good scifi novel!
@_date: 2015-11-22 17:04:00
How can one server bring the whole fucking exchange down? Wtf?!?
@_date: 2015-11-26 03:21:24
It came back, people were able to trade and withdraw if you know what the limits are.
Also don't leave a lot of coins in any exchanges.
@_date: 2015-03-01 14:32:07
@_date: 2015-10-21 13:45:45
Cryptsy is still a good exchange for trades for coins like SPRTS...the volume on cryptsy is still good. You just don't leave a lot of BTC on there or you withdraw in smaller amounts or trade to other coins and withdraw.
Also you get verified.
The rule is to never leave 21 btc on any exchange...not even on one wallet...
@_date: 2016-07-10 01:46:36
Coinbase works perfect unless you are doing something wrong then your account will get flagged and you will have problems. Just use coinbase to buy and sell bitcoins and use other wallets to hold your coins. It's simple as that! Also done left coins in an exchange either.
@_date: 2016-07-04 13:44:05
Plus Trump does not believe in crypto currencies and wants to kill or renegotiate all trade deals so that in itself will bring lots of instability which is what Bitcoin likes. As long as America don't try to ban Bitcoin and cryptos....we should be ok. 2017 might be a chaotic year...we got to get through the weekend first....
@_date: 2016-07-31 15:18:12
Coinbase has nothing to do with ETC, it's ETH....
@_date: 2016-07-08 14:11:01
The $100 Bitcoin days are long gone...sounds like some people are still pissed they missed out on those sub $100 days....I remember when Eth was less than $1....
