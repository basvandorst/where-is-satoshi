or we could just not have this huge debate and use altcoins for transactions that require more speed

me to like when you mine it does it produce new shares? I can see why they might not want that. If not what is the incentive to mine?

I was speculating that this kinda thing could happen a few weeks ago on reddit. Now how to do I make money off this correct prediction?:P I got some extensive replies but most were pretty much people wearing happy glasses. Like everyone was saying how it was for sure a decentralized process that a few major players could not centrally control. Well anyways I feel like this should = I get money... but alas, ranting will have to suffice

what secures the network if its a crypto then? otherwise its just a centralized digital asset IMO

seems all the other classics are getting buy supported naturally. Check out MZC for example. Seems every coin but paycoin is doing what they promised:P

To me this seems centralized. It seems like a cryptographic giftcard or counterparty stock. Whicj are great ideas but call it what it is! I think saying its a currency is misleading. Most, if not all, crypto is made by someone to be used by other ppl and still hold value if the creating company folds or moves on to "other projects." .... damn I would buy in but still recovering my losses from myspace-coin

so if bitcoin forks do I now have "twice as much" like however much bitcoin I have now I will have on the XT fork and also on the original fork that I can spend separately?

I found this fits in twitter and captures my opinion: there are many ways to improve  but honest devs don't hijack satoshi's project. they make their OWN
