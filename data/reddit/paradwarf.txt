That's announcement is 3 days old? Isn't Bip 148 UASF? Seems like FUD to me TBH... please elaborate bud 
@_date: 2017-08-06 20:16:35
id do it. 2k is nothing
@_date: 2017-08-10 05:31:09
lol. its a powergrab. 
3 weeks ago we had consensus?
@_date: 2017-08-17 14:24:52
haha. +1 vote
@_date: 2017-08-10 22:27:46
But look how hostile your comment is.
I'm in the middle, but I think you should be able to have rational discussion about it.
The fact that a post like this gets downvoted is really telling. It's like the Donald subreddit but for bitcoin
@_date: 2017-08-10 21:59:19
Here's a good comment I found.
 
I would love to see this discussed.
This is exactly how I feel as a frequent lurker/user of this subreddit and it is off putting.
"I've been on both subs for quite some time. Probably more often on r/bitcoin, but I go to both subs regularly. The anti-2x zealotry on r/bitcoin is crossing the line from ridiculous to unbearable. As soon as Segwit locked in, the barrage of anti-2x, anti-NYA posts started, and anyone posting to either support 2x or to question any Core developer's statement gets attacked by their down-vote brigade. Luke Jr stated "very few people ever agreed to Segwit2x". I pointed out that statement was false, and they are down-voting me by brigade even as I write this now. If you have to passively agree with everything he says, however false, r/bitcoin is no longer a place where people can have any rational dialogue. Both subs have their issues. Both subs have some users who seem unwilling to take a step back and look at something from another perspective, or engage in a rational discussion, but since Segwit locked in, r/bitcoin has gotten much worse"
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:29:16
good idea.
@_date: 2017-08-08 16:38:50
Now I actually regret dumping by BCH.
I hope we get 2X
Thought we had consensus?
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:28:52
this guy ruined twitter. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:01:48
whats your predictions?
@_date: 2017-05-26 15:28:08
depends. if you do proper ID checks it's okay. i've made some successful purchases using paypal now.
@_date: 2017-05-30 18:31:13
@_date: 2017-05-30 00:35:06
Are you sure? It made it sound like that the recipient was sketchy and like Under investigation or something haha. It was just weird I felt uncomfortable 
@_date: 2017-07-20 19:55:48
I know most of you guys are pro drugs, but these websites have a huge affect on kids and young adults. I live in a small city 130k, and there's been numerous deaths 8-10 due to overdoses from drugs that are acquired via the darknet using cryptocurrency.  Now that Marijuana is on track to evnetually become legal in most states I don't see the need for these websites that sell other drugs, a lot of the times you have highschooler's and college kids obtaining these drugs and end up OD'ing on them. You might know how to use them well, but these kids don't. These sites make it easy to obtain, and it's dangerous. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 19:49:39
how am i trolling? Copay is a Ios wallet?
@_date: 2017-05-26 16:38:52
i would do it. yolo. your young. if it goes down so be it. you'll have plenty of time to earn it back. 
I wouldn't put it all in BTC though. maybe like 20%
@_date: 2017-05-30 01:03:40
can someone like me get in trouble for purchasing bitcoins? I am just  a U.S college student trying to buy some bitcoins. it was just really unsettling haha.
@_date: 2017-05-26 15:25:18
i have paypal im in the us 
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:36:08
soft. i'd go in bro. it's going to the moon
@_date: 2017-07-12 18:19:58
Smart man. Graduated college last year and planning on become a tax accountant. You don't want to mess with the IRS. People who have large gains via BTC and didn't declare are going to get fucked in the future here. I believe there is no statute of limitations if you don't report a significant amount income on your return, so in essence they can go after you 5-10 years from now, that would be hanging over your head the rest of your life if you didn't pay.

thoughts? 
@_date: 2017-05-30 00:33:36
I think the country was Ukraine. And only $800. It kinda freaked me out.. I probably should only send money to US people if I every buy try to buy bitcoin again
@_date: 2017-07-27 01:20:14
lol good luck
@_date: 2017-07-20 19:56:31
BTW i am a BTC holder. I just don't agree with sites that sell to ignorant minors / young adults.
@_date: 2017-05-26 16:12:32
I agree, but don't people also move some funds to gold? bitcoin is a gold alternative. usually gold rises during recessions. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 22:11:42
agreed. people who disagree are FUDers and are shorting btc
@_date: 2017-07-13 03:51:24
When your dumping over 10k deposits in your bank account , your bank well ask where it's from. Also I think they have to report it to the IRS 
@_date: 2017-06-06 00:36:10
this will be nice for local bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 01:50:22
@_date: 2017-06-05 21:43:19
howd you get infected. do you have a mac or pc?
@_date: 2017-06-16 19:23:58
why dont you just open another checking account that allows for quick transfers like Wells Fargo or the other ones Gemini supports. Then close the checking account after? or just have 1 for crypto. is doesn't cost much or is free to open a checking account..
It'd probably be less than a week to do.
@_date: 2017-06-26 00:53:05
I BELIEVE
@_date: 2017-06-05 03:14:56
That's what happens when you live in a communist state. But how would they get a hold of someone's bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-06-03 22:11:03
Def or 10 or once I'm on the moon
@_date: 2017-06-06 00:26:08
haha rekt!
@_date: 2017-06-06 00:45:35
love this comment
@_date: 2017-06-13 23:57:21
lol that's seriously nothing! can't believe op is complaining about that.
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:28:57
I agree that should be the case for some drugs that aren't harmful, but these sites are selling drugs that can kill you. From what I've read the potency on some of these drugs are unprecedented. The police had to go in with hazmat suits to clean up and confiscate the drugs from a kids drug overdose because they were so potent. Fentanyl was the drug if I recall, its a shame these websites sell drugs like that on their website. IMO it hurts cryptocurrency
@_date: 2017-06-02 00:57:18
haha nice find, rekt!
@_date: 2017-06-02 14:59:14
I meant backed by corporate giants
@_date: 2017-06-28 23:41:25
yes. provide proof of gains too then i would consider buying it
@_date: 2017-06-13 00:33:26
I've used them countless times, they are legit bud.

same. got a trezor recently, and love it!
@_date: 2017-06-02 23:38:57
send me the bitcoin! bahah. nice investment !
@_date: 2017-06-02 21:19:02
If the price increases. More people will want in BTC. This means more people will be making transactions. The more transactions conducted = more fees for the miners (if they are paying normal fee prices) Wouldn't there be some incentive for miners then?

@_date: 2017-06-19 15:19:46
gemini by far if you're in the US. Kraken is a burden for tax purposes. also, gemini is regulated in NY and Washington.  
Much more reputable than foreign exchanges. if you are an american, who do you want handling your money? A U.S. exchange or foreign?
@_date: 2017-06-20 04:53:18
commenting so i can look back at this in 10 years
@_date: 2017-06-26 00:52:09
this is me haha
@_date: 2017-06-06 23:11:23
I was thinking a million to 1.5, with interest. But it does matter where you live, if you factor in cost of living.
@_date: 2017-06-03 13:16:09
Daddy missed you.
@_date: 2017-06-02 23:40:07

Sounds the U.S currency system 
@_date: 2017-06-13 23:58:12
says the redditor that made an account 4 weeks ago
@_date: 2017-06-14 04:09:01
good advice. I believe in BTC. I'm selling me eth. too many people are in it.
@_date: 2017-06-02 14:54:34
why would you possibly buy alt coin like Ethereum? It's controlled by corporate giants haha. So wack. When the stock market crashes etherum is going with it!
