I don't understand. If there are fewer miners, the time between mined blocks will still be the same, and if the 1MB artificial limit is removed, then there can be far more transactions per block than now.

The block size won't change too much, because this is the MAXIMUM block size, not the average or standard block size. Regardless, the blockchain can be pruned and storage is getting cheaper and cheaper.

I can send a transaction with a fee of less than a cent and have it work. Why fix what isn't broken?

Why may I not tomorrow? The blocksize cap?
@_date: 2016-04-06 23:23:17
I don't care about instant confirmations since 0-conf is good enough for most things, HD wallets take care of the privacy, and if the cap was increased, the cost of a spam attack would be far higher than what it is now (even if this means putting in a minimum fee).

the blockchain can be pruned when that time comes

I made my Coinbase wallet October 2013, and I didn't bother with filling it with money. I forgot about Bitcoin until a month ago, and I decided to check up on that wallet to see if it all is there. Turns out I signed up about a week before the explosion in price and I could have made ten fold off of Bitcoin, but I didn't put anything in there. I tried CPU mining for the past week but there are no profits and i'm going to stop soon, but I want to make some money off of it before I stop mining. The good thing is that I will be going to a Bitcoin ATM soon (STL Zoo has one about 10 minutes from it) and I am going to put in the first 20 dollars. I would have gone earlier, but I couldn't have made it and the price went up $30 since then. Wish me luck in 2016. My favorite moment was rediscovering this.
tl;dr: made a BTC wallet a week before the price explosion late 2013, but I didn't have any money in it. Gonna head out to a BTC ATM and put some funds in it for the first time ever.

Merry X-Mas and Happy Hanukkah
I'd like some BTC

I set up a full bitcoin node. I was building a program in C++ for automatic trades and profits in Bitcoin, but that stagnated.

How possible is it to detect the price of bitcoin when all of the transactions are freely available? If it is possible, make a program that automatically invests in Bitcoin from the block chain. Also, a botnet for mining bitcoins sounds devious and awesome, but how practical would that be? Maybe you can bundle this with some of your veteran programs and make some moolah off of it? I wouldn't, but it would be cool.

the HW.1 is always pretty cheap, but it isn't on sale right now

There is only one thing I know that you can try:
Before you do anything else, find a way to make a 1:1 copy of the entire phone and put it on a flash drive or something. Even if you completely reset your phone, information stays on the drive until it is overwritten. DESKTOP programs do exist that can undelete files if they haven't been overwritten, and maybe you can find your key somewhere in there (don't install an app on the phone, you might be able to do a copy from recovery mode).
Outside of that, I can't think of anything else you can do. I hope you didn't lose much.
EDIT: Here is a program you can try:

How would the latter be solved outside of a longer confirm time and or an insane amount of hobbyist compute power?
EDIT: maybe the halfing will help this naturally?

I sent out $20 to buy BTC when it was still at $430. The next morning, I woke up and the price fell to $360. Lucky me.
