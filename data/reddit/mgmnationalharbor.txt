I honestly don't think any attempt to blacklist will be given serious thought. It would collapse the BTC ecosystem with the impact felt almost immediately by every player in the space. From the miners to bfx, it would be killing the golden goose

I mean if you're picking totally arbitrary numbers you can justify anything. If Bitcoin crashes to $35 each, it will still be up 1000% from Dec 2011 when I was first exposed to it
But I for one would still be quite pissed, not sure about you!
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:32:52
It will never hit zero. I will always pay a non-zero sum for bitcoin no matter what happens, and I can’t be the only one.

Had a Mazda 3, just got a cx-5
You're just objectively wrong, it has so much more space, look at the the interior measurements if you don't believe me.
When people say this, they are talking about rear cargo space, and that's almost accurate
The cx-5 is way way nicer, and I only went up one model year. I recommend to anyone looking at crossovers, I'm getting over 27mpg over my first 2500 miles, that's the AWD GT. Sure my 3 was getting 36, but that is all it had over the cx-5 and I wouldnt go back for anything
Damn i love my cx-5

Same fucked up incentive scheme that birthed buzzfeed, vox, slate, and all the other sensationalist rags. Paying reporters for clicks instead of content means there is no reason to focus on accuracy and in fact a strongman incentive not to.

I'm not saying that they have a silent majority (LOL what a joke) 
But what you described would be characteristic of a silent majority, its kind of the definition. People who are just otherwise living their lives and won't be heard until a vote takes place. 
Now I don't think that's happening, I just don't think you understand what the term means

God I didn't realize bitcoin was primarily for buying coffee, certainly not what I use it for, cash (usd not bcash) works pretty well there, credit card even easier

Prey on people AKA be a business that needs to make a profit to exist? Just want to be clear.

On their own website, read the FAQ it is the last item on there as I recall, and makes their stance abundantly clear in no uncertain terms.
I won't go out of my way to find the link for you, I know what it says you can believe or not, or look for yourself
Have a great day :) I know it was reassuring for me. I'm going to lend through the fork on polo and count on coinbase eventually giving me my BCC should it ever have value
If you plan to immediately dump your BCC(BCH? BTCH? Bgarbage?), this won't change much for you. You would still want to get your coins off of coinbase

If bitcoin transactions took 24 hours each they would still be faster than many legacy banking systems. 
I realize in today's world of instant gratification, waiting for 20 blocks to get confirmed seems like a long time but think how long it takes for a cheque to actually clear. I know EUropeans have it a little better than us in the states, but we still use cheques a lot over here and it takes days to get the money in your account, and they can still take it back weeks later
That is part of the value proposition of bitcoin for me at least.

Because you're paying for a trusted and secured network. Similr to the reason people pay more money for an ES350 than they do for a Camry despite them being more or less the same car.
