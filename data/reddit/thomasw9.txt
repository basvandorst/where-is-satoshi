Did anyone really make it past 2017? Really?
@_date: 2019-03-03 13:39:33
I think it could confuse people who aren't crypto minded, seeing something that looks like an @ and get the wrong idea of satoshi
@_date: 2019-03-29 21:50:58
Ahhh I'm not concerned about data, all unlimited anyway, I guess that is pretty cheap then! 
@_date: 2019-03-29 21:59:59
Ahh that's pretty cool, at this point in time I don't really see the point in setting a node up myself really, nice to know I can! ��
@_date: 2019-03-29 21:42:28
How much do they cost to run then? Say, per month?
@_date: 2019-03-14 05:13:32
Ahhhhhhh yeah definitely, that would be interesting
@_date: 2019-03-14 05:08:50
Surely notes should be worth less? Or else you could but whatever you like if you've got 10 times more money
@_date: 2019-03-29 21:19:27
Is it profitable to run a node?
@_date: 2019-03-09 05:10:34
What is kyc aml? Know your customer..?
@_date: 2019-11-25 07:52:07
You can even see the ledge he walked off...
@_date: 2019-02-23 09:37:02
Sign up on their website! Lastbit.io I think
@_date: 2019-02-25 20:46:02
Oh the irony
@_date: 2019-02-21 10:24:07
I was thinking in English, con means scam :)
@_date: 2019-02-23 09:39:42
Is there an estimate on price at the moment?
@_date: 2019-02-23 11:39:21
Nice! Good to see some actual development!
@_date: 2019-02-20 17:19:14
Well that's one reason ��
@_date: 2019-02-21 09:56:35
"digitales con" is all I saw
@_date: 2019-02-25 11:37:37
This is a good thing? Sorry I'm not economically minded
@_date: 2019-06-02 20:10:31
This should be the subreddit logo
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:49:34
Hodl til I die!
@_date: 2018-11-06 01:50:43
Oh no! It's too late, I just transferred all of my Bitcoin. Reckon I'll be able to get it back???
@_date: 2018-11-06 01:41:16
Why is it Matalan/Elon musk ��
@_date: 2018-11-27 20:54:23
I think Bitcoin is complicated to buy for the regular person, it would take a significant discount for them to try and use it... 
@_date: 2018-11-28 10:08:19
99% fee, nice ��
@_date: 2018-11-28 09:56:23
Maybe it's just the places I've seen them on sale!
@_date: 2018-11-26 23:03:44
Would much prefer some other payment in coins... I guess this'll do!
@_date: 2018-11-28 09:58:14
Okay, people have proved me wrong (coinbase?) 
Where are the best places to buy coins (minimums, extra fees, bad rates?)?
@_date: 2018-11-27 21:48:42
Bitcoin except worse, I like it 
@_date: 2018-11-28 10:07:29
I have used an ATM once, I think the processing fee was about 10%
@_date: 2018-11-28 10:00:03
My point is people might be more inclined to buy a tenners worth at a time, seeing as the price can be so volatile 
@_date: 2018-11-28 10:05:29
Please elaborate?
@_date: 2018-11-06 01:54:01
@_date: 2018-11-06 01:51:40
I mean, if it's Elon musk, must be real ��
@_date: 2019-01-13 20:47:22
How does he know he's been donated 20 BTC? I SEE 57K on the screen, is that what he's referring to?
@_date: 2019-05-10 20:12:51
Lol underrated comment
@_date: 2019-05-10 16:27:40
Depends whether Facebook can make money from it
