I learned that people should pay attention to reddit... saw on multiple occasions "don't use gox". Did it anyways to trade some btc... loved the volatility to gain coin... but that's useless when you can't send out your btc... listen to reddit- beware btc-e is my current take away
@_date: 2014-05-28 03:17:29
Agreed. At least spread that shit out!!! Ask karpeles how that can turn out. I don't know if they have a cat running around that place or not though. So I probably shouldn't be so harsh

I had a similar experience with a specific cpa training materials site. Was more than willing to purchase from them if they would take btc. They said "they already accepted PayPal which is similar"... they must enjoy those fees and chargebacks I guess

Yeah I hate those holds the banks put on large deposits. oh wait unless you are talking about the FIRST TIME you buy btc that can take a few days... but that's only one time.. not like banks
@_date: 2014-05-01 14:55:32
I think it is absolutely absurd to think banks won't have a place after a full bitcoin adoption. Some banks would actually benefit from full adoption and others who rely heavily on transactional based income, I.e. nsf fees, etc... would probably not fair so well. Coming from a community bank I think that bitcoin is a step in the right direction for banking... do people really believe we could exist and thrive without banks to loan money?

Seriously that's how you treat people? Sorry OP... from everything I have garnered off of this sub mining isn't where its at. Small increments you can afford to lose are the way to go.

@_date: 2014-06-14 14:35:59
So 3000 coins for 30k? Is that what you really think will happen? Why the 200k deposit for participation? I think this auction absolutely shows that the govt sees actual value in btc. I hope you are being sarcastic and aren't really that ignorant. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 15:50:52
Either way they are hodling 10% of it. That's the most important factor to me.... shop on overstock they are awesome

I tend to want to agree with op... but your statement is indicative of your belief of absolute failure... nobody likes an absolutist dude... maybe I took it wrong... but I don't see how companies selling btc would be figuratively shitting their pants and dumping their inventory... they aren't selling retail goods here... btc has properties of a currency, property, and equity.... not the jc penny out of season wear. So tell me did I read you wrong or not?

@_date: 2014-05-09 04:00:37
Um.. can't they just sell the btc on an exchange linked to the fraternity's account... ie with coinbase and then volatility isn't an issue? I mean that's what a few THOUSAND vendors are currently doing.

Coinbase is solid. For your first trade you may have to wait a few days but then it gets to where you can instantly buy.

Oh sorry I saw where they are selling 10 "blocks" 3000 btc on 9 blocks and 2000+ for the 10th... so like I said 30k for one of the 3000 btc in one block that would require a 200k deposit... see my point yet?

@_date: 2014-04-30 16:45:11
More speculation... frb/imf is satoshi... they actually are smart. They have tricked the world into continuing to buying tbills while they swell the frb balance sheet x5 in 4 years. They know the type of inflation this will cause. Then they have 5% of all btc to be produced as an asset that won't be recognized until many years down the road... then they will be solvent with their new assets after everyone bails on the dollar and goes to btc (50 yrs until this happens).
I have virtually nothing to back this up. I just wanted to put a scenario out there where the us is really not going to try and kill btc... also did anyone else have thoughts like this when Bernanke said btc had promise?
@_date: 2014-06-06 20:22:06
Initially tried to tip 5000 but my phone changed it to 50. I went back and edited my post but changetip beat me already I guess. 
@_date: 2014-05-23 21:44:05
I think its value definitely will surpass 5k... price however may not yet support the true value, which is a hell of a lot more than 5k per btc... just my two bits
