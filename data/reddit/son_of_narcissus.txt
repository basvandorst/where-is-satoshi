"People who disagree with me ideologically? Must be young and naive kids! Oh *guys*, you'll grow out of those silly ideas in a few years :\^)"

The definition of a straw man is positing X as a legitimate rebuttal to your opponent's position when it's actually dismissing the point of the argument for a superficial victory. You replied to someone who was "baffled" they got downvoted by immediately assuming it was "many young anarchists and libertarians" somehow collectively brigading this thread, instead of entertaining the possibility that maybe, perhaps, reasonable individuals separately concluded that he doesn't really know what he's talking about. 


Ah, the classic I'm-not-racist!-I-have-black-friends card. What you happen to believe is irrelevant to this, you can't do damage control for alienating young people, anarchists, and libertarians through some last second sympathizing. 


How the fuck is this *not* a straw man, dude. 
All anarchists sport mohawks and throw molotovs at cars, right? This for sure shows that you absolutely do *not* agree "very much with many libertarian and even anarchist notions" on anything more than a superficial level, because anarchist philosophy, to your skewed understanding, necessitates radicalism if fully adopted. That's why you only *agree* with some of their 'notions', but don't fully commit to any of it, right? 


Ok, I am curious how you think internet points are anything more than a barometer of what the people who see something think of it...  do you actually believe that some downvotes are more ethically legitimate than others? 
The reddit voting system shows what people tend to think of the content. Why would you add prescriptive ethics to something that is designed to be nothing more than a popular vote? Best part is that you are apologizing for other people voting on someone's comment. Moral authority at it's finest.

When is the last time you heard of an [anarchist or libertarian resorting to radicalism]( that wasn't actually just that Sex Pistols song you heard one time?

I completely agree in that the gov't would have the *desire* to dismantle bitcoin once it threatens the dollar, but what exactly could they do? I guess this makes me naive, but there is no bitcoin headquarters, no central storage, no one to put in jail or worse...
