I don't understand why anyone who manufacture's ASIC's would ever sell them. Making the devices is 99.9% of the difficulty. hooking them up together and mining is beyond trivial.
If they know that you will profitably mine with their hardware, why would they sell it to you instead of mining it themselves? Especially considering the overhead of support, warranty, quality control, PR...etc etc.

Good. The inability of bitcoin to change adapt to scaling issues is a fatal flaw of the technology. Nobody is at fault here.
If Litecoin proves to be willing or able to adapt faster, and succeeds, then good for them. That's how competition works.

What's "true SPV" and why is it not possible? Genuinely want to know.
The way I understand it, SPV is just the ability for the node to download block header data without actual transactions, and query full nodes to receive proof of transactions existing in confirmed blocks based on the merkel root.
Is this flawed somehow?

Bitcoin is going through some pretty large scaling and development issues that aren't being resolved regarding block size. See all the drama about SegWit vs BU vs Other solutions.
There are many competing crypto currencies which were designed far later than Bitcoin and thus with a bit more wisdom and foresight. They're also smaller and more nimble.
Its quite possible that Bitcoin will dominate for years to come. It's also possible it will die off rapidly once something provably better comes along. Bitcoin could go down to $400 this summer just as easily as it could hit $2000.
