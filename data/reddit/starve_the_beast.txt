I'll take that flavor any day of the week. Theirs tastes like lies, distractions, betrayal, and media monopoly.

Your [DNC flavored kool-aid]( tastes very funny to me.

No, once per 50 years means that it happens on average, once every 50 years, meaning that after, e.g. 5000 years, you would expect the event to occur 100 times on average.
You counter-example is mistaken because we are referring to the continuous passage of time rather than a set of discrete events like coin tosses.
The premise is not "condition X existed once every 50 *times*," (that is your mistaken assumption, again). The premise is "condition X happens once every 50 *years*."
The choice of "year" is arbitrary. He could have said X occurs every 5 decades and then you would be calculating from 20% rather than 2%, with a completely different result.

Your math is off because you violated the premise with your 2% per year assumption.
A once-in-50-years expected value means a 50/50 probability of it happening every 25 years, which is also a 50/50 probability of it *not* happening every 25 years. That not-happening would be equivalent to ~4.166 6-year periods in a row of consecutive no-happenings.
So then, the equation for X where X is the probability of a happening is:
(1 - X) ^ 4.1667 = 0.5
1 - X = 0.847
X = 0.153
So there is a ~15% probability of this happening (once or more) in any given 6 year period.

Escrow for large transactions, rep/trust for small. You'll be fine. With power comes responsibility. Don't be scared of that.

Why it's almost as if there are structural forces and powerful interests who want to ensure the demise of the **amoral** protocol that threatens their monopoly.
Who would have suspected?

Who wants to drain their smarphone battery with an embedded mining chip running full-time? Adoption of the embedded miners, taking into account their actual uptime, would need to exceed exponential network hashrate increases for this to be true.
No way in hell this could be a serious threat compared to large-scale mining farms and pools.

You think the capital investments needed for such technological research, as well as the resulting intellectual property, will be put towards the service of making humanity more free and unpredictable as opposed to more docile and conditioned?
Have you been paying any attention, at all, whatsoever, to the narrative arch of history?
