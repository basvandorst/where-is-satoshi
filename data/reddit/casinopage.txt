@_date: 2018-01-26 15:31:13

@_date: 2018-01-22 17:07:23
Old people were wise, back when there was no tv and internet. Now they are just ignorant.

Hes like Shakespear, people love his work, but nobody knows his true identity
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:04:07
Because the dip started when they reposted the news
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:26:08
Calling this an throwaway Account isnt bigoted at all

I remember Jerry Seinfeld telling a story in which LuisCk is introducing him as the best comedian, right before his act. And jerry was mad about that, because people will be like:"Ohh, the best comedian ? Alright lets see what hes got

Fed meeting ? What do i have to google, to read about that. Whats does fed stand for
@_date: 2018-01-29 10:34:59
You mean many people bought because there was a breakout and people sold for less and less ?
Do you think it can go down much lower ? 
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:53:45
Waiting for 2 hours now 5/6. And it fell 200€ in that time. This was the last btc i touched for january
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:47:02

Same, the asians wok up, now the party begins.
@_date: 2018-01-29 10:22:01
Are there other Fuds besides the Usdt thing ?
Is a wall created when most people for example buy for 11400 and panick sell when its below ?
Is the actual dip coz of the Usdt fud or because banks are closed in usa and japan ?
@_date: 2018-01-30 00:24:23
Just a darknet drug dealer withdrawing some money.

Actually people mine ethereum and change it into bitcoins.

Full moon tomorrow, thats why
@_date: 2018-01-30 09:47:43
The Illuminati usually are partying at full moon, and at the end of the party everyone gets 5 Bitcoins as gift. With 300 invitations out, and death penalty as punishment for not joining the party, its 1500 new Bitcoins entering the Blockchain.

Suddenly, a flashing light appears in the sky

When i readed your rant, then your comment i bursted out laughing and thought about downvoting for fun(i didnt). Just showing you the Psychology of a fucked up human with low self esteem.
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:43:43
dude, if there is an illuminati, they either Bought most of the Bitcoins in existence and pushed it or/and they want it to be the New currency of the *New World Order*. Nothing happens without their permission, if they really exist..

Every january since 4 years btc drops, this time it droped even harder coz of the media attention. You cant beat bitcoin, nobody can
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:46:41
Thats the problem, people dont realize that Bitcoin cant be beaten, it just needs the skynet update. Lets hope lightning network comes quick
@_date: 2018-02-01 09:10:22
Move to freaking istanbul, the fuck you still doing there if this is true

@_date: 2018-02-01 14:57:54
They dont, but people are sensitive these days, it was at 20.000.
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:04:58
But does the axe deal enough dmg
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:03:59
Check the number of crashes bitcoin went trough
Check the january crashes
Stop checking the price, you invested 10k, now lean back and wait 3-5 years. It took Btc a decade to become that profitable.
Bitcoin cant be beaten, if you dont believe that, sell it as soon as it reaches 10k
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:15:24
Now i got it. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:26:44
