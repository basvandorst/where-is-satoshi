Thanks for your feedback!
I guess the limited examples should be expanded upon.
As of right now we have a gateway that you can POST a certain set of parameters to in order to facilitate a transaction. The code to do this is on the page and I'll be expanding with some more examples shortly.
We also have a WHMCS connector that handles this on your behalf, you just have to fill in the relevant bits in your WHMCS install.

Thanks for the feedback!
Good catch on the homepage typos....not sure what happened there but I'll get it updated asap.
As for transaction fee's....I put a bit of thought into this and decided that it was likely easier for merchants to deal with this in a "lump sum" transaction. That is, when merchants wish to withdraw from their account the currency exchange takes place, then and there, upon withdrawal.
That being said, I'd like to enable the most flexibility for the merchant and will probably allow the merchant to choose how they want their transactions exchanged, on the fly or lump sum. I haven't figured out a safe and easy way to get this done yet, but rest assured it's definitely on the todo list!

Yes it is a similar service, however we're aiming more towards merchants and not so much consumers at this time.
Unlike mybitcoin, we're going to facilitate full control over your account and let you pull out funds as you see fit.
We want to tackle one half of the chicken-egg problem that exists with the bitcoin community right now. That is, we want to enable merchants to accept the currency in an easy manner so they can focus on their core competencies. Thus allowing for a wider set of products and services to consume using bitcoins.
