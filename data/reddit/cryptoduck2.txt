So how will that be profitable for miners? Miners are doing this to make money surely, not for the love of Bitcoin.
You're highlighting my point, expensive settlements will put people off, but with no extra coins being produced they will only have the fees to make money with. What would change about the current situation that would cause miners to stay, in a way that they aren't currently.

I'm aware the reward halves every 4 years, but by the time we get to roughly 2040 the reward will have dropped significantly. My calculations make it (approx) 0.00000168 BTC a day by 2040. Imagine BTC is worth 100 times that by then, so just over £270,000 (English pounds). That puts the reward at 45 pence a day, at just over 2 decades. Still a while away but a lot earlier than this 2100/2150 figure I keep hearing.
So correct me if I'm wrong here, assuming btc actually gets some sort of mainstream use, that it's long term survival is based on the assumption that energy costs will drop significantly too. If so, I think this is a real concern as energy prices seem to have roughly stayed the same over the past 100 years. My folks were telling me about the advent of nuclear power, it was supposed to bring the cost down significantly (or in some cases electricity would be free). None of that turned out to be true.
Oh and thanks for the detailed reply! I appreciate your insights into this.

Serious question. I like Bitcoin, I understand the reasons it was first created. Overall I think it could be positive. When all the coins are minted the miners only get fees, how will it be sustained?  Wont settling transactions on the chain become hideously expensive? How else will the miners be incentivised?

Well, you're assuming they will be worth more. Let's assume you're correct, what would a reasonable estimation of the value of 1 BTC in 20 years time, £1 million pound sound reasonable?
by 2040 the reward will have decreased to approximately 0.00000168 BTC a day. That puts the daily reward value at £1.80 per day (at 1 million valuation), where currently miners receive approximately £17,000.
See my concern?
