I mentioned atomiic swap. Sure, by themselves they are just privacy and smart contracts....

Everybody sees tokenization of stocks and thinks....moon. Everyone seems to miss the possibility of an ad showing some company raising money through purchases of THEIR  COIN straight from your cell phone. Unless they want to go the private blockchain route and he suceptible to all kinds of security risk they will be forced to use the one crypto network that has many developers, creates tokens, allows smart contracts and has great security features. Can anyone guess which one it is? This is what makes ETH the giant elephant in the room.

The most plausible scenario that could lead to the end of Bitcoin is where all the crypto network tps are so cheap and fast that Bitcoin is used solely as a store of value and acts like a basic savings account. This will only happen decades from now when it's value just sits at some super high number and doesn't move much. It will be the most boring crypto but it will be worth a lot.

When you understand exactly why a Bitcoin ETF will do nothing but pump up and crash btc and only later push and stabilize it higher then you will be ready to invest. Don't get caught up with the Legion of dumbdumb...AKA moon boys. Btc still has at least 1 year before it could go bonkers. Learn about atomic swaps. Learn why btc is dependent on monero and eth success.  You have time to learn but avoid the moon boys all you can.

When you look at different coins in the hope that a lot of new people will come in all the sudden and just buy the ones you own so fast you will have to sell all your coins and be a millionaire and sleep with beautiful women and fly around the world staying in awesome hotels all while barely even knowing what the crypto was used for, what language it's developers use, or even how it's network is governed. I WAS a moonboy. I was apart of the legion of YouTubers, Reddit users that actually thought I was going to wake up one day at btc was going to be 3,234,789 overnight. That Tron was going to $5 by June of last year. That ripple would be $20 bucks at the same time. No particular reason, just because I thought so.
