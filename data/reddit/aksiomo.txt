Virwox? Been moving Bitcoins to Skrill for years through them.

**Even if a private PGP key is stolen it is secured by a password**
This is very simple: Ask for *proof of life* or do not donate Bitcoin.
This is what Bitcoin and technology that empowers it is about in the day and age where anything could be false. It is not about trust, it is about **verification**.

Well if you want to simply disregard UBI as to just "buying votes", fine I guess. Giving the money back to the people, that the government has stolen to fund crony capitalism, sounds quite reasonable at least for me. It certainly would empower Bitcoin in the end.

He actually wants to [stop the bureaucracy]( not the other way around. So because you believe that climate change is real (which it is) someone would "despise" Proof-of-Work? I think your assumption is wrong, he is a capitalist and [for nuclear power](

He clearly wants to get rid of onerous regulations such as NY's BitLicense that is having a *chilling effect on the US digital asset market*.
What do you suggest, doing nothing and paving the way for more bureaucracy? You have clearly been living under a rock if you believe that the average politician think Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are some "nerd game tokens". Many are looking to silently regulate it to hell. And don't you think it can not be enforced at this stage, Bitcoin has still a long way to go before it is resiliant against the governments. Mining facilities are not exactly in your average Joe's basement anymore, they can be regulated just as easy as exchanges.
If you think doing nothing on a political level is necessary, you are for sure an optimist.

How can this be the most upvoted post at Bitcoin's subreddit yet so few donations? Fucking hoarders, start using your coins. This is the address: 1J2sHg2MDg33jPYLKgpvAweHdZScR9iZjt. At the moment we have 270 upvotes, you would think there would be at least half of that amount in donation (of 1 dollar or just something). You make me sick, Bitcoiners start showing your good will again!

ANTIFA usually stands for Anti-Fascist Action. That said, I fail to see what Bitcoin has to do with fascism or anti-fascism.

Good job! We need to encourage this switch and you take the lead, sir!
