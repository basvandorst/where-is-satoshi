Cant go wrong with Bfx, and now that its the USD exchange leader your $$$ is 100x safer there than on Btce. Also been providing liquidity since early dec13 and have made a fucking killing...

any financial instrument bought in bulk is usually bought at a premium, as buying a shitload of something drives the price uppp

have you ever heard the old wall street maxim buy on the rumor and sell on the news? The hearings were positive yesterday and it didn't jack up BTCs price whatsoever. I think its super clear, especially now, that good news doesn't affect BTC anymore as its so overbought right now... the only way I could ever see it going up right now is if someone like Amazon said they were going to start accepting it

I just did by selling futures on ICBIT. I was fairly late to the BTC trading scene (I started in March of 2013) but I was long 20k futures contracts right after the SR crash and kept reinvesting a good portion of my earnings with 4:1 leverage all thru nov and early dec, so even thou I wasn't an early adopter/early miner I was able to see a %10000 return IN 45 DAYS on my initial investment. Don't get me wrong- Its never advisable to get long futures completely naked (its actually a completely retarded thing to do), the only reason I had that position in late Oct was because 1. I'm an adrenaline junkie and 2. I felt I was a bit under capitalized. The pros on that site have always been the arbitragers (those who sell futures and hedge with buying BTC). This type of arbitrage yields about a %70 APR thats virtually risk free (theres small counterparty risk which has nearly been negated now due to various new margin rules, rules modeled similarly to the rules governing CME's most volatile commodities as well as the risk of the exchange going out of business, which is unlikely as they've been around since november 2011) but this type of strategy takes a large amount of capitalization, I would say a minimum of 50k to see a decent APR + also be liquid enough to tweak your positions quickly and efficiently to stay delta neutral

this is a completely invalid analogy as none of the exchanges in question have recently halted USD Wds. The USD halt is why Gox traded higher for 8 months and with usd was halted no one had the incentive to sell btc-usd on gox, thus artificially inflating the price...

I completely agree about the lack of volume, but on ICBIT I've been able to sell at least 2k contracts a day on the offer and hedging appropriately/buying btc I've been locking in an average of a 20 percent return on the March contracts. Why use Bitfinex if I'm able to lock in almost double the rate of return on ICBIT?

its all about how much time u want to spend watching the swaps market.
Personally I check in twice a day for about five minutes each time, and I auto lend at a fixed rate usually about 20-30% higher than the flash return rate (variable rate). Usually all my offers get hit at that level but they're not high enough either where peeps will cancel after 6 hours if rates fall dramatically. This strategy imo is the best bang for your time/buck

premium value is accrued by the most liquid, trusted exchange. You yourself said you don't consider btce a serious (trusted) exchange which is why btce always trades at a lower rate/premium. Finex finally becoming  USD  exchange in the last 36 hours after 8 months of competition w stamp perfectly justifies the increased finex-stamp premium variance which again did not just coincidentally start 36 hours ago...
@_date: 2014-06-11 12:15:19
you really think its a coincidence that finex finally passes stamps 30 day vol 24-36 hours ago and suddenly (24-36 hours ago) theres %2 variance between exchanges ???
@_date: 2014-06-11 12:27:52
all large sales have been coordinated on finex and stamp, no reason to sell on btce w/o finex/stamp premium
@_date: 2014-02-15 23:27:07
r u joking? we just saw %250 percent volatility the day before last...
@_date: 2014-01-29 18:36:13
Also its been trending down all month so no it hasn't been coming back fast....
@_date: 2014-01-29 18:28:09
r u serious??? the premium on ICBIT is between %17-25 percent which blows bitfinexes rates of return outta the water!
@_date: 2014-01-29 18:46:32
I was massively long futures all through Nov and Dec. Im talking about shorting it in the short term, obviously I believe in it long term, as I stated above
@_date: 2014-06-11 11:56:16
this is simply because Finex has now totally surpassed stamp as the volume leader which intern gives finex a higher premium as its the safest, most liquid and sophisticated exchange in the btc financial world.
Further support to this logic: As we have seen, this %2 spread started 36 hours ago when finex surpassed stamps 30 day volume total

so youre not registered with FINcen or have a bit-licence??

I'd agree with this, but only in U.S. markets. In China its accepted virtually everywhere, has a massive legal framework. As a former BTC p2p dealer in NYC, 98% of my clients we're using it for criminal purposes. I realize my role as a p2p dealer encouraged grey clients so my client base was skewed towards illegal use but being in the BTC community for 6 years now and standing back and looking at the industry as a whole- legal adoption in the U.S. hasn't sky-rocked like it has in China, Japan, Argentina etc.

well that answers my question above. So youre paying the quarter million in NYFSD fees and lawyer fees? hopefully you dont get rejected and lose that quarter million
