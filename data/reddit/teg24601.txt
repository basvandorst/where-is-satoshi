I never cared.  I recouped my investment (hardware, power, etc), and am letting the rest ride.

This is especially true for debit/credit cards.

I thought CEX was just something local. They have a store in one of our malls in the states. This one uses £, which causes me to assume it is somewhere in the UK. I'm just surprised because they just appeared one day, and to know it is something bigger, it interesting.

They were attempting to save the 2%-10% transaction fee imposed by various banking institutions.
@_date: 2014-06-09 00:49:20
That was my thought.  I'm just attempting to gather the information.

I have a similar issue with ClamXAV on my Mac.  I ended up just not having it scan the block chain folders.
@_date: 2014-08-02 00:34:01
I do.

We travel all the time, however this is the first time they are driving across the US, then into Canada, and they don't want to be loaded down with cash, and think that Travelers Checks are passé.  They are really concerned with keeping costs down, and the transaction fees to convert money bother my dad.

A - Everything is stored on the device(s), not the cloud.
B - Bad passwords caused the leaks, not bad security.

These new electronic menus also show what will happen with $15 minimum wage... just saying.

That is was I suggested to them, but they are still thinking about it.
@_date: 2014-06-08 23:23:01
I am aware of it, but they are trying to reduce the amount of cash they take with them, because they are traveling across the US first, and don't really want that much cash on hand.

I can't speak about Ebay/PayPal, but I believe that Apple's position has changed largely due to advise from their legal council, the opinions of the shareholders, and the losses to Android by BTC users.  Once the IRS finally made their opinion known, and it wasn't up-in-the-air as to the legality of Bitcoin (regardless of your opinion about the IRS findings) Apple started changing their tune.  I doubt that payments for apps or features can be done using BTC anytime soon, but at least they are allowing Bitcoin to be used for other transactions, just like cash and cards can be used on the Square Register or other credit card readers.  Give it a few years, and Apple may even start accepting Bitcoins for payments on devices and services, but for now, they are just dipping their toes in the water.

It might actually be easier to get them to actually practice what they preach, instead of being a bunch of hypocritical assholes.

I've been to ours twice.  I actually picked up the TNG in HD Blu-Ray set for $40, when it is $70+ new, and it had only been released the previous month.  That is the only reason it even sticks out in my mind.
@_date: 2014-06-08 23:22:11
I was not aware of that.  Thanks for the Info.
@_date: 2014-06-07 18:43:24
Logic.  There has been so much Apple bashing here, and as a shareholder, I have sent several letters (along with others I know) to Apple telling them that I did not agree with their previous stance towards BitCoin.
@_date: 2015-01-03 15:37:49
It isn't like Apple isn't a litigious company.
@_date: 2014-10-24 15:35:08
I thought CEX was just something we had here in one of our malls.  I'd never seen it anywhere else.  Then to see it in the UK... Amazing.

As someone who works for a company using the same equipment as at&amp;t, that isn't possible. Plug directly into the modem/router and your problem is solved.

And they hate everything related to BTC, whereas this sub seems to be at least willing to hear them out, so long as they make a rational argument (which is rare)
@_date: 2018-04-24 18:06:37
And r/btc is full of BCH people. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 01:46:59
When they got buthurt about  being pulled from a BCH supporter and moved to a BTC supporter, I had to nope out of their caterwauling.

Actually, tunneled transportation systems seem to be safer for earthquakes as they move with the Earth.  After the 1989 Earthquake in the Bay Area, the BART was back up and running in hours, while the bridges were still closed as the bridges moved much more and had much more damage inflicted on them.
