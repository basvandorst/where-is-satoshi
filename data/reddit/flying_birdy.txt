The other post I primarily talked about nothing but team sponsorships, I forgot tournaments. Again, no sponsorship contracts are known, but you can get a good idea from the operating costs.
I going to group tournaments into 3 categories. Large LANs, Small LANs, Online only.
**Large LANs**
Large LANs are your MLGs, Dreamhacks, and ESLs. These have base prize pools of 100k+ (that usually gets doubled through some crowd sourcing) and operating costs of ridiculous amounts. These are the "premium products" if you will. These have viewership of 250k concurrent easily for important tournament deciding games and 70-100k concurrent for less important ones (such as group stages). Though, probably not something you will be interested in due to cost and price. 
**Small LANs**
Typically, your small LAN tournament now-a-days have prize pool of 30-50k. These tournaments will also have a small scale LAN final for a limited audience (100-300 at a hotel or a convention center). Operating costs would probably be in the 80-200k range after taking into account staff+LAN costs. Examples of small LANs are Starladder and the D2CL and the D2L.  
These small tournaments will typically host an online group/qualifier stage that feeds into the LAN finals. Typically, group stages are about 20 best of threes (approximately 2 hours per BO3) with an additional 4-8 BO3 during LAN. Group stages averages about 20-30k concurrent viewers on the English stream and another 20-30k on the Russian stream (I have no idea what this translates into in terms of uniques). LAN playoffs typically have average viewership of 60k concurrent English, 60k concurrent Russian, 40-60k Chinese. 
Edit: here's an infographic from a small scale LAN produced by ESL last year.
According to this, there was 2.5million unique viewers.
**Online Tournaments**
Purely online tournaments were prevalent 3 months ago and now have decreased in numbers significantly. They used to be incredibly cheap to create and generated, in my opinion, ridiculously good viewer numbers for their cost. Viewership numbers averaged 30-60k concurrent, for 100~ games, for about only 10-20k operating costs. Larger online tournaments pulled in upwards of 250k concurrents. However, as competition increased in the scene, the number of small, purely online tournaments have dwindled and increased in cost in recent months. Right now, there is only two purely online tournaments operating - MLG TKO and the XMG captain's draft invitational. 
Using XMG invitational as an example. The tournament has costs of 20k in prize pool and probably an additional 1-3k in administrative. The tournament is generating some revenue through ingame tickets, aproximately 7k tickets have been sold at a price of $10 each (but no one knows what's the split is on the tickets between organizer/Valve ). There is also some revenue from stream ad revenue (again, no one knows exactly what those are).
XMG invitational has fifteen BO3, group stage matches and three BO5, playoff matches. All in all, you are looking at about 40-50 hours worth of programming (2 hours for BO3 and 3 hours for BO5, not including downtime which can be significant). Viewership is typically in the 20-60k concurrent range (50-50 Russian/English split). 
**These smaller sized online tournaments are probably what you guys should be looking at. I would say sponsorship packages will be typically be 10-20k depending on the organizer and number of sponsors in said tournament. ROI is 20-60k concurrent for 40-50 hours of programming.**

It's fairly safe to say there's a lot of cross pollination between DotA2 and SC2 and that the age demographic is similar. Whether LoL and SC2 share the same demographic is questionable.

Long time lurker and Dota 2 fan here, I know a little bit but you are best off contacting 2GD. Sponsorship details are not disclosed by eSports clubs in Dota2. But, you can probably get a good idea of the price range based on team salaries that have been revealed in the past.
It is fairly well known that top Chinese clubs (iG, LGD, DK) pay their players a salary around 10k+ RMB/month each (which translates to about 1.5k+USD/month). Recent player contract transfers between Chinese clubs had transfer fees upwards of 81k USD. 
A contract was released by the Chinese team, Rattlesnake (now known as speed gaming) when they signed 5 western players. 
The contract included a salary of approximately 1-2k per month depending on results and also covered most/all travel expenses. 
Dota 2's most well known player, Dendi, is rumored to have a salary of 2.5k per month. ( the person stating Dendi's salary is Winter, a well known dota2 player with presumably insider knowledge). 
Having discussed salaries, non-salary team expenses can be estimated as well. For 2014, most top DotA2 teams will participate in 4-6 LAN tournaments (a significant increase from the previous year), with the vast majority being in Europe. Travel expenses for 5 players plus 1 support staff should range from 3-4k per tournament per team for European teams and much higher for American ones who frequently fly to Europe. While many tournaments now do have decent travel subsidies, it by no means covers all expenses required. All in all, tournament travel expenses of 10-20k per year should be a reasonable guess.
Most DotA2 teams do not live together in a team house. Some do bootcamp for about a month before a major tournament. These costs are presumably much lower relative to tournament travel expenses, $1000 is a safe estimate. 
So, not including salaries of any administrative staff and non-competition related administrative fees, I think its fair to say that the typical costs of operating a top-tier DotA2 team is about 100-140k. A note about administrative staff - their salaries are presumably a lot lower in non-western teams (who sometimes get equal to greater ROI from western audiences, good examples being DK or Na'Vi).
Revenue for these teams comes predominately from sponsorship. There has been a recent expansion into other avenues such as DotA2 ingame items with team branding. However, this revenue source is relatively new and its impact has not been fully demonstrated. 
Another form of sponsorship that has yet to be discussed but may be of interest is studio sponsorship (studios are the broadcasting groups that specializes in operating/casting tournaments for organizers). The most prominent studios right now are Joindota, Beyondthesummit, TheGDStudio and starladder. I believe 2GD did reveal the sponsorship given to him by ASUS on one of the episode of a show called live on three. He stated that ASUS provided him with 22k in sponsorship for that year. Studios/casters can have just as much if not more fans than teams.
Edit: I found a news source that somewhat confirms my estimates. When Rattlesnake, the Chinese organization, made an attempt to expand through picking up a western team, they stated that this initial effort required an investment on their end of approximately 200k. This investment includes salaries, travel costs from Europe/US to China (which is 1-2k per person per round trip just for plane tickets), team house and computer equipment.
Edit 2: all this being said, expenses are probably much much lower for lower tier teams.
Edit 3: didn't realize how much I typed. So here's a TL:DR
**TL:DR Top DotA2 teams have expenses of approximately 100-140k per annum not counting club administrative costs.**
