The fed won't raise interest rates because low interest rates prop up the stock market.  The US won't default, because they will just print more money, and we won't enter hyperinflation because its hard to hyperinflate 60T dollars (ie. what you're going to print 60,000T dollars?) 
Threat to the dollar exists in the form of countries leaving the USD as the reserve currency, in which case we'll see the value of the dollar cut in half or so.

They will leave more for political reasons than economic.  A number of countries would like to move past a US dominated world; Russia, China, Iran, etc.  But then again China props up the value of the dollar compared to the Yuan because it keeps Chinese goods cheap... so they have tradeoffs to consider.
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:23:58
The reason that the dollar is not similar to zimbabwe is that there is a huge amount of dollars... lets say 60T or so.   So in order to double that supply and cut the savers in half you would need to print 60T dollars.  That's why it doesn't happen.  He's been singing that tune for like 10 years, and also he sells gold, so he's not a disinterested party.

People want to increase Bitcoin's ability to be a payment network (eg buy coffee with it), but at the moment the transaction fees are high (because they are denominated in BTC and a fraction of a BTC is still high)
The utility of BTC at present is a store of value that is difficult to confiscate and can be transported across borders.  
Bitcoin should be preferred by people under governments that debase their currency (Latin America, South America) or governments that unreasonably seize assets (Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Sub-Saharan Africa), or in the case of war (when the loser's currency goes to zero) or just as a hedge against inflation like gold
* What is the chance of war in a region? 
* What are the chances the government cannot pay its bills (and therefore must debase the currency by printing money)?
* What is the level of economic stability in a region (government won't steal your bank account)?  
* Will the government declare the money useless like in India recently?
All these questions must be brought to bear to deduce a value of Bitcoin at some point in the future...

Mis-allocation of time / money is a regret almost everyone has in one way or another.  If you want to feel better make a goal and write down how you are going to get to achieve that goal, in as much detail and include sub-steps.  Then start scheduling it and moving towards it.  The only way to feel better is to start allocating your resources in a way that is consistent with your goals

I don't know much, but you buy the option to buy Bitcoin in the future for price $X, because you think at that time it will be trading at more than $X... so we get some price prediction data.
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:38:21
The payment use case right now is more in remittances.  So calculate the value of the remittance market and expect Bitcoin to take a percentage of that market.  
Then review the store of value use case.  Stores of value are quite strange and their prices can go crazy ($1 million for a bottle of wine, $400m for a painting, $60 million for a car)  Bitcoin will take a percentage of this market
Many countries (Middle East) don't trust their banks and use real estate in the West (N.A / Europe) as a store of value.  So Bitcoin will take a percentage of this market
Gold, Diamonds (mobile stores of value) - Bitcoin will take a percentage of this market  
If the scaling issues are solved then expect Bitcoin to take a percentage of Paypal / Visa / Mastercard business
Then add a few hundred billion for the coming conflict between the West, Russia and China... which will create billions of people who want to move their assets to South America / Africa

The market is treating Bitcoin as an appreciating store of value,  therefore the fees don't matter that much.  Lower fees are great if you want to spend, but its not economically rational to spend something that's going up in value so fast (unless you really need the money)

“Briefly stated, the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect is as follows. You open the newspaper to an article on some subject you know well. In Murray's case, physics. In mine, show business. You read the article and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues. Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backward—reversing cause and effect. I call these the "wet streets cause rain" stories. Paper's full of them.
In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story, and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about Palestine than the baloney you just read. You turn the page, and forget what you know.”

Its not a dividend paying asset.  
Instead look to the utility.  The utility of sending $1000 over the Internet is greater than the utility of sending $100 over the Internet, so we have a virtuous cycle, the more the price increases the greater the utility, but there is competition from alt-coins and regulatory threats keeping the price down.  As the price increases the store of value use case gets stronger and the payment channel use case gets weaker.

You can cash it out, but there's a tax penalty, because the basic premise of 401k is that 'pre-tax money' is the input, so when you take it out that's a taxable event.  
For a highly negative opinion of 401k see the documentary 'The Retirement Gamble' 
tldr; these funds assume 0% risk and take 1% off the top.  And that 1% is the difference between 5% and 4% gains.  Compounded over time is hundreds of thousands of dollars.

When you plug in the trezor it generates your wallet words (24 words) that can be used to retrieve your wallet without your trezor.  So the wallet words need to be more secure than the trezor.  Some people secure their wallet words with crypto-steel (fireproof way to store the wallet words)

There's a sub. In general its hard to buy hardware.  Sometimes its delayed for six months, or other various shady things happen, so you really need to do your research before you order.  Another issue is that the hashrate keeps going up so that if you expect to mine 1 BTC per year at current rates, if there is a six month delay on your order -- maybe the hardware will only deliver 0.5 BTC per year at that time.  I think it is profitable if you know what your doing, but there are many ways to screw it up, also its relevant what your electricity prices are.

Coinbase is fairly easy to buy, but they have purchasing limits, so you might not be able to get them very quickly.  Once you have them you transfer to a hardware wallet like trezor (to reduce exchange hacking risk).  If you lose your hardware wallet you can still access your keys by a 24 word passphrase (wallet words) that you can punch into another program.  The trezor is pin locked, choose a good pin 8 digits or so.  The wallet words must be kept more safe than the trezor and must never be stored on a computer.  Some people recommend cryptosteel to secure the wallet words.  When you transfer money double check the address (there is no undo function)

It is a system that converts electricity into trust.  Its protected by a network effect, and its value is following Metcalfe's Law.

There are risks involved in sending your BTC/B2X after the fork (including possible 51% attack).  Don't move money after the fork until we get some clarity on the issues.   
In terms of monetary risk, I'm expecting to shapeshift my B2X into BTC and get about $1000-$2000 per coin based on the futures market.  The true downside risk is one of the chains dies and you pick the wrong chain.  Of course you could hedge your bet and not shapeshift and just say, "well I don't care b/c I have coins on both chains" -- you will still be presented with the problem of what coins to buy in the future, btc or b2x?

Here's what happened last time.  I bought Bitcoin on Coinbase, I transferred to Trezor wallet.  Bitcoin Cash fork happened.  Coinbase users are locked out of Bitcoin Cash until January.  Trezor supported Bitcoin Cash a few days later.  Then I watched the price and shapeshifted my Bitcoin Cash into Bitcoin... So I got about 10 % extra BTC after the shapeshift if my memory serves.  
B2X is a dirty fork, so its unclear what will happen, but if replay protection is enabled and its safe to shapeshift, the futures markets are currently giving B2X as 15% value of a BTC, so if you have 1 BTC before the fork, and replay protection is added and trezor adds support for B2X, then you will be able to dump your 2X and shapeshift into 1.15 BTC.

Its better to buy before the fork, because after the fork you will have to choose if you want BTC or B2X.  
If you hustle you might be able to buy that amount of BTC before the fork.  This includes...
* 1) Choosing an exchange
* 2) Getting verified by the exchange (might take a few days)
* 3) Buying Coins (making sure your bank tolerates money going to chosen exchange)
* 4) Your weekly buy limit... Its possible that the exchange only allows you to buy $1k per week because you are new and untrusted (Coinbase works like this, your buy limit increases over time)
* 5) Time it takes for coins to arrive in wallet after purchase (for Coinbase its instant with CC, but with ACH its like 5 days)
* 6) Transfering coins to hardware wallet so you can have maximum control by the time the fork hits.

10 trezors with 10k each, if somebody cloud cracks your passphrase (unlikely), then you only lose 10k.
That mitigates cloud attack vector.  Next if you are moving money... only move 5k at a time then wait to see it on your trezor -- this mitigates malware issues (if you have malware you will notice your small amount of money not going thru) -- as well as copy paste errors... and so on.

Every asset is a ponzi scheme if you redefine ponzi scheme to mean something you want to sell for more money in the future.  
A real ponzi scheme is something that pays out interest with new entrants money instead of dividends / appreciation.  
Bitcoin pays no interest therefore its not a ponzi scheme.

One month ago coinbase was adding 20k users per day, today they are adding 50k users per day.  If you graph the accelerating rate of adoption... its quite something.
