Yeah, the Rain Main hint tells me that days of the week are important - somehow. Whether through u/izzy91 's method or another. Finding ESCAPE as 617 was very interesting, but there's still the 13, 14 problem with that approach, whereas with the "one entry equals one letter"  approach, the number of entries pretty closely matches what one would expect with a phrase 12 words long (67 entries, vs an expected 64.8 letter phrase). Given that there is no 13, 14 problem in the APOLOGY puzzle, I would say that having an 'extra' amount of index numbers than words isn't an inherent part of the puzzle, assuming this puzzle is supposed to be solved using the same logic as the APOLOGY puzzle

I believe each number/date combo corresponds to a letter, but I'm out of ideas as to how these might correspond to each other. My reasoning is that with an average word length in bip39 of 5.4, phrases of length 12 are on average 64.8 letters long, and our date set contains 67 number+dates. Not too far off from 64.8
 I'm trying to use all available information, which means also using the APOLOGY puzzle to learn anything at all. Maybe my attempt will help someone else.
I started by trying to consider how the date set given differs from what one would expect from a randomly generated list of 67 dates. There are a bunch of deviations in both this puzzle and the APOLOGY puzzle. Whether these give a hint as to the inner workings of the algorithm that generated the lists: I don't know. But this puzzle and the APOLOGY puzzle both exhibit some nonrandomness, sometimes in similar ways. Below is a summary of observed and expected values:
**Observed days of month (expectation: \~2.3 for each (67/30)):**
6th of the month happens 6 times
3rd of the month happens 4 times
20th of the month happens 4 times *(in the APOLOGY puzzle, the 20th came up 5 times, and all 5 of those were Wednesdays)*
**Observed Months of the year (expectation: \~5.6 for each (67/12)):**
April happens 12 times *(in the APOLOGY puzzle, April was also also about 2X overrepresented at 11)*
Jan happens 9 times *(in the APOLOGY puzzle, Jan happened 9 times also)*
Feb happens only 1 time *(in the APOLOGY puzzle, Feb was also underrepresented at 1)*
Mar happens only 2 times
**Observed days of the week (expectation:  \~9.6 (67/7)):**
Tuesday comes up 13 times
Saturday comes up 12 times
Sunday comes up 11 times
Thursday comes up 12 times
Wednesday comes up only 5 times
(For days of the week distribution in the APOLOGY puzzle, it also looks nonrandom, with overrepresentation of Fri (11), Wed (11), Sun (14), and underrepresentation of Thurs(3))
**Year repetitions:**   ***(in the APOLOGY puzzle, there were also 4 years that come up three times)***
4 years come up 3 times (2002, 2015, 2012, 1950)
13 years come up twice
**Exact date duplicates:**
I thought I could somehow correlate these over/under-representations with the frequencies of letters in the BIP39 wordlist:
a-8.29% b-2.17% c-4.65 d-3.44 e-12.33 f-1.85 g-2.46 h-2.57 i-6.6 j-0.26 k-1.17 l-5.6 m-2.93 n-5.86 o-6.67 p-3.04 q-0.19 r-7.94 s-5.79 t-6.89 u-3.9 v-1.36 w-1.45 x-0.38 y-1.9 z-0.28
but have had no success so far. I'm most interested in just seeing the solution at this point
