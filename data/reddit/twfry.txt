Lighting networks will pull fees from the mainchain, this is a major fork to the network. Why no discussion? 
Why is this just accepted without any analysis. How do we know there are not adverse effects?
More importantly, why do a small group of people get to dictate this fork, while at the same time stop a much less impactful blocksize increase?
Bitcoin is suppose to be defined by it's users. But more an more it looks to be the same at the FED.

Agreed, let's remember that *miners* connect to pools using the stratum protocol. Stratum only requires &lt;1kbps and it is easy to connect a miner to any pool anywhere in the world. (I used to use a pool in Australia ~5000 miles away)
It is trivial for any chinese miner (whether large or small) to connect a pool outside of china or in a large well connected chinese city if they want to stay local. 
It looks as if those making this claim simply picked the pools it would be hardest to track down replies from on purpose. Well I call BS too, largely because the arguments that large blocks hurt miners is nonsense, even if they are located in remote china.

Remember that 1MB blocks is a fork from Satoshi's original vision, whitepaper &amp; implementation. 
Satoshi designed Bitcoin so that it could scale to include all transactions, and it can. That is why the header chain and merkle trees were designed to enable SPV light wallets and pruned blocks. 
Satoshi only put the limit in as a temporary measure that was meant to be lifted after SPV light wallets were available.
The core dev's calling gavin's XT a fork and GavinCoin are being disingenuous here. It is keeping the 1MB limit that is a fork to create BlockstreamCoin.

Better yet, let's have 10 github repo's named Bitcoin A, B, C, D, etc. and let the users, exchanges, miners, pools, merchants and nodes form consensus (even if it's messy) on their own.

The reason this does not work well in practice, is that the chances of success are only as good as the chances the miner has on finding the next block. 
If the majority of miners follow the standard behavior and only include the first transaction seen, then the odds of being successful here are low. And if your chances of a successful double spend attack are low, then it's not practical in most situations.

In a decentralized political system (which the US used to be and which you are advocating for) if CA enacts universal health care, people who disagree with this can leave CA and go somewhere else. The whole point is they have a choice. 
What is advocating for is for individuals to not have a choice, but be forced into anything he deems is "right" to be enacted at a level where individuals do not have a choice. And his fall back argument is always absurd racist nonsense, because statists are also usually consumed by race.

Bitcoin is decentralized by the mining process, not by nodes. 
Miners on pools are not effected by the blocksize, they don't even see it. At the same time pools are already large centralized entities and can easily handle large blocks. 
The Bitcoin security mechanism is mining, and mining will remain just as decentralized with large blocks as with small blocks.

To me the problem now isn't the 20MB increase, it is how blatantly absurd Greg, Peter and the other blockstream devs have shown themselves to be.

To me this means it is imperative to branch off of their code base and onto something more neutral. MIT's Bitcoin XT looks to be that alternative for now, and so I'm switching regardless of the block increase path taken now.

And don't forget the security model of bitcoin, which is the mining process. The mining process is largely not effected by blocksize. Individual miners on pools do not see the blocksize, and pools are already centralized to an extent and the existing ones are large enough to handle large blocks. 
Additionally, a larger # of end-users grows the total ecosystem which increases the amount of fees and in the long run increases security.

More transactions = more fees. That is how it works. 
People pay fees because there is a requirement for fees, and because miners are financially incentivized to not include zero free transactions. The more widely used bitcoin is the more fees and the better the security. 
The view the creating artificial scarcity will someone drive fees is completely absurd. It will simply make bitcoin become unused as no one will be able to effectively use it without waiting forever for processing.

It's completely crazy, the default behavior of the P2P network is to reject the 2nd seen transaction on a given unspent output. This enables zero confirm transactions for nominal amounts. 
Even if a some corrupt miners decide to implement a backchannel to include double spend transactions, as long as a majority of miners behave according to the normal and honest behavior, then the chances of such an attack working are low because the chances of success are only as good as the corrupt miners chances of finding the next block. And if your chances of success are low or only moderate, then it is not a useful attack in most situations. 
The original behavior of Bitcoin is very carefully balanced. Screwing with this is absurd. 
While increasing the blocksize is standard behavior and always expected according to the original implementation. You are right, I can't understand their position here.

The problem is we had nothing similar to today's money-transmission laws in 1860, nothing. It is a fabrication. 
That is not to say there were zero laws regarding money in 1860, there were. But everything about them was different, from the laws creators (NYDFS type regulatory agencies didn't even exist then), to intent, to enforcement. 
Lawsky is saying that we have had today's money-transmission laws since 1860, and so they need to be updated for today. But the reality is today's money-transmission laws are only a generation or two old, are not part of the traditional American tradition of liberty, and are drastically more draconian than anything in the 1800s.

That is clearly not the case. 
"It" refers to the cumulative total size of all the blk*.dat files, which is the blockchain size. That is why the * is there. He was not referring to a single file, but the size of all of them. 
That is also why he discusses client-only nodes (i.e. SPV wallets). Satoshi's statement is until we have SPV wallets, he wanted to keep the blockchain small so new users could quickly get started. And that once we had an SPV option, then the blocksize did not matter since most users would use an SPV wallet and were not impacted by blockchain size. 
His intentions are clear. It's not what you are suggesting

By not clearing transactions in blocks and causing the memory pool to increase beyond what it should, the 1MB limit is probably more stressful on nodes than simply letting larger blocks get processed.

This brings up a very important question.
Currently you have to declare if you are traveling internationally with over $10K, but it is legal to do so.
Now with Bitcoin, if you travel internationally with the private keys to bitcoin addresses totaling over $10K is it necessary to declare them or not? The law is very unclear here.
Also what constitutes carrying bitcoin? Does having the public keys stored in your phone count? Do you have to have the private key on your person? What if you stored the private key encrypted? What if you stored the private key somewhere online, but have the access key on your laptop, does that mean you are carrying bitcoin?
Personally, if I was traveling internationally or through any TSA style checkpoint I would NOT have the private key on my person in any form. What if it is confiscated and the coins disappeared? Instead I would only travel with the keys encrypted and hidden somewhere not noticeable (such as a tmp file) with backups stored elsewhere in case my phone/computer/possessions were confiscated.

Georedd, this is one of the more accurate explanations I've seen in awhile, thank you.
When Jefferson said his vision for America was a nation of independent farmers who owned their own land, he was not advocating for an agricultural society. He was advocating for a society where each person/family was self sufficient, because only through self sufficiency can people truly lead free lives. 
In pre-industrial times the rulers were those who owned the land, and everyone else had to rely on land owners for their livelihood, either in a feudal system, indentured servitude, etc. Only those who owned their own land could truly escape. 
Today a major issue is the cost &amp; tax structure prevents true self sufficiency. All people except for the 1% have to keep on the tread mill to maintain the various forms of rent imposed. Many in the middle class pay close to 50% in taxes, which means for 6 months a year you are a slave to the state. On top of that government mortgage manipulation raises the cost of housing to take a decent chunk of the rest. With that it is difficult for most to save enough to become truly self sufficient, something that was more common in the 1800s. 
Today, in many ways we've circled back to feudal times, just in a different manner and with better technology that keeps most people comfortable.

That does not factionalize bitcoin, but creates artificial demand for USD that counters against real market demand for BTC. 
Let's say you want to buy and hold 10 BTC with coinbase (i.e. create market demand for ~$6K worth of BTC). You give coinbase $6K and they buy and hold 10 BTC ($6K worth) for you in their online wallet. Coinbase then is forced to purchase some amount of USD, lets say $5K, to hold in their reserves. 
This means that your 6K worth of "market demand" to sell USD and buy BTC, also creates "regulatory demand" to re-purchase $5K of USD.  The only reason I can see for this is to slow the market price growth of BTC. 
If the NYDFS was truly concerned with firms' reserves, then in this situation coinbase should only be forced to hold matching BTC reserves to back customer funds (i.e. have 10 BTC to match a customers 10 BTC). This makes sense.
What is sick about the regulations as proposed is the massive double standard. Banks lend out more than 10 times their dollar deposits today. That is the entire fractional banking model, but bitcoin firms instead aren't just suppose to hold 1-for-1 bitcoin reserves (which they should) but also hold dollar reserves. 
So banks only require 10% backing, but bitcoin wallet firms require 100% backing in USD. Got it?

The banks can get away with 8% backing (over 10-to-1 leverage) because the FED can print money and provide liquidity on demand. Without this ability to provide liquidity on demand, banks would experience runs and all go under within 24 hours. That is what happened to Bear Stearns, the FED basically telegraphed that they would no longer swap bank assets for liquidity, and the run was immediate. Prior to the FED banks operated with over 50% capital (less than 2-to-1 leverage) because any who went over faced real market consequences. 
In bitcoin there is no entity who can provide liquidity on demand, the FED could not save a bitcoin wallet service since it just can't magically create money out of thin air and swap with banks as needed. 
This is death to the modern banking business model and the entire absurd bonus/salary compensation model. That's what this regulation is really trying to go after, bitcoin is a threat to the absurdly high compensation model in NYC.

The problem with NYDFS's approach is it is opposite from how most regulatory bodies have gained control over a sector in the past, and shows a high level of over confidence that quite possibly will backfire. 
Most regulatory agencies start small and narrow. They establish down reasonable rules that most people agree with. Then after legitimacy is established, they expand more and more regulations together with the largest firms in that industry, until a nice cozy mutually beneficial ecosystem is created that benefits both the regulators and crony capitalists. This has happened everywhere, just look at taxis and uber for a good case study.
But NYDFS did not take this path with bitcoin.
Instead they started with rules most users and startups could not possibly follow. They also threw out the entire concept of equal protection under the law by saying banks don't have to follow the same rules. It is so obvious that most bitcoin users (who are already a self selected group prone to be skeptical of government) will feel justified in ignoring the rules, and in addition have the tools to do so. 
NYDFS runs a very real risk here that the bitcoin ecosystem simply "exits NY" and operates outside of the state for all legitimate businesses, while in-state residents bypass with tor and VPNs. Once NYDFS is shown to be toothless, it will be harder for them to come back with something reasonable. 
Oh, and just wait for OpenBazaar enabling full global commerce fully outside of the regulator's control.

@_date: 2014-07-17 20:22:23
Exactly, 
Notice how all regulation addresses 3rd party services in the bitcoin ecosystem, but not Bitcoin itself.
The reason is they can attack 3rd party services that are centralized, but it is simply impossible to attack the Bitcoin P2P network itself. The OP and banks probably understand by now that any attempt to attack/regulate Bitcoin would be a massive failure and simply demonstrate just how resilient the network is. The OP can put whatever rules in place they want, but the network will continue to process transactions through the P2P system. 
It is this process that will make regulation irrelevant. Today just the Bitcoin network itself is decentralized, but more and more services will follow the same path. For example OpenBazaar. These decentralized services can not be regulated, the OP and his feudal lords will be irrelevant as Vibr8gKiwi points out.

The most interesting takeaway IMHO is the regulations do NOT address Bitcoin itself, but only 3rd party entities that interact with Bitcoin. This demonstrates how just how useful decentralized autonomous corporations (DACs) such as Bitcoin are. 
For example, Ben could have written regulations stating Bitcoin itself is responsible to enforce KYC ID rules in order to process transactions between addresses, and he definitely would have if that was possible. 
But with Bitcoin there is no entity to sue and no entity to implement KYC rules. Thus they were force to create the regulations as proposed, which do not dictate what Bitcoin itself should do. 
This is similar to admitting defeat against Bitcoin. They would have regulated it they could, but cannot and instead regulate centralized entities that interact with Bitcoin.
This demonstrates that DACs are the way forward. OpenBazaar is next, I look forward to more great concepts.

Ending the FED or at least auditing them, stopping the constant bailing out of big banks and holding individuals responsible is not the platform of the Occupy movement. These are positions of horrible, hateful, evil libertarian right-winger teabagging knuckle draggers. 
At least this is what everyone who claims to be a part of the Occupy movement has told me. And know a lot out here in the bay area. 
The ONLY commonality I've heard by Occupy supporters here in CA are: 1) a love big government solutions to every issue and 2) an passionate hatred and vilification of everyone not a liberal progressive (often in extremely racial terms heaping extreme hate on "fly over" middle America)
Sadly that has been my experience and interaction with the movement.

Legal Tender means that entities are REQUIRED BY LAW to accept the currency or notes as payment for debts and services.
This means that if I owe you (or a bank or anything else) $100 dollars, and I decide to pay off that debt by giving you a $100 dollar bill, that you are required by law to accept that dollar bill as payment for that debt. That is all legal tender means.

Once a given system becomes widely adopted, network effects tend to dominate unless there is an overwhelming need to change. Since bitcoin can be modified if most users strongly need a new attribute, the chances of an alt replacing it are very low.

I think most people agree with this need. The disagreement comes in the treechain implementation. 
Alt coins represent a very useful method to explore new modifications. Take zerocoin as an example, lets say it finally launches, represents a significant new advancement, proves itself in the wild and starts to act as a real contender to bitcoin. The response by the bitcoin community would most likely be to finally adopt zerocoin behavior due to pressing need. 
The end result is the same, but the path to get there is different from treechains. Most people I've seen who disagree with treechains, do not disagree with your stated intentions but do disagree with the implementation. But the only arguments I've seen for treechains focus on the intention, for which there are multiple other options...

To be fair though, Iceland was the one and only country that said f-you to the foreign banks and did not implement a government / tax-payer lead bailout.
Iceland was the one country in the financial crisis that let the banks fail and placed blame where it rightfully belongs, on the bankers. Many were convicted in court. 
As a result, Iceland went through a few hard years but is now coming out stronger.
Compare this to Greece or Ireland, where there were massive bank bailouts which lessened the short term pain, but now is suffocating the people. 
The reason Iceland has some controls is to retain some capital since the global banking cartel is still looking to extraxt their blood from Iceland. 
TL;DR Iceland is the only country that did the right thing and did not bail out their banks. Foreign currency controls is an artifact of that. Overall, Iceland doing the right thing. I would move there if they would allow me to.

If you ask some newer bitcoin adopters who want to use it as a method to get rich and create a new establishment, the answer might be no.

If you treat BTC like stocks or commodities, then you can select which purchase to match with a given sale. Stocks let you use First in First out, or Last in First out or any other manually selected matching.
The only rule is an individual purchase can only be matched with a single sale one time, from then on that purchase has been matched and cannot be used again. 
The IRS form gains/loses form provides fields to enter the purchase date, price, quantity and fees. It is your responsibility to make sure you keep track accurately
This is why keeping accurate records of all purchases and sales is very important. It does not matter if you purchase from coinbase or a person on the street as long as you keep good records. If you file gains/loses appropiately and keep your records, then you should be fine through any audit.

Every single absurd/massive program in the US today started small and reasonable, but then grew and grew over time. Bitlicense is no different.

Bingo, it is ridiculous how financial experts talk about one currency being "strong" against another one, when in reality they are all fiat currencies and all drop in value continuously over time. The fact that some go down faster than others does not change the fact that they all all falling. But instead we educate the public the opposite. 
The dollar has fallen to roughly 1/60 it's former value against gold since FDR's order. The fact that the Yen has fallen to 1/(60*117) it's former value does not mean that the dollar is strong despite that is how it is presented.

I think Ben did the community a favor by making the rules so onerous to comply with. He effectively made the regulations next to impossible for most firms to comply with, which in turn forces most firms to take the "ignore" option.
If he started with difficult but reasonable rules, then many firms would have felt the need to at least try to comply with and obtain BitLicenses initially. Then after these firms were captured by having BitLicenses, he could have added more and more onerous regulations. But he stupidly started with something that the vast majority of bitcoin firms cannot comply with at the start. 
In the end these regulations will very publicly demonstrate the true power of Bitcoin, which is the ability to "walk away" from the current system and exit.

Bear Stearns showed just how bad the corruption goes. 
Every TBTF financial firm is 100% dependent on the FED backstopping them.  When the FED stated they would no longer support Bear and would leave Bear to market forces only, it took less than 24 hours for the bank run to complete. 24 hours. If that doesn't show how fake the banking industry is I don't know what does.
What is even more perverse, is the FED insiders were able to pick which institution to allow to fail. Out of the 5 IBs Bear was always viewed as the upstart, and most of the revolving door IB &lt;-&gt; SEC/FED back and forth was with Goldman. *The FED simply picked the IB the least politically connected to fail.* In better times this would have started a revolution.

One of 2 things will happen long-term, either:
1) The blockchain and miners evolve to more easily support many high volume micro-transactions. The effect will be the cost to miners of managing micro-transaction will be lowered, and this will be passed on in the form of lower fees. 
2) The blockchain and miners are not able to easily handled large volumes of micro-transactions. The effect will be fees will be structured to discourage micro-transactions. In this scenario micro-transactions are pushed to off-blockchain payment networks which would be developed. 
Either path will work out OK. It just depends on which path people develop and the free market goes.

There has been quite a bit of speculation Mt.Gox lost access to their private cold wallet keys, either due to government's taking physical possession for an investigation (such as keys stored in a safe deposit box) or a serious mistake resulting in keys being lost. 
The following makes me strongly believe this is the case and MtGox for some reason does not have access to the private keys they need. "6 physical locations" sounds rather complicated and something probably went wrong with their method. 
Q8. Why doesn’t Gox prove they are solvent by transferring a large quantity of BTC between two internal wallets like Mark previously did. Then we can all check it out on the blockchain and be reassured?
• The overwhelming majority of BTC are held in cold storage. Logistically and legally in would be difficult to replicate the transfer “trick” Mark previously employed at Gox to prove their solvency.
Q9. Try me, how hard is it, what exactly is involved?
• Obviously I can’t go into too much detail for security reasons, but it would involve physically obtaining them from 6 or more locations.

To be fair if you understood the state of switching technology in the 1800s that usage makes a lot of sense. Telephones were only direct phone to phone connections for a long time. 
Even well into the 1900s you had to call an operator who would manually switch/connect you by physically plugging and unplugging wires. It required an army of human telephone operators to make a network somewhat functional. 
Electronics has automated all of this to such an extent that we just take it all for granted today, but in the 1800s there were real limits on phone technology and it took generations to get it to where we are today.

"The biggest issue for most bitcoin users is determining their basis. Because bitcoins are fungible, you run into the problem of tracing the cost of each bitcoin you hold. You cannot just arbitrarily choose your basis. The IRS will permit you to use the FIFO method (First in, First out). Any other method such as LIFO or Average Cost Basis is not advisable, particularly now that we know foreign currency rules do not apply."
Why is this true?
I use schwab for my broker and for stock transactions they allow you to match a given sale with any specific purchase. This includes using FIFO, LIFO, or any other method that allows you to tax optimize.
The one and only rule for stocks is that you can only match a specific purchase once, and once that purchase is matched it is "used up" so to speak. 
Using FIFO is just an easy method of ensuring that you only match purchases a single time.
But if you keep clear &amp; verifiable records I do not understand why Bitcoin transactions would be locked into FIFO only.

Governments simply exist to appropriate money/work/wealth from everyone within their reach.
Uncle Sam is selling these BTC to take in money, because Uncle Sam sells anything and everything they get their hands on to raise funds and rewards themselves.
If the government had any sense, it would transfer both these 30K BTC and the DPR coins to the FED to protect against the remote chance bitcoin takes off. Then the FED would at least have a large percentage of coins to back dollars with. 
But that would require the government to have both sense and a conservative attitude towards protecting wealth. Governments hav neither and assume they can appropriate wealth on demand whenever needed.

What you described is not the normal use case.
The vast majority (over 99%) of walk up to a counter transactions will involve people who already had their bitcoins in a wallet. 
Even in your situation I'd say zero confirmation transaction is not a problem. In your example, you would take time to explain to her about bitcoin. You'd help her set up a wallet, transfer her some coins, then show her how they show up immediately (few seconds), explain to her more about the blockchain and confirmations, while that's happening most likely your transaction will confirm. Then go to the counter. 
If you wanted to just immediately go to the counter, then in that off non-standard situation, yes the merchant should ask you to wait for a confirmation. But I think that is very rare.

No, we should resist the statists from the beginning through individual choice and market forces. 
Going forward there will be 2 types of online bitcoin services: 1) services that get NY BitLicenses and follow the proposed regulations, and 2) services which ignore NY regulations by either denying NY residents access or operating outside of US jurisdiction. 
I will only work with services that take option  If most of the community does so as well it will effectively render the regulations meaningless and encourage future investment to take a similar path.

The drawback is you have to presetup your account and get verified to the higher limits.

IMHO the  potential issue for Bitcoin has always been the potential to create an infinite number of replicas, which defeats the scarcity of coins. 
The argument against this has always been that network effects would always force a single (or small number) of winning (i.e. widely adopted) block chains, and the infinite replicas would fade into obscurity. 
Glad to see this is happening, the alternative is both bitcoin and alts have major long term issues.

We will see if Circle eventually follows up on this statement or not, hopefully they are being serious here.
If BitLicense's are implemented in any manner remotely close to the original proposal, then I think we are going to need a global list that divides services into those who chose to follow NYDFS and those who chose to block NY residents and reject the proposed regulation. 
This would better enable end users (us) to make our political views known in the market by enabling us to shift our business to services that took whichever path we most agreed with. For example if Coinbase decided to get a BitLicense I would transfer my business elsewhere. 
In this manner we could support businesses that match our views on the matter and grow the ecosystem in the direction the community wants (again this could be either way). The best outcome IMHO would be if services who rejected BitLicenses grew the fastest in the market, which would demonstrate the ability of the bitcoin ecosystem to route around bad policy, hopefully encouraging better policy in the future.

Unless it is done at a federal level, some states will see very clear advantages to taking the opposite approach and enabling/supporting bitcoin. Think about it, if 40 states take the NY approach, then there are clear business opportunities for a holdout state to take a supportive approach.
Personally I'm curious which state, CA or TX, will take a support Bitcoin approach. They are at opposite ends of the false blue/red divide, but both see themselves as leaders in freedom (just different focuses).

I remember one of the early analyses of BTC concentration had Gavin listed as one of the main BTC owners. It's been a couple of years since I saw this, but I remember he was listed at 25,000 BTC which is very reasonable considering how early and involved he was. 
Gavin having a ton of BTC is fine, good for him for doing so. But my point is it's not just the foundation money he receives but he also has a lot of early adopter coins. So Gavin's been well compensated, I'd save your donations for something else with fewer than 10K BTC....

This is one of the most obscene elements to the judicial system today.
Jury nullification is a right of the people as a safe guard against laws without public support. The supreme court has ruled on this and the founding fathers made their views clear.
Despite jury nullification being a right of the people, the courts and judges have ruled:
1) The defense is not allowed to inform a jury of this right.
2) The prosecution and judge can misinform and tell jurors nullification is illegal (and they commonly do)
3) Will kick off any juror who says they might use nullification
4) Will kick off any juror who other jurors say they believe is using nullification (so any jury can kick off a "not guilty" holdout by falsely saying that juror is using nullification)
5) Bar the public for informing a jury about nullification (this is why the Ross effort has to take place over a few weeks, it is to protect the pamphlet distributors because otherwise they could be arrested for targeting the Ross case).
Fundamental rights are only rights if they are known by the public, if education of a right is denied by a government then the right ceases to exist. It is criminal what the courts have done here

There are two types of zero conf tx's and each have different risk characteristics. 
The first are transactions that have not yet been confirmed in the block chain but who's inputs have all been confirmed. These are relatively safe and most likely will be confirmed at some point. The risk is if a block comes out with one of the tx's inputs spent elsewhere, to do this requires some level of collusion with a miner if your tx was already broadcast to the p2p network.
The second type of zero conf tx are transactions with inputs that have themselves not been confirmed yet, these are much more risky. They also should be rare, if you receive one it should be flagged as a risk. POS payment processors should ideally be able to distinguish between the two.

Spats summarized my thinking well. To shutdown bitcoin the US would have to be so heavy handed that it would it would not be viewed as legitimate in the eyes of many, most likely illegal in the courts and met with significant resistance. For example the government could create a chinese internet firewall, but would that hold? No.
Regarding FDR's gold order, couple points:
1) If you read history the order was very widely ignored, an exceptionally small number of people followed it and turned in their gold. Since there was no registry of gold ownership it was impossible to force a handover. (This is why 2A advocates fight registration lists). In your example the government DID face almost absolute resistance...
2) FDR's rational for the legality of the order was private property was not being confiscated, people were suppose to turn over their gold for an equivalent value of dollars. The fact that he immediately devalued dollars to gold afterwards by 40% just made it clear to never trust the government with money and that the 99.99% of the citizenry who ignored the order were right to do so.
@_date: 2014-07-02 20:09:34
Exactly, sharing ownership of private keys should be viewed that same way as lending bitcoins to a 3rd party person/entity.
For example, if someone gives coinbase gold coins to store then they are exposed to counterparty risk and what you essentially have is a loan. Under a traditional monetary system that person would receive interest to compensate for that risk. 
People had this attitude when banks were considered risky because there was no bailout entity. People have forgotten this under 4 generations with the FED who is able to bail-out any and all mistakes. But bitcoin is a traditional monetary system, if they go bust no one is in a position to create new bitcoins to make you whole. 
People using MtGox learned this, I trust coinbase infinitely more, but still not enough to share ownership of bitcoins without any compensation for that risk.

This is incorrect, and represents the core problem with the official "too big to fail" policy. 
JP Morgan CAN print money. It does so by leveraging itself to the hilt during good times. Then when a downturn happens, instead of taking write offs to equity (and more importantly credit) holders, JP Morgan goes to the FED who provides "liquidity" through various mechanisms and yes prints money out of air to "save" JP Morgan.
That is why the entire regulatory system with TBTF is such a scam. It is so well setup that most people do not see it.

Those who fractionalize and do not have enough BTC to cover obligations will experience runs that cause complete customer wipe outs. In the end only firms who customers strongly TRUST to NOT fractionalize will receive customer funds and stay in business.

Never ever sell anything more than a few hundred without a bank check, it takes the buyer less time to get one then driving to pickup the item itself, so there is no excuse.

Completely agree. I sometimes beat myself up for only investing a very small amount at the $2 range, and waiting till it reached $200 before buying a bunch. But the reality is bitcoin became a lot less risky only after the momentum in new services and VC gained traction, this was not the case in 2011 when we only had MtGox and SilkRoad. Now it is flourishing. 
IMHO the best thing to watch is global VC investment in the sector, if that keeps growing so will BTC, if that stalls or stops (they move one to something else) BTC will stall also.

Actually Gibbs is right. 
Litecoin was designed to enable GPU mining by the developer, it was never intended to be GPU resistant. That was just marketing spin.
The scrypt algorithm is most definitely GPU and ASIC resistant. The key to making it resistant is to configure the parameters properly, primarily the memory size required.
Litecoin selected parameters that were not just non-GPU-resistant, but selected parameters that were **optimized for modern GPUs**. Specifically the memory parameter is configured to fully utilize and fit into a GPU core cache structure. This enables each GPU core to run at full speed. 
This is why Litecoin was always a scam IMHO.
If you change the Litecoin parameters to increase the per thread memory requirement to lets say 8GB, then it would be very GPU and ASIC resistant.

2) That they should be hated and scorned, no humans should be hated for their ethnicity, age, sex
As a side note, it's rather ridiculous to attack "white" as a monolithic group because the definition of white has kept changing and expanding.

"Bitcoin is a way of making transactions that bypasses the banking sector, and according to the authors of the report, it makes it easier to launder money and cover up illegal activity. 
In order to reduce these risks, **the report proposes to limit virtual currency flows** and the **anonymous status of users**. It also wants a **cap on the amounts used** to carry out electronic payments."
To be honest, I've been looking forward to a major EU country attempt to significantly regulate and curtail Bitcoin, primarily because doing so would demonstrate just how resilient the network is. 
If France went through with this 3 things would happen.
1) Bitcoin would continue without the network noticing or caring. Transactions would continue and the global hashrate would continue to grow. There would be no one for the French authorities to sue or prosecute.
2) France would itself be the only entity hurt from the regulation because: a) Bitcoin transactions would simply move to the black market causing France to miss tax revenue, which the IRS is collecting and b) France's technology sector would be stifled and damaged. 
It would be interesting to see if this served as a lesson to other countries or not.

I think the correct way to look at it is Bitcoin was designed to be censorship resistant. 
Governments can try to limit access to bitcoin through regulation, IP filtering, banning usage, etc. However the nature of the protocol means that as long as you can find a method to tunnel information over the internet, you can access the network. 
In a sense, a government's ability to shut down Bitcoin is the same as a government's ability to shut down free speech. It is practically impossible to fully censor speech, and similarly it will be practically impossible to fully censor bitcoin.

Yes both are similar situations from a purchasing power perspective. 
But in a fiat inflationary environment people are encouraged to spend and not save for the future. This creates dependency, reduces self reliance and encourages expansion of government services.
While in the sound money deflationary environment people are encouraged to save and build capital because that capital will be worth more later in their life. This creates self reliance and freedom to operate without a parental government in your life.

Kelly, it really only depends on the amount of time you are willing to put in and the speed you require.
Let's say you have an address with 0.2BTC that contains many small inputs (i.e. your typical middlecoin mining address). You could:
1) Send the whole amount for a reasonable one time fee of lets say 0.0005BTC (since it is a large transaction), and have 0.1995 arrive within a few blocks. Or
2) Manually send multiple transactions of just one or a few inputs each for zero fee (assuming you've waited a month to gain priority). These transactions will take many hours to confirm and some may not and need to be checked and resent in a few days. In the end the full 0.2BTC are sent, but it took a bit of management on your part.
So again it comes down to time, both how much manual effort you are willing to spend to save a few pennies and how fast you need the coins.

"and store collateral of the Bitcoins in the form of USD in a bond."
This effectively kills the business model of any web wallet service. 
If bitcoin rises in price by 10x, then wallet services need to raise 10x more money to act as USD collateral? If so, that is simply not possible or realistic. 
It also defeats the purpose of bitcoin as an alternative currency to FED fiat. Under this regulation, increased adoption/valuation of bitcoin directly results in a 1-to-1 increase in demand for USD through the collateral requirement. That is insane.

What you are describing is not realistic however, and that is what Andreas is getting at.
Yes, with a full coordinated and open attack the US gov could effectively knock down bitcoin, as you said this includes a combined legal and technical attack. I still think it is questionable whether or not they could completely take bitcoin offline, but at least significantly disrupt it to the point that it becomes difficult or useless. 
However, the catch-22 is the US claims to be a free country where individuals have the right to self determination and the right to do as they choose. This is why your scenario can not happen. Whether you believe the US is a closed fascist country with the illusion of freedom or an open country, in both cases the illusion of freedom is required to maintain the consent of the governed. What you are describing is well beyond the boundaries any government that claims to be open and free can operate beyond. 
It's also not even clear SCOTUS would agree, there also already today would be disagreement within the house and senate. This makes 2 out of 3 branches which seem unlikely to back a full scale government attack. (You can argue that the 4 branch of regulatory bodies could do it outside of the legislative process, but even they require agreement to operate)
Don't get me wrong, I believe the Snowden docs have shown just how undemocratic and controlling the US government has become, but it has to be done behind the scenes, not in the openly controlling manner you described. And since this is the only way the US government could effectively stop bitcoin, it means in the end they they can not.

It's illegal in every state. 
The 3% card fee is the fee that the business pays for offering/using the credit card service. They could ask for cash only if they wanted and not pay the CC fee, but would lose customers. If someone doesn't tip, who pays the CC fee? The business. It would be absurd for the business to force the staff to pay the fee out of their pocket. 
Take DerBitcoiner's advice and contact the Labor Dept, that is seriously illegal. 
Once you file a complaint, I also don't think they can fire you in response without even worse problems. 
Edit: OK, maybe not. I thought you meant that the business makes you pay the full 3% CC's charge out of your tips (so for example %15 tip - 3% = 12% tip). But below you said that they only charge 3% on the tip (so for example %15 tip - %3 of that 15% = %14.55 tip). That seems reasonable since the CC is taking that amount for the tip portion. So I take back my comments above.

The problem is what is defined as "unreadable". An encrypted wallet file, which we _all_ use makes our private keys unreadable. Encrypted wallets are a concept outside of the core bitcoin P2P network, but they are required by individuals to effectively use the P2P network. 
Given the sliding slope of expanded government powers over the past several decades, it's completely reasonable to expect this would include encrypted private keys hidden unreadable from the government, and regulators in the future could declare all private keys must either be made accessible to some centralized list or remain in an unencrypted state. 
That does not break bitcoin, but forces usage to go into the black market, which negatively effects it.

Anyone could do the same with just about anything.
I remember last year there was a news story about a guy who's wife filed for divorce, and he converted their life savings into gold coins (around $500K worth) and then claimed he tossed them in the garbage. It's possible he kept the gold, but also possible he really did throw it away (people getting divorced to crazy things)
He could have done this with anything, diamonds, artwork, baseball cards, etc. So bitcoin is not unique here.
At least with bitcoin the other spouse could monitor the "lost" addresses and have a chance to prove he has them if he tried to use them in the future. Gold coins, good luck.
The FT's argument here is silly, bitcoin is actually better from this perspective. Not that it matters anyway.

This needs to be built into the instructions of every POS application, clearly instructing merchants what to expect and how to handle instant transactions.
The one issue are transactions that themselves include zero confirmation inputs, here there is a legitimate risk. 
A POS application should do the following:
1) If an incoming transaction contains NO zero confirmation inputs, immediately mark the transaction as complete for everyday use amounts such as buying coffee. If the amount is above a certain limit (such as selling a car) then wait for the standard 6 confirmations, this is fine for large amounts.
2) If an incoming transaction contains zero confirmation inputs, mark the transaction as "at risk" and tell the merchant they should wait for 1 confirmation. Your average user should never spend a zero confirmation input, so if someone tries to buy coffee with one they are probably trying something.

The guidelines make complete sense, and reflect how I thought people should have calculated taxes for a while. 
Bitcoin is property like any other property. If you sell it for more than you acquired it for, the IRS treats the increase as a capital gain and you pay taxes on that. If you earn income you pay taxes on that. *This is the same as any other form of property.*
Currency is the primary "unit of account" specified by a host country. Since all transactions are valued in that "unit of account" there is no tax event when using a country's home currency, since by definition the value is the same against the base unit of account.
The worse outcome would have been if the IRS labeled bitcoin a "foreign currency". If this was the case then any **unrealized**  gain would be taxable at the end of the year. This would have meant that everyone holding bitcoins would have had to value them on Dec 31 2013 and pay taxes on that gain. And do this every year. This would destroy the concept of cold storage.
Treating bitcoin and "property" and not "foreign currency" is vastly vastly more simple and logical. It also allows it to be used as a store of value, since there is no tax event from holding a long time.

The fact is Litecoin was advertised as GPU resistant, which implies ASIC impossible. Looking at what happened this was a massive failure. 
There are two possible reasons, 1) it was done on purpose, for this I admit there is little evidence, or 2) it was done by accident with poor setup/configuration. 
Even if it was done by accident, anyone which knowledge of hardware design could see how the litecoin parameters specified too little memory to be effective. The core concept of scrypt is to force a single computational thread to scan a large amount of memory, in doing so you create a bandwidth issue which forces serial processing of the array. The key is the array has to be large enough to not "fit" into a local hardwired engine. 
All the developer had to do was run his scrypt configuration by any h/w designer (they have many at google btw) and be told to change the parameters to require much more memory.
Litecoin is stock Bitcoin with only *two* changes, these are: 1) A faster block confirmation time and 2) a different mining algorithm.
Considering the developer worked at google, and they have *a lot of hardware devs at google*, the fact is it would have been **trivial for the developer to double check** the only real change he was making. 
This is why I don't think the accusations are scammy at all, the developer's only change to Bitcoin was implemented in a very clearly massively incorrect manner while he had easy access to many people who he should have consulted and who would have corrected it.

"To me ...  it is neither; it’s just another currency. Bitcoin is a crypto currency, or virtual currency. It is created and controlled by cryptography rather than by a central bank, a distinction that many find hard to grasp. In reality, for those involved in the market, this is a distinction without a difference. **Critics claim that the lack of central back backing makes Bitcoins essentially worthless, but that shows a lack of understanding about how currencies, and currency markets, work.**
**No currency has a value beyond that which users place on it. Ever since most countries followed the lead of the U.S. in 1971 and abandoned the gold standard, currencies have had value simply because they have value.** It is the willingness of others to accept them in exchange for goods and services that makes them work."

The DOJ and FBI will return the Bitcoin they hold to their rightful owners in the same manner that the FED is returning Germany's physical gold. 
In Germany's case they are holding gold in the FED's New York vault under an "on demand" account, which means that Germany has the legal right to demand immediate access to their physical gold. However the FED has negotiated an 8 year transfer plan for less than 50% of Germany's holdings and returned less than 1% in the first year.

A bitcoin is protected by two forms of cryptography, the ecdsa algorithm and a hash of the public key.
To crack a bitcoin you need to break both forms of cryptography, breaking either one on its own is very hard, breaking both at the same time is exponentially harder.
When you use a bitcoin you have to expose the public key, this means you are now only protected by one form of cryptography, the ecdsa algorithm.

The reason for the cash reporting rules are to prevent smuggling money across boarders. But with a bank card, as you pointed out, governments have other mechanisms to track money transfers, and so if you carry a card on you with access to $100K there is no reporting requirement. 
A bitcoin wallet is the same situation, it is like a card in that it gives you access to an account with funds. But same as with a card, governments have other mechanisms to track withdraws.

gnaritas, transferring money from borrowers to lenders has little to do with poor to rich. 
Governments don't like deflation because it punishes borrowers, primarily borrowers who overextended themselves too far. This does several things: 
1) It limits the ability of governments to use debt to finance spending, 
2) It causes people to be more fiscally prudent and not spend above their means, governments hate that because it prevents artificial wealth effects and 
3) It bankrupts people who overextend, preventing them from being able to overextend again and again.
But each of these is a good thing:
1) Limiting a government from financing through debt creation, forces governments to only spend what a populace is willing to pay in taxes and prevents a government from saddling unborn children into debt servitude. 
2) Encouraging people to not spend above their means and save, builds a nation's capital base for future investment and helps individuals achieve safety and independence
3) Bankrupting people/entities who over extend punishes entities/people who squandered money and made poor choices specifically so that they are not in a position to waste resources again, while at the same time rewarding those who are fiscally prudent.

Thank you for all of your great work.
What are your thoughts on adding some form of a UXTO checkpoint data structure to blocks? 
It seems this would greatly reduce the download pressure caused by new nodes joining the network or node catch-up, since at a maximum a node only needs to download headers and the UXTO dataset to function as a full peer on the network. This is significantly less data than downloading the current blockchain, and the difference will only grow over time. (Nodes catching up from a past point won't even require a full UXTO list but a diff from their last checkpoint)

The idea that the FED's primary role is to restrict monetary expansion is laughable.
The reason for the FED restrictions (which BTW keep being relaxed, in the 80s banks needed 20% capital, today &lt;10%) is the FED created a false market by being the lender of last resort. Any time a bank has a capital shortage they will provide unlimited liquidity through various mechanisms (swaps, repos, windows, etc). 
The restrictions only exist because without them banks would lend unlimited amounts since the FED is there to bailout any issues with the printing press.
In a free market these restrictions are not necessary because banks are naturally restricted in lending and if they go too far will experience a run. Back in the 1800s when there were no official restrictions like today, yet banks typically kept 50% capital ratios, today it is &lt;10%... That there shows what is more effective at regulating activities, it is the free market.

A bit off-topic, does Armory plan to support importing compressed private keys at some point? i.e. private keys starting with a K or L, instead of a 5.
A couple months ago I started to transfer funds from bitcoin-qt into Armory. I did this by importing a private key into a temp wallet in Armory and then sending from within Armory to a standard Armory deterministic wallet. This worked fine for my smaller qt wallets that all used standard private keys.
But then my main cold storage wallet (which I've never sent from) only dumped out these strange K and L keys which Armory rejected as invalid. I almost had a heart attack thinking the qt wallet was broken and it took me over an hour to convince myself the wallet was fine and still spendable. Qt was fine, but Armory's rejection really freaked me out.

Do we really need zerocoin to be on the main chain at all anyway? 
Zerocoin's basic function is to anonymize coins, but that is not need for standard transactions, but instead is just needed when demanded.
Couldn't zerocoin function as some form of an altcoin market where people quickly trade into zerocoin and then back out? Obviously you would want the exchange to be anonymous as well, maybe ripple would help here?
Simple point is zerocoin has it's purpose, but that does not necessarily mean integration with the main chain.

Then Chuck came back and stopped all that nonsense, so I stuck around and have been very happy. Lived overseas for awhile and they helped cover international wires and other associated costs. 
The best program Schwab had was their 2% cash back visa card. Every month you got 2% of purchases deposited into your account, no other credit card came close. (Schwab ended up having to close the program because most of their customers are those who pay balances off each month and never pay fees. Apparently the program cost them millions per month)

Can someone explain what mechanism the ETF will use to track the BTC price? My (limited) understanding is they could either implement this similar to a closed end fund or an open fund. 
In the gold world PHYS (Sprott Physical Gold Fund) is an example of a closed fund. PHYS holds a fixed amount of gold and the fund's market price can freely float over or under gold's actual value, and at times diverges from gold's price by several percent. The only mechanism to keep PHYS tracking gold is people shouldn't want to pay a premium and so demand for the PHYS fund should lower if the premium gets too high. 
Conversely in the gold world GLD is an example of an open fund. Here there are market makers who can transact with the fund itself to buy or sell new units of gold futures into GLD. For example if GLD goes above gold's spot price, market makers would sell blocks of gold futures into the fund. In this manner the asset supply of GLD goes up and down with market demand and GLD ends up closely tracking gold's real price. 
So how will the twin's ETF work? Will they use either of these two mechanisms, or something else?

The fork definitely was a bigger issue because it temporarily broke the key concept of bitcoin, which is achieving network consensus through the blockchain.

MtGox failing and people losing their money is Bitcoin working as it should.

@_date: 2014-03-05 21:15:24
The fact that people lost such large sums, although sad, is a feature of bitcoin and the ideals of a free market. 
In our current monetary system, both customers and creditors are saved by a central bank that bails out incompetent entities. The issue with this is: 1) prudent savers are punished by having their money be devalued and 2) the market no longer has an incentive to identify and stop incompetent entities before they blow up. In fact it does the opposite and encourages bad behavior across the board.
But in bitcoin there is no bailout entity. Because of this customers and creditors have to be very careful about counter party risk. The end effect is individuals through the free market police themselves and take measures to ensure funds are lot lost in this manner, or at least to minimize their loses. 
Although sad, the long-term effect of people losing money like this with MtGox will be to make the bitcoin ecosystem stronger through the free market taking corrective action (instead of regulators). It is a long-term good thing that people are re-waking up to counter party risk and the need to protect themselves.

You can't have a fractional reserve system without a bailout entity who can provide liquidity on demand. That's how the dollar system works. Bank fractionalize the dollar, then if too many people withdraw assets, the FED will swap collateral for dollars. The FED needs the ability to create dollars on demand to do this.
In bitcoin there is no bailout entity who can create unlimited bitcoins to support firms that fractionally lend bitcoins. Any firm that try's this will experience a run.

An advantage of ebay is they offer buyers a high level of protection. If the product is not as described or not delivered, ebay enables chargebacks that protect you the buyer. 
This is the reason why there are so many buyers on ebay. Sellers (which I am one of) complain about the fee structure, but part of these fees go towards services that protect buyers, which in turn creates the large market which is why I sell on ebay.
In OpenBazaar, how does buyer protection work or what options exist? Seller rating is one level, but it is more limited than the current mainstream offerings.

Mining based security is a factor of the amount of time that has passed, not the amount of confirmations. 
6 10-min blocks is equal to 60 1-min blocks in terms of the likelihood a 49.9% attacker could reverse the transaction with an alternative transaction.

Exactly, this is a major issue for any firm that sells across boarders. In just about every industry different prices are charged to different customers, in many cases the differences are large. 
It is very difficult for consumers to see these difference because they are in different currencies. 
But with bitcoin, the differences become obvious. This is a problem for many firms and will hinder bitcoin adoption.
This is was on of the major selling points of the Euro that was sold to the public. Before the Euro prices for items vastly differed from country to country. i.e. $10,000 for a car in Germany but $20,000 for the same car in Italy. With the Euro the theory was these differences would be obvious to consumers, who would respond to bring prices in line.
Bitcoin being a global currency does this at a global level. There are many interests against this aspect...

Could you share the equation that calculates this? Curious where this comes from.
@_date: 2014-03-25 20:19:24
It means if you mine $100 in BTC you have to report $100 in income at the end of the year. Of course you can deduct expenses as you would for any other source of income, such as electricity and equipment (at whatever level of depreciation is reasonable).
It seems to me the complicated part is keeping track of "daily" mining income. Lets say you mine and earn 0.01 BTC every day. That means to calculate your income you would have to convert each of those individual 0.01BTC amounts into dollar equivalents for each day, and that becomes your income. Those amounts are then used as your capital basis amount for when you later sell.

On the other hand 11,000 TPS would result in ~1500x higher transaction fees per block. 
That works out to an additional **~145 BTC per block in fees**, for 170 BTC total - 145 fees plus 25 block reward. (Average fees per day today 14 BTC * 1500 increase / 
144 blocks per day)
At that level of payout the block reward becomes meaningless and miners earn a high enough reward from fees to invest in large scale systems capable of handling the transaction load. 
Have miners set this up yet? No because they don't have to yet. But Bitcoin's financial structure is designed to handle 11,000 TPS and because of that the technical challenges will be worked out when needed.

Changing (or removing) the blocksize limit better aligns Bitcoin to Satoshi's vision. He said it was temporary and should be removed at some point. He understood the effects and that was still the Bitcoin he wanted to create.

Unfortunately I was having a lunch meeting where it would have been difficult to stop and go over to defend him, but I probably just saved myself some ridicule. 
But I've learned that these are the people who will complain about how "unfair" it is that they were not early adopters. 
Being an early adopter requires and open mind that is curious about new ideas, both good and bad, because bitcoin sounds like a stupid bad idea to everyone of us the first time we hear about it. But curious people at least take time to ask questions and learn, that is how people become early adopters.

Bitcoin moves responsibility from institutions and to individuals by transferring the loss for mistakes to those who make them. That is a core property of the blockchain.

Exactly. This and the right scripts can take care of the holes Vasyrr mentions. USB stick gets pulled as you put your hands up or are tackled, and the host computer immediately goes to work zeroing out the memory automatically (which is not hard to set in motion). 
Also (to Vasyrr) even if zeroing scripts didn't execute for some reason and they were  able to freeze the DRAM for dumping, only the data Ross accesses at the time would be in memory. The alias file for example probably wouldn't even be in memory and only exist on the encrypted USB drive. At worse it seriously reduces the amount of evidence available. 
Again, there were many precautions Ross could have taken, and he took none.

Still can not believe he went to a public space (let alone a library where LEOs could sneak up on him) and had ALL this information in an unencrypted and accessible state. 
This is exactly what TrueCrypt USB volumes or similar mechanisms are for. Put your VM and all data on the USB drive. Then all you need to do to protect the data is to pull the USB stick out of the slot, the VM on the host crashes and loses the data, and most importantly ALL the other files on the USB volume are protected. 
If Ross was running this for 2 years he knew the effort going on to find him, cannot believe he took such few precautions.

You can down vote me, but that is the purpose of a jury system.
The jury system forces the government to have strong majority support to convict and imprison someone. If 25% of the population disagree with what is happening, that is enough to decide not-guilty and set a person free.
You seriously are asking for a horrific example with Germany. How about the gassing of 6M jews you racist shit.

The jury system is a buffer between the government and the general public. 
It means that the general public always get their say in what is right or wrong, and that ALL government convictions require the CONSENT of the general population. 
It does not always work perfectly, but is infinitely better than systems where a government has final say in all matters related to conviction. Germany's horrific track record proves this.

"I suppose concern is the wrong word but bitcoin wants to be a currency. Like you say, gold is a store of value."
It depends on what your view of a currency is. Is it something with paper fiat properties or gold properties?
Personally I think bitcoin is behaving exactly like a true currency right now, and that is a good thing.
IMHO a true currency is a gold or silver standard. When we were under that gold was both a currency and a store of value. Gold was both horded to a degree (i.e. gold stored in private vaults) and some gold regularly transacted (gold backed certificates/notes).  A similar percentage of gold was "horded" as bitcoin is horded today, so I do see bitcoin has behaving exactly like a currency.

This is standard boilerplate legal stuff, every investment fund includes a long list of clauses like these.
And they are required by the SEC, funds have to spell out in detail every single possible risk to investors that they can imagine. COIN losing their bitcoin is a possible risk, so they have to inform investors and tell them if it happens there is no recourse.

Exactly, case in point the income tax amendment was originally sold to poor rural farmers as a way to tax the rich. Today the rich pay little in income taxes (buffet pays &lt;15%) while the middle class is crushed with greater than 50% tax rates (aggregate). Its horrible.
@_date: 2015-01-16 19:18:42
Geez those who passionately hate libertarians love to misconstrue the truth. 
The fact is no one ever paid close to 70% in taxes. There were significant deductions back then that brought the rates down. Also $200K back then is closer to $1M today in annual income. As part of the tax rate reduction, these deductions were eliminated. 
In 1970 a person making $200K could easily pay (70% - significant deductions), because they had the equivalent of a $1M+ in annual income in today's dollars.
In 2015 a person making $200K in many parts of the country could never pay (70% + higher state taxes (10% CA) + higher sales taxes (10% CA) + higher SS taxes (~14%) + higher medicade taxes (~3%)). 
You start to add that up and an upper middle class income is reduced to the poverty level. 
You want to bring back 70% tax rates, great I'm all for it. But it starts at $2M in annual income so it only hits Buffet and Gates, and does not start at $200K so it hits doctors, engineers (and today many cops and other public servants)

They can and do bar people and people have been arrested and jailed for specifically targeting jurors in the recent past over jury nullification. 
That said the sidewalk in front of a court house is a public space, and they cannot bar people from handing out leaflets to the general public. If potential jurors walk by and you engage with them the same as everyone else, then you're OK because you are not specifically targeting jurors. 
This is why the current effort for Ross has to take place over many days and also why they are taking steps to target the general public. 
In doing so it is clear that they are not targeting the jurors of a specific case, and are staying on the acceptable side of the current law. 
Which is all nonsense and illegal IMHO opinion. The defense should be able to tell jurors that part of the jury process is to judge both the evidence and the legality of the laws involved, and if they disagree with a law in good conscience they are free to nullify it.

He didn't just break every security rule someone (who was being pursued by the full weight of the US gov) should follow, he broke them and kept complete incriminating evidence on his person, unlocked. 
Practically ALL of the hard evidence against him came from that laptop, without the laptop the rest of the evidence was circumstantial at best. If Ross had: 1) stored nothing of value on the laptop he used regularly and 2) only unlocked his laptop in secure positions, the government would have had a very difficult time getting a clear cut case. Even if they had him in the SF library accessing SilkRoad, Ross could have made the case he was a minor admin, not DPR.

Jury nullification is a right of the people as a safe guard against laws without public support. The supreme court has ruled on this and the founding fathers made their views clear.
Despite jury nullification being a right of the people, the courts and judges have ruled:
1) The defense is not allowed to inform a jury of this right.
2) The prosecution and judge can misinform and tell jurors nullification is illegal (and they commonly do)
3) Will kick off any juror who says they might use nullification
4) Will kick off any juror who other jurors say they believe is using nullification (so any jury can kick off a "not guilty" holdout by falsely saying that juror is using nullification)
5) Bar the public for informing a jury about nullification (this is why the Ross effort has to take place over a few weeks, it is to protect the pamphlet distributors because otherwise they could be arrested for targeting the Ross case).

If the market grows and become more efficient then we'll see these spreads naturally reduce. It's the same with any asset. If you buy gold through the GLD etf you'll pay at most pennies on the spread, but if you buy through an illiquid etf you'll pay a much higher spread.

This was not an instance of Peter discovering some unknown white-hat flaw. 
This was simply using a known security risk (as discussed in Satoshi's white paper 7 years ago). No one has ever said that what Peter did was not possible, just that it is hard to pull off. 
And Peter might just learn before this is done that there are other security vectors besides bitcoin, such as financial fraud laws that carry 30 years with them for what he did.

You can't be a "store of value" without being a "medium of exchange". This is basic monetary theory and what a lot of people miss here. 
This is how gold failed as a store of value. Gold was a store of value for countless generations. But once they created "paper backed gold" (i.e. FED dollars circa 1913), gold stopped being used as a medium of exchange.
Gold having stopped being the medium of exchange in 1913 is what enabled the 1933 default and switch to full fiat backed by nothing. 
The lesson is Bitcoin must be used as a medium of exchange directly by individuals to have value. If Bitcoin requires an abstraction layer between it at the average person. Then in a time of crisis it becomes easy to convince people to accept a 1933 style conversion to a new medium that is inflationary.

The problem with this argument is it means that 1MB blocks are too large since they are causing the node count to decrease, which means that we should in fact REDUCE the 1MB limit. Which of course is absurd.
The node count decreasing has nothing to do with block size and everything to do with the fact that SPV wallets are now available and most people do not need a full node. This BTW is all what Satoshi expected.
If the node count decreases to the point that it becomes an issue for people's connectivity, then a node service market will develop on its own to provide connectivity for a nomial fee.
The free market will take care of the node count issue, the fact many bitcoin devs do not understand this simply shows they don't understand what bitcoin really is.

That is how POW works. The only entities that get a say in the system are miners who produce POW hashes. 
P2P nodes can decide to accept their chain or not, but miners are free to do whatever they want (of course if enough nodes do not accept a chain then it is not worthwhile to produce that chain).
No one gets a say in the system, not core devs, not governments, no one. That is what makes bitcoin decentralized, POW hashes are the only legitimate votes. 
The agruments over "consensus" today show even most core devs do not seem to understand what decentralization or consensus means in Bitcoin land.

The music industry forcing the DMCA on us was unforgivable as it directly worked against well established fair use rights. 
Legal precedent on fair use as part of our first amendment rights was clear and well established for a long time.
Under fair use people who purchased content had a right to copy it for personal backups, fast forward/skip anything they wanted, publicly use, share and copy small segments for use in other wirks , etc.
The music and movie industries hated this, but the courts ruled against them time and again.
Then they created the DMCA to circumvent fair use.
Under the DMCA it became illegal to break encryption, even for fair use reasons. So for example you still have a legal right to make private copies, or share clips, but if you broke the encryption to do so then that act was illegal. And the courts went with this convoluted logic.
So you still had your same fair use rights to do A, B, C and D. BUT if you broke encryption that was illegal.
This essentially boxed our well established first amendment rights behind an encryption box that prevented their access.
To me the music and video industries are terrorists that exploited legal loopholes to destroy our rights. They should never be forgiven for this.

The proposed change enables LN, which will pull transactions off of the main chain. This transfers fees from the main chain to LN operators. 
This completely breaks bitcoin's fee based model, which in turn breaks bitcoin's mining security mechanism. 
LN proponents counter that although the main chain will have limited transactions, those transactions will pay a higher amount. (Some core devs have suggested $1000/transaction, seriously) This is nuts.
Satoshi's model was designed for a high # of transactions each paying a minimal fee. For example if you scale to 1GB/blocks the fees generated by $.01 transactions pays higher than today's 25 block reward. 
This fork (and it is a fork) enable private companies to build mechanisms that pull fees from the main chain. Long term this is the death of bitcoin. 
The fact that everyone sounding this alarm is being censored and deleted here, in no way changes the situation. **Just because you censor people's ideas doesn't make their ideas wrong or make them go away. **
So again, enjoy your path, there are many like me that will never accept blocks with these OP Codes.

To be more accurate you should change the title from 'stolen' to 'claimed'.
Ownership in bitcoin is solely determined by possession of private keys. In this case the address you sent coins to is a shared address because multiple people own it and can access it.
 You sent btc to a jointly owned address because other people held the private key as well. As such they had just as much of a right to the btc as you did. So the coins were not really stolen.

Bitcoin can not survive in the long term without fees, fees from many transactions.
Blockstreams proposal is to pull fees from the main chain based on the false assumption that bitcoin can not scale. 
This is a false assumption because it has not been proven yet. Just because some devs today say it is not possible does not mean someone else will not come up with solutions on the main chain.
What is needed is to let the network scale until it reaches a point that it is starting to strain and no one has workable solutions. Then we can look at alternatives such as LN. But we are not there yet so why cripple the main chain.

This mixes up the concepts of "money" and "currency".
Money is a stable store of value that follows sound money principals. 
Currency is a medium of exchange. 
The two are often implemented with the same mechanism, but not always. For example under a physical gold standard, physical gold is used as both money and currency. But in a gold backed paper money system, gold is money while the paper notes are currency. Today we have paper currency notes only, with no backing stable money unit (which is why we have constant inflation).
The advantage of Bitcoin is it can be used as both money and currency at the same time.

If after an XT fork, if there is real disagreement between users and both branches have a reasonable number of followers, I think satoshi's vision will be the one that will win out. The reason is his vision was the most inclusive and allows everyone to settle transactions directly among themselves. Blockstream coin on the other hand will leave many trapped in the mempool unconfirmed. 
It's pretty easy to see which path will win the most number of users. This is also why the blockstream team is spreading more and more FUD regarding large blocks and the effects of a fork to follow satoshi's vision.

The most common alternative though is to have the 0.01% rule the other 99.99%, and that never works out well for some reason.
A better alternative, but much less common in humanity's history, is to have a constitutional republic that establishes clear rules for society and strongly limits the actions of a democratically elected government. Participation and consent is given by choosing to move too and live in the boundaries of this constitutionally limited republic and this set of clearly established rules.
This was the US for the first 130 years of its history. Government was limited by the constitution and consent was given by choosing to immigrate into the US. A very large percentage of the world's population (not just europe BTW) decided to immigrate to the US during this time and gave their consent to the system.

Yes I have, and so have you but you are misrepresenting them.
Receivers of well formed transactions (i.e. transactions where all inputs are already confirmed, include an appropriate fee, and which are accepted by all your P2P peers [meaning you did not receive any alternative broadcasts using the same inputs]) are very secure with today's P2P rules and easy to accept for nominal amounts. 
Provided most nodes and miners follow satoshi's original rules, and your node can confirm the about attributes, then zero confirm transactions can be relied on for most low value situations.

A better solution is to stop the "too big to fail" policy and let the market work. Glass-Steagall simply replaces an efficient market with inefficient regulators. 
Today's environment: With "too big to fail" large investment banks leverage their commercial banking assets to over leverage themselves in the market. Then when the market crashes the banks run to the government and tax payer to bail them out. 
Glass-Steagall environment: Uses regulators to establish ever more complicated rules which are suppose to keep the banks honest. In reality the government regulators end up becoming captured by the banks and write regulations favoring large banks.
Pre-1933 environment: No regulation and no "too big to fail" policy. Whenever a large bank over leveraged themselves *the bank went bust and wiped out everyone involved, including depositors and lenders*. The result is individuals (the market) watch their banks like a hawk and withdraw funds if the bank engages in anything remotely resembling risky behavior (which it self causes a run). **The result is banks take little to no leverage and were much more stable.**

I think this is a strong demonstration on the real world motivations for miners. 
A lot of ink has spilled saying that bitcoin will be doomed in the long run because of various forms of selfish miner attacks. The reasoning generally assumes miners are incentivized to act in ways that only benefit themselves in every instance. 
Actions such as these demonstrate the large miners are in fact motivated to act in ways that encourage bitcoin adoption. Bitmain could have kept the coins, but instead choose to willingly return found money. We can say they were being nice, etc., but the real reason is miners on motivated to make Bitcoin work properly, even if that means kicking back $20K in found money.

It isn't just that 10Mbps isn't available to the home today (I get 2Mbps down/256Kbsp up), there are also monthly cap limits in the 150GB range. To go over costs $$$. And even if you move your nodes to the cloud (which I have), data transfer costs $$$. AWS charges around $0.02/GB of transfer, that adds up fast.
So in effect, the blocksize discussion becomes a cost per node issue, not a technical capability issue.

Given the OP's understanding of computers from his posts, I don't think he/she is capable of using dd correctly. You need to really understand what you are doing since small mistakes destroy everything. 
OP, your .dat file is corrupt. That is why bitcoind renames it as a .bak file and generates a new .dat file for use. bitcoind NEVER deletes a .dat file for obvious reasons.
The .bak IS your original .dat file. Unfortunately it became corrupted somehow. Since it is corrupted it is probably not possible for bitcoind or any tool to successfully read from it, you are going to have to learn how to do this yourself. 
First make multiple extra copies of your .bak file on different media. Then open it up, if it is all zeros it is useless and your coins are lost (this happened to me one, I didn't care since I had backups), if not then your coins are possibly recoverable. 
You will have to learn how to read the data within a .dat file (your .bak file now) manually yourself. There is documentation online explaining the structure of the .dat file. You are going to have to manually look at the .dat file contents and figure out how to find the private keys in it. For additional complication these keys are probably encrypted if you had a password. In short, the data is probably there, but you need to manually figure this one out.

I didn't even realize changetip worked for Satoshi's, thought bits was the smallest increment they used. 
Probably because changetip's reply always shows bits and dollars, as in "The Bitcoin tip for 1 nyancat (1,784 bits/$0.42) has been collected by americanpegasus."
Funny how with 1 Satoshi this is skipped, probably because the message would be "The Bitcoin tip for 1 Satoshi (0 bits/$0.00) has been collected by xxx"

"I started noticing part way through that he started acting as though I was trying to convince him of something and started getting cunty trying to come up spurious imaginary skepticism about just mundane details about how it works."
In my experience it depends on the person's political ideology and worldview, not on their intelligence or technical savvy. 
Those who tend to look towards government solutions to every problem (both real and imagined), are highly skeptical simply because bitcoin doesn't fit into their worldview and is in fact against their world view. They tend to shutdown on it fairly fast. Sounds as if your friend fits this.
Those who tend to see government as the source of problems and seek methods to limit government power, tend to see bitcoin as an interesting project. This holds both for people who understand the underlying technology and for people who don't really understand the internals but trust others have. 
This is why I think it is ridiculous when people say bitcoin is not political, it is just a technology. Walk into a room of a hundred random people and explain bitcoin to each separately. Then at the end look at who is interested vs those who are not. 
*The line will cut down ideological lines more than any other factor, including technical understanding.*

Way to take Hearn's comments completely out of context. 
The message of that statement/letter you are referring to was Hearn saying that consensus in Bitcoin is a democratic process of users and miners selecting which path to take. And to enable this there should be multiple options for users/miners to choose from, and within any one option there are advantages for the maintainers of that option to choose and set a clear direction, this is very similar to Linus and Linux. 
He said if users/miners to not agree with the decisions of a group of maintainers, then they are free to use another option, and most importantly will have options.
That is the way open source works best. There are lots of forks with different maintainers for each path, and the best option is determined by what gains the widest traction. 
The current bitcoin dev process is broken compared to that. It is not possible to achieve 100% consensus across all devs. There are disagreements. So each group should create their own options and let the market decide. 
That was Mike's message. Way to distort it.

1) You and the others listed have behaved over the past several months as if you control bitcoin can only your views are valid. Case in point the blocksize disaster where you guys claim that full consensus among "core devs" is needed to do so, even if the vast majority of users want it. This is equivalent to saying your approval is required to change things.
2) Opposite of point 1 above, you guys then have taken the stance that you can change bitcoin WITHOUT the consensus of others. There is no large scale 95% consensus to implement the changes for LN. But here you've decided to go ahead anyway. So you are applying one set of standards for yourselves and a different set of standards for everyone else. 
3) You have engaged in a massive censorship campaign deleting all arguments against Blockstream's views and personally attacking everyone who questions the party line. 
4) You are undermining bitcoin by falsely saying it can not scale, where this is absolutely wrong. It can easily scale. As long as independent mining stays decentralized (individual miners, not pools), then bitcoin remains secure. A world where bitcoin has 1000 large nodes run by various entities, and a distributed set of 10,000+ small miners, is a world where bitcoin is operating as it should. You have repeatedly made false statements here.
5) You are forcing the most significant change into bitcoin, one which quite likely breaks the mining incentivization structure, without debate (or more accurately censoring the debate). 
You and your team are an attack on the very concept of Bitcoin. The ecosystem is recognizing this and moving away from you. The fact you don't see it because you are living in your own little bubble doesn't matter. News flash, you are not bitcoin. The ecosystem of users and other tools built around the mainchain are what makes bitcoin and where 99.9% of the development effort has gone.

IBLT is simply a different mechanism to transmit a complete block, one that relies on the fact both nodes already have mostly the same transactions. 
In the end a full block is transmitted for validation. A miner that withholds a transaction until it is mined, still has to announce the transaction in the block when the block is found. It would do so through the IBLT difference information.

If we assume the entire network uses the latest round of power efficient ASICs of roughly ~0.5W/Gh/s, then the network is currently drawing 200 MWatts.

It doesn't matter if YOU choose to not take loans and remain debt free, because other people who compete with you to purchase various essentials required to live (such as housing) do take on huge amounts of debt.
Example: Before the current FED debt based money system with 30 year mortgages and interest only loans, housing was significantly cheaper. Yes without mortgages people had to SAVE before buying a house, but housing was cheaper and many were able to fully buy and own a house debt free by mid-life.
Today housing is at record highs against incomes, this means that if you want to have housing (which you much) that you then HAVE to pay sky high prices. Since you can't afford sky high prices, you HAVE to buy with a large mortgage and pay a significant portion of your life's income as interest to the banks. Even renting doesn't help, because rents go up with housing prices. 
Unless you're willing to live under a bridge, you are forced to pay these artificial prices to the bankers. So you can choose to not take a loan, but it doesn't matter because others DO take these loans (which wouldn't exist without the FED)

Exactly, this is why bitpay and similar are able to verify a transaction at retail point of sale in seconds. 
The reality is if a transaction a) only uses confirmed inputs and b) propagates through the P2P network (which you can verify in seconds), then that transaction practically guaranteed. 
If a transaction meets both those criteria, then the only way the transaction will be invalidated is if the sender colludes with the miner who randomly finds the next block. This is so hard to do, that it's not worth it unless your transaction is worth many millions. So if you need to receive a $10M transaction, sure wait for 6 confirms, otherwise it is fine.

Complete bullshit, lots of apps take donations. 
Google's complaint is probably that donations could be used to get around the fee. Instead of paying for the app and google getting a cut, the developer requests a donation and does not get a cut.
But a donation is just that, a donation. It is not required. If a developer offers free apps with donations to support it, then the app is still free and users are under no obligation to make a donation. 
Edit: This whole centralized app store model is also complete bullshit. In Windows I don't remember MS getting a 30% cut every time someone purchased a piece of SW to run on their PC.

There are lots of cloud services and more every day, each also have their own availability zones with separate outage impacts. So yes the move to cloud nodes will be more centralized than 1 million home nodes, but it will still be very decentralized.
I spent some time configuring my AWS instance to limit costs. The configuration I came up with does the following:
1) For data preservation stores the blockchain on S3 for lowest cost (around $0.03/GB), this copy is sync'ed once a day. Sync's are free BW. 
2) bitcoind uses the local disk for the active blockchain, which is free for both IOPS and BW. 
3) Use the cheapest node with spot instance pricing capped at $0.01/hr, typically pay less. This means that sometimes the node goes off line briefly during a price spike, but keeps cost down.
4) Configured linux instance to use a 2GB EBS volume, so very cheap boot disk
5) Installed wondershaper to limit network BW costs to around $6-7/month
Overall it costs roughly $10 per month, and most of that is network. 
Longer-term we need a project to configure an AWS instance that anyone can easily access through the marketplace and use. Bonus would be to share S3 storage costs which will get more expensive as the blockchain passes 100's of GB or TB.

This is not something people pay attention to or Wall Street understands today. Today Wall Street thinks money comes out of the air because for 100 years it has.

You don't understand what a DAC is. Bitcoin is a DAC company that maintains a ledger and processes transactions between entities. It pays zero tax on transactions, revenue or profits. Please explain how any government can tax or shut down bitcoin for non compliance.

It depends on an individual's risk tolerance and what they are worried about.
If someone is primarily focused on maintaining a fixed number of dollars, then they'll see bitcoin as an unnecessary risk.
If someone is primarily focused on maintaining the **value** of their dollars, then they're probably worried over holding just dollars and see bitcoin as a dollar hedge.

The problem with this is since you are only taxing holder of said currency, to not pay taxes all you would have to do is never hold or own any currency. The rich do not have much (or any) US dollars, they have land, stocks, and other assets. It is the poor and middle class who own dollars as a larger percentage of assets. Derp's suggestion does address this.

This shows how difficult it will be for traditional finance to compete with Bitcoin. Just look at all the layers upon layers of intermediaries required for even the most basic functions. Much of this is required by regulation as well. 
Bitcoin is direct, it is going to be very difficult for banking to compete with this structure.

In 2012 at $10 Bitcoin was a fun project and good idea, but it was still only an idea at that point.
2013 was when real adoption started, both with large scale investors and the VC/startup community. This takes Bitcoin from a fun idea to a legitimate and growing ecosystem, which makes it much less risky. Considering where bitcoin could go both $10 and $800 are early entry points.

The poll said that 42% of Americans know that Bitcoin is a virtual currency.
That is a shocking high percentage and shows how widespread knowledge of Bitcoin is spreading. 
I am curious to see what the percentages are in other countries, those who are bashing Americans might be suprised to see that the US is probably not at the bottom of the pack (if not leading) with that 42% number. In any country in the world you can get 6% of the people to say anything in a poll.

Nothing you said addresses what meowmeow8 said. He said there are some people who are poor (not all poor people) primarily becuase they continously make bad decisions, and no matter what you give them that won't change. This is a very true statement.
Switching a rich baby and an poor baby is immaterial. 
If you switch a rich baby to a poor family that provides a loving and nurturing environment, that baby has a chance depending on who they are. 
If you switch a rich baby to a poor family that is abusive and does not provide an environment focused on education, of course that baby is probably going to do poorly. 
Everyone understand that a childhood environment determinines a lot. But despite that some people are poor because they make bad decisions, that is what meow8 said.

The EFF is fighting the good fight, but they do need to remain compliant with rules and regulations. Being a bunch of lawyers, EFF tends to be extra careful.
In 2011 Bitcoin was still in very early phases and there were too many questions around how to handle the donations.
Now that it is almost 2014 many of these issues have been cleared up. So I wouldn't be too hard of EFF.

Their letter did not state that there was any suspicion of fraud or anything else. They simply state that they do not want you to perform business with another legally operating entity.
Quite frankly this is one of the most shocking things I've seen. A bank is not allowed to dictate who you may or may not perform business with. Yes, they are required to investigate and stop fraudulent or illegal activity. But they do not state this in the letter. The bank simply says they do not want you doing business with Coinbase. 
You should both send the letter to coinbase and also "in paper form" write back to the bank stating that 1) coinbase is a legally operating entity 2) there is no fraudulent activity and 3) you plan to continue doing business with them and if the bank takes issue with that they can either prove something illegal is happening or you will contact a lawyer.
The requirement is on them to prove there is suspicious activity. Buying bitcoin through coinbase is not suspicious activity.

That is why you don't sell bitcoins without either receiving cash in person or through an exchange that will handle the transfer for you (bitstamp, coinbase, etc). 
SEPA transfers are easily reversed, as are paypal. There is a reason bitcoin sell for a 100% premium on ebay, the reason is no one actually receives the money, it is all reversed.

Ironically the US is one of the very few countries in the world that allows foreigners and new immigrents to own and run businesses, yet he has to leave the US. 
Where could Mike go? Asia and Latin America countries are very closed to foreigners, in China non-Chinese can never run a business without a 51% "partner" and Mexico is almost as closed. EU is more liberal, but under the thumb of the Fincen rules as well.
Singapore is possible, any other other thoughts?

If we take that attitude, bitcoin will never grow. 
The bitcoin community has to encourage and accept people once they've come over. That is the way to move the movement forward.

Isn't this something the Bitcoin Foundation should get invovled in? They are an organization for promoting bitcoin adoption in the US and are sponsored by many of the Bitcoin related companies who people are getting banned for interacting with.
There needs to be an organized legal response to all of these closures, which directly target legal tranasactions with specific firms, and not illegal or suspected illegal activity.

Even if this logic holds and becomes official China policy (which is debatable), if the ban is as effective as the great Chinese firewall is I think bitcoin will do just fine.

Fully agree that once someone uses one cryptocurrency, that the barrier to using others is vastly lower.
My current thesis (and it is probably wrong) is that alt coins are driven by pure speculation, while bitcoin is driven by a mixture of speculation and true ecosystem building.
During the last period of relative BTC stability, all the alt coins slowly dropped in price vs BTC. Then when the price of BTC when into the huge ramp to $1000, the alt coins jumped in value at an even faster rate. 
My current expectation is during the next period of stable BTC pricing, the alt coins will again slowly drop in value.

I would absolutely LOVE it if the FED decided to dump their coins. 
First it would be obvious because we know the address and can trace any transactions that go to an exchange.
Second, it would be another chance to buy sub-$1 BTC for those who missed it the first time.
