Like the name - that's funny. Which CAD systems do you use? The models are in Solidworks, been wanting to put them up on our site along with the dxf/ai files for laser cutting the parts and BOM, but been busy with getting V2 ready to ship. Also been looking at moving over to Fusion 360 since Autodesk is offering some nice perks to start-ups to use it. Thanks for your interest. Sorry I didn't respond earlier - I didn't see message in inbox until now.

We've signed up for a devkit when available. The included Arduino headers open up a lot of possibilities. we're currently designing a battery backup which can be used with any Arduino device having the Uno header layout, and considering a software defined radio which would allow nodes to communicate and mesh network over a wide range of frequencies, including TV whitespace along with WiFi.

It makes sense to increase it some for scalability and allow for data when needed, but it should be done in smaller increments on a set schedule, algorithmically. As an example, double it when average block size from a weighted moving average reaches 50% of maximum blocksize. The actual parameters should be determined from a reliability standpoint. Decide "What is acceptable failure rate for some transactions not making it into a block?", then calculate reliability to meet this objective, use this to determine percentage threshold to increase block size and how much to increase.
