Can you recommend an alternative provider that offers unified BCH and BTC payment services, including ability to keep percentages of native coin received, in a clean and reputable provider? Asking for a friend.

Thanks for these two. I'll take a deeper look at coingate.com and have a chat with the landlord of [my local pub](
I think the ecosystem could be helped with the creation of a simple plug &amp; play (pray) POS terminal that does not look out of place sitting next to Ingenico-style devices. There was a recent demonstration on YouTube of a Japanese BCH POS terminal in development. This is the sort of thing we should be encouraging the development of now. I would be happy to buy one of these for a local retail business (or more) to help promote the uptake.

Yes. But you will be treated very differently to natives.

Not Russian, it's Azerbaijan connections. And gambling is legal.
