I'm pretty sure he was referring to dark currencies, as in monero and zcash where transactions can't be traced

I don't think donations go against any of the play store policies.

Well with the malware I imagined, it would back up all private data, as apps expect these folders to be sandboxed away it often contains all the juicy data you can imagine (user/pass, authorisation tokens, private files). The malware author doesn't need to be smart and target bitcoins, just browse what private information is getting stolen, work out some of they are cryptocurrencies, sell the data on or pilfer it themselves.

These are countries not currencies. Austria, Finland, Ireland, and Belgium all use Euro.

I wouldn't be surprised if some of the more niche rom producers included malware in their ROMs. It would be hard to detect and unlikely anyone would look. If you simply had malware that uploaded each apps private directory then that would be enough to steal all of a users private keys from anyone using most of the bitcoin and bitcoin forked projects. As the backups are stored unencrypted in the private directory (as app assumes other apps can't access it).
Also when you grant an application root permission, you have no idea what it is actually doing without checking the source. So you could have installed something which genuinely uses root to do something useful but it also steals all your data without you knowing.

If you have a rooted phone you can use orbot to route any app's traffic through TOR. Should mean one less requirement...

Most merchants have a minimum spend for card and would refuse to charge a 10c transaction. You only find very large companies with lots of transactions allowing small purchases like this as they negotiate a lower fee with the card providers.

If a large commercial entity is interested such as a bank, it's in their best interests to make sure the network can handle what they might want do in the future.

I know ledger wallet just fixed a bug in their API that caused transaction fees in the wallet to be too low.

There is still a paper trail from any businesses you interact with bitcoin that use your identity or address, which counts for most my spending

UK is still in the EU. This won't change for some time if at all.
