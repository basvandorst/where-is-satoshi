It's correct. Never use Coinbase. Use GDAX. Same company. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 21:37:07
We'd need a lot more info to assist, info which does not belong on reddit. You are going to have to hire an accountant.

Pretty sure almost everything is made in China these days.

What is Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:24:50
Many people have used it in the past and had legit encounters.

Only 2 things in life are certain: Death and Taxes

Go to GDAX. Look at the "Depth Chart"
Zoom in. You will see "walls" where there are a lot of people who want to buy and sell at specific prices.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:21:11
Yup. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:09:07
Log into GDAX, which is owned by Coinbase. Transfer your coins from Coinbase to GDAX for free. Then GDAX to Gemini for free.
Coinbase direct to Gemini will cost you money.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:20:36
Coinbase is easiest. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:09:57
Congrats. Share your lessons learned with both communities to give back and pay it forward. May more good karma come your way.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:57:30
Buy the dip. Chill. Repeat.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:40:43
Never for me.
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:35:56
lol. trading on coinbase = uneducated fool
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:18:12
It will move again. Relax and set your buys at the price you want. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:59:56
Coinbase is insured
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:23:33
They probably keep it after issues with the IRS. Open a ticket or try r/coinbase for an official answer.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:46:04
lol. rinse. repeat. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:37:59
Please sell me your coins. I love buying them on sale.  
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:57:06
Depends on many things. Ask a text attorney and CPA, not Reddit.
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:24:08
Which exchange's fees are you trying to avoid?
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:39:55
It isn't lost until you sell.

Look at % and not numbers. They are all WAY up for 30 days ago. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:30:51
Give it 10 banking days (aka no weekends and add a day for the horrible old tech) and see how it goes. I've had lots of issues with "duplicate" accounts when trying to link/unlink.  If Crypto and the sites that go with it are web 3.0, banking is web 0.1 pre release alpha.
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:27:12
For the banking, the banks are slow AF. It might take 10 banking days for them to "close" things out. Coinbase isn't exactly winning the 100 meter dash these days.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:16:52
Yes. They know what it is due to all the media coverage. They will be excited. You are a good person.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:40:59
Good job. Buy the dip. Sell the high. Repeat.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:45:54
Buy the dip.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:18:48
Coinbase is fine. I wouldn't store 1000 coins there.  
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:00:41
You clearly have no idea what you are doing. If you don't know the difference between your bank account and your debit card, you have no place buying crypto. Sorry bro.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:47:46
This is awesome. Good job.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:30:47
From Reddit, you'd think people are sitting on millions in coins based on all the talk of paper wallets and hardware wallets. People are thinking too hard. I keep all my stocks with a broker, why not my coins. It's really not as big of a deal as people think.
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:01:16
That's too advanced for him. He needs Coinbase and remedial reading and math. What are they doing to you people in Canada?
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:39:36
It happens to us all. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:00:21
Cool story bro.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:40:33
It's really not. Look at prices 30 days ago.
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:01:46
No rules say you have to declare.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:19:54
Try Coinbase mobile app. Try from the mobile website. Try a different browser. They are also SLAMMED. ETH and LTC are going nuts, hence more new accounts, hence slow.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:27:39
Every little bit moves the needle.
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:53:15
You'll need to open a support ticket directly with them.
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:25:16
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:26:06
If you own coins in excess of $50,000 you need to think  long term. Anything less is pocket change and find to leave on Coinbase.
