Only racist nazis would need a gun.

I'm going to enjoy myself, and no power on earth can stop me. Go cry about the cheeto-nazi in the white house some more so I can laugh at you.  You can't even financially deplatform me any more... thanks to cryptocurrency. You can suck my alt-right dick

I'm sure there'll be knock-downs. Maybe stop worrying about it for now. Just wake me up when September ends.

Don't think I haven't considered it.  Also crypto-to-crypto is a commodity like-like transaction that doesn't require the payment of capital gains as I understand it.

Not your keys, not your bitcoin.

That's only if your trade actually changed the market-cap.  All you need to happen is for there to be one trade at even a fraction of a bitcoin on one exchange where it's valued at 14k.  You don't need 130 billion, what's the total quantity of btc for sale right now on all the exchanges?  It's a lot less than that, and all you'd need to do is have some one buy a meaningful fraction of it to double the price.

That's how I felt in 2017: 'Maybe it'll hit 10k, but definitely not 12k, or 15, or 20k.'  
... some times we have to admit we were wrong. This is one of those sad days.

So if I register myself as a business trading crypto it's fine then.
@_date: 2019-05-13 21:13:39
I know, I'm not changing it though.
@_date: 2019-05-14 16:02:22
I remember when I said that in 2014. Still true.
@_date: 2019-05-14 16:39:20
I suspect people will not be into this, but it's a cool idea.
@_date: 2019-05-14 16:35:01
Your downvotes won't stop liberals from being clinically retarded.

IMPEACH THAT ORANGE CHEETO. Conservatives are literally racist white men who need to be removed from the country before the genocide minorities.
I'm quite good at understanding how leftists think. Thats why I keep posting nonsense on their forums to be upvoted &lt;3 you guys are an unlimited supply of easy karma.  It's fun, it's easy, and it's like a game for me where I try to see just how unhinged I can get before people stop supporting me. So far I've gotten support for statements like "Stop genocide by killing all the whites" and such.

I was thinking of trading utilizing USDT, I'm presuming that can be held outside an exchange on a private wallet...  Then bouncing back into the market after the inevitable crash.
@_date: 2019-05-13 19:07:06
Quick! sell them for bitcoin!

They're just NPCs can't blame them for it.

My technical analysis: It will go up, or it might go down.
@_date: 2019-05-14 16:05:46
At 90k I might think about retiring.

Literally, all the rest of reddit. I've been saying outragiously insane things on just for the bonus in karma I get for appealing to the nutters in the reddit hivemind.

Trading into USD though wouldn't count as a like-like transaction, thus capital gains comes into play.  Meaning that I'm looking at a loss of 30% regardless. Wat do?
@_date: 2019-05-14 16:05:21
Oh, so that's why this is happening so fast.
@_date: 2019-05-18 21:10:50
If you don't own the metal, it's not your gold.  
If you don't own the keys, it's not your bitcoin.

'Both of me' ?
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:11:27
Sock market goes down, Bitcoin goes up, can't explain that!
@_date: 2019-05-14 15:56:13
Lol, I am fully supportive of this happening.
@_date: 2019-05-13 01:34:04
That... actually sounds almost exactly right.

Winter ended 3 months ago, but only a few people were clever enough to call the bottom.
