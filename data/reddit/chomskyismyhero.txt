Just tried it for £20. Won't let me withdraw straight away.
EDIT: Forfeited the bonus and had to deposit a small amount of bitcoin - I think their system is still setup to process bitcoin transactions so requires a receiving address to make a deposit of 0.0001 BTC.
It has been processed now and I've successfully bought Bitcoin with a credit card.

You're actually buying hashing power on a third party service - not directly depositing money into the casino.
We'll see if the loophole stands up.
PS: I've used them to send Paypal funds and withdraw Bitcoin. Not sure if they will tolerate being used as an exchange though...
@_date: 2014-04-20 00:36:15
I'd be surprised if they didn't considering how low some of the fees are....

Deposit £500 and withdraw the amount required for your intended deposit. Easy loophole to deposit for £5.

There's a simple explanation for why they can't accept transfers; as soon as a bank knows the business model they run.
I've spoke to 4 business banks and all of them wanted to verify money in and money out even on the bitcoin side of things.
@_date: 2012-01-09 18:35:59

Sofortüberweisung. Skrill also have access to some sort of API that allows me to login with my Halifax details and load my account instantly.
Most banks don't have an API. I did research into it and HSBC allowed 100 transfers at once via CSV.
The other banks wanted £1.50 a transfer and it wasn't even faster payments.
Best way is to integrate directly with BACs but this is expensive.

To be fair it could have happened to anyone. Both the current attack and the one before boil down to hosts giving root access ability via convenience control panels.
If you host a VPS then you should have the option to turn off this root password reset abilities or better still offer 2 factor authentication before allowing them.
They can be blamed for the lack of database backups though.

I don't blame them for doing so. I personally would have walked away after the initial hack.
Problem now is that when any of these guys look for work a quick google of their name is going to link them to this fraud (not in liability but the way it was handled).
I'd also like to know how the Bitcoinica scenario has affected their Intersango business.
@_date: 2012-02-24 15:45:03
I was thinking that the biggest obstacle with Bitcoin is that since wages are paid in Bitcoins we have to transfer fiat currencies using exchanges which I see as a potential weak spot.
However sites like this get us away from that weakness.

You are correct. But the majority of customers aren't going to be loading their Paxum accounts, only program owners who payout to affiliates.

If you know the history of Paxum and how it spawned out of the death of E-Passporte you will know that Paxum was setup primarily to service affiliates in the adult industry. That's why they provide support direct on adult boards.

If you are sending Paypal to people in exchange for Bitcoin then the risk of Paypal shutting down your account is much lower.
Although I would structure your business into 2 tiers:
1. Your Bitcoin exchange business with no ties to the Paypal account.
2. Your second business named "Affiliates International" or something along those lines. 
Your business model would be to pay affiliates based upon commission. Commission being (100% - your fee) of the Bitcoin value referred.
It's a loophole likely to be ignored if there was any serious investigation into your business, but to passing eyes it looks legit.
