Right now its essentially a stock in bitcoin becoming a legitimate worldwide currency.  
If you have 100% of your money in bitcoin, and intend to use it as regular currency, your net worth is going to swing wildly day to day, which is a bit insane.

@_date: 2019-03-05 16:24:19
You missed my question
@_date: 2019-03-05 16:53:49


Gee I wonder why...  lmfao.  You're allllmost there.  Keep goin lil guy.
@_date: 2019-03-05 16:44:27
Ok pea-brain, did I ask why '@ = email' or why 'a = mail'?    Think about this slowly so your excuse for a brain can process fully.

I believe this post alone is the reason for the drop.

You're only thinking of the purchaser.  If I sell lambos, why would I accept Bitcoin?
That's why I said

Doesn't have to be causal to be used as a tool.

Aren't those just tied to dollar value or something?  Why not just use dollars?

What conclusions are you drawing, exactly?  You seem to assume BTC will always follow a growth pattern just because it has grown in the past.
At some point bitcoin needs to stabilize so people can actually use it as a currency without worrying whether the lambo they just sold is only going to net them 30% of it's value by tomorrow.  
You just can't use something as a currency if it's value is volatile.  You don't know what you're paying or being paid, which is the whole point of currency in the first place.  
BTC is essentially a stock for a tech company, which needs to convince everybody to use their product before the product can become usable.

Lmao, you are so angry for no reason.  That's how I remember it, sorry I got the numbers wrong.  
I logged in to coin base, and see I purchased at $800 on December 15, 2013. 
I sold June 13 2017 for $2,686.
The point is the same either way.  It can go a lot further down.  Your emotions are so high and your alliances so tight you're blind.

When you cherry pick your dates, this is what you get.

hype.  I dont really care about bitcoin, i'm just telling my position and perspective.  I'm skeptical on it's adoption. 
 It's adoption is based on people's acceptance of it.  Acceptance requires a lot of hype.  People will have to forget this year's losses before they're willing to show interest again.  Hype is the only instrument i trust to really keep any clue as to what BTC will do, and right now it's not in a good spot.  
If you have extra money to accumulate assets for long term holding, then you might want to put a little in BTC.  But I personally just don't.  I can see it dropping a lot farther in the short term and don't really care to play the game.

Looks to correlate almost perfectly.
@_date: 2018-12-13 20:54:02
That is not saying much

I'm not convinced it's time to buy.  
Last time for me went like this:  Bitcoin jumped from $100 to $1500 or $1800.  Then it "crashed" to $800.  I waited a short while and decided to buy in.  Then it finally crashed to sub $200.  
I just held and forgot about it, until last year when I heard it had hit $3000.  I immediately (a bit foolishly) sold.  Then watched it climb to $19,000...  
I knew I missed the boat, and I'm still just waiting for the bottom.  I am not convinced we're anywhere near another rally, so I'll keep waiting.
