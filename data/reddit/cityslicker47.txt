Except the request from IRS says that Coinbase also needs to supply the addresses of where things were sent, which would include a Trezor or Ledger.
How would they prove that the address I sent X btc to wasn't payment for goods to a 3rd party?  How can I/we/they prove it wasn't? 
For example, if I spent 10,000 btc for a fucking pizza back in the day, do I pay tax on that transaction and it's value at that time?  Seems like such a gray area that needs much, much more attention.

I always assumed that smart contracts looked for permissions and allowances via two ways.  
For example, as a tokened user I have an identity that has been proven to show my age.  When purchasing an age restricted item, seller may request access.  When granted it verifies age and allows transaction to go through.  This could go both ways in the transaction with consumer needing certain approved certifications embedded in the product token; think safety standard or certified organic, etc.

Well, I'm assuming the centralized authority would be the architecture built on top of the blockchain, which would serve a specific need.
In my example, once retailer/vendor have been setup in enterprise, they would have authorizations enabled and when there is a match the transaction is fulfilled.  
In my industry this would be massive and cut down on so much needless applications, verifications, and extra work while improving efficiency, speed and overall cost.
