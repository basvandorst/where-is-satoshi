Either all the banks in the world are buying bitcoin or the U.S federal reserve is.

Fantastic news. I hope Europe and other places follow suit. There are just too many trash ICO's flooding the system and robbing gullible people of their valuable coins in exchange for trash tokens and a piece of paper. 
ICO's need to be regulated, if they have a solid business model and a viable product, they'll have no problem getting approved. The only people this affects are the scammers, IE the people that sell ideas on a piece of paper.

It is an addiction trust me, you just have to force yourself not to check. Tell yourself it doesn't matter because you're holding anyway. It's hard but eventually you will go days without even remembering you forgot to check.

Can you give me a link to this chart so I can add some more symbols? Thanks.

I mean did you not save the chart with all the indicators already there? So I can just add a few extra? Nevermind if you didn't save the chart it's fine.

It really ticks me off when people use the term "crashing" for 10% correction. 
A crash is 50% or more in a very short period of time.

Coinbase. However I strongly recommend using their exchange, GDAX as the coinbase fees are borderline criminal. 
Deposit your funds to coinbase and then use the exchange to buy bitcoins that way. Here is a video explaining the process

In the future people will probably issue smart contracts with their private keys inside them, thus being able to leave them in their digital wills to loved ones etc.
But coins that are completely lost will forever remain lost. I wonder how many people have died who owned a lot of coins or just lost their keys.

Absolutely without any doubt. People will move their money into precious metals and some people will move some of their wealth into bitcoin now that it has much more exposure.

If you think that's bad imagine how the guy feels who spent 10,000 bitcoins ($40) back in 2009 on a pizza. Today that would be worth $48million.
