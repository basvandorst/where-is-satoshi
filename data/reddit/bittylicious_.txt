Just to add, we wouldn't accept a blockchain wallet ID of course. There's a sanity check on the main page that ensures the address looks valid.
@_date: 2018-01-15 11:22:05
Take a look at  and inparticular the bottom paragraph. Remember, you're paying for the Bitcoin network fees here.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:05:24
You can go straight to Bittrex. We can never guarantee this in case Bittrex does something weird (like reuse wallet addresses) but this has never been a problem before.
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:46:39
You've really got to buy bigger amounts. Brokers just aren't willing to sell tiny amounts unless they have got almost guaranteed profits after the Bitcoin transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:56:40
I think you'd need to find out where your wallet provider gets its prices. Especially towards the £65 end, prices aren't that bad with us.
You don't say what method you're using to pay though. I presume it's bank transfer, as card payments are very expensive (as detailed clearly in the prices at the main page).
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:03:40
One thing you have to also remember with Bittylicious is that we send you the coins straight away. There are no withdrawal fees, like there are with Local Bitcoins (along with sending ID to random people etc.)
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:50:12
Please do take a read at 
Remember, this is a marketplace for brokers and they are often not offering small amounts, mostly because the Bitcoin fees have been hitting £7 on their own, which makes small sales very loss making.
@_date: 2015-12-24 15:32:45
We probably only let you buy 0.06 BTC as you were non registered and possibly coming from a mobile IP address or proxy. We usually let you buy more, and it just requires you to register and verify your phone number.
@_date: 2015-12-24 15:29:04
Bittylicious is legitimate and has been around for over 2.5 years now. Check out the reviews at 
@_date: 2014-05-14 18:34:36
Why can't we use card fees as an excuse? They're very real.
SEPA are set my the sellers that offer SEPA - it's not set by Bittylicious itself. The seller want to charge a premium for the 2-3 day delay SEPA seem to take to get to UK banks. This is why you find the UK bank transfers, in real terms, better (near instant, low fraud).
@_date: 2014-11-25 15:38:43
You are welcome to email Bittylicious at support We can do custom large orders after some additional checks or simply increase your limits.
@_date: 2014-05-14 10:04:31
The Netherlands is streets ahead of many other EU countries when it comes to bank integration. FWIW, we offer iDeal there as well, so know just how easy it is. Obviously it's more similar to debit cards though, so being able to buy on credit might still be useful.
@_date: 2014-09-20 00:03:52
Or just use one of the clients that lets you sell Bitcoins in your sleep. There's initial setup, sure, but name another site where you can just let it run and it'll sell coins for you.
In any case, Bittylicious isn't set up to make it easy to sell. It's designed to be easy for the average person to buy from.
@_date: 2014-12-21 01:03:51
Guigly, don't worry, nobody will notice the new thread :p
As per that... Hey chaps. Yes, it's not ideal, but we're trying to get some service up and running again right now for new buyers with the wallet for existing sellers being worked on right now (although operations on wallets can take hours).
@_date: 2014-06-25 09:35:17
If anyone wants to see a video of how this works, check out 
The process is actually a bit quicker than this suggests - there have been speed upgrades to the ZipZap back end since.
@_date: 2014-06-25 08:08:08
Just go to  and select cash payment. Alas, you need to be ID validated, but the interface is pretty simple and you'll almost certainly have a location near to you.
@_date: 2014-09-20 00:04:23
When you hit a little above £1000, we require ID I'm afraid. KYC best practices and all that.
@_date: 2014-05-14 18:33:07
It's rarely 10% higher. Ultimately, the bank transfers are up to whatever price the sellers want to set. It usually hovers around 5% though, which I think is very reasonable when you consider exchange rates, speed of transactions and fraud risks.
@_date: 2014-12-21 00:50:37

@_date: 2014-12-21 13:35:08
Thanks for your confidence. Everything is up and running now with no coins lost. I'm still miffed as to how a disk space issue caused such a hassle though.
@_date: 2014-06-25 08:07:27
Go and look at the Bittylicious price. We have been doing this far cheaper than £20 above exchanges.
@_date: 2014-06-26 14:17:32
Sorry, I don't quite get you. Are you representing a LBC cash-in-person trader? If so, I agree.
For ZipZap purchases in any case, my understanding is that ID always needs to be uploaded, whether directly, though Bittylicious it through buybitcoin.sg. Bittylicious does bank transfers, cash, mobile payments and cards in the UK, and it's not at all an 'in person' setup.
@_date: 2014-06-25 08:06:37
Yes, Bittylicious is on board and it's live now. Go and have a play - it's really easy to do.
It did work just fine last time, but only lasted a little while because PayPoint got concerned. ZipZap is now using Payzone, which is almost as popular.
@_date: 2014-05-14 13:11:34
Card processing fees are hideously expensive, so to cover our costs, it costs more.
@_date: 2014-06-25 08:09:48
Well, Bittylicious offers this exact same service, using ZipZap too just essentially via a different reseller.
@_date: 2015-01-22 20:27:07
It's not accepted on Bittylicious at present I'm afraid, sorry. Is there significant demand for it?
@_date: 2015-01-23 06:32:04
As a buyer, it's pretty unlikely your account will get frozen. Sometimes seller accounts get frozen though when fraudulent payments come in. I personally think you have little to lose buying Bitcoins from your bank account, but to be on the safe side, try not to mention that you're doing this.
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:09:40
Just give it time. Who knows, it might not be the case with everybody and there might be other factors here, but there wasn't that much weird on this particular account apart from the sending to a Bitcoin exchange. You are welcome to ignore this.
@_date: 2016-03-08 17:38:57
Doing the same, and Coinkite too. Let's stop anyone else from getting scammed. Thanks for the BRILLIANT work, allstairmilne.
@_date: 2017-03-17 06:21:40
It's an optional client, but my thought would be "not much" considering other companies also do this, including accounting companies.
@_date: 2016-01-22 09:49:52
Yes, it's already up again.
@_date: 2017-03-17 06:23:35
They are "Blockchain friendly" at the R&amp;D end where it appeases shareholders because it looks interesting and a potential way to cut costs. I don't deny this at all.
They are *not* Bitcoin friendly though, and certainly not at the banking end.
Bitcoin is a dirty word in the banking circles.
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:06:36
Your information is out of date. They are not Bitcoin friendly any more. This bank account had only personal payment paid in. The only payments going *out* were to a Bitcoin exchange.
@_date: 2017-03-17 06:34:40
Banks are private companies, under no requirement to open bank accounts for customers. There's a nudge in the form of "Basic bank accounts" but that's about it.
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:23:44
It *is* impossible. Seriously, ask any Bitcoin or blockchain related business, including those that have been around for 4 years, and you will still hear the same answer.
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:07:16
I think the OP was on about Santander, not Bittylicious (which will have traded &gt; £100,000 today, certainly more than two customers)
@_date: 2017-03-17 07:43:14
Oh I agree that the reason these accounts are being closed down is because they are considered risky rather than a direct competition to the banks; I'm not in denial thinking that there won't be any banks in the future or anything like that.
I'm certain they have defined anything Bitcoin and blockchain related as being risky though, and in this particular case, it seems very likely that the closure was due to where funds were being sent to. Hence the pretty direct link between Bitcoin-related activity and the account being closed.
This does go hand in hand with banks not opening any bank accounts to Bitcoin or blockchain companies in the UK. They consider anything remotely in this area as an unacceptable risk. There is an anti-competition argument here (the banking sector refusing banking to an entire, fully legitimate sector), but I don't think it's because they see this as competition to the banks.
@_date: 2017-03-17 06:36:14
We run an exchange/marketplace, and can say this is not an isolated case with Santander over the last couple of weeks.
@_date: 2017-03-19 21:25:16
If you had actually read the link you gave, the final comment said "They're not mine." Those letters are the letters of a broker whose only outgoing payment was to a Bitcoin exchange, and only incoming payments were personal payments (from other accounts in the account owner's name).
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:38:43
Yes, quite simply.
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:14:32
Feel free to give it a go. You'll probably fine Bittylicious one of the most easy for selling, and we have a guide at 
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:59:18
Just change the drop-down. Becoming a proper broker is a very involved process.
As for fees, remember that Bittylicious is a marketplace really, so these are simply the prices that the brokers set, and you get presented with the best price for you.
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:54:52
Many wallets seem to have stupid default settings, and I imagine yours was one of them.
The delay was still entirely on the sending end though, with your wallet provider having far too low a setting. It definitely wasn't the fault of Bittylicious.
@_date: 2017-11-09 10:53:02
Your transaction, I believe, took two hours to confirm (if you are who I think you are). You basically didn't pay enough fees, and it's not fair for the broker to have to have the price fluctuation risk for such a long time when the mistake was your own.
You can't really call bs on this one - the information is publicly available as to when your transaction got confirmed.
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:21:32
Yes, and as the warning says, there is a price range where the cheapest price applies. You didn't paste the entire warning.
Quite simply, smaller trades cost more because the rate is fully inclusive of everything including Bitcoin transaction fees (around £3), manual processing costs, bank risk costs, bank fraud costs etc. We make this all super clear to you at 
tldr; buy a bigger amount. Fixed fees for small amounts make them more expensive.
@_date: 2017-11-19 10:41:32
Yes, basically. Just make sure the exchange address doesn't expire (they don't, generally).
@_date: 2017-11-09 10:57:17
Indeed, here are the stats on that trade:
startedTime (when you started the trade): 2017-11-08 18:34:52
firstTXNTime (when we saw your transaction on the network): 2017-11-08 18:40:07
payingTime (when it reached three confirmations): 2017-11-08 20:36:06
We'd expect the difference between the payingTime and firstTXNTime to be 30 minutes, but it was 1h30m because of your low fee.
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:26:50
The thing you're missing is that we send the BTC to you - in other words, the fee includes the Bitcoin withdrawal fee. I imagine with Coinbase that you have to pay a fee to withdraw the coins.
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:35:11
We have a ledger here too. Usually it gets the fees right so I appreciate your position here. I hope you see where we're coming from though as well as it really has to be the sender's responsibility if the fee is incorrect (and it can't really be our responsibility). We have had transactions that have say unconfirmed for days before.
But you're right, I personally think that 2x out of the way is a good thing, but the markets need a little while to reflect on this (as they're not going to get their so called "free coins").
@_date: 2015-07-01 14:27:16
Bittylicious doesn't have such an age restriction. You won't be able to use all of our card processors (if you wanted to pay with debit or credit cards) but bank account transfers and mobile payments are fine if you're under 18.
Just get a Bitcoin wallet from some other site like blockchain.info and use that with Bittylicious.
@_date: 2015-08-09 21:47:05
Brokers also use business accounts. Just to confirm, no UK banks will give us a bank account for Bittylicious, so we don't have an account in the UK.
@_date: 2015-04-27 19:34:24
HMRC don't do AML regulation for Bitcoin companies btw.
@_date: 2015-04-27 14:49:09
Bitcoins aren't regulated in the UK. There is no need for a money transmitter license here or anything along those lines.
@_date: 2015-04-28 06:09:37
Bitcoin is treated like a foreign currency only for VAT (possibly CGT too) purposes. It is not recognised as a currency in any other way, thus you do not need to be registered.
Believe me. We had an AML certificate from HMRC (I assume this is what you mean). They sent us a letter months afterwards specifically saying that they do not regulate Bitcoin entities and requested we send the certificate back (which we did).
@_date: 2015-04-27 10:31:01
Bittylicious does Faster Payments. It's mostly p2p though, although most of the complicated market-oriented bits are hidden from the user. Relying on one bank account unfortunately doesn't seem to work well, even if a bank initially says it's fine.
@_date: 2018-04-18 13:24:59
Bittylicious is now selling Bitcoin 24/7 to users in Australia (for AUD of course). It might be worth checking us out. If you're with a bank that has PayID, it'll be near instant too.
@_date: 2015-11-27 14:48:05
 is also your friend.
@_date: 2015-11-23 09:47:59
If you wanted to just sell one, you can click the dropdown on the main page, and change it from "Buy" to "Sell". The selling FAQ is really if you wanted to be a broker on the platform.
@_date: 2017-05-25 12:38:39
I can't say how they will be listed, but yes, there will be an opportunity to buy from both chains.
@_date: 2017-05-25 07:12:09
I generally agree with you and also made this point on Slack. However, I think you need to remember that by offering both chains, we're opening up the decision making process somewhat to the free market. If people decide one chain is better than the other, and short the other chain, we could see a chain split being resolved more quickly. If the people put buying pressure on the UASF chain as they believe it has better opportunities, they are voting with their wallets.
@_date: 2015-03-17 11:48:01
We used to allow payments in cash via local corner stores (via Payzone) but demand was really low that we had to stop this because of costs.
It seems as though people are usually pretty happy using their bank account or debit/credit card to get BTC. For those that aren't, then indeed ATMs, Mycelium trader etc. seem to do the job just fine.
@_date: 2017-05-25 12:39:48
Thank you. In all fairness, the code changes were minimal, but we didn't want to run of anybody else's git tree until we compared and reviewed.
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:40:20
Yes, we welcome German users. There are SEPA offers, but for speed you're probably talking credit cards (which sadly are expensive).
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:06:41
Have you contacted us about your identity verifications? We're usually very clear as to why reject documents, so drop us a mail at support if things haven't been made clear.
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:44:02
For what it's worth, we'll see how things go regarding UASF uptake, and the chances are that we'll support the BIP148 chain and the "legacy" chain until a clear winner emerges.
From Bittylicious's point of view, a $1.50 fee on a £10 transaction is mindblowingly expensive. SegWit's been around for ages now, and we need a scaling solution stat.
Having both options available also lets the free market decide, probably speeding up the success of one and the failure of another (e.g. if they decide to sell one chain and buy on another).
~~Martin: You should know we don't hold user funds, so please don't suggest we're gambling with them.~~ (=&gt; Thanks for the edit)
@_date: 2017-05-25 07:10:03
Yes, basically.
@_date: 2015-11-18 15:54:47
Although I'm obviously biased, Bittylicious is pretty easy to use, and for a small amount, ease of use may trump price.
@_date: 2017-07-15 10:24:24
For what it's worth, £6k trades on Bittylicious aren't anything new. Bittylicious has been around for over four years now and we're not going to throw away our reputation! You can check out reviews going way back at 
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:00:26
I understand. I guess the most important thing to note with Bittylicious is that we always hold the cryptocurrency in escrow.
We will never release it back to the broker as long as users keep on communicating. Thus, if you say you sent it but the broker hasn't received it, it will stay in escrow as long as it needs to until things are resolved.
Basically, this shifts trust really onto Bittylicious and not onto the brokers in any way, so you're guaranteed to have a safe transaction.
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:13:10
Bravo to all. This is a good day and the future is even brighter.
