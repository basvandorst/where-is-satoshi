simple solution - transfer to GDAX and then transfer out.  They bundle the transactions and the send fee is zero.

as someone else said - transfer it to gdax then ask gdax to send to another wallet, the transaction will be free.  I'm not totally sure why it's free but it seems that it's bundled with another transaction because I always see at least 2 transactions in there.  it's definitely free though.  enjoy

I'm selling some new magical unicorn tokens and hoping to also capture just 1% of global wealth - 800B in magical unicorns!!

Thanks RottenRook for the sage advice.  Should I keep buying in the 13,000s as well?  Maybe keep picking up shares until it hits 1,000?  What's your bottom?

Way to go - support the drug dealers and criminals so that you can also gain some money via trading currencies!  Are you nuts?  Think about this for a second and consider whether you really want to "follow the drug dealers" to another currency, which would undoubtedly inflate the value of that currency since you would be buying in, and enrich their lives.  You're better off getting a second job, helping an old lady across the street or fighting against political tyranny than trying to make money with altcoins and supporting criminals.  I know it sounds nuts but think about how nuts it is to be directly supporting criminals.  Society has helped you your entire life, why don't you try to help it.

I don't think that is necessarily true.  As more and more stores accept bitcoin, the technology to convert fiat--&gt;Bitcoin--&gt;fiat will likely improve (as it would have to if vendors cannot stomach the potential losses due to volatility), thus reducing the time it takes to actually convert the currency and reducing the amount of bitcoin that is tied up in these float periods.  I think it's dangerous to believe that the price of bitcoin will go up in the future based solely on number of stores accepting them.
@_date: 2014-02-14 20:06:00
I only saw the second part of your reply upon re-reading.  So coinbase can't make such a feature due to the inherent risk, so why would people hold bitcoins with all the risk involved?  They only hold them if they need to make an anonymous transaction or if they are speculators.  Anonymous transactions are a fringe use of money and won't ever reach a high enough volume to make bitcoin worth much more.  Speculators have taken the value to what it is, and speculators are the only ones that will govern its price in the future, in my opinion.  
@_date: 2014-02-14 16:35:29
I don't think Bitcoin can be considered an investment since there's nothing being produced that can then yield a return on your investment.  You are merely treating this as a long term speculation that the price will go up, which is different.  By the way, even if it becomes accepted in every store on earth, that doesn't mean that it will increase in value since stores are able to just convert it to fiat currency as soon as they receive the bitcoin.  People will use bitcoin for it's anonymous nature but when used in that manner it doesn't matter one bit whether each bitcoin is worth a penny or a million dollars.  
At least be aware that what you are doing is speculating, not investing.  
@_date: 2014-02-14 19:03:58
You hold euros because they have a stable value.  Imagine if the value of the Euro changed by up to 1000% per year (like bitcoin) and you weren't going to europe till one year from now, would you hold 5,000 Euros in the interim?  Only if you were speculating that the price would go up!  
@_date: 2014-02-14 17:55:38
Even if more people are buying things in bitcoin, there is still little incentive for them to hold any amount of bitcoin for any period of time longer than is necessary to convert it back to fiat unless they believe the price of bitcoin may rise in the future, which would make them speculators.  In order to really limit the amount of bitcoin in circulation due to transaction float, it would necessitate an extremely high level of economic activity and there's little reason for me to believe that bitcoin will supplant fiat for most transactions anytime soon.
Coinbase wouldn't make such a feature, at least not while bitcoin volatility is so high.  That's taking on a huge risk that could easily cost them their entire business.  
Ultimately, someone does need to hold the bitcoins - the speculators.  I don't think holding bitcoins is necessarily a bad idea, I just don't think it qualifies as an investment.
@_date: 2014-02-14 18:38:20
Why do you think the price of bitcoin matters for its usability?  Perhaps the penny vs million dollars comparison is too broad, but on a slightly smaller scale, it really doesn't matter to anyone using bitcoin for anonymity whether the bitcoin is worth 10 dollars or 10,000 since you are converting fiat to bitcoin, paying, and then the recipient is converting the bitcoin back to fiat. 
I don't think acceptability will affect the value of bitcoins, no.  No one wants to hold bitcoins unless they are speculators and thus the supply of bitcoins will be used for anonymous commerce but won't be held by anyone other than speculators.  Rubies are a bad analogy in this case because they have inherent beauty and thus have value themselves.  Bitcoins aren't beautiful nor can you use them for anything other than as a medium for payment and thus only has value as long as speculators are willing to hold them.  For the bitcoin price to go up, you need more speculators buying them.  Even if every online store accepted bitcoin do you think people would convert all their hard-earned dollars to bitcoin to buy things online?  What would be the point of that?  Do you think that average people will buy and hold bitcoins just to watch the value of their hard work yo-yo incessantly?  
Perhaps there will be another reason to use bitcoin in the future, but for right now we don't urgently need to replace fiat currencies and therefore I don't see widespread acceptability itself driving the price of bitcoin higher.

You are seeing price manipulation at its best.  Remember that over 100 new hedge funds have entered cryptocurrencies and have resources and knowledge vastly superior to your own.  You won't win this battle, sadly, and trying to time the market is a mistake.
I feel as though we are all being manipulated and encouraged to buy more "on dips" to make the hedge funds a ton of money.  Sheep led to the slaughter.... :(
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:26:29
Of course they aren't buying now, they are selling, they were responsible, I think, for the huge run up that encouraged more people to jump on board.  They pump and dump.
And, by the way, the smart money works EXACTLY in that way - they manipulate the price to trigger buy/sell orders at various stops.  It's exactly the same in the stock market.  They manipulate with their vast resources to extract profits.  Hard to know what each is doing but it seems to me like the sells yesterday at the highs were coordinated.

bitcoinwisdom.com is the best i've seen
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:10:47
No, stop wasting your time.  You won't win.  You might get lucky but in the end you'll just amass trading fees and probably just lose your bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:27:45
how do you know that they are losing money?  how do you know they aren't the ones that are selling and taking their profits?  who scaled in over the last few days to take this to the ATHs?  300,000 accounts on coinbase - that's not hedge funds bro
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:33:11
I seriously think the part of wall street that has interest in bitcoin and would speculate in it have already done so.  There's no underlying profit coming from holding bitcoin so it seems unlikely that bitcoin would replace traditional investing in stocks of companies that generate profits, etc.
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:21:31
Of course, it wasn't intended to prove anything, just share a thought about the price of bitcoin and why it has advanced so far.
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:37:15
This might be helpful: 
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:19:47
This is just my opinion, that's all.  The huge recent increase in the price is obviously speculative and the trade is getting crowded, half of wall street has already moved into bitcoin either for short term plays or long-term.  
Unfortunately, I don't think there is much more room for it to run at this point. In my opinion, it will take a major event to make bitcoin advance from here and it is more likely for the price to go down in the short/mid term.
@_date: 2017-10-26 09:31:59
Buying bitcoin is not a business, it's just speculation.  You're better off actually starting a business and working hard to make it successful.  Sitting on a bunch of bitcoin won't ultimately feel very satisfying regardless of where the price is in a few years.
@_date: 2017-10-25 12:03:48
I get that you think my rationale is weak but if people that don't even know what a blockchain is or how bitcoin is mined are telling you that they bought bitcoin wouldn't you think that awareness has potentially topped out?  
I understand that bitcoin might go up from here, could go to 50K, but I don't think it will.  If there isn't a substantial event that brings in new speculators then the price will either plateau, or more likely, go down as the speculators that are here leave.
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:44:26
I guess we'll see who has the right idea.  When people I consider to be uninformed are telling me they are buying bitcoin to get in on the action I consider that a pretty good indicator of a top.  Cheers.
@_date: 2017-10-25 12:47:58
I agree that more people getting involved in Bitcoin would raise its value somewhat but the levels it has risen to are due to mostly speculation, not inherent value.  I think the speculation is a crowded trade and there's not much upside from here while the potential downside is extensive.
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:33:34
Doesn't take much help or much money to start a business - you can start an online business with almost no money, plus you seem to have some money since you're buying bitcoin.  If you're willing to work for it, you can achieve it - that's the key.
Definitely don't do something that drastic about your life if bitcoin doesn't dramatically rise in value.  You have value and purpose in this world, you just need to figure out where/what it is.  Start by helping others and you might start to feel better about your life when you see the gratitude of others.  Hang in there.  Send me a PM if you want to chat.
@_date: 2018-04-07 09:15:46
yes, it does.  The number of shorts is insanely high, which means that if the price starts to rise, the shorts will be squeezed (they need to buy back asap or risk a price that is continuing to escalate out of control - similar to what was seen in late 2017).  The fact that so many short positions have been opened (6K coins shorted in last 2 days) while the price of bitcoin has been steady is very bullish.  When price starts to rise, these 6K coins will need to be purchased (32,780 coins in total).
@_date: 2018-04-06 21:35:13
Bitcoin Shorts are hitting an all time high while the market swallows their shorted coins: 
If BTC can make a run, the shorts are going to suffer immensely.  Should be epic if we can get a whale to step up and get the bids started...
@_date: 2018-04-06 22:46:50
Another 200 coins shorted in the last minute, and a down spike in volume of 200 coins - guess we know who the sellers are!
@_date: 2018-04-07 10:02:22
yes, the shorts are convinced that bottom is yet to come while the longs are convinced otherwise - time will tell.  That being said, the short side of the equation has gotten more crowded so if the price starts to go against them, they will need to panic buy.
@_date: 2018-04-06 22:15:00
Exactly.  3428 bitcoins were shorted on bitfinex in the past 24 hours - I can't wait for these people to buy them back!
