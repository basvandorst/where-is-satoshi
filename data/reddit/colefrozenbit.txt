why? Seems like reddit is censoring bad reviews of greenaddress. So is greenaddress covering bad reviews and botting their threads too? Some red flags are coming up, greenaddress isn't as green as I thought.

Wow this series is old, first video talks about Mt. Gox as being your wallet if you don't want to use the bitcoin qt wallet. Glad this is out there because I've seen Khan Academy endorsed, but I wish the bitcoin series could be updated.

Guess the people who downvoted are waiting on their xapo debit card.

Our wallet is both more secure, and more practical in approach. We generate and hold ZERO keys which means you retain full control. Also we're open source so you can fork, and add/subtract anything you don't want. We also 2 of 3 multisig, without a central server unlike green address which means we have NO say over what you do with your bitcoins, and unable to access your funds. It's just a better way to securing bitcoin. Also, N-lock isn't required for us, since you hold ALL your keys.

I want to design most of the things on your list but I don't have the time now. Maybe later today I can come up with one.

We don't rely on a false sense of security. When you use frozenbit you can be assured by the fact YOU and ONLY YOU control your keys. We don't use n-locktime because we believe users should be able to use bitcoin without our hand in their cookie jar. I believe it's both more practical and more efficent than greenaddresses system. It's also more trustless and leaves no worry if your coins will be there tomorrow or the next day because simply they WILL. No one and I mean no one can possibly access your keys because all generation is done client side. Where is green addresses? I see nothing about that on your site? Security should be standard, and transparent not hidden.

Yes, that is correct you get a piece of EVERY deposit.

I'm just here for the bribe, jkjk. The main thing I would be excited about is that you're your own bank, and there is no middle man at all. Just stress proper bitcoin storage.
