Bitmixer seems to be just as shady as the rest.

I saw one the other day that said COINBASE  updated the users withdrawal limit. Sorry, don't have a screenshot. Be careful!

Ever heard the expression, "Measure twice, cut once?"

That is really cool. Who knows, that could be priceless one day!

I'm not referring to the stock market. I am talking specifically about the Bitcoin market. There are no technically plays; pure luck.

This piece of junk can be crafter together with a Rasberry Pi and a Block Erupter USB. Anyone who wastes their money on this garbage is seriously just contributing to the problem.

You will never mine enough coins with that crap to purchase anything. You're essentially paying for the right to waste electricity.

That is actually a very novel idea for ensuring patient record confidentiality in compliance with HIPPA law.

Thank you! People like to downvote the truth when it comes to useless BTC miners nowadays!

Because they don't even know what they bought!

That's hilarious, I was comparing the 21 to a Pi last week. Look how butthurt some of these people got defending a piece of hardware that they don't even understand. 
@_date: 2015-11-10 20:58:11
Because it is probably not ready to ship because it's full of bugs, or they are trying to figure out a purpose for it. More likely because ... vaporware like most other BTC mining companies that scammed the shit out of people or went bankrupt.

Yes, I think most people know this. Another great site for tracking down transactions is

So what are you going to do with this "$400 development station" that you can't already do with COTS software?

There has been a lot of conspiracy of BTC shuffling over the past week. Would not be surprised if this was a cash out or market manipulation via collusion or bot.

Sorry, technical analysis is about as useful for Bitcoin as forward gears on a French tank!

Hi there, can you elaborate on how the address was hard-coded into your ad? 
What type of ad? 
How many ads were compromised?
How many transactions to make up the 0.29btc total stolen?
There are a lot of exploits in the wild right now; maybe I can help you narrow it down. PM me if you do not want to disclose details here. 
    Now to follow the money:
* The "hard-coded" address:
* Sent to this wallet with multiple other Tx inputs:
1EE5XHJU4JEA7N2fLbGgexB7z2cHJ6sNFY 
* Sent to this wallet with multiple other Tx inputs:
* Final Address: Cold? [27.5 BTC] Balance, Last Accessed: 11/12/2015 21:01 1N4netfrVwSY4sP7MQC4yTEA5TW8FXkAHg 
Click on the large Tx blocks to trace it down to the final address. Blockseer.com is great for this: 
Now, if you take the final address and perform a reverse taint analysis on it, you will see an IP address, and perform a WHOIS lookup. A little bit of research brings you to Signet ISP in the Netherlands which could have been used as a relay.

LOL, ok I'll agree to disagree. You must be diving in coin u so smart.

A lot of times I don't even measure, I just eyeball it.

I don't even understand what you just wrote.

By looking at the timestamps of other transactions moving into these wallets at the same time, it seems this happened to more than just you. I am assuming that this was a semi-sophisticated hack/phish/exploit. 
You're lucky you didn't get hit with this as they are starting to become unstoppable:

Wow 2 years you must really be an expert! If everyone could simply trade on technicals then we would all be rich.

I wish I could absorb the Fed's money and then spend it, as needed, in times of inflation :)

Thanks, sorry about that ;)

Funny how they don't mention the $8.5 Trillion taxpayer dollars missing or the tens of millions that have been stolen/embezzled. This is public knowledge.

From the image that appeared on twitter, this is supposedly GhostSec's bitcoin donation address. Doesn't seem like they got a lot ... Also, most btc moving in and out of these wallets are associated with DNM's.
