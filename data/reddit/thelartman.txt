You can draw on the graph at any point to make any trend you want. It just depends where you start it from. You could draw an uptrend line from yesterday's low of ~ 9200. Or a downtrend line from last month's ATH.

You do not have to choose. Your BTC wouldn't change to BCH. However many BTC you have, you would then have that same amount in BCH. It's a chain split, so pre-1st August, the chains for both BTC and BCH are identical.

No, you should be able to sell your BCH without affecting your BTC. This is what 'replay protection' is all about. Something that was not present in the proposed SegWit2X split.
I've never used Trezor so I don't know the specifics, but I assume you will be able to easily access your BCH. 
And yes, the 1st august BCH split was pretty much free money.

Yeah. I aimed to use it on my raspberry pi. But Syncing straight to the pi will take too long (apparently) so I was adivsed to sync it using my pc first to an hdd, then use it on the pi.

It did a similar thing yesterday. Dropped in the morning and early afternoon then stabilised late afternoon and evening. (I'm on GMT)
So if it follows that pattern it will recover slightly tonight before a further dip tomorrow morning. 
Or it could be co-incidence. Who knows? Make your own mind up and buy or sell accordingly.
