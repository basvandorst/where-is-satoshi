They won't

Whether you can sell it at a high price or not, you missed out, and the same goes for whether you can sell it quickly or not.
It's still free money to an extent, people are so in denial about it, if you missed out and didn't take the time to make sure you got the free BCC then it's on you.

The difficulty change only just happened, it's not gonna be an instant switch
Next 48 hours shall be telling

Very slow mining confirmations
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:39:44
Yes I do, I have BCC and people that don't have missed out.
To what degree they missed out, is going to depend on how long it takes to be able to sell it, and how badly the price crashes.

Still has a big market cap, really wonder what will happen to the price of BTC. New ATH coming?

I haven't seen a single one in months...

I live in Japan and have never found this to be the case. Small eateries won't accept cards, but this is no different to other countries. If I wanna use my card, I usually can. 
There's a bunch of loyalty cards that can be used for many different stores and services, I don't think it feels like things are lagging here when it comes to payments. Even my TV has T Point card integration, no idea what it's actually used for though.


Going all in is Fake News. However, DMM and Mitsubishi Bank opened Bitcoin exchanges recently, Rola (popular celebrity) is advertising Bitcoin for DMM which caught my attention in particular.
DMM is a huge company here, so that's kind of a big deal I think.

What? Electricity isn't THAT expensive. Your miner needs to be earning like 2 bucks a day here to not cover electricity (assuming 1200w)

I'm confused by what you're saying, most people mine BTC on a pool too. The Antminer S9 is 2200 bucks and mines like 13 a usd day which is a better value than buying multiple GPUs right now

Anyone who was mining BTC at a "shitty" $10 a day or less back in early 2017 has made over 5x that money now, and over 10x back in December.
So depending on your perspective, it's still very much so worth mining BTC.

What's the point?
Bitcoin would need to triple just for you to turn that $3 into $9

Electricity does not surpass revenue unless you're a dumbass using old power hungry cards. Best way to get BTC payments is through Nicehash or mine more profitable coins and convert.
And no your school computers will not be even close to worth using.

Don't have one, I'm not getting my panties in a bunch either way pal.
@_date: 2017-06-27 20:21:54


It isn't, there were articles in the WSJ about the recent crash
@_date: 2017-06-25 07:46:11
Why do people buy these when you can just GPU mine other coins and convert those to Bitcoins faster and cheaper? 
I must be missing something. Or no I'm not.
@_date: 2017-06-25 08:21:02
I mean you can mine other coins with GPU mining then convert them to BTC at the end of the day/week.
I'm making about $70 worth of coins a day atm with a 6x1080 Ti rig

Well, Bitcoin is the daddy but its transaction speeds are kind of a problem, Ethereum, Litecoin and Digibyte spank it in that department.
