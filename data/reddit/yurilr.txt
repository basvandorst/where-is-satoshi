Found it yesterday that the alpha version is out. Definitely it needs some polishing, I recommend e-mailing sugestions to the people developing it.
Contact info can be found here

If it says encrypted it's encrypted. It only asks for a password when you need the private key, so when you spend.

Were someone to do that the bitcoin price would certainly plumet by more than 50%. There is no financial gain for someone to do that.
And a single entity controlling 51% of the mining power this days, unless a government decides to do it, is nearly impossible

Could be a spike in hash rate, just a coincidence or a combination of both
@_date: 2014-11-02 22:36:10
Not if the person doesn't know how to hide it

Bitcoin price : AUD $513.55

Did they refund everyone or fled with the money?
@_date: 2014-10-18 07:40:47
Not in the near future. And if the time comes it won't be sudden, there are several quantum "compatible" cryptographic ciphers and more would be developed.
Bitcoin would just adapt, way ahead of the danger

If bitcoin fails to develop to be an actual major currency and/or payment system, we are late adopters.
Otherwise we are not
@_date: 2014-10-14 03:48:37
Isn't Philippines banning bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-10-12 08:34:44
But they have few deposit options
@_date: 2014-10-13 07:27:57
Of course there are scammers, and there is very little btcjam can do if the amount is small. The site itself is trustworthy. They check the loaners and give thei ratings, but an A+ rating does not guarantee it's going to be paid back.
If the idea is to gain interest on a regular basis, you should distribute your btc in the largest number of loans possible so if you take a loss in some you will still profit on average.

I'd rather keep it only on cold storage than on coinbase and circle... You could also store the bip38 encyrpted private keys on the cloud on an encrypted file.
But so far what was your average price per bitcoin? Unless you bought most before the 2013 end of year bubble you are already at a significant loss.
@_date: 2014-10-12 23:14:45
Send the 100 btc to this guy then.
@_date: 2014-10-19 08:31:00
Just store an encrypted file on some different cloud services like DropBox, Google Drive and OneDrive.
Far safer method
@_date: 2014-10-26 01:16:23
That's a nice way to rob people with an excuse, those who withdraw are ok, those who miss the deadline, get scammed
@_date: 2014-10-19 19:53:35
Doesn't really matter, the more services you use the more redundancy. I recommend at least three
@_date: 2014-10-13 01:14:45
That's impossible, a block has to be generated for it to get a confirmation (which on average takes 10 minutes), no matter how much you set for the fee, this isn't going to get any faster.
Since the block limit is 1MB and it's very very rare to get this big, with the default fee, you are going to get a confirmation as fast as trasnsactions with a higher fee.

Please explain how exchanges that work with fiat doesn't also work with fractional reserve, since this fiat is in some bank.
@_date: 2014-10-19 19:52:42
As the other guy said, if you don't trust encryption, why trust bitcoin? If the file with the private key is encrypted, there is just no reason to fear storing those in the cloud.
@_date: 2014-10-09 06:12:35
How does one secretly mine a block?
@_date: 2014-10-12 23:07:01
If the person actually owned the private key they wouldn't send a transaction in to prove it, this person would send a transaction out to an address he can just not even record the private key if the person is worried the FBI would be able to track him down.
What a stupid scam
@_date: 2015-01-16 13:45:43
It's essentially the same, if there is no backing, it's worthless.
@_date: 2015-01-17 22:47:48
Better than remembering the password directly, it's safer if you use this password with the addition of a keyfile in an encrypted file containing the password, using keepass for example, and in it, store a random password generated by a program (humans can't really generate random passwords and remember it).

He is not being charged at this time for the murder for hires, and very likely, won't.

Good luck actually buying and importing the data center.
@_date: 2015-01-13 02:07:29
You can import them into another blockchain.info wallet.
Right after that I'd move all the funds to another safer wallet
@_date: 2015-01-19 08:45:59
Not even the argentinians where, even though the ones that are in it make enough noise to make us believe that their number are big.
In the case of the greeks it's even a worse example, the ones afraid are likely to just cash euro and keep it (or transfer it to another euro country), if they are afraid of future capital controls, savings confiscation or greece changing it's currency
@_date: 2015-01-21 11:18:21
That doesn't eliminate the possibility of them running away with all the money.

"bitcoins purchased will be delivered within 21 days from the date of approval"
@_date: 2015-01-21 08:34:48
Not the banks exactly since this was a governement program mainly using public banks and forcing the privates one to accept it.
Still good though.
@_date: 2015-01-30 02:00:08
If you don't trust yourself I think they are at the moment one of safest way to keep your coins in a way that the provider of the service control the keys. They also have the option to let you control the keys in a 2-of-3 multisig wallet (where they hold one), but if you don't trust yourself, don't use this option.
Remember to enable 2FA

I still have no idea why defense wanted his testimony, this is not a trial about bitcoin, people just need to know how it works at a basic level.
@_date: 2015-03-17 07:18:19
Not possible. You could find someone that would take it, but it's very hard for anyone to trade btc for paypal without the seller having an extensive trading history.
@_date: 2015-02-05 14:05:34
I've been using the greenwallet in my phone and this looks great, but there is only an important function lacking, enable the user to set the transaction fee like it was possible in the greenwallet app
@_date: 2015-02-01 04:12:36
Likely because it will be paid per use, which will be very cheap, making micro payments necessary.
