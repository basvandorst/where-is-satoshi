As long as you’re total profit amount is less than the taxable amount, you shouldn’t have to pay any taxes. 
In the UK for example you don’t get taxed on anything below £11,000 a year.

You need to get hold of your private keys, uninstall electrum and delete its folder from appdata, reinstall it, then resynch the wallet with your private key
Another method is go to blockchain.info, create an account and go to settings then add a btc wallet, paste in your public key then try and send your coins to a btc address that you own, it’ll ask for the private key, paste it in, job done.

Money is not flowing into the exchanges because banks don’t process wires over the weekend, people are using credit cards to buy small amounts of BTC only.
Also there are a lot of people who bought at 18k, 17k 15k that are panic selling to catch the xrp (cripple) 
Wait till Monday when the dust settles, and the king shall rise again, that’ll be the time when the alts shall bow.

The writer of this article doesn’t know the difference between a public and a private key, in other words they were a fucking moron.  Example: look at Blackcoin, as soon as it went proof of stake, its value plummeted. Also in order to stake a coin you need to have a ridiculous amount of it. Proof of work is the way to go on a cpu/gpu algorithm like Crypronight, it is efficient and power-friendly, anyone with a pc can mine it.

They're not banning it; they're creating FUD: fear Uncertainty and Doubt. 
At the same time they're buying through brokers at the dips.

Satoshi would have never invented btc if he had known it would be forked like this, it's against the spirit of crypto and its purpose, which is to give power to the resistance against the corporate greed and the rigged banking system. Last time a fork occurred, traders held btc just to get credited in BTC cash and then cashed it into fiat. 
Bitcoin will no longer be special if another fork takes place and it will lose its authenticity, to put it simply it will no longer be rare.

It's not a scam, because the terms of the bonus are out there.
When you make a deposit and claim a bonus, you will be required to wager your total balance at least 20 times... sometimes up to 30x 
This could mean essentially losing it all before meeting that requirement, should the games be tight.
