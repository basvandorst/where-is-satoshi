If they have proof you cashed out some coin (someone filed a 1099-B on you) and you try to pull a Wesley Snipes you will have a very bad time. The entire virtual/fiat thing is irrelevant as it's based on the capital gains income and not the philosophy or deep thoughts by Jack Handey behind that income.

Parkinson's? That hand jitter makes me nervous.

They are not misreporting it. They report sales and it's the user's responsibility to keep track of their basis in what they sold. It's that way with all capital gains transactions. I have 15 year old brokerage statements that I will need some day when I sell securities I own. 
The system really stinks as it puts a lot of responsibility on the taxpayer to keep some really old records and to know what to do with them. Most tax payers need to pay someone to figure it out. Tip: H&amp;R Block is not the right place to go.

The Taxpayer Advocate office of the IRS might be who we need to talk to if this turns into something more than just letters sent. They are basically the only oversight to the IRS when they get out of control and are not following the laws or regulations in place.

Trust and Facebook do not belong in the same conversation.

I can't wait to see how badly BOA messes this up. It won't be Wells Fargo bad, but it's going to be a mess.

I bought a much smaller denomination (50,000,000?) on ebay several years ago. It basically cost me postage plus $1 USD since it was worth less than the paper it was printed on.

They are terrified by the thought of not controlling the money (not controlling the people). I can't even guess where this is going, but I'm going to call it progress. Better go make some popcorn to snack on while I watch the show.

There's like 1,500 people there. And they're all a bit busy working 80 hour weeks making $65/hr.
