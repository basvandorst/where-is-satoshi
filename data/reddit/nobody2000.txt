Charlie Shrem may be a scammer, or he might not be. 
What's true is that he makes very little efforts to right these sorts of things, and always has. Even back in the Dailycheckout.com days, he ran a sloppy operation. 
Customers' orders were often unfulfilled, or wrongly fulfilled (go to the defunct dailycheckout facebook page and look at the feedback). 
Dailycheckout was small potatoes compared to the BTC game that he's running now. Maybe he's not *intentionally* scamming people, but a lack of organization, pure sloppiness, and probably an element of laziness clearly are Charlie's attributes that've made him so popular and successful, and have been par for the course for him since day 1.

Because one charge is heinous and deserves a lifetime in prison...
...the other is stupid - that he was facilitating a non-violent marketplace for people to trade in drugs, and he got more time than most rapists, murderers, or drug dealers.

Let's take a step back. 
It's clear what the law says, and you're right. I can't argue with how the law treated him from the pure basis of that's what's written and that's how racketeering offenses have been handled since RICO was written.
However, maybe I should be clear that my gripe is more of a idealistic one - that someone who facilitated a non-violent marketplace where people dealt drugs got a heavier sentence than most murderers, rapists, and drug dealers. 
That's what's bullshit. Yeah - he broke the law, and the sentencing was handed down at its fullest extent. Gotcha. That still doesn't make me think it's any less bullshit. That this country is so scared that people might be able to get drugs non-violently and THAT deserves super harsh punishment while they leave alone the murder stuff just because it was a harder case to build.

Correct, but it's silly that he got 2 consecutive life sentences for facilitating a non-violent means of trading drugs, but the actual heinous crime wasn't even charged.

While that may be so in the judge's mind, that's not what was publicly stated by the sentencing judge.

"Because RICO" (insert other ambiguous statements followed by disgust that some other guy on the internet wouldn't go research every aspect of racketeering law).

Wow dude quite the jump there. That like when someone is casually discussing why a car might work/not work, and you just jump in with "well if you can't be bothered to learn about internal combustion..."
Chill out, okay?

Whether that's true or not, he wasn't charged for this. 
This is the problem with the whole thing. If he's guilty of conspiracy to commit murder, then by all means, hit him with that. 
They didn't bother. They went after him on the silk road operations.

Okay - you're on a board with a bunch of people who are probably not lawyers, nor are they familiar with very specific laws. 
RICO has to do with racketeering, yes, and it has to do very specifically with some of the things that DPR was tried and convicted for. 
But the fact that someone brought up the conspiracy to commit murder in this thread is pointless, as [The judge didn't consider it in her sentencing]( and he wasn't tried on it. He was sentenced based on the other things. 
There - you want to talk about contributing? I just explained RICO very basically - more than you did with your vague "durr, RICO!" rants. 
You sound like someone who saw "The Dark Knight" and learned about RICO from Maggie Gyllenhall's character.

Not exactly:

I didn't say it wasn't illegal. I was eluding to the fact that it's bullshit that he's serving 2 consecutive life sentences for the same shit that others spend a few years in jail for.
