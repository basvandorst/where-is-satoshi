If you understood what Bitpay said, then you would know they're not talking about your tx fee. 
Time to learn how to read.

Read my comment above.
If you see BCH getting adopted as an attack on BTC but LTC getting adopted is not then you don't talk from logic, but emotion. 
The same crowd who was telling everyone to sell BCH because it would go to $0 are now too emotionally attached to form a logical discussion. 
Think about it.

Where did you read in my comment about boycotting any coins?
Don't put words in my mouth. If you need clarification, ask
I talked about the boycotting businesses that adopt BCH. Don't tell me you have not seen it here in this sub. 
The irony is if you're afraid that other coins's adoption would kill your coin, then your coin is already dead. LN was promised 24 months ago. If the tech works, it does not need preaching and boycotting.

Why do you think vicious attack on BTC is the cause of BCH adoption? 
Anyone can go on social network and attack any coins they want, at the end of the day it is the businesses who see what's best action to take. 
You really think businesses can't think? 
Talk about united, go ask the crowd who sold BCH after the fork then continued to attack BCH. 
If you think BTC can be killed because of mug slinging, then it is not worth to have in the first place.

There are only 2 type of people in this world: Nails and Hammers. 
I'm happy for you either way.

This is good. Showing the advantages of first adopter. 
Intel, IBM, AMD, Nvidia.... time for you to take action.
Whoever thinks this is bad news, they dont understand what how free market is created.

I have this username before BCH ever created LOL. 
I liked to troll buttcoiners back in the day.
BTW, i see you're getting too emotional (as i said about, love LTC but hate BCH not because of logic but emotion). I suggest you to step back and think it over and ask yourself, why you invest in BTC? what gives BTC value? etc.... You don't have to tell anyone. But if you're too emotional maybe you're already doubting yourself.
PS. The fact that you blame the recent BTC price drop because of BCH is alarming. You need to research more. I think it is simply the market is no longer hyped and the traders are having fun. Fundamentals are what matter.

Not sure what you mean by bitcoin founders and how they're involved in this. As far as everyone knows, Satoshi is the only founder/founders of bitcoin. 
If you followed the history of the fork, the mug slinging started when people said forking BTC is an attack on BTC. If Bitcoin is truly a permission-less network, forking should be embraced. Nobody can stop the fork and attacking it would legitimate the fork even more. 
Let others make their decision, don't tell them what to do but how to think.

keep believing that you goons. Mean while early adopters are switching. Dumb money is the one does not see writings on the wall.

There is BCH to be used as currency. BTC is for HODLING!

I disagree, The crowd who is refusing to embrace the adoption of BCH is BTC crowd. Have you seen the "boycotting list". The hypocrisy is so strong among them that no one ever takes them seriously.
