Then bring up a cloud host somewhere :) Windows really shouldn't be an issue. Python runs there. Although I'm not sure what the Windows 'cron' equivalent is.
TBH, if the instructions in the original reply don't make sense from a quick read through you'll probably end up not being able to get this stood up in time. If anyone /really/ wants, message me throw-away email address and I can add it to notification that will go out if one of those pages change.
The disclaimer is that you shouldn't depend on this notification for anything critical, my instance could end up in a black hole, or hell those pages might not change until long after the decision is made.

Just in case:
     python
    #
    # Expects credentials and config set up in $HOME/.aws/
    #
    
    import boto3
    import requests
    
    topic_arn = '&lt;YOUR ARN&gt;'
    client = boto3.client('sns')
    
    
                   # URI, Terms, Notify if:
    TO_CHECK = ((' ('Winklevoss', 'Bitcoin'), True),
                (' ('Winklevoss', 'Bitcoin'), False),)
        
    
    def send_notification(uri):
        response = client.publish(
            TopicArn=topic_arn,
            Message='CLICK THIS LINK: {}'.format(uri)
        )
    
        print 'Response: {}'.format(response)
    
    
    def check_page_for_term(page, terms):
        r = requests.get(page)
    
        for term in terms:
            if term in r.text:
                return True
    
        return False
    
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        for site in TO_CHECK:
            uri = site[0]
            terms = site[1]
            notify_if = site[2]
    
            if check_page_for_term(uri, terms) == notify_if:
                send_notification(uri)
Configure SNS to send email, SMS, and cowboy-gram and wrap in a cron job ezpz.
Edit: FWIW, I'm holding but still want to watch the fireworks. Might not be a complete dud.

Well, all it really does is see if 'Winklevoss' or 'Bitcoin' appear on the 'approved' page or disappear from the 'pending' page and then send off a notification via [SNS](
To get it running, you'll need a [Python]( installation along with [Requests]( and [Boto3]( modules as well as an [AWS]( account.
From there, you just have to [set up]( SNS to text and email you, take the ARN generated and copy it into the script. The script runs once, so you'll want to use [cron]( or a while loop inside of some sort of session manager, like [screen](
    $ while true; do ./notify.py; sleep 60; done
Easiest way to get to this point is to spin a GCE or AWS instance if you don't already have a unix box kicking around. One with enough power to run this for the weekend should be cheap.
Edit: I /guess/ I could just add email/phone numbers to the SNS distribution... but if I were you I wouldn't trust me with that data.

You can contact support and they can remove it.

Set the "POST_ONLY" flag on your orders?
@_date: 2011-08-20 16:25:35
This is exactly what I'm wondering.

Yet. 
I'm also a HUGE fan of their AWS-style outage reporting.
