Thanks!! Like I said it's not the actual amount of money given just the fact that someone outside of me actually appreciates what I've done.
A lot of music is time spent alone thinking, arranging, tweaking, sweating, and getting frustrated among other things. The end product is where the relief comes. If you have some sort of following/fan base, that relief comes with commentary, sales, "love", etc.  If you're amateur to the max like I am (I'm a full-time accountant) then you don't get that level of gratification.
I think in a world where technology has driven the cost of production/distribution of music (on the margin) to essentially zero, we tend to under appreciate the human cost and pride at stake. So thanks for recognizing some of it. :)

I know technical analysis is highly controversial, but in the speculation community the $316 level is roughly the end of the 4th wave of the Elliot Wave theory so I think a lot of traders are "band wagoning" the ride to that level or below and then going long.

I know it's sad and sucks that many people (still) trust centralized exchanges to guard the loot, but I'm glad we're "liquidating" and shaking off all the deadweight infrastructure around us.  Smart entrepreneurs will see/learn from the failure and shame the amateurish efforts we have thus seen.
On a similar note, I think personal responsibility for Bitcoins will become way easier. How can you beat a tool like Ledger Wallet (or something similar) for &lt;$100 that doesn't require a PhD in CS to set up?
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:15:47
Deflation in Bitcoin's case is not undesirable.
Just think, Bitcoin as it appreciates will hit a tipping point where people will a. cash out or b.spend the "unrealized" gains (ie having more purchasing power).
In case "a" as the coins are sold, the coins will land in various hands. 1 holder then leads to 1+owners.
In case b the same will eventually happen to.
With a greater dispersment of coins, the likelihood of those coins now being spent is greater.
So deflation will take care of itself.

I don't use/have Xbox but this weekend I was hanging out with a buddy and was telling him how Microsoft now accepted Bitcoin and gave him the elevator pitch description.
We wanted to rent The Interview and I told him I could demonstrate how easy and cool paying with Bitcoin was.
Fast forward a few hours and realized that paying with Bitcoin is a bit of a hassle. I had just assumed that they'd flash a QR code (a la any normal Bitpay purchase) and I'd just pay. Wrong! You have to log on and send money there which is almost pointless if you want to lock in purchasing power then and there and not estimate how much a movie is going to cost in 6 hours.
Anyways, hopefully they make it where you can pay with the method I described.

I can understand many of the Coinbase complaints however, they are fronting you money for 1-2 days when you initiate an "instant buy."
That can be a risky proposition for just about anyone.  I'm sure they don't want to get burned and for them to grow/attract more investors they have to show that they have a handle on such matters.
I'm sure this issue would come up in a due diligence meeting with auditors or an investor.

I'd prefer to to schedule a monthly buy since keeping track of purchases/sales for tax purposes is tedious enough.

I 100% agree but I think having a support of around $70 and average price hovering around that isn't a bad thing. I think we need time to talk about what to do without huge swings and infinite "hold" and "we've hit (name your number)!!" memes.

Deflation as a bad is a myth. People buy "now" because the value of having something now outweighs waiting for a few months or year to buy it. Think of the DVD player. I remember when they were $1000 in the 90's but people still bought them.  Just because you know technology gets cheaper with time doesn't mean you'll wait to buy. Deflation is beneficial because it helps more people buy the good and extends the market base.  
Also, we are experiencing deflation because Bitcoin is PEGGED to all fiat currencies. If we were able to keep books, store value in bitcoins, I guarantee you wouldn't notice it.

While I agree that storage of value is a great utility of money and what attracts many, like me, to Bitcoin, the primary function of money is a medium exchange.  
Money is a product of the barter system.  I want good A, and I have good C but person with good A doesn't want good C.  Good B is desired by most so we use that as an intermediary. 
Important: Bitcoin has already met the medium of exchange function of money.
What makes Bitcoin so unique and causes it to rapidly appreciate is that people are tired of being ripped off/scammed in the stock market, housing market, or their savings account. People actually want to save their money for short, medium, and long term use but cannot get a positive real interest rate.
Bitcoin is in the process of finding that equilibrium where the trade off between present and future is appropriately discounted and priced in the present.
The fact that such a demand is astronomically high (no one alive has experienced a deflating currency, or at least an increase in purchase power in time), price will have to reflect this reality.
 At one point the appreciation of Bitcoin will reach an equilibrium where the rate of appreciation can be reasonably predicted which benefits both savers and merchants.
My two cents: don't worry so much and realize that Bitcoin is filling a desperate need (I fit in that camp) in the market/world.  Keep on supporting merchants but most importantly let's support the overall infrastructure so that when we do have "stability" (in this case reasonable forecasting abilities by users) we can handle the load.
At the moment, the best uses of Bitcoin are international transfers/payments.  I just helped my girlfriend buy a plane ticket to come see me from Europe.  Western Union would have charged me 50% more than what it cost us (and it appreciated in the meantime).  
Conclusion: Let's play to its strengths and recognize weaknesses but know that many weaknesses are because of the frenzied price discovery method in action.
Also, please watch this video:  
You will understand more of where we're going.

Currency's value is it's utility as a medium of exchange. Everything else is a secondary thing. For example, in 3rd world countries the local currency is still used for all transactions even though prices may be quoted in dollars.  The currency as a store of value/unit of account may be shit but it still has the fundamental requriement of currency. Things like gold, silver in past were so successfull because they satisifed a.)MOE by being the most saleabe commodity. 
             b.)Store of Value since gold is not subjected to rapid deflations or inflations in terms of actual purchasing power (not comparing it to USD)
             c.) Unit of Account since one ounce of gold for example was a translatable standard of relative value between all types of goods.
Challenge: Bitcoin obviously satisfies the MOE quality. What the real hinderance is store of vale and unit of account.  Since the Bitcoin universe is so tiny a store of value and unit of account is relatively meaningless since FOREX is such a critical part in 99% of the supply chain.  Bitcoin could do many things from here but until we create depth and better capital markets, Bitcoin will just be I sell you good x which had no value added in terms of Bitcoin (paid for in Dollars,etc along the way). 
Let's invest in Bitcoin and make an island economy in the sea of fiat. Once Bitcoin isn't so heavily dependent on Forex, it'll spread like wild fire.

Just to add, there isn't really a lot to buy yet with Bitcoin. I know the list is pretty substantial but I'm not going to force buy something with it if I really don't have a value for it.  Saving is just deferred consumption. When the right item comes at the right price I'll buy it.

As if Ebay is going to be relevant in a few years.
Ebay was great at first now it's just another stodgy company with nickel and dime fees along the way coupled with PayPal's rip off fees.

Lag is around 5 minutes as I write. The spread will normalize soon so if it dips it'll be momentarily. In any bullmarket there WILL be pullbacks.

Exactly. Strong hands "worry" more about adoption rates, potential flaws in the protocol and perhaps competition. A "crash" (I'll use that term to satisfy our haters) only makes me want to buy more. With more exchanges and transactions, a crash would be quickly consumed since the market has more depth. Take for today I saw a large order go through that drive the price down quickly but the price rapidly gained traction. I also think the maturity level has increased. I actually like all he memes but seeing mess noob behavior also is telling.

@_date: 2013-04-10 20:34:49
We still don't know what that price is. It's still in its infancy so the market is trying to price the present value of Bitcoin.  The speculators just provide more liquidity to the market which we need to keep a tight bid/ask spreak otherwise we will always be at square one with huge gaps between buyers and sellers. Look at any deep market and the spread is in the cents not $50.
@_date: 2013-11-07 16:54:46
Agreed. Expect this run up to continue for some time longer but it'll stabilize above it's moving average.
@_date: 2013-11-07 16:58:27
Fundamentally I agree. However run ups like this don't prevent a lot of "49ers" from thinking this is a new normal and can only go up. A healthy market corrects on the way up. Unfortunately Bitcoin does not have the same liquidity as a NYSE stock so the run ups and corrections become more dramatic. Let's let cooler heads prevail but enjoy the show/ride.

People hedge all the time. One recently popular method is to hedge precious metals' decline with the purchase of Bitcoin.
What's wrong with hedging your Bitcoin position with some shorts until we reach technical support?
Too many people have damn blinders on and only will accept bullish-all-the-time commentary.
I'm long term bullish but recognize some short term downside risk.
It's amazing how many people I know who just recently got interested and are panic selling all their coin. They should've hedged or see the forest for trees.

Of course not but Ebay implements pretty steep fees.
Think of all the overhead involved there as well.
Bitcoin reduces the PayPal fees to virtually nothing so that's some cost savings there.
