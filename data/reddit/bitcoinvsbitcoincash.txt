Coinbase is a criminal institution with a sole purpose of making a profit no matter what. No costumer service to justify the insane amount of money they make. No transparency and  no regard for the hundreds of thousands of costumers slapped with a 30 minute notice : You can trade bcash  .. eh no you can’t !We will see, whatever will be more profitable for us and our friends . But ahem fuck you!

If someone gains your trust then fucks you up is that ok? Just because u didn’t loose money doesn’t mean that others didn’t . or simply put it the way they implemented bcash is either Stupid or criminal. Did you know it will happen today you idiot? Have you watched how the trade went?

Wild West financiers are already day trading Bitcoin. Bitcoin community, structure, technology( block chain) will have to prove itself revolutionary and resilient enough to fight the old paradigm. Bitcoin need to improve and stay the course at the same time (disseminated-  avoiding to follow the fiat path)
Trading is the need and fiat was the answer until now. Getting recognized by mainstream financial institutions will bring more people and more attention to crypto for better or worse. But remember Bitcoin asked for the fight!

Is pertinent to almost all crypto trade. The Asian exchanges set the trend.

Bitcoin having small swings is not creating panic sales. And you can tell that only Bithumb  has hit $8,800 others just watched and followed at a distance. Gdax has a Thanksgiving Day etc. It will be the weekend when we gonna see some swings and moves. But this time around Bcash will not cause the difficulty crisis like last time (have implemented the update). No one wants to crash the crypto games and Bitcoin is still the face of crypto for the “outside” world
