I thought they had finally become accredited and not a reseller a few years ago. I know they didn't switch over from eNom at first, but I thought thy would have by now.

XBT is not arbitrary. It follows ISO rules for naming of currencies. Bitcoin is not associated with a country, thus X is the first symbol. Gold is XAU.
BTC can never be the recognized abbreviation of Bitcoin because it doesn't follow standards, and it's already allocated to another country. If we want to continue furthering this currency, we have to play by some of the rules. These types of rules are there to prevent confusion and to make sure everybody is talking the same language.
BTC is rather arbitrary. You don't have to get your feathers so ruffled up about it.

USD is a code, and people use it. If somebody used a few different letters when they were coming up with that, we would issues those instead of USD.
BTC didn't just appear out of thin air and everybody started using it immediately. Somebody started out, and people use it. Now somebody has started using XBT, and eventually it may be the accepted phrase. It depends on the people.
I think using XBT will only help is. It will show we care about iso standards, it will show that we believe this is a currency and should be treated as such.
Bitcoin is still rather new compared to every other currency. We have a long way to go in a ton of different areas.

I would suggest adding values adjusted for the ratio. It doesn't really compare properly right now.
@_date: 2014-04-18 22:05:56
But what does it affect if we offer the layman XBT? If we all use it, it will also just make sense. That's what I'm trying to say. Common use has made USD the acceptable form, besides the symbol. The same can be done for Bitcoin. I would say it's even rather important to follow standards if we want to continue to push for it to be recognized as a proper currency.
I totally get your stance, I just have a differing opinion. Really I think that Bitcoin might be version 1 of the virtual currency people use. I can see something else coming along that drastically improves how things are done. Stuff nobody has ever thought of before, just like Bitcoin. People will already be warmed up to the idea of virtual currencies and be okay with using something that is easier and better.
The iphone changed phones drastically, bit then android came along. Trains changed transportation, but then we had planes. There's always room for innovation.
What those improvements could be, I don't know. It's definitely not any of the current altcoins, and we probably won't see it for years. But I very much look forward to eventually paying for everything in galactic space credits.

The person receiving it is supposed to report the income and pay taxes on it, but most people probably don't. Not unless that's their job. Even then, some is under-reported.

I'm really liking the game tournaments, scholarship, software bounties, video bounties, and helping bitcointip out. Bitcoin doesn't need traditional advertising, the people who use it right now and for the short future don't really respond to advertising. We need things to get others interested and to take us more seriously. I don't think the money should be returned, I think it should be used. Doesn't have to be quickly. I'm sure you can also get some trusted people in here to help manage some of those ideas sui the mods aren't stuck with more on their to-do list. Obviously they would need to prove their trust and give the mods some identifying information if they wanted to manage any of that.

Problem being, what's in it for the merchant to Give a discount for a payment method? Businesses exist to make money. Perhaps they could offer a discount on the amount that their credit card processing fees would take, but what business would take less money when most will happily pay via another method.
Most retailers at this point will be covering the BTC to their local currency nearly instantly. They're not in the business of speculating on prices, they need that money to replace what you just bought.

I think a better option for those tiny transactions would be a service that compiles those all together to eliminate the dust on the network. Obviously you would have to trust them.
How they could work would be you deposit X into your account with them. When you +1 a site they transfer that amount of XBT to the site's account. This would be done off the blockchain to eliminate dust. When the site accumulates enough, they can withdraw their XBT. Again, you would need to trust them, but these amounts are very small. Trusting them would keep the dust off the blockchain.

The work to doublespend is going to outweigh the benefits of doublespending for a coffee. You also won't have a ton of people doing this (if any). So your losses may be as much as when somebody makes an order wrong and you have to throw it out.

If you really work for coinbase then please hire more support people. Also you should be looking at customer service oriented people. The mechanics of bitcoin can be taught, but not everyone can be taught proper customer service. I know you guys hired a few people recently and that is good. You really don't want to get to a point where people do have to post publicly for every little thing. 
Seriously, just hire customer support oriented people and teach them Bitcoin later. Charge more if you have to. 
Of course I come from a background where the first response to a ticket is within 15 minutes, and resolution usually under an hour unless it is a major problem. Just communicate more. Get some more canned responses for situations like this so people don't feel like they're being ignored. Just a little bit of constant communication can help tremendously.

I think the risk of taking a $10 hit vs the convenience of your customers is worth accepting zero confirmations. You're not going to see many (if any) people going through the trouble of double spending for a meal.

Amundsen-Scott station is at the geographic south pole. Like, you can walk 50 feet to the pole that's been put up (though it's about 100 meters from the actual geographic pole, it's on a moving glacier). The article says he will be arriving to that station, though by sled, not plane.
And by IT, I meant the guys who manage the satellite internet access down there.

Why yes, I do know what the word marketing means. Advertising Bitcoin and the use of it is going to return almost nothing to us. It takes a lot more than just money to make a successful commercial. Even then, you need to be presenting it to the right audience. Somebody who will actually be hooked by your commercial.

I always separate my wallets when going through the airport. I put a current id, ticket, and small amount of cash in a small wallet and carry that. My regular wallet then goes secured in my carryon I have a second type of current id in there. I don't have to worry about losing the wallet I'm carrying or somebody grabbing it from the xray output. Seems one could easily forget to pack your main wallet.

But you don't really pay people in gold. If you're doing actual trading of gold you may likely use the official symbol. Since XBT is now the approved and recognized currency symbol, it would make sense to start using it over BTC. The earlier we do it, the better. If Bitcoin continues to grow there may be an actual need to refer to it as XBT. Then you'll have all kinds of people confused as to the difference between BTC and XBT.

QR code next to each choice, monitor those addresses and use the ouputs to tie in with the existing system. Vend when you get a confirmation (or just trust them) for whichever address they sent to.
I agree on the rpi. A touch screen would not be necessary for this. You also don't need to worry about storing any keys in the machine. You can convert the BTC to your local currency as needed.
If a ton of people start using it, you also start getting a better idea of when to stock it.
Would have to work something out when you're out of stock and they've sent a payment already. Most machines will tell you when you press the button if it is in stock. I wish more would just have an LED next to each item for stock status.

I wrote suggesting they look into using something like bitpay or coinbase if they don't want to deal with keeping and converting Bitcoin themselves. They get more of the money donated and they get people who wouldn't have donated otherwise. I would think there would also be a decent influx off new donations the day they opened them up to Bitcoin.

The problem is that businesses exist to make money, not to further Bitcoin. Most will be nearly instantly converting it to their local currency. They need the cash to replace what you just bought. There are a few though that recognize Bitcoin is awesome and are giving discounts.

That is a terrible assumption. Just because Linux is more secure doesn't mean vulnerabilities aren't targeted with malware. Security issues are found every day, just like with any other OS. The difference is that more people are looking for them and they are usually patched more quickly.

Even more money.
Regular people aren't ready for Bitcoin yet. They'll lose money. We need to continue to appeal to tech savvy people who will help to grow Bitcoin. We need more merchants and more users, but we also need better wallets and security for the average person.
I just don't see a superbowl commercial helping us right now. The first commercial will probably be for a business anyways, so why not let them do it when they are ready?

Unfortunately, right now Bitcoin is not a good place for people who have no idea what they are doing. I just don't think it is a good time for such a commercial.
The Vegas commercials are paid for by casinos. They make a ton of money and want to keep that money coming in. Right now we don't have any casinos, or even businesses worth promoting.
Before broader adoption really happens, it needs to be easy for new people to enter Bitcoin, and easy for new people to keep their funds secure with Bitcoin. Right now we're about the exact opposite of that.

Your comment should not have been downvoted. You have added to the conversation and done so in a civil manner. Those who downvoted you need to have another look at [Reddiquette]( (you were at -3 when I commented).
Here is why I disagree with you:
The risk of a doublespend on a transaction like a coffee is so low that you really don't need to wait for any confirmations. As soon as the transaction is published, give them the coffee. I can't see somebody actually going through the trouble of scamming a few dollars with time that could be spent scamming larger amounts. The amount is also small enough that you can take the hit if it isn't legit.
For larger transactions, it is up to both parties on how long they want to wait for confirmations. If I'm doing thousands of dollars for a transaction, then I have no problem waiting a bit to make sure everything is legit for me and for them.
I don't see the need for transferring such small amounts of money. I usually tip 50c and above. Anything smaller doesn't feel worth it to me. I do agree that the transaction fees need work, but yes this is a high priority item from what I've heard.
In the USA you are considered suspicious whenever you transact large amounts of money. Moreso if it is cash. They don't like you being anonymous. If you had $15,000 in the bank right now that was yours clean and clear, you would still have to fill out a bunch of forms for the bank and the IRS to use it. If police pulled you over for some reason and found it, they would take it and say it was drug money. This happens quite a bit in the USA.
You seem to somewhat agree that the banking system is broken. I think it is almost completely broken. I very much prefer credit unions, but I would prefer Bitcoin even more.
I agree that Bitcoin is being valued far above what it is currently worth. I hope that we can continue to quickly make it worth more though. We are quickly seeing more and more businesses transact in Bitcoin. Even if they immediately convert to their local currency, I still love to see them using Bitcoin. I hope that soon we actually have a few businesses that transact completely in Bitcoin from manufacturing to wholesale to retail.
There are many improvements that can be made in Bitcoin. I think that with so many people using Bitcoin more and more we will see some of these improvements made. The biggest problem right now is making it easy and secure for the layman. We have a long way to go. Bitcoin may not be the "messiah," but it will certainly lead to it.
