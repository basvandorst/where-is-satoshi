Maloney is right most of the time BUT not when he says we will have financial disaster soon. This is misleading people into going all-in into gold which may be great long-term but not so much short-term. Remember the movie „Big Short” the guy had all the pieces right but 3 years too early and almost went bankrupt. Making right investment in the right time is all that matters. People saying „disaster soon” for 10 years have to be treated with a grain of salt.

It’s funny how many people expect another bull market this year, completely forgetting that majority of tech savvy investors are still on a huge loss, buying BTC at 6k fake bottom, not even mentioning those who bought at ATH. Who shall make this bull market then? Institutional investors? I heard these stories once Bitcoin was at 10k then look what happened.

We are the forefront of a major and historical shift. The value that Bitcoin represent to dollar right now may still be important to many but in the long run this is irrelevant. Bitcoin purpose is not to make us more dollars (although it can do that) - it is to free us from a slavery of central banks and their corrupted policies, designed to make poor even poorer so there’s no middle-class anymore to challenge the order. Designed to track and control our financial future. Whoever understands that, understands Bitcoin.

Congratulations for waking up to a giant clusterf**** that is global economy. I wish you the best in your pursuit for knowledge. To understand interest rates first you need to understand what money is. To understand what money is you need to read about monetary history: gold, dollar bills, fractional reserve. Then read about keynesian model of economy. These all pieces will come together at some point and you will feel awaken to an ugly reality, like Neo after taking red pill. Be warned :)

By looking at the chart it is still in a descending channel and something huge needs to happen before it turns into bull market.
Of course saying that BTC will be dropping further makes me downvoted by moonboys, despite the fact that DaVincij15 himself told it is very likely to happen.
Different technicals say opposing things. Some say this is the bottom, some say bottom is below 2k. No one knows for sure what will happen but it is dropping because not that much people are buying it. And it is being mined every day. Support zones being slowly turned into resistance zones should give people idea about the general trend.
@_date: 2019-02-01 12:44:41
You should not be asking why BTC dropped but why did it rise so quickly in the first place.
It was a speculative bubble when „the street” suddenly wakes up to the opportunity of fast and easy money. It happens everywhere, not only in crypto world.
Right now we are in the recovery phase when the value of Bitcoin is being renegotiated after the bubble is gone and we are closer to healthy market.

Money in any form is merely a medium of  exchange between my labour/goods and yours. If the amount of money keeps growing much faster than the amount of actual wealth measured in goods available, then you have so called inflation (of prices) which means actual deflation of purchasing power of money. 
Since 2008 Central banks quadrupled the amount of money circulating in the system and they may continue to do so. Wenezuela scenario for rest of the world is one of few possible outcomes of this. But it won’t start until central banks are ready, they can prolong this game few more years or even decades.

It depends. Deflationary crisis will most likely cause BTC to go lower. Hyperinflationary would more likely move all money into  assets like gold or crypto, like in Wenezuela. Whether the crysis will be deflationary or inflationary depends on FEDs policy. Further low interest rates and inlux of money will lead to hyperinflationary collapse (good for btc) while tightening the policy to stock market collapse and massive slowdown (negative / neutral for btc)
@_date: 2019-02-05 11:49:33

Deflationary financial system would be an enemy of consumption because it promotes saving instead of spending.

Very interesting read. Thank you.

Current financial system based on fiat is a legal theft. Bitcoin has the power to change it. However I’m afraid that big boys from bank elite won’t let it be. Nothing that challenges their biggest instrument of power: US Dollar can survive intact. They destroyed whole countries which did not want to trade for Dollars, they suppresed the price of sound money like gold and silver. I don’t want the same happen to Bitcoin but it is a possibility. The only way it won’t happen is a total economic collapse coming before they take btc out.

@_date: 2019-01-22 14:43:02
The easiest way to assume what can happen with BTC after ETFs and Futures get through is to look what happens to gold, a deflationary and superior contender to US dollar. 
The amount of contracts for gold hugely overwhelms the amount of actual physical gold that has been mined. The false gold supply that exist only on paper keeps the price of gold supressed. Whole supply/demand law is being overwritten.
Same can happen to BTC especially if it’s considered a threat to Dollar.

You’re right. There’s no 100% bulletproof investment. It takes time and effort to do a proper research and choose wisely. That’s why most people don’t bother even if they know about inflation (surprisingly most adults don’t even know what inflation stems from).
Investing in fiat gives a 100% guarantee we lose money. Other investments at least give a chance to break even or make a profit.

@_date: 2019-01-22 21:15:09
I know how this works for silver. In theory you can require for a physical asset to be delivered but very few people do so. As a result the exchanges can sell paper silver to much more people that allows the amount of silver available. Result is a super low price because there is infinite supply created on paper. 
Works the same way like fractional reserve for banks so they are allowed to actually own only a small portion of money people give to them, rest they lend out for profit. This lie keeps going until all people want their stuff at once, which ofc nover happens.
@_date: 2019-01-22 20:52:45
Maybe I didn’t make myself very clear. It is like putting your money into stock shares of a company which drops in value few percents every year. I bet no one reasonable would do that.

@_date: 2019-01-18 10:47:53
Gold price skyrocketed after the recession like it always does. When you see price of gold increasing over the years remember that dollar gets inflated all the time so in the long run it’s not gold that gets more expensive, it’s the dollar getting cheaper.
@_date: 2019-01-18 09:22:23
I’m not an expert by any means but I’m hugely skeptical towards things like Futures or ETFs for Bitcoin. These are instruments to manipulate the markets and when Bitcoin is considered a real threat to the system, they can easily bring it down, using these tools. 
Let’s look at the gold for example, which is another threat to fiat money system because it’s deflationary. Gold prices have been suppresed so much its cost is barely higher than the average cost of mining it. Actual gold price is over 90% market manipulation and less than 10% actual physical demand. This keeps the price low despite huge demand from Asia and private investors for physical gold. Same can happen to BTC in my opinion.

Once you know what inflation is you don't really have much choice. It's either gold or crypto. Fiat is losing buying power too fast. The number of ordinary people realizing this is growing.

Both gold and Bitcoin have their advantages. That’s why it is wise to keep a little bit of both. I see a lot of arguing gold vs Bitcoin on the Internet, which I find ridiculous.
Bitcoin’s reliance on power supply and network is the cause it can never replace gold. But it can be very useful where the gold can’t.

Big players are unloading their Tether before US court orders to shut Tether down imo.

Live my life exactly the same but having my future financially secured.

Yeah, what Nixon did was the cause of extremely fast growth in the economy for the upcoming decades but had one little tiny irrelevant flaw: it wasn't sustainable because one cannot build wealth on debt infinitely. But people who invented this did not plan on living long enough to see the sorry consequences.

Sounds great mate! :) Can you name some please?
@_date: 2019-05-07 15:31:56
Yes we do and hopefully Bitcoin will be up to the task.

There are two choices: sell lots of paper unbacked Bitcoin contracts via Futures to contain the price and stop the bubble (same they are doing with gold) or try to ban it. Or both. 
Once Bitcoin is understood as a serious threat to USD there will be no mercy.

Nice, cheers mate!

I know man. I take a contrarian view on everything mainstream media are feeding us with. Kudos!

You made me to order Ledger to secure my petty 1/3rd of Bitcoin. Congratz.

Yeah mate. Speaking for myself, even though I knew about inflation for a long time I didn't really care until recently. You can hear in tv or read in a paper "inflation this, inflation that, inflation went to 2%" but no one really cares because they think it's so small it's negligible. The rate of real inflation is closer to 10% a year so this should really scare the shit out of anyone who saves money. When I realized the real rate it made me think more about the financial system we live in. And it's like this in most countries in the world.
They want us to buy, to spend, to take cheap credits, to give them money for some petty return rate or to play stock markets and be swallowed by big players like bankers. Most of the options available are bad to our money.

Good advice man. But what about the price. Will it rise?
@_date: 2019-05-23 15:50:09
Sell everything I have to buy Bitcoin. I need to have solid confirmation about bullish momentum before I buy. 100k price seems solid.

Thank you for this link, mate :)
It's pretty strange to have this discussion when one of the guys says Bitcoin is useless and the other says the same about gold. While both BTC and gold should be very important to anyone who understands the lunacy of Keynesian economic model.
