No, because that energy is being used to create value. Extremely efficiently compared to other ways of creating value. Do the comparison against mining gold or drilling for oil or printing dollars.
Note that bitcoin can be mined with any electricity, including renewable and extremely cheap sources because it is not location dependent and doesn't need to rely on a continuous energy source.
Finally, note that as the price of bitcoin goes up, all the bitcoin that was mined previously was mined for cheaper than it is now worth.

@_date: 2015-06-19 21:00:07
My thoughts exactly. I figured the guy who took the loan would have no problem paying him back because the actual value of 11.95 BTC in USD is lower now. So I was surprised when they said he had to pay back the amount that the BTC was worth in USD when the loan was issued. It seems like a bizarre arbitrary choice.
@_date: 2015-06-01 20:16:18
I didn't say or imply that it would. I'm just pointing out that it's hard to do the calculations now since we don't have the numbers on how much these things will cost that far in the future when 7 billion people are actually using bitcoin every day.

I explained why you were being naive by showing that your argument was illogical and inconsistent. You made a claim that gold is better than bitcoin, by listing properties of gold and saying nothing of the properties of bitcoin. That is clearly illogical and inconsistent. So I *did* actually add to the discussion. What part of that don't you understand?
Then you tried to change the subject by suggesting that my not talking about how awesome gold is is somehow relevant to what you said. It's not. You have no idea how to argue, and everyone here is laughing at you. Please get a fucking clue.

Of course, there is never any guarantee that a transaction will get into the next block no matter how high the included fee. Maybe they should give an estimated fee to get in with a, say, 90% probability?

Pricing things in say USD is currently necessary because USD is more stable than bitcoin. If all the fiat currencies go away, and bitcoin is the most popular currency left, it will be the most stable and there will be no issue pricing things in bitcoin.

I agree it doesn't have the same advantages as a decentralized coin like bitcoin, but that doesn't mean it's not useful at all. Currently the major issue in acquiring bitcoins is that no one has control over their own fiat to get it onto an exchange so that they can trade it for bitcoins. If a government-backed crypto happens, that problem vanishes. Don't you see how that would be a good thing?

TRADING FEES REDUCED BY OVER 50%!
The Bitcoin exchange business is rapidly growing around the world. To stay competitive we are drastically reducing our fees! Unlike other exchanges, we give you credit for 120 days of BTC volume, not just 30, so if you trade 100 BTC and 3 months pass, you would still qualify for our second fee level of 0.6%! Our new fee structure is now live at 
120 Day BTC Volume - Fee
Less than 100 0.75%
Less than 200 0.6%
Less than 300 0.5%
Less than 400 0.4%
Less than 600 0.3%

The original X is already going to the miners. You make it seem like the extra X going to the miners would make the miners somehow extra greedy.
Secondly, the miners' power is to determine the longest chain among a given fork. But it's the users who determine which fork is valid. In other words, if 51% of the hashing power all of a sudden decides to validate some new reward system, thereby creating a fork, they still have to convince all the users (other nodes on the network) to see that new fork as valid.

No. Arbitrage is left up to the users.
Edit: An exchange could also do arbitrage, but they are essentially no different from an arbitrary user in this sense. Furthermore, being a business, they are likely focusing on their own operations and not taking advantage of arbitrage opportunities.

Electricity costs vary depending on location and technology. In some places the answer is yes, it already has, and yes, this is exactly the reason people stop mining when they do. In other places, electricity is cheaper or even free. Globally, people will never stop mining as long as the price of bitcoin is non-zero.

Why would the supply of bitcoin decrease? Only through loss? If so, one might expect the same expected loss of one's own coins, which provides the incentive for buying things with them before they get lost.

If you're mining at a loss (i.e. it costs more in electricity than the revenue you expect to get) then I'd say what you're doing is not only bad for bitcoin (as it will lower the price) but also bad for the environment.

To be somewhat generous, I think what she meant is that that strategy is a good way to find a needle in a haystack; not that it's proof. Her proof was the guy's apparent "admission", which she seems to have misinterpreted. Still, it does come across as extremely naive the way she put it. Not to mention that while it may work in some cases, it's not likely you'll find the real Satoshi this way.

Let's say people predict that the price will go down until one month before the halving, at which point it will start going up again. Then why would they buy now, instead of waiting until the actual event?

You have a photo of someone, but you don't know the identity. Someone anonymously supplies you the name. You then use the name to look in your national database, find the corresponding photo, and compare them. Obviously, this is a simplistic example, as spy agencies have better tools, but I'm just demonstrating the principle. By the way, I was also thinking of hashing - you have someone's public bitcoin address, but not their private key. Or you know who Satoshi is - and tell the FBI his identity and they go to his house and find his private keys thus verifying it's him, etc.

While I personally hate the "bits" unit, and am perfectly comfortable using SI prefixes such as mBTC and μBTC, I think your experiments are biased (in favour of the current situation):
Current situation is that BTC is the most commonly used unit, so that makes it easier to understand *currently* and thus more likely that users will *currently* prefer it. However, if the situation changes so that another unit becomes more common, then you may rerun your experiment and find a different result.
TL;DR Your experiment proves that people are resistant to change, but it doesn't necessarily mean that such change is detrimental.

Remittance is not exchanging currencies.
Remittance is earning money in one country and sending it to your family in another country. What part of that will be made obsolete by bitcoin? Countries? Travelling to a different country for a job? Wealth  disparity between them?

By mixing I mean sending colored coins to a bitcoin address with non-colored coins already residing in it.
Edit: I am taking your statement "your colored coins become uncolored" as the answer to the question I meant to ask. I guess my worry is that it would be too easy to lose value (represented by colored coins) this way. Say the colored coins in question represent X amount of stock in say Google. Now that those coins got mixed up with noncolored coins, they no longer represent that stock? And in fact that stock is no longer owned by anyone?

Can you explain this a bit better? I am a mathematician so I should be able to figure it out, but I didn't see the number 21 million anywhere in your link, nor can I guess where it comes from.
I have heard something like this said before, but I believe it was in reference to why bitcoins were chosen to be divisible down to the satoshi (i.e. 10^-8 BTC. If that is really what you are referring to, then it has nothing to do with why Satoshi chose 21 million total instead of 20 million total.

Great argument. Now apply the same argument to the 1 MB cap. 
"What makes that person proposal of 1MB any different than a proposal of 8GB? At least the fake 8GB proposal isn't arbitrary. They are picking 1MB because "It's one times as much as the current value, which by the way is clearly not working very well""
Oh right. The 1 MB cap is arbitrary too. In fact it's even more arbitrary than 2MB because at least with 2MB, Bitcoin would be usable *right now*, whereas with 1 MB it's clearly having problems.

Not necessarily the wrong person, but maybe the wrong amount.
Back when US bills were all the same colour (it wasn't too long ago) some waitress gave me the wrong denomination as change. Not an ideal example, because she probably never would have noticed, but presumably this can happen quite a lot (I guess that's why they introduced different colours). And it may be easy to notice after you check what you have left if you're actually paying attention to the total in your wallet. Maybe a little far-fetched, but certainly possible.

Just to be clear, we're not talking about miner profitability, we're talking about usability for the bitcoin user=, in terms of how effective bitcoin is at making trasactions, ie. how high is the fee they need for a given expected confirmation time. Right now that is the usability isuue.
Your reply is about how much work a miner would have to do to stay profitable. If he doesn't stay profitable he can drop out, and if many miners drop out the difficulty will drop, and the remaining miners will soldier on. Usability will only be affected if this causes a security issue. Will it? You haven't made that point.

I'd like to see the difficulty get updated more often (possibly every block), but still based on the time taken for the previous 2016 blocks to get mined. I don't see any problems this would cause (apart from the time taken for 2016 blocks to happen to be way closer to the intended 2 weeks than it currently is, so overall we'd be creating bitcoins probably at a slightly slower - but in any case far more predictable - rate), and it would mean that the hashrate and mining economics would be far more predictable and stable. Miners on the edge of profitability wouldn't have to keep switching on and off at the difficulty changes, etc. I guess that 51% would be more difficult too.
Anyway, if it's not entirely obvious that this would be a good thing, I think it at least merits discussion.
I'm not much of a github user, so if someone else agrees and has the inclination maybe they can add this for me.

Your whole reply is about security, i.e. attackers. I don't disagree that there wouldn't be much difference in this respect. But you completely ignored the main point, namely usability.

I'm saying this is the argument. If you want to claim that I'm wrong in my argument, you need to provide a counterargument.
@_date: 2016-01-14 23:55:49
I can't find any such reasoning in the literature. I did find [this](


But I reject that argument. Mining would still be profitable under a continually adjusting difficulty. If it wasn't, miners would stop hashing, and the difficulty would drop until it became profitable again. Maybe there would be less easy profits mining because you wouldn't have these vast stretches (relatively speaking) where new more efficient/profitable mining hardware has been added to the network and the difficulty takes two weeks to catch up. So you might not have massively profitable mining companies developing monopolies etc. I fail to see how that would be a bad thing. Only good, as far as I can tell.
Conclusion: if you have evidence for your claim, please provide it. Otherwise I feel your claim is on shaky ground.
@_date: 2015-05-22 20:25:20
I thought so too, but I wasn't sure. Then I did the math. You're wrong.
300 VEF = 1USD means 1 VEF = 1/300 USD = .003333 USD
402 VEF = 1USD means 1 VEF = 1/402 USD = .002488 USD
The percentage change is defined as 
pct_change = (new_value - old value)/old_value x 100%
Plug in the values:
(.003333 - .002488) / .00333 x 100% = -25.37 %
I can see why you're confused, because if the USD increased from 300 VEF to 402 VEF that would indeed be a &gt; 33.33 increase in its value relative to VEF. But increases and decreases don't work the same way.
This stuff is always confusing, even for a professional mathematician like me. One way to make it easier is this: *The percentage change is always a smaller number when it goes down by a certain factor, rather than going up by that same factor.* (Example, a doubling is a 100% increase, but when the value drops in half it's only a 50% decrease.)
Edit: got "smaller" and "bigger" mixed up. Thanks @_date: 2016-03-03 20:14:30


Everything in your reply is about the amount of work a miner needs to do. How is that relevant except inasmuch as it affects their profitability? You seem to be saying that a miner who has too much work to do will somehow avoid doing that work. My claim is this means they will collect less fees and therefore be less profitable than a miner who is capable of confirming those transactions, and these less profitable miners will drop out, and the apparent problem will resolve itself.
Why isn't confirming the transactions in a given block a relatively insignificant part of a miner's work anyway, due to economies of scale?
Edit: In summary you seem to be saying that some miners will be unable to do the 4x as much work necessary to fill 2x bigger blocks. Wouldn't that just mean they are setting their own soft-cap on the blocksize? Why is this a problem?

I meant the time you are choosing to measure from. The point is, choosing the time when your asset *was worth $0 by definition* and comparing the value then to the value now is not a very useful comparison.
It's not at all akin to an IPO, because when an IPO is offered, you are selling something that the market agrees already has value. At the time of the IPO it already has value, otherwise there would be no IPO.

That's interesting. So when the marketcap of Bitcoin went from $1 billion to $10 billion (approximately) in the span of a couple months in late 2013, (and we now know that there's a very good chance this was mainly the result of uninformed speculation triggered by the willybot), how can you say this value didn't come from nothing? Where did it come from then? 
Remember "investors putting money into bitcoin by buying it" are completely balanced by "investors taking money out of bitcoin by selling it". So, where did that value come from?

Exactly. Some hardware that was previously too inefficient will come back online immediately, but not enough to make up for the difference, because the total amount of hashrate that was previously offline and between 70% and 100% effective at recovering cost is probably less than 30% of the total profitable hashrate. Maybe it was 5%, since the hashrate has gone up by that much.
I'm sort of speculating about the numbers, but I hope you get the idea.

You can make a somewhat educated guess by checking the order books on various exchanges. That allows you to see how many bitcoins someone would have to sell for the price to drop below $360. Of course, take this with a grain of salt because the order books are constantly changing, don't always reflect reality (someone can remove a huge order as soon as the price gets close), and also the exchanges don't represent the whole market.

I don't see how that's the creation of money per se. It sounds more like the creation of an IOU. In other words, just because the bank has an internal account that says their customer has "x dollars", I don't think it means that money actually exists.
@_date: 2015-04-20 14:01:17
Sure, in some cases. In this case the amount of extra complexity is insignificant and the change would provide a noticeable benefit - more stability in the mining sector.
@_date: 2015-04-20 21:46:14
I'd say that's a simplification. To quote from the same article:


essentially IOUs from commercial banks to households and
companies — and currency — mostly IOUs from the central
This agrees with what I said above. Bank deposits are IOUs, not actual money per se. Only currency is actual money. This is a semantic issue for sure, but I'd say my interpretation would be the one that most would agree with.
I'd say the decider is the fact the banks can run out of money and require bailouts as we have seen. How could this happen if they  can simply create it by changing some numbers in their ledger? It's because when they "create money" by loaning it to people, they need to account for that by sticking a debit in their own column.

All other things being equal, when the rate of monetary inflation is less than the rate of growth of the economy. The monetary inflation of bitcoin is currently roughly 10%, and it gets halved once every 4 years, with the next halving near the end of July next year. So it will be economically deflationary in another 10-15 years or so. Of course, the price may not reflect that, as it is also dependent on other things, not just how deflationary bitcoin is.

The inflation rate (left axis) also depends on how fast blocks are being found. If it's faster than 10 minutes per, than the inflation rate will be higher than you calculated. For example, if hash rate keeps increasing at a steady rate so that average block times are at 9 minutes instead of 10, the annual inflation rate at that particular time (ie. number of blocks) would be 10/9ths of what it shows on your chart.
@_date: 2015-10-13 22:33:11
Presumably the argument against increasing the blocksize when bitcoin is busy is the same as the argument against increasing it at any other time. Why do you think this problem would go away just because bitcoin is 'busy'?

What are you smoking? In 5 years (after two more halvings) it'll be roughly 2%, and it'll take another 4 years after that to get to less than 1%. I'm looking at the same graph you're looking at.
@_date: 2015-10-06 17:03:12
OK, I just wanted to make it clear.
@_date: 2015-03-05 21:53:12
The US marshals? You make it sound like if they just would have waited a few hours they would have got a better price (i.e. not taking into account that the price was depressed precisely because of the auction). Of course, they might have got a *slightly* better price just due to the overall trend we're in, but not the $50 spike you're referring to. At least that's my simplistic analysis.
@_date: 2015-10-29 19:10:23
Far more people have a lower cost basis than $1000+ . If we make it that far, it means got past them trying to get out first. The people selling at $1000 will be a smaller obstacle.
@_date: 2015-03-09 15:22:01
And the same argument applies to everything else to a certain extent, which is the point. And that's why people will continue to spend in a deflationary environment. Much more than johnstarks13 will admit.

If the price stays the same, probably a lot of miners will stop and the difficulty will go down. If the price rises substantially, the difficulty could go up as more mining happens.

Yes, in approximately 5 years, to be precise after the third halving at block 630, it will be very close to 2%, maybe 1.9% or something. OP said **less than 1%** though.

And rational people, knowing that this might happen, will want to get in there before it does. Rational doesn't always mean determining the optimal price of bitcoin and start trading like it's already that price. It can also mean guessing what other people are going to do before they do it, and behaving accordingly.

And I'm pointing out that this is just your opinion, and there is no official objective criteria that would make it so, like you claimed with the "supposed to be" terminology.
I mean, I could claim that bitcoin's value is supposed to be at $10,000 USD right now, and list off all of bitcoin's awesome features to justify it, but it would be meaningless to do so, because the evidence is that that's not it's current value, and that's the only thing that matters.
@_date: 2015-02-20 19:27:57


Actually, technically that ratio should be 0. Or not. Really, no one has any clue. Why do you think there is some value it's "supposed to be"?
@_date: 2015-02-02 22:22:09
After the next halving the reward will be 12.5 BTC. And after another 4 halvings (in roughly 17 years) the reward will drop below 1 BTC.
@_date: 2015-02-27 22:34:55
I think it's great if such machines would do this. However, until Bitcoin takes over, there will be people that want their change in pennies (or whatever). So really, until then, you'd have to provide for both options.

It doesn't seem to be the case here, but in the past at least, sometimes blockchain.info simply failed to report the finding of a block for a while.

Depends on the nature of the asset. They'd certainly be more unstable with a smaller marketcap. If you don't think that's a rule of economics, you probably don't know any economics. For example, silver has a smaller marketcap - from the wikipedia page for silver: "Compared to gold, the silver price is notoriously volatile. This is because of lower market liquidity, and demand fluctuations between industrial and store of value uses. At times this can cause wide ranging valuations in the market, creating volatility.[6]" Now obviously market liquidity is not the same thing as market cap, but they are positively correlated.

That'll cost you roughly 46 cents at today's prices. Any more than that, and you have more than your fair share. Of course, I'd suggest getting more, because why not, it's currently so cheap to get more than your fair share.

@_date: 2013-11-18 21:36:59
My guess is that it may be partly due to which exchange is lagging more. CaVirtex was lagging hard which made it appear to be about $100 too low for about 15 minutes.

When you say you purchased bitcoins, how did that happen technically? Did the seller send them to an address that you generated yourself? If so, how did you generate that address?
@_date: 2013-12-17 22:07:29
Agree with the sentiment to an extent (although I doubt it would recover to 50% so quickly), but your numbers are a bit off. Current estimate is that Satoshi might have roughly 1 million BTC, not 1000. 1000 BTC gets sold in a span of a few minutes quite often, and it usually sends the price down by 5% or so. 1 million would be rather more dramatic, more like the effects you describe.

I agree with the OP, and would add this: $1.234 per mBTC is harder to parse than $1234 per BTC. The stuff after the decimal point seems less relevant somehow than the $ 234 after the $1000.
That said, I'm all for having the option, and to the extent that it helps drive adoption (even though it may be because others may see things differently) I guess it must be a good thing.
Here's a though though: What happens if and when bitcoin crashes to 50 cents per mBTC? People are going to freak out, saying it's worthless, sellsellsell! When in fact, at $500 per BTC, it still looks like a pretty strong currency.
I guess I'm saying the psychology goes both ways.

However, percentage-wise the Chinese price dipped much less (4%) than US price (10%). So while Westerners might have been more concerned about the US debt deal, the Chinese speculators are ramping up the price for other reasons. And they seem to be the main driver of the price recently.

~~This is supposed to be about how many they have, yes.~~ This is about double what they are known to have.
Edit: (I was confusing ~1% of existing coins (which they have) vs. ~1% of the upper limit of the number of bitcoins that can ever be produced (which is what this is). Of course, they may well have acquired more than what they initially announced.
