Yes, compared to the amazingly long average life span of a cryptocurrency...

This is great and needs to be adopted by the rest of the community! It encourages tipping in the same way as Dogecoin since people feel better owning whole numbers of something!
Also, we could use the symbol ƀ to represent it! Let's make this work!

It's still at our office as of now. We usually let people use it whenever we host Bitcoin events in Stockholm. Hopefully we can get it into some mall in the future. :-)

I've bought one of each, they're pretty awesome!

This is why we need the "bits" (ƀ)
I really like that suggestion. 13 million bits sounds a lot more impressing. :-)

Very good point! 
Besides, western countries are anyway in desperate need to start saving and investing, instead of more of that Keynesian crap. :-)

I see some problems with it (correct me if I'm wrong though). But if the side-chain peg has to be fixed, then it seems like it wouldn't be very advantageous to have stocks or bonds as side chains since you wouldn't be able to speculate on the price in BTC?

It's not. It's a gif with the wrong name. Luckily, your browser is smart enough to know that. :)

One thing that's nice is that Safello never actually stores your bitcoins. They're sent directly to your own wallet every time you make a purchase, which is different compared to what most exchanges do.
@_date: 2015-01-29 08:00:52
The block chain is amazing. :')
@_date: 2014-04-08 11:53:47
Despite some negative news about Bitcoin recently, let's not forget how truly groundbreaking this technology is. This is as big as the internet itself, and the media's reactions are a proof of it.
@_date: 2016-06-22 21:45:34
Oh, that's my video! Thanks for sharing! :D
The threads from last year kept getting deleted...

I have to disagree with Andreas here. It's very normal for new ground-breaking technologies to have names that refer to older technologies in order not to scare people away.
It's something professional software companies do all the time. Take Photoshop for example. You have a *canvas*, *brushes*, a *stamp*, a *paint bucket*... etc. Even though these digital tools work quite differently from their "real" counterparts, it makes people more comfortable because it's easy to make a connection.
A *wallet* is something you're already familiar with and know how to use. Referring to your bitcoins as accessible through a "digital wallet" therefore doesn't sound nearly as daunting as accessing them through a *decentralized, cryptographically secured keychain store*.

I'm not sure it can be done, at least not without some "hacks". From what I can see in their SDK, you can only send images, videos and audio clips, not really arbitrary data.

Seriously, if I was going to publicly criticize something, I would first make sure that I actually knew enough about the subject. 
Mallaby obviously has no understanding of Open Source software and distributed systems, and how different that is compared to "an anonymous hacker issuing his own money".
@_date: 2015-02-19 07:14:09
Yay, bits!
@_date: 2013-12-31 10:42:04
I think you're seeing bitcoin as only a virtual currency, and not as a network. What gives bitcoin its true value is the incredibly powerful and growing network behind it, not just the algorithms by themselves.  
I can illustrate this with an example based on another industry: social networks. I could easily replicate the Snapchat code and release my own "Snapchat"-clone for mobile phones. Does that mean that I'm providing the same value as Snapchat? No way! Because the value lies in the network, not the technology. 
Bitcoin is so far ahead in this aspect compared to any other cryptocurrency that I don't really think altcoins have a chance unless they are radically different and offer something completely new! I can't wait to see how it will play out in the future though!
