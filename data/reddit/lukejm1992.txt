Massive tune! The version featuring Kennedy Jones is my favourite.

Really? I mean, I’m big into crypto...but really? Bitcoin by its very nature is finite. One could say digital currency will be around for a while, but that really where it ends. Bitcoin and it’s technology are becoming vastly inferior on all fronts. At this point people are really interested in Bitcoin the name. Technologies come and go, faster than stocks typically do.
I say all of this as a bitcoin owner and crypto enthusiast but this blind following of technologies that get the most media attention is not how we’re are going to help people accumulate wealth and actually use these technologies for the improvement of society. To say crypto is a better investment than traditional stocks is just ignorant. 
You want long term value? Invest in water, real estate and cemeteries. It’s really that simple.

It blows my mind how blind people are to this. It’s happened countless times already yet every time things turn green the MOON memes come out to play. Cryptocurrencies are are great for the world we are becoming, but god damn is it teaching us shitty investment strategies.

But why Bitcoin? I of course own some and am absolutely hopeful it’s value increases, but what does Bitcoin do that other crypto currencies aren’t already doing better? I get the first to market thing - which is of course huge, but other than that, I see many other “more disruptive” technologies out there that go far beyond the standard “store of value” tale.
