Reported it to the registrar (Namecheap). Hopefully they'll cancel the domain to prevent it being used to scam people.
I hate Butterfly labs as much as the next guy (they cost me about $100K in lost profit), but the more we can do to try and reduce the number of times "scam" and "bitcoin" are associated, the better.

In the last 10 days I sent 5 transactions from gox, 3 made it and 2 failed. 
ZERO response from gox on multiple support tickets, even after 10 days. It looks like 2.5 of my BTC have just vanished into the ether, and I doubt gox has any intent of returning them.
GET OUT WHILE YOU STILL CAN!!!
They just screwed up ANOTHER transaction. I am SO done with this site!

Actually, the CEO of FedEx used this strategy to save the company, winning enough money at blackjack to in Atlantic City to allow the company to continue operations.
When asked about it in an interview, his response was: "100% chance of failure, tiny chance of success".

BFL has been announcing that they'll "have all orders caught up in the next 30 days" for the past 120 days. It's impossible to get an honest answer out of that company.

They probably wouldn't as long as you're ordering a large enough quantity of parts to make it worth their time. 
Modern fabs run like print shops for chips. They have a certain amount of set-up for a run (called the NRE or non refundable engineering) and then the per-wafer cost after that.
If you can cover it, yes, they'll work with you.

BFL has failed so many times and taken so long to ship a product, the world has moved on without them.
Why lay down thousands of dollars on hardware that may arrive so late it risks being irrelevant, when you can buy shares in ASICMINER, which are held in bitcoin, and are currently paying 50%+ a year just in dividends?
And even if you *want* hardware, Avalon is shipping huge numbers of ASIC in a couple of months that work as advertised, and have already released reference designs.

Ouch! You can just *hear* the poor dude's dreams getting crushed as the guy in the first post lays it out for him
Seller: "I paid 55BTC for it, so the minimum I'll accept is 55BTC"
Dude: "It's mathematically impossible for it to earn more than 50BTC over its entire lifetime at the average difficulty growth rate, and likely it will earn less than 30. I'll offer you 25".

Well at this point we instantly know they were lying about (or haven't calculated) the board's power consumption, despite claiming it was "350 Watts", because:
A) Those two 6-pin connectors can do a maximum of 300 Watts
B) If they pulled the remaining 50W from the backplane they wouldn't be able to put more than 2 or 3 cards in the machine, despite them claiming to be able to load 6+ cards into a machine.
This is classic BFL making up imaginary specs for a product that doesn't exist, *just like last time*. 
They were showing off "prototype boards" *just like this one* for the BFL "single" miner in July 2012, and it took them until July 2013 to get a single unit into production.

OMG this video is fucking *magnificent*! Nice work OP!

Looks like a good start. 
Based on the photo, its a very conservative design. As they mention in their write-up this will give them a lot of headroom to play in if they have more thermal dissipation than they expected. The pre-packaged power converters are a good call, and will eliminate a lot of problems that can crop up with switching power supplies.
The next questions to ask are:
* Has this been powered-up yet?
* Has it been tested under load using a simulated chip?
Also, is this just a PSU test board?
* Where is the board's main clock module?
* Where is the board's controller and com interface? They're not going to run something like that on an 8-pin microcontroller, which is the largest package on the board besides the ASICs.
* About 4 months away from "ready" if this is just a PSU test board.
* About 2 months away from "ready" if they have all of the above points up and running and are just waiting on the ASICs.

Doing business with Butterfly Labs is like dating a hot girl with a heroin habit.
Everything starts off well, then they...
1) Borrow thousands of dollars from you
2) Promise to pay you back 'in two weeks' for an entire year
3) Sleep around with other guys (
4) Then show up at your door one night saying they'll pay you ten times the original money back if you can just loan them another four thousand dollars for a couple of months.
Anyone can get suckered once, but if you loan them *more* money after seeing what happened the first time, you're a fucking *idiot*.
THE ASIC
It took BFL 14 months from when they started taking pre-orders for their ASIC line to when they finally started shipping them in any kind of volume to real customers. In terms of actual ASICs shipped (Jalapenos take one chip, Singles take 12 chips, Mini Rigs take hundreds of chips), they're still less than 10% through their backlog.
During this epic delay, two of BFL's competitors (Avalon and ASIC Miner) got their designs finished in less than half the time, then flooded the market with ASICs, absolutely crushing BFL.
Avalon and ASIC Miner both have 28nm designs in progress. At least three new companies have also entered the ASIC market, and all of them claim to have 28nm designs in progress. One of these companies has substantial Silicon Valley venture capital behind it and former Intel chip designers on its team
And another has already demonstrated a working prototype
What this means is, from a "getting the ASIC built" perspective, its *almost guaranteed* that another company will be shipping 28nm products before BFL. Its *very likely* that another company will ship 4 to 6 months ahead of BFL, negating a huge portion of the BFL units' ROI.
THE HARDWARE
Butterfly Labs *sucks* at making hardware. Their designs look beautiful in promo photos, but the actual build quality is terrible. Users have been experiencing major reliability issues in production.
The fact that people are reporting significant amounts of "DOA" (dead on arrival) hardware means BFL probably isn't testing units before they ship them out.
BFL has consistently demonstrated utter incompetence throughout their hardware design process. 
Right out of the gate, BFL's ASICs ended up using 3 times their projected power draw, forcing a complete redesign of all of BFL's boards.
Following this, had show-stopping problems with signal routing, voltage regulators, cooling, and practically every other subsystem in the design. Since all the design work was done by off-shore contractors, this caused massive delays in reaching a working prototype; and many of these problems would never have happened in the first place if they had used more skilled designers.
When BFL finally did get their hardware into production, they regularly ran-out of critical parts like circuit boards and power supplies. This caused major delays in getting units to customers.
BFL claims their new 28nm card will have a power draw of 350 Watts, which puts it squarely in AMD 6990 territory.
In case you're new to Bitcoin mining, 6990's run at pretty much the thermal limit for a PCI card. They come with scary warnings about damaging your system's motherboard and power supply, and have a dedicated "all bets are off if you flip this" switch on the back of the board used to enable "full power" mode. The 6990 was a difficult project even for AMD, and has had significant problems with reliability, especially in bitcoin mining applications. 
The fact that BFL is planning to build hardware that runs at this temperature and power density is, frankly, terrifying. 
A PCI card is a very different environment than an external box that plugs in via USB. They'll be up against all sorts of nasty power, signal timing, and compatibility issues. If a card fails hard, it could easily take-out the motherboard, and destroy other cards plugged in to it.
Its *highly* likely the finished product won't have anywhere near the hashing power BFL claims it will, and its *almost guaranteed* that BFL will run into epic delays during design and manufacturing, just like last time.
Within the next few months, there will be plenty of better, cheaper, 28nm ASIC mining rigs. They'll be real hardware that actually exists, and they'll ship on reasonable schedules.
Save yourself a world of hurt and don't send BFL your money.

This photo has either been **badly** photoshopped or there is something seriously wrong with the capacitors in the upper-right corner below the 6-pin PCI connectors. 
It looks like they've been cut in half!

Our Jalapeno was dead-on-arrival too. Emailed them twice. Its been *ten days*, still no response. 
At this rate, it won't even be worth spending the money to ship the unit back to them for a replacement, because it won't earn the shipping costs back.
I am never, EVER buying hardware from BFL again.

Okay, so I post my thoughts on the design. Then krillcoin posts saying I'm full of crap for missing the FPGA point in the article, then you post saying krillcoin is full of crap for missing the comment about the FPGA drawing the same amount of power.
Summary: The prototype board is coming along nicely. Their write-up could probably use some work ...lol

Actually, *unless its a quote from somewhere* bookshelfwaterreplay is a relatively strong passphrase.
"typewriter51" has *maybe* 24 bits of entropy. "bookshelfwaterreplay" has about 44 bits of entropy.
The reason seemingly secure passwords like "to be or not to be" are almost instantly cracked is because they're on a list of "well known phrases". There are perhaps a million of these in the entire human knowledge base, translating to 20 bits of entropy. 
For a secure, easy to remember passphrase, use a string of words that is NOT a meaningful sentence.
"to be or not to be" =&gt; FAIL
"to pickle or not to be" =&gt; WIN

And *that* is why you don't act like an asshole to your customers. 
I wouldn't be surprised if 5 million dollars worth of PayPal orders get cancelled today as thousands of users jump ship to ASICMiner.
And *just wait* until ASICMiner starts shipping 28nm product. *So glad* I didn't pre-order a Monarch.

Just sell your shares on Bitfunder for Bitcoins, and buy them back on havelockinvestments.com
Havelock is based in Canada, so no SEC drama, they've been around much longer than Bitfunder, and their site is really well done.
Also, if you buy ASIC Miner shares (which a lot of people are doing, because the price has gone up 30% over the past 2 days), you can convert them to independent shares not tied to any exchange.
