Let us just remember some basic math. Even after next year's halving coins will keep getting generated at a speed of 12.5 every ten minutes. If the value of bitcoin reached $100,000 per coin, bitcoins would get rapidly and constantly dumped on the open market for fiat at a rate of $100,000 x 12.5 x 6 x 24 = $180,000,000 per DAY, or $65bln per year. Mankind would have to burn all that money in electricity and capital investments simply to maintain the Bitcoin network. *Anything* short of that would cause a price decrease. So no, bitcoins are not going to $100,000 anytime soon, not in ten years and certainly not next year. I am surprised that the $220 price is so stable considering that even at this comparatively low price fresh bitcoins are being dumped on the market at a rate of $300mln per year.

If vaue goes double but the hashing power stays the same then you'll have an unvarying amount of hashing power securing an increasing amount of wealth, which makes attacks on the network more interesting. Roght now the network is oversecured, in the future without a fee market it won't be. The biggest question about bitcoin future is whether the block reward can be replaced by fees and maintain the ecosystem sustainable.

Regardless of whether it's fair or reasonable (and it most definitely isn't, considering that right now btc is *not* creating $65bln of value for anyone), what matters is only if it's going to happen. And I'm pretty we are not going to see the world's billionaires and hedge funds pouring $65bln into bitcoin every year.

I don't have a problem with this – any majority chain (including the present one) should be prepared to attack minority hashpower chains.

"Cultural context" justifications like these are pure bigotry of low expectations. I have China experience as well (don't worry, China "experts" are a dime a dozen these days) and I am also familiar with the business practices of Chinese companies. Yes, they all do this. They don't do it because it's part of Chinese culture and sanctioned in Confucius's Analects, they do it because it is convenient. Never do these "cultural differences" damage the Chinese party, it's always the Westerner who gets shortchanged. Chinese business culture mimics sociopathy very closely through extensive use of deception, blackmail, honeypot traps, impersonation, fatiguing the opponent, judicial and political corruption and all the rest of the crook's toolbox (anyone interested can check out the "Thirty-Six Stratagems" to see examples of this kind of Machiavellic sociopathy in writing - it's a very basic business reading in China).

All your points are honestly irrelevant.
1) It doesn't matter whether users run their store from their home computer or on a hosting service – as long as they can *choose* where to run it, and as long as it can be done through a large variety of hosting services. Email is made no less revolutionary by the fact that most people do not run their own SMTP server – but they can, and this makes email a decentralised service unlike facebook.
2) Openbazaar will "be on google" with crawlers like Bazaarbay that will index OB stores.
3) Obenbazaar is not "reinventing websites stores + Mycelium gear", since personal websites have no third-party decentralised arbitration and they are harder to set up for the end user than Openbazaar stores.
4) Openbazaar offers the same time of censorhsip resistance the internet does. On the internet no private entity can tell you what you can or can't do and what websites you can or can't start – only the law can. If Microsoft had gotten control of the internet through their private "compuserve" offering, the *entire* internet would have terms of service similar to those of private websites. This is the censorship resistance that really matters, not the freedom to sell kalashnikovs and heroine without being traced, and this is the freedom from censorship that Openbazaar offers.

@_date: 2016-02-19 02:52:04
1) Internet freedoms are not drying up – the internet is however becoming more centralised. As long as there are a sufficient number of actors that can provide OB hosting, and as long as stores can be self-hosted, this has no effect on OB users.
2) Normal internet users won't, but bitcoiners will. If Openbazaar was open today and well-stocked I wouldn't hesitate to do a significant amount of my shopping on it.
3) For traditional credit card/paypal e-commerce the arbitration is already done by credit card companies/paypal, usually in favour of the buyer. For bitcoin online shops, there was no viable business model until now. The OB guys received a bunch of money from a venture capital firm to build the protocol and then establish their own moderation service (OB1).
4) Openbazaar was not made for bibles in Iran, it was made a) to remove marketplace monopoly power from intermediaries such as eBay which add significantly less value to transactions than they extract b) to remove the discretionary power of centralised services not to accept specific types of (legal) merchandise, so that the responsibility for what is being sold rests firmly with the vendors themselves. Openbazaar was not made to put users above the law, but to have *only* the law to respond to.

It does matter where miners are located, since a majority of hash power is located in a country where the government has arbitrary control to shut down or seize the ASICs. What we get is a bitcoin network that operates with the tacit consensus of the Communist Party of China. At the moment, it would take only a handful of knocks on the door by a couple of dozen policemen to execute an arbitrary amount of doublespends, or to create a fork on the network that would consist of more than 50% of hash power.

If there are no ways to scale that have become viable and mature once the 2mb (+ segwit) cap has been reached then the controversy will start again. The reason for the modest increase is in the hope that some of the scaling solutions which are on the table (lightning network, sidechains) will be ready before we hit 2mb. Even Gavin &amp; Jeff don't believe that bitcoin can reach Visa levels of transactions on-chain. They think that modest blocksize bumps are a lesser damage to the network than 1) changing the economics of bitcoin transactions at this stage in a way that reduces its usefulness for a large segment of its current userbase 2) betting the house on solutions which have not been developed and sufficiently tested yet (lightning networks, sidechains, segwit).

There's no pleasing some people.

For example, he claims that 'permissioned' cryptographic ledgers can be used by restricted groups of agents (e.g. organisations which don't completely trust each other or various actors within organisations) to track the movement of assets in a way that is less efficient than the classic Excel file but removes the necessity of a central trusted actor to edit said Excel file.

I feel the same way you do on this topic. Bitcoin will never 'get big' simply by having young enthusiasts pester their friends and families about how Bitcoin is the future, it needs a number of narrow use cases in which even cynics realise that they are selfishly better off using a bitcoin-enabled system rather than one that isn't. Six years after its introduction Bitcoin has yet to win *any* such tests against reality.
Recently I have become less and less convinced that remittances are one such area where this can happen if enough entreprenurial ingenuity is brought to bear on the task. The one domain where BTC really has a chance to shine is in its capacity to operate as a disintermediated clearing house for value transactions across networks which do not have an established protocol to interoperate. Right now financial transactions have to take place end-to-end on rails such as Paypal, Visa or SWIFT, and the rails belong to the railroad company. Bitcoin allows for "4WD transactions", where even the smallest outfits can have access (and not be denied) on- or and off-ramps to the system. But ultimately this is more of Ripple's value proposition than Bitcoin's.

The most likely option, in my opinion, is that Satoshi Nakamoto was a persona used by Nick Szabo and Hal Finney, and perhaps others.
Arguments supporting Szabo's involvement point to his reclusive nature, studies on his writing style – which has been found to be very similar to that of Satoshi – and by the fact that at a critical point before the publication of the Bitcoin whitepaper he wrote a bitcoin-relevant blog post which he later post-dated to make it appear as if it had been published after Bitcoin's whitepaper.
Hal Finney's involvement seems to be proven by the fact that Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto's family house was a few blocks away from his (what are the chances, really, of that being a coincidence?) – he probably adopted suggested the pseudonym believing that for was at the time a fringe project this level of subterfuge would be sufficient. Finney's writing style was also considered by some as being very close to Satoshi's own. He was also the second person to ever mine bitcoin.

He didn't mention any of the potential problems in the future of bitcoin (such as the emergenge of a better cryptocurrency), he often stated directly points which he was there to demonstrate (and which should not be passed as simple facts to an educated audience) and often used intentionally ambiguous language ("people use bitcoin to save"...no they don't...unless you consider high-risk speculation "saving").

I would argue that the ways in which the early community thought Bitcoin would take off by replacing the USD in online AND brick and mortar transactions is completely dead, or at least on life support until much later on. I see no good arguments to be made in favour of this option, and the last couple of years has seen only limited success in the ecommerce world. There are other venues through which bitcoin could gain more than a toehold in other markets, and the technology (and the companies) which are required to make that work are only now being built. There are a few arrows to shoot still a few years down the line.

The difficulty is based on the time that elapses between blocks, not on block size. The problem with increasing the block size (beyond a certain point) is that if Bitcoin becomes sustainable in the long run we're gonna need some competition for space on the blockchain. This is unlikely to take shape anytime soon with BIP101, and an 8GB maximum blocksize might be far too much, even if it is technically feasible.

Yes – localbitcoins is used to buy and sell bitcoins in places where there are no exchanges or where the infrastructure for whichever reason is not adequate. As a EU resident I don't see many advantages on using an exchange like yours over – for example – Coinbase.

Enlightened maybe, but not especially selfish. The real reasons to invest in a bitcoin startup rather than in BTC directly are (in my opinion) three: 1) if bitcoin is overtaken by another cryptocurrency a startup can probably adapt easily to the new system and relatively little is lost, but if you invest in BTC your entire investment would disappear 2) BTC could be very successful but reach maturity as a very high-velocity currency to be bought and sold rapidly for remittances and international value transfers, which would limit its growth potential 3) we don't know yet what type of opportunities BTC companies will have to expand in businesses we have yet to imagine in just a few years; having an established brand and expertise in the field will help develop those opportunities.

I am still not sure why centralised exchanges should be an insurpassable weak link in BTC (any more than they are for any other urrency or commodity which is being traded). The link you posted in the original article is very interesting, but it applies to any bubble in general, including the dotcom bubble of the 1990s, and we now know that the internet didn't die right there.

That's not the right comparison. Apple beat windows in a new market, not by making a better OS for PCs(which it had all along). As for Android, Apple never even tried to monopolise the smartphone's market, although it did succeed in reaping 93% of the industry's profits (as per this week's news).

I guess that charging lower fees "because they know they can't get away with charging more" is the very definition of competition. As the BTC payment system becomes more crowded good luck increasing your fees. Bitpay *might* become another Paypal, but if it did it would be for another entity to emerge as a better alternative. Alternatives will emerge even if Bitpay turns out to be the most efficient and customer-friendly company in the universe. The type of environment which bitcoin creates makes it impossible to lock people into fixed ecosystems such as Paypal's.


It doesn't matter what bitcoin was "supposed to be", especially since it was supposed to be different things to different kinds of people. What matters is whether there will be a viable use-case for the currency in the future which will bring about mass adoption, regardless of future intention. Low-friction transactions are one such use case.


Fair objections about which I would also like to hear more convincing solutions, but which to me seem more unsolved problems than hard boundaries which cannot possibly be solved.


You are confusing the 'agnostic' qualities of of Bitcoin's protocol with copyright issues for a technical product. Apples and oranges.


Fiat currencies cannot possibly possess BTC's most fundamental characteristic as a store of value – predictable and reliable scarcity – and cannot be instantiated as digital tokens in a way that is as fluid and cheap as cryptos. The fact that right now BTC minsers are burning through hundreds of millions of dollars a year to secure the network (which does not seem very efficient) is because so many coins are still being created, and the amount of computing power dedicated to mining necessarily tends to approximate the price of the new BTC being created. This will change in a doubling or two.


If BTC succeeds, people will exchange BTC with each other directly, without going in and out of fiat constantly.


That is not a problem brought by the exchanges, but by BTC's speculative nature as a nascent (and possibly soon to be dead) commodity.


There is not reason why BTC can't acquire some new features on the go (for example support for multisig wallets, as has happened recently). We'll see if the design-space of cryptocurrency is so vast that truly original, explosive and uncopiable features emerge which nobody has thought of yet.
I also think that we'd be better finishing our conversation here. It was a pleasure reading your replies and I appreciated the effort you put into them.

For those who would like a TL;DR:
M-Pesa has been in Kenya since 2006, but over the past 3-4 years there has been an exponential increase in its use. An American woman who was interviewed at some point said that now her economic life is about 95% cashless. People use M-Pesa by depositing and withdrawing money at various tellers, who in return credit or withdraw a certain amount of funds from their accounts (much like with Abra). Sometimes there are technical problems and the money might take the whole day to arrive or might be sent back. Fees become larger and larger as transactions get smaller (sending $1 costs about $1.6; a breakdown of M-Pesa fees can be found [here]( About half of the rural and unbanked population of Kenya uses M-Pesa at this point.
Towards the end of the video they discuss (and here is where it gets interesting) how Safaricom (the company who runs the M-Pesa system) is starting to use its monopoly power to act as a gatekeeper and "keep startups from using the system". This was not explained well and no examples were given, but it is an expected step of the process which brings players, once they have established themselves, to use their influence to extract rather than create value. For obvious reasons, this opens a door for Bitcoin. A second problem they mention is that M-Pesa cannot work for large transactions or for merchants, since it leaves no paper trail.

Just remember that this is designed to send value within the facebook network, much like paypal can only be used to send value within the Paypal network. It's great, as long as all the people you want to send money too are also your facebook friends, or you don't mind becoming a friend of all the people you need to send money to. With bitcoin there is no such thing as an exclusive network, and all you need to send money is a public key.

As I've put it in the past, Bitcoin has essentially become Paypal 2.0. Especially now we have companies like 'Bitpay'.
1) Bitpay charges fees that are lower than its direct competitors, especially if you take into account purchases between parties which use different 'home' currencies. And with more competitors entering the market fees can only go down (unlike for example with the credit card market, which is inaccessible to all but a few very large players capable of deploying infrastructure – POS systems for example – and maintaining an army of employees).
2) Exchanges are only used to enter/exit the BTC economy, not to be the centre of the BTC economy. BTC might very well fail (I personally give it less than 50% chance of becoming established), but if it succeeded exchanges would become a marginal part of the ecosystem, as a growing portion of BTC transactions never become fiat.
And yes, it is perfectly possible that BTC won't be the cryptocurrency of the future, and that a different one (Ethereum?) will replace it, but at this stage we have to wonder whether any altcoin's marginal advantage will ever trump BTC's established network effect and inertia. I honestly can't imagine the combination of characteristics which an altcoin would need to have to beat BTC's advantage, but I accept that my imagination is maybe just too limited.

I can't imagine a better comparison. "Saving" requires a reasonable expectation of value preservation over the long run, with only a minor emphasis on increasing the capital. Investing in bitcoin (or going to the casino) on the other hand is a high stake, high reward game where you know that you're very unlikely to come out of the door with the same amount of money you had when you walked in – in either direction. The only difference is that at the roulette table the house has by definition better odds than you.

This is the part I don't get. The blockchain allows for cooperation among a very large number of untrusted partners since everyone and anyone can choose participate and increase the safety of the network, and defection is not rewarded. This is necessary if you have a decentralised network composed of many, unknown entities. But if you want to create a ledger system for central banks (presumably not many more than a dozen) you can very well just do it without going through the trouble of creating a blockchain system.
Which leads me to the question...what is the point?

I bet that the system will involve users being able to buy download bandwidth with bitcoin (rather than monthly subscription), while those who share will get a cut. It might include payment channels a la 21 Inc, and will try to leverage more granular payments for the download of pirated content.
