So how do they make money then?

I see this; "Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks"  What does that mean?
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:17:38
What is powder, in this context?
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:37:10
Haha it was a question :)
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:21:34
Is government control the primary definer of fiat currency?  I thought it was just something that "represents" value - regardless of who is in control(?)
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:57:47
Ahh, cheers!
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:27:34
Fiat currency is money, something that represents value but doesn't have any inherent value. (As opposed to an apple which you can eat, for example.)

So the US stock market was a bubble?
And the Chinese stock market?
Japanese stocks?
Oil? ....
Sure they went up and then crashed for those periods, but on the whole timeline they've trended upwards.
Of course "bubbles" exist, just don't invest more than you are willing to lose, whilst remembering that you only "lose" when (and *if*) you **sell**.
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:57:43
Good to know.
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:19:45
Isn't bitcoin just as "paper" in concept, as paper money? As in it has no intrinsic value?

I love how cheap, sick and sleazy his stockbroker seems.

He'll place 2 rubber balls in front of him, and pick the one on the left, then cut it up, put it in a smoothie and drink it.
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:27:00
Ahh, thanks! I did not know that, cool.
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:42:28
How could a society prevent inflation?  (Serious question)
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:57:38
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:29:06
Wow, this is amazing to watch!
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:34:09
I don't follow?
@_date: 2017-11-10 05:48:25
I guess the US stock markets full lifespan, as opposed to just short time frames like in the bubble graph.
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:33:25
As a bit of a newb - is the implication/hope that Bitcoin will one day replace Fiat?
@_date: 2017-10-21 00:05:37
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:03:29
Can someone please set me straight on something?  Every day I hear that:
a) My bitcoins *are on* my hardware wallet/ledger/Trezor
and then
b) Hardware wallets are more of a key, and don't contain any actual "coins"
So which is it?
@_date: 2018-02-18 23:12:18
Fuck, I hope so.
@_date: 2017-10-21 00:05:50
Nice, cheers!
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:42:05
So Gary just made about $250,000? Nice
@_date: 2017-10-23 03:01:38
I thought the Trezor was just a key, not an actual storage device?
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:21:42
Thanks mate, that website ( Doesn't have any axis labels, what exactly am I looking at?
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:25:21
Another question: Is there any danger of governments cracking down on cryptocurrency and making it illegal so the banks get more business?
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:33:15
Righto, thanks.
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:22:36
I like the poker analogy!
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:14:25
Out of curiosity - that person who now owes several million dollars, what if they can't pay up?
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:10:08
Also:  Do we know who programmed Bitcoin?  Who created the software platform?  Are they legit?  Can people see the source code?  How do we know the code doesn't contain some worm that is going to steal our BC?
