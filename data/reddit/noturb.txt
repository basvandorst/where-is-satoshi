My hot tip was correct. GDAX down and btc will be sub 1k with in hours. Hate to say I told you so.
@_date: 2018-03-28 12:43:44
Hot tip from the top: market is about to severely crash to sub 1k and never recover. Sell now and save yourselves. Over and out

Laugh. That's what I'm doing

Your response holds zero value young padawan. Keep trading your weekly allowance while I dominate the market.

You're just telling yourself what you want to hear

I didn't realize children used this sub. I hope you make some profit with your weekly allowance kid.

This morning it stopped at exactly 15k (AUD) and now it's stopped at exactly 14k. Why does it do this? It struggles to break into the next thousand it seems.

Mmm I can taste the sweet tears of those panic sellers during the crash, where are y'all? Shout out to those with big balls who invested during the crash.
Mmm the sweet, sweet tears.

Lol peasant.

Bet there's a lot of regret slowly sinking in for those who got scared and wanted out over the last few days. The climb has begun. The investers with balls will be rewarded
