I dont think this is what Circle is offering, but what would be insanely cool would be a hybrid bank. You store your money in it, in dollars. It also has a built in bitcoin wallet. You can transfer dollars into the bitcoin wallet at the current price, plus a 0.5% fee. You can also directly send dollars, which would be deducted from your account (plus the 0.5% fee) to a bitcoin address. You are also given a couple of wallet addresses. One address allows you to receive bitcoin directly to your bitcoin wallet, and they remain in bitcoin. Another receives the bitcoin, automatically converts it to dollars, and deposits them in your account. All for a 0.5% fee. 
This account would be online only, and backed by another bank, much like Simple Checking is. Fee wise, it would be similar to Simple, very minimal fees. This would be **THE** killer app for bitcoin. The average every day person could use it. If you wanted to settle up a bill with another user, you could send them dollars via bitcoin, and they could receive it and have it converted to dollars. If you were settling up with someone who didnt use the service, you could send dollars via bitcoin, and they would receive it just like bitcoin. Since they hold your dollars, there wouldnt need to be any need for wait periods, everything could be instant. Since you could have a direct deposit into this account, it make it very simple for anyone to have or use bitcoin, and go back and forth. 
Someone please make this service!

This is really what disappointed me when the old tip bot shut down. It was easy. A user didn't have to sign up for anything, a wallet was just created. From there, they could forward it on to their own wallet or pay it forward.

You can send BTC to an address that does not have a known private key. If that private key is ever found, those coins would still be there. An address doesnt have to "accept" the coins, if it is a valid address, that is how it will be recorded in the blockchain.

What will end up happening is they will keep a tiny portion of your balance in bitcoin. This will allow it to fluctuate slightly, but not much. They will then store the remaining amount in fiat and just buy bitcoin when you want to send it. That allows you to see a dollar balance that changes (up and down) only a small amount. It also removes most of the risk, and they could still profit some of the bitcoin profits (and stomach some of the loss) if they so chose. 
@_date: 2014-04-12 09:12:19
Thats not how deflation works? If bitcoin was currently deflationary, the total amount of bitcoin lost (private keys destroyed, sent to a burn address, etc) would have to outstrip the newly minted coins. That clearly is not happening, and will not happen for many years to come. Bitcoin is currently inflationary, but it is a fixed monetary supply, so we know exactly at what rate it will inflate if all other conditions are the same.

If you are in the US and are operating without being registered as a Money Transmitter with FinCEN, then yes, it is illegal. It doesnt matter the amount. There are no transaction sized exemptions. Additionally, you may need to register with state/local agencies, but that varies wildly. 
From personal experience, the hassle of being legal didnt justify the amount of profit that could be brought in, and the risks of being illegal didnt justify the amount of profit that could be brought in. 
If you are going to go the legal route, I would recommend an ATM, as they can automate your compliance program. You still need the licenses, but there are less man hours involved. Even with an ATM, I found it wasnt worth the investment for my area, but every city is different.

Some of these things exist in the bitcoin protocol, there just isnt good implementation. Im more inclined to say that these things need to be provided by payment services type companies, like Coinbase and Bitpay, and not by bank/deposit businesses. 
It needs to be automated, no problems? The transaction proceeds, using the escrow in the bitcoin protocol. Problem? You open a ticket, and submit documentation. The transaction should happen on the blockchain. In other instances, Coinbase and Bitpay (and similar) should allow businesses to display trust ratings that show how many problem free transactions they have done, and what percentage of their total transactions were problem free. 
@_date: 2014-07-16 19:34:04
The problem with that is you can not sign a transaction with your private key and do a "pull" transaction, like bitcoin is designed for. Your private key could be shared with the "pull" wallet, but then you no longer have control of your private key. 
A third option could maybe be you have a 2 of 3 multisig where the "pull" wallet has one key, you have another, and a third party has the third. The "pull" wallet is required to verify with either you, or the third party that the agreement is still valid, then it can "pull" the wallet. This wouldnt have to require your intervention, because the third party could act on your behalf. At the same time, you could verify with the third party to move funds or cancel the agreement. Obviously this requires two of the three parties to agree, so it is still possible for funds to be misallocated, but it is less likely than if you just handed your keys over. 
Here is an example of how this could work in a Paypal like situation for a recurring subscription. Company A is the neutral third party. Subscriber is the "pull" wallet. You are you. 
You subscribe to a service. After presenting the terms, they bounce you over to Company A. Company A displays the terms you agreed to, allows you to make tweaks to the agreement, and has you consent to the service. You agree. Company A gives you a private key, sends a private key to Subscriber, and keeps a key for itself. In one month when your payment is due, Subscriber creates the transaction. They send it over to Company A, who reviews the amount, date of last payment, etc to verify it is all within terms. They sign the transaction and submit it to the network. If something isnt within terms, Company A bounces it back to Subscriber, who then sends the transact to you. You review it, if you agree, then you sign it and submit it to the network. If you dont agree, you dont sign it and Subscriber doesnt receive the funds. If you agree, Subscriber bounces you back to Company A to update the terms, that way the payment will work correctly. If Company A does not see the transaction ever finalized, it requests you update the terms or delete the agreement so that funds wont mistakenly be sent in the future. 
A few months later you decide you arent happy with the service that Subscriber is providing, so you decide to cancel it. Their customer service is on level with Comcast's, so they wont let you. You simply go to Company A and blacklist them. They are no longer able to request funds from you. 
In an alternate universe though, Company A went bankrupt! You can then contact subscriber and say "We need to use a different 3rd party". They agree, so you both sign transactions to move your funds over to Company B. Company B serves the same role as Company A, and they simply need to update the terms and issue new keys.

There is so much misunderstanding in this thread. Exchanges are not banks, and bitcoin isn't fiat. They aren't governed by the same standards, and exchanges don't have the funds to pay off governments. When banks fuck up, they pay fines. When exchanges fuck up, people get arrested. You can't fault them for being overcautious. They are trying to cover their asses. While they want to make money, they don't want to go to jail doing so. Encouraging the use of exchanges that don't confirm to regulations will lead to heartbreak. Exchanges will get shut down, funds will be seized, and government responses to release your thousands of dollars will be a big fuck you. You think being treated like a criminal by Bitstamp is bad? Imagine being treated like a criminal by a European or American law enforcement agency. Imagine having to hire a lawyer to retrieve your funds with no promises of success. 
Bitstamp is not without fault. They should **immediately** stop accepting funds from unverified accounts. They should **immediately** require one final act of KYC on any accounts they have already marked as risky. They should **Immediately** allow any customer who can log into their account to withdraw without prejudice. They should **immediately** provide a means for those who are unable to produce the required documents to retrieve funds in some manner, or have an obvious "appeal" process for those who are unable to retrieve funds. They should **immediately** reduce some of the requirements in KYC that are overblown. No one should be expected to have a receipt for graphics cards they purchased four years ago, nor should they be expected to sign a message from a wallet that could have been hosted by a service that no longer exists. 
These are common sense reforms. These are obvious choke points, and they have not adequately explained why they feel they must perform a background check and an anal probing, when they should only need to perform the background check. 
Until these are resolved, use a friendlier compliant exchange, but don't encourage the use of exchanges that are a liability to the community.

I agree. isnt among the worse of them. If we are going to remove trolls (and not skeptics), then I think it is important we make a strong distinction. People who resort to personal attacks, or generalized attacks against the community using profane or inappropriate speech/actions, those are the people who should be removed. Its also very important to not be overly aggressive, because our critics wont stop. They will come back with new accounts, and do it all over again, but with vengeance. 
Honestly, we should just let them be. Down vote them and report profane posts and personal attacks. The mods are reasonably good about keeping the place tidy. I would like to see a formal statement regarding these behaviors though, and perhaps a greater effort to remove some of these posts more quickly.

I hope so, but it is a little arrogant to assume the inevitability of bitcoin. While a powerful technology, it is a new technology. I believe in the inevitability of the evolution of money, but it is more likely not bitcoin. Dont get me wrong, Im heavily invested in bitcoin and in the community, so I want it to succeed, but I just think it is a little off putting to outsiders when we highlight stuff like this and pretend that we are already there. We arent, and we wont be for some time. Bitcoin will be around in 30 years, but it may not mean anything. It impossible to claim something is a guard against deflation when you cant say with certainty if it will exist in a meaningful way in 30 years.

@_date: 2014-04-14 18:49:17
It’s costly. It’s not that they arent capable, it is simply too expensive. 
Amazon divides programmers into groups. So you are going to have to have a group that takes care of their backend software working on it, a group that maintains the shopping cart function working on it, a group that maintains their accounting software working on it, and a group that maintains their customer service software working on it. 
They are going to have to administrators write procedures and policies for internal management, they are going to have to train select customer service reps and managers on it, same with accounting, same with legal. 
Finally there is the bigger issue. Amazon doesnt really utilize third party services, they tend to keep things in house. They arent simply going to partner with Coinbase or Bitpay, they are going to build their own solution to hedge against exchange rates. This will require even more maintenance and programing time. They will then also need to dedicate a network security team to secure and maintain the security of this portion. 
All of this will cost millions of dollars up front, and on going costs of several hundreds of thousands of dollars per year, if not into the millions. Its very difficult to suggest that they would receive enough business via bitcoin to warrant the investment. 
Now before you start bitching about how they could use Coinbase or Bitpay, they could also use Paypal or Stripe. They could integrate with Google Wallet. They dont. They keep payment processing in house, because it offers the most affordable rates, and it gives them the ultimate control. They are large enough that it is worth the cost of maintaining it in house. They would not use a third party processor for bitcoin. 
Face it, bitcoin would benefit from Amazon accepting it far more than Amazon would benefit from accepting bitcoin. They dont need free advertising. They dont need a gimmick to drum up business or to make them relevant again (looking at you Overstock, I love you!). They would be doing bitcoin a HUGE favor, not the other way around.

But we are talking about people in the developing world. If you have to rely on remittances from family abroad to make ends meet, you have no business in currency speculation. If you are relying on that money for day to day life, it is not money you can afford to lose. Again, it is up to Western users to grow and stabilize bitcoin before we can expect users in developing nations to rely on it. 
Imagine how devastating the bleed from $680 to $300 would have been for someone who was relying on that money. Maybe every month they would receive a little more cash, and by the next month what they were living off of was worth 15% less (or more). Yes, it works in the opposite direction to sometimes, but that doesn't matter so much when you truly need it. If you have day to day needs, you aren't going to have the luxury of waiting out a severe down movement (think bearwhale). You probably aren't going to have the resources or the savvy to hedge or trade those movements either, and even if you did, it wouldn't matter if you need to eat. 
We can circlejerk about the ideal scenario, but as long as we fail to see the reality we are currently operating in, as long as we chose to ignore the reality of the people we are trying to impose our little utopia on, we will fail to solve all of these problems. Bitcoin is barely usable as a currency for those who have a little. It is abhorrent to see people sit around and question why those who have nothing, those who are living in developing nations and struggling to do so, are not participating in our little experiment. Bitcoin, outside of background service, is not ready for the developing world.

Probably nothing yet, since this is the first mention. I have a feeling we will start to see more of this though, and not *necessarily* in a bad way, but I think all major businesses in the financial world are going to want a clear and concise legal and regulatory framework regarding bitcoin, that way they know how to draft their internal policies. Remember, a lobbyist's job is not only to influence lawmaking, but to gather advance information from lawmakers. In Mastercard's case, it would be helpful for them to know whether there could be regulation regarding the operation or sales of large quantities of mining equipment, as mining could at some point be looked at a way to launder money (buy mining equipment with dirty money, mine at a loss, clean bitcoins).

I would just counter that you no longer have access to the funds, therefore you have not made a deposit. I would then call the credit card company, and fill them in on the situation and ask if you are able to dispute them. It might be more hassle than its worth, but really, I doubt they will take any action against you over $100. Given all of the problems that they have had with legality in the past, and it is my understanding that it is still not legal for them to operate with US players, I really dont think there is a law enforcement agency for them to bitch to. 
Now, it may be against your TOS for your credit card to use it on a gambling website, especially if it is a rewards or cash back card. Definitely keep that in mind as well.

Did you talk to a rep from their "loss control" department, or whatever they are calling the department that is issuing these closures? When I did, they informed me that ALL of my accounts, including loans would be closed. They asked specifically about mortgages, but I dont have mine with them. They requested payment within 30 days on a loan I still had a couple months on, though they did let me keep making payments on my credit card (but pulled the promo interest, and of course the card couldnt be used any more). 
They dont want your money anymore, if you have a mortgage and are in a position to move it, do so whether they make you or not. Mortgages are more regulated, so they may not be able to force you to move it.

So in summary, they have never explicitly said "everything", but that have also implied that everything was instant. Further, they have said they want to make it more frictionless and different from their competitors (Coinbase), yet they have basically the same limits. 
I have no problem with this 99% of the time. That 1% is going to be when I want to settle up with someone for a large sum, say I want to send my parents, $1000 for their anniversary vacation trip. Only half of that transaction would be handled instantly, and the limit would throw me off for the rest of the week when I'm trying to buy groceries with Gyft or ordering myself something on Overstock.

Lets assume they are building a new coin or new blockchain implmentation, because that is what we are talking about. Why would they leave participation wide open? Wouldnt it be a closed source, closed access system, completely devoid of outside participation?

Just like you need to have a SWIFT/IBAN number to participate in the current systems, wouldnt it be like that?

Sort of. All of these operators had to develop AML and KYC policies. Robocoin's is very conservative, erroring on the side of caution and not jail/harsh fines. Additionally, they allow the operator (Robocoin doesn't necessarily operate the machine) disable the more invasive features, if they chose. 
On the flip side, if the other machine is just letting you buy with no verification, they are probably not following the rules and are literally risking their freedom to sell you bitcoin. 
Both of them are insane. You can meet regulatory compliance without performing an anal probe, and you absolutely should. It isn't worth the risk of going to jail just to be slightly more convenient.

Willing does not mean able. I would give them the benefit of the doubt, if they had the funds they would pay out of their own pocket. I suspect, and this is pure baseless speculation, that the amount is so great that they either don't have enough money or they aren't willing to spend that amount of money. If this is the case, it would actually make sense for them to cause turmoil in their exchange. If they can get people to sell coins for 1/2 their value on other exchanges, they have created an extremely effective arbitrage opportunity, which could allow them enough profit to make their customers whole, which would keep lawsuits and potential jail time at bay. 
They could lose every single customer through acts of market manipulation and apparent incompetence, but at the end of the day/week/month, their customers would be at 100% funded and they could walk safe from legal liabilities.

While I agree that people should be moving away from large mining pools, I strongly disagree that Ghash.io will have any negative, permanent effect on price. 
The whole concept of mining is to incentivize people to play by the rules. Even if Ghash.io grew to 51%, that doesnt mean they would harm the network. In fact, doing so would negatively effect their holdings as well, and make their hash power, and their 25 BTC mining reward worthless!

Again, because your buy and HODL actions are much smaller than traders actions. This is like complaining about how you didnt influence the USD/YEN markets when you bought currency to take with you on your trip to Tokyo. 
In any market the retail user has the least amount of impact. Traders, brokers, institutional investors, etc will always carry the bulk of the activity (and direction) because they have significantly more funds. 
Bitcoin, even with its mere $4B market cap isnt going to be swayed by retail level holders. It doesnt matter where they are buying their coins (I mean, you could buy off of Bitstamp, but its still not going to matter).

With big customers, like Walmart, you would already have billing agreements in place. Walmart isn't going to be able to initiate that BTC payment any more quickly than they could a wire transfer, and to most, if not every business, clearing a BTC payment is 30 minutes vs a wire transfer in 24 hours isn't going to matter. Furthermore, if you are relying on a payment processor or exchange to cash out your BTC, that would probably end up being slower than just taking the wire transfer. 
While the company I work for has never dealt with Walmart, we do have every major pharmaceutical company as customers. We receive cleared, processed payments from them within 48 business hours of emailing the invoice. I'm a proponent of bitcoin, but if we needed to cash out even $1 of that transaction, we would not save any time in processing and receiving their payments.

Hiding is probably the wrong word. I'm on mobile, so I can't readily link it, but on the other Circle post, I spelled out the framework of a hybrid bank/BTC institution. They could function as an online checking account, but also have BTC features. You would have your bank account, viewed in dollars, and your wallet viewed in BTC. At any point you could send USD to a BTC address, and it would convert your dollars to BTC instantly, charge a nominal fee, and send the transaction. You could also send it from your BTC wallet for free. You could go between fiat and BTC for  a nominal fee within your account. You could have a BTC address where you receive payments and they are kept in BTC, and you could have an address where you receive payment and they are converted to dollars and placed in your checking account. 
I don't think this is what Circle is doing. I don't think Circle is going to be an outright bank. I do think Circle will offer dollar pegged accounts, likely by keeping most of your funds in dollars and simply purchasing BTC with those dollars as you withdraw.

In short, you really dont. Unless you control your private keys (with Coinbase and Circle, you do not) you have absolutely no way to know if they are being honest. A short, simple answer is to use a wallet like Blockchain.info, Electrum, MyCelium, Armory, Greenaddress, Bitcoin-QT, or others, where you and only you control your bitcoin. Of course, you and only you will be responsible for the security of your bitcoin. 
Now for why Mt Gox and Coinbase may or may not be comparable. Mt Gox was run by a very inexperienced owner/CEO. Most would say incompetent. Coinbase on the other hand has millions of dollars in venture capital funding (along with the guidance that VC funding typically brings) and has much better leadership. Mt Gox had some warning signs early on too that Coinbase has not experienced, such as delays in letting people withdraw money, difficulties with their partner banks, regulatory probes, confiscated US bank accounts, and an on going lawsuit with a former US partner firm. 
You have to be very careful who you will trust you BTC with, but Coinbase is definitely a better bet than Mt Gox was.

That is the entire point of bitcoin though, they dont have control of it. They cant simply snatch the funds up. Blockchain is a normal wallet, it just happens to back your wallet file on their servers. This is like uploading an encrypted copy of your Bitcoin-QT wallet.dat file. Yes, they could attempt to snatch your keys with malware or otherwise snoop to gain access, but they could do that for *every* wallet. Your keys are only ever decrypted on your client PC, never on Blockchain's server. So, just like running Bitcoin-QT, the only way they can steal your keys is by gaining access to your computer.

Bitcoin is designed to be completely agnostic towards the source or destination of payments. While that sounds like a frightening thing, we have to remember a few things, and then also consider the pros/cons. First off, traditional currency can still be physically moved. This can be done in secret. It can be done untraceable. Second thing we need to remember is that bitcoin is not anonymous, it is infact a giant public ledger. 
To extrapolate a little bit on that, lets say that a terrorist organization is publicly soliciting donations. Because bitcoin is transparent, this terrorist organization's enemies can now watch the organizations's cash flow. They can see the addresses sending funds, and they can work backwards to try to uncover the financial backers. This could actually be more useful than the existing system, where cash is often smuggled in and out of terrorist organizations, or they take up counterfeiting to finance operations. If they were using bitcoin, the FBI could see that little Jane Jihad, operating out in plain sight in rural Texas, is donating funds.
Terrorism is bad, but it is also a state defined term. The Occupy movement could have easily been demonized as "terrorists". Political dissidents can be deemed as terrorists. Even without using that label, look at what has happened to Wikileaks and other similar organizes. In a walled in payment system, those in power can arbitrarily cut funding to those they dont agree with. So while you may want to avoid allowing terrorist funding, think about those in more repressed countries. Bitcoin can also be used to finance them. Bitcoin can be used to fund refuges who are trying to escape grave persecution in their home country. 
So my answer for you is not a simple "No, you cant stop terrorist funding", it as a question back to you, "Why would you want to?"

I doubt very many expats will be running to Bitcoin over this. Some may see Bitcoin's benefits because of this, but I dont think this will have a noticeable impact. Most will either comply or renounce their citizenship and continue to use their [now] local banks. There may be a few that then decide to use bitcoin to transfer money to their family in the states, but I cant imagine a situation where that is significant enough to look any different than the typical adaption rate.

There are no set criteria. Regardless of the amount, you are supposed to be registered with FinCEN. If it's over $10k, a CTR has to be filed, but that is routine. Suspicious activity reports get filed anytime a companies internal AML policies get violated, or when someone is just plain suspicious. Amounts only come into play with the CTR, and again, those are fairly routine.

You are right, I shouldn't have made that assumption. 
Asset forfeiture is bullshit here. A public notice is sufficient, they don't need to attempt to contact the owner. If public notice is given, usually in the form of publishing in a newspaper and posting on the Marshal's website, then that is sufficient. There is general a court hearing where claimants can attempt to stop liquidation, at which point a judge can halt or delay the liquidation until full court proceedings have resolved the dispute. 
Let me sum it up like this, it is far easier for them to take the property than it is to get it back. It is often used as a tool for retaliation, or just to line law enforcement coffers. There is a lot wrong with our justice system, but this is one of the most wrong aspects.

It is used in place of other searchable ID methods, such as fingerprints to make sure you are the same person who created the account with the ID the first time. If they didn't do that, they would need to process your ID every time.

Your accountant may suggest having it converted, but you should make that decision yourself.

Bitpay will show you the price you accepted those bitcoins at, so you have something to show on your records later, if the price goes up or down. That should be all he needs. That way you get some exposure to BTC, but if the price tanks, you still made back your cost.

Granted I never purchased from BFL, so maybe I don't understand the process. If they were using a third party processor to convert it to dollars, they were still accepting Bitcoin, the conversion happened on their end. All of the Bitcoin payment processors allow you to covert part or all to fiat, the purchaser has no knowledge or control of what happens from there. It is entirely possible, though not likely, that BFL wasn't converting at the time of purchase.

Even in the court of popular opinion it isn't fair to assume he is guilty of a massive heist. We know a lot of things were wrong at Gox. We know that they did a lot of things in a weird, not reliable fashion. There are TONS of potential for failure. 
If this happened out of the blue, it might be a little more fair to assume he stole them. Given the problems, the assertion that they are "lost" is much more reasonable than thinking he stole hundreds of millions worth of bitcoin and expected to walk away from it like nothing happened.

ATMs aren't that expensive. I can setup ATMs for $5k each, let them get packed full of cash, and run. The network couldn't possibly have an enforcement network, so at that point your order is done. It could exist on your network, but there is no cash backing it. Gone. 
What you are describing is more of a OTC exchange, but if you want it to be trustless, it must be done at the time the order is executed, No exception. The system you described essentially creates a network where the barrier to entry is much lower for the operator and therefore it is much easier for every scammer to participate and run once they have built a marginal  amount of trust. At least with centralized exchanges they have a substantial stake invested, including infrastructure investments, that make them much easier to identify (more accountability) and provides an environment where the good guys thrive and will make more money continuing to act in good faith than simply running off.

Bitcoin days destroyed. Thankfully its not as complex as it sounds. For every 1 bitcoin that sits idle for 1 day, that is 1 bitcoin day. Every time a bitcoin that has sat idle is moved, all of its "days" have been "destroyed". So if 1 BTC sits idle for 20 days, then moves, that is 20 bitcoin days destroyed. If 20 BTC sits idle for 1 day, then that is also 20 bitcoin days destroyed. 
The correction is typically down, because the assumption is that those bitcoins were idle, or out of the market, and now that they are moving, they could be reentering the market, either to be sold or even spent. Often when we see spikes of days destroyed, we are talking hundreds of thousands of days destroyed, and we often see a small dip either directly reacting to the days destroyed, or a few days later if those coins are liquidated onto an exchange. 
Days destroyed is a neutral metric, it is neither good nor bad for bitcoin. It is simply a way to measure the age of coins currently moving.

I'm fairly confident that the same people who don't know the difference between commercial banks and the retail banks they bank at are going to get extremely distraught when they have to do KYC at Bitstamp or Kraken. Perhaps I'm wrong, but I think this is overblown by *Americans* who hear the words, but don't understand the implications. If the story was "Fed announces it will charge banks negative interest rates" I don't think we would have as much confusion, as people understand that consumers do not directly bank with the Fed, and banks will not be fleeing to bitcoin. 
Edit: My response stands, but I wanted to clarify that I don't disagree with you, in that most people can't properly analyze this news, which is why in our bitcoin vacuum people think this is a big deal. In the real world, people react to things that impact them. They won't see the impact of this, so they won't react. If they are the type to hear about this and think "I need to find shelter elsewhere" then they are also likely the type to properly understand what it truly means and know that it doesn't apply. A very miniscule amount of people might reach the incorrect conclusion that it impacts them, then use that as justification to buy bitcoin, but those are the same people who are already on the brink of buying regardless. We need the people who would otherwise not consider it, or we need news outlets saying "Bitcoin will provide you shelter from this awful thing".

I see the differences more in mindset than function. Reddit, by default, encourages the use of voting and burying comments. That actually discourages diversity, as you can stay really focused on niche subjects, and count on the voting to drive contrary positions or alternate ways of thinking down, and therefore out of the community. Consider how this sub can get extremely manic, and become a constant barrage of "To the moon!" and the voices of reason are completely lost. 
In a more traditional forum, this doesn't happen. One comment is not considered more valuable than another, and all comments are give  equal weight. An active thread remains refreshed and bumped to the top, so an intelligent (or not so) conversation can be maintained between parties with different views. 
As you pointed out, you can organize Reddit this way, however not everyone does, and because the defaults aren't set that way, the culture behind Reddit is more of a hit and run approach.

Hindsight is 20/20, but you should have definitely bought the coins on his behalf (at the current price) and said when he gets back or has a way to pay you, you would transfer the coins over to him. That way he could be "in the game", but you wouldnt have to give him a $5500 loan. 
Hindsight though. Nothing you can do about it now. You could probably file a police report, but its doubtful anything will be done.

Certain transactions don't need fees, for instance if it is a large amount, or coins that haven't moved in quite some time. 
The fees exist not to compensate miners at this point, but rather to serve as antispam. If transactions didnt need fees, someone could blast millions of transactions containing a single satoshi and overwhelm the network.

Its not a reliable way to link an identity, because you dont know if the person who has them now is the person who originally stole them/sold drugs for them/did other illegal things.

No, I honestly have never watched UFC, and I dont know what role advertising or sponsorship plays in the sport. With Dogecar, it was pretty fucking obvious, since there was a giant dog plastered to the side of a car driving around the course. 
No one has specifically told me how sponsoring a player would work. I dont doubt that it is well watched and would be well received, I just dont understand how it would be executed. How would people know we are sponsoring? This, as someone who has never watched the sport, is important for me to understand.

Sort of, I think. 
I definitely don't think there were these losses due to a hack or exploit, it just doesn't make sense. I think if there were mass losses, they probably happened much earlier on. I also suspect that the US funds that were frozen play a huge roll in all of this, and I think there is some reason in the thought that there could be cold storage in US safe deposit boxes that they no longer have access to. 
Why aren't the police involved? Well, Gox was a sinking ship. I think some shady things went down while they were trying to keep their heads afloat, things that could potentially have criminal or civil penalties (misuse of customer funds, insider trading, stuff like that). I think that since the losses occurred so long ago, they don't feel there is much to gain by willingly bringing in law enforcement, but they could have a lot to lose by doing so.

Similar. Typically ETFs have arbitrage mechanisms, so that shares can be traded for the underlying asset, and the underlying asset can be traded for shares. IIRC there was indeed an arbitrage mechanism in their SEC proposal. As for pricing, look at their WinkDex index. It will probably follow that.

If I recall, Coinbase was (is?) allowing people to skip the code generated 2FA using a text to authenticate. The attacker would authenticate using the compromised Google Voice number, then remove the 2FA or even replace it with their own 2FA device. They could then spend the accounts BTC at will. The hole was with Coinbase (and stupid users), not Authy. Does that make sense? 
The moral of the story is to not store BTC on Coinbase if at all possible.

Why are we thinking of this in the same way we think of bitcoin? Maybe the bank system requires new nodes to be recognized by X other known nodes. Maybe the bank system requires new nodes to submit a verifying transaction to the network, which you could only do if you have coins, which you can only obtain from an existing member, since they are all premined. Prior to submission and confirmation of this transaction, other nodes will not send data. I'm sure there are a lot more options for "authenticating" a node. 
My point is, a bank or payment processor implemented solution isn't going to open to the public, and they aren't going to use the same core functions without first building out security and limited participation.

I actually recall something being posted a while back where Reddit published some figures on Gold purchases after bitcoin was added. Bitcoin accounted for a respectable amount of purchases (~10%) but actually had a higher amount of income based on dollars (~2-3% more than the amount of months purchased). So it clearly had value. 
I think it is ultimately the same decision that all businesses have to make, is it really going to generate enough revenue to justify development and integration costs? Reddit isnt exactly a mega-corp with tons of cash and time to spare. They are a lean organization with higher priorities. Given the right mix of time, interest, overall adaption, they will likely add it because it will make sense financially, not because a sub with 122k members begs them. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 21:23:31
I'm not trying to justify them, but with the rules are written in a manor that someone else's validation doesn't matter if a "crime" ultimately takes place. They will still be held responsible.

It made ripples for Overstock because they werent already the big player. Amazon doesnt really need to fight over a few hundred thousand customers who are still probably purchasing from Amazon, even without bitcoin! Overstock also had the benefit of the up front costs not being outrageous. It was viable for Overstock to see a return within the first year or so on their investment. For Amazon, it would take much, much longer, and they dont really feel the need to fight for a few customers, as they are already one of the largest, if not the largest, eCommerce site. They would be doing bitcoin a huge favor and receiving what amounts to nothing in return. 
It is only smart to make moves like that if you have something to gain later on. They do not. They could be one of the last major companies to adapt bitcoin without seeing their market share shrink immensely. At the end of the day, they hold the upper hand. They will adapt bitcoin if/when it is profitable for them, not in anticipation of it someday being profitable for them.

Personally I find the Dogecoin "movement" to be incredibly annoying, and to an extent, mocking. If someone wants to be involved in alts, that is there choice. They dont need to drag it into though. 
As far as taking alt donations, why? Chances are they will have to be converted to bitcoin before they can be converted to fiat (I think it is safe to assume that Andreas will be converting via Bitstamp or Kracken). That also results in multiple wallets needing to be maintained, and it makes it difficult to value the donations, because you could end up with thousands of Doge, which are worth a few dollars. 
If you want to donate, donate bitcoin and dont try to push your shitty alt while everyone else is trying to do something serious.

Nope. Addresses arent like accounts where they must be created. They always exist. That is why addresses like 1bitcoineateraddressdontsendf59kue can be valid, but the likelihood of anyone ever finding the private key to that address is very poor, so it considered a "burn" address, which essentially allows you to destroy bitcoins by sending them to an irrecoverable address.

If I didn't think they would renig on the deal, I would keep a sizeable amount in there and transfer it all out on the next downturn. 
The problem is, no one can trade perfectly. They have to at least break even, and it is a considerable amount of risk on their part. have my doubts that Neo, a company with millions of dollars worth of BTC can pull it off. I seriously doubt the author of this app can. 
@_date: 2014-01-23 23:42:13
Long term, maybe. The risks associated with bitcoin for a large merchant aren't just stability. Obviously if Amazon wanted to do Bitcoin they could partner with Coinbase/Bitpay or they could develop an in-house solution. 
The real risk is in the infrastructure it takes to accept Bitcoin in a large company. They have to integrate it into checkout, they need to educate customer service reps, they need to have lawyers look over all of the planned policies, they need to amend the user agreement, they have to educate their accountants and integrate it into their accounting platform. These are just the things I can think of off the top of my head. 
It's much easier for a small company to accept Bitcoin. In a small environment, you have to train significantly less people, you upgrade your platform less frequently, and you can readily partner with third parties without anyone caring. The benefits quickly out way the liabilities. It would probably cost Amazon a couple million dollars to integrate and train everyone, and it would then cost tens of thousands of dollars to upkeep and maintain. Obviously they don't think that there is a return on investment, and honestly, there probably isn't right now.

@_date: 2014-05-20 12:39:15
But the second you send from one of those addresses to an outside address, it is traceable. Lets look at it in this oversimplified way:
You mine 25 BTC
You move 5 BTC to your hot wallet, 20 BTC to cold storage
You decide to buy some alpaca socks for 1 BTC
You move 1 BTC to a fresh address
You send 1 BTC to the merchent
The merchant could now work backwards. 
Merchant looks at the 1 BTC they receive and find it comes from another address that had 5 BTC
Merchant looks at the 5 BTC address and sees it was sent from an address that had 25 BTC
Merchant looks at the 25 BTC address and sees the transfer of 20 BTC
Granted, few people are going to care how you move your money. However, if this was an auditor instead of a merchant, they are going to want to know the origins of those coins. They are going to assuming you were the one that mined the 25 BTC, and are going to ask you for explanations of the other BTC, such as if you spent them, still had them, etc. 
Using a mixing service or a tumbling service would reduce the ability to track the coins, however that is a centralized service, and the service's integrity could get compromised. 
@_date: 2014-10-07 16:35:50
Thats because your actions are miniscule in the grand scheme of things. 
Coinbase used to have a direct link to Bitstamp. Like, they used their API to set pricing, and if you could fuck with what Bitstamp's API said, you could change the price on Coinbase. 
I dont think Coinbase and Circle are that intertwined with any one exchange anymore, but they are definitely not just using coins that are being bought and sold on their website, nor are they 100% buying coins OTC. When a lot of people are buying from Coinbase and Circle, orders are being placed on the exchanges.
As far as Celium trader and LocalBitcoins, most of those people are doing the same thing, either buying from Coinbase or Circle, or they are getting them from an exchange. Some might be early adopters cashing out, and some might be mining, but most are just serving as a broker between you and the exchange. Same thing with bitcoin ATMs and vending machines.

Be warned, they are also closing all associated accounts, as well as any accounts you have ever been a signer on, and any accounts of anyone who has shared an account with you, as well as anyone who has shared an account with them. Thankfully, that is as far as it goes. 
Here is how I know:
Shortly after I received my letter, my mother who was a signer on my account years ago, also received a similar letter. She had closed her account about three years ago, but last year opened an account that she shared with my sister. My sister then received the same letter. I have never had any banking connection with my sister, and my mother had no Chase accounts for a few years before she opened an account with my sister. 
Its not accounts with the same name as you though, my father did not have his account closed (my mother, nor I have ever shared an account with him at Chase), and to my knowledge, my brother did not have his account closed (not that he would say anything to me?). My wife, who shares an address with me, did not have her account closed, though she never updated her account to reflect that we had gotten married. 
Chase will go after the accounts of everyone you have shared an account with, and anyone they have shared an account with. They will also close all investment accounts, credit cards, loans, and mortgages.

Anyone who sells Bitcoin knows that there is always a shadowy element to it.

Hopefully Circle will provide some competition and force Coinbase to straighten up. Their PSA annoyed the hell out of me. Even when Bitcoin was $100 they allowed 50 BTC/Day, or about $5,000. They reduced that to about $2,000/Week when they initially switched to the 10 BTC/week. Now it is down to ~$1,000 a week. 
If fraud is still such a big problem, they need to institute credit checks for instant. Until then, they are just frustrating those of us who have been loyal. 
Edit: I emailed them to up my limit. We shall see how that goes. I spend a lot in Bitcoin, and I do a lot of trading, so I have some significant volume with them. I have also been listed on their White Hat page. If they are going to do limit increases, I think I would be a perfect candidate. We shall see how sincere they were being when they said that.

Dude, calm the fuck down. Read through several of the Coinbase "hacked" account threads. It is a common theme. As far as how Authy works, nothing about it is inherently insecure. I have *dozens* of accounts setup. I have been using it for well over a year. I have added it and recovered it on multiple devices. I use it *every day*. To top it all off, I just helped my wife set it up last night, so I just went through it all again, so I remember exactly how it all works. 
Do some research. Read about how Google Authenticator works. As I said, I have been using it for over a year to protect a fairly sizeable amount of BTC, as have others. Authy is not the security concern it, it is how users chose to setup their security. Hell, my Coinbase (and Blockchain) email addresses were even on one of the leaked MtGox lists, and they haven't been broken into. Again, if Authy was a problem, I would be a prime target. 
@_date: 2014-06-25 19:23:19
You misunderstand how this works. 
Authy requires a verification to add a device. Each additional device can be authenticated with another device. Authy also requires a "master password" to encrypt your Authy files on those devices. That file, encrypted client side, is synced to your other devices. Someone needs to know this password, and authorize another device, in order to gain access to your 2FA.
From there, 2FA works just like any other Authenticator app does. You add the 2FA code (that QR code, or the authorization code that is listed) and input the first 2FA code that is generated. When you go to log in, it requests a 2FA code generated from one of your authorized devices. 
This is indeed 2FA, because you are required to enter your password, then you are required to enter a security code from another device (or app, as they do have a Chrome app for PCs). That second code, the Authy or Google Authenticator Code, is the 2nd authorization, as only someone who has an authorized device and your Authy master password, would have access to this.

This cant/wont work. They would need to obtain a federal money transmitters license, which they I would assume they dont already have (their business model doesnt require it), then they would need to comply with state laws. Then they would need to update all of their machines to support it, and supply training to their current customer service team. For what? A very, very tiny amount of money to be made from a payout method that very few people would use?
This has been floated several times before, and its not happening.

As it should be. 
However, we should not be encouraging such reckless investment by people who are not equipped for the loss, yet could benefit the most from bitcoin when it is more developed. The easiest way to burn someone on Bitcoin is for them to lose their entire life savings when they really need it the most.

Off chain transactions have a place, but I do think it leaves a little to be desired. For small amounts, it can allow a transaction without a fee, which is convenient. For large amounts, it allows no risk, no confirmation transactions. 
What I would like to ultimately see from companies like Coinbase and others that hold private keys is for them to still submit the transaction to the network, but know that it can be instantly available to the other party since the sender does not have the private keys and therefore has no way to double spend the transaction. That would still allow some of the benefits, while keeping the transaction on the network. I think this will be much more feasible once transaction fees are floating and cheaper, and the block size has been increased to make room for miniscule sized transactions. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 18:53:03
Professionalism is important, however, this is the way that bitcoin transactions are typically done. It is not going to look odd or unprofessional to anyone who is using it. While it might generate some press, I highly doubt that it will generate enough new customers or enough in savings to justify spending $500 on a terminal. You also have to keep in mind that OP is going to have to pitch this to a skeptical father, so keeping costs to a minimum are going to be paramount.

Mining is a poor investment, and you probably shouldn't be putting a significant amount of money into bitcoin either. While most of us believe in the long term viability of bitcoin, it sounds like he really needs that money to be secure, as he doesn't have much else to work with. That old adage of don't invest more than you can afford to lose very much applies here. What would he do it something happened that drove the price down significantly? What would he do if he had an emergency while the price was temporarily down? Can he afford a significant loss? 
Shift a small portion of his portfolio to holding bitcoin, and talk to a financial advisor about the rest. Do not pressure him into anything, because you don't want him to feel resentment towards you if it doesn't turn out like you anticipated.

Think about this for a second, in a decentralized exchange, how the fuck are you going to get paid fiat? Meet person to person? Mail cash in the mail? These are all options for purchasing bitcoin, but it is not remotely practical for an "exchange".

Bitcoin is no where remotely close to a credible threat to the USD right now. There have not been actions taken against bitcoin in the context of it being a threat to the USD. The government is concerned about criminal use and money laundering right now, that is it. 
More power to you for having your own opinion, but paranoid shit like this makes us look like a bunch of whackjobs. If we want bitcoin to grow to a point where it is a credible threat to the dollar, or to where it is "to big to fail", we need to attract Average-Joes, and it is pretty damn hard to do that when the community comes off as the insane looking for a cure to what ails them.

Bitcoin is still easier for the consumer though, which was your original point. For the merchant, he just saved some money on transaction fees. If he wants return business, he can present you with the option of providing your email address, but he doesnt get to force it on you.

The problem is that with bigger merchants, there is no way they are paying 3%, and there is no way Coinbase is charging them 1%. For Coinbase, this is puts them in a difficult spot to make money, so the squeeze is probably on the consumer. 
If Dish pays 1.5% for credit cards, and Coinbase is charging 0.5%, then Dish has no upside (other than publicity) to offer a 1% discount. Similarly, Coinbase has no upside to offer free "buy back" to the customer, because they are already making very little money on the sale.

Transactions wouldnt confirm. If one person started mining, the difficulty would likely be far to high for them to consistently find blocks. As more people resumed mining, blocks would be found more often. Eventually it would be time for a difficulty adjustment, and the network would adjust difficulty downward to account for the lost time and lower hash rate. This could take months, depending on how much of the network had been restored.

* Different wallets have different uses. Mobile wallets are great for spending. Desktop wallets are great for storing funds that you wont regularly access. Cold wallets and paper wallets are wallets that havent been exposed to the internet. These are best for storage and security. I personally use several wallets, for my mobile, I use Greenaddress.it, for my desktop I use Electrum, and I also use cold storage as well. What you use will depend on your use and the amount of BTC you are storing. Always remember that if you dont control your private keys, the bitcoins are not yours!
* Bitcoins are infinitely divisible. A "bit" (or uBTC) is a smaller unit of a bitcoin, as is a milibit (mBTC), and a "satoshi" (smallest unit). You can purchase bitcoin in any quantity, and you can refer to it how you wish. You can also say 0.001 BTC instead of 1mBTC. I prefer using BTC or mBTC, but others like bits. 
* Exchange will depend on how much you are purchasing and where you are. If you are in the US, use Coinbase. If you are in Europe, use Kraken. Others will tell you to use LocalBitcoins or other in person trade options, but beware that you will pay a premium for using those services. 
* MtGox is a bankrupt exchange that potentially stole funds. This is why I said earlier that if you dont control the private keys, you dont control the BTC. There isnt a ton that you need to know, as most of that has blown over. The takeaway is that you shouldnt store coins where you dont control the keys, and if there is ever evidence that a company is running out of money or unable to meet their responsibility, you should no longer trust them.

I have said it before, and I will say it again: The larger the organization, the more it costs to implement Bitcoin. Amazon would have thousands of customers service reps to train, documentation to write, accountants who would need to get up to speed, and programmers who would need to understand Bitcoin in order to maintain the implementation. Furthermore, Amazon is to large of a company to just accept a third party implementation like Coinbase or Bitpay, they would want to write their own backend, which would cost a significant amount of money. 
All of this for what? A million or so people who may or may not spend a ton in Bitcoin at Amazon? 
It will be a long time before Amazon feels it is worth it. They are the retail juggernaut, they have no *need* to accept Bitcoin, other than being forward thinking. They would be doing Bitcoin a favor, and would not see a return on their investment for quite sometime.

The problem would be that Coinbase stands to gain nothing by allowing universities from India to receive free BTC. In the US it is easily justified as a promotional expense, since they derive income from US based customers.

My wife has a farm of phones with broken screens that run ad programs. Honestly, she has made more money off of each of those phones than I have made buying ASICs, most of her phones ROI in less than a month. 
Edit: 
For everyone asking me how/what she is doing, she doesn't like to spell it out for people, because of fear that it will become to common and they will reduce payouts. The information is pretty available. Basically there are apps that will pay you for watching videos. She lets those run 24/7 and periodically checks on them to ensure they are still running. Certain things ensure higher payouts, like using newer model phones. 
Most of the apps use gift cards as payouts, some allow Paypal. 
While all of this info is available online, I wont spell it out for you. Do some research, it's not hard to find. 
Oh, one app has even announced plans to have payouts in Bitcoin as an option.

Thanks for the tip. I agree that it is good that they are allowing for user preference. 
When the mBTC conversation was had when we approached $1,000, mBTC was overwhelmingly supported, and the general consensus was that uBTC was to small. I still fail to understand why even a minority have shifted their opinion when BTC is currently down in value. It will be YEARS before mBTC is to large. uBTC doesn't make things much easier anyways, instead it forces you to use drawn out places for larger numbers, where mBTC allows you to simply not use a decimal point. If anything, dealing with large numbers will be more confusing for most people, as the euro and the US (and Australian, Canadian, and New Zealand) dollar has a much larger base unit. Bits is like trying to pay with pennies, but worse because they are even smaller.

I love food, and that is my biggest problem with trying to lose weight. If I have a bite of cake, I want to eat cake until I am full. If I am eating a steak, I want to continue eating steak. If I sit down for a bowl of cereal, I can eat the entire box. I have been wanting to try this for a while, it fascinates me, and I could see it being good for like a week on, a week off, as a supplement to dieting. Not eating food at all would make it impossible to binge. My biggest problem is the cost! I know they are just starting out, and they need larger orders, but ideally you could buy 1-3 days worth, so you could spend $20 instead of $65 and see how you like it. I have a hard time plunking down $65 for a week of food that could potentially taste awful (to me). So for now, this is a pass, even though they accept bitcoin.

You dont need to have a password setup each time you go to get your 2FA password. The 2FA password is generated on the device. That is the security, someone needs the device. 
Someone cant authorize a device on your account without approval from another device. In other words, they would need a text, phone call, or notification on your other Authy device. 
As far as I know, the people that got hacked used Google Voice (or similar) on their Coinbase account. The attacker then made a request to remove the 2FA, and utilized the also compromised Google Voice account to verify and remove the 2FA. All of your accounts should be tied to an actual phone, Coinbase and Authy included.

Utilities are regulated differently. 
It is poor business practices to refuse customers, but banks have every right to do it. You are not entitled to banking services. They have no obligation to serve you. If they feel that you are a liability to them in some form, whether that form is appearances (IE a bank might not want to be associated with a firearms dealer or adult entertainment) or risk (IE a bank may not want to deal with the hassles of additional AML monitoring for a bitcoin business, or a higher risk for charge backs for adult entertainment) they dont have to serve you. 
If you dont like that, then push for more regulations on the banking industry, find a bank that works better for you, or simply avoid banks.

The point with dollar cost averaging is not to invest more money, its to invest the same amount over a period of time. You are not making a fair comparison, you should be looking at DCA vs buying the same amount of BTC at $1005, in which case, yes, your losses are less.

I trade both ways, I keep a small amount of cash on hand for when Im buying. Not a whole lot of people selling to me these days, but during the bubble, I hardly had to deal with Coinbase.

I think that for many people even $10k is a life altering amount. Rich may not be the correct word, but to college students or other young people, $10k would be a huge windfall. For those of us who have many more coins, even $5k or $1k per coin can lead to a life altering amount of money. I mean, if we see a rise to $5k, I would have enough money to pay off my house!

You have to approach it like you do mining equipment. First, operate under the assumption that in 1-2 years bitcoin will be significantly easier to obtain, therefore your ATM will be worth less (or nothing). Second, consider if you would be able to receive more bitcoin by simply buying the coin than you would earn in charging fees for using your ATM. This assumes that the goal is to generate dollars which will be used to purchase bitcoin. Finally, you have to make sure you account for all of your fees. This includes, but is not limited to wire transfer fees to get money onto the exchange, exchange fees once you have funds on the exchange, regulatory compliance (if applicable), legal fees (forming a business, receiving business licenses, etc), taxes, and rental space for your location. 
When you factor in the cost of an affordable one way ATM, around $5,000, you would have to charge a 5% premium and do $100k in sales to earn the $5k back. That is before expenses. If you assume it is going to cost you about 0.5% in wire fees and exchange fees, you have to either charge 5.5%, or you have to do about $110k in sales. If you tack on $1k in start-up expenses, as well as the 0.5% in fees, you have to have $130k in sales to break even. 
Do you see where I am going with this? 
It seems the only way to be profitable with an ATM is be first to market in a larger metro area, based in a location that gets high foot traffic from tech-savvy people. It certainly can be done, but it isnt a surefire business model.

The service that Robocoin sells is more about the keeping people out of jail, and less about the ATM, at least in the US market. Im working on a project to setup ATMs in my local area, and the keeping me out of jail part is the biggest challenge. There are half a dozen bitcoin ATMs on the market, but Robocoin is the ONLY unit that has a complete compliance program included. There are others coming, but all of the ATMs in the US will have a similar level of probing.

Good points. I make a point to not engage in ANY illegal activity, bitcoin related or not :) 
I havent ever filled out a suspicious person report, but before I was resisted I did turn down business after someone repeatedly mentioned "Road". I think anyone who sells bitcoin must understand that is some of your customer base, and you need to be conscious of that. On the same hand, you cant interrogate your customers. If a customer hasnt come forward and said "Im buying drugs!" there really isnt a whole lot you can do. This is what I am afraid of, (hypothetically) some jackass is buying BTC from me, and using that BTC to buy drugs. I dont know what they are doing, just that they have a weekly order of $1,000. Jackass gets busted on the drugs, police ask about how he was obtaining them. Now I am being investigated for something I had no part of. 
I need to find a similarly paying second source of income. I tell myself this constantly. I love evangelizing for BTC. I love helping people out. I dont want to stop that. Stuff like this scares the shit out of me though. Im trying to run an honest, legitimate business, yet I can easily see scenarios where I could get screwed, and I have no idea how to prevent that (short of shutting down). 
ATMs maybe? That would collect the KYC info and keep the human element out of it, that way someone cant subjectively say "Well you should have known this customer was no good".

Spite? The fuck if I know. They closed out the last ~$1500 I had on a loan, and requested payment within 30 days. The rep, who had some special title that I cant recall, asked me if I had other loans, cards, or mortgages with Chase. The explanation they gave me was that typically Chase extends favorable terms to long time account holders in good standing, however they have the right to revoke those terms at any point, and since they were ending their relationship with me, they would be "exercising their rights" to close any and all of my associated accounts. 
I didnt have a mortgage with them, and something tells me they cant just call a mortgage like they can a small loan, so that may have been bullshit. If you had a special interest rate or something, they may be able to screw with that. 
Basically they made it very clear that they did not want any of my money, at all, ever. I was never a big customer, but I had around $20k with them, its not like a poor student with merely a free checking account.

Yes and no, they definitely gained new customers so that has to be taken into account. We also know that Coinbase contributed, but we don't know how much.

It is extremely *dangerous* to tell someone that bitcoin is going to succeed based on your *assumption* that because it has done well in the past, that it will do well in the future.

I trade on Bitfinex currently, so that wouldnt be to burdensome. The biggest problem is transitioning over. I dont exactly have $10k in cash (all bitcoin) and I was utilizing Coinbase to reduce the exchange rate risk. I would basically have to split my cash in half to keep BTC on hand, and cash in the exchange to mitigate that risk.

Paper wallets can be generated and printed. Most people like to do them using a Linux Live CD while their computer is disconnected from the internet. [This is one that a lot of people use.](
Multiple wallets are a good idea. Bitcoins are easy to move, and infinitely divisible, so even if you only have one, you can store 0.5 BTC on a paper wallet, 0.25 in your Web or Mobile wallet, 0.25 on your desktop wallet. Or however you want to do it. If you later want to spend 0.5BTC, you can just combine your mobile and desktop wallets. Make sense?

We dont have a lot of data to go on. Last time it did cause the price to rise, but there is no certainty we will have the same effect. I think unless we have a a significant price increase between now and then, it will become unprofitable for certain smaller miners, and those running older ASICs, which may cause some to drop out. On the larger mining front, those that almost have to sell a significant amount of their mining proceeds to cover costs, they may alter their selling patterns causing a small disruption in supply. However, we must look at how much mining really impacts supply. Currently roughly 3600 new coins are mined each day. That is around $1.6M worth of coin. While this is a market moving amount if it is all dumped on one exchange at one time, it isnt a huge amount. I dont have numbers handy, but it certainly is nothing compared to the downward pressure that Coinbase and Bitpay exert on the market, and not even all of these coins are being sold! 
I think at this point the mining reward has a very minimal impact on price, and aside from certain psychological aspects, it should have a minimal impact on price.

We might get a period where there is silence from both sides, but if PBOC thinks that BTC is getting to big, they will not hesitate to knock it back a few notches. Dont ever fool yourself into thinking that we have moved past the China drama. 
Slow growth. I think we are somewhere around July of 2013. Hopefully some calm and sideways movement for a month or so.

Very, very wrong. Every sale you make is a taxable event. I find it easier to keep two ledgers, one that I sell with and only buy back the Bitcoin I sold. That gives me profit in dollars, which I use for my tax basis. After I take out my estimated taxes (you should also be paying quarterly estimated taxes) I use the remaining money to buy more Bitcoin or sell, which I record in a different ledger. If I opt to move some of my "profit coins" into my selling funds, I make a note of that in both ledgers. 
Don't even think about skirting taxes. You are raising flags with the bank, whether you see it or not. They are reporting back to the IRS, and you will be at a significantly higher risk of audit. The IRS will be expecting you to declare some form of additional income. Hire a good tax guy with experience going through audits. If necessary also talk to a tax lawyer. They will explain exactly what your risks are and how to best minimize them.

Budget? Robocoin is the most common two way ATM, but they are expensive. Robocoin is the one that is in Vancouver. 
Lamassu is much less expensive ($5k USD), but it only dispenses bitcoin, and does not all people to sell bitcoin back to the machine. The interface, from what I have seen in demos, is pretty simple. The management panel looks very well designed, however it wasnt completed when I was given a demo. I know they shipped units before it was fully completed with the intention of updating them later. Im not sure where they are at in that process. 
Bitaccess and Genesis 1 both look promising in the $10k-$15k range, but I have yet to talk to anyone who has used one in person, nor have I requested a sample or demo interface for either unit to evaluate it myself.

Difficulty only adjusts based on the previous round, so if Round A completes to quickly, the difficulty adjusts so that Round B will complete on time. The problem is, while Round B is occurring, additional hash power is being added to the network, so Round B still completes to quickly. The difficulty then adjusts, trying to get Round C to complete in the proper amount of time. The same problem occurs, and Round C completes quickly. 
Theoretically, an occasional decline in difficulty would help mitigate this problem, as the difficulty might not adjust down far enough as more hash power is removed, creating the same problem in reverse. In actuality, the network is still growing at an extreme rate, and we will probably not see difficulty decreases for some time.

This is a little misleading. He is invested in a fund that invested in Bitpay. I was hoping (expecting) to see a specific comment, or to hear that he made an individual investment. That is not the case. This isnt to say that he doesnt support bitcoin, and at worse is probably agnostic towards it (else he would lobby or pull funds prior to the investment in Bitpay). 
It is important to make this distinction. Just because someone is investing in a fund that invests in bitcoin businesses, that does not mean they directly support bitcoin or believe in its long term viability. Businesses bring in income, which add value, which is what investors are looking for. I may not specifically agree with coal as a fuel source, but coal related businesses make money, therefore they are part of my investment portfolio. This is the same thing.

The reason that is the case is because of people like yourself. Selling Bitcoins on Mt Gox is a huge liability because you *absolutely can not* get dollars out of Mt Gox. 
It will be a hit, but it is better than not getting your money at all. If you have a substantial amount to cash out (greater than $2500 or so) you can avoid the middleman and get verified on Bitstamp. You will get slightly more than you would on Coinbase, but you will have to pay international wire transfer fees.

Similarly to how Neo makes money, probably. It would probably have to make money on the merchant side, encouraging them to take Bitcoin for less than they could do credit card transactions. 
The biggest problem is without having your money in advance, they would essentially be loaning you money until your payment cleared from the legacy banking system. Coinbase does this now with their instant purchase feature, but as others pointed out, fees are pretty bad. 1% to buy, 1% for the merchant to cash out. Now, if your merchant is giving you a discount, it could work in your favor. Gyft gives 3% rewards points back, so I often spend Bitcoin on Gyft and immediately buy it back. I tend to end up with about 0.75% back in rewards, when you account for all of the fees.

I have two questions:
1. What problem do you have with scanning a QR code and having it populate the amount and the receiving address? This is a common method with merchant apps, and you do not need to input anything, just scan the code and click "Send"
2. Why would you want to give the ability to pull money from your wallet in an irreversible payment system? If you dont have the ability to at least double check the transaction, you wouldnt know if they charged you the wrong amount until after the fact, which could prove difficult to retrieve your funds. It introduces a trust requirement in a transaction where it is not necessary. For instance, you could tell your barista to give himself a $1 tip. You arent checking the transaction, so he decides to give himself a $5 tip. This stuff happens with credit cards, but it is no big deal because they are designed to take first and ask questions later. Bitcoin is the exact opposite. 
What you describe would require a third party processor, as it will never be implemented (in the manor you describe) into the protocol. Its doable, I just dont understand why you would want to do it that way.

I agree. They could also allow you to buy/sell all day and show an amount that will be taken via ACH at the end of the day. So if you buy 1BTC at $700 it would show -$700.

Then it is one ACH transaction instead of several, and it allows people to trade throughout the day.

Have you ever looked at the blockchain? It's not difficult to identify an address or an owner and work backwards. Stolen coins have been tracked in the past, the FBI seized coins were identified and tracked, and even some of the MtGox coins have been identified and tracked. If someone is looking at you close enough to want to track your spending, chances are they can. Bitcoin is arguably more traceable, since the blockchain is public. It relies on security through obscurity, but that provides very little, if any, true security. It provides the illusion of anonymity, but it certainly is not anonymous and it certainly is traceable.

Nothing like this, but American Express was more than happy to charge back an entire month of my ATT uVerse service after I had 10 day outage and was having some issues getting a refund. Its certainly not the same situation, but most of the major credit card issuers (American Express, Discover, Chase, and BofA) are all pretty willing to do charge backs if your side of the story sounds reasonable, and you made an effort to resolve it with the merchant beforehand.

This is yet another interesting take on why P2Pool and any future decentralized mining solutions could be essential. Any large miner could be put in this position. However, if 51% of the network is run off of P2Pool, there would be no centralized miners for law enforcement (or others) to "attack".

Again, huge premium. 
He could buy money orders and send them to CampBX or CoinMKT, but then he is assuming extra risk. 
When Circle launches, he could use his prepaid card to make the purchases, but he would still have to pay processing fees, and Circle may deny him as well, if they use the same system as the banks. 
We talk about the under banked being a huge market here, but the reality is, there is no reliable and affordable way for the underbanked to acquire BTC. This guy's best solution is to do what he keeps doing, or to see if he can get his employer to pay part or all of his check in BTC.

I have put some thought into this before, and determined that there wasnt really a good way to do it. Obviously there is. It isnt ideal, since if both parties colluded, they could steal from you (think if your merchant was eBay, and Paypal was the payment processor! They could still freeze funds, or steal from you). This would minimize that risk, especially since you could theoretically have several clearinghouses, or even run a clearinghouse node on your own server, if everyone agrees to some open standard. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 19:32:26
Your point? They arent going to be operating ATMs to achieve this, they would be much more likely launder money through misreporting profits in legit businesses they operate, then covering the laundered fiat to digital currency. Someone still has to operate the ATM, and operating it outside of the regulatory framework for the sole purpose of laundering money is going to attract a hell of a lot more attention than doing what already works.

It's a simple, but good product. It will definitely be the go to service for new users, it's simpler to understand than Coinbase, everything is instant, and if you use a credit card, you can buy BTC within five minutes of clicking the "Sign Up" button. 
I think they screwed up by making availability promises far to early, but they are definitely delivering. Be patient, it's not vaporware, and while it won't really change anything for the current crop of bitcoiners (other than some mold convenience with instant purchases) it will change it for the wives, girlfriends, parents, friends, etc. It's simple enough that anyone can use it.

You absolutely did nothing wrong, and I hope I didn't come off that way. In May, Mt Gox was one of the only games in town, and there weren't huge issues. It isnt your fault that they are incapable of processing withdraws, nor is it your fault that they have been less than transparent about the true time, if ever, it will take to process a withdraw. 
Transfer out what you need now, but if you can wait on the rest, there are periods where it won't be as big of a hit. Occasionally the price disparity nears 2-5% instead of 10%+.

I don't think you understand what the ECB announcement was about. These negative interest rates only apply to commercial banks storing excess money in the central bank. This isn't going to impact individuals, and banks aren't going to have any interest in storing their money in bitcoin. They will either pay the interest, invest in their economy like the central bank desires, or they will switch their extra cash to yen, dollars, pounds, etc, and store the cash with an institution that will pay them interest or allow them to store their cash at 0%.
It will be a long time, if ever, that banks abandon storing their money in the US dollar for bitcoin. 
This announcement means nothing to us.

Two major things happen. The first is fractional reserve. You deposit $10,000 dollars. The bank decides that you will probably only want to withdraw 10% at any given time, so they loan out the remaining $9,000. Now your account says $10,000 but another account also says $9,000 and is backed by your same dollars. If you and the person they loaned the $9,000 went to the bank and wanted to withdraw all of your money, the bank wouldn't have $19,000 to give you both, they would only have the $10,000 you deposited. Obviously this is small scale, but this is essentially how it works, but with millions of people all depositing and borrowing money. 
Another way money is created out of thin air is through the buy back of bonds. A bond is sold for $10,000, and that $10,000 is spent. Later on, the Fed will buy that bond back, however it won't be with that original $10,000 or with some sort of return on investment with that $10,000. They will simply issue a "payment" and the seller will essentially be given permission to adjust their account up by $10,000. In other words, the government received money the first time, which was spent, but when they go to pay it back, the money does not actually need to be there. 
@_date: 2014-08-23 16:31:40
It doesn't work exactly like that. 
In the debit card scenario, the card provider is transmitting funds of a verified customer to the bank or account of the merchant, who is also verified. 
In the Bitcoin scenario, the customer is transmitting funds to a third party (Bitpay, Coinbase, etc) who then transfers the funds to a verified customer. If from there the merchant wanted to give the customer funds from the register, he becomes part of exchange circle, and either needs to be an authorized agent of Bitpay/Coinbase/etc and perform KYC and follow the rest of the rules, or they need to be registered themselves, perform KYC, etc. 
Neither of those things will happen, because Coinbase and Bitpay can't verify without routine and expensive audits that the merchant is actually holding up their end.

I wont be surprised if it comes to fruition, but Netflix is a big player. They arent struggling, they dont *need* hype or news attention. If they accept BTC, it will be purely for the sake of accepting it. I dont think they would do so with the anticipation of gaining more subscribers, though they may hope to lower transaction fees for a small percentage of their current subscribers (myself included!). 
It would also be very good for Pandora,. I could see that working well for them.

Here is something I said to another user earlier, I encourage *everyone* to participate! 
Send a physical letter to Lawsky civilly asking him to consider the public comments being made by some of the big players over the next 45 days, praise New York for being the financial epicenter that it is, and kiss his ass a little. A real person will read that letter, even if it isnt Lawsky himself. You can even request acknowledgement that they received the letter, you might actually get that acknowledgement. If we can send a few hundred (or more) letters, it will draw the positive attention that we need. As someone active in my own state's politics, this does work. 
[Lawsky's office address is as follows](
New York State Department of Financial Services
One State Street 
New York, NY 10004-1511 
Next, get others on board to stop the negativity. We have journalists reading this sub every day, we have prospective bitcoiners reading it. It is important that we keep things civil. 
Finally, educate yourself on what the proposed regulations say. If someone asks you about it, be able to accurately explain it and why it is excessive. Make pulls on the Github version, come up with something that will work better. Unfortunately that is about all we can do, but it is important that we do everything we can, regardless of how small it is. 
Outside of that, we should have all of the big players in each of communities uniting in a coordinated message. I think using the Github version of the proposal makes a lot of sense to organize a version of the rules that we could all live with. 
Im not a Doge guy, but you are right, your members are brilliant when it comes to getting odd media attention. I would suggest putting those talents to good use and organizing some sort of physical demonstration in New York. Perhaps coordinate with the Satoshi Square people to get a huge meetup to occur outside of the NYDFS HQ. Combine that with a media blitz, and it should get some positive attention. 
Lastly, and this is more an thing, we need to avoid negativity or profanity directed towards people. That isnt how we want people to see us.

Register on Circle and Coinbase. Buy your maximums. Start verifications so that this wont be a problem in the future. Next, use LocalBitcoins and MyCelium to find some local trades. Are you near a city that has a bitcoin ATM? Contact the operator of the ATM and see if they can arrange something for you. 
I would only buy a minimum (if anything) from sources like ATMs, LocalBitcoins, MyCelium traders, etc. The markup there is huge, and you could probably wait a week for some of your verifications to come through on Circle and Coinbase.

Bitcoin still doesnt make any sense. It is a small part of their user base, and unless they are planning on simultaneously launching an exchange, it doesnt fit in their model. Why would Amazon make a bitcoin wallet for the sole purpose of making a bitcoin wallet? 
Again, for the reasons stated, they wont be adding bitcoin payments any time soon, so why would they build a wallet? 
This is simply the first iteration of a new platform for them, and it will improve in time, just like Google Wallet did, just like any other new platform that gets released does.

I would say they left the realm of "mean well" When they started trying to sell pre-orders of new product lines when they still had a backlog of old product. At that point it is greed. If they meant well, they would develop the new tech and not take orders until it was ready or they finished the backlog of existing orders.

Many Conservatives are in the right mindset to get into BTC. I come from a Conservative family, and ideologically, they are right there.
As far as the IRS thing, that isn't why it appeals, but I would be lying if I said that many ultra right wing people will be really into the idea of finding a way to avoid taxes using bitcoin. I'm not sure that is an image we really want to be associated with though.

The issue isn't black and white. Bitstamp's survival, for the time being, is very important for the short term survival and success of bitcoin. Again, if they have a major blunder, it could hurt a lot of users, and it would generate a lot of negative press. 
We need to send the message that the anal probing is unacceptable, but they also need to know that they won't lose customers once they remove a couple of the most outrageous practices. If they feel that those who don't like it have already moved on, they have no incentive to fix it.

I agree with you to a certain extent. It is probably on their radar, they may be looking at it here and there, but I doubt they are actively working on something at the moment.

I dont think you understand how inflation/deflation work. The total number of bitcoin that will exist is capped. At any given time, we can figure out exactly how many bitcoin exist. It doesnt matter if one entity stops selling or circulating bitcoin. That isnt deflation. That simply removes those coins from circulation. They still exist, and we still assume they could always be reintroduced into circulation. Since we know they can reenter circulation at anytime, we also dont call it inflation when they are reintroduced, since the total number of bitcoin existing hasnt changed.

This. So hard. Make it a completely reasonable offer, but make it in Bitcoin. "Well, there is 1 BTC sealed in here, and I think the coin is worth X as a collector item, so if you give me Y, it's yours" X and Y should be BTC denominated. Be prepared to answer "What is that in real money"  with the current exchange rate, but be clear you will only accept payment in Bitcoin.

I got one of these a few weeks back. $500 from a customer I have served half a dozen times before. They even did a legit transaction earlier in the day (different dollar amount, different branch). They insisted they were in a hurry, and that the lady at the bank was having problems with the computer. Yup, screwed. I wouldn't have released it if I didn't have prior history. 
LocalBitcoins bounced back and forth about whether or not they could provide me with his info. I think they made the right call not providing it, but I wish I could have sought to collect it. He had a verified phone number and email address. LocalBitcoins staff did repeatedly ask him for a second copy of the receipt. No response. 
Oh, to top it all off, I took negative feedback on the trade after leaving him negative. He clearly pulled the same thing on a few others that day, as I checked and he later received several.

Im not trying to be crass, but dont you think that if the solution was as simple as plunking down $3,000 the situation would be resolved by now? They are selling them amongst themselves, not for the money, but so others can have "wives", and to prevent the girls from reentering a society that they disagree with. The Nigerian government needs to address the issue, they need to continue to put pressure on them, and the people need to understand that an evacuation notice for the schools is serious business. Im not trying to blame the victims, but it is my understanding that there was a notice for the schools in that region to close. Had they headed this warning, this wouldnt have occurred. Had the Nigerian government acknowledged the events, and not claimed that the girls had been rescued or freed a few days later, a resolution could probably have been reached by now. 
At this point, this has absolutely nothing to do with bitcoin, and I dont really understand why it is on our front page.

Historically maybe, but past performance doesn't indicate future success. News breaks that Bitcoin has a fatal flaw, Ghash.io is double spending everyone. The Litecoin people jump forward and say "Scrypt makes it much more difficult to gain 51%!" People move to Litecoin. This causes the BTC/USD pair to fall, and the BTC/LTC pair to gain in LTC's favor. Additionally, it likely makes LTC/USD rise, as people fleeing BTC buy in on Litecoins. 
Now if this were to happen, Ghash.io better have enough resources to hire private security, because there will be some pissed off people who just lost a lot of money.

Bitcoin is an insanely high risk investment, and people seriously forget that sometimes. Imagine this: You have a $100k mortgage. You happen to have $250k in bitcoin. You decide that bitcoin is forever, so you opt not to pay that mortgage off. Three months later, a massive vulnerability is discovered. A hard fork and block roll back is required to fix it. It doesn't go well. The price crashes by thousands of dollars, and over the next six months, merchants leave and the value dwindles to nothing. 
While I don't necessarily think this is a likely scenario, it is possible. Part of not investing more than you can lose is rebalancing your portfolio when an investment becomes so large that the money could change your life in a meaningful way, yet it still extremely risky, and could disappear in an instant. You don't know if bitcoin will still exist in a meaningful way in 10 years, but you will still have your 30 year mortgage.

Difficult and expensive to acquire. Yes, Coinbase isnt that difficult, but it does require effort, and then it requires you to spend 1% extra. For the average, every day user, why? Its easier for them to just continue to use their credit card. 
Circle could change this, but it still doesnt solve the problem of "Why should I buy bitcoin to spend them" assuming the person isnt ideologically motivated. Instant and free purchases will definitely make it easier for existing users, and might attract some new users, but it still isnt enough to go mainstream. If we want to attract new users, we are going to need payroll processing. We are going to need incentives for people to use BTC. Right now it is little more than a novelty for most users.

When we launch personal attacks at people who have betrayed us, we become a joke to the rest of the world.

It depends on what grounds they file the charge-back. Just because the poker site's TOS says it is fraudulent does not make it so, nor does it make it enforceable. It really has to do with how the credit card company views the transaction. As I said in a previous post, using the card on a gambling site may be a violation of the credit card company's TOS, which would probably result in the closure of his card account (and probably any associated bank accounts) if he attempted to charge back.

Its not an assumption, it is reality cemented in plainly obvious fact. The only time third party payment processors have ever been used is when they are already integrated into a shop that they acquire, and their customers are accustomed to using that method (Paypal for Woot is a good example).

Perhaps, but it sets a dangerous precedent. It still suggests that there are people, and I would assume it would be core developers with some serious backing, that would be willing to fundamentally violate the core principles in instances of "extraordinary mission". Where does it stop? When does it happen again? Do we set an arbitrary amount that can be lost? 
Lets assume that we are just retrieving these coins from a lost cold storage wallet, so we arent taking coins from thieves that may be spent or something like that. If another exchange came forward with a similar loss, would we indulge them? If we dont, they will cry foul, citing the previous precedent, and make accusations that those who supported the Gox bailout were only interested in recovering their own losses. If we allow it, then we are affirming that this is a new normal. 
Saving incompetent exchanges might win some support among users who were harmed. What about investors? What if Secondmarket lost access to a cold storage wallet? Or the Winklevii? Do they receive the same treatment? 
Every action taken in a hard fork will change things for generations (assuming bitcoin survives). We can not take such drastic measures to fix our immediate problems without thinking of the consequences. In the grand scheme of things, this is like cutting off your arm because you broke a finger. Yeah, your finger doesnt hurt anymore, but now you have drastically changed how your body functions, and it can never be the same again.

Use an escrow on the transaction. If the item never arrives, or it arrives damaged, you simply notify the company. If they are unwilling to fix it, you enter arbitration and get the transaction signed back to you. This is actually a fair compromise between consumer protection, and merchant protection. Often credit card companies will haphazardly allow chargebacks, even if the consumer made no effort to resolve. This prevents that, while still providing some consumer protection. 
Finally, no, you wouldnt need to create an account. Put in your shipping information, send the payment over, have an email address to send you notifications about order status. Need to prove you are the original purchaser later on? Sign a message with your address. 
There are some hurdles to mainstream adaption, but the points you are making are ones we have already solved in theory, it is now all about ensuring implementation is done correctly.

No. 
All three of those companies are large enough that they would develop in house solutions, Amazon especially. 
It could be a different company, but I think given Branson's recent investment, that is mostly. If not Virgin, I think Newegg is a good contender because they have previously expressed an interest, and one of their competitors (Tigerdirect) has already implemented Bitcoin. Virgin, if implemented across all product lines, would be huge. Airline tickets? Cell phone service? Music? Internet? It would be a huge gain with great publicity.

There is natural downward pressure created by Bitpay and Coinbase (and other similar services) cashing out coins that people have spent, and miners liquidating coins to cover costs. When buying pressure is insufficient to equal or outweigh this, the price slowly slides down.

What I am suggesting though is, if you are only buying a single block, why not buy it on the open market, where you know you can get it cheaper? Yes, if someone is buying the whole lot, they are probably willing to pay a premium. Therefore, if I am just bidding on a single block, I bid market/below market, and if I dont win, I scramble to buy on the open market. In fact, I would prestage fiat at Bitstamp and Bitfinex, and as soon as I found out that I didnt win, I would start buying. 
You would have to be a moron to be buying one 3k BTC block and bid more than 5-7% above market, since you can easily purchase 3k BTC on the open market with only 5% or so worth of slippage.

Margin Trading allows you to take loans from others to trade more BTC/USD than you actually own. When those trades are closed because the interest is piling up, the market is moving against people, etc. Those positions are liquidated so that the loaner can receive their original investment, plus interest, back. This causes a cascading reaction where the price falls further, thus requiring more liquidations. This can create a flash crash where many people are liquidated causing others to liquidate, etc until the bottom is reached.

I kid, well, it is. At this point we know Gox is a big fucking liability to the bitcoin community. If we can get Karpeles arrested, then we can prove that Gox was troubled and this is not systemic. If Karpeles is guilty of something, and I'm not sure he is, it would also encourage him to come clean. If he isn't guilty, he may be forced to admit to incompetence and explain what really happened. 
All of this assumes he would subject himself to US jurisdiction. The US has no real control over anything he needs, so he has little incentive to visit. It's doubtful he would be extradited over something like this, unless criminal acts become public.

The idea is that if you are trying to launder money, and they told you what you cant do, then you would simply avoid those things so you could continue to launder money.

You cant tell your customers what your protocol is.

I'm asking because you seem to have some idea of what you consider the "principles of the currency" when in reality, there is no such concept. The fundamentals of the currency are a decentralized digital currency that can operate completely trustless. Any notions of anonymity, privacy, or lack of government intervention you dream of are absolutely not fundamental principles. If that is what you seek, you live in a fantasy land. Those things can not exist on a massive scale, because the second something capable gets big enough, outside forces intervene, just like with bitcoin. 
So don't be an asshole, and try to realize that your opinion is not the only one. If that is what you want bitcoin to be, then boycott these devices, never use exchanges, and hide in the shadows all you want. It has absolutely no bearing on bitcoin as a whole.

FinCEN has issued guidance saying that bitcoin exchanges are MSBs. I think most ATM operators realize that also applies to them. Believe me, the operators would rather not have to collect info and deal with reporting requirements. That increases their overhead, which means they either profit less, or they pass that cost onto the customer, which makes it less likely customers will use their machines (in addition to the PITA identity verification steps)

Coinbase is a good start. My mom is really opened about trying new tech, and she is always interested in stuff I talk about, so she was pretty happy when I gave her one (back when they were ~$100). She learned pretty quickly how to use Coinbase, Blockchain, and Gyft. She did a lot of shopping over Christmas with it. She understood using different wallets when I explained it, she even understood the concept using a paper wallet, but we didn't go that route. My dad wants in now, so they are going to buy some to put on a paper wallet and hold. All of this is really to say that if you explain it, make good comparisons, and keep them engaged, there is no reason why the "every day"  person, whether your parents, a friend, or someone else.

So if the demand for dollars is outstripping the supply that the Fed creates, that would make dollars deflationary under your logic, correct? Supply and demand has nothing to do with inflationary vs deflationary.

It's similar. In your example, it makes the bottom part of the chain put pressure on the manufacturer to ensure the product is safe. The wholesaler and retailer have very little, if any, expectation to ensure the product is safe. They aren't expected to conduct tests or evaluations of the product. This is more closely related to how a car dealership isn't expected to do KYC for someone paying with a check, but they are if they pay with cash or gold or bitcoin.

Coinbase was at one time tied directly Bitstamp, so much so that if you did some wonky things with the Bitstamp order book, Coinbase would read it through their API and reflect it in their price, effectively allowing you to manipulate the Coinbase price. 
Coinbase has more liquidity themselves now, with a budding merchant system and much more broad user base. Still, their price seems pretty closely derived from Bitstamp, except during times of extreme volatility where they seem to cushion things a little bit more.

No doubt it will have an exposure effect, but if I think about some ordinary people that I know that have bitcoin, or at least know how to get bitcoin, I dont think they would bother for the meaningless savings. Look at it this way, if you setup a Coinbase repeating payment and completely ignored the 1% fee, the savings is only $0.01 after you pay the $0.15 "bank" fee. 
What I could see happening is people noticing that bitcoin is cheaper and looking to see if it is something they can use. They then realize that they like the concept of bitcoin. A few of those people will then decide they strongly like the ideology behind bitcoin, and for that reason decide to pay for Netflix with bitcoin, along with anything else they can find. 
Lets face it, there are still costs associated with obtaining bitcoin. At this stage there are very few instances where it is a "better deal" to make a purchase in Bitcoin, then buy more bitcoin. Most of us that do that do it simply out of ideology, not because there is an immediate financial gain.

I wrote a request up as well. Obviously I wouldn't waste time to much time fighting for the records, but I don't see why that information would be kept secret.

We should have a right to know that the price paid was fair, and that the buyer was selected in their merit (IE, the price they are willing to pay) and not through a back alley deal. I certainly don't believe that is the case, that is simply why it should be public. 
I don't see any reason for them to block the release of the price, but it will definitely take some time to come out with it.

I have said it before, the cost of implementation and maintenance of a BTC payment gateway for major companies (Amazon, Walmart, etc) are no where near the kinds of returns they would need. Dish kind of surprised me, but I guess they want to be in the public eye with some of the buzz going on with the Comcast/Time Warner deal, and the DirectTV/AT&amp;T deal.

No. People dont understand how this works. For the price to increase, we need more user adoption. Merchant adoption is great, but it doesnt *necessarily* bring users, at least not immediately. 
Paypal didnt really bring anything new to the table, outside of simplifying signing up new merchants to use Coinbase, Bitpay, or GoCoin. 
Now, if Paypal had added the ability to store bitcoin in your Paypal wallet, or if they had added the ability to purchase bitcoin, or if they had added some sort of escrow/safety net system to using bitcoin, that would have justified a price increase. 
Simply adding merchants is just another way for people to cash out.

Send a physical letter to Lawsky civilly asking him to consider the public comments being made by some of the big players over the next 45 days, praise New York for being the financial epicenter that it is, and kiss his ass a little. A real person will read that letter, even if it isnt Lawsky himself. You can even request acknowledgement that they received the letter, you might actually get that acknowledgement.

Next, get others on board to stop the negativity. We have journalists reading this sub every day, we have prospective bitcoiners reading it. It is important that we keep things civil. 
Finally, educate yourself on what the proposed regulations say. If someone asks you about it, be able to accurately explain it and why it is excessive.

Considering they have been less than up front about completing withdraws in dollars, I think it is fair to say they are insolvent to a degree. They were processing withdraws of Yen and to a lesser extent Euros. They could have had their bank convert Yen or Euros to dollars, but they did not. They chose to not cover their dollar withdraws. Why? That is speculation, but I dont think it is unreasonable to suspect that they didn't pay a large part of their liabilities simply because they did not have the money.

I could envision a system where you have a multisig wallet. The "pull" wallet has one of those keys, and when they need to pull money from your wallet they sign their portion of the transaction, and then send a notification to your wallet where you simply click "Proceed" to sign your half, and the transaction is submitted. Since it is a multisig transaction, they dont need to wait on confirmations, because you dont have the other key, and the entire premise of people/companies not being able to unknowingly pull money from your wallet remains in tact. 
A true "pull", requiring no interaction from you, should never happen, as it is extremely contrary to the rest of the ecosystem. This could of course happen with third party wallets or services. You could possibly construct a transaction in advance, but depending on the timeline, that could be problematic as well.

Mining is designed to be so competitive that people will add power until their costs are about equal to what it costs to purchase BTC. So, we either lose hashing power in the future, the price of bitcoin rises, or the costs of mining go down. Theoretically the volume of transactions increases, allowing more fees to be collected as well. 
Some people will mine at a loss for whatever reason, and some people will make a small profit. At this stage, mining will never be a get rich quick scheme though, as the mining market will stabilize itself. If it becomes cheaper to mine coins than it is to buy them, investors will do that. If it becomes cheaper to buy coins than it is to mine them, some will simply do that.

Scale back the chart a little bit and realize that bitcoin has only been around for 6 years, and may not exist in any meaningful form in 10, 20, 30 years. 
I say this lovingly as a member of the community, but the bitcoin community is a huge fucking echo chamber. It is **extremely** important that despite what we say around here, bitcoin is not inevitable. Social change when it comes to money is inevitable. The current system is flawed. Will that change be bitcoin? I want to believe it will be, but in reality, its probably more likely not than the likelihood that it is. Bitcoin is iteration one. Bitcoin as a *concept* is in beta. 
This will not be a popular opinion, but if you gave me the choice between putting all of my money into bitcoin or keeping all of my money in US dollars, I would hold onto every last penny. The likelihood of my dollars being worth *something* in 30 years is far more likely than my bitcoin being worth something. 
I apologize for the rant, but this seriously gets to me. Expecting the absolute inevitability of bitcoin makes us look out of touch with reality. This "comparison" might score highfives in our community, but outside, they are laughing at us. No, not the "first they laugh at you" kind of thing, they are laughing at us like people laugh at a stranger trying to stand up on ice after falling. They dont really care about the outcome, few of them will come to help, and they will deny having every mocked us if and only if we manage to succeed. In reality, they would rather watch us flounder around like a fish out of water. No one will make it easy for us, and the more entrenched we get, the more we assume inevitability, the more arrogant we appear, the less likely someone will be willing to step up and lend a hand. 
Arrogance is off putting, and that is exactly what posts like these are.

While I am sure that some of the regular shareholders will join in your sentiment, in fact, Im sure many will. I also believe that many already know that he is a little out there. This isnt the first time he has made his extreme libertarian views known, and I am not at all surprised about this. In fact, I expected it, and I think many other shareholders did as well. 
While his personal investment might show a tad bit of a conflict of interest, I dont think it shows anymore instability than a CEO making it known that they just invested in a crazy new start up. As far as keeping bitcoin on their balance sheets, he almost needed to put some of his own money where his mouth was, so that it didnt look like he was trying to use the company's money to further his views on something that he wasnt willing to risk his personal finances on as well. 
Lastly, Overstock isnt dying, but they arent doing great. They are struggling to compete. Bitcoin was a fresh new idea, and it got them a lot of publicity. I hope that continues to translate into more sales. Adding bitcoin to their balance sheets could be very positive for them. Some of the investors might like the mild exposure to bitcoin through Overstock, because it could pay off in a big way if bitcoin continues to go big. Similarly, it could seriously damage Overstock if it fails to perform when that money should have gone towards less riskier investments or cash reserves.

Time to learn, Ghash.io has a large amount of the mining power. If they maintain this power, they can cheat the network. People who are mining with them need to change their miners to solo, P2Pool, or a different pool. If that won't happen, Ghash.io needs to fix this internally. They could break up ownership of the pool, or dissolve it completely, among other things. 
If this isn't resolved, and they start doing bad things, Bitcoin will be in for a roller coaster of bad publicity.

Eh, depends on your perspective. As I just railed against Square, look at it from their side: There customers (the merchants) are used to paying 2.75%. Their customers are also hearing requests to take Bitcoin. These merchants want to take Bitcoin, because their customers (the consumers) are asking for it. They don't care about the other benefits, they just know everyone who takes Bitcoin gets press and a sales boost. 
Square wants to maintain their foothold. They make it cost nothing to take Bitcoin for their customers. Dead simple, just enable it and go. It's already a closed platform, and their customer (merchants) are used to paying the fees. It comes off as a win-win. 
Now, Square's merchant base are hands off people. There is a reason they are there, and not in their own e-commerce platform. Some of them may eventually wise up, but it is unlikely. This is what they know, these are the fees they know, nothing more, nothing less. Square sees it as a way to keep their merchants from fleeing, while still making bank. 
It is still sleazy, IMO

My biggest concern is how much exposure do we get? Forgive me, but Im not super familiar with the sport, so I dont know how much visibility sponsors get. My second concern, how much? Im willing to donate as much as $100 in BTC, if the exposure we gain from the price we pay makes sense. Doge paid $55,000 to have their giant logo on a car, for several hours. Based on that, I probably would say that anything more than $10k would be a waste, unless I am grossly misunderstanding the amount of exposure sponsors get.  
Like I said, Im not opposed. I would give $100 to the cause, as long as it makes fiscal sense.

I have a general disdain for dodge (the meme and the coin), but I will not down vote this, because it is a very valid point. Dodge is fun. It has virtually no value. It is definitely a fad. People are taking it very seriously though, which boggles my mind. 
Dodge lovers are also insanely annoying, and while I cant mash the downvote button enough times when I see a Dodge tip, it reminds me how annoying we must be to some people. Invading threads, leaving obnoxious tip bot confirmations, etc. Now, at least our tips are valuable, but that is a whole other thing. 
Finally, I think the Dodge charity drives are overblown. Yes, they have helped people, and that is great, but this notion that Dodge users are extremely charitable, and bitcoin users are grinches is simply not true. Seans Outpost has definitely received more charity money than the Dodge charity drives, and other organizations have also received generous amounts of bitcoin.

A bitcoin is just an entry in the blockchain, which is just a ledger that says "This address has this much". 
The first node was run by Satoshi, and he was distributing the software as well as information about the system via message boards and mailing lists. This was all in 2008/2009. Others ran nodes, and the early network was built. You can read a lot about this at the [Satoshi Nakamoto Institute's website](

Actually yes, I recently received a similar letter from my credit union informing me that they believed I was operating a bitcoin sales business (I was) and that my account would be closed. The only difference is the level of activity this took to trigger, I had performed maybe 10 local bitcoin transactions, in person, with subsequent Coinbase purchases. To put this into perspective, I sold using my Chase account for about 150 transactions over 6 months before receiving one of these letters. 
My credit union allowed me to keep my account, which is a testament to the fact that you can call and actually talk to someone who matters at a credit union. I had stopped selling on LocalBitcoins a few prior, and was able to explain the situation. That doesn't change the fact that they were willing to take the same actions as a big bank. This isn't "big banks are evil", this is "You are operating an unlicensed MSB, and are far to great of a risk for us to carry an account".

So you mean since December? As far as Doge being "the tipping currency", that is all fun, if you want to tip literally a worthless amount (credit where credit is due, I see the occasional substantial amount of Doge tipped in the main subs about as often as I see any amount of BTC tipped). Ultimately, I see nearly all of the alts as a distraction. Worse yet, they cheapen the importance of Bitcoin. Someone sees 10 Doge being tipped, and they find it funny then move on, because it doesn't do anything. If someone sees even a token amount of BTC tipped, at least their research will show that Bitcoin has real value and can be used on real things. I worry that prolonged exposure to alts will lead people to disappointment, which will drive them away from crypto.

The first thing the police are going to do is ask detail about your mining operation? You could probably try to say you GPU mined it back in the day, but then they are going to ask for wallet info, or mining pool accounts. They are going to ask why you tumbled before you sold. It's not as simple as you are making it. 
You would probably be better off slowly infusing it as capital with an existing business, or using the cash to buy easy to resell items then opening an online store selling them at a very comparable price.

Because retail buyers as a whole make up a small part of the market, even in large forex markets. Even collectively, you are tiny. 
It also doesn't matter where the orders are placed. If they are OTC, or being matched with opposite orders on Coinbase, that still removes those coins from entering the exchanges. It still has an impact on supply and demand, it's just so small that it really doesn't matter (yes, even collectively as a whole).

Yes, because wealthy people frequently buy themselves militaries and set out on conquests. 
If Bitcoin is wildly successful, only a handful of people will be astoundingly wealthy, and it is really no different than people who inherit mass amounts of wealth because someone in their family happened to start a bank or investment firm years back. Or how about the people who create do-nothing Silicon Valley startups that get bought for a few million dollars? People come in and out of wealth every day, and no one has any problems with it. 
Furthermore, only a handful of mentally ill people here believe in any sort of Bitcoin super utopia ever coming to pass, Bitcoin can succeed without being the only currency on the planet, and while not every acts like they understand that, I think very few people don't genuinely understand.

That is the thing, there is **nothing** that could be misinterpreted. Absolutely nothing. Its not like it is a gray area, there is nothing. Paypal is also large enough that they undoubtedly get preferential treatment.

I'm not with Coinbase, but I understand the legal structure behind this, so maybe I can help answer your question. 
If you tell people what the AML policies are, they will structure around them. For instance, if I told you that you could only transfer $1000 per day, and you have $1100 that you needed to move, you might send $550 one day, then $550 another. It isn't necessarily nefarious, you probably just don't want to fill out the form. However, if if it was nefarious, then you might start sending $999 every day to stay below the radar. 
Part of drafting an AML policy is ensuring it is effective. That means being able to properly detect questionable actions, report on them, and ideally stop them (as they are a burden to document, hence why accounts get closed). If you tell someone how to get around them, then your policies are no longer effective, because you can't detect the act. This is actually one of the aspects that Charlie Shrem was accused of in his brush with the law. Perhaps can even chime in, as I'm sure he knows more about this than I do.

Paypal is an easily reversible form of payment, so not many sellers will allow it. Those that do will charge you outrageous rates. You are much better off transferring money to an exchange, such as Bitstamp, and going through the verification process, if your order is very large. If your order is smaller (less than a few thousand dollars) you should register on Coinbase.com or Circle.com and purchase there. Both sites allow standard domestic bank transfers, and will offer market rate or near market rate (within a percentage point).

Each card issuer has different criteria for charge backs. He was unsatisfied with the service before he was even able to utilize it, and correctly asked the company to issue a refund. They refused. Im not suggesting he call and report that the transaction was fraudulent, however, you can still dispute or charge back a transaction for other reasons. If he called and explained that customer service said they would issue a refund in 180 days and he found that unreasonable, most credit card issuers are going to agree, especially since the poker site did say they would issue a refund (it just wouldnt be for an unreasonable time). That still doesnt solve the bigger issue that even if he successfully charges back the transaction, his card will likely be revoked for a TOS violation from the issuer.

Walmart currently (I would assume) pays in direct bank transfers or checks, both of which are virtually free for large companies. If they pressured their suppliers to take bitcoin, their suppliers would want/need to convert part of that, probably at a cost of 1%, which gets passed on to Walmart. In your example, if they started insisting they take Visa, the same thing would happen, processing costs would go up. 
@_date: 2014-01-30 23:56:37
Why would they risk money they need to cover costs? I suspect they would just not convert profits on all bitcoin purchases. The items that vendors let them purchase with bitcoin, they would then use those "profit" bitcoins to pay for at whatever the current exchange rate is. Giant crash? No worries, they still have the dollars to pay their vendors. 
This might leave 1-3% of their total bitcoin sales in bitcoin, and it would still leave them no exposure to loss, it would just open up possible failures to realize the maximum amount of profit. Then again, if Bitcoin rises in value, they would actually profit more than if they have converted it to dollars. 
@_date: 2014-06-10 15:52:07
Those companies can only do that because there is another physical location for them to have a presence in, regardless of how small it is. 
The IRS has been very clear on this in the US, and I suspect it operates very similar elsewhere in the world. When you receive bitcoin, you record that as a payment in the current value. This is no different than if you were paid in gold, or Euros. If you spend bitcoin, that is also a taxable event, if the value has risen, you owe taxes on the difference from when you received it. If you purchased bitcoin, then you spend it, you still owe taxes on the difference. Again, no different than if the value of a hunk of gold changed from the time you bought it. 
The notion that you could simply operate in bitcoin and not pay any taxes is ludicrous, as the IRS has already issued guidance on that. The notion that you could purchase bitcoin and count it as an expense is equally as insane, as their is no item that a business can simply purchase and hold to use at a later, yet deduct it on their taxes. I pray that you do not operate a business or do your own taxes, or else the IRS is going to rip you to fucking shreds.

Even if you believe bitcoin will succeed  **DO NOT INVEST MORE THAN YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE!!!**.

Obviously no one knows. We know how many Bitcoin will be created because it is a **fixed monetary supply**, like I stated earlier. New Bitcoins are still being created, therefore it is still in a period of **inflation**, like I stared earlier. Bitcoin will continue to be inflationary, because new Bitcoins are being created at a rate greater than they are lost. At some point in the *future*, they will be **deflationary** because more will be lost on a day to day basis than new ones that are being created. 
If you still don't understand it, perhaps you should look up the definition of **fixed monetary supply**, **inflationary**, and **deflationary** before you respond.

My assumption would be yes. Paypal's reasoning is either regulatory reasons, or concerns over scams originating in third world countries. 
However, as you just learned, you dont need Paypal to use bitcoin. As long as you can get your customers to pay you in bitcoin, you can use any bitcoin wallet! Your options on spending or converting are undoubtedly limited, but perhaps you can do something to change that. 
Be sure to tell others in your community how you were able to accomplish this. This is a use case for Bitcoin that is actually a big deal and could really change things for the people in your country and similar.

I wish people would remember that down voting isn't a disagree button. You have a very valid point, and it is one I agree with. 
A few months ago, when the price was hovering around $1000, people pushed for mBTC. It made sense, mBTC was about to reach parity with the dollar. Others pushed for uBTC (or bits, as they have now become known) and people rejected that idea. It was to presumptive, it would be annoying for large amounts, etc. Now, the price is half of that, and suddenly uBTC is the way to go? 
uBTC is annoying. If everything was handled in uBTC (thankfully it is not), I would be required to place several "0"s just to define that I am sending 1 BTC. Similarly, my coffee suddenly costs thousands of uBTC, instead of 0.001 BTC or 1 mBTC. How is that more convenient or less confusing?

Most governments have a rule of law, they cant simply declare something illegal without a legislative process, and even if a procedural maneuver allows it, their legislative branch can still create some huge back lash. This kind of war cant be waged in the shadows, it would be quickly exposed. All the while, not all the bitcoins in the world are for sale. Even if they were, not all are mined. Even if mining is somehow disrupted, there are dozens of developed alt coins. 
This is nonsensical paranoia. No, what you described can not simply happen. If it did there would be a huge public outcry. There would be lawsuits. There would Congressional hearings.

Here is why Amazon is not planning on accepting bitcoin in the immediate future (lets try to not get delusional): 
**It’s costly. It’s not that they arent capable, it is simply too expensive.**
Amazon divides programmers into groups. So you are going to have to have a group that takes care of their backend software working on it, a group that maintains the shopping cart function working on it, a group that maintains their accounting software working on it, and a group that maintains their customer service software working on it. 
They are going to have to administrators write procedures and policies for internal management, they are going to have to train select customer service reps and managers on it, same with accounting, same with legal. 
Finally there is the bigger issue. Amazon doesnt really utilize third party services, they tend to keep things in house. They arent simply going to partner with Coinbase or Bitpay, they are going to build their own solution to hedge against exchange rates. This will require even more maintenance and programing time. They will then also need to dedicate a network security team to secure and maintain the security of this portion. 
All of this will cost millions of dollars up front, and on going costs of several hundreds of thousands of dollars per year, if not into the millions. Its very difficult to suggest that they would receive enough business via bitcoin to warrant the investment. 
Now before you start bitching about how they could use Coinbase or Bitpay, they could also use Paypal or Stripe. They could integrate with Google Wallet. They dont. They keep payment processing in house, because it offers the most affordable rates, and it gives them the ultimate control. They are large enough that it is worth the cost of maintaining it in house. They would not use a third party processor for bitcoin. 
Face it, bitcoin would benefit from Amazon accepting it far more than Amazon would benefit from accepting bitcoin. They dont need free advertising. They dont need a gimmick to drum up business or to make them relevant again (looking at you Overstock, I love you!). They would be doing bitcoin a HUGE favor, not the other way around.

I agree entirely. When I said that it would be realistic, I wasnt being specific enough. Its realistic in the sense that it could actually happen, not that it should be an expectation. I personally believe we are beyond exponential growth. Gone are the days where we will 10x returns, unless you are measuring much longer periods. Our growth would still be spectacular, but significantly more sustainable, if we were looking at 1.5x per year. The biggest exception could be after the next halving, as our rate of "inflation" will drop off significantly, and if demand remains the same that should result in a new period of price exploration. Ultimately I think that would just lead to a bubble, and within a couple of months we would be back here having this conversation about how unrealistic it was for people to think that asinine growth was becoming the norm again.

I dont know precise numbers, so I will be using a lot of "X". Bear with me, the theory is still valid even without knowing the precise amounts. 
At any given time, there is X number of bitcoins listed for sale on exchanges. There is also another portion of bitcoins that are not listed on exchanges, but have been moved within a certain amount of time, therefore they are also "in play", because they are sitting in someone's hot wallet, or otherwise are available for trade. Everything else is stale. This is where bitcoin days destroyed comes into play. Once stale addresses start moving, those are suddenly "in play" again. 
While we may determine "market cap" as being the total number of bitcoins mined multiplied by the current price, that is not actually the value of the current market cap, because many of those coins have not moved, or may be lost. The real market cap is the total number of non-stale bitcoins multiplied by the current price. If you suddenly have a large number of bitcoins moving that were previously inactive, that must be considered. New bitcoins havent been created, but more bitcoins are now "in play" for trade or sale on an exchange. 
This is why the bitcoin days destroyed metric is monitored, because it allows us to see when these large amounts of previously stale bitcoins are moving, and this is why the price will sometimes react when days destroyed spikes, at least until we know why it has spiked (often times an exchange will come forward and confirm they moved a cold wallet or something). If Satoshi started moving thousands of ancient coins, the market would have to decide whether that is priced in, or whether the price needs to correct to factor those in. I think enough people consider those coins gone that the market would correct down to price those "new" coins in.

Its unreasonable for customers to think they can short BTC by buying a refrigerator. If there is a return, give them USB back, or the BTC equivalent, and make sure it is spelled out in the return policy. People are getting more and more used to various return policies, for instance a local store that I shop at charges 3% for credit cards. If you make a return, you dont get that 3% back. In fact, if you make a return and decide you want it back on your credit card, you get charged 3% again. 
It might be more difficult for people to adjust to at a major retailer, but if it is spelled out on the receipt, I think it isnt unreasonable.

I think they could argue that since bitcoin is not a credit card, it doesnt violate exclusivity, just like debit cards and cash. Im sure that depends on how the agreement is written, but I would be very surprised if they blocked themselves from accepting ALL other payments.

Sam's Club allows all major credit cards on their website, despite not being able to accept them in store.

Exactly. Putting the license requirement in my ads also thins out the less than serious buyers. 
I have gotten requests from people who don't have the license, and I just ask if they mind doing it at an FFL. In every instance but one, they have been very nice and seemingly well adjusted people who bothered to show up at a meet at an FFL, so I just did the sale. If they couldn't have done the transfer, they probably wouldn't have shown up, so I felt like it satisfied due diligence. That one meet, the guy showed up but he was an obvious newbie from our conversation. When asked if he could pass a background check and would be willing to do one, his response was "I think so, I have never done one before". I got the impression that he genuinely assumed he could, but had not done one, but I didn't feel like I could leave it at that, since there was the faint possibility of "I have a skeleton in the back of my closet, but I might pass one". It all checked out.

I think Bitpay's big news was the Toshiba deal, not that they received some VC funds. The Toshiba will likely have a bigger impact than Dish, but the results wont be seen for a while, because it requires merchants to purchase or update their POS system, get setup with Bitpay, etc.

Lining their pockets is exactly why they should use it. I like when merchants give a discount, it makes it much better to use Bitcoin with, but at the end of the day, not every merchant can/will offer a discount. You can [currently] only purchase Netflix on a month by month basis. If they offered a 2% reward, it would take you almost two years of paying with Bitcoin just to earn one free month. They could just give you a small discount off of the base price, but I think most people are going to look at the prospect of getting $0.14 off as being uninteresting.

Doge rubs me the wrong way. Admit it or not, Doge was designed to be a huge joke. It has died down, but early on a majority of the Doge community was openly mocking bitcoin. I deplore the idea of someone's first exposure being Dogecoin, because that will frame their opinion of all cryptos!

True, but think of what Coinbase did to get Overstock. They dedicated a team and got them up and running extremely quickly. Now, if Coinbase has other similar size merchants in its sights, I think it is reasonable to believe they will be taking a similar approach. That means there are other large merchants that should be expected in the next 4-6 weeks. That is a bit more of a startling revelation, IMO. I was expecting several throughout the year, not several in Q1.

1: It isnt worth nothing. My only card out of six that doesnt charge for international transactions is my American Express card. Bitcoin is gaining in acceptance, but you are right, its not there yet. 
2: Its store of value is relevant as a currency too. Since it is both a currency and a good store of value, it has the potential to be significantly more liquid than gold. If I have a couple of gold bars sitting around, I probably cant pack them up, go to a car dealership, and buy a car. I would have to find a someone to buy it, incur fees, then take the cash and buy the car. I also have to lug a couple pounds in gold around, which isnt any fun. 
3: Sort of. Have you ever had your card stolen? It is a PITA, especially if someone physically steals your card and has it in their possession. I spent upwards of 10 hours back and forth with the bank when my card was stolen, and another 3-4 hours dealing with the police and prosecutor (which was my choice). It shouldnt be like that. It makes absolutely no sense to make fraud prevention/protection reactionary instead of preventative. 
4: The cost for a merchant to go back to fiat is 1% or less. That is an actual savings for merchants, as the typical credit card processing charge is around 2%. The merchant benefits in other ways (no chargebacks!) so they *should* be giving that back to customers. Currently a lot of retailers treat accepting BTC like a novelty, so they dont. I think that will change as things get more competitive. 
5: Chargebacks are an important tool for consumers. Escrow would be a better tool for ensuring your goods or services are satisfactory, but that is cumbersome with fiat. It isnt with bitcoin. 
6: If done right, fraud protection isnt needed with bitcoin. If you follow some simple best practices, no one should be compromising your wallet. If you maintain your savings in cold storage and keep a hot wallet with an easy to remember password, there really should be no way for someone to steal your BTC in the time it takes you to realize your phone is missing. 
Bitcoin isnt perfect. Its young, its somewhat clunky, and there are a lot of things to work out to make it more desirable. That may mean it isnt right for you to use right now. Users right now are early adapters, we are using it because we want it to be successful, and we now have something to gain if it becomes successful. If you dont want to use Bitcoin, thankfully no one will force you to use it. Unfortunately, the same cant be said for fiat. I applaud you for keeping an open mind and actually trying to learn about Bitcoin and why you may or may not use it before deciding it isnt for you. Hopefully someday it will be.

I will be really curious to find out what price these fetch. My gut tells me that a large buyer will purchase all of them. If that is the case will they pay more for them? Obviously if someone wanted to put in a $24M buy order that would have a market impact, and avoiding that should come at a premium. On a similar note, a $24M sell order would have a reverse effect, driving the price down. 
It will be fascinating to see how all of these factors impact a sale this large.

LocalBitcoins locks it when the order is placed, however talk to the seller ahead of time. Some sellers are insistent on recalculating.

Purchasing 3000 coins would chew through the order book of any given exchange, and drive the price up 10%+. We are really talking about 30,000 BTC here too, which is even more substantial. Anyone winning these coins is going to at least have knowledge of how dark pool/of exchange transactions happen. Typically they occur at a price higher than current market price, because they don't want to influence the price. They also usually involve non-disclosure agreements to maintain that level of non-influence. 
Aside from having some uncertainty about where the market might be at the end of the auction, this is really an ideal sale for a buyer. No exchange to deal with, trustworthy seller who will complete their side of the deal with no problems, etc. Again, the people winning these auctions are going to be interested in taking a long term position in BTC, not gambling on whether or not they might be able to dump them in a week.

At this point your objective has already been achieved, you have prevented them from unjustly automatically confiscating your property, thereby forcing it into the courts where you can be given due process. 
If a nation has decided they are going to ban bitcoin, and start confiscating bank accounts, that is a pretty good sign that things are fucked and you need to leave. No government has done that though, and no first world country could just do that on a whim.

Right now it is about 3600 BTC daily, based on the assumed 10/block generation rate. Assuming about 12 million BTC have been mined, that means Bitcoin is inflating an additional 0.0288% every day. While not major, it's not insignificant. At today's exchange rate, that is roughly $2.2 million dollars worth, and it is 1/4th of Bitstamp's total volume. 
I neither agree nor disagree that we may be out of the "investment stage" as you put it, I think it is simply too early to tell. One thing to consider when it comes to the halving, currently even when the price doesn't move either direction, when supply is equal to demand, the total capacity is advancing some $2.2 million. 
When the halving occurs, that supply will be cut short. It will cause some price discovery even before it occurs, as the markets will be attempting to hash out whether or not the newly mined coins make it to market, or whether they are simply hoarded. There will also be a question of mining profitability, and whether those that were mining coins will turn to buying them (unlikely this round) and if the miners are making sufficient income. If the miners are no longer breaking even, they may start hoarding if they were selling.

My wife has worked in this particular mall for years. They will let *anyone* have space there. Here is a short list of the absurd things they have allowed in the past, off of the top of my head:
* Oxygen bar (out of business in 3 months) 
* Teeth whitening kiosk (out of business is 6 months) 
* Numerous Gold to cash businesses
* Eyebrow threading
* A head shop under the guise of an "import store" (closed, reopened under a new name) 
* **A kiosk that sold hermit crabs**
* Chinese imported lotions and cosmetics kiosks 
* Half a dozen independently owned regular ATMs  
Let me put to you this way, this is in the same section as a vending machine and the guy who sells beanbag chairs. As my wife says, if you can pay the kiosk fee, keep your area clean, and not sell inappropriate items, you can maintain a kiosk. 
I'm not suggesting that this isn't a cool thing, it is just naive to think that Simon Malls approves of this anymore than they do a guy selling hermit crabs. It is in a good spot however, right outside Barnes and Noble, in the path of one of the main entrances.

There are a dozen or so states that modeled their concealed carry laws after Florida's. Much of the Voter ID laws follow the same template. Most of the abortion restrictions follow the same template. Several states have very similar medical marijuana laws. Many states have the same "right to work" laws. 
In the US, state assembly people and state governors meet all the time for conventions. Most of them are partisan. The result is laws that are virtually the same because they all came from the same "template", some of these "templates" even having been written by activists for that specific law. Similarly, when States are tackling an issue that is new for them, they will turn to States that already have similar laws for guidance. 
Similar things can happen on an international level, though I don't have specific examples outside of treaties and such that have been ratified by certain UN member states.

I have said it before, and I will say it again. Amazon has no reason to implement bitcoin. In fact, it would likely cost them more money to implement bitcoin than the savings they would generate from the cheaper processing fees. 
They likely will not change their position until it makes sense fiscally, which will be a long time. Amazon is a very large company, and there would be hundreds, if not thousands of people that would need some training or education across multiple departments. That does not come cheap.

Oh, I don't like the idea of "pull" at all, but the question comes up, and I understand why people like it (aside from it being similar to the system they are accustomed to). 
I dont think Company A is like a bank. It could be, but it doesn't need to be. If anything, they are like an escrow company. The coins in this wallet are multisig, they are in a pool that all three parties have access to, but need 2 of 3 consensus to spend. This means that Company A doesn't need to hold funds, nor can they steal funds without corrupting either Subscription or trucking you into authorizing the transaction. This also prevents them from operating a fractional reserve, or otherwise becoming insolvent. 
The fee could be pretty minimal, as it should all be automatic. Basically Company A only serves to verify the identity of the other two parties, and to ensure that the transaction meets the given criteria (below a certain amount, on a certain day, etc). That is why I think this could even be run by your own node, or using an open standard. Perhaps the real cost is in insurance, compensating you if Company A authorizes a transaction that didn't meet your criteria, and Subscription is unwilling to issue a refund. Even that could be handled on a case by case basis. If you have a billing agreement with a merchant that is worth $50, then you might not need insurance against a $500 fraudulent transaction. Similarly, you might pay less for an insurance clause that only kicks in if one criteria is met, IE Company A released payment on the wrong day, in the wrong amount, etc. These are just ideas, I haven't given fees much thought. 
This is really just multisig with some fancy layering. If we break it down to the core, Subscription is creating a multisig transaction and signing with the key they control. On another layer, based either on an open protocol (preferred, obviously) or a proprietary protocol, they are sending proof of their identity (number generator, cryptographic proof, something), details needed to prove the billing agreement is being satisfied, if necessary, information to identify the billing agreement, and maybe something else. Obviously the agreement needs to have terms that can be validated automatically, so things like payment amount, and payment date are okay, but things like "was the service actually performed?" is not. This isn't any different than credit cards though, there is a limit to what can actually be validated. If the service wasn't performed, you tell Company A to break the agreement for this billing period or permanently. 
To address spam, I would go with the same thing that prevents spam on the bitcoin network, a microscopic fee paid to Company A for merely receiving the request. If the agreement is satisfied, the fee is then returned. If the agreement is not found to be valid, then the agreement determines what happens to the fee. Perhaps the node keeps it, or perhaps the agreement dictates that the fee is returned if the issue is later resolved. 
So now that I have that all out of my head, this is really a super fancy 2 of 3 multisig wallet. If created openly, a layer built over the bitcoin portion would allow this to function, and it could function openly. You could run your own verification node, programming your own rules, or you could rely on a central node. A central node could have the benefit of being on Subscription's white list, thereby allowing them to accept your payment with zero confirmations. If it isn't on the list, no big deal. The nodes would need a means to identify themselves, and Subscription needs a means to know which node to interact with. This could probably be done in a decentralized mesh, like bitcoin, but there would be an insane amount of data flying around, so that might not be desired. You also may not want your payment rules synchronized across all nodes. 
This is all jumbled in my head, and I'm on mobile, so rereading it is a pain. If you can't make sense of it, let me know and I will come back on a computer later and better organize my thoughts.

There are a lot of ways to get around this. Third party processors can handle this, offloading some of the risk, a merchant can wait until the transaction has been thoroughly propagated through the network to reduce a race attack risk, the merchant could take ID or use surveillance to deter (and hopefully catch) cheaters, and finally, off chain transactions. A merchant could offer its own wallet that could be funded in advance and you can withdraw your balance from later, or they could use a network that does something like this (Neo, Coinbase, Coinkite, etc). Again, there are probably some service fees here. 
The system isnt perfect, but there is still both time and room for some innovation. This is a problem that will hopefully get solved in a clean manor in the coming year or so.

They used to primarily get their coins from Bitstamp. If you could manipulate the Bitstamp price, the Coinbase price was also effected. This was an active problem in September 2013, where you could essentially set your own price.

All of it? No. 
Should you withdraw ANY of your savings to buy bitcoin? That is a very personal decision. Remember, while we believe in bitcoin, that doesnt guarantee its success. Something could still happen. If you are interested in transferring some of your savings, consider what you have for retirement. Consider what you have set aside for 3/6/12 months of living expenses (take your pick based on your comfort level). That remaining amount is all you should be considering. If it is a substantial amount that can more than cover multiple rainy days (car needs repairs, water heater blows up, etc) then half isnt to crazy. If it is a smaller amount, consider a tiny percent, maybe 5%-15%. Bitcoin is reasonably liquid, but you also have to consider that you wouldnt want to have to cash out all of your bitcoin while it is at a low point because your car broke down on your want to buy a water heater, which broke while you were on vacation and caused $10k in flood damages.

I think it would be more entertaining to watch everyone squirm. I can see it now:
















Aside from the technical aspects (hint, the computing that bitcoin performs is not conducive to other processes) a big problem is how do we determine what "beneficial" computation is performed by a decentralized network that is completely neutral to "good causes". Its not like one person can decide where that power is going to be put, nor can we go through a fork every time it is determined that we need to shift focus.

Cant do that, the government will surely make your forfeit your "illegal" gains. Just about everything in bitcoin is a zero sum game. The *biggest* mistake you can make is to ask questions later. If Shrem had been involved in a bank, he would have gotten a slap on the wrist. You have to expect a similar fate whenever bitcoin is involved. DPR will probably get a mush more harsh sentence than someone facing similar charges for selling drugs on the street. That is just the reality.

Which is why it will be an extremely narrow ruling, and it really must be. The claim that your religious rights are being violated must both be specific (IE you need to be able to reasonably articulate why they are being violated) and have a demonstrated harm. There are instances where the government is allowed to "violate" those rights if it can be determined that what the government is trying to accomplish is equally applied across all classes (not discriminating against a particular religion) and there is no other way of accomplishing it. In the Hobby Lobby case, a decision in Hobby Lobby's favor would apply only to their specific situation, and it would be extremely narrow so as to require other businesses seeking a similar exemption to battle it in the courts and substantiate their claims, which is even a point their lawyer made during oral arguments! Moreover, their claim to seek an exemption is more on behalf of their employees. Hobby Lobby openly admits they could pay the fine, and it would cost less, but that puts their employees at a disadvantage. Other businesses may not be able to make that claim, and again, the court may just say "Tough shit, pay the fine, then pay your employees more". 
In the instance of tax collection, I highly doubt that it would stand that you can practice a religion of capitalism where you don't pay taxes. After all, religious organization are still subject to taxation if they are not operating as a non profit. Finally, there are several reasonably autonomous religions that could make this claim (and I'm sure they have, I just am to lazy to look it up), yet they still pay income taxes. For instance, look at the Amish. While they can be exempted from draft military service, jury service, etc, they still pay federal taxes.

That doesnt really solve anything. If NY decides you are violating the law, they can still issue a summons. Sure, you might be out of the state (better yet, out of the country) but that summons will prevent you from ever going to NY. That might not be a big deal for some people, but for others, it could be huge. It could also have future ramifications, such as being denied entry into the US (or being scooped up while trying to enter another state). 
Its naive to expect businesses to stick their head in the sand and risk jail time. Its naive to suggest that we can ignore powerful regulations by "innovating faster". This is something we need to address.

Let's look to my examples again, explosives and chemical bombs. When the Boston Marathon attack happened, even after they found the guys they were hesitant to go near them for fear that they would continue using explosives. The same thing, but worse, would happen if someone started setting off chemical bombs, since not every police officer carries a gas mask in their car. 
Chemical attacks are pretty much unprecedented in the US, but if/when something like that happens, it will scare people far more than a mass shooter ever could. Mass shooters can be tackled, shot at, etc. It's going to be impossible to stop someone while you are chocking to death.

Definitely correct on that front. He uses Paypal and Square though, and doesn't charge credit card fees to the customer, so that is beneficial for him, since I'm never home to pay. He could also just hold BTC and cash out at our bitcoin ATM, again something he showed interest in.

I'm familiar with the Starbucks app, I use it several times a week. You still have to open your app, click pay, present it to the employee, they have to scan it. The process isn't that much more streamlined. 
What you are describing requires a payment protocol of some sort, whether it is third party or part of the core protocol. There is a payment request protocol implemented in some wallets, but it does not work the way you describe, and it can not work the way you describe. 
A fundamental principal of bitcoin is that transactions have to be signed by the sender. You can not "pull" money from another wallet, nor would you want to. You suggest limits could be put in place, that is fine and dandy, but those limits can't be part of the core protocol, because what it is $10 to me could be a weeks wages to someone in the developing world. So it would have to be set by the wallet. If someone inadvertently set it incorrectly, or it failed in some way, your batista could be stealing thousands of dollars from you. Not cool. 
Now, with a third party solution, you could do this. Say Coinbase builds this. They could have known "safe" clients who on a client to client basis could have a limit on how much they can pull from any transaction. Starbucks might be $10, Red Lobster might be $50. It could then work as you describe, and Coinbase could settle disputes. The only problem is, Coinbase now has added risk of fraud, and they have to protect their customers. To do so, they start charging 3% instead of 1% to process transactions. See where I am going with this? That is a poor system. 
The best way to accomplish what you are describing is from a merchant app itself. You load 1 BTC to your Starbucks wallet, and proceed like normal. If an employee rips you off, the risk is on Starbucks and they can fire the employee. They wouldn't need to charge extra for that, because they can manage the risk internally. However, that isn't innovation, that is just using bitcoin to recharge your gift card balance, which isn't all that exciting.

I disagree on that. We do need awareness. We need people to realize that bitcoin didnt go bankrupt, we need people to know we are still alive and kicking. We also need to reach people who may not have heard about us on the news or in the newspaper. I actually thought the Dogecoin car was brilliant, because that is a demographic that tends to be more blue collar, and blue collar tends to be less in tune with with some of the news sources were bitcoin is frequently covered. Overall, we need some positive exposure to help balance the negative exposure we have received in the past few months.

Good for you. I'm still subscribed here for shits and giggles, but I'm completely out. There comes a time where the money means more. I started selling a little. Then a little more. Then all but a handful. Then all but one. I have great expectations for the blockchain and bitcoin as a network, but all of the infighting the last year or so, and the drama years before that, I don't see bitcoin as a currency ever "making it". At least not in the sense I once thought it might, or hoped it could be. Eventually I realized I was holding onto a very expensive token of digital nostalgia, and even with the remote possibility of a moonshot it made it seem like a very pricey memory.

So on one hand, I don't think I should be worried, because the IRS does not have much to gain by pursuing me.

You don't fuck with the IRS, and even though I am a tax payer in good standing, I don't want them crawling up my ass for any reason.

1) The fiat side of this is already regulated, and most agree that those regulations apply to bitcoin. This would likely be clarified though.
2) If you provide goods or services as payment to an employee, that is still taxable and should be reported. This may not be clarified through regulation, but the IRS will surely make themselves known if it becomes a problem. 
3) Yes.
4) Again, these exist whether the loan is made in dollars, Euros, or BTC. If they arent followed, it means problems for the lender
5) As lame as this is, I think this is very likely, and potentially the most damaging to development and start ups.

I sell on LocalBitcoins, so Im a little biased when I say that it is the best place to buy Bitcoins with Western Union or MoneyGram. The site is having some issues right now, but it should be back shortly. 
If you have any questions about the process, Im more than happy to help, even if you arent buying from me! Just reply to this post or send me a PM. 
Edit: There arent a whole lot of people that sell with MoneyGram on LocalBitcoins, so sometimes the price gets a little high. If it seems unreasonable, wait to see if anyone posts an ad. LocalBitcoins allows sellers to temporarily remove ads (I use this when I go to bed) and they automatically take ads down if you dont have enough in your account to cover escrow, so ads go up and down periodically through the day.

Because Bitcoins aren't a payment system, they are a currency that happens to have a payment mechanism built in. We may see services that create a seamless off Blockchain escrow system where a seller fronts a small security deposit in exchange for access to some or all of the escrowed funds, but these must be separate from the base bitcoin functionality to preserve the base flexibility of bitcoins as well as the free nature (in both cost and regulations) of bitcoins. Ultimately if that sounds like a nice service, someone will create it. Just remember, nothing is free, and a service like that is going to be loaded with fees and fine print, just like our existing banking system.

LocalBitcoins holds the BTC into escrow, you make the payment using the agreed upon method (bank deposit, Western Union, Moneygram, etc), mark the payment complete and send the payment info per the sellers instruction. The seller collects the payment, and releases the escrow to you. 
As long as you communicate well, its pretty painless. 
BitQuick is also a good service from a sellers perspective, as that is all I have done.

The Bitcoin black market economy is even more circular than the regular bitcoin economy. Contraband buyers buy bitcoins, trade them for contraband, those bitcoins are converted to cash, sold back to contraband buyers, rinse and repeat. These coins were going to be converted into cash regardless. This might actually slow that process, since this guy is going to need to disappear like a ghost before he even thinks about cashing out. If he is dumb about it, he might even turn up dead with the private key remaining unknown. (Though its more likely to be tortured out of him)

There is no reason that both couldnt be an option though. Even if you over pay, say you are stuck at an appointment longer than expected.

Bitcoin isnt supposed to level the wealth gap. Wealthy people are wealthy, and the only way you can eliminate that is by redistributing the wealth in some way, certainly something that governments may try to do, and certainly something that Bitcoin, or any free currency, should NOT do. 
Bitcoin does help the economically disadvantaged though. Inflation often benefits those who have, not those who dont have. Take TARP for example. The banks won massive amounts of cash to keep themselves afloat, while ordinary people received nothing. No big deal, they needed to survive, right? Well actually, it is a big deal. The billions of dollars that the banks received subsequently made the dollar worth a tiny bit less for the rest of us. So the banks benefited, tax payers were put on the hook (through government debt), and ANYONE who uses the US dollar lost. 
While bailouts could certainly happen in a Bitcoin dominated economy, the bailouts couldnt be paid for through inflation. In other words, just because some government spends a massive amount of money, or your buying power is not reduced. Your percentage of bitcoins remains the same. If you have 1 BTC, then you still have 1/1,000,000 of all bitcoins that will ever exist. 
There are other properties that makes bitcoin more favorable for those who have less. For instance, for someone with $1,000,000 it is no big deal to wire money back to family in his home country. It might cost him $35 to do so, but that is such a small percentage of his overall wealth, no big deal. He wont miss that $35, and he will still send the same amount of money back home. However, if someone who has say $500 wants to wire money to the same country, that $35 is a HUGE chunk of money, proportionately. However, utilizing Bitcoin's more efficient network, he can complete that transaction for a much smaller sum, and potentially save that extra $34 or pass it along to his recipient. 
Ultimately, bitcoin provides a more level playing field. No need for banks who will always play favorites with those who give them the most. No need to pay a third party large fees to manage your money. No government or central authority who can decide at whim that you should have LESS value than you already have. No financial blockades preventing people from being able to send money to otherwise restricted countries. No ability for a government to decide you cant send money to a political dissident, fugitive, or blacklisted individual. 
Bitcoin promotes freedom and a truly free and neutral market. No bias, no nepotism, no intrusions.

Do not under any circumstance take reversible payment! At least not until it as cleared, can not be reversed, and you empty that account. Of the 100 or so buyers I work with per month, about 5-7 try to commit some sort of fraud. Explain to the buyer what you are doing, why you are doing it, and if they object, ask them to cancel the transaction. If you have reservations about a transaction, explain them and ask them to cancel. If they don't, or if they stop responding, contact support.

These are shots across the bow, play by our rules, or you arent allowed to play at all. 
If we play by their rules, we have no problems (Coinbase, CampBX, Bitstamp) but if we don't play by their rules, they will harass us until we can't play any longer (Mt Gox). 
This is the beginning of a larger struggle, but it is not a backlash. This is the powers that be trying to remind us that they are still in power. At least for now. So fine, we play by their rules, we sit back and we gain momentum. Someday, and it will be soon, we won't have to play by their rules, because they won't be able to hurt us. Then, a short time after that, they will have to play by our rules, because those will be the rules everyone wants to play by, and they will know they will get left in the dust if they don't adapt. 
Bonus twist, they will act like they invented the new rules, and the power struggle will continue. We can will innovate and rewrite the rules, and they will continue to plagiarize them like an over privileged child cheating on their most basic of homework assignments. Someday though, they will slip up and the world will see the truth.

They already allow you to cancel on the non instant transactions. You only get five minutes to cancel, but that is more than adequate for stupid mistakes. A prime example would be if you thought you had switched the app to "Sell" but were still in "Buy". Right or wrong, I click through those pop ups pretty carelessly. If you are dealing with several BTC, this is an expensive mistake, and one that may not be easily correctable.

I sincerely hope you don't think that is the purpose of banks. That may have been their purpose 100 years ago, but now they are lending and investment institutions, where security is a byproduct of those functions. 
You dont need any sort of Bitcoin bank. Someone might chose a hosted wallet, or might chose to pay a service that offers insurance in addition to the security they provide, but they certainly don't have to. 
Bitcoin wallets can be secured through regular computer security practices. If someone wants additional security without surrendering themselves to a third party, they can use a physical device, similar to the Trezor. Ultimately Bitcoin offers the user choice without giving up functionality.

Zero confirmations is low risk for small amounts. A single confirmation is fine for most medium size amounts, additional confirmations as it gets higher. My personal opinion is as follows:
* 0 Confirmations for under $100
* 1 Confirmation for Under $500
* 3 Confirmations for Under $1500
* 6 Confirmations for All Others
The amounts really dont matter, you just have to be comfortable with the risk you are exposing yourself to. In reality, it is very unlikely someone will successfully double spend.

Im still saying, why wait on a single confirmation? Especially for a small transaction. It can be just as quick as running a credit card or counting cash if you dont wait on confirmations.

People say it isn't terribly fast, but in a way, I have to disagree. If clients are broadcasting quickly, and you don't care about confirmations (and you really shouldn't on in person sized transactions) then it isn't bad at all. When I sell someone $100 in BTC, they see the transaction just as quick, if not more quickly, than I can look at the money and see that there are 5 $20 bills. Amplify that by being an obscure amount like $7.xx for fast food. Similarly, it would be much quicker to wait for a confirmation or two than it would be to count $25,000 in cash for someone buying a car or something similar.

I'm not going to try to defend that number to hard, because admittedly, it isn't my number. However, we do know that Bitpay exceeded SR in payments back in April, and has continued building steam, meanwhile Coinbase has added some vendors. Then there are sites like Coingig, Bitmit, and numerous others. I can't defend 4%, because I dont know where it was derived, but it feels closer to the actual number than 20% is. If I personally had to estimate it, I would have *guessed* 10%, with no basis to back that up.

It would be possible to move $30k on LocalBitcoins, but you should still pay taxes on it. Audits are a bitch, and back taxes and fees would be significant.

No, it had more to do with how Coinbase pulled the prices through the API. Eventually those sales would get reported in the API stream, and Coinbase would select an order at random to base the price on. if it selected one of these, it would adjust the price an incredible amount. When it refreshed a moment later, it would pull a more recent order, which would be the correct market price, and cause the price to go back to where it stared.

Whoa! Slow down there. Coinbase is not a big company, they are 6-7 guys. They are doing extraordinary work, but they have had problems in the past, and they will undoubtedly have problems in the future. 
I'm a big fan of Coinbase, but do not keep a large amount of coins there. Print some paper wallets (you can even do it from Coinbase!) or use an Electrum seed, written down and stored somewhere safe.

Do not use the transaction service for online sales. If you do, make sure the seller turns on escrow before you send payment. If I have my customer start out in the transaction service (for times when I dont want to turn on a regular ad and risk taking additional orders that I dont have time to process) I let them know that is what I am doing, tell them not to send payment until I tell them that escrow is on, and then tell them to verify that they can see escrow is on. 
The transaction service offers ZERO buyer protection.

It still doesn't make sense. If you want to turn $2500 into BTC, you should buy BTC. Why would you buy $2500 in hardware, mine for six months, then finally have $2500 in BTC because the value increased? The value would have increased if you bought the BTC to start, and you would have more of it. 
I recommend people look at their mining investments like this: Convert the amount you will spend in hardware to BTC, then figure your ROI in BTC. Dont count on BTC being stronger than USD to get your ROI, because if that is the case, you would have done better buying and holding BTC.

LocalBitcoins, if they have some traction there. If not, most of the large exchanges do business anywhere a SWIFT transfer can be made. 
The biggest issue is just to get people to try it. If a small group in every country is using it, that is inventive to build up services around it. As more services are available and it becomes easier to use, more people will use it. If this one guy can make it work for himself, maybe he will tell a friend, or his family will tell people. From there, they can figure out what the best way to use it, or if none exists, maybe they will build their own solution, or find someone who will build a solution to cater to them.

I suspect you are correct. This is a problem that plagues most of the bitcoin economy though. For instance, I sell bitcoin tshirts. Someone acquires bitcoins, buys a tshirt from me, I take those coins and sell them, then take the USD to buy more tshirts and screen printing ink. Then the cycle repeats. There is no closed loop. There is no distributor (currently) that I can go to and buy shirts and ink from, and if there was, there is no guarantee that the manufacturer the distributor is buying from is buying the materials needed and paying laborers in BTC. Ultimately it makes the transition back and forth between fiat. 
Back to the SR scenario, it should theoretically be fairly neutral, if you assume that all of the coin being used to buy the product is then being cashed out. That is a big if, because you cant assume that. DPR was holding coins, and Im sure vendors were holding coins. That pretty much ensures that SR was creating more demand for bitcoins than the supply they were pushing back into the market. I think the reason we aren’t, and wont, see a major hit has to do with the fact that SR was only 4% of the transactions, then only a fraction of that was being held. If 10% of that was held, and the rest was being sold, then once you remove the supply/demand that was balancing itself out, we are only losing the benefit of those 0.4% that were being held.

Coinbase really isnt an exchange, they are more of a retail store. Exchanges require you to have a balance, and they take the amount of the purchase from your balance. Coinbase doesnt require a balance, but requires payment to clear before they give you your bitcoins. If you do all of the verification and add a credit card, you can enable instant purchases.

I agree with your position entirely. I have a similar pledge that I made to my wife: If the value of half of my bitcoins ever exceeds the balance on our mortgage, plus the taxes due to cash that amount out, I do it immediately. This is kind of cool, because the balance of the mortgage goes down, and the amount of bitcoins I have bought as well as their value goes up! Eventually their paths will cross. Bitcoins will hopefully be around forever, but there are no guarantees. Paying off a major loan however is a sure thing. You have extra monthly income to save or reinvest, and no matter what happens, you no longer have that obligation. It is a very, very good thing.

You love that interest you earn quite a bit, don't you? You shouldn't.

You don't think that the ability to use the currency of your choosing constitutes freedom of expression? How could the government, who has recognized Bitcoins as money in a previous court case, possibly suggest that they can ban a currency? Could they ban Euros? 
As for accounting and taxes, why would they care? Again, I can take a wad of Euros and buy something from a merchant that will take them, they account for the USD value equivalent. No different. 
For the US to ban Bitcoins, they would have to state that they reserve the right to ban any currency at any time. That would have a spectacular amount of blowback.

Look around for any potential online wallets. If there are exchange accounts (CampBX, Coinbase, Bitstamp, Mt Gox) and he thoroughly verified his identity, you might be able to have an estate attorney compel them to release the contained investments to you. In any case, I would see if you can find someone trustworthy to help you. You could potentially be dealing with a large (or very tiny) amount of value. If he had mining equipment, there may be a substantial amount of value SOMEWHERE. Finding it will be the tricky part. Also, the mining equipment has value as well. 
Lastly, even if you have someone help you, stay involved. It sounds like this was something he enjoyed and had interest in. Even if you cant recover the value (aside from the mining equipment, which can be sold), you might want to look into getting a couple bitcoins for yourself as a way to remember him. He was clearly very involved, and it sounds like he may have been a "true believer" of what bitcoin could be, Im sure he will be smiling down on you if you take even a small interest in it :)

I was strategizing with a couple traders immediately after the news broke, only one of the three of us decided to sell, he did very well shorting. I ultimately pulled money from anywhere I could find it, I drained all of my "hobby" money, canceled buy orders I put in earlier in the day, and even took a couple hundred out of my checking account (better to ask for forgiveness...) It worked out very well for me. I got in around $90, and was able to sell the 4 BTC I was able to purchase instantly for about $118. Im just now having the remainder of the cheap BTC post, and it brings a smile to my face to look at the transaction and see that they were purchased for less than $100/BTC.

How does that even make sense? In the traditional exchange, it offers even more of an opportunity for money laundering. Take money, buy coins, transfer coins to different account, sell, clean money comes out. OTC is the same process, but with more caveats, since it would require an actual second person to be involved for any real transaction documentation to be generated (IE sending and receiving transaction receipts for MoneyGram, keeping with my earlier example). Furthermore, if the third party transmission services (Moneygram, LocalBitcoins) are doing their job under the law, then all of the same documentation should be collected. 
What I am basically getting at is OTC is the same as a regular exchange for the buyers and sellers, and it should be on the exchange to be registered. I know the government doesn't see it like that, but that is simply because they want to make it more difficult than it needs to be.

This really has more to do with the transaction type than the transaction fee. Small transactions send from multiple addresses (likely the case here) will require a larger fee to get included in the Blockchain (think of it as the master ledger) because they are disregarded as unimportant and low priority transactions. However, if they have a larger fee, they will get included so that they miner can claim the larger fee. 
Bitcoin transactions can typically be sent for around 0.001 BTC if done in an efficient manor. This is relatively insignificant for a larger transaction. 
Lastly, you might try if you want to acquire some bitcoins in your spare time. Just remember, you spent that time for $0.06. While fun and novel at first, would you really do that if someone gave you six pennies?

Coinbase was pretty professional about the whole thing, first bug wasnt bounty worthy, second one was. I was pretty happy with how it was handled, and even though I received the minimum payout, the bug involved price manipulation and they allowed me to keep several thousand dollars worth of coins that were purchased well below market. All in all, good experience. 
As for Blockchain, keep trying and do the right thing. Hopefully this will raise enough visibility to get it fixed.

No, that is another weird thing. You set a fixed price. I usually just check out the price every day, make sure mine is the lowest or the same price as the lowest.

I love Coinbase, I just have no idea how to integrate it with a traditional shopping card. I need to be able to accept payments in fiat, and I dont want to have customers needing to use two separate carts.

Does anyone know of a shopping card or ecommerce platform that can work with both Coinbase and fiat transactions?

Safe transaction: Meet inside a cafe or restaurant. Buyer puts cash on table, seller checks bills with counterfeit detecting marker and counts bills. Seller leaves cash on table. Seller releases coins, buyer confirms release, seller grabs cash. If at any point either party feels uncomfortable, they can end the transaction.
No one is going to murder you in the middle of a restaurant over a few hundred/few thousand dollars, they would be better off murdering the cashier and taking the money from the register. 
This is how I do meets. I do also carry a firearm, but that has more to do with the fact that I ALWAYS carry a firearm, not so much that I am meeting someone new.

They paid 5 BTC. I agree, they should have probably paid out more, because I could have made a very substantial amount of money, but Im not complaining about 5 BTC, and I did get the keep the BTC I was able to purchase at the manipulated prices.

Could someone possibly use nlock time to send to a designated wallet on a given date (say, 1 week) then when that time came, you could do another nlock time to send to another wallet, repeat. This would keep it in a perpetual state, and basically lock where the coins could go.

Interesting turn of events, no, I did indeed manage to purchase 56 BTC and transfer them out of my account. The outbound transfer did eventually broadcast, and I redid the math a couple times.

Paid a server hosting bill, bought a domain, bought honey caramels from BeesBros, had some graphics files made, gave some spending money to my wife which she used to buy cards on Gyft, paid my portion of the family cellphone bill to my mom (not sure, she may have converted to fiat via Coinbase).

Their Dwolla integration is always giving me headaches. I know that CoinMKT does Dwolla, but their order book is thin, and they charge a small percent to withdraw, so dont deposit in there unless you plan to actually buy coins. I did that, and after I couldnt get an order filled remotely close to CampBX price within 6 hours, I tried to withdraw and lost money on it. 
As for CampBX, be patient and make a lot of noise. Their Dwolla issues work themselves out eventually, but it is a pain waiting on it. I would try posting on their Facebook page as well as their support system to raise the profile of your problem a bit.

I am, sort of. My ultimate goal is keep investing and holding until there is no need to use fiat, and I can live off of my holdings. However, I have already decided that no matter what the amount or how the future looks, if half of my holdings can EVER pay off my house (plus taxes for cashing out) then I will liquidate that half. This is interesting, because it will verge at some point regardless of the value. Im always investing more fiat, and Bitcoins are going up in value. All the while, I am paying more money on my mortgage, so that number is going down. Currently Bitcoins would have to be worth $7500 each for me to do that, but that number is going to gradually go down down down!
If 1/2 of my BTC = value of mortgage + taxes, I cash that out

Just one confirmation, additional are really only necessary for larger amounts. Once you get your first confirmation, all subsequent blocks will contain that transaction, so the additional confirmations come every ~10 minutes. Now if you are sending to a service, they may require extra confirmations before they credit your account.

On both sites there is an escrow. On Bitquick, the seller has no control over the escrow, Bitquick releases the escrow once proof of payment is sent in. On LocalBitcoins, the seller has two options, release the escrow or (24 hours later) start a dispute. The LocalBitcoins staff will review the case, request additional info if needed, then release the escrow or return the coins to the seller.

It does in the sense that if they can selectively throw out blocks at a rate they control, they can already be mining on the next block for a minute or two when the other nodes are just finding out that a block has been solved.

The article presents some good points, and for the most part I agree that miners have little interest in destroying the network, however I think there is a better argument against the 25% attack. 
The notion that the value of BTC will change doesn't even need to be present, because as soon as a pool owner was ousted as corrupt, they would lose workers, thus losing hashing power, and the fees that come with it. The extra profitability would be so minimal that there is no way this could even tempt someone, should they think it all the way through. 
Furthermore, I think capping hash percentages is just awful policy, and I would be very against it being implemented (and how would it be enforced?) If you want to mine to secure the network, do so in a small pool or using P2Pool.

I think difficulty increase will only play a factor in pricing if we reached a point where miners were holding coins (instead of dumping them) because they were not recovering enough to cover electricity and other overheads. That shouldnt be a factor right now though, because ASICs are so energy efficient, and their is a constant arms race, forcing them to buy more equipment. At this point I would question whether a significant amount of coins are being sold by the mining companies, as opposed to being spent or hoarded.

Contrary to popular belief, Coinbase to Coinbase transactions are not always done off blockchain, they largely reserve that for small amounts. 
You are describing a system of fractional reserve, and suggesting that Coinbase would commit criminal fraud on some notion of conspiracy. 
[Edit, because my phone prematurely posted]
And yes, I do believe that creating a fractional reserve system within Bitcoin would be considered fraud, since it is implicit that this is not possible, and one would need to "counterfeit" balances in order to do so. I believe this would be considered a criminal offense in the US, but hope we never have to find out.

The fundamental problem with that is non-preordered miners will not be profitable, at least not reasonably so. If a company has units on hand that are showing to be profitable, they arent going to sell them, they are going to mine with them. If they sell you a preorder, it is only because they want to develop product, but they dont want to be exposed to the risk that they wont make ROI on the hardware they put R&amp;D into. So, they decide to sell hardware rather than mine with it, because other people will likely be willing to accept the risks that the hardware will be irrelevant.

You still need to do ID verify. I suspect the larger issue was people who verified but didnt care. Charge 50 BTC and run. I still maintain that a third ID level could prevent this by running credit reports and offering a "legal" line of credit that would then have straightforward processes for collecting from customers that dont pay. The amount of exposure could also be controlled by the amount of risk the customer presents. 
@_date: 2013-07-21 08:11:53
I dont think they are manually approving, that would be insane! I would assume that they try to que up transactions, and sometimes the que gets backed up. I have noticed that when I try to make large transactions, they go much faster. Also, Coinbase pays mining fees, but they dont specify how much they pay. If they are including a minimal fee, then it is possible that is causing further delay once it finally leaves the que. I guess I will have to look over a few transactions of varying sizes and determine how much they are including. 
I do also know that when I use the "buy instantly", then transfer that payment, it takes longer than if I simply bought the coins, waited a few hours, then tried to transfer it. They arent doing the bank draw at that time (they do it at the end of the day) but Im guessing there is an extra step in there that adds time.

I dont know that I would say it is acceptable, but I also think it doesnt matter. Not everyone can be a winner, that is just the nature of a free market. It is true with dollars, it is true with Euros, it is true with Yaun, it is true with Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin offers nothing to the impoverished directly.

Overestimate. A lot of people didnt think we were going to see the difficulty hit 100 million before November. They were very wrong, and if they cut it close, very screwed. 
There is little, if any, mining to be made by small miners now. Thats not to say you shouldnt mine, but you should do so knowing that you will likely make little to no profit, and be okay with that. If you are doing it to secure the network, more power to you. If you are doing it to get rich, you are going to be very disappointed.

Use and confidence. Until there are more mainstream places to spend BTC (we need Amazon, Paypal/eBay, Overstock, and maybe some physical chain stores), people have no reason to use them other than a store of wealth, which leads us to confidence. 
Long term, bitcoin is probably better than a store of wealth, because it's potential hasnt been reached, so it is increasing at an abnormal rate (even in the days after a crash!). However, people are hesitant because they do see the volatility and wonder "Will it be low when I need?" or "Could it possibly go away?" or "What if it gets stolen/I lose it/etc". 
We need both. We need people to see that even through the ups and downs, it is all okay in the end. We also need them to see that if they need something, they should be able to buy it with the BTC that their wealth is stored in. If my parents have 1 BTC (close, I know they spent some recently :) ) then they should be able to buy a dishwasher when theirs breaks, and they shoudnt have to convert to fiat to do so. If they dont need to use it on silly things beforehand, they should be able to use it to buy groceries when they retire. 
The best part is we are almost there. I genuinely believe that 2014 will be the year of the large merchant (and India, topic for a different thread). Once that happens, I think we will be able to get a lot of people on board. 
People need to be able to spend BTC on the things they need, and they need to be educated that through the ups and downs, it is ultimately up.

This is one of the few markets that is unlikely to be influenced by the SR, and it could provide some major stability while the rest of the world, especially the US market, rebounds from the news. Its hard to deny that in some markets SR was a large part, if not the majority, of the economy. The Chinese are into BTC with little SR influence, which means their confidence will not be shaken by news of the closure (but perhaps by the rapid decline in the rest of the world)

I would probably just get verified at Bitstamp and do the same thing. You would cash out for a higher value and save on fees, plus a weekly wire of $300k is going to look a lot less odd than a daily ACH of $50k. Regardless, I would shop banks around ahead of time and make sure they know the money is coming and where it is originating (telling them it is from a European bank, or a California based company).

The big difference is that when governments print more, they are doing so with some claim of needing to pay bills, stimulate the economy, wage war, etc. If someone where to say "Lets make more bitcoins!" The rest of the network should react like this "WTF? No! If I dont mine these, then everything I have is less! I gain nothing!". We also know that we have the power to stop it. If the US government states that they are going to make more dollars, we may not like it, but we cant really stop it. Even if 50% of the miners said they were going to do this, we (the users and unswayed miners) could hard fork and exclude them.

Uhm, yeah it does? I mean, you have to get verified, but whether you realize it or not, you did the same thing when you opened your trading account.

I think they underestimate Bitcoins and don't feel very threatened by them. If they did, they wouldn't be engaged in a dialog, their reaction would be swift and unpredictable.

About half of my customers are newly registered users that I like to refer to as Bitinstant refuges. Just like any refuge, they will return to their home when all becomes normal again.

There isnt really risk, because they are purchasing the coins with the knowledge that they are pulling that money out of your account. They arent waiting a week to get your money, then purchasing the coins.

With small transactions as long as the transaction broadcasts, the seller is at very little risk. If something happens and the transaction isnt confirmed, we are talking about less than $10. The merchant could also insist that a mining fee is paid to ensure that it will be confirmed. 
This is a common thing that I just dont understand. Sure, wait for confirmations on larger amounts of money (and by that, I mean define how much you think a larger amount is) but outside of that, make sure it has broadcast and count on the fact that it makes no sense to double spend on $10.

Traditionally Coinbase's price has been Bitstamp + 1% + $0.15. However, there was a time when they followed the Mt Gox price, and they have always stated that they buy coins from all of the major exchanges. 
My theory is that they are currently buying coins from their Mt Gox account to clear it out (since the price spread is much smaller now), so the prices are a little high so they minimize loss. My alternate theory is that they have simply changed the pricing structure slightly to recoup some of the losses they sustained from abuse of the Instant purchase feature. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 22:24:55
No, a law can't. There would be a First Amendment argument against it, and they would have to argue that they can ban any foreign currency, since the courts have recognized Bitcoins as money.

The specific lender will tell you what they need. You can probably provide a printout of the transaction confirmation(s) from your exchange.

Micropayments are someplace Bitcoin shines, yet we haven't really seen this done yet. I would love to pay 0.1 BTC or something and not see an ad on my favorite site for a month.

I know there is a lot of money on the line, but it frustrates me to no end that people accuse Coinbase of trying to rip them off before they even ask them to honor the original price. This happens frequently, and I can't recall a situation where someone asked them to honor the original price and they refused. Stay calm, be nice, and they will hold up their end. 
Oh, and they don't lose money by honoring the original price. They likely pair the order off at the time of execution, so they have already bought the coins at the lower price.

Late to the party, but better late than never. 
P2P exchanges shouldnt be money service businesses, but under the current guidelines, they are. If an intermediary is being used to match buyers and sellers and transfer the bitcoin via an escrow service, that central site should be the money services business. This blocks those who simply have bitcoins or want bitcoins to register, which isnt practical for the occasional buyer or seller. 
@_date: 2013-09-04 15:23:06
Dont use Mt Gox, it is nearly impossible to get money out of there. Coinbase really is the best option if you are just buying and selling here or there. If you will be dealing with larger amounts, you might consider CampBX. CampBX is a US based exchange with a low fee (0.55%). I use it in conjunction with Coinbase. 
If you are interested, here is a referral link, which gives both of us a discount on trades at CampBX.

Precisely what I was thinking. And they could still require the bank draw immediately after, but the "loan" would be until it cleared. If it doesnt clear, it incurs a late fee, interest, and they come after you. A credit check would also allow them to filter out people who dont have much money from gaining access to 50 BTC instant. I mean, if someone doesnt make but $10k a year, then they shouldnt have access to $5k in Bitcoins all at once.

I cant believe you are getting down voted for this. DPR may have been very idealistic in public, but he was clearly not clean behind the scenes. The fact that he took such an "interest" in the affairs of the site, rather than simply providing a place for people to do business, taints his image of a puritan who simply wanted to provide people with a safe place to do as they choose.

There is an intentional delay in the order book, and the way I understand it is Coinbase actually selected orders at random. I would start placing sell orders on Bitstamp, usually starting with about $15 worth, and I would just sell, use the cash to buy back, repeat. I would do that for 20 minutes or so, or until my buy order on Coinbase executed at the target price. If it didnt happen within 20 minutes, I would sit and wait. Usually in the next 10 minutes it would execute. There was only one instance where it didnt ever execute, and Im assuming I just didnt place enough orders for it to carry through.

So that buyers and sellers can donate to the "advertising" fund. How you would chose to spend that would be up to you guys, if you wanted to make a large public donation to a charity, that would be great. You could also use it to run ads on other sites, or offer promotions like smaller transaction fees for a day or something. Just stuff to attract more volume. 
Im consistently selling 1-3 BTC or so with you daily, but there are still times I can have the lowest price in the order book and not get an order for HOURS. The only explanation for that is you just dont have enough people looking at the site.

It will take more than 3 weeks to withdraw from Mt Gox. You also have to consider missed opportunity. That spread isn't as large (percentage wise) as it used to be, the price could change dramatically in the time you are waiting to withdraw BTC. This would result a situation where it would have been more profitable to simply hold Bitcoin than it would have been to try to do the arbitrage. 
And I want to reiterate, people have been waiting more than six months to withdraw dollars from Mt Gox. If you are going to attempt arbitrage, do so with that in mind.

@_date: 2013-12-05 02:46:16
You probably could. The software could use QT to generate the needed addresses, pass them off to an exchange address where they are automatically sold. Obviously the logic would need to be built in order observe the order books and determine the prices, and I'm not sure the capability is there in the APIs for the exchanges to do it. If it is all there, I don't know why you couldn't do it, it would just take a ton of work. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 19:40:43
The point is they track the movement of the coins, so if you send it to a fresh address, your fresh address is now tainted. 
If everyone uses a fresh address for every transaction, then there is no opportunity for them to tag the coins.

@_date: 2013-09-20 20:19:03
Yes and no. Those services will definitely exist. They wont be 100% necessary though. Doing business with someone local to you? Dont bother paying the extra fees. Buying something small where you dont necessarily need buyer protection, but would still like to ensure you receive the item? Escrow. Buying something that might break or be of questionable quality? Use a service that charges more, but offers buyer protection. 
It gives you a lot more choice, as opposed to being locked into using a handful of services at the same price.

Scaremongering. FinCEN has made no indication that they wish to "attack" bitcoin, Congress has made no indication that they wish to "attack" bitcoin. There is no evidence that the large amount of BTC transferred belonged to anyone in any government. 
@_date: 2013-10-28 18:34:40
Yeah, when that happens you just say "Okay". Basically it is warning you that you are pushing a transaction that does not match the private key that it defaults to on Brainwallet, the idea being that you would build a transaction using whatever private key you entered. In this case, since you are not using that key, you just want to click through and it will push it. If Blockchain has already detected that transaction, it will give you an error saying that the transaction already exists. That just means that Coinbase has already broadcast it.

And you have to open a separate support ticket to dispute a transaction that isn't 24 hours old, and it usually takes 48+ hours to resolve, all the while the site potentially has thousands of dollars tied in escrow. It's stressful for sellers. Oh, and if you pair an order off on an exchange you are either going to be really lucky or really screwed over in these fantastic times of insane volatility.

Sounds awesome! I have always wanted to learn to fly, maybe someday an instructor near me will take BTC and I can sneak it right past the wife :) Quick suggestion, get setup on Coinbase or Bitpay. Both will charge you just 1% to process straight to fiat, and Coinbase will process the first $1M for free! This would keep you from having to markup pricing for bitcoin payments. We can all convert to fiat, and we can all do it for much less than 10%, so it makes it pretty unattractive to pay more just to use our preferred payment method.

They have a great relationship with their customers, and you may be able to get them to change their policy regarding this, if they understand a little more about it. I have done this before with insurance related issues, and was very pleased with the individual attention I received, and even though they didnt resolve in my favor, they took the time to look at it from my perspective and evaluate whether or not their original decision was correct once they added in my perspective. 
Let me know if you have any questions. I dont bank with them, otherwise I would have already tackled this issue before. Someone else experienced a similar problem with Bitstamp, but to my knowledge never followed through.

There are a lot of options to chose from. For the most volume, Mt Gox is going to be best, but you may have issues getting money in/out. If you want something based in the US, CampBX will be best. If you sign up with this referral link, you will get a small discount on commission fees. CampBX does not have massive amounts of volume, so things move a little more slowly.

People shouldnt have to worry about whether they are accepting tainted coins or not. So say I am selling something in the classifieds. I carelessly dont check to see if the coins Im accepting are tainted. Now, I try to spend those coins with Acme Big Business, who does check to see if they are tainted. They are. Now I cant spend those coins. So the next time I sell something on the classifieds, I wise up. I use a third party payment system to check and see if the coins are tainted, and they take 1% for their services. 
If checking for tainted coins becomes a thing, it makes it nigh impossible to use them without layered services, because you would never know if the coins you are accepting are tainted. Now there is a single point of failure, and the government can put pressure on these companies to mark coins tainted for any reason. All of a sudden, they can mark coins that were sent to Wikileaks as tainted. They can mark coins that were sent to Snowden as tainted. They can mark coins that were once spent in Cuba, Iran, or North Korea as tainted. Under investigation? Now your bank accounts are frozen, and all known bitcoin addresses have been marked as tainted. Basically we end up with the same system we already have, sans inflation. 
Eligius is over reacting (for now). I dont think it is time to take these measures, but we do need to fight against the ability to taint coins. Decentralization and community control is a fundamental part  of bitcoin. If this becomes a thing, it destroys that. The transaction checking services would be in control, and they could be manipulated. We cant let that happen.

I posed a similar question yesterday. At some point after maintaining $300+ for long enough, it will be the new norm. When is that is the real question? I think we still need some more time, and we need to find the right spot in $300+. Is it $300? Is it $350? Is it $500? We wont know until we stop getting surges and corrections, then hold that price for a little bit and my confidence will build a little.

You can fund CampBX with USPS Money Orders ($1.15, I think), personal checks (after completing KYC Verification), and Dwolla (after 31 Days, careful, in that 31 days your account is basically locked out, no cash or coin can leave via any method without opening a support ticket). All of that is MUCH cheaper than wiring money to Mt Gox, and the prices on CampBX are much lower. Bitstamp would still require you to wire money, but at least the prices are lower. 
I personally use CampBX with Dwolla, and it is a really good combo, though it was a pain to start. If you are used to paying the fees though, sending money via money order is considerably cheaper and much quicker, since they credit your account the day they receive it. If you decide that is the route you want to go, definitely sign up using my referral link below, and we both get 10% back from trade commissions, which they add at the end of the month. Always kind of nice to get a couple bucks back! 
Oh, and if you have questions about the whole Dwolla thing, let me know. Their site doesnt explain it, and you REALLY need to realize that NOTHING will leave your account until the clearing process is done, unless you open a support ticket. I had to do that, and then it reset the counter back to 31 days :(

How much extra cash do you have? All of our situations are different, and you have to consider that you could lose all of it. With that in mind, definitely dont draw on student loans and such to buy it. Instead, skip going to the movies a few times, dont pickup a video game that you were planning on, etc. You could spend $35 and get 0.1BTC, which would be a start.

If a miner includes a transaction in the block they mine, they receive the fee. The reasons to not include the transaction are few. A miner might not include a transaction if there isn't enough room in the block (not currently an issue, but soon), they might not include it If they felt it was somehow invalid (attempted double spend), and they did not pay a fee as a way to deter others from doing the same. 
The market based system will basically allow fees to be dynamic. If there are a lot of transactions and you want to be certain it will be included you will pay more, if there aren't a lot of transactions going on right now, that same certainty would cost less. 
@_date: 2013-09-01 01:10:52
That isnt entirely accurate, Coinbase claims to buy from many different exchanges. They likely buy from Bitstamp because the Gox price is skewed, and CampBX doesnt have enough volume. I would assume that they have a contingency plan to be able to switch buying to both CampBX, Mt Gox, and probably BTCE if needed. 
Edit: They may also have back room deals with other vendors like Bitpay, and they can of course sell the Bitcoins that their customers are selling to them, including the Bitcoins that merchants are accepting and converting to dollars.

Believe me, that crossed my mind for a brief moment, however I like Coinbase, and I would like to continue to use their service. I did buy a reasonably large amount of coins while proofing the exploit, but I intentionally tried to keep from going to far, and my wife was making me give her daily updates to keep me honest. I never manipulated it below $100, although I am about 95% sure I could have manipulated it down to $1, even though that would have raised some red flags.
The biggest issue for me was the community. If it became obvious that the price could be manipulated, people would lose faith. That hurts everyone in a big way. Furthermore, if it had gotten out of hand, US financial regulators may have intervened (or Coinbase may have asked their help to find the problem), which would also be potentially damaging, and possibly open me up to criminal prosecution. Disclosure was ultimately in my best interest, and doing so sooner rather than later was the moral thing to do.

The problem is that the miners also hold a disproportionately large amount of coins. 
What would likely happen is most users would run clients running both versions of the fork to see which survives. Ultimately, the fork that doesn't screw over the wealthy miners will succeed.

Sure. You select an ad that you are interested in, there will be tons to choose from. If you have someone local, I would use them. If not, there are lots of internet options. Each seller has feedback next to their name, so you can see if they have a good rating. You will enter a dollar amount or bitcoin amount against their ad. I personally like dollar amounts, because I hate change. You will then follow their payment instructions. 
The coins are in escrow the entire time, so if something goes wrong, you can file a report and the site will give you the coins. Likewise, if you dont pay, the seller can get them back. Be sure not to leave an escrow open for a long time, or mark it as paid before you have paid it because that hurts the seller. 
If you are interested, Im SouthBend-BTC on LocalBitcoins, and I sell via Western Union, MoneyGram, Chase Bank deposits, and occasionally MoneyPak.

It could be done, and it could be done automatically, like you thought. This is where it comes down to a potential software fix. There is no way to simply blacklist these people, because they could use a different address each time. In my mind the thing that makes the most sense is first transaction to populate to most nodes that includes a fee is the correct one. The bigger issue at hand is that would be very difficult to convince companies that the miners will indeed follow the established norm and not allow the double spend. What if a mining operator is the one doing it? If Slush decided to not implement this for a block of preset addresses he has already generated, he could walk around and try to double. He would only be successful on block he mines, but he has enough hash power to be successful SOMETIMES, and SOMETIMES is scary enough. 
Processing companies are already in the business of risk. Bigger risk, bigger reward. It is really up to them to determine the risk and then determine the price. If the price is similar to credit card processing, it will look much less appealing. Furthermore, they may not even be ready to evaluate the risk, simply because it is largely unknown. Right now these malicious people arent walking around, but give it a year and one killer double spend app and you will have every bad actor who is slightly tech savvy attempting double spends everywhere. It doesnt matter if they are successful, the attempts alone will be frightening and extremely damaging to our credibility. People are often afraid of double spends for silly reasons, like the $4 coffee they want to buy and dont want to wait 10 minutes about. No big deal, 0 confirmation for that. Heck, even with $50 worth of clothes at Kohls, no problem. A $2k TV? That will start to make people nervous, and it should. 
Hopefully someone smarter than I am will come along and spit out a few possible technical fixes.

Sort of. You are still relying on Coinbase to protect them. Now, I think Coinbase is a reputable company, and I think if something where to happen they would do everything to correct the wrong, but you still dont have control of them. 
What people mean when they are talking about cold storage or paper wallets is YOU physically having control of the private key, stored somewhere safe. Coinbase allows you to generate a new address and print it out, that way you can have a wallet that is not exposed to the internet and is otherwise impossible to spend without someone gaining access to your paper wallet. I like to keep mine safe in my bank safe deposit box.

They claim to get their bitcoins from multiple sources.

Actually, Im not sure they will. They had stated they wanted to eventually expand the instant program again, however with the recent price increase, they probably dont need to.

Thanks for the info. I would suspect that someone at the store flagged you, or a buyer flagged you for fraud. A few days after I made that original post, I had someone at my regular spot tell me that they were supposed to report additional details about me specifically. I switched to another spot that I went to occasionally and explained to them what happened. The manager of that store thinks that me running a business is neat, and told her employees that as long as I have everything in order, I'm allowed to do whatever, because it is good for the store.

Bitpay reduces the risk, and I'm sure they can scale to handle larger customers. Keep in mind they might be dealing with $1M, but definitely not $100M in Bitcoin sales. Bitpay would handle returns, and it is usually the dollar amount. I think most people get that. If they implemented it online, there would probably be at least one confirmation, but even if there wasn't, Bitpay takes on that risk.

That is essentially what I was saying. I still think it will be more convenient for most people to simply over pay, and receive a (instant!) refund. 
This could actually be very good for parking, the rates could be dynamically calculated by how long people typically park their cars, and how often that meter is empty. If that spot is frequently empty, lower the rate significantly. If it is nearly always occupied, charge more. If it always occupied for long periods of time, offer a flat rate with no refund.

Communication. I emphasize this every time I talk to you guys, and after you made changes to the instant program last time, I was told it was going to get better. Just send an email out to all of the users. "We did this for this reason, sorry for any inconvenience". This would reduce the amount of hate mail you get every time you change something, and probably *save* time overall. 
I always feel like I get good responses from you guys when I email in, even if it takes a day or two, but the problem is that is reactive instead of proactive. If you need a community liason, I would be more than happy to draft emails and make posts as things are happening, for free, just to cut down on the amount of "OMG Coinbase did this" sludge that gets posted.

While they may not have a good exchange, a friend of mine tells me that they have a very large LocalBitcoins community.

You can cancel an order in the minutes after you place it. If you are in the buy screen on the website, there is a History tab. Click it, and it shows your orders.

I think this is a reaction to Coinbase. Even if you did $1,000 a day in Bitcoin transactions, it would take 2.5 years to work through Coinbase's "free" period. For large volume businesses, this is definitely a better bet, but for small businesses, Coinbase is still a great deal.

Coins are mined to fresh address 1 (FA1 for short). Coins are sent to a fresh address 2 (FA2). FA2 sends coins to FA3, and in return receives drugs. The drug dealer in his future transactions uses FA4, FA5, etc. If a sting is done, FA4 might get tainted, but none of his other coins have been tainted. 
Without using fresh addresses, this is what happens. Coins are mined to a fresh address (FA1) coins are then sent to FA2. FA2 sends them to address 3, which is not fresh (A3) and in return, they receive drugs. Now A3 had previously been involved in a drug sting, unknown (yet) to the seller. A3 has been marked as tainted, so all payments he receives are tainted. 
If he had used a fresh address every time, only the coins from the sting transaction are tainted. Since he wasnt using a fresh address every time, all of his coins are now tainted.

Because revolutionary ideas take time to build. If everyone sits around and waits for a new idea to be fully developed, ready for prime time, and wildly accepted, we would never have innovation. 
Yes, we often ignore the risks in this sub, probably half of us are comfortable with them so we don't feel the need to rehash it every five minutes, and the other half will be crying after the next major correction, but infrastructure and bringing the divide from where we are now to consumer usability is one of the largest elements of risk. We know it's not there, but we also trust that it will be eventually. Coinbase, despite all of the hate, has done a lot in that regard for the US market, and companies like Gyft have taken huge risks to be the first to market with easy to use services that already have mainstream appeal. 
Innovation takes time and involves a lot of risk. If you can't understand that, you shouldn't touch Bitcoin with a 10ft pole for another couple years.

To everyone fapping over this being a state-owned telecom, you are really underestimating the amount of autonomy state owned companies are given. There is not a government official approving every action. The state owned companies are expected to turn a profit, and they must compete to do so, often with other state owned companies. Anything they can do to gain an edge is worth doing.
The state, and the Communist Party, dont care what they are doing unless it is generating negative press, losing money, or they need to tap the company to help the state or the party (or take a bullet).

For one, it would make mining really unpredictable. That would have been okay in the old days, but know that mining is a really competitive sport, this would make calculating mining profits impossible. 
Second, transaction fees do this already. As you pointed out they are small, but the theory is exactly this. You include a lot of transactions, and a lot with fees to gain the extra reward. A variable reward is not needed because the transaction fees already include a variable reward. At this point mining fees can be several hundred dollars, it is worth it to cram every last transaction in there. 
Third, final, and most important. We have already seen what a crazy difficulty and dramatic hashing power increase can do to the network. We have already gotten ahead on block generation. Imagine how far ahead or behind we could get on coin generation if the block reward was already varied. Even if it readjusted frequently, it would still have the potential to get very off.

I have had a couple glitches here and there, nothing that wasnt sorted out. I did have an issue once where the app crashed while I was buying coins, and the coins didnt immediately show in my balance or my pending, so I redid the purchase. Naturally both purchases showed up. I filed a support request, but knowing it was going to take a few days I had my fiance front me some extra money (transaction was like $500). I had instant, so I hung onto the extra BTC hoping support would cancel it. The next day I checked the sell price, saw it was more than I had paid, so I sold the coins back to them. All of the transactions hit my account on the same day, so basically I was charged for both transactions, but received a credit larger than the second transaction. Worked out pretty well.

If you havent already signed up for CampBX, sign up using a referral link so you can get 10% back on your commissions. This will be something like $11, which isnt a whole lot money, but no reason to leave cash on the table (shamless plug, here is my referal link 
You should probably make your purchase over a period of time. I personally would probably do something like $5k/week, and break that $5k in smaller chunks through out the week.
If you were planning on using Dwolla, make sure you let your account age first, otherwise you wont be able to use your account for 31 days. If you dont want to wait the 31 days, do your KYC verification and mail a personal check, or send them 20 $1k postal money orders. 
I would use an Electrum seed instead of a traditional Brainwallet, if that is the route you want to go. Paper wallet backups might also be handy, and could/should be placed in a bank safe deposit box for maximum security/preservation. 
Lastly, this is a LOT of money. Only you can make that decision, but if this is a significant amount of money to you, you might want to consider liquidating a small amount in six months or a year, so that if there is a crash or Bitcoin ultimately fails, you arent out a full $20k.

They don't charge sellers commission, and there are no disputes, because buyers and sellers don't communicate. Buyer deposits money, sends site receipt. If the receipt doesn't look counterfeit, they release coins. If the receipt looks counterfeit, they ask the seller to verify the money is there.

I phrased that different than I intended. Have it adjust at the same time difficulty adjusts, measuring by orphan transactions would be a good idea, however addresses could be spammed with no fee in an attempt to create orphan transactions. For instance, someone could spam "correct horse battery staple" in an attempt to drive the block size up. I guess it is a moot point though, because even though the block size increases does not mean miners have to generate blocks that size. It could be something like the historical size of blocks in the last round, then factoring in the number of orphaned transactions. 
@_date: 2013-10-18 18:06:36
That is extremely unlikely, if it is possible at all. They cant explicitly ban them, because there would be First Amendment challenges. They could try to regulate them into the ground, but there is enough of an industry building around them that it would be very painful for a lot of people. In other words, it isnt something FinCEN would do on their own, it would have to be the result of Congressional or White House pressure. I feel that elected officials are unlikely to put this level of pressure on them, since there would be election repercussions, since even non-bitcoin users believe that we shouldnt be squashing technical innovation.

Couldnt someone theoretically generate a wallet with that address eventually at some point? Or is there something that prevents a wallet from being generated if there are existing records on the Blockchain to a specific wallet. I assume that is the case, since if someone could by chance generate the same wallet someone else is using, people would be scared shitless storing large amounts of coins. 
@_date: 2013-07-14 23:00:56
Make sure the seller is using escrow. Initiate the transfer, be sure you can pay it almost immediately. If they are using escrow, the coins are unavailable to them, so please do the transaction quickly. Next, go to make the payment. They should include instructions, and if not, either cancel the transaction or wait for them to give you instructions (depending on how fast you need the transaction done). 
Make the payment, mark it as paid, and they should release the coins. Simple as that. Just be sure you can do the transaction quickly, because Im sure several traders are like me and dont have large reserves. If I have couple slow transactions in escrow, it can prevent me from doing other transactions that are more profitable.

I will give you that one. Part of it is a social problem though, because we have grown to accept it. We cant simply legislate it away, because we would have to rely on those who we are trying to change.  Our society needs to become more active in the political process and vote not based on party, not based on who has the most polished campaign, and certainly not based on who is the "obvious" (handpicked) candidate. We need to start voting based o who will represent us. Not who we think will be better on this issue or that issue, that is less important, but on who will represent the desires of their constituents. Society needs to stop saying this is a problem and start acting like it is. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 21:38:52
So jealous. The US has no such system. Like I said, you have the systems like "Quickpay" which are "instant" within the bank (still takes several minutes or more, on more than one occasion it has taken over 24 hours to arrive). These will also typically work to external accounts, but you have to supply an email or SMS number and they send a link, the recipient enters their account info in there, then the bank performs an ACH to the account, which takes 1-5 business days depending on the banks involved. That brings me to my next paragraph:
For almost anything that isnt international wire (SWIFT) we use ACH. ACH is slow and takes like 1-5 business days. It clears like a check, and the bank can arbitrarily chose to hold the funds or delay the transfer. While typically consistent in transfer times, it isnt always predictable. An ACH to the same person might take two business days 9/10 times, but that 1 time you actually need it to take two days, it will take five. Throw a banking holiday in there, and it gets really random. This is how we move money domestically for everything. Need to pay a utility bill and dont want to use a credit or debit card? ACH. Buying bitcoins from Coinbase? ACH. There simply arent other options.

Less than $10k wont *require* reports (unless you are structuring, IE doing $2k a day for 5 days, doing $9999, etc). Now, if things are "suspicious" they can file a report, and many of the banks do this automatically. Suspicious activity can include, but certainly not be limited to, receiving/making wire transfers to foreign countries, depositing or withdrawing amounts that are out of "pattern" for you, both of which are likely if you are taking bitcoin profits.

I don't understand why some people think there needs to be a distribution of wealth. Can someone explain that to me? Bitcoin seeks to disrupt the banking, currency, and payment sector. It does not, nor should it, try to disrupt the wealth gap, except for no longer passing off the benefits of inflation to a select few.

My point is though, if it is costing you $10 to run, and generating $8 in BTC, if your purpose is to obtain BTC, then you should just buy it. Now if you want to help secure the network, or contribute something to BTC, then by all means, let it run! But if you are letting it mine because someday the $8 in BTC it generates will be more than the $10 you spend in electricity, then it would be more efficient to just buy the $10 in BTC, save the electricity, and then when the price rises, you will actually have more BTC than if you obtained it through mining.

I'm not saying it is like this for all companies, but I think you misunderstand the whole "keeping money overseas" thing. In the majority of cases, this is money they *earned* overseas. They may have even paid taxes on it overseas as well (but not always, some countries expect you to pay taxes in the country you are HQ'd in). In order to bring this money home, they have to "repatrionize" it, which involves paying taxes on it, taxes which may be redundant. Keep in mind, this income was not earned utilizing US services. 
This isn't being greedy, it's just good business. They can keep the money outside of the US, reinvest it in their international operations, and carry on. They don't want to, and shouldn't have to, pay taxes on money earned outside the country that will be reinvested outside the country. 
Now, if they want to pay dividends, if they want to invest it in US operations, or they want to close international operations, they bring it back, and they pay taxes on it. I'm also going to acknowledge that there are circumstances where this is taken advantage of to an extent, but it isn't as if Microsoft can make a billion dollars selling Xboxes in the US, move the money outside or the country, then never pay taxes on it. It just doesnt work like that. Even if they could, they would have to bring it back at some point to pay investors, and they would have to pay taxes on it then.

The Chinese buying already has had a big impact, and I think it will continue to grow as we start to realize how extensive it is.

There really isnt any getting around that, electric bills dont pay themselves.

What I got out of the OP was that the fraudster rushed with a TON of information, then likely pressured them to resolve it quickly. Its unfortunate that they did not give the seller (OP) enough time to respond and prove his case, but my guess is if they were using SMS instead of the message system, they probably assumed that there was a lot of poor communication, or that the seller was being unresponsive. 
Of course that is all conjecture, I have no idea why they did what they did.

Is Square and BofA aware of your business? Like really aware, not some low level chump that signed off? I seriously doubt they will maintain you as a customer when they realize the nature of your business. I could be wrong though, especially since it sounds like you are working with "paraphernalia" instead of the actual marijuana. They may even more tolerant if you have branded yourself as a "novelty glass products" shop instead of a smoke piece shop. 
As far as Bitpay/Coinbase refusal to work with you, they have to work within the confines of the old banking system, which frowns on your type of business. Im not saying this is okay, Im just saying it is a poor representation of bitcoin. These are separate entities, and eventually a more neutral system will come out. I have posted a few times on here of a vision of an open source platform that could easily mimic what Bitpay does. After the holiday I am hoping to work through my backlog of projects and recruit some help in laying the foundations of this project down so that others (more skilled or with deeper pockets) can come forward and complete my vision.
@_date: 2013-09-02 05:43:13
This is precisely the point I was going to make, however I couldn't have spelled it out nearly as well, so let me add the tldr. 
Bitcoins don't gain value. They hold their value, and fiat loses its value. Bitcoins appear to gain value because we judge their value in fiat. If a bitcoin appears to be worth twice as much fiat in 10 years, it is because fiat is worth half as much, not because the bitcoin is worth double. 
We don't see this right now, because we haven't found what the true market value of bitcoins are. Once we get past speculation, this will be the case.

Sounds like you already reached the correct conclusion, but it should also be noted that you shouldn't factor the increase in Bitcoin value into your ROI figures. If you have to assume value will increase, you are probably better off just buying and holding bitcoin. You should figure out how many BTC you can buy with the given amount of USD, then estimate how many BTC your hardware is capable of mining. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 04:59:46
I can see the validity of that, but I also think that if the money is with the miners, and the miners decide to stay with Fork A, the exchanges and business community will also be tempted to stay on Fork A, even if they feel less secure. Another possibility would be services operating on both forks, being indifferent to the race to become the Victor. This again gives an advantage to Fork A where the money is. It also means that both forks are probably doomed. You split the user base, you essentially double the amount of coins in existence. 
Ideally we need to resolve this civilly. We need to get people to move to smaller pools, and we need to get more people mining, even if it is barely breaking even or at a loss.

Basically. I mean, you get to deduct out your original investments, but in your example they are basically non-existent.

Tyrant? We don't listen to them. The good devs break away and hard fork. People will always do what is in the best interest of Bitcoin because they will have a stake in it too, and if they screw it up, it will fork and their version will be worthless. 
If we have good devs but evil miners, then we go back to square one and mine with GPUs and Block Erupters. The decentralization is real. The devs are separate from miners, and if one faction becomes evil, the good remaining can fork and carry on.

The transaction propagates through the network much quicker than a confirmation, maybe not the speed of light, but relatively "instant" as far as money is concerned. You don't need to wait for a confirmation, although for larger transactions you may want to.

No. 
It will never execute above the limit price. If you put your limit at $100 with the offset of $5, it would have to fall to $95, then rise back up to $100 to execute. If it rose to $100.01, it would not execute. 
I have the best results with $1-$3 for the offset, although if I really want to make sure a buy will go through, I will often use $0.03. It triggers fast, but you still get it slightly lower than current market, and it will trail if the price starts falling. 
@_date: 2013-09-27 19:19:14
It really depends on how you define a large transaction, and the likelihood of malice. Only a fraction of users would even try to double spend, even less on a small transaction. Then you have to factor in the likelihood that it would be successful. Things like food, which have such a lower cost to the seller, I wouldnt worry about it. Retail stores? Maybe on amounts over a few hundred dollars. 
In a retail application I think the best option would be to add terminals to shopping carts (or just use a mobile app) that would allow shoppers to "preload" their BTC to their cart. They send the BTC, then when they go to check out if they sent to much, it gets refunded back. If they sent to little, they send the balance. If the amount was under the predetermined "safe amount", they are free to go. If not, they have to wait for a confirmation, which would remind them to preload better in the future. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:22:17
That isnt inflation. Inflation involves adding new units. Those mini satoshis already exist, they are just being counted by 10s as regular satosis. If the value of a mini satoshi increases by a factor of 10, so does a satoshi and so does an mBTC, etc. Nothing is being added. No value is being lost. 
This system allows bitcoin to function, even if 90% of all coins were lost. You simply divide it into more parts and keep going.

When the Federal Reserve creates more dollars out of nowhere, it makes my dollars worth less because there are more in circulation. When you divide a bitcoin into mBTC (1/1000ths) my bitcoin is still worth 1000th of your mBTC. That is why divisibility is better than inflation. If 1 mBTC is worth $10, my 1 BTC is still worth $10,000.

Obviously in the most literal sense, no, it can not continue forever. What I am emphasizing is that chips are going to get faster and more efficient, and this is going to continue for quite some time. This isnt going to stop sometime in the next year, and anything you buy now will likely already be losing money by next year. Eventually enough people will realize this, stop buying mining equipment, and the rise will slow. However, we will always have to contend with mining companies now, who will have such a massive overall hash-rate that even a small profit will still keep them mining.

I totally understand why they don't, but I'm a touch disappointed that we can't just wave a stat sheet around showing that Bitcoins paid for X dollars worth of Gamestop Gyft cards last year, so Gamestop should accept Bitcoin directly. 
Overall, Gyft is a silly expensive way for a company to "accept" Bitcoin. My mom used to organize fundraisers for charities and had access to a gift card wholesale store. Most of the gift cards are 10-15% off, I would imagine Gyft has a very similar margin.

Their USD funds are probably insolvent, but that does not mean they do not have the fiat to cover it. The people paying the 5% fee to get our early (if the rumors are correct) are probably covering extra labor (and some profit) as well as currency conversion fees, so they can convert their stockpiles of Euros or Yen to USD. 
I think Mt Gox expects to be legally operating in the US, and probably to even get their $5M USD back, so they delay the process as long as possible, knowing someday they can process them in a reasonable amount of time without it costing them a fortune to convert between various fiat currencies. 
Mt Gox has the money, it just isnt in US Dollars, and they are trying to avoid the cost of converting to US Dollars

Go get a personal loan from a credit union. They can still be had at cheap rates (I have 6.75% on mine, not terrible). Also lower the amount, try $5k-$10k. This reduces your risk level tremendously. It might hurt you a little if it blows up, but it wont reset you to nothing. Remember, never invest more than you can stand to lose. You have to absolutely assume this will go badly, just in case.

I have thought about this a lot, and LocalBitcoins, while not having the best UI, is still the best format, IMO. 
When you are dealing with things like bank deposits, Western Union, and MoneyGram, you have to remember that there is a customer service side to things. People may avoid certain users that dont have a high feedback, or users who are unable to complete the transaction quickly. There is no way for it to be "instant", because someone has to manually check the transaction. There is no way to get around it. Because of this, quality sellers can charge more because of the "experience" and quality buyers can pay less because they will be easier to work with. 
If you have a market system that anonymously matches people up, you will wind up with a lot of people on both ends making mistakes. New buyers will be get confused and send the money to the state, or not use the "Money in Minutes" option. Some sellers might not be available to complete their side of things, or they might only do it once per day. 
Im all for another distributed exchange that utilizes dynamic pricing, but I think in this instance it is best not to try to reinvent the wheel.

Man, that sucks. 
When I have problems, I email them using the contact button on the bottom of the page and start posting documentation IMMEDIATELY. It sounds like this guy was really planning on screwing you, so Im not sure what you could have done differently other than starting the dispute faster, and maybe sending a series of messages like "Why didnt you show up for the meet?". Oh, and always communicate over their message system. I avoid going outside of the message system, and always tell my buyers "This is so everything is on record if I try to rip you off". 
I have had three disputes properly cleared in my favor, but those werent for in person meets. It really seems like a he-said, she-said deal when meeting locally and dealing in cash. You could always say something like "I never met up with him, he didnt sign my bill of sale" or something, but at this point out you sound SOL.

Not dipping into savings is always wise. 
Use cost averaging, and either use Coinbase and buy the minimum over the course of a week or two until you have invested as much money as you would like, or see if you have a LocalBitcoins seller nearby that deals with small amounts. I service the Notre Dame area, and I do transactions as small as $10, but I dont know how typical that is. If you are at Notre Dame, Im more than happy to help!

It must have triggered (IE fell below the limit) then rise by the trail amount, but still be below the limit amount. Even if it is $0.01, above the limit amount, it will not trigger.

No, it still would. Same if you buy gift cards. If you are making a profit, IE the value has increased and you are utilizing that increase of value, no matter how you do it, you need to pay taxes. Period. Same goes for losses. If you bought in April for $266, then decided in July you were going to spend it all on Gyft cards, you can deduct the loss in value.

Keep in mind that the larger retailers have in house programmers and resources. I have said before that it wouldnt be terribly dificult to build something like what Bitpay does using the API for a couple major exchanges. You would create your pricing based on the bid orders in the exchange, forecasting a few minutes out (to account for confirmations and what not). You present that price to the customer, they pay, your system sells BTC you are already holding on the exchange and transfers over the BTC that you were just paid. Once a day an accountant logs into the exchanges and moves the fiat back to the main accounts. 
The advantages of doing it this way would be tremendous. For one, your only fees are going to be the small trading fee on the exchange, and a larger company can probably arrange to have that reduced significantly. Second, this keeps responsibility for it in house. If there is a hiccup, you can have your team working on it. If changes need to be made, you dont have to make major updates to switch providers (Bitpay to Coinbase or Coinbase to Bitpay). Finally, and most importantly, they can integrate it perfectly into their system with minimal efforts. Multiple payment options? Discounts? Manipulation of the value of a Bitcoin to encourage or discourage it as a payment method? All possible.

I believe we as consumers have gotten to used to someone else handling our problems. We are careless because we have so many safety net systems in place. Did that waitress just steal your credit card number when she walked off with your card? No worries. A company has a very poor web presence but great prices? Worst case scenario I have to call the credit card company, worth the gamble! Bitcoin provides us with true autonomy. If you want to take those risks, you are taking them yourself. The credit card company is not going to stand by to bail you out. If you want protections, pay for escrow! If this vendor was standing on the street, would you give them cash and expect to deliver? Same thing. 
BFL is an interesting situation. Perhaps if they had only taken BTC, they would have never even made it to production. Then again, maybe they would have received actual funding, rather than trying to pseudo crowd fund their hardware. Its hard to say. The old system is still in place though, so why not use it to put a company  down who would have likely taken the BTC and ran. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 07:32:23
Short term alts might increase, but if you aren't interested in managing a handful of currencies and trying to keep up to date on their news, just buy Bitcoin. Bitcoin is risky, but alts are even more so. Personally, I have my doubts that most of the existing alts will still be around in any substantive form in 5 years. 
If you have any high interest debt, definitely consider paying part or all of that down before putting money into Bitcoin. While we all like to think that Bitcoin will be huge in 5 years, there are no guarantees on returns. If you have something weighing on you, take care of it now! Bitcoin could go away, your debts won't. If you don't have debt that needs to be paid down, have adequate savings and non-bitcoin investments, and you are comfortable losing part of all of your $6k, then jump in! If you aren't to that point, throw some cash in the bank and buy a couple CDs (stagger them a little so they mature at different points). If you want to still buy Bitcoin, you definitely should, just make sure you invest a little into less risky things so you are well rounded.

Since he doesnt have bitcoins already, he should probably use LocalBitcoins for both ends, acquire BTC via LocalBitcoins, and prearrange for the recipient to receive cash in the Philippines via LocalBitcoins. Once the person receives the cash, he (or the recipient) could release the coins to the buyer. It should cost virtually nothing, and if done right, he could even profit off of the endeavor.

Two things with that, one, pay your taxes and be a good citizen and good bitcoin ambassador. Doesn't matter if you don't think the taxes should exist, it's still the law, follow it. 
Second, if the IRS crawls up your ass, and discover that you use Bitcoins (ACH to Coinbase, wire to Bitstamp, etc) I don't have a doubt in my mind that they will be searching for hidden money and taxes they are owed. 
You never, ever want to deal with the IRS, and if you have to, you definitely want to have done everything by the book. If you hide from them, they will be vengeful. If you arent up front with them, they will torment you by looking at every year they can, and they WILL find any obscure fuck up you made. 
Don't fuck with the IRS. Not even once. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 20:25:27
It depends on your bank. They submit the ACH relatively quickly, but it might take a day or two for the bank to show it. I use Chase, and on a good week it is visible in my account the next day. On a bad week, three days later.

I was going to take this approach, but my wife is very hesitant. I have a personal loan that will be paid off soon, and I may just take the same loan so she won't notice. Take the loan at just under 5% interest, sell off BTC every month to cover the payments. If it hits a higher point, sell off extra to reduce principal. If something goes wrong, I was already used to paying that payment every month. 
Its kind of a high risk investment strategy, because your gains have to outpace interest. That has nearly always been the case though, so it could still be profitable. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 21:28:27
ACH is our low cost domestic transfer system, so for most US bank transfers, yes. For instance, Coinbase does everything via ACH, but they also lock you into the price, so it isnt a huge problem. It makes it impractical for day trading though, because your transactions take four business days to go through. If you want to send money to CampBX, a US based exchange, you would ideally do it via ACH (when he gets it working...) and again, 3-5 business days to clear. Now, if you are going international, you use the SWIFT transfer system, which can clear pretty fast, but it is expensive (I believe JP Morgan Chase charges me $25 each transfer). 
@_date: 2013-11-08 17:05:58
Email about it getting canceled, ask them to white list you and honor the original price. They typically will. Just keep in mind that they are very overwhelmed, so it might take a few days (or a week or more) to get a response. Be patient, and be polite, and you should get a positive outcome.

Their pricing is normally based on Bitstamp, but they claim to use several exchanges. I take this ot mean that they primarily buy on Bitstamp, but are able buy on Mt Gox and CampBX if needed.

Eh, but you are screwing the person who is paying electricity, so consider that. 
My point would have been that it would be cheaper, and have a greater impact to buy some bitcoin with the money you would spend on electricity, rather than waste it on mining.

I have always wondered this: If one is selling on LocalBitcoins, using a third party payment system (MoneyGram, Western Union, bank deposit, etc) how is that any different than selling on a traditional exchange? 
Mt Gox: 
Buyer wants to buy bitcoins. Sends payment via third party payment service (Mt Gox in this case) and receives bitcoins via third party service (Mt Gox, again). 
Buyer wants to buy bitcoins, sends money via a third party payment service (lets say MoneyGram) and receives them via a third party payment service (LocalBitcoins transaction service, or escrow). 
How is that any different?

This has nothing to do with purchase, this is transaction broadcasting. I have bought and sent 10+ Bitcoins at a time from them with a delay of minutes, and then this time, it took over 24 hours.

Uhm what? I think you are using the wrong terms. Inflation and deflation refer to an increase or decrease in monetary units, something that is extremely controlled and predictable with bitcoin, and will eventually taper to zero. 
I think you mean changes in value or exchange. Once bitcoin matures, the value will stabilize. There will always be some changes, but it shouldn't be anything that will wipe out someone's savings. If anything, there savings becomes more valuable, not less. 
@_date: 2013-10-08 15:59:45
I dont think confiscation of bitcoin would ever happen in the US, but everyone has to weigh those possibilities for themselves. If that is what you fear, I would definitely go a different route. Besides, if they find a paper wallet in your home, they are going to look on the Blockchain and know you transferred it, then they are going to want access to the wallet you transferred it to. In your scenario, you are far better off eliminating any trace of bitcoin. Keep it obscure, or keep it in your head.

No, not necessarily. We are still in our infancy, so yes, it can be difficult to get the little orphan child bitcoin. However he could easily receive a direct payment from an aid worker, or perhaps he has sold goods and obtained BTC. There may quite possibly be a local exchange market, or a regional movement where people are using BTC. Any of those situations would allow him to participate in the world market in a meaningful way. JPCoin likely wouldnt accommodate any of this. There would be to much AML/KYC going on to make it feasible, and participating in transactions in third world countries is often see as "scary".

@_date: 2013-09-08 05:26:38
No, I dont mean the value of the transaction fee will rise, Im talking about the value of BTC in general. If BTC is worth twice as much, shortly after the halving, then the miners are still getting the same value out of the amount of BTC they mine. Yes, they mine half as much BTC, but it is worth twice as much, net value of zero. Its not necessarily going to be that clean, but that is the concept, and the value will likely rise as there wont be a many new coins being dumped on the market each day, yet the demand should be the same or more. 
As for transaction fees offsetting some of the loss of block reward, eventually the transaction value is going to be large enough that the block size will grow, allowing more transactions per block, and therefore more transaction fees. Even if the fee amount is reduced because of an increase in value, there will be more transactions and more fees overall, adding additional value to mining. 
@_date: 2013-07-29 15:33:15
Check out LocalBitcoins, then see if you can buy the MoneyGram prepaid cards, where you wouldnt need to show ID. Or find a Western Union or MoneyGram where you dont need to show ID. Or trust your seller that the information is between you and them. My customers do any of the three. 
If you are doing Western Union or MoneyGram online, you probably wont need to use your real information, just make sure you provide the information that you put on the form to your seller. 
Feel free to PM if you need any extra help. I can work with you to be as discrete as you need, and I have a high rating on LocalBitcoins.

Im not accusing you of wanting to steal our money, but I personally wont deposit anything, or play using your site, simply because there is no trust.

This is something that a lot of people arent used to. The first rule of having money is to never talk about how much you have, for this very reason. Only a handful of people know that I have a substantial amount of bitcoins, and if those people ever ask for money or a loan, etc, I just explain to them that I really cant cash out for tax reasons (which is true). If you explain that if you have to sell a bitcoin to loan them money, and it will cost you 25+% in income taxes, they will drop it. If they dont, stipulate that they will owe you the taxes as interest.

The Internet isn't a central body. There could be a small disruption (and clocks wouldn't do it) but the traffic would just be routed around whatever the US government tried to do. 
Look at it like this, if you put up a barricade on a large highway, it might back things up a bit, but the second everyone figures out what is going on, they just go around it. They take a different road, they find an alternate route. Roads are everywhere, and it is impossible to block all of them. If you did manage to block the roads, you travel by air or sea.

It says 5-7 days because theoretically an ACH payment could take that long. It doesnt normally, but it could.

With Level 2 Instant, buy orders hit my account the next morning.

Or you could just buy more bitcoins after you spend them. If you are going to spend the $5 anyways, then it doesnt matter. 
@_date: 2013-09-04 12:33:40
Buy bitcoins. Spread about half of it around to various bitcoin related securities (ASICMiner shares, etc). Hold about 40% of the remainder in cold storage, and keep 10% of it in a secure wallet, so you have access to it should a good opportunity to invest it arise. 
Steer away from mining. You might make small profits, but you will likely make much more from BTC backed securities, and there is arguably lower risk.

Ah, but you have to remember that for basic day to day  purchases, confirmations arent needed. Pay the standard fee, no worries. It might take an hour to get included in the block, but who cares! 
Alas, this system is MORE efficient. If you want priority, you pay to play. No rush? Save that satoshi. A truly free market works incredibly well, we have no reason to think that it wont work equally well when applied to transaction fees.

Paging I gave sympathy for you OP. I had a situation where the Android app glitched on me, didn't show my purchase or reflect in my balance, so I duplicated the purchase. An hour or so later, both showed up. I didn't have the cash in my account and had to grab some cash from my wife's account (we don't touch savings, at all, ever). I emailed support immediately, and it was a week or so before hearing back. By the time I had heard back from them I had sold the BTC back, but the transactions never hit at the same time. It all worked out, because I thankfully had access to the money, but I can see how this could happen. 
This was all on their old interface where the cancel function was buried. The new interface the cancel function is front and center, but they still don't have a cancel function for instant. I think this is something that really needs to be corrected. If you still have the BTC in your account, you should still have 5 minutes to cancel. 
Similarly, you should be able to cancel **sell** orders. I was very frustrated to find that when I accidentally did a sell instead of a buy from the app, I couldn't cancel it. I also couldn't buy back later that night when the rate fell back to where I sold, because I knew it would be several days before the money appeared.

Have her explain that you (unless she is capable of doing it) can help them look and see if there is anything, and that if there is, you can possibly help transfer them to the family, or exchange them for cash. Make sure they understand that it is unlikely you will find anything, and unlikely what you will find will be worth anything, but then sneak in that even 1 BTC could be worth X dollars. If they let you look, great! Help them out, be honest, don't charge any fees, don't take anything they don't offer. If they don't let you have access, and your sister thinks it's appropriate, offer to buy THAT computer, should they ever decide to sell it.

@_date: 2013-12-23 15:49:47
They do not, in fact, quite a few mining pools dont even pass on the transaction fees to the miners, only the block reward. 
When that time comes, the theory is not that transaction fees will increase, but rather the shear number of transactions will increase, therefore the total amount of transaction fees will increase. This combined with a more valuable bitcoin should be more than enough to cover electricity and expenses for mining, and hopefully a small profit.

If the mining profit is "guaranteed", they will mine (ASICMiner is a good example). If they can sell the hardware for more profit than they could make mining with the hardware, they will do that (also ASICMiner). Basically they are taking a low risk position. If the risk is low enough, they will mine. If there is less of a chance of that they will profit, or if they will make more selling the miners, they will sell.

I understand that some people may think they need to convert it back, but this is a huge pet peeve of mine. Anyone who receives BTC and wants to convert it back to fiat is completely missing the point. Take 15 minutes, learn to use it, and spend it. This is a good reason why you should always have a short conversation with anyone you try to give BTC to though, because it seems that first thought people have is "How do I turn this into real money?", not "How do I spend this like 'real' money?".
@_date: 2013-12-08 09:52:28
You took the wrong approach. I talk about BTC to a lot of people, and I try to get them to understand it and be interested, but I dont push anyone to get involved unless they fully understand the idea of creating a stateless currency, and how that could disrupt things. Those are the people I give the final push and personally suggest they get involved. I also give them a small amount to get started. 
If someone is simply interested in it as an investment, I stress how risky it is (and if they still want to get involved, that risk is on them). Im not saying we should exclude people like this, because store of value is a killer bitcoin feature, I just dont think it is ready for primetime. These are the people who are going to be weak hands, because they are in it for money, not for the idea. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 15:58:56

I have really positive experiences on both, and I use both on a regular basis. It ultimate depends on how you are going to use them. CampBX is great if you want to actively trade, and Coinbase is great if you just want to buy and occasionally sell. Coinbase offers 10 BTC per week instantly (after verification), which is especially handy. However, I find that my Dwolla deposits tend to clear faster, so after that 10 BTC I usually buy on CampBX. 
Also worth noting, CampBX will lock your account down after you add Dwolla. 31 days, no coins or cash leave your account without a support ticket. Because of that, I suggest you get both accounts open and let your CampBX account age before you start using it. 
Anyways, if you have any questions, I'm more than happy to answer them! I use both sites pretty heavily. Also, if you want a referral link to either site, let me know. The CampBX promo is 10% back on all commissions you pay, which is a great deal!

You are probably wrong, and here is why :)
If they were to get this off of the ground, they wont be able to do so without AML/KYC compliance, which means real identity will have to be tied in there at some step. Even if it is a third party, your identity would still be readily available, just with an extra subpoena. Think of this how Bitinstant worked, you could just Moneygram them the funds, but Moneygram still collected your identifying information.

There could be more places, but its not to bad. In the 'States I use Coinbase (pretty close to current market prices, but 4-5 days to process), CampBX (market prices/speculative, I can mail in a check or money order or use Dwolla), and of course LocalBitcoins. LocalBitcoins is nice when you need some fast, but it is a huge up charge. Gotta pay for convenience though. 
@_date: 2013-09-21 04:03:54
I think the simplest way to explain this is a large number of small transactions are bundled into one. If you were to look at how the transaction is broken down on Blockchain, you would probably see that there were many input addresses. This isnt the case with most Bitcoin transactions outside of these faucets and ad sites. 
Please give bitcoin another chance though! If you want to acquire bitcoin, the best way to do it is the same ways you would acquire traditional currency, buy it (exchange traditional currency for it) or do regular jobs for it.

They are a rapidly expanding company. They have hired two new employees in the last three months or so. They are the ONLY service that does what they do, but if you dont like that, by all means, use some where else. They do have some major problems, but your transaction getting flagged is not one of them. They need to focus on their nodes constantly acting up, and adding additional checks to reduce fraud. You have to understand that they have lost a TON of money to fraud in the last few months, so they are being overly cautious. If you had lost that kind of money, Im sure you would be as well. 
Its tough to manage a business that is just starting out, but has exploded in size in such a small period of time. Add in the fact that they have to have bank level security AND comply with FINCEN requirements AND deal with fraud and risk mitigation, all in a fast paced environment on cutting edge tech. 
Give them a break, wait your turn. Your problems arent anything more than anyone else has had to deal with. Be patient, let them do their job.

Growing pains! It is a small shop over there. This wasnt solely Coinbase, Bitstamp definitely had an opportunity to filter these out of the API too. There was actually some hesitation to pay me because they felt the issue was more with Bitstamp than their system, but lets face it, I could have made a TON of money doing what I was doing, so I think they felt obligated. Im sure they had seen this as well, and perhaps hadnt figured out what was going on.

Don't blame you there. I still only sell 1-3 BTC at a time on there, and sometimes it takes a day or so, even if I have the lowest price. They do just about everything manually, so I understand why they charge a fee, but I still think it is a terrible policy.

One, if your bank allows you to move $100k out of it without verifying  your identity, get another bank. NOW. 
Second, there would be an investigation. $100k (or even $10k) isnt the kind of money that they will just shrug off. With amounts like that they recognize that it will happen again to someone else if the perpetrator isnt found. Eventually it will trace back to you (how the hell are you going to anonymously purchase $100k in bitcoins?). Investigators arent morons, it would catch up to you pretty quickly.

Buy bitcoins, maybe some ASICMiner shares. You will not make ROI unless you spend thousands of dollars, and even then, it is very much a gamble. Also, figure your ROI in terms of BTC. If you figure it in USD, also consider the fact that an increase in BTC could have given you more profit if you had just bought and hold.

But you can't do that as a startup. They probably don't have gobs of money sitting around, and would basically be SOL if business drops off. Startups run off of shoe string budgets for a reason; they don't have massive cash reserves and they don't have a clear picture of the future. If things drop off, they don't want to have spent millions of dollars (if they even have that kind of spare cash) on hiring and training support only to let them all go suddenly, then in six months have to repeat the process when they get busy. 
This is a natural progression for any company, they are operating in the same way that any rapidly growing startup would. They run into some issues with communication, which could be improved, but outside of that, it's a pretty normal way to run their business.

This is how most Bitcoin accepting businesses that aren't Bitcoin only businesses do it. It's exactly how companies accept PayPal or Google Wallet, and similar to how they accept credit cards. At the end of the day, they want dollars in their bank account. They don't care whether it is PayPal, Visa, Google Wallet, or Bitpay, and they don't care if your account is denominated in Euros, dollars, Bitcoin, or Yen. They only care about getting dollars in their account.

Exactly. If they implemented some requirement that for "consumer protection" transactions must be reversible, that would effectively make bitcoin illegal, or would require all transactions to run through a third party, defeating the purpose. I dont really think this would be the case, but it is one of the few ways they can "outlaw" bitcoin without actually outlawing bitcoin.

You can get the micro shares and things on BTCO and the likes. Shares dont really "ROI" as they keep their value. Yes, they pay dividends, but it would be quite some time before the dividends cover the original cost. Shares hold their value, so if you spend 1 BTC on a share, it pays 0.05 BTC over the course of a year, then you sell it for 1 BTC, you have made a 0.05BTC profit. Similarly, if it falls and you sell it at 0.95BTC, you have broken even. 
In my opinion, BTC shares, stocks, and other securities are better investments than mining equipment right now, as long as you do your research.

Im glad you took the time to point out some of the new developments, rather than pointing at graphs stating how they look similar, and trying to whip people into a panic. 
It is true, things are different. I agree, we are growing at an unsustainable rate. I also think that ~$210 might be a little over valued. However, because of the growth in economic activity, I believe we are much less likely to see a massive bubble burst if everyone can keep their heads for a month. In the event that $210 is over valued right now, it wont take much economic growth to correct that. Basically if we can slow the growth of the exchange rate, we might be able to catch up and avoid a bubble. Of course, if we keep getting positive press, this may be unavoidable, and all of this could catch up with us in a rather dramatic way. Ultimately, no one knows what will happen, which is why it is important for n00bs and the well seasoned alike to keep a level head and just ride the roller coaster.

There is nothing to decide. This is common knowledge. CTRs only apply to cash transactions. That is why you can give a car dealership a check for $30k and it be okay, but if you walk in with $30k in cash you have to fill out a form. 
Let's look at it another way, there are people who get paid more than $10k in a pay period, that also uses ACH. Do you think those people have to have a CTR filled out every week? No, they do not. 
CTRs are filled out when the money will no longer be traceable. This is usually when cash is transferred. When an ACH is done, a check is written, etc there is still a paper trail to follow the money.

Go to your transaction history on the website, cancel the transaction, add your credit card, then redo the transaction. 
Coinbase is not an exchange. There are no exchanges that allow instant funding. Coinbase offers a very unique, convenient feature that many people abused and committed massive amounts of fraud with. If you dont want to jump through the hoops, by all means, go somewhere else.

I know that may be how the government looks at it, but it is very incorrect. Exchanges match buyers and sellers, they do not purchase the product they are exchanging. Again, no different than an OTC Exchange where third parties are handling both aspects of the "transmission". 
@_date: 2013-10-28 17:06:37
Click on "JSON". Go to Coinbase and view your transaction, click on advance, click on JSON. Copy what Coinbase has there, paste it in the "JSON Transaction" field on Brainwallet.org. Click "Send Transaction". That should broadcast the transaction. 
Then file a report with Coinbase so they are aware you had a delay in broadcasting. Tell them that you dont need a response, you just wanted them to be aware of it. They know this isnt acceptable, and I know it doesnt seem like it, but they have improved and this happens a lot less than it used to.

Nah, when dealing with Western Union and MoneyGram, I dont release the coins from escrow until I have cash in my hand. I have had a couple attempts at fraud, which can really throw you off since you have coins tied up in escrow for a few days that you cant access, but the dispute process is pretty easy, and they sided with me and released from escrow back into my account within a couple of days. 
As for in person transactions, I keep them to public places that I am familiar with and I (legally) open carry a firearm. I feel fairly confident that no one will try to rip me off, even without carrying, but I still establish a strict protocol ahead of time. They count the cash in front of me, set it down, and neither of us touches it. I release the coins to the address they have provided, then I pickup up the cash. I always offer to wait for confirmations, but so far just showing them that it was sent from my wallet has been enough.

Im glad it worked out. They have been pretty good helping me out with issue as well. 
Unfortunately, these things happen far to often. I barely trust Coinbase, not because I think they are dishonest, quite the contrary as they have shown to be very fair, but because I frequently have problems with transactions not broadcasting for hours on end (if ever) and issues like this where purchases and transactions simply disappear. I understand they have grown quite a bit, so I cut them some slack, but as a service that is supposed to be user-friendly and an easy gateway to Bitcoin, they have the potential to do some major damage and scare some new users into never wanting to try Bitcoin again.

To parallel what others have said, use his assertions against him. Ask specifically how Satoshi would do this and why that makes it a scam. If he brings up the fact that he could sell off all of the early coins to drive the price down, ask how that is any different than if Mark Zuckerberg sold of his shares of Facebook.

I would recommend using Bitpay or Coinbase, both have easy to implement payment buttons. If you are converting to dollars, Coinbase is a good solution as they process the first $1M in sales for free. If you arent converting back to dollars, it really doesnt matter, as both services will take bitcoins and forward them onto your wallet for free.

I think he wants to encourage smaller mining groups, solo mining, and P2P mining. Upping your transaction fee just means that there is a big chance that you are giving a larger transaction fee to ASICMiner, 50BTC, BTCGuild, etc. 
I would really like to see a variation of P2P mining that allows tips to be sent then distributed to all the participants based on the total hashing power they have contributed in a given period. That way smaller miners could hash and receive rewards in addition to the block reward and transaction fees. The biggest issue I see is larger miners moving to that system and then capturing so much of the "tips" that it doesnt matter anymore.

If you are storing them in one spot, even if they arent on paper, they can still be destroyed in a fire, or otherwise physically damaged. If you encrypt the files, and spread them around, then they will never be lost or destroyed. Oh, and by all means, put a set on a thumbdrive and toss it in a bank box.
My strategy is this:
Encrypted files on DropBox
Encrypted files on Google Drive
Encrypted files on my Work computer
Encrypted files on my home server
Encrypted files in my bank deposit box
Encrypted files in my personal safe

They do buy as well as sell, but I suspect they also bring in outside coin. You get your coins instantly with Level 2, but even under normal conditions it can be an hour before your transaction broadcasts, then you have to wait on confirmations. Good for buying, not so good to use as a wallet.

First things first, I would move them to a fresh wallet. Second, I would do everything I could to secure that wallet, possibly move the coins into a couple of different wallets from there. Third, I would try to figure out where they came from, and I would look around on and Bitcointalk to see if any noobs just screwed up a massive transfer somehow. Finally, I would contact my lawyer and ask his opinion. If there were any other things I needed to do to legally keep the coins, I would. Then, I would cash some out, cover some major things like the mortgage on my house and my car payment. Maybe replace my wife’s POS car. Then, continue living my life. I might take out 1-5 BTC a week to have some extra spending money, but outside of that, I would just work my day job, continue with my life plans.

How does the escrow operator enforce the payment of fees, without requiring merchants pay fees up front and needing to maintain fixed fees? Most e-commerce sites and escrow operate on percentage based commissions. 
I'm not saying people wouldn't change for a better solution, this method is obviously superior, but merchants may not like paying their 1% up front and not having control over the process. Likewise, site operators aren't going to be keen on charging a flat listing fee when the merchant might be selling something for 100 BTC.

I think the number was more like 32k or 26k (I have heard both floating around). The 600k number represented the total sale amount, not the amount the site had on hand. I don't think 26k/36k will have that much of a hit in the grand scheme of things, and I'm still questioning if they have access to the private keys or not. If they haven't moved the coins out of the site's wallet, don't be so sure they won't disappear. Even in evidence, I'm not so sure that one day they won't disappear, unless they transfer them to a wallet and intentionally destroy the private key.

Obviously if someone was aware of it, they would check, but chances are if someone is remotely controlling your computer, and you are close enough that short range Bluetooth 4.0 will connect, you are going to notice something. Yes, it might be slightly less secure, but to me it seems like a nice balance between security and convenience.

Usually for me (I bank with Chase, have all Coinbase verification) it is four business days. Buy on Monday, receive on Friday. Buy on the weekend, receive the coming Friday. However, we had a bank holiday this week, so that sets everything back a day.  Your time is typical, and an unfortunate inefficiency of the ACH system. Nothing Coinbase can do to speed that up, unfortunately.

I was the one selling. The sell orders I was generating, then carried through to Coinbase's pricing, causing it to drop to the price I was selling piddly amounts of. That then allowed me to buy on Coinbase at the same price I was selling on Bitstamp. So if I was selling BTC at $100 on Bitstamp over and over, eventually I would be able to buy BTC at $100 on Coinbase, and I would buy significantly more than I had just sold on Bitstamp.

Honestly, it is probably less safe. As someone who works in corporate IT, you would probably be a little disturbed at the amount of information management typically requests we save. Even if someone doesnt know what bitcoin is, they may later go digging through and stumble across it, or at some point someone might go looking for bitcoin related files in the hope that they will find a wallet.dat, private key, or seed. 
Basically, I wouldnt risk it. You could probably take 1 hour and print off 10 new paper wallets, or you could spend a couple hundred bucks on a dedicated device (it could even be something like an Android tablet or old phone)

LocalBitcoins is probably your best bet. You will get a wallet on LocalBitcoins automatically, but you should still use something like Blockchain or Electrum. 
As for SR, please dont ask whoever you are buying your bitcoins from about it. That is one of my biggest pet peeves. I dont care what you do with your bitcoins after I sell them to you, I wont ask any questions, and you shouldnt be volunteering that info. Some of us run legitimate businesses and probably should end the transaction the second you mention SR. Ask those questions on the SR subreddit.

Certain forms of violence may be more severe physically, but its impact on society is the same. People will still feel unsafe whether the problem is stabbing or shootings, and people feeling unsafe will still destroy a community and be detrimental to local culture. 


That depends, if you could truly eliminate firearms from everyone, criminals included, then yes, it would be better. Until then, I feel that self defense is a fundamental human right and everyone deserves to be on the same foothold. Im not going to lessen my right to defend myself unless I have assurance that my assailant will be disarmed in the same manor. We all know that is unrealistic, so I will still insist on being able to defend myself in the same manor that I might be attacked. 


Im not blaming the victims, and while I agree that the South Side of Chicago is severely neglected, those that dont want to be there are able to leave, and many have done so. I would question why anyone would remain, but I certainly would not fault someone who is truly innocent for being there.

Based on what? Coinbase really has no clue what happens to your coins after you buy them. They have limits in place, you can't simply buy tens of thousands of dollars in coins per day, the limit is 50 BTC, and I have personally come right up against that a few times with no problems.

Per the other threads, they are working on this. Hang on. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 19:02:34
I want to expand on your points as well. 
1) They are working on implementing a system that will observe the network and determine what the optimum fee is. If everyone is trying to push transactions through, then the default fee might go up, if it is relatively calm, the default fee might go down. This would happen constantly so that you are never overpaying. 
2) You also dont even have to run a full node for an offline wallet. An SPV client does not require the blockchain to be downloaded and instead searches and compares the chain that other nodes are running, then latches onto the most common one. This makes it very, very practical to run an offline wallet. Users who want to run a full node will simply put up with the small increase in disk space required as time goes on.

Does it matter if you are cashing out investments? I doubt the bank cares about anything other than the fact that they get to play with $1M of your money for a few days until you move it elsewhere. Im doing mine all at once when I cash out to pay off my mortgage (2014? I hope?). Take the tax penalty all at once and be done with it. I guess if you are funding an IRA or have a different tax situation it will definitely be a completely different ballgame though.

Thousands of dollars in Coins bought, no major problems. I feel like 90% of the complaints are from a vocal minority who are A) New or B) Childish and incapable of interacting with a business in a mature matter. 
They are overwhelmed and under staffed. They need to work on communication. My biggest problem was the reduction in Instant purchases with no notice, and the constant slow broadcasting transactions. Sometimes I can manually broadcast them, sometimes I can't. 
On the most interesting accusations I have heard recently is that they are running some sort of fractional reserve scheme. I don't buy into paranoia and baseless accusations, but I would like to see any company operating a shared wallet or hosted wallet, exchanges included, periodically undergo some sort of third party audit to validate their solvency. 
Finally, I want to thank Coinbase for the work they have done. Like them or not, they are one of the easiest ways to get Bitcoins in the US. I know they are working their asses off, and and should be proud of the work they do.

You can buy bitcoins on Mt Gox, then sell them via LocalBitcoins, CampBX, or Bitstamp when you get out of the country. If you can get cash onto Bitstamp, that will probably be the best way to go about it, since you wont take a hit paying for overpriced coins on Mt Gox. 
As for actually moving the wallet, create a wallet and email your self the encrypted wallet.dat file, then decrypt it when you get into the US. With that much money, dont assume that you wont lose your computer/thumbdrive/whatever. Get the file online so you KNOW you will be able to retrieve it. It wouldnt be a bad idea to practice retrieving it in advance so you know your methodology isnt flawed. 
You could also create a wallet on Blockchain.info, that would already be online, and you wouldnt have problems accessing it in the US.

As far as Satoshi is concerned, that bothered me for a little while too. I ultimately came to the realization that there are so many reasons for someone to want to anonymous in a situation like this, so it is really impossible to say why Satoshi desires privacy, but it is very easy to understand. A handful of reasons are below:
The notion of Bitcoin is kind of "out there", especially five years ago. It could be a lot to stake ones personal reputation or career on something that would likely fail. 
Purity. If there is someone advocating for something, and they have something to gain, it makes people skeptical. If you can advocate for something that no one knows you created, you can seem much more credible. 
Fear of reprisal. Suppose someone thought Bitcoin was a viable threat to the status quo. If you wanted to to tarnish it's reputation, especially in the early days, you would tarnish the reputation of the creator. Arrest the creator for financial crimes, drug offenses, or something terrible like kiddie porn, and now it doesn't look so idealistic, it looks like a good way to launder money and pay for contraband. Think of the children! 
Privacy. This seems obvious. If you stand to have great wealth from a good idea, do you really want all of the crazies coming out of the word work to tell you there sob story and beg for charity? Even if Satoshi realistically thought Bitcoins could be worth just $100, the coins generated from the early days would mean a ton of money. 
There are hundreds more reasons. Like I said, it is impossible to know what combination of reasons led to that decision, but it is easy to understand why the decision was made.

The easiest way to buy bitcoins is via Coinbase (US only), and LocalBitcoins. Im sending you a small bitcoin tip via Coinbase's tip extension, be sure to accept it and setup an account! If you are interested in buying a large amount of bitcoins, you can also look at an exchange like Bitstamp, CampBX, or Kraken.

Depending on the location, Western Union may give you a check or cash. My primary pickup place limits me to $2,000/day in cash, so if I have big transactions, I have to start taking checks. The check provided is a Western Union money order, and to the best of my understanding will not bounce or be revoked. I would still cash it or deposit it ASAP though. 
Legality wise, if you do more than $1,000 a day in "currency exchange" with one person, you are supposed to be registered as a money services business, so I wouldnt make this a habit, nor would I advertise it much.

I have worked with USAA my entire adult life, and my parents have been members for over 30 years. This should be a fairly simple process, and they should be allowing you your wire transfer within a week:
1. Call them and explain what you are trying to do and the result from last time. 
2. Escalate the problem until it is solved or you get a definitive "No" from the highest person you are able to speak to. This will likely only be one or two levels above the first person you talked to, but you might have to wait on them to call you back. They will call you back. 
3. Take impeccable notes.
4. Gather your thoughts and write a coherent letter to their CEO. You should be able to find that info on their website, or you can PM me and I can look it up from the last time I had to do this. 
5. Wait. A day or two later they will get your letter, and a day or so after that you will get a phone call from an administrative assistant in their executive office. She will tell you that they received your letter, you are important, and that someone from the executive team will contact you. 
6. You will get a call from a manager in the department you are dealing with. They might have a question or two about what you are doing and why, definitely indulge them and be a good bitcoin ambassador. After they understand that you are not doing anything illegal or shady, you will be good to go. You will likely have also gotten the entire company policy reviewed, paving the way for anyone else who banks with them to do the same. 
USAA is very responsive to this type of communication, and it is actually encouraged. If there is a problem that impacts a customer and you are willing to put in the time to get it corrected, they understand that it means alot to you. While the CEO himself will likely not be involved in any of this, his office has shown that they are very dedicated to keeping the USAA experience alive and doing anything they can for their customers. If there are rules or policies in place that dont need to be there, and that inconvenience you, they are interested in correcting it. Remember, they are a member owned company. You get a dividend check every year, they work for YOU!
Im not affiliated with USAA in any way, I have just worked with them for a long time. They have been there for me through quite a bit, but like any company, sometimes things are wrong. Unlike many companies, they are always willing to fix it.

I think most people are suggesting uploading an encrypted file to DropBox, not that DropBox is encrypted. Then the thought with having your DropBox account secure is that only someone who worked for DropBox or someone who compromised your account (which is hard to do) would have access to your encrypted backup. 
Of course you are basically weeding out the incompetent. Anyone who might be able to decrypt your wallet can probably break into DropBox and get the file. Your best bet is security through obscurity. Obtain your bitcoins, distribute the heavily encrypted files to obscure places, and tell no one. Ever. EVER! No one will go looking for your wallet file with 1,000 BTC if they dont even know it exists, and  someone will be less likely to even attempt to break the encryption if they have no idea how many BTC is in there.

No. There is a delay between orders and how they are reported on the API that Coinbase uses. Additionally, they select random orders (orders happen rapidly and constantly) which they use to base the price off. This is why I had to submit dozens of orders. If you submit one order, it is very unlikely that it would have come up as the one that was then used for the price. If you submit several orders per minute for a few minutes, that chance would shoot up dramatically. 
Now, I never did this, but I fully believe that had I done this using $1 as the target amount, it would have still worked. They may have internal systems to flag orders with that much discrepancy, but I fully believe I could have forced the price down to $1 and bought against it, Im just unsure if they would have honored the price. 
@_date: 2013-09-22 10:48:10

There are some programs that will let you use your API key to access multiple books. As far as arbitrage, that would obviously help equalize prices across exchanges, but because it is long and difficult to get money out of Mt Gox (a wire transfer request might take two weeks to get processed, in addition to the wire time), it makes it impractical. You could definitely do it, but it would require a lot of funds being tied up for a long time. 
I hope you sign up on CampBX! I really think they should be the go to exchange, since they are based in Atlanta, and are very by the book. They also offer margin trading, which not all exchanges do.

Unfortunately the barrier to entry, while not particularly high, still requires people to WANT to enter. It requires a certain amount of effort and is not immediately obvious, which is a huge problem. That still doesnt mean you shouldnt try to convince him. Explain the costs (SWIFT will likely be $45+ dollars total, Western Union will come out to be 5-10% of the total amount, depending on the amount). 
Here is the blow by blow for doing it via LocalBitcoins:
He places an order with a reputable seller, I suggest either an in person deal or a bank deposit. If it is in person, he will give them cash, they will release the coins to his account. If it is a bank deposit, he will deposit cash at the sellers bank, send a receipt, they will verify and release the coins. Now that the coins are in his account, he places a sell ad near his recipient. His recipient meets the buyer, the buyer gives cash, and his recipient calls/texts/emails him, and he releases the coins (he could also just give the recipient the account info). Done. If he wanted to add complexity to it, but possibly profit slightly, he could place a Western Union add and have someone else send the Western Union to his recipient, then he could send the coins. This would allow his recipient to simply just go to Western Union and pickup the money without having to meet someone in person.

You have the process down correctly. Touch base with your vendor before making the deposit, there is no reason you should be waiting more than an hour for them to confirm it and release coins. 
Make the deposit as if you were doing it into your account, but using their info. Dont say anything about bitcoin, and on the very rare chance the teller gets nosey just say something to the effect of "Im just helping my friend out". Should ever happen though.

It is a similar thing, the outside world cant readily get money in/out, so they can stay in their own ecosystem. Now, Im sure there are some who have managed arbitrage between the markets, but for most of us, it just isnt going to happen.

I really, really hope I had clicked someones affiliate link at some point, and that some lucky fool out there is getting credit for the 70 or so bitcoins I have sold. 
Oh, I did notice that I have had 33 people click my link, and one signed up! Unfortunately, I think anyone clicking my link is probably buying, not selling.

Basically. They pair the order off. If for some reason the order doesnt come through, they still have the BTC to sell. If the price goes up, then they make more money. If the price goes down, that is the cost of doing business.

I prefer Northern Brewer (Midwest screwed me once and didnt shorted me like 6 ounces of hops, called about it on Wednesday and asked them to make sure it was delivered by Saturday so I could brew, and they didnt ship it out until Friday).

@_date: 2013-09-29 09:39:26
I will take a different position, since everyone has focused on security. 
Adaption. Why don't we see more regionalism currencies? When you have an established currency in a market, it becomes extremely difficult to convince someone that there is any real benefit that outweighs the inconvenience of dealing with multiple currencies. Bitcoin is established as far as crypto currencies go. Anything else is competing not only with fiat money, but also bitcoin, and also all of the other small alt coins.

Oh god no. That is a terrible idea. Use a regular Greendot card, or any of the other cards that accept MoneyPack.

I will own it, it is 100% gut feeling. My gut is saying that most of the "value" right now is from speculators and hoarders, and that we dont have enough economic activity to support $210. I know there is a lot of trading activity in China right now, but I have heard very little reports of how it is currently being used over there. Sure, there is a language barrier, and we have heard a couple things here and there, but it seems like every time a new cafe starts accepting bitcoin elsewhere in the world, it is front page news (on this sub). Hearing more about what is going on would over there would up my confidence that this isnt purely speculative. 
And of course purely speculative isnt bad, that is the point I was trying to get to in my OP. The problem is, actual economic activity needs to catch up in order to prevent a bubble from forming. 
Again, this is all out my ass. I have no numbers to back it up, this is just my observations and gut feeling. I have absolutely no shame in admitting that.

Sort of. You need to register with FinCEN to be a money transmitter (no, the $1000 a day exemption does not apply to money transmitters), and you may have local regulations to contend with as well. Also, remember to pay your taxes. Should you get audited, it will be pretty obvious to the IRS that is extra income, as you will have Coinbase withdraw amounts very similar to deposit amounts. 
You can make money doing it, but dont expect to make a lot of money doing it. I make barely enough money for it to be worth my time (note, I pay my taxes and am registered with FinCEN). As the price rises, it is less and less worth it. People used to not care they were paying 10% over Bitstamp when that was $10/BTC. When they see an $80/BTC price difference, they start to gawk. Most of my buyers understand that I am providing a service, and a lot of times they are first time buyers and just want that personal touch and advice about what wallet to use, etc. At this point I am more interested in helping people out than I am in making a huge profit.

I strongly feel, and not in a circle jerky way, that rumors of Bitcoin's demise in China have been greatly exaggerated. In reality, it wasn't a big thing over there. There was near zero merchant support, and it was all based on this broad idea that Bitcoin could be big in China, not that it already was. 
If/when Bitcoin accelerates globally, that is when people will be interested in using it as a store of wealth and as a way to move money in and out of the country. I would argue that at that time there could be complete absence of exchanges, and OTC trades could easily dominate. It would take no effort to move Bitcoin in, exchange it for Yuan, and either leave the country with said Yuan or simply live it up in China. This will be especially true if these gray market OTC trades fetch a premium. In the end, there will be a massive arbitrage opportunity to those who can get money out of the country and onto the exchanges.

Except that won't happen. There is enough money in Bitcoins from investors, VC firms, and users that no one world put this kind of pressure on FinCEN out of fear of reprisal. Not even the banking industry holds enough power to go toe to toe with thousands of people who just lost a collective billion dollars because FinCEN made that kind of ruling. If FinCEN did that, there would be Congress Critters involved, and they would lose elections because of it.

They transfered the coins into a different wallet. The correct way to do this would be to have one forensic team create the wallet, provide the public key to a second team who transfers the coins. A third team or a supervisor then makes sure that the private key or any of the wallet data isn't retained when it is stored in evidence. Chain of custody would keep track of who has had access to the private key in the event coins go missing.

So basically if the price rises, you want to buy it at the price you saw when paying for it, and if it falls, you want them to give you the better price? Or are you fine with paying the higher price (or receiving less BTC) if it rises? 
There are risks for them involved in investing the coins you have paid for. If something goes wrong, you probably arent willing to share that risk and take the loss. They lock you in at that price because there is no incentive for them to take the risk.

401k? IRA? Anything? If you have nothing outside of savings, you need to do that. Now. Still invest in Bitcoin, but invest less in Bitcoin so you can also invest in traditional retirement type investments. 
Assuming you live in the US, Social Security is going to look very different by the time we get to take advantage of it (Im about the same age).

The short answer: None. There is no incentive if you dont believe in what bitcoin is and can be, and arent interested in "investing" or anything. A few sites give small discounts, which is nice, but not a ton do. 
Personally, Im spending bitcoins because I have bitcoins, and I earn bitcoins, so I always have more. I am also making a habit of doing some of my day to day purchases in bitcoin because of what I want bitcoin to become - a true replacement for fiat. I also like paying in bitcoin for the same reason I opt to get $5 cash from my bank every week to buy a slice of pizza from favorite hole in the wall. I like supporting them, and I like reducing their costs. As a business owner, and someone who has worked in cost accounting, I realize everything counts, especially with small merchants. If I can save them $0.25, that is being passed to you in some way. At the very least, they are making more money which will make them less likely to increase prices.

You do realize this isnt a thing yet, right? This will likely never be a thing, since shared wallets exist and you could easily end up with tainted coins through no fault of your own. Furthermore, someone with tainted coins could simply mix them in with a shared wallet, and hope they dont receive tainted coins out. Its an interesting theory, I just dont see any sort of real world application.

You would simply purchase the bitcoins, send them to his wallet, and he would have to cash it out in his local country. He could do this on an exchange, using LocalBitcoins, or simply spending them. On your end, you would obtain Bitcoins in a very similar way, you would buy them on an exchange or from a site like LocalBitcoins.

By all means you should do your own research, but what others are trying to talk you is that mining a huge speculation, and there are a lot of risks involved. Most of the profitable miners are spending tens of thousands of dollars with promise of returns. 
Even if your research suggests something might be profitable, you must assume the worst situation. You can profit by simply buying and holding onto bitcoin, which has much less variables. If you are speculating on mining equipment you are making a bare minimum of the following bets, and must be correct on all of them just to get your money back: Rate of difficulty increase, device shipping on time, company selling the miner not going out of business (Terahash, soon to be BFL), company shipping the device with advertised hash rate, company shipping the device with accurate electrical usage, bitcoin still being worth something when you receive your mining unit, your ability to provide 100% up time on the unit, the unit not needing a warranty replacement requiring days or weeks of down time, etc. 
If you buy and hold bitcoin you are making three major bets: Your Bitcoins will not be stolen, your wallet password won't be forgotten, and Bitcoins will go up in value. Two of those three bets are entirely under your control too.

At the time they pulled their prices from Bitstamp. It was a random sampling of recently completed orders. I found that if I flooded Bitstamp with small orders of 0.01 BTC for the price I wanted, eventually Coinbase would pickup one of those orders, drop the price for a second or two, and I would use an API app with a limit order to snag coins when the price fell. I was grabbing coins for 25% market value, which could then be sold back to Coinbase for a profit. 
I reported it after a few weeks of extensive "testing", and Coinbase allowed me to keep all of the coins I purchased during my "testing" and paid me out 5 BTC. At the time 5 BTC was only like $600.

Common misconception. Coinbase isn't much of an exchange at all. If I had to put it in more common terms, I would say exchanges are like wholesale sellers, and Coinbase is like an end consumer or retail seller. Not the most perfect analogy, but it gets the point across.

The state legislatures? The Federal Government has their own registration, then just about every state has their own registration. The states dont *have* to have their own registration, they chose to. The federal registration is largely to prevent money laundering, where the state registration is typically more for consumer protection.

You missed the point I was trying to make. Why is it that someone participating on LocalBitcoins is a MSB, but someone participating on Mt Gox is not? The usual argument is that the Mt Gox participant is a customer of the MSB. My argument is that it is no different. I am a customer of LocalBitcoins, they take a commission, and they transmit the coins, and a separate third party transmits the dollars. Neither the buyer nor the seller is transmitting money. How is it not the same thing?

II think at 7-10 you are more likely teaching adults through there kids, unless that's kids are already part of a targeted audience more likely to adapt Bitcoins (kids of techie parents). There isn't anything wrong with this, I just don't think it will stick with the limited access to money kids that age have. 
12+ seems like an ideal age, since at that point they have better access to their own money (mowing lawns, helping Grandma out, etc), but it seems they might be harder to reach at that point. That actually gives me a really good idea, I should try to convince a local kid to mow my lawn every week for a set amount of Bitcoins.

It's not irrelevant. Most of the money is being counted two or three times before it is spent on goods, effectively this means that transaction volume is 1/3 of what it appears to be when compared to something like PayPal where all of the transactions account for some form of commerce or another. You also have to consider that some of the larger transactions are not going to be commerce at all, but rather just people moving to paper wallets and such. I will spell out why I think transactions are counted at least double:
I buy coins from Bitstamp. I transfer those coins to my blockchain wallet. I then spend those coins. Those coins have been counted twice. Alternatively, what actually happens normally for me is three times. I buy coins, I transfer them all to my Electrum wallet, then once or twice a week I transfer a small amount to my blockchain wallet to spend. Those coins have been counted three times. 
Now, for the really insane calculations. I buy coins from Coinbase, who has bought them from Bitstamp. Already those coins have been counted once. I then send those coins to my LocalBitcoins wallet to sell to a newbie. Those coins have been counted twice. The newbie then moves those coins from LocalBitcoins to their Blockchain wallet, counted three times now. Finally they spend the coins, counted four times. 
This problem compounds itself constantly. Suppose someone throws in a mixer, or transfers them to a paper wallet, then sweeps half the balance and transfers the rest back to a new paper wallet. 
**Simply put, the transaction volume on the blockchain tells us nothing.**

You can change the transaction fee, and right now it will still be confirmed eventually, even if it is 0. In time the transaction fee will go down, and it is a little imbalanced since the recommended transaction fee is the same as it was when the value was a fraction of what it is now.

Coinbase allows you to send Bitcoins to an email address, which is kind of what you are implying. 
Buying with PayPal will only ever happen if PayPal starts to sell BTC. They will hide behind "regulatory concerns" to avoid helping a competing service, which makes sense. Credit cards are way to risky for any seller, unless they can get am agreement with the card companies. I'm wondering if Coinbase has something along those lines, since they limit it to only Visa.

I'm disgusted with some of the responses in this thread. I'm easily the most greedy person I know, and even I wouldn't keep 60 BTC of ill gotten gains. If you think that amount is so life changing, think about how devastating it is for the person who loses it? Hell, even if it is Cryptsy taking the hit, that amount is not nothing. Someone could be employed for a year with that amount, or someone could be laid off because that amount is missing. Think about that for a moment, you would help yourself to a free $60k in BTC at the potential expense of someone else's job. 
Seriously, anyone who thinks this is okay should be ashamed of themselves, and certainly shouldn't be bragging about how they have absolutely no moral compass on the Internet. Actions have consequences, and nothing comes free. I sincerely hope that if you are ever put in a situation like this, it catches up with you in a rather spectacular way.

They have had time, I will give you that. However, it is extremely difficult to ramp up hiring in such a small time. Finding people is the easy part, the difficult part is figuring when the right time is, how much you can afford, and if your growth will be sustained. You can't just wake up one day and decide it is time. If you over hire or hire to soon, you wind up wasting money and laying people off, something that will make you much less attractive to investors and damage your reputation when it comes time to hire higher level employees.

Background: I found a market manipulation bug, and had a chance to talk about pricing with Coinbase, so I know a few things about how the pricing works.'
The Coinbase price works off of a sampling from the "last sold" price coming out of Bitstamp's API. It is a few minutes behind, and it does filter out sharp differences (well, now it does). Based on my understanding, when the price dropped on Bitstamp, it took several minutes for it to be reflected on Coinbase, and once it was reflecting, it fell less quickly, and never hit the same bottom. 
For the record, it did fall to $86.xx. I had a buy at $89.xx, and a friend of mine attempted to put in a buy at $86.xx, but received an error when attempted to order.

No, you can send an email to anyone. If they don't have a Coinbase account, they can have it sent to their wallet. If they don't have a wallet, they can create a Coinbase account. 
As for credit cards and PayPal, I disagree very strongly. Like I said, the only way PayPal will be on board, is if they are actively using Bitcoins. 
As for credit cards, that kind of defeats the purpose. This desire to buy Bitcoins with credit cards strikes me as extremely odd. Credit cards are the polar opposite to Bitcoins, as they represent the old system where a third party must be involved in every aspect of our lives. I think it is more important for people to understand *why* Bitcoins are better, than to try to shove them into it. If they understand why someone might want to use Bitcoins (independent system, no third party, irreversible, little to no transaction cost) then they should also understand why they can't buy them with credit cards. Look at it this way, using credit cards might bring users, but they won't be believers, they will be misinformed "get rich quick" investors with no real stake in the game. They are good for today, but won't be active in the system, which ultimately doesn't help us. If we educate them and they still buy in, then they will be more involved and more likely to buy more BTC and more likely to spend the BTC they have. That is what we really want.

Have you seen MPESA!?! Our banking system (US here) is BEHIND third world nations! If our Congress was actually functioning, the bankers would have their claws dug so deep into them to neuter BTC functionality if for no other reason than it is more functional than our "modern" payment systems, thus a threat to them on a functionality basis alone. 
Yes, Bitcoin is more functional than US payment systems. Only recently has it become possible to easily send money to another person electronically, but if they dont have the same bank as you, it will take 3-5 business days to arrive. It is still not possible for a consumer to accept credit or debit card payments without a third party that eats 3% of the transaction and delays access by several days, and dont even think about taking a check from someone you dont trust, because if that sucker bounces, the bank will charge you (the recipient of the check) $25+.

My understanding is there is a protocol for them to force things out to the franchises, though it might not come about until the franchise agreement renews. If they wanted to implement it they could do so by providing it in the newest version of the POS system, and sending out promo material like “Bitcoin accepted here” signs. If they wanted to go really far, they could have run a commercial and state that bitcoin was accepted as select locations, then locations could gauge demand by the number of “Do you accept bitcoin?” questions, and ultimately upgrade to the new POS, if they thought it would be beneficial. 
Right now I don’t see any of that happening, but if they flat out said “If you want to accept bitcoin, that is fine” that could be very encouraging for any other franchise owners to jump in.

You have the right attitude. My brother has always had a more contemptuous attitude towards my parents poor finances, and his relationship with them has been strained because of it. When bad things happened, he was often the only one in a position to help, and he often refused. My sister and I, on the other hand, have always lightly protested but ultimately helped. At the end of day, the entire family resents my brother for his attitude, whereas my sister and I are viewed as the good kids. 
With that in mind, understand that you can never lend money to family and expect it to be repaid. I'm not saying that it won't be, but always do it with the understanding that it probably won't, and don't lend more than you are willing to never receive back. It's difficult (if not impossible) to tell your parents "No" while living under their roof, but know that it is an option when you get older. It's also really important that you don't keep them up to date on your "wealth". It's a hell of a lot less daunting for them to beg for money if they know that you have it. 
And I apologize for the unsolicited advice, ignore it if you wish. I'm not that much older than you, and I have been burned many times by the "borrowing" of money by my parents. I wish someone had really explained the whole concept of "You will never see that money again" When I was your age.

The pool would have better payouts, and what would appear to be better luck (because they would have quicker block generation time, because they are holding blocks back, releasing them in quick batches). You dont need to know that they are a selfish miner, just that they are more profitable, therefore you join them. 
If they were to try to extort the network by saying "We are going to selfish mine, get on board or miss out" then the network could be forked to exclude them, or an update could be issued to cap hash percentages (not sure on the viability of that, definitely dont like the ethics)

Yes. They have cash on hand (and coins on hand), you start a transaction and have basically committed to paying X dollars for X coins. They then purchase X coins using X dollars to replenish the stock they will be giving to you. If for some reason the transaction is canceled or not paid, then they still have the coins which can be sold to someone else. That might result in a loss on those specific coins, but any one transaction is small compared to the whole. Similarly, it might work out that they profit extra on those coins.

And I do over estimate it, currently. I don't think I overestimate it so much that it could actually happen, if every technical innovator abandoned us and no one outside the community spoke up, it could probably happen right now. Thats the key though, NOTHING happens right now. We have a year until midterm elections, and the Republicans would still have to lose the House in order for something to get passed. Until then, Washington is preoccupied with partisan bickering. Destroying Bitcoin isn't something that is likely to unite them, even if outside pressure suggests it should. By the time Congress is functional in 3+ years, I think the Bitcoin community will be able to defend ourselves. Until then, dysfunction and trust in our allies will keep our enemies at bay.

You would exclude Gox, much like Bitpay does. Include Bitstamp and CampBX only, or even just Bitstamp. It wouldn't have to match Bitpay's service exactly, but that functionality should definitely be open sourced.

The point I was trying to make was more that Bitcoin users arent going to be X political party. People from all walks of life and all political parties have issue with the banking system. Right now I think Bitcoin for most people is still a payment system, and not a true currency (in that most people convert fiat to BTC, then convert BTC to fiat).

For the price, Im not sure why anyone would do this. Just take the cash, convert it to BTC yourself, and save the 4%.

BitStamp, CampBX, and Coinbase are all relatively close. Coinbase derives their pricing from Bitstamp, so it should be consistently ~1% higher.

The point is that just because you have a reduction in one area of violent crime doesn't mean that the violent crime disappears. Violence is perpetrated with or without guns. The reality is, despite what you might think and how the media reacts, gun violence is hardly a prevalent problem in most of the country. Only a small percentage of people are impacted by violent crime in any country, and those acts are disproportionately larger in lower income, high density urban areas. In other words, stay out of high crime areas, and your likelihood of being shot is comparable to any other form of violent crime in most other countries. Mass shooting and random acts of violence are not common in *any* developed country, including the US.

Which is one reason we need more clearly defined regulations. I suspect this is something that Best Buy's legal team could figure out, or get clarification on. I honestly dont know the answer.

Are you kidding me? He is not getting $100 for sitting on his ass, he is getting $100 for investing $10,000. Think of it this way, he loaned the bitcoin network $10,000. Currently they are paying him back $100 a day, but as time goes on, they pay him less and less so they can pay other people. Some day they will stop paying him. Will they have paid him $10000? Maybe, but at the current rate probably not. Difficulty is increasing well over 50% per month, and if it keeps up, he will not make ROI. He is probably more likely than I am on my K16, but still nothing like a sure thing. Not to mention, a that risk just to make pennies? No thanks.

Coinbase is very overwhelmed right now, they have experienced rapid growth the last few months, and are trying to keep up. I suspect things are especially hectic the last few days with all of the new users. Thankfully, they have some support reps that are on Reddit occasionally, so hopefully they can help you out. 
Paging @_date: 2013-10-01 13:20:14

I sent them an email as well, and Im sure they will get many more. I think the problem is that unless they are getting a rebate, they paid more than 3.5 BTC for those units, and they obviously are not going to be jumping through hoops to take a loss.

About half the time their system is running behind. You will still probably get it today, just give it another hour or two.

Or they can use Coinbase or Bitpay and not be exposed to the volatility. 
@_date: 2013-10-24 15:01:51
The order doesnt get canceled because of price increases, it gets canceled because it gets flagged as "risky". This can be for any number of reasons, and their system does yield a lot of false positives. If that happens, most people are able to email them, get white listed, and still buy their coins at the price they were originally quoted. If it was because of price disparity, they wouldnt sell at the original price. 
@_date: 2013-09-17 04:11:07
As a community it is important for us to be honest. If this had gone on for several more weeks, Coinbase would have lost substantial amounts of money. I think fraud was the largest reason they limited Instant, but I cant help but what wonder if this played into it. Or maybe the fraud put them over the limit because they were losing money because of price manipulation. Regardless, it needed to be fixed because it was so obviously wrong. Knowing the cause and doing nothing would be just as bad as deliberately defrauding them. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 03:30:22
Confirmed transactions don't necessarily tell you much about the block size though, the actual size of the block would have to be the metric, because if you have a block with a large number of small transactions, it could be the same size as a block with a small number of large transactions. (large referring to the data in the block, not the number of coins)

I was the one who figured that out. At the time they almost exclusively bought from Bitstamp. I don't think that has changed much. In the past they have bought from Mt Gox, and it looked like when they gap narrowed they were trying to exhaust their funds on Mt Gox. 
I believe your theory is relatively accurate, however now that it appears they have exhausted their funds on Mt Gox, hopefully they won't be going back. The last couple of days they have been fairly close to Bitstamp, and when they are off, I would chock that up to them using their own supply.

A confiscation of your bitcoins? Home invasions involving a warrant typically are over before you would have a chance to redeem a paper wallet. Why not just use a brain wallet, memorize an Electrum seed, or write your Electrum seed in the middle of a book. Any of those three are going to be more likely to succeed than trying to whip out a private key and sweep it. Plus, even if someone is looking for access to your bitcoins, you can still probably tell someone that you would like to read your favorite book in prison, gain access to the seed, and pass the seed onto whoever you might want to have it.

If he were to do it with bitcoins, he would probably want to go fiat into exchange -&gt; Bitcoin -&gt; LocalBitcoins for fiat. This solves part of the expensive issue, since LocalBitcoins can typically liquidate bitcoins for slightly more than you bought them in an exchange. 
This really isnt the best use of bitcoins though; its complicated, may involve wire transfer fees, and it is involving a third currency in a currency swap.

Earning income in bitcoin is a great way to help, since it is economic activity, and will encourage you to spend more! You get bonus points if you are doing work for someone who has an active bitcoin related project. 
As for your question about paper wallets, they aren’t a bad idea if you will be keeping them long term untouched. With paper wallets it is generally advisable to keep them in smaller amounts, because if at any point you have to “sweep” (redeem or use) the paper wallet, you should consider the private key to that wallet compromised. Paper is most secure if you are generating them offline, and keeping them offline until you transfer them to a new address. If we are talking about 10 bitcoins, I personally would probably do three 2 BTC paper wallets, and four 1 BTC wallets or one 5 BTC wallet, and five 1 BTC wallets. Its really about personal preference though, and how often (if ever) you might have to use the coins. If you are dealing with larger or smaller amounts, adjust accordingly, but just make sure you keep a few smaller denominations. You never know when you are going to have a personal crisis and need to redeem some. Like with anything else, don’t invest anything you cant lose.

My point is, I don't think we can get enough of the message across to Joe Ordinary to warrant the cost, and I think the status quo would be out in full force accusing us of pump and dump. 
I think it is to soon for this kind of marketing, unless it is being done by Bitpay or Coinbase on behalf of their merchant services. If the community or the Bitcoin Foundation does something like this, we have "anterior motives" in that we will see a price jump. If Bitpay or Coinbase did it their motives are clear, they are trying to get merchants to sign up. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 18:50:48

You will get what you paid for. It is kind of cool, and it can suck. My favorite transaction (I have Level 2, Instant) was one where my phone freaked out and duplicated a $200 order. I filed a support request, but within a few hours the price had gone up that I was able to sell back the duplicate order for a $5 profit. Everything posted into my bank account at the same time, so it all worked out excellent.

Small investors probably will fly under the radar, unless you are prone to audits. Large investors should know enough to pay taxes.

It would even out. Either enough people would stop mining that it would become profitable again (then people would start rigs back on, repeat) or more efficient equipment would come online.

I think the ID verification worked? I was on the tail end of my lunch break and I didn't get any big confirmation, but I also didnt get a fail notice? I will have to look at it more tomorrow. 
I see checking account as a funding option, is that functional? After Coinbase's little screwup with changing instant purchases, if you could add a level that included ID verification and credit checks, then allow instant funding from checking accounts, I would give you all of my volume. I'm talking about buying like 300 coins a month!

It is extremely difficult to pull off a double spend because the network propagation is insanely quick. By the time the merchant sees the transaction, it has already populated through a majority of nodes, and a double spend attempt would be rejected. Even if you could get another transaction to broadcast, it would also have to be accepted with no confirmations. 
As for a 51%, ASICs are far to prevalent. It would easily cost more to perform the attack than the entire market cap, and you still run into the problem that while you are preparing for the attack there are half a dozen other companies also cranking out ASICs, and they have several months/years advantage on you. 
@_date: 2013-07-25 16:10:06

I made a similar offer about five months ago, 0.1 BTC to anyone who would do some research on the topic and ask questions. No takers. The last couple weeks I gave out 0.01 to a couple of people, word got out, and I was swarmed with requests. I have since dropped down to whatever $5 is on Coinbase. Most people know I have made a considerable amount of money, so they are interested in holding, and even setting up small recurring buys. I really don't care what they do with it, if they want to buy a Gyft card or whatever, at least they will see how easy it is to spend BTC.

That doesn't change the fact that your definition of a currency is absolutely arbitrary. You can go to nearly every country in the world and find a few vendors that accept Bitcoin, and it meets the dictionary definition as a currency, yet you flatly refuse to recognize that. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 21:36:16
Yes. The Blockchain simply tracks who has what, it doesnt track how they got it, or if they should have it. So if someone steals your coins and moves them, then everyone can see that they moved. They dont have anyway of knowing if you really moved them, or if they were stolen, nor do they want to. 
Why do I say they dont want to? Because EVERYONE has to keep track of this. Do I really care if you bought a pair of alpaca socks? Not really, I just care that the coins you once owned now belong to the seller of the socks, that way when the seller of the socks tries to give them to me to buy a tshirt, I know that they actually have the coins they are trying to send to me. Look at it this way, Bitcoins are the digital equivelant of cash. We dont write on the back of a $20 bill every time it is spent, we just validate that it is real, then we accept it. The blockchain simply validates that the coins are real, so you can accept it. 
Not a perfect analogy, but it is a little bit different than others have phrased it, hopefully that will help someone.

I can proudly say that she can swipe private keys into a Blockchain mobile wallet, she knows that my paper wallets are in my safe deposit box at a specific branch. She also knows about 2FA, and that she needs to make sure she secures my phone. I made sure that I have a written account of all of my wallets, and sites that I use. 
I'm glad it all worked out for you, and I know you forced several of us to evaluate our situation. I know I didn't have enough documented for my wife to recover everything.

It is, and they are working on that. For now though, there is no reason to be paying 5x what you should be paying. And for what it is worth, I frequently do 0.00001 and still get a confirmation on the second or third block. If you dont need to be in the next block, just use a smaller amount.

Not one thing in your store is priced competitively. Several US and Canada suppliers are providing the same miners at slightly more than half the cost. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 15:29:33
Personally I dont think buyers should be able to use merchants as a hedge against BTC prices. If the price rises, expect the same dollar amount back. If the price falls, expect the same BTC amount back. If the merchant converts to fiat immediately, at the merchants discretion they could offer the dollar amount back via a different method. Basically in no situation should the merchant be expected to provide MORE BTC back than was originally given.

By the time you pay escrow fees, Coinbase's fees, factor in time and gas for picking up Western Union payments (and dealing with the 1-3 fraudulent payments per day), the prices are what they are. Im very slowly working my prices down, and trying to buy larger amounts on CampBX when prices are low, so I can move my price lower to market rate, but they are never going to be market rate, because there is time involved. If I wanted to sell coins at market rate, I would sell them on an exchange. Locally you probably can get them closer to true market rate, since there is less fraud, no escrow fees, and you can typically meet up with someone in less time than it takes to wait in line and fill out a Western Union sheet. 
By all means, if you have no reason to need them anonymously, then buying them on Coinbase or CampBX is definitely the easiest and cheapest way, especially if you have Level 2 on Coinbase.

I doubt this halving will be as big as the last, because I think the mining situation has changed significantly. Consider this, at the last halving, a lot of miners were still individuals, these individuals largely believed in bitcoin and were holding more of it, and spending what they didnt. Since mining revenues dropped significantly, these users then took to buying. 
At the next halving, a lot of the miners (if not most) will be commercial entities. These commercial entities will likely not be buying bitcoin to supplement the bitcoin they arent mining, and I dont think the amount of hobbyist miners left will be sufficient to drive the price up.

This is not the case. The government has already repeatedly acknowledged that bitcoin is "money". Furthermore, it doesnt matter how you pay for an illegal item, it is still illegal. Barter doesnt exempt you from laws, if you are trading two donkeys and a chicken for some meth, that does not change the fact that you bought meth, and it doesnt make donkeys and chickens a currency.

There is also a Constitutional argument. In the past when gold had been banned, we didn't have near the civil interest groups that we have today. If the US Government tries to flat out ban digital currency, the ACLU, EFF and the Bitcoin Foundation would all likely file First Amendment complaints, suggesting that the ban of alternate currency is an infringement on freedom of expression. 
Personally, this doesn't worth me. It would be impossible to enforce, and it couldn't last. The rest of the network would survive, and eventually we would get things corrected in the US. Also, don't ignore that the more US citizens using it, the more difficult it will be to "get rid of". 
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:51:02

For processors, that could be part of the service the render. They would have to understand how to minimize the risk (super connected nodes, maybe a system to "hold" transactions that don't have a fee or don't meet the network's current standard for quick acceptance). That may be one way to address it. 
This is one of the biggest unknowns. We know that double spends can happen. We have vendors in the wild. What we don't have is a bunch of dishonest people actively trying to rip the vendors off. This is what we need to know how much of a risk double spends are. Once we know the real world risk, we can figure out how to solve it. Perhaps the easiest solution is getting the miners to be "honest" and accept the first transaction with the minimum fee, even if a transaction with a larger fee comes along later. I don't really know.

You are covered, the system is pretty fair. If you have local sellers, that is the best way, because you can actually build a relationship with your seller (I charge my locals less, cut them cool deals, and often give them free bitcoin related trinkets when I can), but if their pricing is insane, by all means, go online! Just remember, Western Union and MoneyGram have fees associated with them, and unless the sellers specifies in their ad, you are responsible for ALL of the fees.

This isnt like walking down the road and finding $100, this is like walking down the road behind someone carrying a bag of money with a hole it, and instead of trying to give you back, you just grab every bill as it falls out, then dash off.

Just because they have more money than you is not justification. $1500 is not chump change, you should have at least made a goodwill attempt to return it, but instead it sounds like you already wasted it all.

I suspect if the error is on their side, they will cover it. Hasn't ever happened to me, and frankly, I'm not sure it has happened to them at all. They don't have a large amount of volume, which makes them a smaller target for fraud.

The recent jump has really intrigued my parents. I gave my mom 1btc in August, and it blew their mind that it is worth double now. My mom had been planning on spending it on some things here and there, buying Gyft cards to spend it. Now she is hoping she can use it to pay for a cruise for their 50th anniversary in five years. 
Everyone who actually knows me immediately asks me what the bitcoin price is, even if they have no other interest in it. This is a great time, because people have just heard about it, and more and more will get in on it. Critical mass, as it were.

It makes very little sense that they would refuse to honor prices that were in true error, but honor prices that were the result of market manipulation.

I was selling coins on Bitstamp in $1 increments for about $20 less than asking prices. These orders would indeed execute, Im guessing they executed for the people with the highest "buy" bids first, but Im not certain. They did execute at the price I was placing them at though. If I placed enough of these, eventually it would carry through to Coinbase's pricing structure and cause Coinbase's price to tank.

Stable is a relative term, obviously. Im more referring to the point where we can all stop checking the price every three minutes to make sure that something big isnt happening.

CampBX, Bitstamp, Coinbase, LocalBitcoins
In that order. LocalBitcoins will be the fastest method, followed by Coinbase. If you dont care about fast, then CampBX will likely offer you the cheapest coins, and Bitstamp will be the best representation of the overall market. Most of the time CampBX will be the cheapest place to buy them, but every now and then something weird will be going on, and they have low volume so it will be exaggerated. I would avoid Mt Gox because the prices are high (you can buy on LocalBitcoins for less) and I wouldnt bother with BTC-E because it seems to be relatively shady (operated by unknown Russians).

Yes to the first part, I sold small amounts on Bitstamp below market, then bought large amounts at that price on Coinbase. Coinbase is not a traditional exchange, they pull their prices from Bitstamp, and then presumably rely on being able to buy the coins they just sold you from Bitstamp. The problem was, those small orders I was placing below market were coming through and getting factored into Coinbase's pricing, causing it to fall dramatically, which then allowed me and anyone else who was quick enough, the ability to buy coins at $20 below market.

Its still early. Throw some spare cash at it, secure your wallet and back it up, then wait. If you are worried about it, dont throw a whole lot at it. If you are looking at it as an investment, just remember it is a long term investment. If the market crashes, dont freak out. It will likely still recover (unless it crashes way, way down). On the same token, decide where you want to be. If a good rally gets going, are you going to sell, or are you going to wait to see if it goes higher?

I like this more than I do Snap, and possibly as much as Gyft. The biggest issue is still going to be the fee though. I dont use Snap because their fee is excessive, and I didnt really start using Gyft until they added rewards points. Im not struggling, so I can afford to pay using the cheapest method and simply exchange Bitcoins to fiat later to pay myself back. In the case of Gyft, that is cheaper than fiat! Snap, no. 
If your extension can give a fair market value for my bitcoin, I would use it in a heartbeat, since I wouldnt have to deal with buying "clean" amounts of Gyft card. If you are going to offer a huge fee, no dice.

Everyone is telling you to keep it, I'm going to tell you something completely different. 
Have a conversation with your son, and do some research together. If this is his money, and he understands the risks and is willing to wait, then by all means, let it ride. If this is money that was given to him, or he is expected to buy a car with, sell them immediately. He can register with Coinbase and have cash in his bank account within a few days, or he can open an account on CampBX and sell them quickly as well. 
This is a learning experience for both of you. This is a chance to teach him about investing, regardless of what you do, and this is a chance for the two of you to learn about Bitcoin. Whatever you do, remember he is old enough to make his own choices, and don't belittle him for being interested in investing. You dont want to put him off of it, because it is very important for kids his age to start early.

Precisely, and to put what you said in other words, this helps with confidence. Confidence from speculators, confidence from merchants that it is stable enough to hold to some extent, and most importantly, confidence from users that their value won't tank, therefore making them more likely to hold larger amounts for longer periods of time before spending them. All in all, very good things for the future.

I wouldnt say I am over my head, but I am invested heavier than I should be, and I will freely admit that. It is a calculated risk. Im young, it will be at least 40 years before I retire. I have a pretty well balanced portfolio through my employer and personal retirement accounts. I have adequate savings in USD, and I have also converted some of that savings to BTC with the intention that I would sell those coins first if I had an immediate emergency. 
I keep my BTC well secured, using a variety of accounts and using 2FA anywhere it is available. I have investments in bitcoin, ranging from some stocks to investments in mining equipment (that wont reach ROI, NEVER AGAIN!). 
I believe in Bitcoin, so being more heavily invested in it is my way of putting my money where my mouth is. If I am correct, I should do very well on my BTC investments. If Im not correct, I will still be okay. Not quite where I could have been, but still much better than most people my age.

How much would shipping cost though? I dont think you could use any of the standard carriers, since it would be to large (unless you are talking very small trees).

They probably already allocated coins to you. I have had three transactions clear today, and have received my coins for all of them.

Honestly, I dont know. I think it is best not to have some sort of expectation, anticipation, or dreams about where the value could go. I like Bitcoins on a fundamental basis, and I dont think they are going anywhere. Im reasonably confident that because of that, I wont lose money on them, and I enjoy participating in the niche culture that has sprung up around them. 
If they are worth $1000 in 10 years then I will be thrilled to no end. If they are worth $100 in 10 years, no big deal, because I will be spending them along the way regardless.

Common misconception, only small transactions are handled off Blockchain, everything else is done on Blockchain.

It is not.

If your purchase is not something illicit, and you are willing to share what you are buying, I will help you out.

What kind of bitcoins to gas scam are you running here? Why would I pay 40 mBTC for an empty Elantra? Do you think I am some kind of idiot? 
Im a reasonable man and I know Premium costs $3.29/gallon here. You should have about $42.25 worth of gas there, and I will offer a *very* generous rate of $1/mBTC, that puts us at 42.25 mBTC, but I understand your time is very valuable, so if you are willing to siphon the gas over to my car, I will pay you an additional 7.75 mBTC for your time. This puts us at 50 mBTC. To be quite honest, Im not all that interested in the gas tank you call an "Elantra", so I will happily return it to you so that you can better service your other customers. 
Are you willing to escrow? I am willing to release funds as soon as I know your Elantra hasnt tainted my gas. Please send me a PM ASAP so we can work out the details. Thanks!

What? Coinbase doesn't create Bitcoins, it purchases them, then sells them. It simply isn't possible for them to just create Bitcoins at whim.

Am I a terrible person for thinking we should use this to get Ghash.io shutdown and even out mining pools a bit? 
@_date: 2013-11-14 13:07:36
Jeeze, is behind on things. I posted about this a week ago! 
@_date: 2013-09-20 20:35:57
Heh, imagine that! I havent done a whole lot of research on P2P mining. Its cool that already exists. Since Im already not going to make ROI, I think Im going to switch over to P2Pool this weekend. I have been thinking about it for a few weeks, since at this point Im not trying to mine a consistent return, and I know I wont make ROI, so Im not to concerned about variance.

QuickPay is still slow if the receiver doesnt have a Chase account. Also, if the receiver has had questionable account sending in the past, they place a hold on the funds until it clears the senders account (24-48 hours). Unfortunately I know this from experience, as I use QuickPay to send money to a family member who has had some financial hardship in the past. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 09:03:30
Largely dependent on your bank, I suppose. I use Chase and they have never blinked, even at a recent $10k ACH to Coinbase. Kinda funny they will flag a $600 charge to Verizon when ordering a new phone, but have no problem with literally my entire account balance being used in one transaction. I hate banks. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 16:55:43
Coinbase is definitely the easiest way. LocalBitcoins is a good option as well, if you are privacy conscious. 
@_date: 2013-10-17 23:01:24
That chart is my absolute favorite.

I disagree, I had a credit card stolen, and the amount charged was much less than $700, and the police still investigated it, got CCTV from where it was used, and ultimately filed charges against the woman that stole it from me. Keep in mind, this wasnt someone I knew, this was a waitress who decided not to give me my card back, and then used it when I didnt notice that I hadnt received it back.
I think the police would be interested in a $700 scam, especially when the scammer is threatening the victim with police reports.

More control, more security. Paper wallets are good because they can be completely offline, which protects them in the event your computer is ever compromised. They also make it more difficult to spend or panic sell, if you are trying to keep them long term. Coinbase with 2FA is probably fine for smaller amounts, or for "spending" money. If you are going to keep a large amount of funds, but still want quick access, I would recommend a desktop client like Multibit or Electrum (I use Electrum).
