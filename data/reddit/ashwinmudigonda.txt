Thanks. Yes, I figured the first part.
But regarding the second part, isn't holding the CC info a way for Netflix to guarantee that you'll pay up? If it's one-ended then how can Netflix recover the cost of a subscriber who uses the product, and fails to pay?
And finally, what if (this is a joke, I know) but what if CC companies in the US (I hear they are proactive in Europe and elsewhere) decide that security is worth the investment and massively overhaul their network to use chips. Or, if something like google wallet takes off once Apple introduces NFC chips?

Yup! Don't buy Apple or its stocks. That's all it takes.

While a noble gesture, I doubt if it will have the reach you are looking for. It still might be a good starting point.

Hi. This is a nice idea, but what I really would like to see in any of these apps is a way to see the "value" of "my" portfolio. It would be nice to have a tab or a section where I can put in my 1.356 BTC and see what its value is.

Casher: Sir, an excellent choice. So you are buying the tweed jacket?
Customer: Yes, I'm paying with  my bitcoins, please.
Cashier: Very well, sir. The total is...8.12 coins. If you could initiate the transfer.
Customer: Hang on. The price dropped.
Cashier: &lt;titters into a silk handkerchief&gt; Indeed, sir. It happens all the time. If you wait, maybe...
Customer: Fuck! It dropped 10%. 
Cashier: &lt;clears throat&gt; If you'd like to return...
Customer: Holy smokes! Another 5%. This is a great deal, eh, old chum?
Cashier: I'll be in that corner, polishing my mustache if you need me.
Customer: Went up 2%. Okay I sent it.

I understand this attitude. I bore it too when I met him. But the point is that the world is not all tech savvy like us. There are people who still don't know how to silence their smartphones or uninstall an app. You can't blame them when they fall for something like this.
This is not a problem for you and me, but it is, and will be, for millions of others. Your own elderly relatives might be hit with something like this one day, and you'll have to grit your teeth and accept it.

I was pool mining using teamcoinye and today they shut down abruptly. I have a thousand or so coinye coins now. Not sure what to do with them, though.

Again, you are missing my point. I did question him about how this happened, and he admitted to clicking a link. He asked me what he should do to prevent this, and I told him the same thing - be smarter and don't click on shit bait.
But this is independent of the thread that bitcoin can be used for malicious purposes. Yes, everything can be used for malicious purposes. But we are not talking about everything here. Bitcoin, for all its strengths, has its weaknesses. People are going to fall for this even if we run a federally funded PSA for years.
You and I get bitcoin and other tech stuff. Millions don't, and that's my point. You and I know bitcoin is not the issue here, but stupidity. Well, try explaining global warming to a seventy year old Floridian republican. If you want to sell bitcoin to the public, all I am saying is that this is an issue.

It's OP's way of endearing to the community. It's the equivalent of a new dog approaching a pack with its tail down.
@_date: 2014-06-06 17:40:56
I think that stand across the road looks nice. It has tasty dogs. What's it called again? Hot Dogs Plus? Sounds good.

Will do. Doing that crashed my doge client! but i got the gist of it! thanks.
@_date: 2014-06-06 16:01:02
I understand your sentiment, but the fact is that dollars = money paradigm has existed in people's mind for a century or more for now. That BTC = value = money is very radical. You and I get it. But millions don't. And I gave this experience with my friend to showcase how the layman can **also** perceive bitcoin.
It does nothing to sling ad hominems at me or him. This could happen to your own folks too.

I use Android.

I sure as hell hope not that Apple is coming up with AppleCoins!

While a great idea, it should be known that cricket is a cash-rich sport in India. Too rich for most people. So rich that the nation's national sport - field hockey - is barely given enough importance.
Point is: the big guys don't need the money. It's the little guys. Cricket is played at levels - from one's backyard to one's nation. Pick something at the state level, and you might have the best luck.

Rarely do two opposing groups instantly start a fight. It takes two hands to clap. One is always the oppressor. For way too long until the other snaps.
@_date: 2014-01-14 19:14:56
Actually I did that. I have some dogecoins. I backed it up locally and on my dropbox to a .dat file. And coinye! :D
How do I make sure it's encrypted? The client only has a backup option.
@_date: 2013-04-11 06:16:32
Thanks a bunch.
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:55:37
Ok. Thanks.
@_date: 2013-08-23 01:28:28
Oh! It is exactly like that here. Only after you are done, there is a 40$ fee added to it.
I had to wire money to India and someone suggested a new web site to try. For a flat fee of 2.99$ I could transfer up to 10,000$ per day. Easy peasy. Only catch was that they were offering a good 2 rupees lower than the current market value. So I thought of using my bank Chase. When I saw the 40$ fee, I spat my coffee. And I will never again think about them again ever. They just lost my business with this product even though I have banked with them for a long time.

That sub gave me the chills. For once, I had to turn off my "let me be an asshole" mode off.
@_date: 2013-04-11 06:15:23
Thank you.

Well wouldn't you first deposit in another exchange, say, CampBX. Transfer to Mt. Gox, and then withdraw there?

Does this work on Windows as your screenshot shows? I am running python2.6 on Win 7 and all I see is appended text like this:
@_date: 2013-05-21 15:36:36
Thanks. I knew it should be simple, but boy that is real easy! thanks again.
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:53:20
Ah! But not impossible, right? It's just time delayed? 
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:04:17
I am not, but my friend was curious. I was trying to explain to him why **all** the internet exchanges didn't hit a 1000$ per coin, and he refused to believe it. When I showed it to him, he asked me this question and I didn't have an answer. He said this is called arbitrage in stock market terms, and that it should not happen.
@_date: 2013-05-21 15:36:42
Thank you!
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:52:43
Hypothetically, to make money. I buy 962$ on CampBx. Transfer to MtGox. Sell it at 1062$. I make a 100$ theoretically. Maybe 75$ or so after fees. But it's still a guaranteed profit if there is always that price difference independent of the cost of the coin. Am i missing something here if my motive is to gain fiat?
@_date: 2013-04-11 06:14:51
Thank you.
