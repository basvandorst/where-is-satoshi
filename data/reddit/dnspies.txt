But that just says how much they got, not who didn't pay.  In any case it's a psychological thing.  You stop to watch a juggling show and then before the last trick he goes into a long speil about "This is how I make a living, if you enjoyed the show please give put something in the hat etc.  If you can't afford to give me something right now then at least come up and talk to me.  Don't just walk away."
But with the Bitcoin sign, people can just take a snapshot and walk away saying to themselves "I'll do it later" and then promptly forget about it.

For street performers it's a mixed bag, because people can claim they donated when really they only gave 50 cents or something.  Presently, I'd guess the whole "I know if you leave without paying" bit tends to work pretty well in practice.  And of course it falls apart if everyone knows they don't know

Technically speaking, cracking RSA isn't good enough.  You actually need to factor the public key to claim this one (which is generally thought to be harder)
