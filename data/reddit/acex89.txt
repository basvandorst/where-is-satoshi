Triggered by the promise of coin

 I'm asking her to give me some real proof of her position or to give me payouts before i give she money again, or a refund, promising to reinvest all but she claims to work for blockchain and that she do not have access to my money or payouts bc they are to the miners nob and payouts comes after 60 days.
Of course I will not give a penny more to she I'm just trying (and I now know that I will fail) to obtain my money back. 
Oh well, lession learned

In the beginning she said to me that after the first investment I shall make one or two more. I made the second and I'm the beginning she agreed that it was enough, but later she said that I have to make the third one before obtaining payouts. Don't really want to send her more money

I should have informed myself before instead of judging her veridicity based only on her instagram account. My fault, my losses. This It's the price to pay to acting so stupid.

lol I wish I was trolling dude ok I'm an idiot for not have informed myself before. 
At a first look her profile was real, I had to dig out the shit from it by myself and then I ask reddit help for confirmation. I'm just thinking different and learned a lession I didn't want to learn in a bad way. Thanks for the answet then

Yeah, thanks for the support, there's no way I'm making a mistake like this again

No way, impossible to have money back, here's a part of the conv we had: 
Me " I was thinking it was less expensive the whole thing in the beginning, I would be happy to obtain less and then reinvest or even a refund. Which kind of warranty your company offer to.investors? And which company do.you work for?"
Her "That’s the plan and all of it need to be completed I explained earlier, I work for blockchain company. Over the years and I have a good name with them and trust worthy."
Me " Yeah and you shall give investors some warranty or an escrow or something? Bc I'm litterally send money to someone I don't really know, based on your profile you seems to tell the truth this is why I got interested but I really need some real proofs of all this thing, so the only things for me to totally belive that you're right is that you will give me my payouts or at least a refund, then I will reinvest for sure"
Her "Your payouts are �� guaranteed the deal you are doing is for just 60 days which your payouts would soon be soon like in about 20 days, 
And you need to complete the payment before then. So it’s all you choice so we don’t have issues and delay on your payouts. After this reinvestment we are all good 
And your payouts would be released at 60 days times you know"
Me " Yeah answer first my questions. I only need some serious proofs or warranty from you. I will make a third reinvestment if you can show me your veridicity sending a first payout to my wallet from profits made by my actual investment, and thats all, Then we'll not have any issue"
Her "I don’t have any access to your payouts, You know it’s on the miners and would be sent out in 60 days, What are you talking about we discussed this earlier and now you are acting like you don’t understand, You payouts are guaranteed"
Me " yeah and in which way they are guaranteed?"
Her " Because blockchain is the most trusted network:  "
Me " Yeah but you only claim to be with blockchain I don't really know you so it's natural to be a bit sceptical, So I only ask for a proof about your buiseness in some way, The best way is to give me some payouts before i made a re investment. I'm sure you can find some way to prove your position. If not I'm sorry but I'm asking a refund.  If you really work for that company you shall have refund policy and I demand it now if you can't proof yourself in some way, thats all"
Her "You know I won’t indulge myself in such arguments never So right now I don’t understand what you are talking about You would get your payouts In 60 days trust me and you can decide to do more"
Me "U dont act too much professional, I'll trust you if you first start answering my questions, as money are involved, and you work for a company, you should ensure trasparency to us investors, And second if you prove me that you are willing to give me payouts, if you send me even a small amount of the interest I'll surely make buiseness with you and even invite friends, it will be a shame not to do it"
Her "When it’s 60 days and your payouts are locked then you would know why you are doing all of this"
Me "Why you just don't answer my simple questions, seems lecit"
Her "Because even before we started your investment I already explained all to you
You can’t keep stressing me for the little money you are investing you know 
I have investors that investors over $100k even companies and I don’t get stressed this way 
This is the system and I have been investing over the years and none of my investors had made any losses"
Me "Sorry but I've should informed myself on you before start investing, to me you're 99% scam so I'm not sending any money to you if you dont prove me I'm wrong and the only way is to give back my  0.02 immediately"
Her "When it’s 60 days let’s talk, When you see your payouts and it’s non-spendable then you would understand me, I have nothing to do with your money you are just been skeptical"
Me "I am, so just prove me I'm wrong it will not be difficult"
Her "You would see in 60 days"
Me "I want to see it now"
Her "Okay Because I would request for your email by then and your payouts would be generated, That’s just it. Your payouts is guaranteed"
I'm posting for awareness. Now I understand, those scammers scam people use psychology to convince you to trust them without any proofs by their site. This is taking advantage of people like me and many others that are new to cryptocurrency. They don't contact you, your stupidity will contact them.
I feel so dumb! Thanks to the many users answering me I think I also deserve to be a little offended bc I'm an idiot to be scammed like this..  What a shame.
