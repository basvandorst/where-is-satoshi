Yep, most McDonalds in the US have NFC payment terminals now.

I'd be willing to bet that American bitcoin users are more likely to have a passport than the average American.

"Costs" has a specific legal meaning and generally does not include attorney's fees. It means court costs, like filing fees, duplication charges, etc.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe there's no way to send a payment person-to-person with a Japanese IC card. That's a huge disadvantage compared to cash/PayPal/bitcoin.

Google just sold Moto to Lenovo. The Moto X is still a good phone though.

Titanium Backup has an encryption option you can enable for your backed up data.

Also, he's just 1 member of the House of Representatives, and a member of the minority party. He basically has no power to do anything of substance.

Yep, the rates at Narita are actually quite reasonable.

Unfortunately almost every brokerage in NYC is horrible.

No one is found innocent in a criminal trial. They are found not guilty. Legally that's quite significant.

That's a regular accounting term.

I believe Chexsystems is only for reporting people who owe banks money (such as when you overdraft an account). Simply closing your account for buying bitcoins shouldn't be reported there.

It looks like he's not accepting bitcoins, bitpay is, so only bitpay needs the license since they are the payment processor.

I believe Japan doesn't have plea bargains.

He's in federal custody. There is no way he's getting anywhere near a smartphone. (remember the feds considered him so much of a threat that they refused to give him advanced notice of the witnesses against him at his trial)

Poisoned apples are bad because when you buy an apple, you expect it to be food. You can sell poison if you label it as poison (insecticides, etc)

Even if that's true, does that mean as soon as a 'smaller' company begins to threaten coinbase's revenue, the patent arsenal will be launched at the competition? Not exactly good for a competitive marketplace.

Any competent lawyer should have a contingency plan for his own death. (i.e. another lawyer who would take over his files)

You'd still owe federal taxes, and most states treat capital gains as ordinary income for state tax purposes.

Maybe he was attempting to "hide in plain sight" ala Gus Fring.

In theory they should have to hold a public auction for it once it is formally forfeited.

That's not really possible on iOS devices without jailbreaking, unfortunately. 
@_date: 2013-09-12 00:35:46
Custom ROM like CyanogenMod can do it. CM has a feature called PrivacyGuard which restricts apps access to your data.

Last time I checked, the E*Trade app doesn't make me buy stocks through Apple, and Apple doesn't get a 30% cut when I buy stock. Bitcoins should be treated no different.

Apple uses a cryptographic signature on all apps to restrict what the device can run. However I think people have occasionally found loopholes in the system. I'm not sure if the latest iOS is vulnerable though.
