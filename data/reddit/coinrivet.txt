It will be interesting to see if Gwyneth Paltrow will continue to support Bitcoin when there is plenty of news regarding the environmental issues that can arise from mining. We shall have to see whether this is a one off or whether she will continue to contribute to the community.

Perhaps you are correct but until this argument can be formulated in a cohesive manner by those involved in Bitcoin then we would expect for the energy consumption argument to continue to gain traction

It could become even more volatile and reach dizzying heights of $6,500 by 2020.

Hopefully articles such as the below can gain some more traction to combat the environmental argument being pushed by certain sections of the media academia.

I did make a mistake it was Stephen Baldwin, not Alec. But, for the most part I was right

I like Max and his evangelism for BTC. However, on Keiser Report and on Twitter he shilled Maxcoin and Startcoin. He did a marketing campaign for Dash where he drove around the country (with Alec Baldwin I think - I could be wrong). I have no doubt he believes in BTC and is somewhat of a BTC maximalist but for him to say "leave alts to dickheads like Jamie Dimon" is a bit rich

That's the kind of productive discussion I like to see.

I think that is a fair question. From those I have spoken to in the industry many of these companies do see the possibility of making money from the crypto industry. I think with the power and influence they have they could convince the CFTC to push this through. Of course, I could be wrong but there does seem be an appetite for it
