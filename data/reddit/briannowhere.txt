Look at all the triggered right wing nutjobs coming out from under their rocks. No one on the left barely knows who he is but he gives money to democrats so he's a demon. Of course the Koch bros and Mercers are just peachy to their diseased, racist brains.
Oh and Nancy Pelosi is a competent minority leader who instills fear in her opponents that's why they demonize her too. Hillary Cinton is a washed up and out of touch sure, but nowhere near as bad a person as right wing lunatics make her out to be.
These are facts. Right wingers are now like lizard people. No facts, no sense and no intellectual honesty or credibility. 
Even David Frum, Bill Kristol and George Will have joined forces with the "left" ie: sane Americans, against the madness. You will be defeated. Your boy Trump is a traitor and will probably go to jail soon At the very least he'll be run out of office on a rail by us sane citizens. The day of reckoning is coming.

The internet itself is a good comparison. You also can to look at other disruptive technologies throughout history. Things take a long time to develop and I never claimed that this can't all lead to nothing or even to bad things. I believe it will either explode and change everything in a big way of fizzle out completely. Not much room for middle ground. 
You strike me as just another person who didn't buy when they should have and are now hoping for it to fail so you don't have to eel like you missed out. There's a lot of you folks out there.

I think people are still thinking too short term and generally don't get what a long term deal this all is. Bitcoin will eventually become less volatile, once the price achieves it's full potential, probably somewhere around 1MM per bitcoin. Once this happens it will be much more stable and will fluctuate much less. Hardly anyone will own a full bitcoin, much less several. 
This won't happen for another 5-10 or even 20 years, at which point the hope is the scaling issues and transaction speed problems will have been ironed out. By then, Bitcoin will be a common form of currency. A whole new economy will have formed around crypto and there will be several different accepted forms (like how now we have Visa, Mastercard, Discover) will revolutionize industry. Block-chain tech will revolutionize modern industry and countries will issue their own forms of crypto. Other things will happen that no one can possibly predict. This could include an event (like quantum computers) that bring the whole thing crashing down, so don't get me wrong there's still huge risk.
Like most things, there will probably be several events over this period that come a long to shake the system and many will sell. Perhaps quantum computers will threaten the system, perhaps governments will ban. If these kinds of events happen and bitcoin manages to bounce back again (perhaps a developer will use quantum technology to make bitcoin stronger)  people will mourn their stupidity and impatience. 
In the end it 1 bitcoin will either be worth a million or more, or it will go away completely. 
In the meantime, enjoy the ride. This is still the ground floor.

A guess is like flipping a coin. An educated guess is looking at circumstances, using your experience of past events and applying them to the future. It has nothing to do with credentials. The school of hard knocks and many years of actually living in the world is far superior to school. That's why any job you apply for asks you if you have experience. An education by itself doesn't get you much and doesn't teach you much. You learn by doing and I've learned enough to know that you don't know what you are talking about.

It's not on anyone's radar really. You are arguing about shit from 20 years ago. 
But since you asked, I do believe that slavery was wrong and that it's effects reverberate on black families to this day. Black people do not have the generational wealth that white people have because civil rights weren't enacted til the 60's.  I think we as a society can and should do things to help black families get ahead in the world because that's called leveling the playing field. 
What liberals DO NOT believe is that all money should be distributed equally or that there should not be rich people. The problem as we see it is that the rich have disproportionately too much power and should not be allowed to continue sucking up practically ALL the wealth, leaving little to nothing to the middle class and poor, turning us into serfs and peons in their fiefdoms, which is what will happen if we don't reign in their power.
We believe the rich get rich via the sweat of our labor and we'll be goddamned if we let them turn us into their slaves as a wy to return the favor.

I've been experimenting with ripple and quite like it. The transactions are instant and there's no worries about 51% attack etc.  You can trade many different kinds of coins using it including some that are available only through ripple. 
People will say, Oh it's premined and centralized but I really fail to see why that's such a bad thing. It does the things that bitcoin is supposed to do but does them better. 
I like BTC and am long term bullish but think that Ripple has some potential to either be something that works well with bitcoin OR could just overcome bitcoin in the future if the BTC people don;t fix some of the issues.

The double taxation argument doesn't fly. Income is income and it's taxable. By your logic if I take my paycheck and start a business with it, I shouldn't have to pay taxes on the money the business makes. 
But back to your point, your original investment is NOT taxed and is deductible. If you lose money or break even you don't have to pay new taxes. The tax you pay is on the gains. 
Income= Money that comes in. 
As to the original question, hard to say but most people don't get audited and can get away with a certain amount of small untaxed purchases, just like not paying sales tax for things you buy online. If you do this too much and get audited though, you'll wish you had just paid.

Ripple has an agreement with something called Snap-Swap that has physical locations all over the country, usually located at currency exchange type stores. 
If you get a Ripple account, you can go to a Snap-Swap and purchase XRP which you can then trade for Bitcoins on Bitstamp (Bitstamp is Ripple friendly) and once you have Bitcoins there are tons of places to trade them for other alt coins. 
Snap-Swap does take a cut, something like 4% of what you buy. Coinbase has a 1% fee + the bank charges $0.15. for every purchase.  Coinbase is still the best way to get BTC with USD in the US. However if you aren't verified on coinbase yet Snap-Swap could be a good way to get your hands on BTC using USD.

NXT, Ripple, Peercoin and other Proof Of Stake coins offer something completely different.
Bitcoin and it's clones require mining to go on infinitely. Not only does this require an immense energy output, ff the miners ever stopped mining the coin and the network dies. In the future when all the bitcoins are created miners will have to make do with transaction fees. 
NXT, Peercoin and Ripple went another route by "pre-mining" and distributing a certain amount of coins. You'll hear people pooh-pooh this as being too centralized but when you think about it they are no more centralized than bitcoin and the early adopter phenomenon, where the first ones in reap the most rewards. 
By separating coin creation from transaction fees, Proof Of Stake eliminates the need to continue mining forever. It makes the transaction times faster as well as many-fold more energy efficient. The people who rip on pre-mined coins are usually doing so because they are bitcoin ideologues or miners who see a threat to their way of life. 
I recommend all bitcoin users to get a Ripple account to play with XRP to see just how much better pre-mined coins work. You can also "mine" for XRP by signing up for the world community grid and using your computer to help cure cancer, aids and other diseases. They are giving away hundreds of thousands of XRP to people who do this. I got 50 XRP my 1st week for hooking up two computers, the 1st of which is a Windows XP machine I hardly use, the second of which is my main computer which only runs the program as a screensaver when I get up from the computer. 
Sending XRP to another person takes literally seconds. No waiting for confirmations, no chargebacks, no lost coins, no double-spending. It just works. Right now Ripple is the only coin that presents an easy to use experience for average consumers. You can go to a currency exchange near your house and deposit or withdraw money using Zip-Zap/Snap Swap. It also has decentralized exchanges and allows you to leverage different exchange accounts against each other. Trust-Lines alllow for lots of interesting possibilities, allowing different coins to be created on top of Ripple, similar to the colored coins concept. XRP is the trustless element that ties it all together. 
Fast on Ripple's heels is NXT, which while still under development has some promising features such as "transparent forging" that will allow Ripple like transaction times as well as offering decentralized exchanges, aliasing, messaging, asset exchange (colored coins) etc. 
NXT and Ripple have both gone unaffected by Bitcoin's recent problems. Ripple's XRP price has also been rising slowly and steadily with very little volatility &amp; fluctuates much like a real currency does. NXT was only launched in January and it's price is tied to BTC so it's still too early to tell about it's volatility. 
If the playoffs ended today Ripple would win the game.

I think the only practical way to handle bitcoin as it is currently is to do the conversion from your country's currency to bitcoin at the time of payment. 
So say they owe you $300 USD, they can pay you  $300 USD or pay you $300 worth of Bitcoin, which you can either convert immediately back to $300 USD (via bitpay or similar) or hold in BTC.
If you quote them a flat BTC price and then let time go by, the customer will have an incentive to wait to pay you til BTC price is optimal for them (and not optimal for you).

I'm bullish on bitcoin but I don't think it will be useful for real world transactions all that much. Bitcoin shines as "money for the internet" and is very useful for things on the internet where a shipping address is not required: ie: software downloads, streaming content, access to information, etc.  
I think all the people who think bitcoin will replace currency are deluding themselves. For many purchases the 3% fee added to CC or paypal purchases is money well spent for the added protection. For other purchases where those things aren't needed or wanted, Bitcoin is a great solution. Online newspapers should be embracing this technology with both arms (looking at you Krugman).

I'm growing very bullish on NXT. 
I've been reading the whitepaper and installed the client and am very impressed. Not only does NXT offer the same potential for decentralized exchanges, colored coins, DNS, messaging, etc as Etherum and Mastercoin do, it solves many problems inherent in POW coins such as 51% attack vulnerability and slow transaction times.  It's also so much more energy friendly and not such a wasteful drain of electricity. It's the one coin out there right now that really offers something different than bitcoin style coins. 
POW fans decry pre-mined, but I fail to see what's wrong with the concept unless you are someone who invested tons of money of ASICs and just don't like a coin that can be forged by anyone on a Rasberry PI. 
@_date: 2014-02-05 04:10:44
Exactly. I have yet to see a cogent argument regarding why pre-mining is so bad. I recommend any bitcoiner to get a Ripple account and play around with XRP. 
The difference in how much faster the transaction times are in Ripple is remarkable. Coins transfer instantly without all the confirmation nonsense. It's also amazing how you can hook it up to different exchanges and use features from each. 
For instance I can trade XNF from noFiatcoin with USD even though NoFiatCoin is not able to handle USD. I can leverage my ability to trade USD on Bitstamp to purchase XNF with dollars using Ripple as the bridge between the two. 
Don't get me wrong, I love Bitcoin, but experimenting with Ripple and NXT has been like getting a glimpse into where bitcoin can go. People can knock them but I recommend trying them before you do.

Once a coin is launched and out in the wild it makes no difference to users if the coin was pre-mined or not. Any coin you can own is pre-mined by definition. Half of bitcoin is pre-mined as we speak. It changes nothing about the utility. 
n the United States, a security is a tradable financial asset of any kind. Securities are broadly categorized into:
debt securities (e.g., banknotes, bonds and debentures), equity securities (e.g., common stocks), derivatives (e.g., forwards, futures, options, and swaps).

I've invested in bitcoins as a risk.

There are a lot of big legitimate industries that have shady origins. Gambling and Liquor were also 'interesting ideas' that were run by outlaws and people with shady practices til the governments figured out that some ideas or creations can't be stopped. You've still provided nothing as to how Bitcoin itself is corrupt, only some of the people surrounding it. That'd be like someone from the 40's saying bars that serve alcohol will never become popular because they're run by the likes of Al Capone.  


There's also a ton of people who go on pump and dump chat-rooms thinking they can effect the market by spreading 'bad news'. Who knows how many of these claims are true? It seems to me that when the claim appears to be real that w/ Coinbase at least, they are simply an overwhelmed small company trying to keep up and they always seem to resolve the issues eventually. I've personally had no issues at all with them and have used them quite a bit.
I'm sure some of the operations out there are total shams, taking advantage of the suckers. The gold rush was no different. The internet is still the wild wild west in a lot of ways and caveat emptor is a good rule to live by. Doesn't change the fact that the technology is groundbreaking and as a cryptocurrency,  Bitcoin has a head start on all the rest and infrastructure growing around it fueled by massive amounts of VC. Perhaps something else will surpass it, perhaps not and Bitcoin will be ubiquitous one day.

You're thinking like a speculator and not an early adopter. Word of mouth is going to play an important role in which technology becomes the defacto standard and as of right now bitcoin is getting tons of press. Litecoin is merely bitcoins red-headed step child and is mainly making it's gains as a result of bitcoins popularity. 
At the end of the day, litecoin could turn out to be the facebook to bitcoin's myspace but at this point that is as unknowable as predicting facebook's success would have been back in the day. For that reason I am also planning to buy some litecoins as a hedge.

It's funny how partisan this makes people. Some people just LOVE spreading bad news and others refuse to listen to it. 
That being said, I'm surprised at that governments have been treating bitcoin with legitimacy at all and not just trying to crush it outright. Good thing bitcoins are decentralized and can be used by people who want to use them regardless of what governments say, that is unless they ban it outright.
I think they and/or other virtual currencies will continue to grow despite what any government has to say about it.  
China also locks down their internet pretty tightly and blocks many websites, so I don't see how anyone is surprised by this, hopefully the price will go down so I can keep collecting them at better prices (and yes, I have used them as well, mainly for donations)

The reason I think volatility is not as much of an issue as people think it is are two-fold. For one, it is possible to accept bitcoins as payment and convert immediately into a currency of your choice in real-time as the transaction is made. Sites like coinbase.com will be an invaluable part of this process. (If coinbase.com ever goes public, buy buy buy.) 
Secondly, bitcoins were not created to provide for large financial transactions. For large purchases I believe people will still want the protections and institutional backing of the banking and credit card systems. 
Bitcoins were invented to create a way to facilitate small transactions over the internet, making the process of exchanging money digitally resemble the way it is transacted in the brick and mortar world. 
Once bitcoins become more ubiquitous, I believe most people will hold small amounts on their cell phones and hard drives and use them for small purchases on the internet. Suddenly it won't be so cumbersome to pay the equivalent of a quarter for some content you'd like access to. It will make buying music and movies easier than pirating and when the honest citizens stop expecting everything for free it will free up resources and make it more legitimate in the eyes of the internet community to go after real cyber criminals. 
What I see when I think about bitcoins is that missing piece the internet has long been needing to make it possible for commerce on the internet to be more like it is in the real world. No forms to fill out, not credit card information needed. 
Until bitcoins become stable, they can remain tied to an exchange until it can stand on it's own two feet. If most people use them for these types of small transactions there would be little fear of losing large sums to market fluctuations. 
tldr: bitcoins true value lies in it's ability to accommodate anonymous small transactions with the same ease as it is done in the physical world with coins and paper money. 
it solves a problem, and that is why I believe the sky is the limit.

When an author lets their bias shine so clearly right out of the starting gate, it's time to stop reading.

But the word "bit" is right there. It just seems like "bit" is the most logical choice. Seems confusing to describe things as things as Mega-X and Micro-X but then refer to the units that those things relate to as anything else except for X. If there's a Megabit, then it stands to reason there has to be a corresponding bit to go with that. 
If the smallest unit is a Satoshi, then call the larger units MicroSatoshis and MegaSatoshis. I don't see how it can go both ways. 
For such a mathematical and logical concept is seems very illogical and inconsistent to let emotions dictate the name of the smallest unit.

Please elaborate on how it's corrupted beyond repair. 
There's nothing in this life more annoying than people who make statements of certitude with no facts to back them up. 
I don't know what the future holds and neither do you.

The problem with most peoples thinking on this is in thinking so short term. I'm prepared to hold ten or twenty years if that's what it takes. Think about the difference in the internet from 1995 to 2013. Maybe Bitcoin is Webcrawler or Excite. Maybe it's Google or Apple. There's nothing corrupt about the technology though.

While reading the NYT article, at the bottom of the page it says "You have read 5 of 10 free articles this month." and asks me to "Try unlimited access for just 99¢". 
Imagine if there was a quick way I could pay for that subscription without having to provide my credit card information.

I Have had no problems at all with Coinbase. They are a fully registered business in San Francisco and they are being watched. They seem to me to be simply overwhelmed with fast growth and trying to keep up. They always seem to resolve the issue eventually, it's just that when people's money is in limbo they tend to freak out. 
There's also no way to know how many of the claims are actually legitimate and not just user error or outright lies by people who just have a visceral hatred of bitcoins and want to see them fail. 
The best thing to do is wade in slowly, learn what you are doing and how to protect yourself. learn how to use encryption, about software and paper wallets and how to use them. If you are dabbling in this you have to realize that it's still the 'wild west' and it's your responsibility to to safeguard your property. 
Start with small amounts and develop knowledge and trust and you'll be fine.

The buy limit is 10 BTC for me as well but on the buy page on the right side you should see something that says something like. 
"You can buy up to 0.025 BTC worth of bitcoin instantly with no waiting."
I don't think anyone has an instant buy limit as large as 10 btc, I think you are mistaking the total daily buy limit with the instant buy limit.

I am having almost the same thoughts lately &amp; also been very bullish up to very recently.  I still think that if buying them could be made easier that they would work best for quick, small transactions over the internet.  
If you could buy $20 worth quickly and use them for small transactions, things like music downloads, movie downloads and access to content, then I think there would be a powerful need because paypal's and CC fees make this cost prohibitive. 
For larger purchases, as a consumer I still would probably prefer the security and ability to charge-back using credit cards. This may be solvable through escrow services and the like. Lots of minds are working on these issues, who knows what will come?
The great thing about bitcoin though is that it has many possible uses, some we haven't even thought of. I think it will find it's niche and continue to grow, but probably will start growing more slowly at some point.

All you need with bitcoin is a sending address and a receiving address. No names, no address.  It's perfect for paying for something like a NYT online subscription, which requires no shipping address. 
I generally respect Krugman but I think he misses this important point and is only looking at bitcoin as a commodity and not seeing it for the utility it is.

The way I see it is in comparing it with my everyday world. When I'm walking around this earth, I often come across things that I would like to buy, like say a candy bar, or a newspaper and all I have to do is whip out my wallet and hand it to the vendor and I walk away the owner of that thing. 
Now on the internet, I sometimes come across things that I'd like to see or buy but unless it's something I want pretty badly I don't want to go through the hassle of entering my credit card information and giving myself another point of vulnerability as far as that information goes. 
When I come across a page in a newspaper that tells me I need to subscribe to read further, I just get mad and leave the page because again, it's not worth all that hassle. On the other hand, if I could just zap a QR code with my phone and quickly send them the equivalent of a nickel to read the page, or just pay for one day's subscription that way and instantly recieve the access I desire, I'd be much more inclined to do it. It would make the internet feel much more like the way buying a candy bar in the real world feels. It's quick and painless and doesn't give you too much time to think about it and decide, you know what? maybe I don't need this candy bar. 
I think the essential ingredient will be in the ease of use, and further advancements have to be made in order to make it easy to both acquire coins and spending them needs to be as easy as possible, with transactions taking place in the same speed as real world purchasing. 
I believe these advancements will happen as millions of dollars are pouring into bitcoin development by Venture capitalists and a lot of peopl ehave skin in the game and want it to succeed. It also has strong support in the tech community, and a lot of bright people have their brain cells focused on these problems. 
Only time will tell, but that's the way I see it and I'm sticking by my prediction that Bitcoin will change the landscape of internet commerce, mainly due to becoming the defacto standard equivalent of "pocket money" for the internet.

I think it needs to reach a point where there are understandable denominations that are easy to work with. 
I can tell you may different ways to arrive at $100 USD using smaller bills. But with bitcoin there's no ready equivilent to a fiver or tenner like there is with USD. 
There are 100 microbits in a megabit but where's the equivalent to a twenty or a ten? We need these kinds of denominations to be able to quickly do calculations in our meager little human brains. At least I do.

Well if you've completed verified identity, completed a purchase AND have waited 30 days afterwards and still not getting them, then I imagine you need to email a trouble ticket.

You can steal almost anything you want on the internet. I don't have a problem paying for stuff online as I understand that a lot of work went into providing it for me, but I don't really like filling out forms and giving out my cc info too much. 
If I could scan a QR code quickly and anonymously however, I'd probably be a good citizen and pay for my subscription.

THIS is the reason for Bitcoins. Small transactions, especially over the internet. Currently there is no economically feasable way to send a nickel over the internet. I don't think people realize just how important that is and how it could absolutely revolutionize internet commerce having that ability. Entire business models could change because of this. Imagine if you could easily pay fifty cents over the internet for access to a news site for the day. The internet would start to resemble the brick and mortar world.  If I was the New York times or other content driven website, I'd be pushing HARD for bitcoins to become more established.

you can only instant buy a certain amount, which is stated on your buy page. If you buy more than the instant amount, the transaction will take longer. 
I don't work for coinbase (or any exchange), just a fellow redditor.
