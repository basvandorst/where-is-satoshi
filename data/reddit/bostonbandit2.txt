@_date: 2017-07-01 03:11:30
Can someone direct me to a serious subreddit for bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-06-17 02:42:45
If you have to go searching for information it's not clear?
@_date: 2017-06-19 15:06:06
It is fake he deleted the part that said so, he wants karma

"Bro look at how much electricity my silver necklace conducts"
@_date: 2017-06-26 23:30:32
Jimmy Tatro?
@_date: 2017-06-15 12:01:38
I know this is scary but I think it will stabilize just like it did when the ad first came out
@_date: 2017-06-29 00:01:21
As long as you aren't wearing said necklace at time of conduction
@_date: 2017-06-26 23:42:01
"Bro my sweater is worth over 10k"
@_date: 2017-06-29 21:22:06
Yeah but so insignificant that they won't see gains
@_date: 2017-06-17 02:43:14
Not exactly sure I just hope my account doesn't get hacked in the mean time
@_date: 2017-06-16 19:46:56
People seem to not care / fail to mention that they willingly do not tell Canadians they cannot sell BTC but allow them to buy them
Devils advocate of the devil here
@_date: 2017-06-29 21:14:18
This is such a shitpost what the actual fuck
@_date: 2017-07-02 17:40:59
And the Easter bunny is real
And the moon landing was fake
And blah blah
@_date: 2017-06-17 02:41:35
It's no "clear", there is no warning as you send payments..: also; how is it that I could buy coins through the royal bank of Canada but not send it back in.  But yeah keep sucking coinbase' dick
@_date: 2017-06-19 14:43:52
God damnit
@_date: 2017-06-17 19:36:54
Just watch out for the downvote brigade while talking about coinbase.....
@_date: 2017-06-15 21:19:46
I'd keep your funds invested in silver/gold bars until bitcoin stabilizes more 
@_date: 2017-06-15 21:34:19
Problem is everyone decided to buy strictly because of the hype creating a FOMO in people who did/do not know much about the crypto world
@_date: 2017-06-17 03:17:56
You've been coin based my friend
@_date: 2017-06-29 21:34:00
No. No. No. do not use coinbase.  If you use his link to create an account he gets money, be smart please.
@_date: 2017-06-17 02:45:25
If you can buy coins without any sort of warning / pop ups it's a scam I can't even believe you're siding with them, I get it you've had no problems with them but don't think the world revolves around you please.
@_date: 2017-06-17 01:17:37
Actually no lol my funds are frozen with them ATM 
@_date: 2017-06-29 21:41:15
I don't trade for a living or anything, but I can see definitive trend changes after the peak.  I'm in ether due to reasons beyond just "making money quickly".
@_date: 2017-06-20 22:05:19

@_date: 2017-06-19 14:44:22
Multiple fat ones*
@_date: 2017-06-18 17:48:19
Not sure sure
@_date: 2017-06-16 20:03:15
Them failing to mention it is actually against the law and have to fight many court cases because of it... I get it that most businesses scam people but that doesn't excempt you from the law
@_date: 2017-06-18 17:36:08
I was right about to say something about that haha
@_date: 2017-06-16 02:02:08
Wait for the situation to cool down.
@_date: 2017-06-16 19:44:38
One sec lemme pull up my jaxx address for you ;)
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:12:41
Banks will no longer run the world when bitcoin expands further, they're scared ;)
@_date: 2017-06-17 03:25:41
Sign my forehead?
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:16:24
