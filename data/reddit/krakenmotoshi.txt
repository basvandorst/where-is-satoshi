Hi UnusualEngineer,
As per the instructions on our **Funding &gt; Deposit &gt; Canadian Dollar (CAD)** page, you need to wire money inside of Canada.
We never accepted CAD wires in the US. We did accept them in Japan at one point though, but that's no longer the case.
For the latest deposit instructions, always ONLY check your Kraken account. Please don't ask for deposit instructions from the internet. This is how people end up getting scammed.

If you're storing funds on an exchange, you're not being your own bank.

As for sending funds from RBC, according to their website it unfortunately looks like they don't have an option to send domestic wire transfers online -- only international ones. They write that domestic wires have to be done in-branch at a cost of $45 :/
I'd call RBC client support to double check though. Call the number on the back of your debit card.

As long as you're within your daily and monthly withdrawal limits, there shouldn't be any issues.
Note that withdrawal limits are displayed in USD values, not EUR values, and that "daily" counts the last 24 hours and "monthly" counts the last 30 days (i.e. it's not by calendar month).

Hi TheCuriousOne, you can find an explanation of our funding limits here: [
Generally only a specific deposit or withdrawal will be frozen if it would push you over the limits. But it unfreezes automatically after a couple of days once your limits reset.
We ask for source of funds proof for higher verification tiers.
