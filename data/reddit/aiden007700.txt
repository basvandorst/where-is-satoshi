As a professional investor you are well deserved and are comfortable with your position. Rebalanceing is optional, but some experts are against it.

It's a free market, I wuld buy 100$ worth at 23$ even if I knew there's a 50% chance it will go to zero just so I can say I had about 5 full Bitcoins at one point. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:06:26
Satoshi is already on the exchanges theoretically, besides you will scare new people off if they try to buy 1000 Satoshi and need to pay a 5$ fee. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 09:48:55
If you believe that the price will keep going up then it doesn't matter when you buy, it's actually better to buy now. If you have doubts then go do some research and deside for your self. There are always dips, but why wait?

No I don’t, I’m a fan of bitcoin but it’s going to drop like a rock. It’s the dot com bubble, I would not be surprised if there would be a 80-95% crash over the next year. But I bet you prices will bounce back over the next 10 years.

As crypto currencies become more known Bitcoin will slowly become irrelevant, it has many issues around it and it's deflationary. It will go down in the books as the crypto that started it through. The only question is how long will Bitcoin stay on top.

If the dollar or euro where to collapse then so wuld bitcoin… 
@_date: 2017-09-16 10:57:52
Yes but gold was pegged to the dollar, bitcoin is not. Meaning for bitcoin to keep going up in price we all need to start using it. 
 
@_date: 2017-09-16 10:55:26
Idc what ppl do with there money, but if you want but coin to succeed you need to use it. If you won’t you might as well put on a tin foil hat sit in the corner and call yourself a millionaire.    
@_date: 2017-09-16 11:06:48
Bitcoin is not gold, it’s similar to gold in the fact that it in theory will appreciate over the long term, but the plus is that you can dived it much easer then gold, and you can pay some one in seconds halfway around the world in seconds. I’m all for bitcoin but it needs to be adapted by more to keep going up in value. I have money in bitcoin and I use it every day and I replace the amount I used every day and I’m just as invested as others in bitcoin so don’t  think I’m hating. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 11:15:04
Your spot on, and you got my point. Yes your right I and a lot of others lose a bit in transaction fees but we still pay to try to get the ball rolling. Yes I do ask shop owners if they have there own bitcoin wallet if they accept it in the store and when I lived in Brooklyn I would do the same.

I wuld call it a commodity for now, its not backed by the courts. If I have a judgement in place and I need to pay you to satisfy the judgement and I offer you Bitcoin you can say no, and I wuld need to find some one who will accept my Bitcoin and give me cash to pay you. That's a commodity not Mony. One day maby but not yet.

No one will care about 4k, in general, they only pay attention if a transaction is above 10k, besides even if it is 10k they won't do anything unless you are trying to evade taxes or do something else illegal. don't worry.

Bitcoin does not need to be liquidated, just used the same way you would use a dollar, and there’s in-convince when using bitcoin IE high fees but over time improvements to can be made to lower the fee. But that might not come if we don’t start using it for what it was intended to be used for. Not long term holdings but an alternative currency. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 11:22:03

Thank you… most of us don’t have more then 1 bitcoin the volatility is driven by a very small amount of users.  
@_date: 2017-09-18 22:05:48
In the US you would if you made a profit on it. ex if you bought at 1k then you report the 3k as income. However, if you are out of work then I doubt your income is that high and you would not need to pay tax on it even if you bought it for 5$. Of course you should consult with a tax adviser.

@_date: 2017-09-16 10:50:38
But it looks like 99% of bitcoin users just hodl, ask your self when was the last time you used it at a store or told some shop-owner to start accepting it? Yes I’m all for hodling bitcoin but use it every day and just replace it as you spend it. No one will adapt if it’s not actually being used. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 14:53:47

Well is it not? Those who got in 6 years ago are now have millions, and in order for there bitcoins to keep going up they need more of us to adapt and get in. They can hold there 1000 Bitcoin while we fight over our .1.

What you described is an investment. He was right that it's a horrible store of value. so don't get others confused. I'm invested in Bitcoin and only as much as I can loose, where as a store of value shuld make you confident enough to out your whole net worth In it if need be (never do that)

Vanguard is really good, bitcoin is only 10% of my portfolio always diversify. If it goes up by 1000% then ill be happy, if it goes to zero whatever. I strongly recommend getting some mid and small cap exposure along with the s&amp;p 500 that way no matter what happens you will be set for the long term.

Yes, and that's a good thing not a bad thing. Inflation gives us an incentive to invest money. Who cares if the dollar will be worth 100x less in x amount of time. As long as the inflation is controlled everything is ok.  Mony is just a medium of exchange, your not ment to hold cash long term. 
I'm all crypto currency and I have a bit of Bitcoin but I don't see it beeing the dominant long term crypto because it's deflationary. Yes I herd the argument that it's digital gold but that's what you have physical gold for. I bet Bitcoin will go up in price for a few years after a small correction now but something else will definitely take over the market cap on the years to come. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 12:37:45
So your telling me that horse carriage manufacturers of the past are an equal comparison to the big banks of today? 
I wuld accept your argument if you where to compare carriage manufacturers to the airline's of today but please don't use them to compare them to banks. 
Banks have so much say in how governments and economys are run, and there filled with smart people, they will adapt. 
Because what will you do if the banks decide and government deside that you can only get payed in legal tender, now your in a situation that you got to swap it out for your Bitcoin and they can figure out a way to charge you during the process. Then you got to pay your taxes in your legal tender so now you need to swap back to dollars, once when they will make some money off of you. 
I can keep going… 
I get the point I'm a fan and huge believer of Bitcoin but you got to look at this realisticly

@_date: 2017-09-16 10:52:28
Yes but the solution is simple, use bitcoin everywhere you can. If you spend 5$ buy 5$ in bitcoin when you get home. That’s how you will help it flourish.
