Bro, I doubt people in Venezuela have money to buy mining rigs when they don't even have what to eat, even if electricity and petrol are practically free.

Even then it would be more profitable to mine in China, as electricity there is also very cheap, and they can get the miners cheaper as most factories are located in China.
Btw I know who the wealthiest people in my country are, so for me that is not true. I live in a rather small country though.

Most people with money left the country months ago.
Edit: also, it's not only that most people don't have money, but also that the availability of products is so scarse.

If you are suggesting another country caused what is happening in Venezuela then you are a hypocrite. That's the discourse that Maduro's goverment gives to justify the harm they have done to their country. You can't blame outsiders without even criticizing the internal and main problem first, which is a goverment that has stolen from its people, putting their ideology before the lives of their people.

It's not just the fault of socialism. It is the fault of decades of a mediocre leftist goverment, which harmed the country in several ways causing the socio-economic crisis that is going on right now.

Maduro's failure was to become president at first, he simply isn't prepared for that, and we can see the result that has had right now. The goverment has killed students who were protesting because the do not have medicine.
I didn't get what you said about "some fascist General". What destroyed their economy was bad management and politicians stealing for personal gain, of course the rest of the world reacts to what is happening in Venezuela but that is an effect, not the cause.
There no "color revolution" in Venezuela, I agree with that, there just normal people protesting because they don't have what to eat, and there is people dying because they can't get their medicine.
Again, I didn't get what you said about the opposition. What is true is that Maduro's approval rate is at about 23% right now, I think that number speaks for itself, people are protesting because their life conditions are miserable, it's not just being "opposition" meaning ideological differences.
The situation in Ukraine was very different to Venezuela right now, in Ukraine people were fighting for ideology mainly, people in Venezuela are protesting for hunger. 
I think we agree that Maduro's goverment is doing things wrong, hopefully they will get to the elections without more violence and finally get rid of this shitty goverment.

Oh that makes sense, the reason why I though it was improbable is that it would require to import hundreds of ASICs, but with altcoins it would be GPUs instead.

Not really, if you want bitcoin mining to be profitable you need some really cheap electricity.
I mean, I know because I have read the ranking of the wealthiest persons.

Then I guess you are right, there are people mining bitcoins there
