I caught that too. My thought is that if you don't know anything about cryptocurrencies then how do you know they will come to a bad ending.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:47:16
What did your sister do after you told her about your crypto net worth?
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:02:51
Did you refer someone or did someone refer you?
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:56:41
I wonder if this was posted on r/btc
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:52:24
You're putting a lot of energy into spreading FUD on this sub. You've been doing this for a while. Go get a life!
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:03:06
If it bothers you, then don't use the exchanges or reassure your info is safe by contacting the exchange before doing business with them.
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:49:07
Back then you needed a phone line to access the internet. If I remember correctly, it was called a dial up modem.

*grabs popcorn*
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:47:16
And you will end up overpaying.

I just checked the price on the ledger nano s and the price increased ~$70......on Amazon.
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:24:44
Link? Video?
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:39:46
Because they can afford it.
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:30:49
It's the same damn thing! I'll stick to coinmarketcap!
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:43:52
Cramer brings nothing but a whole bunch of noise!
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:46:35
You mean you didn't recognize them from the "who started Facebook" debacle that took place years ago?
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:04:06
At some point I believe there was a referral bonus or a promotion they had going on.
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:09:41
Hahaha! I'm using this!!
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:26:02
Bitcoin doesn't even compare!
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:19:56
Totally agree that this is boring but it was said that futures will reduce the volatility. I'm wishing for more volatility now.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:30:42
It depends on the circumstances.

Billionaires and millionaires today have taken out loans for investing purposes. The reason why they have the amount of money they have today is because they took a risk and you took a risk and it worked. Don’t listen to these people on here telling you that what you did was stupid. These folks are regurgitating what the media and the government tells them about finances and that’s why most of them are still broke.
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:42:15
In the US, in 2014 the IRS labeled cryptocurrencies "intangible property." That means that all cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, are subject to capital gains tax rules, just like when you sell a stock or other type of capital asset. I doubt taxes will be raised on intangible property to 50-60%. The wealthy aren't having that at all.
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:14:48
That's your opinion. Now scram!
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:49:09
I have no doubt that it is going to reach $20,000 soon.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:56:48
Prepare for takeoff....
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:53:09
Lol, they didn’t know what that circle with the “a” in the middle was. My has the “ symbol evolved.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:26:57
The people who can afford it, yes. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:45:40
Do you!
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:26:44
True! Show us the receipts dammit!
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:46:16
I'm looking at the price of BTC like WTH is going on.....I'm hodling though!
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:35:29
What an asshole!
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:27:40
Oh yeah, he's got the moves! Hahaha! Let me guess, this happened in Atlanta. ��
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:37:30
What does this have to do with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:44:22
As far as I know, hackers only want the coins. I'm not worried.
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:49:32
He doesn’t have to pay taxes... to your friend. When tax time comes around, pay what you owe to the government but the friend shouldn’t be handling that. As for the 33% fee the friend is charging, he’s scamming you guys. Get your BTC, dump the friend!

Do you know how much Zuckerburg is worth? $70.7 billion. The twins are playing catch up.

Ledger nano s
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:59:37
They're something like a package deal. One entity. This article refers to them as such. When it comes to business, they act as one unit instead of individually. It appears that they're always together.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:16:35
Thanks, I'll check out his channel.
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:47:13
Did you refer a friend to Coinbase or did someone refer you? Did you join Coinbase during some sort of promotion they had?
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:53:21
.....or a military dependent.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:08:00
The "then they fight you" stage.

@_date: 2017-12-18 22:38:17
It doesn't sound weird to me. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:57:32
I learn something new everyday! I love the music too!
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:29:00
I’m fine with that! 
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:17:18
I think it's rude too but there are a lot of people out there that think it's okay. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:09:03
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:38:40
I don't think they were billionaires before but I believe that they come from a wealthy family
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:16:38
He had a bunch of haters hanging on to everything he said and down voting the hell out of his comments. He will be fine.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:43:32
What website/app are you looking at? Coinmarketcap.com places it at $16,687.
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:39:56
$165. Ordering my ledger nano s with expedited shipping cost less than that.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:24:50
Wait, what? It hit $18,500 USD?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:28:00
Everyone in the world is trying to buy and some are probably selling.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:21:23
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:41:36
Who knows. They're probably still hodling.
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:29:11
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:48:21
No but you might want to try googling it.
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:47:50
Tell her to go bigger or keep that chump change in her pocket!
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:07:29
You didn’t even try.
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:26:20
@_date: 2017-11-18 18:33:22
Damn Alex!
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:30:04
Thanks for your organizing efforts!
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:00:46
Bitstamp is better.
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:25:35
you can go to college and graduate at any age.
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:14:08
I can’t see it. How much was the fee?
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:06:48
It’s not illegal either....what’s their point?
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:09:37
This should be interesting!
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:45:35
My ledger nano s also comes today! Yay!
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:30:18
That’s what they said about Bitcoin a few years ago.
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:44:25
And not it is back down to $9471.70.
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:41:18
They expect the Bitcoin Segwit2x fork to occur.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:04:12
Have you been liquidated by Kraken? What's your story?
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:18:26
Faster processing of transactions when buying and withdrawing cryptos.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:27:29
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:50:25
it depends...
