True. But eventually the users will decide which chain to use and RSK can run on both. RSK focuses on usability.

RSK does not compete with lightning. A solution that provides protocol scalability like lightning can be implemented on RSK and would benefit the RSK network.

Once the proposed BIP is implemented, the Bitcoin miners will secure the peg with the federation.

RSK is the first smart contracts protocol fueled by Bitcoin. It works with a two way peg with the Bitcoin network and it is secured via merge-mining. It is compatible with solidity and can handle up to 400 tx/sec. rsk.co

LN can be implemented on RSK as well. That will be decided by the miners who will merge-mine on RSK.

RSK can work without that soft fork.

RSK has already proposed a BIP to implement an hybrid model between the federation AND the bitcoin miners.

It is being reviewed as every new implementation!

The RSK team supports all the scalability and Bitcoin improvements solutions. Although, Bitmain is RSK's main investor, RSK has a mind of its own. Is wierd the question given you know  closely..

You should be able to deploy your contract seamlessly..

Jaxx already does it!

Segwit is not needed for RSK to work!

RSK will be launched on the 22nd of May at Consensus NYC.

Is not "them", but a federation of renowned Bitcoin related companies with proper security measures. Also, once the BIP proposed by RSK is approved, the Bitcoin miners will take part in this process too.

RSK does not mint any new coin but works with Bitcoin..
@_date: 2017-05-07 22:54:55
This is not correct. RSK is a Bitcoin sidechain so smart contract state changes will not be stored in the Bitcoin network blocks. Thus, the blocks do not have to be larger.

That's an incorrect statement. RSK has several features in its roadmap: Lumino network, storage rent, fiat pegged gas costs, full nodes rewards... just to name a few. Also, RSK leverages the bitcoin network consensus mechanism between other features that differentiate the project from Ethereum.

RSK will not go live on June but 4/6 months from the launch at Consensus.
