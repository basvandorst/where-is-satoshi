Bitcoin gained traction because some ecosystem - Underground markets - created a need for it. This created a system to demand and trade bitcoins solely, and therefore it became a value asset someways. Pitching bitcoin as a competitor to traditional currency now is almost a lunacy. We're in a highly capitalist world where the powers that be need their control, and will do anything to maintain it. Bitcoin is challenging that, and yes I love it, but it's a fancy thing that in itself cannot afford to buy as well require a capitalist scheme to bring it to sustainability. The Internet is a revolutionary platform whose survival was not  to compete, but to compliment traditional, and therefore becoming its own ecosystem, which by popular demand, moved it into the comfort zone of capitalist as a strong alternative that eventually becomes widespread adopted as a default platform for everything. It was a humble and smart move using the same scheme capitalists use to become a main fold. As a platform I think Bitcoin is the greatest crypto currencyodel. As a "brand" for crypto currency am not sure of its survival. However, I beleive the model will be adopted in some future accounting system, currency model or even in communications.
The other option of driving real survival there's a need to go back to the economics class and to create a real ecosystem where traditional currency by firsthand isn't accepted as a trading tender, but only Bitcoin. It's the way out in the current spade of things. We need a global investment from Bitcoin to be launched with goods and services provided only accessible by Bitcoin. This is the way to create traction for Bitcoin and then support it to become some defacto asset that can deliver strong two way competitive trade with traditional currency. Otherwise, it's a great dream with everything about it being highly uncertain.
