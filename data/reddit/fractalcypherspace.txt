Bitcoin would enable flow in both directions, but there will probably be much more flow away from the weak ruble to stronger currencies.

Since attacking would devalue the BTC, it would be better to think about it in terms of purchasing power.

Shocking that your critique includes nothing related to gaming.

What makes you think bitcoin has to replace the dollar to be a success? Bitcoin is just an alternative way to pay for things and that's all it needs to be a success.

I joined for and also found out about reddit because of bitcoin.

Nevada hasn't done anything good or bad yet, but I think the odds are very good that future regulations will be very liberal. Our tax laws are designed to attract maximum business. The state doesn't even collect data on income, so they have nothing to report to the federal gov't or IRS ;)

I think once a large enough amount of people have a digital wallet of some sort, newspapers will get a big boost in revenue by a low cost subscription model. Something like a Netflix model. As long as the cost is low enough to make most people just shrug and say "yea whatever."

The website wasn't shut down by the authorities. The operators (overseas most likely) chose to shut down due to a server abnormality and this incident occuring at the same time. Micon was a spokesperson and probably part owner.

Micon didn't run the site. He's called the chairman but he's basically a spokesperson and a site pro. He's probably also a part owner. He has basically no technical skills besides (very shoddy) podcasting. The site was created by someone named Freemoney and run by a small crew of anonymous devs.
The majority ownership chose to shut down the site because of a suspicious server anomaly coinciding with this incident.
