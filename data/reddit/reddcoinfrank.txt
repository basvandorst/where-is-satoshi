Well, considering I'm only 17 without a job, almost two hundred dollars is almost all of my money.
@_date: 2014-04-18 01:20:47
I'm underage,  but I'll have one on you when I can! Thanks man!
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:48:12
*raises hand*
Well, I did.
Thanks, MtGox. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 17:43:31
I lost some too. It sucks - I wasn't home the week it all happened, so I couldn't withdraw. 
Bye bye, 2.5 BTC. I know I'm a small loser, but :(
@_date: 2014-03-30 05:22:01
$50?! You just gave to a stranger what takes me over 6 hours of work to make.
You're very generous.
@_date: 2014-03-04 03:58:05
Think he got paid $678.28 to do this?
@_date: 2014-03-07 22:32:21
I'll admit - tears were shed.
I lost more money than I'd ever had at once.

Nah, you can have them back, :)
Have 2 jersey cows! @_date: 2014-03-06 20:48:41
I can honestly say that's the largest bItcoin tip I've seen yet. 
@_date: 2014-04-02 01:33:08
I've seen more currency given away in this thread than I have in total. 
What a generous community! 
@_date: 2014-06-23 23:27:57
Thanks! It's a start to building back up!
I appreciate it.
@_date: 2014-03-07 14:47:54
That's actually not a bad idea.
@_date: 2014-06-24 01:57:59
Thanks! :)
@_date: 2014-03-30 05:45:10
You just made me feel really good after a crappy couple days. Thank you, I'll be sure to donate what you gave me and then some. :)
@_date: 2014-05-08 02:47:27
I would, but I've only got $4 worth of Bitcoin now. 
@_date: 2014-04-18 01:05:55
If it weren't for Bitcoin,  there'd be no Dogecoin. 
I'm sure they don't mind,  ;)
@_date: 2014-04-19 14:32:00
You shut him down quickly. 
Nice job on the sources and quotations. 
@_date: 2014-06-24 00:30:40
Ah, thanks! Then here, have a smile! @_date: 2014-03-04 16:42:22
Goodbye,  my bItcoins.  :c
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:58:24
I apologize, but what do you mean? 
@_date: 2014-05-08 02:59:38
Hmm... seems interesting. I definitely will - thanks!
@_date: 2014-04-03 13:30:21
Same here.  Bitcoin got some good publicity because of the publicity of Dogecoin. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 06:32:19
I've been called an idiot by a few people because I lost 2.5 BTC...
Some people are just rude. 
@_date: 2014-03-11 00:39:22
Jimmy Wales?
More like *Dorian* Jimmy Wales.
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:55:29
I've seen people lose hundreds... 2.5 was all I had - so I guess it was kinda big.
@_date: 2014-03-10 23:26:32
I wish! 
@_date: 2014-04-17 21:56:43
You aren't the only one. I've been thinking about getting into bitcoin by trading some altcoins for BTC...
@_date: 2014-03-24 02:29:39
"Buy buy buy - they're paying us to buy!"
@_date: 2014-03-07 20:40:58
I'm relatively new to Cryptocurrencies, so I just used what my friend recommended.  
@_date: 2014-03-28 06:47:18
Ha,  I wish I had even .386 BTC.
@_date: 2014-06-18 00:19:47
Or maybe they are in it for fun instead of profit.
@_date: 2014-03-07 15:00:35
Well - we've got the Blockchain, but we missed the Gold train.
Sorry, PsychOutX. 
@_date: 2014-05-08 10:11:37
Oh wow - thanks!
@_date: 2014-03-07 23:16:12
I'm trying to learn,  though. But I know what you mean.
@_date: 2014-03-12 21:44:54
Oh dear. 
@_date: 2014-06-17 23:35:23
Not a dev, but I can say why I think they would do this.
First question - Wider array of users. There are a lot of Bitcoin users that don't use, say, Dogecoin. And vice versa,  of course. 
Second question - no idea on this one. That's entirely their call, obviously. 
Third question - red, because any other answer is wrong.
@_date: 2014-03-24 13:53:03
I'll sell you a set now for .02 BTC
@_date: 2014-05-08 10:18:39
Thank you!
:D
