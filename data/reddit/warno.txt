The development timeline is ridiculous, it claims that blockchain technology started being tested in 2016...
Bitcoin was created in 2009 --'

They do not consider Bitcoin and other cryptos to be legitimate blockchain technology.
It would not make sense for them to do so given their rhetoric: "Bitcoin = bad , Blockchain = great"
The dates are probably from corporate blockchain projects

Probably an exchange given the number of outputs

Ok, still a great job, I shared with some friends ;)

Yeah I agree with you, the author does not seem to see the difference. Most of the time the people that are criticizing Bitcoin don't fully understand it...

The network cannot confirm more than 2000 transactions per block, and it happens 6*24 times  a day so the maximum number of comfirmed tx per day is around 300 000. That is between 3 and 4 a second.

Most likely, yes. 
The energy consumption is linked to the price of the Bitcoin and the time between new blocks. Today it is very inefficient because you can only put  ~2000 transactions inside a block. 
If offchain scaling becomes a reality the energy cost per transaction will drop.

The network cannot handle so many transactions before Lightning Network implementation.
Would you pay a 5$ tx fee for a 3$ meal ?

The figures are for a total hashrate of 7 000 000 TH/s, today  it is around 12 000 000 Th/s

A blockchain without cryptographic concensus is just a shared database

1 BTC means you are in the top ~14%

I think that all the exchanges with BTC/USD trades can do this. 
Here is the full list of exchanges: 
I would recommend using GDAX where you can avoid paying fees :
