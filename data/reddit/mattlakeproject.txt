Any form of value that is anonymous can arguably be used to fund malicious activities. 
Blockchain is actually the worse medium of exchange to use if you’re a bad actor,  as it’s fully transparent and fully traceable.

I agree with your sentiments here that Bitcoin is a deflationary asset while with fiat, your wealth is technically subject to the whims of your government. However I think it may be a little far fetched to peg this as a zero sum scenario. 
IMHO I see this space playing out like the dot com rise, with distributed ledger technology (blockchains, DAGs, and whatever comes after) spawning new waves of enterprises, and adoption increases over time as we discover and optimize and build stacks for different use cases and industries, eroding previous inefficiencies, and creating massive new value and jobs in the process. 
This new value doesn’t necessarily need to only come from replacing the incumbents, as I believe there are paradigm financial and cultural shifts that blockchain enables and we have yet to discover all the ways we can wield this new found power. 
While this is the Bitcoin sub and my opinion may be unpopular, I don’t see the future of this industry being monopolized by Bitcoin. I see Bitcoin becoming more of a backbone settlement and security layer upon which further technology stacks are built upon. It will shift from the original vision of electronic cash, and adapt to the realities of what its actually suitable for given the state of the changing industry, and that’s being (one of) the secure settlement and reserve layers.

If wealth is being lost, you can be certain it will not help crypto. People aren’t going to dump their wealth and investments into an even riskier asset class if they’re bleeding already.

I guess being a puppet for incumbents pays well.

It’s literally the catalyst for teaching me about the history of money and financial markets. It also got me involved and working in the blockchain industry.

DLTs doesn’t mean you have to have a token. It’s simply as its name implies, a distributed ledger system. A blockchain can be a DLT, so can a tangle or a number of distributed servers with some kind of shared ledger system.

First rule of investing is time in the market, not timing the market. Buy quality assets, with the lowest possible entry cost, and then have patience and do nothing.

It’s a stablecoin, you can buy it and sell it right back, there’s really no loss there.

For the record the project is run by a non-profit named Libra, the code for the blockchain is being developed by Facebook and is open source. Facebook will also only have 1 vote in the network. 
Whether those hold true remains to be seen, but it is not as bad as everyone initially thought or is painting it out to be if you actually read the white paper.

Invest in real estate before cars, you don’t want to put money in a depreciating asset.

Was looking at this too, great API and really great work they’re doing aggregating all this data.

My team and I have actually been building an AI driven investment product that lets you simply connect with a Binance API key, we’ve been benchmarking it and we’ll be productizing it soon. For those interested feel free to DM me I’m happy to share more info. 
I know AI is a buzzword but this is a 3 years in the making project, and we just happen to apply it in the crypto markets. It’s using genetic algorithms and pseudorandomness to find and predict optimal portfolios. 
Basically what this product will do once it’s finished is build you a portfolio and automatically invest and rebalance for you. It’s like a Wealthsimple or Wealthfront for crypto assets.

If you want a job as a writer you should publish some content on Medium or volunteer to projects and help write content for them to build a portfolio.
