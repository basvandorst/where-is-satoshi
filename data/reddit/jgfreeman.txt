The original one I saw said Heroin in r/opiates but both of these forums deal with shooting up in one way or another.

I actually had a few Bitcoin wallets I filled as I was buying in October early November. I spread out my purchases over two weeks over a few wallets.
Ok so if I check the details using blockchain info I can see if it was before or after 491406, that will also tell me if I have any of the other currencies?
Also what was the actual date or cut of time?

Honestly, I feel guilty because I got him interested in investing in Bitcoin but at the same time I want to laugh because it was so obviously a scam. I mean I warned him and he almost acted offended that I would suggest this person he just met on Facebook would scam him. Two major red flags was this guy sent him a screenshot of his Bitcoin wallet showing 1,790 Bitcoins and a copy of his Texas commercial driving license with a PO Box address. I mean who just sends someone screenshots of their wallet and ID before they even agreed to a deal?

I hope to have another update to this thread soon. This is what I am thinking, my friend is claiming to have the funds sent to him in a new wallet in bitcoins for the correct value of 25k but I bet this "2 hours a day mining guy" convinced him to not pull his money and stay with the "mining contract" or whatever was sold to him.
In fact I bet you guys could verify to see if this is true simply by asking the guy if he sells straight Bitcoins without a "contract".

You know I asked my friend this, he said Bitcoin and he sent me a screenshot of a Bitcoin wallet with 4 Bitcoins in it valued at 35k. I asked him, how much did you send him, he said 25k and then I asked him how does he have 35k in less than 24 hours. He said that apparently it was "mined" in the last 24 hours since he invested. I told him to pull his money now! He was being scammed.  I said its impossible to mine that amount in less than 24 hours. My friend didn't even know what mining really was let alone if he had the private keys to that wallet.

I have no idea on that one, hashflare. I can't speak on it. I think that newbies should just avoid mining type gimmicks at all costs. Most of them turn out to be scams or ponzis, it is MY opinion that they are not worth the risk because so many turn out to be scams. Are there honest ones that pay? Maybe, but it's not a lot.
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:03:45
I'll be honest with you. My friend is so embarrassed over what happened he stop responding to my messages, so I can't get anymore details. He doesn't know about this thread... yet.
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:27:52
(EDIT to add: This was a lie by my friend to keep us from laughing at him for losing 25k...)Small update, my friend claims he recovered the Bitcoins. He got the current market rate of Bitcoins transferred to a new wallet. I have my doubts but according to him he believes he wasn't scammed.

Invest in Sub-Saharan Africa, what could go wrong?

I don't want your cash nor would I collect donations for my friend, sometimes people need to learn a life lesson.
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:24:57
Update, yup he never received any Bitcoins. I guess he told us he did because we all were laughing at him. Scammer is supposed to meet my friend face to face to give money back this week. I think we all know whats going to happen.
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:20:30
It better make like r/opiates/ and start shooting up.
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:11:15
11/8/17 Update: Scammer never showed for face to face meeting. Of course he did not have the private keys to the wallet he thought he had showing his bitcoins "transferred". Friend is now aware of this thread, hopefully I can convince him to do an AMA if not I think this thread will die a slow and painful death. Since my friend maybe reading feel free to post a message for him to read.

I am a professional Bitcoin miner with over a hundred miners in my pool and more than four hundred active antminers. With my mining system, you can earn up to 1.4btc in a month.

You guys can use Google to find it. I hope I'm not violating rules by posting this.

11/9/17 Update: Looks like a scam ran by Pakistanis, we were able to trace his cash was a wire to wire transfer from Chase to another Chase account. Looks like the person receiving the funds was a patsy, she turned the info over right away. She was made to split the funds in two and wire half to a US bank account in an elderly ladies name and the other half to a foreign corporations account in another major US bank. The latter transfer was done all in cash. The facebook account of Andre Parson is a fake profile with stolen photos of someone else. If you look at the friends you can see they are all Pakistanis, in their 20's, we suspect that these were the guys running the actual scam.

It's now becoming an inside joke amongst my friends. "You want to watch the game, then maybe afterwards we can mine Bitcoin for two hours?"
