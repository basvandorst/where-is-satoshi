The bad news: My Crypto portfolio crashed. 
The good news: My millennial co-workers can't afford to retire this weekend after all.

They say a picture is worth a thousand words, but you just the described the whole world inside this GIF for the low low price of 31 perfect words.

Study one religion, become a priest.
Study two religions, become an atheist.

Still a better deal than spending govt currency (if it even exists). I can only imagine getting my pay in cash and turning around to prices that have doubled because I allowed 10 minutes to pass between getting paid and buying food.

This.   I simply tell close friends and family what I am doing in order to clear my conscience.  I tell them I am not selling them anything, just letting them know so they don't get mad at me later for not giving them the heads up.
Nearly everyone who got this speech from me is now in at some level.
Reverse psychology works like a charm here.

Where do they get the money that they lend?

I am only losing 2% annually in fiat.   Basically nothing lost to inflation in single day or however long it takes to move a BTC transaction.   Am I misunderstanding your point?   
If I need to buy something for $10, what is the best way to do so?    Should I move a few bucks to another coin for that? 
Am really asking.  So confused about the advantage of "no middle man fees".

Can't wait to hear all about it.

Way to trivialize.  If it were police and fire we would have gold plated fire trucks and time cops.
Govt services destroy incentives for citizens to contract with their local community.  When all have a stake in the community, there is no incentive to steal from it, effectively nearly eliminating a need for a police force beyond Sheriff Andy Taylor.

Maybe we are saying the same thing, but with a known deadline looming, I figure folks are converting CNY Fiat to BTC as fast as possible.     In a few weeks they won't be able to buy BTC without a ton of work/fees/transactions.

I haven't tried one, but aren't the exchange rates way over market and fees are high?

Seriously please sell two to me.   The two guys in my office who got me all excited to jump in to crypto deserve one for Xmas. 
I know everyone says they will buy one and then nobody buys one.  
In a couple years we can make a smart contract and guarantee payment.   I'm learning so much!

Restrictions on fiat?  That makes working with fiat more expensive and lowers its intrinsic value.  That makes BTC that more appealing.  As the world economy grows and becomes more integrated (entangled), BTC will be low friction and fiat will be a major PitA
