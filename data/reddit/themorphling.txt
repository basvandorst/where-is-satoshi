Girls laugh at me, I must be on the right track

That thousand yard stare... Does it reflect the current dip in price?

I bought some with 10€ some time back, but they are now down to 7,5€ or something like that, so yeah... I'll just watch from the side lines, I guess

Makes me always little sad when I think back. I considered investing small amoints monthly (price was ~10€/BTC) but I didn't have faith.

Yeah security is always a trade off with convenience, I don't think theft should be the primary concern before communication is dealt with since your current form of payment are just as easy to steal. Maybe a simple pin/password would be sufficient for now? 
As for the certification thing, it's fine, but I'm still vary of man in the middle attacks against SSL certificates.
But I don't know, as I said I'm not expert, but I'd like to be able to buy stuff with bitcoins :)

I'm kind a mad at myself for not believing in Bitcoin enough. When the price was hovering around $10 and was on it's way to $11 I thought hard and long about buying some bitcoins, I actually thought that I could easily buy one per month and it wouldn't be a big financial hit even as I was a student barely scrapping by, but I didn't believe that the price would climb.
Man I would have some mad cash now... Well, now bought some super late $10 worth of bitcoins, but I'm not really hoping on banking any serious profit off of it I just want to be part of it.

I'm no expert, but from purely logical view point QR code is visual data, you need line of sight to capture it while NFC is radio signal which in worst cases can penetrate walls e.g. line of sight to a display is not necessary.
So let's say our device only transmits the data (QR code or the NFC signal) when we physically push a button to minimize risk of exposure. You could face the display towards the payment terminals camera press the button, have the terminal read the code and you'd be done with minimal exposure, with NFC as soon as you press the button any device near or far is going to get receive it.
Maybe this isn't a big deal, but considering how far you can read NFC devices from this does present a way to at least monitor the device if not attack it.
