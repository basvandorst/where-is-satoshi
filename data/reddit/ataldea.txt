Isn't that a bit dangerous? Don't keep a lot of money on that address. Better safe than sorry.

Thanks but saying "ton of holes" doesn't give me very useful info. What can go wrong and at which point. I also do not intend to keep too much ($ wise) on Exodus and ease of access is mu more important for those funds that I will keep there. I don't store millions of dollars, not even thosands so I don't need best extreme hardware wallet. I would appreciate if someone could create a step by step guide for storing BTC because I think this is one of the reasons we can't have mass adoption. Even if you are tech savvy there is ton of stuff you need to learn in order to do it properly. Saying that doesn't help. I knew that already ;)

Bitconnect ;) 
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:07:25
Nah, neither. Bitcoin is so 2010..

Yeah, I thought we should have all of them in one place so we can discuss address no2x movement.

It was also meant to be decentralized...

It was a joke. Bitconnect is a Ponzi scheme. LTC for life. IOTA over eth but that's just my opinion.

My point is that is hard being right in non-consensus. Emotionally. I don't want banks to get bailed out but I have no control over it. Bitcoin gives me the option to say "fuck this, I am not taking part in your system". System that is designed to enrich few instead of giving people option (by providing sound money) to not only choose what they will invest into but also WHEN as it does not punish holding money and waiting for better opportunity and doesn't force regular people (IT guy, Nurse, Plumber) to do part-time stock trading or other shit where they have no edge. Bitcoin allows you to keep your hard earned money because you choose to do so.

This x100.

Second rule of Bitcoin is: You do not talk about YOUR bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-09-29 07:02:09
So what if they offer faster and better options. I don't care if they are clone but what they offer. So even if they started as clone it matters that they are better now and if people behind have community interest in mind. Like always - do your own research but argument that they are clone is flawed (?). Correct me if I'm wrong ofc.

Why, why, why.. why people still keep money in btc. There is plenty of better coins with your best interest in mind.

This. It's good that people are talking about dangers and frauds that you can encounter in crypto. There should be more YouTubers talking about this. I love BTC and crypto but people lose a lot of money not knowing basics you guys think everyone knows.

Money is uncountable but bitcoins aren't. We know 1bitcoin is 100 000 000 satoshis (s as well) hence if you have 200 000 000 satoshis they have 2 bitcoins. If you have 10 units of something and you can easly define them then you cannot say they uncountable. 2 ounces of gold. Gold is uncountable but ounces are. Same with bitcoins. They are the unit of account made of smaller units of account on the Bitcoin network that are easy to define and have definition that is agreed upon by everyone using this network. Imo bitcoins.
Edit: and yeah, Bitcoins does not sound right cause unless you start a sentence with it, then you are referring to a network. And there is only one Bitcoin network ;)
