I've been in bitcoin since May 2011. I found the official client to be slow and unnecessary. Nowadays I just use blockchain.info wallet, it's even more secure and so easy to backup. Just put the encrypted backup in dropbox, if your password is strong, it's impossible to break the encryption(well not really impossible, but just takes a really long time).

Basically, if you do not get nearly free electricity, you shouldn't get into mining, remember the people who get nearly free electricity are the people you are competing with.

Yahoo started as site directory and later a portal, it never focused on developing a viable search engine. Google was the first to develop a real usable search engine that gave accurate results based on a pagerank system.
MySpace is completely different from facebook, facebook is a "real name" based social network, the first of its kind.
What other online auction sites? I didn't see any mentioned in the article, unless you count posting auctions on BBS or cableTV auction ads as "ebay-like online auction". eBay was first of its kind in streamlining online auction.
My point is, google and others brought something new and better to the table, and gained the advantage of first to market. Nothing stops you from cloning these sites, but unless you can bring something new and better, you are not going to attract any attention.

Assume price stay the same, difficulty stay the same (both could go higher or lower, but we can't predict the future). 1.5 GH/s can be bought for $1000 (5x 5830 $550 + $180 mobo + $35 sempron 140 cpu + $15 ram + $200 PSU + $5 flashdrive + $20 risers)
This set up earns $380 per month, minus electricity cost of $50 per month (depends on actual cost, most people have lower than $50, some have slightly higher), that's $330 per month, so he gets his money back in slightly more than 3 month time in perfect operation, but let's figure in some downtime and hardware failure,  that would still be well within 6 month, isn't it? 
@_date: 2011-06-18 04:35:58
Well I guess we got the confirmed answer today. There was an security exploit in mtgox code that will allow attackers to empty anyone's account if the are logged into mtgox.
@_date: 2011-06-16 15:50:06
It is you that don't understand. The miners guild want price to be stable, that's the only way the miners can profit, the miners do not want swings we just saw a few days ago ($30 -&gt; $10 -&gt; $20). Therefore they do everything they can to stabilize the price.
@_date: 2011-06-08 15:40:49
hold on to them
@_date: 2011-06-20 13:14:33
only if you believe the mtgox story, that someone was hold 500k+ btc (worth almost 10 million dollars) in their mtgox account.
@_date: 2011-06-16 14:52:07
nope, the point having difficulty is precisely to adjust for too many/too few bitcoin production. For example toward the end of the 500k difficulty, BTC were produced at a rate of 10000+ per day, while the optimal rate was 7200 per day. So the algorithm adjusted the difficulty to 860k, so we are again producing coins now at around 7000 per day. But if for example 90% of miners went offline, then we would be producing only 700 BTC per day for months until the next difficulty adjustment. The price will certainly rise in reaction to this.
@_date: 2011-06-15 04:04:16
definitely not true. Currently the top500 super computer in the world, combined, can not beat the Bitcoin network in terms of computing power.

If Tycho was indeed trustworthy, he would've built some feature that limited his mining power to less than 33% of the network. But he didn't, so I don't think he's that trustworthy.

as this is a p2p system, it's your own responsibility to backup your wallet.dat, I use external HD+dropbox, to back it up, I wrote a scheduled job to 7-zip it with 256bit AES encryption, then copy the zip file to external HD and dropbox folder.

@_date: 2011-06-16 19:50:38
except the reality is that those people that already have rigs, will keep on mining regardless of difficulty, unless profitability goes to negative after figuring electricity cost. Difficulty will discourage new entrants, but will do nothing to the people that already have rigs.
@_date: 2011-06-21 18:54:06
and use the same password as mtgox no less
@_date: 2011-11-15 00:13:43
supply continue to outstrip demand, that's why. 7200 new coins enter circulation, every single day, that's like a 1% inflation rate PER DAY. To put it into perspective, a 3% inflation rate PER YEAR in the US is considered very high.  
The bitcoin economy simply can't support it, therefore price keep breaking down, one resistance level after another. (if you are into stocks, in a volatile stock, you'll know price don't usually move slowly or linearly, they move by resistance levels)
@_date: 2011-08-18 17:03:41
No you are wrong, mtgox's volume in dollar amounts was negligible before April, tradehill currently has more volume per month in dollar amounts, than mtgox had in a year after it began. 
@_date: 2011-07-26 13:03:21
yeah that's an pretty accurate description. Basically dwolla is being a douchebag, that it got scammed and decided to let Tradehill take the loss.
@_date: 2011-06-22 15:32:05
an exchange is still more secure than  I got burned a few times on  (though paypal had my back and returned the money from the fraudster). I used a very secure password and different on every website, so far nothing has been lost on any exchange, even mtgox.
@_date: 2011-07-21 18:33:00
I don't see why not, price and difficulty has been rather stable in the past few weeks, and they have been pretty stable prior to the big run up in May.

@_date: 2011-07-05 13:11:23
Remember you have to back up your wallet not just once, but every 100 transactions or less. Because every transaction generates a new key in your wallet and your wallet only keeps the newest 100 keys, once 100 new transactions are processed, all your old keys will be gone, and your backed up wallet.dat will be useless if you haven't updated it.
@_date: 2011-08-18 16:52:11
I guess you missed the part I said last 3 month was the stress test because price ran up, stirring up mass interest. No one cares about mtgox/mybitcoin 2 years ago, there was nothing of value to hack.
@_date: 2011-07-21 21:26:55
um the MSI one in the picture is $190 on amazon, or you could get something slightly cheaper, but the MSI one in the picture is really great for mining. You can run as many card as you want, as long as you have the slot. x16 doesn't do shit for mining, you'll mine at the exact same speed if you plug the card into x1, x4, x8.
I run 5 cards with a 1250W PSU, but that's just me, I know people that run 6 or even 8 cards on the same rig using two PSU combined together. But my electrical knowledge is limited, so I don't know how to do it.
@_date: 2011-08-18 15:27:11
Yes, exactly because they haven't screwed up yet. The past 3 month are really the stress testing times, due to the big price run up. Mt.Gox failed the test (multiple times), mybitcoin failed the test (and is now gone), dwolla failed the test, various other sites failed the test, tradehill did not fail at all. So with each day that goes by, tradehill is more trustworthy IMHO. If tradehill withstood the test of the past 2 month, i see no reason to believe they would fail in the future.
@_date: 2011-06-13 20:25:06
you don't need crossfire at all to mine.
@_date: 2011-06-13 19:33:16
It'll take several months to pay off the hardware, and that's assuming the price doesn't crash to sub-$10

nothing will lift the PoS AMD, GPU is only a small segment of their business, and retail GPU is a even smaller segment. Considering the fact that they kicked their CEO (the one responsible for formulating all their current product strategy), have no CEO currently, and failing badly at almost all markets (even in GPU market, NVIDIA controls 60%). I wouldn't bet on the stock going up, they'd be lucky if the stock can just stay at current levels (which it has been failing)

Thanks for the encouraging message. 
@_date: 2011-06-17 17:00:34
quality doesn't really matter, just buy the cheapest PSU you can get, if it crap out, replace it. Chances are it won't crap out any time soon, as long as you don't strain it (like putting 620W on a 600W PSU). Mining is all about buying your hardware cheaply, quality isn't a concern. Since for all we know, in 6 months mining might not even be viable anymore, and even the cheapest hardware will last at least several years probably.

yes, as I said, the world can end tomorrow for all we know, USD can hyperinflate and it'll cost $1 billion to buy a loaf of bread.  BUT no one knows the future, so what we do is calculate reasonably based on current data. If everyone had your mentality, then no one would be holding or working for USD too, since it's "possible" that it'll hyperinflate to be worthless.
@_date: 2011-06-15 20:24:50
except there are tons of dark pool buyers just waiting for some cheap coins, as any significant buyer is using dark pool probably. I think even 80000 coins wouldn't do the trick.

artificial interest can't translate into actual interest, therefore price won't move
@_date: 2011-06-14 15:30:08
Blocks are cracked randomly, but bigger pools have advantage of higher computing power, and mining is all about who solves the block first. For example, deepbit has 3000 GH of power. MTRed has 100GH of power, then deepbit is 30 times more likely to solve the block before MTRed does. On average, deepbit will solve a block 30 times faster than MTRed. So in practice everytime the smaller pools are about to solve a block, the bigger pools gets there first, resulting in the bigger pools earning more BTC, significantly more BTC, than the smaller pools. (The smaller pools do get lucky sometimes and solve a block before the bigger pools, otherwise no one would ever mine at a smaller pool).  The smaller pools generally offer 0 fee, so it's up to you to decide if the 3% fee at deepbit is worth it (I think it definitely is worth it, since you get paid a lot more than at a smaller pool)

his technical ability is irrelevant to his project, that is why he is hiring multiple developers to work on the website itself. His part in the project will be lining up girls (he seems to already have that worked out), marketing the site (he already have a niche audience of 100,000+, and possibly more in the future, we will know about his site because it is the first of its kind in the bitcoin community)
I used to work as a freelance web developer. I have seen clients that create websites from ideas, hire me to do the site, then he markets the site and later successfully sell sites for thousands of dollars. Yet their technical ability is effectively zero, I have to do almost everything except content. Jessy Kang was correct in saying technical ability has little value, it's dime a dozen. 
@_date: 2011-07-06 17:30:08
it kinda already do this, just set up two pools, to mine on the same GPU. Usually it'll mine half/half on both pools, but if one goes down, the other pool's miner will become full power and you won't lose any hash power.

for mtgox, it's less of a problem, because their fee was quite high, they can swallow the small loss, mtgox used to make $6000/day before the hacking incident. (1M monthly btc volume, at 1.3% fee, is 13000 btc per month, which is roughly $180,000 per month pure profit or $6000 per day). Remember the 0.65% fee is charged to both the buyer and seller, so for a single trade, the fee is infact 1.3%

Since they are using a variable commission structure, you can't know you exact commission before you give them email/pw. There commission range is posted before you register, in the FAQ:
Fees and Commissions
In order to pay for server space, network bandwidth, computer programers, and other costs TradeHill charges a small commission on every trade. This commission ranges from 0.25% to 0.75% of your sale and can be found in your user profile. When you create an account using a referral code your commission rate is automatically discounted 10%.

paypal is also an "internet money" website... There are several good reasons that mtgox don't take paypal (and in fact I don't either):

use phoenix miner, and AGGRESSION=5 or less, that'll work great. You can't set the aggression to very low level with the guiminer default OpenCL miner, since the -f switch was designed to give you desktop responsiveness (by taking off 1-3 MH/s), not for enabling gaming.

Actually google's 2-step-verification is for stopping attacker from brute-forcing your google password. It does absolutely nothing if the attacker already know your password. Anyone that already know your password can just install the google authenticator app on their phone and get the code. Do not spread false information that make people think they are secure please.

solo mining is NOT worth it, unless you have something like 50 GH/s under your control. Even for someone with 10 GH/s, he could go several month without finding a single block, if he's on an unlucky streak.

It's plausible deniability, as the authorities has no proof that any subsequent address belong to you after you have sent the coins out from mtgox to another wallet.

The thief is being tracked at his receiving address. So far he has done nothing with the coins except donated 20 to bitcoincharts.com.  He can't really send the coin to mtgox yet, since his name then will be known to authorities since he need a way to withdraw the USD to his bank account.
The thief will need to creatively cover his tracks and probably sacrifice some coins to hide his identity.

How is this less expensive? I can buy two separate new 6870 for less than $350, also this thing doesn't hash as fast as 6990 by far. The attraction of the 6990 is that it is essentially two 6970 combined, for the same price of buying two 6970 separately, plus it saves a lot of space.

Firstly, AMD designs GPUs with many simple ALUs/shaders (VLIW design) that run at a relatively low frequency clock (typically 1120-3200 ALUs at 625-900 MHz), whereas Nvidia's microarchitecture consists of fewer more complex ALUs and tries to compensate with a higher shader clock (typically 448-1024 ALUs at 1150-1544 MHz). Because of this VLIW vs. non-VLIW difference, Nvidia uses up more square millimeters of die space per ALU, hence can pack fewer of them per chip, and they hit the frequency wall sooner than AMD which prevents them from increasing the clock high enough to match or surpass AMD's performance. This translates to a raw ALU performance advantage for AMD:
    * AMD Radeon HD 6990: 3072 ALUs x 830 MHz = 2550 billion 32-bit instruction per second
    * Nvidia GTX 590: 1024 ALUs x 1214 MHz = 1243 billion 32-bit instruction per second
This approximate 2x-3x performance difference exists across the entire range of AMD and Nvidia GPUs. It is noticeably visible in all ALU-bound GPGPU workloads such as Bitcoin, password bruteforcers, etc.
Secondly, another difference favoring Bitcoin mining on AMD GPUs instead of Nvidia's is that the mining algorithm is based on SHA-256, which makes heavy use of the 32-bit integer right rotate operation. This operation can be implemented as a single hardware instruction on AMD GPUs, but requires three separate hardware instructions to be emulated on Nvidia GPUs (2 shifts + 1 add). This alone gives AMD another 1.7x performance advantage (~1900 instructions instead of ~3250 to execute the SHA-256 compression function).
Combined together, these 2 factors make AMD GPUs overall 3x-5x faster when mining Bitcoins.

Again, no one knows the future, maybe tomorrow the world will end, but we don't know, all we can do is calculate reasonably based on current data.
Difficulty has decreased twice in the past, there's no reason to expect it to go up forever. The recent difficulty adjustments has shown to be very slight increases, it's pretty stable right now. I can reasonably expect that difficulty will still be well under 2.5M in 3 month, unless price goes drastically up, which would make mining a lot more profitable anyway.

Just use phoenix miner and set aggression=3 or less, so your display core activity stay below 80%. Your computer is crashing because you are using your display core 100% with mining, this will crash the display core almost immediately if you use it for any other purpose.

Datacenter are far more expensive than running the 20GH/s at home, no datacenter is just going to allow you to run 20KW of extra electricity+space for 20 rigs, without any justification for free, unless you own it.
At the current difficulty, 20GH/s gets you roughly 20 BTC a day, which is $400/day, $12000 USD per month. But difficulty will increase by roughly 30-50% every 14 days, so realistically you are looking at about $9000 for the first month, $6000 for the second month, $3000 for the third month. (Assuming BTC value stays at around $20, it could go up to $30 or go down to $10 as we saw in the past week). So after 3 month, your would still not make the money back yet (which is normal, you can still sell your equipment at this point and make a hefty profit). 
Is mining viable? yes. profitable? yes if you have patience. But make your money back in a month? dream on

One of the attractive features of bitcoin (and namecoin), is ownership. You own the coins(names), no one can take it away from you when properly secured, BUT you must be responsible for them (ie. learning and researching ways to keep your coins safe). There will be no one to bail you out either.

If you had a keylogger successfully ran on your local PC, then all is already lost, you have been defeated. Adequate security measures would not have allowed the keylogger to run at all. (router firewall+software firewall+software AV/Trojan protection+Win7 UAC+possibly run in a VM). 
If you are for some reason unable to implement adequate security measures. Then just run your bitcoin related business off a liveCD environment.

How to get your free bitcoin:
1. sign up with tradehill and use my coupon code TH-R1313 (10% off your commision at tradehill for life).
2. make at least 1 trade, and post here your trade date and time.
3. post your bitcoin receiving address
4. I will send you 0.01 free bitcoin
Tradehill advantages:
1. Much lower commission charge than mtgox!
2. Same amount of funding options as mtgox
3. Huge selection of withdrawing options, and fast withdrawal (I already tested this, withdrew $300 to dwolla and it happened in matter of minutes).
4. More professional site and contact options
5. Balancing mtgox's power over the btc network. One person holding too much power over btc exchange is no good.

for mtgox, it's less of a problem, because their fee was quite high, they can swallow the small loss, mtgox used to make $6000/day before the hacking incident. (1M monthly btc volume, at 1.3% fee, is 13000 btc per month, which is roughly $180,000 per month pure profit or $6000 per day). 
Remember the 0.65% fee is charged to both the buyer and seller, so for a single trade, the fee is in fact 1.3%

I think hackers might have already secretly gotten their hands on mtgox database and are just doing the cracking on their local machine. Especially if they own some bitcoin mining rigs, it's trivial to crack a 8 character password. Mtgox account hacked posts are popping up almost hourly, I wonder whose account is up next to be cracked. The recent DDoS attacks against mtgox are probably just a diversion, so the mtgox admins are busy dealing with DDoS and won't notice the intrusion

they are not using stolen bank accounts. They are using their own bank accounts to transfer money to dwolla, then to tradehill, bought a bunch of BTC, moved them out, and then claim to their bank that the dwolla transfer was fraudulent, then their bank reverse the funds from dwolla. Dwolla then reverse the funds from tradehill. Tradehill ends up short $37000
