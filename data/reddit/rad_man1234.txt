I agree, and did the same as a coding challenge. But the question I'm trying to get at is not about guessing the private key, bit the random number that is generated and used alongside the private key to sign transactions and if the technique is mathematically possible

Thanks, can you recommend any more reading about this information? Trying to find it specifically about the PRNG, but when searched it talks about it in context of creating the private key, not the signing key.
So the signing key is any number generated but doesn't specifically have to meet and requirements, or are there requirements such as min or max length ?

As I commented on another reply, I'm asking about the mathematics behind it, not what the probability is of finding a collision

Not stressed, but am trying to find out if it is technically possible or just a maths backdoor (ie no way of going backwards).
Purely from a numbers point of view not a physically possible view

Not exactly, more that can we brute force guessing the number? 
As an example say the signature R is given as 15.
In the equation R = (random number) * G
Then it would be 15= random number * G
As we know G and R, can the random number be guessed until the result matches that of the given R value. 
I've read over that post a couple times, but am still lost as to which random number is used where. 
This comes from looking at how people can find the private key if the same random number is used to sign 2 transactions, which result in the R value being the same. Except instead of finding the private key using 2 transactions, the random number is guessed and then using that the private key can be found of any address aslong as it has an output already
