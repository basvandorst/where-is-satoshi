you know nothing about china law. there is no interpretation, and there is no case to follow. Whatever leader calls is the law.

thanks for the insights.
for me, the more i put money on it, the more i want to understand how the politics work in this community. if one day, btc is really controlled by big miners or even bankers, it's not good for any one of us i can say for sure. but right now, it's really unclear who's really behind this.

lol nice
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:34:47
thank you! nice links.
Another question, what kind of process it will go through regarding making big decisions?
@_date: 2018-01-20 03:12:53
you used mainnet? i so does this mean anyone can start using LN now?
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:41:23
i see. I heard lots stories about bch people been forced out of btc community. It's bad news and I'd like to understand how they work together to make btc better instead of fighting on conflicts and sabotage each other

is this really the first physical good transaction thru LN? if so, you are gonna be as famous as the pizza guy. congrats.

can you please help this one, this had been stuck for a week:
Thanks in advance! happy holidays.

I see. So it must be exact same amount,right? with 8 digits after decimal.
Do you recommend me to wait until 2 weeks? Or I can resend anytime now?  Thanks so much!
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:34:25
come on man, no one want to waste too much money on transaction. let's be honest.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:20:20
I see. this sounds tricky and makes me nervous. :D
For example. last time I sent 0.12345678 BTC and due to low fee, it's pending.
I have another 0.5 in my wallet. 
Should I now send 0.62345678 to same address now? and It will invalidate the old pending one? and I will be safe if I don't use this wallet anymore.

thank you for all your replies.
