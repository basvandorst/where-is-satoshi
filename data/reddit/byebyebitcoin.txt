$0.1165/KwH is quite a low electricity cost. Its well below the world average I believe. Even those mining calculators use $0.15 as default.
The cheapest price for residential electricity in America is $0.07-$0.08/KwH, which doesnt make any significant difference to the conclusions.
Mining profitability depends not just on difficulty, but on the price. If we see the downtrend continue, and fall into a low lull for an extended period of time, then miners will suffer.
Thus a sudden price fall could trigger a great deal of miners to suddenly turn off their machines. Anyone familiar with mining knows that when this happens, the time to mine blocks shoots up until there is a difficulty target recalculation.
Here's my thoughts here: There are only about two dozen types of ASIC miners. When the price falls below a certain level, it could cause all miners using one of those types to switch off pretty much all at once. Most ASIC miners have similar profitability anyway. This sudden decrease in hash rate would bring the network to a standstill, at least for 2016 blocks - or two weeks - which is the time between difficult retargets. It would also make the network vulnerable to things like 51% attacks.

That would be stargazing while the world is falling down around you.
If the Bitcoin price doesn't increase rapidly very soon (fat chance!), then miners are going to stop mining and the Bitcoin network will become very vulnerable and possibly cease to function properly.
This is an immediate concern that will resolve itself one way or the other in the next few months.
