Total garbage. Honestly perplexed as to why CCN posts stuff like this. A banker who thinks bitcoin will never recover. Yawn. Consider the source.

Write up the bill of sale in BTC instead of USD. Provide buyer with your bitcoin address and make sure the transaction is verified on the network. Do it all face-to-face.

A family member of mine just received one to login to their Coinbase account. Be safe out there!

Its been rough. I bought around $14k and fell for the hodl meme. After losing more $ for what seemed like everyday decline, not to mention some poor swing trading decisions, I finally sold back to fiat around $9.1k. Here we are at $6.6k. I told myself I will either re-enter at what I believe is a reasonable price, or walk away from the market entirely. I have yet to re-enter the market.

Whatever you do, don’t panic sell if/when you experience your first flash crash.

I often see traders mention strong support levels (e.g. $6.5k, $6.2k, $5.8k, ...). Where do they pull that information from? The order book on an exchange like Binance?

You are right. Looks like their pricing model changed at some point.

I sold overnight. Was 100% BTC holdings. BTC is up 85% in 3 months and almost hit 60% market dominance. I’ll look to re-enter at ~$5,600. I try to sell when everyone else is buying and vice versa. Time will tell whether it was the right move. Obviously I get some trades right and others wrong.

You were right about clearing $8k
