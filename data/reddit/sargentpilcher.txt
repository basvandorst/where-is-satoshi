1B marketcap for bitcoin is a whole new world from a 1B marketcap today. Every coin in the top 40 has a 1B market cap.

I can't predict the future, but if you think history will repeat itself, have a look
Don't invest more than you can afford to lose, and you'll be a happy camper.
edit: In the function of supply and demand, the supply essentially gets cut in half. Currently every 10 minutes when a bitcoin block is mined, 12.5 bitcoin are awarded to miners. Miners HAVE to sell a decent portion of these coins to cover their electricity costs, so millions of dollars are required to be spent on bitcoin just to keep the price level. After the halvening, the amount of coins being dumped on the market daily will be reduced to 6.25, causing a supply shock.

You make a LOT of good points, and to be honest I don’t disagree with any of them, but I view the results as less catastrophic. So let’s assume every single unnecessary job is erased. McDonalds, retail workers, a high percentage of Manafacturing minus what the robots can do, and I STILL feel the economy would function. It may take time to adapt and it would be different, but would it be worse? I don’t know. Standard of living would have to be adjusted. People would have to buy older cars, and maybe even do their own repairs so there goes mechanic jobs as well. 
But will people in general be worse off? I’m still not convinced. Maybe population would start deflating as well. 
Edit: Also, whether or not it helps the economy, is it moral to “steal” people’s savings from them?

I don't quite the opposite. I think that bitcoin in it's current state is no bettr than digital gold therefore "only" worth 8 trillion. Once it advances technologically more, it will be worth significantly more than 8 trillion.

When was there ever real news? I'm a millenial, so I don't think I ever saw it, but Clinton in the 90's signed the new telecoms act into law, allowing 6 companies to own 90% of all media in the country. It's not exclusive to one side, or time period. There has always been fake news.
I remember one situation of an investigative news team doing investigations into bovine growth hormone, and having a segment and episode on it. The station scrubbed the episode and put in some lies above the investigators heads, they blew the whistle, all got fired, went to court, judge ruled "It's not illegal to lie on the news". 
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:48:02
I think those are all good points, and I am not saying I think you're wrong, but is there anything to back any of it up? I mean, maybe high savings would lead to slower and more natural growth?

I get your point, but I completely disagree. It may take a big event to unfold, and to be perfectly honest it may not even happen in our lifetimes, but I am 100% convinced we are in the biggest bubble this world has ever seen, but bitcoin isn't it. 
I'm a US citizen, and we are 20 Trillion$ in debt, and climbing. This is an unsustainable amount. All that needs to happen is enough countries going off the dollar as a world reserve currency for all those dollars to flood into the US and for hyper-inflation to occur, possibly combined with another cataclysmic event that triggers the entire thing to crumble down. 
Countries may turn to gold, but how do we know how much gold each country has and if its true what they have in reserves? Has a fort knox audit ever been made public the amount of gold the united states has? 
Bitcoin, in it's current crippled state, is more valuable than Gold in my personal non expert valuation. Once bitcoin gets upgraded in transaction speed, then adoption will increase exponentially. 
Theoretically speaking, if bitcoin survived long enough, and the US dollars decreased another 90% in value over the next 100 years like it did the last 100 years, a billion dollar bitcoin is not unreasonable and that is without any added adoption. That is purely from the dollar being devalued right from underneath the people.
An alternative has never existed to this framework that has been forced down our throats since birth. This is not a fad that will go away. The emperor has no clothes, and it's only a matter of time before word spreads.

I think this is an interesting point, but let me flip it on its head because I have been searching and cannot find a single instance of a country that has embraced deflation the way we have imbraced inflation. 
I am responding to this quote particularly
"Deflation on the other hand freezes economies. Imagine you bought a house a year ago on a 100 bitcoin loan, now the price of bitcoin has jumped and you have no way to pay back. The super rich hoard money already, even with inflation. Imagine how bad it would get if they could just put their money into a vault and have it appreciate instead of having to invest it back into the economy."
However, the inverse of this is not true, so why would this be true? What I mean is, if you borrow money from a bank, you should theoretically be making out like a bandit, because the money you borrowed becomes less and less valuable over time, making it easier to pay back. Of course they cannot allow things to work like this, and they add an interest rate so they are sure they make their profit back. 
So in a deflationary economy, it would theoretically work the same way, except the interest rate on a home loan would be a negative interest rate, presumably smaller than the rate of deflation. I don't see why every other function of an economy wouldn't also work exactly the same, except things getting "cheaper" as the money deflated instead of things getting more "expensive" due to inflation.
I am no economist, but I have heard nothing but bad things about deflation, which led me to be curious why. But there has never been a society that we know of that embraced deflationary policy openly. For example, maybe in a deflationary economy, savings would be very high instead of debt. Maybe people would save up for houses and buy them outright instead of signing over 30 years of their life, which inflates the price of housing far beyond its true value, because you have people willing to spend such insane amounts. Perhaps housing costs would come down? Perhaps deflation is a good thing?

I think what he is saying is that the dollar WOULD work that exact same way (Someone being born after you needing money) if the supply of dollars was limited. But the way the current situation is that the banks print more for themselves, so THEY make the interest that you would have otherwise been earning in a deflationary system. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:31:08
I find this all hard to believe and the more I hear it, the more I realize it’s backed up by nothing. Never in the recorded history of the world has a society actively sought to achieve deflation, so we have no idea if it would be worse or better. I’m not personally making either claim, just saying nobody knows if deflation would be bad.
The example you gave of your money doubling in value is obviously dangerous, just like it would be dangerous if you lost half the value over a year to inflation. But reality is inflation of about 4% a year, so why would a deflationary rate of 4% a year be bad? Is anybody SERIOUSLY not going to buy that car they need to get around, so they can save a couple hundred bucks? No. It would encourage saving instead of debt. For all we know it could revitalize our economy. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:44:21
Technically possible, but in my (admittedly worthless) opinion it will continue to go up until the market becomes over saturated. That is until there are no more people who see utility in it. 
For example, it has a LOT of technical hurdles to overcome before it reaches mainstream adoption, in particular scalability. My argument is that gold doesn't scale either. There's a reason paper money was invented, because gold sucks. It's easy to steal,  and fake. Very difficult to divide, and transport. 
If you look at bitcoins insane transaction fees more like a digital gold than a digital cash, then it still not only provides utility better than gold (Harder to fake and harder to steal. Easy to divide, and transport), then bitcoin in it's current state is still worth 8 trillion (Gold market cap) in my (admittedly worthless) opinion. 
Then if you look at bitcoin as something that can be upgraded over time as it is simply a software protocol, then the sky is not the limit. The moon is not the limit. The universe is the limit. 
I do not see bitcoin having a "serious" bubble pop until it overtakes gold at the very least. By serious meaning a pop that effects the price to such an extent that they do not recover for years, as per your example of why can't it go down in 2018? Technically it can, but as long as they keep making improvements, I do not see that happening. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:00:05
I see many of your points, but I believe this has always been the case, but only exacerbated by the internet and current viewing habits. There's the joke about the newspaper owner being informed he's running his business at a loss to which he responds "I guess I'll only be able to run it for another 100 years then!" as newspapers have always been useful as influential tools, and not always as profit makers.

We are all made of stars. Your statement about a horse only being able to be forged in a super nova, are quite literally true. Gold is actually not rare at all in the universe (or even earth, except most is unreachable). I can tell you for certain that there is FAR more gold in the universe than something as incredible as a horse, which not only took the same necessary ingredients from a star that gold needed, but it also over billions upon billions of years of struggle and death, and survival of the fittest, so the planet could evolve an intelligent form of life strong enough to carry a man on it's back, and for man to come along and tame it. A horse is infinitely more rare and special than a rock. The rock only has the value that is given to it by society, which can change at any moment the society changes (Just like the magnificent horse did when we invented the car).

There's enough plausable deniability to it if you had enough of a plan attached to it. All transactions are recorded on the blockchain so a government will definitely be able to find out that you bought bitcoin and have used it, but if you transfer everything to a new wallet, then who's to say it wasn't all stolen? How could they prove that you have the new seed words memorized and are awaiting release, or aquital.

What attributes of the left do you associate with bitcoin? There’s no black and white when it comes to politics, just a whole lot of grey. 
Stereotypical views of left wing politics would be social programs to help the least powerful amongst us, and fighting for workers rights and a minimum wage. Both of these examples require a larger governing central authority in order to put this into practice. Bitcoin is the polar opposite of a central governing authority, which is why it attracts a lot of libertarians. To be honest with you, the more I learned about bitcoin, the more I turned from a socialist perspective (ex-Bernie sanders supporter) to a libertarian supporter. I’d always been a fan of Ron Paul’s audit the fed movement, even as a socialist and it took me too long to see how the two were related.

If electricity and internet go down across the entire world, it's likely due to some form of worldwide nuclear holocaust, where if you even survive at all, finding gold to trade will be the LEAST of your worries. 
They don't use gold in the walking dead do they? (I know it's a show, but it's so impractical that they didn't even include it). There is a LOT more to wealth than gold, or dollars. Knowledge is wealth. Shelter is wealth. Safety and protection is wealth. Weapons are wealth. Tools are wealth. Food is wealth. Clean water is wealth. These are the forms of wealth an apocolpytic society will be concerned about. Not some shiny rocks. Not 1's and 0's in an online database either.

@_date: 2017-08-14 01:27:53
I disagree that a huge crisis would send it to 0. I mean, you may see people trying to sell their BTC, but if anything it will become more valuable than ever if the dollar or the US govt becomes insolvent. I mean, unless that huge crisis was like nuclear war or something then yeah I guess if we're all dead then we'd go to 0. 
I guess I'm curious what you meant by huge crisis as I see a huge crisis as sending BTC to the moon. The bigger the crisis, the more valuable BTC becomes.

i honestly dont mind the idea of taxes if theyre for public benefit, but our tax dollars are squandered on bullshit bailouts and wars.
there should be a system in place where each person chooses how their tax dollars are spent, whether for roads, or school systems, and which school. Much like Trumps idea of charter schools where you get a certificate that can be spent at any school. They should apply the same principle to roads, city halls, street lights, sanitation, and military.

I want to thank you for sharing this valuable experience with us. This kind of thing could happen to anybody and should be held as a warning sign to the rest of us. It may not help but what's done is done so don't beat yourself up too bad. At least you still have 200 btc, which if you HODL those will one day be worth a fuck ton, and will easily replace what you lost over the next 10 years. Hell, maybe even some of the alts will come back. 
On the opposite side, I have done very well with alts, but it's probably just dumb luck. I am a small time investor and only have 1,000 usd invested, but currently my portfolio is valued at 1,600$ because my investments in alts have outpaced my btc investment. I must have bought low. I got 4 shares of ant shares at 7$ and now they're worth 50$ each, so I'm stoked I made 170$ profit (until it crashes). But you still have a fuck ton more than I do!

Get a wallet that is capable of "seeing" it, and then transfer it to an exchange. Be careful though as I think there's some exploit where if you open up your BCH, theres some kind of thing that allows them to "double dip" into your BTC as well. There's a name for it that escapes me at the moment. Just do some research and take the proper precautions. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:48:09
That is a very good point, but that doesn't mean that one day it won't hit 4,000$. It just means it needs a market cap 10x the size, which one day is very plausible. Maybe 10-20 years away, but that's why we HODL in the first place.

This is the origins of HODL. A guy who is bad at doing day trading, and realized the ONLY 100% winning strategy is to play long term. If you buy at 3,500 they're still going to profit huge when it hits 100,000

I agree about btc price going up, but disagree about alts. While many are pump and dumps, many more are potentially further disruptive innovation in their industries.

Bitcoin is a brand that uses blockchain, but there will be LOTS of competition just waiting for Bitcoin to fuck up, which over a long enough period of time is inevitable.

I think part of the difficulty is US finance laws.

It's a great meme, but I see the prices being connected and complimentary more than anything. Btc is rising now, but as soon as the price flattens out for a little while, the alts will be cheaper in comparison, and people will pump the alts with their new btc gains, hoping for some alt gains.

That's so hard to time. I bought at 2,700$ and then it fell to 1,900 but I HODLed through it all. When was the right time to sell? When it hit 2,500$? What if it stopped dropping there and went back up? Should I have sold at 2,700$? What if it continued to rise? Should I have sold at 1,900$ in case it went to 1,500$? There's no right answer. The only answer is to always buy, all the time, and you'll win out, which so far I'm up 500$ per bitcoin. (I only have 0.2 bitcoins so I'm up 100$)

I think it's a valid question to ask, but I don't think their ideal global currency would include open source and democracy. Their hubris would never allow it. I think they would force it down our throats like the euro or something similar. 
If we really consider Bitcoin as a psy op, what is their end game for it? We can see the code. If they change it we can go to a new coin. If it's ever hijacked for any reason theres nothing stopping us from using a different coin in its place. 
Given that, I personally don't think it is a psy-op, and like you said even if it was, would that make me stop investing in it? I don't think so lol.

The way I look at it is this. What is going to last longer? A) A worldwide decentralized currency that can be run from anywhere in the world with an internet connection off of a 30$ raspberry pi, and a satellite dish? Or B) The US government with 20 trillion in debt and climbing, who already incarcerates more people in prison than "communist" china? 
It might not happen in our lifetimes, but IMO bitcoin is gonna outlast the US government, and any government that does make it illegal. You can't kill an idea. Once the first book was printed on the printing press there was no going back. 
@_date: 2019-12-19 16:55:16
“Do we account for that in literally any other type of graph?”
Then why are you trying to use the same logic for something that doesn’t have the same properties? Stocks are finite supply from the beginning with the exception of inflation, but I’ve never heard of stocks being “burned” or “locked up” or even, “we will sell lots at first and then fewer and fewer will be sold” as a company strategy to increase price. 
“There's no real precedent for a future known reduction in an input like that.”
Sure there is. It’s called the halving. It’s happened twice.
Just look at the history of bitcoin. All this talk of users going down and less money coming in has happened before.... until the halving. Now maybe the halving destroys the price further which I’ll accept as a possibility, but ignoring it is just stupid.

Yes, the USA could ban bitcoin, but if they do, we have MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH bigger problems than bitcoin price dropping. We will officially be living in a fascist country no better than china, just plebes doing the bidding of the gatekeepers, while those at the top will just keep printing money and devaluing the currency. Which only means that some other country that fully embraces bitcoin, like japan, will thrive, and in the long term when hyper inflation happens, and we have 50% unemployment, japan will take over as the  world superpower.
It would be the stupidest thing in the world for the US to ban it, but that doesn't mean it won't happen.

I admittedly didn't know about stock lockups, so there is precedent, though I would doubt it's on the same scale or level as bitcoin.
"Becomes like watching a team win, then putting on your special jersey, watching them win twice more and saying 'must be the jersey' . You get pretty close to Lisa's Tiger repelling rock."
I disagree because the halving is based on solid economic fundamentals of supply and demand. Under a reduction of supply, the ONLY thing that can decrease the price is a significant reduction in demand. Assuming demand stays the same, which is reasonable, but debatable, price is going to rise.
"Also the concept of 'until the halving' is dumb too, both halvings happened in the middle of 1 year+ bull markets anyway, it's not like price was dropping before the halving and it changed...it was going up both times already and just continued up."
You don't think it could have to do with the fact that people KNOW the halving is coming?

These things WILL happen. In every which way. The bubble is gonna pop, and people will never come back. I'm pretty new to this stuff, but after 6 months I've learned to call them "weak hands". The people who buy at the all time home, then sell at the first dip.
I bought at 3,000$, and it dipped to 1,800$ but I heard a wonderful philosophy known as HODL. Just because there's speculators that cause wild fluctuations in price doesn't change any of the world changing fundamentals of the technology that are fueling the price rise in the first place.
That is to say there are still only ever going to be 21 million bitcoins. You can still "be your own bank", and cross borders with the memorized keys in your head travelling to any country without threat of confiscation. 
We are still a far cry from the inevitable "bitcoin mania" that will eventually happen, and will fuel the whole thing burning to the ground before it rises again like a phoenix. Through it all but one word. HODL

There isn’t inherently anything wrong with banks. The problem is the government protections afforded to them. For example, the idea of a corporation is a creation of government to privatize profits and socialize losses. Before the invention of the corporation, bank owners were personally liable for going out of business, so they made much more conservative investments. I would argue it’s perfectly safe to leave your crypto on an exchange that’s insured. That being said, I don’t leave anything on exchanges. Not your keys, not your bitcoin.

You make 2 VERY good points about bitcoins current situation. But do not mistake for a second that they are not fixable. When I first had internet, it was on a 14k modem, over phone lines. Soon that improved all the way up to 56k. Then? People saw that there was value in the internet and started creating infrastructure specifically tailored for the internet, using new technologies like DSL, and cable, and even 3g, and 4g, and LTE wireless internet technologies. Businesses saw a demand, and the free market rushed to fill it, because people's eyes were filled with dollar signs. 
So your first proposition is like saying that the internet would never surpass the 14k modem. Yet here we are with fiber connections and streaming 4k television over wireless connections in our laptops and cell phones. How far do you think bitcoin will go in 20 years?
Your second proposition is like saying that the internet would fail because it relied on phone service. Yet here are today with voice being transmitted over internet infrastructure, instead of the other way around. Yes, centralized exchanges are a current and required first step to adoption. There will need to be a cultural shift in people's attitudes as the space grows. To take over the proposition of being your own bank. Not everybody will want to be, so there will still be demand for centralized services, which will always be a weakpoint. I don't see any way around it though. If you are an educated investor and know the reasons you shouldn't leave large amounts on exchanges, then you won't be effected by any fractional reserve practices. It at least gives you the option to protect yourself.

People get excited about the symptoms of success. But NONE of the foundations have changed. It's just going to take more time to get there. It could take 10-20 years even. I don't even know if bitcoin will be the champion of the coming currency war, but I can tell you with 100% certainty it will NOT be the US Dollar. I'm certainly not going to sell my bitcoin for that. Perhaps another currency, but NOT USD, under ANY circumstances would I want to invst in a shitcoin, that may be stable, but it's stable on a DOWNward trajectory, so it's honestly one of the most retarted value propositions I can imagine. "It's safe, because at least you KNOW it gets devalued between 2-8% per year!"

You honestly, truly, think it will hit 0$? There is no way. Even in the even of Ethereum taking over bitcoin, and bitcoin slowly fading into the distance, it will still not hit 0$. It may lose 90% of it's value, but it will not go to 0$. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:22:12
They invest it because if they left it in the dollar it would go to 0. The dollar has lost 90% of it's value over the last 100 years. That's a clear trend that will likely repeat. Eventually buying bitcoin will be like buying gold. The stable currency. Until we hit a market cap of several trillion, it won't be stable.

The definition of a currency is a very loose one. Gold is a currency. Bitcoin is a currency. The dollar is a currency. There is no way to seperate money from greed. There is no way to seperate humanity from greed. It is a natural human emotion, and as long as we are here on planet earth, it is something we should accept, and work to avoid. Are you saying that gold and the dollar has not been corrupted with greed? Because I would disagree, and say all 3 are corrupted with greed.

You put up a strawman argument that we pay bitcoin miners 2 billion a year in miner revenue, which is a fraction of Visa's 10 billion, as if Visa was the only thing it's competing with. Don't forget Bank of America, Chase, and every big bank in existence who charges 10$ a month for a checking account, as well as overdraft fees, interest rates, etc. For that 2 billion a year, bitcoin is replacing closer to 100 billion$ worth of dinosaur business practices. 
Any argument about "what gives bitcoin value?" also applies to dollars, and gold, yet don't see you saying "what is this piece of paper? Why does it have value?". There could definitely be a philosophical discussion of "what is money" and there is a good piece from aristotle on just the subject. Several "conditions of money" exist within bitcoin, but not all. 
Miners only need Fiat, for the same reason we needed to use modems with phone lines when we first started with the internet. Eventually, we used different cables which were better for internet bandwidth, and now we can transmit voice over the internet, instead of the internet over lines meant for voice. Bitcoin will only need dollars, until one day, dollars will need bitcoin. 
The 1800BTC a month (Until it halves) is a completely arbitrary number. Bitcoin is divisible. You may as well be saying that miners are paid in billions of satoshi's. What difference does it make? If there were twice as many bitcoins available, they would be worth half as much. 
Edit: Let's say for arguments sake, that the USA made bitcoin illegal. It would be no more effective than had the church banned the printing press. One day the church won't be in power, and will no longer be able to hold back innovation. How much longer can the United States Government remain solvent with 20 trillion in debt? There will eventually come a point in time, when we can't repay our debts, and we won't have to because we have the biggest guns, but people won't want to let us borrow anymore, and if we want to keep certain programs, we will need to print more money, which will lead to inflation making more people crave something like bitcoin, and the government won't be able to keep it illegal, as it won't be financially feasable to lock everybody up. Similar to alcohol and marijuana reforms. Bitcoin, or something like it is inevitable. The cat is out of the bag, and it's not going back in. There will be stumbling blocks, cliffs, potholes, and bears in the road, but nothing is going to stop it completely, any more than book burning stopped people from reading.

1) "It is not really infinite". Sure one could make the argument that infinite is a number that doesn't truly exist, but in relative terms it is indeed infinite, unless you have a better word to describe stacks of hundred trillion dollar bills printed by Zimbabwe.
2) Outside of a nuclear holocaust, there isn't truly a way to "wipe out" all the assets. If I were a corrupt government who printed 100 trillion dollar bills, then that isn't wiping out the value of a house that remained constant in its utility through the process. The house is now worth quadrillions of dollars instead of hundreds of thousands. The asset never changed. If I provide labor and accept a wage of 20$ an hour, then the value of my labor never changed. The dollar did. I am now making 1 trillion dollars an hour. As long as there are goods and services being required, the market will find a way to value them, based on basic economic principles like supply and demand. I completely agree with you about how terrible this would effect people with pensions, and social security, and fixed income in general. It would effect them very badly, just like the US governments inflation does. 
3) Yes, it will be chaos. The Roman empire fell into chaos. Empires fall. There is no reason to think the same won't happen to America. 
4) "Go starve he said". Outside of the government forcing you into a career path like the soviet union did, the government can't command somebody to starve for not wanting to give him money. As long as the person has something of value to trade, the market will pay him for it in whatever the market decides. If his labor is valued in food, then he will be paid in food, and will not starve, assuming he is willing to work for it. Wealth is created through work and effort. Extraction of resources, and turning what was once a bunch of trees, into shelter. Where was there was no value, value has now been created, without the need for a government. (Uh oh, where am I going to get the dollars to cut these trees down? The government won't give me any so I guess I'm screwed.) 
5) Our system WAS the best system in the world, up until January 3rd, 2009. Now our system has to prove that it's the best system in the world through competition with all the other systems that are now free to exist.

I'd like to assume that somebody like satoshi would have gone to enough trouble to conceal his identity enough to protect himself, but maybe it's wishful thinking. I don't think bitcoin would necessarily be any better off if he were still a part of the development team. 
Like, if you're saying that bitcoin cash never would have happened if satoshi were still here to keep the community together, then you're right, but we would have had somebody else trying to do the same thing instead, for a different reason, with a similar result regardless.

Bitcoin can fall to 100$, but unless it is due to a competing crypto currency, or massive failure upon bitcoins behalf, then it will go back up. I think that's unlikely in the next decade at least, because if bitcoin goes down, so does everything else. Bitcoin IS crypto currency right now.

Fiat is simply the terms we have to live in currently. When bitcoin is worth a million per BTC, you won't have to trade it into fiat to live large, because in order for that price to be justified, adoption would have to be so high that you can spend it anywhere.

It's not right. The dollar has lost 90% of its value since central banking started in 1914, and I don't see any reason for it not to drop another 90% over the next 100 years.

What debt or spending are you talking about? What is to justify their expenditures? Tax, I understand, as it goes to funding our government. What is the justification for inflation of currency? How is inflation of currency not outright theft? 
Money arose in the free market LONG before government came around and mandated a currency. Long before the roman empire was there to create government coins, people who traded back and forth noticed that some things had higher demand as others. For example, if you were a shoemaker and you needed wood, but the person selling wood didn't want shoes, then what are you supposed to do? A 3rd item that was in higher demand (Salt for example) became the go between. That meant that the shoe maker was happy to sell his shoes for salt, because he knew that salt was in a high enough demand, that he could take the salt, and trade it for wood. Thus a currency was born without the need for a government. 
Day 1 of country: Where do the dollars come from? From the value that every man, and woman provided in their goods and services. It sure as hell didn't come from the government saying something had value. The dollar was initially a paper certificate certifying that amount in gold in a bank vault. But since Nixon that has not been the case.

You're absolutely right, but you'd have to be stupid to give your bitcoin to somebody else to keep. Part of the appeal of bitcoin is to "be your own bank".

You put up a strawman argument that we pay bitcoin miners 2 billion a year in miner revenue, which is a fraction of Visa's 10 billion, as if Visa was the only thing it's competing with. Don't forget Bank of America, Chase, and every big bank in existence who charges 10$ a month for a checking account, as well as overdraft fees, interest rates, etc. For that 2 billion a year, bitcoin is replacing closer to 100 billion$ worth of dinosaur business practices. 
Any argument about "what gives bitcoin value?" also applies to dollars, and gold, yet don't see you saying "what is this piece of paper? Why does it have value?". There could definitely be a philosophical discussion of "what is money" and there is a good piece from aristotle on just the subject. Several "conditions of money" exist within bitcoin, but not all. 
Miners only need Fiat, for the same reason we needed to use modems with phone lines when we first started with the internet. Eventually, we used different cables which were better for internet bandwidth, and now we can transmit voice over the internet, instead of the internet over lines meant for voice. Bitcoin will only need dollars, until one day, dollars will need bitcoin. 
The 1800BTC a month (Until it halves) is a completely arbitrary number. Bitcoin is divisible. You may as well be saying that miners are paid in billions of satoshi's. What difference does it make? If there were twice as many bitcoins available, they would be worth half as much. 
Edit: Let's say for arguments sake, that the USA made bitcoin illegal. It would be no more effective than had the church banned the printing press. One day the church won't be in power, and will no longer be able to hold back innovation. How much longer can the United States Government remain solvent with 20 trillion in debt? There will eventually come a point in time, when we can't repay our debts, and we won't have to because we have the biggest guns, but people won't want to let us borrow anymore, and if we want to keep certain programs, we will need to print more money, which will lead to inflation making more people crave something like bitcoin, and the government won't be able to keep it illegal, as it won't be financially feasable to lock everybody up. Similar to alcohol and marijuana reforms. Bitcoin, or something like it is inevitable. The cat is out of the bag, and it's not going back in. There will be stumbling blocks, cliffs, potholes, and bears in the road, but nothing is going to stop it completely, any more than book burning stopped people from reading.

It works like any market. The more sellers there are, the cheaper the price. The more buyers there are, the more expensive the price. 
There's 900 new bitcoins created every day, so many of those hit the markets, on top of investors and day traders. But that's a very limited supply, with more and more buyers coming in all the time. So the price will continually increase until it reaches mass adoption, at which point the price will become much more steady as fewer and fewer new people join in for the ride.

I for one am hodling because I believe in bitcoin. I believe that it can handle any attack thrown at it, from hackers, to making it illegal to trade in. None of those things can stop it. You would have to shut down the internet to stop it, and if that happens, we will have far bigger problems than lack of access to our bitcoin. These things are merely roadblocks. But bitcoin is freedom from government, and corporation alike. It is quite literally a money of the people, by the people, and for the people, as it's open source. Bitcoin is beautiful.

I completely disagree. In my opinion it's the dollar that has no chance at surviving the next 100 years. The US Government is 20 trillion dollars in debt, and effectively underwater/insolvent. We are all just happily chugging along like nothing, but sooner or later the leaks in the damn are going to become larger and unmanageable. 
The ability to issue debt and create currency is not at ALL an essential, OR neccessary part of an interconnected global economy. That idea is completely false. Bitcoin is capped at 21 million units, but it's divisible to 8 decimal places, and can be divided further if required. There is absolutely nothing stopping businesses from freely doing business with each other with crypto. The only thing that will be effected in a negative way is the ability to get in debt. It will be harder to create money out of thin air and get somebody in debt. I do not see this as a bad thing.

Banks are stuck in a gilded cage, as they cannot get rid of all their inefficiencies. They cannot fully get rid of brick and mortar banking as there will always be a need to speak to an actual person for larger bank transactions and identity verification. Even in the fantasy land of 100% Bitcoin adoption there will be Bitcoin banks with employees to help people through and even process loans of Bitcoin. The only difference being no need for a billionaire CEO at the top as their business is no longer going to be creating the same amount of value.
Getting rid of unneeded human jobs and positions will be no worse for the world economy than using machines in agriculture, or automobiles instead of horses, or digital cameras instead of film. Those people will now be able to go do something meaningful instead of working in finance. 
Bitcoin mining is proportional to the value of the currency. Mining could theoretically be done by a single computer (it was for the entire first year) but that single computer would be the point of failure, and at today's prices that single computer would be making 5 million usd a day. The fact that Bitcoin is in high demand means there is competition for the bitcoins being created, which creates the large Bitcoin mining mobs. That computing power is not required to run the Bitcoin transactions, but it is meant to secure the network, as the more people mining, the harder it is to perform a 51% attack (one of bitcoins biggest weaknesses). So it is well worth the energy costs, and will follow the laws of economics. If energy becomes more expensive, then the profit margin for mining will become smaller and fewer will do it. 
Altcoins don't devalue Bitcoin anymore than coca cola cherry devalues coca cola. It's not a "doubling" of coins. It's part of the protocol. I can make a fork of Bitcoin and create my own hard fork. Will it be worth money? Absolutely not 
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:14:21
You have it completely backwards. Forgive me for assuming, but what I think you are doing is getting me to say "the government". But that is not true in the slightest. The original government issued dollar currency, on day 1 of the united states dollar issuance, was a paper currency backed by gold. Something that had value assigned to it by the market. What the government did was take that over by force, and threat of imprisonment. The government did not provide any value. They just took over what the market decided had value. 
Day 1 of an economy will not function by government decree alone if the market rejects it. The market must accept its use first. In your case, the government is doing it by force, which is immoral, wrong, corrupt, and counter productive to the function that money is supposed to serve.

Not to mention amazon has survived the "bubble", which was really just speculation into future profits. The funny thing with bitcoin, is that a bubble will only make it more valuable if more people jump onboard due to the network effect. 
I just looked it up, and according to this article  at the height of the dot com bubble, amazon was valued at 36 billion dollars. And now according to this article  amazon is now valued at 450 billion dollars, and it's not a bubble.

You make a good point. What would Bitcoins value be if nuclear war happened? Zero. But as long as civilization continues its growth, with economic and population on a never ending increase for the last 50,000 years, I see no reason for it to end with Bitcoin. 
The more people there are to trade Bitcoin, the more valuable it will be. In order for Bitcoin to lose value, there would need to be a catastrophe decreasing the population of the earth. Outside of that, the supply of Bitcoin will become scarcer and scarcer as the population of the planet becomes larger and larger, increasing competition for Bitcoin, driving the price up.

1) Completely agree. There was no foundational wealth with which to leverage the printing of money, which didn't truly change the value of anything. The government essentially stole the money from people who had saved money, instead of buying real assets. 
2) Yes, for the most part physical assets, but bitcoin is not a physical asset, yet it is still finite. The fact that it is finite, alone, gives it value. What is the point in acruing something that will become worth less over time?
3) Yes, agreed, a bully will force you to use whatever points they want you to use. Currently our bully (Well, I'm american, so my bully at least) is the united states government. They have done nothing more than hijack the wealth that belongs to the country and stolen it for themselves. Where at one point you could exchange your money for silver in a bank, they have gone off that standard and said "This money must only exist in your imagination". Their plot worked, the economy went onwards, and they have been printing with glee ever since. This is the first time in our country's history that there has been a possibility in creating an alternative. It is no longer an issue of "Am I allowed to?", but an issue of "Who is going to stop me?". The government cannot stop the use of something. It has never been succesful. Prohibition was a failure, of alcohol, and marijuana. Drugs still exist, and one can buy them in a multitude of ways today, not because governments have allowed it, but because the market has shown a demand, and the market fills the demand. Government can outlaw bitcoin and force you to use their currency, but that will not stop people from using bitcoin. 
If I have a choice of who's points I want to play by, then I'm going with the one who is most fair.

You make a good point. What would Bitcoins value be if nuclear war happened? Zero. But as long as civilization continues its growth, with economic and population on a never ending increase for the last 50,000 years, I see no reason for it to end with Bitcoin. 
The more people there are to trade Bitcoin, the more valuable it will be. In order for Bitcoin to lose value, there would need to be a catastrophe decreasing the population of the earth. Outside of that, the supply of Bitcoin will become scarcer and scarcer as the population of the planet becomes larger and larger, increasing competition for Bitcoin, driving the price up.
The current crash is not due to a failure with bitcoin. It is a necessary speed bump. It was overvalued, but will return to equilibrium over time.

Until I see otherwise. Of course the unforseen can happen. I don't claim to be an expert of crypto's. I say it's open source, yet I cannot understand the code. I trust that if there were problems then others will have found them by now. 
Never say never is correct, as it could happen to bitcoin. But it would literally take HUGE unfixable problems to make anybody go for a different coin. Maybe some internal sabotage, or complete lack of development, but all of the problems of bitcoin are actively being worked on right now. So anything that gets thrown at it, has a solution. The growing pains involved are in finding those solutions. It would take something crippling to make anybody want to jump ship to something with potentially the same problems.

Gold is a good and bad analogy in that yes there is a finite supply of gold on planet earth. One day however we will discover asteroid mining and the value of gold will plummet. Maybe we will even find some cold fusion method to bring the alchemists dream to life and actually find a way to manufacture it. 
Bitcoin cash is NOT in any way Bitcoin, any more than Pepsi is coca cola. More forks can be created but there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins. Anything that has more will not be a Bitcoin. Forking Bitcoin doesn't make the value that Bitcoin offers go up or down, but only psychologically in the heads of any buyers who decide that it is worth more, or any altcoin is worth more. 
Nobody likes being replaced with the next generation, I'm not trying to make it sound like "too bad bank analysts, you're worthless now", but the fact of the matter is that they are worthless now.

I wasn't trying to insult you, but the fact that you seem so focused on the value of the dollar in comparison to bitcoin implies that the focus is not on the entire world.
First off, there are not 1.2 trillion dollars in existence. In cash, yes, but in bank accounts, it's closer to 10 trillion dollars (  )
And this is JUST 1 country, that has a 2-3% rate of inflation (for now) that they tell us about. Over the span of 20 years, inflation alone will make the total dollar supply in the world 20 trillion. The entire global money supply is valued at 60 trillion (All currencies combined) )  ) Now all bitcoin needs to do is become the new global currency used (Which may or may not happen), and if it can achieve this, then 1 million per coin is not far fetched at all. It's not going to happen overnight, and any number of things could prevent bitcoin from reaching its potential, from government intervention, to competition taking bitcoins market share. Maybe it will be the cryptocurrency market total will be 20 trillion, and bitcoin will be 10 trillion. There are a lot of variables, but as long as bitcoin can survive, it's not crazy to think bitcoin will have a market cap of 20 trillion in our lifetimes. I give it 20 years.

You do realize that bitcoin is a worldwide currency don't you? To top it off, add in inflation, population increases, and time to grow, and 1 bitcoin could reach 2-5 million per coin if it doesn't die before it can reach that point. All it has to do to get there is survive.

No, tell me why I'm wrong instead of an ad hominem about lala land. That's not an argument. Tell me why I'm wrong. 
I am saying the value is derived from the marketplace consisting of goods and services. Value is not derived from what the government dictates it to be, outside of their uncontrolled printing of it. 
I need to buy bread, but where did the breadmaker get their equipment from? Their supplies? How was the wheat grown? Did the bread magically appear in their shop for me to spend dollars on it? Maybe the government dictated that there be bread for fear of throwing the bread into prison? It didn't work so well for the soviet union. 
How do you value how many dollars a loaf of bread is worth on day 1 of this economy? Taxes will always be a percentage of what is earned in the market.

value is relative. Purchasing power is what we should really be looking at. Let's say a 100$ toaster oven that you want to buy. In an inflationary system, after a year that toaster oven will cost 105$. In a deflationary system that toaster will cost 95$. Did the toaster change? Did the amount of work that went into making the toaster change? Did the labor costs change? The toaster oven is no different in a deflationary or inflationary system, as the purchasing power in all 3 scenario's is the same. 
So in my example, the 95$ that was paid back, had the same purchasing power as 100$ did a year ago, as the purchasing power of the deflationary dollar increases. In our current system, the toaster oven would now cost 105$, and the loan we got from the bank has a positive interest rate, because the purchasing power of the dollar is decreasing. 
It's all arbitrary. There is nothing inherently good or bad in either system. Inflationary systems encourage debt and deficit spending, while deflationary system encourage saving. Too much of either is bad.

@_date: 2018-04-18 18:27:04
Because it wouldn't. If deflation was at -7%, then making a loan at -5% would make you profitable.
Let's say a bank makes a loan of 100$ at -5% interest, they will end up paying back 95$, when that 100$ would otherwise be "worth" 93$ after deflation. That is 93$ today, and 100$ from a year prior would have the same purchasing power. But whoever took this loan paid back 95$, and thus the loan was profitable. 
It's a little confusing because we're not used to it, but it's 100% arbitrary.

"3.79 million Bitcoin are already destroyed" 
So this will drive prices up as the supply is lessened. It's not that big a deal. 
"On top of that you also have people dumping and pumping the cryptocurrency lowering its value." 
Yes, it's an unregulated market. People do this same behavior with stocks, and real estate, and just about anything one can invest money in. This is not unique to bitcoin. 
"At some point it coins going to be worth nothing."
According to....... you? And what's your evidence, or your reasoning as to why that is? 
"And I just hate for it to be promoted is this amazing thing that's supposed to replace the dollar."
Why? What makes you so loyal to the dollar? Why shouldn't it be promoted as a dollar destroyer? Actually to be honest, the dollar doesn't need bitcoin to destroy it. The dollar will destroy itself all on its own, and bitcoin will be there as an alternative. Why is this a bad thing? Monopolies are bad aren't they? Why should the dollar have a monopoly on currency? 
"It has no value accept what people give it"
Welcome to planet earth. This applies to literally every single thing you can imagine, from your car, to your house, to gold, to the dollar, to bitcoin. 
"it isn't backed by any Central Authority"
Correct, as any central authority can be corrupted. Central authority is nothing but a monarchy where the elite and those close to them are the ones who benefit. Decentralized authority is significantly harder to corrupt. 
"while that is appealing to some that also me and said it's largely unstable and open to corruption."
Are you trying to say that centralized authorities are not unstable and open to corruption? I don't mean to assume your age, but how familiar are you with the 2008 financial crash? 
"I'm not saying that coin is worthless obviously it has potential I just think that people are going to ruin it."
How can anybody ruin it? Nobody controls it, so no single individual can possibly ruin it. If it gets ruined, then it will be because we all ruined it together.

I figured worst case I would claim ignorance, or hell just pay whatever I would owe. I am a pretty low income individual, and 800$ (The amount I would have owed) is a lot of money to me, and represented a large portion of my crypto that I didn't feel was fair to be taken from me considering I never made the switch to cash, at which point I would have openly accepted taxes. Billionaires go through loopholes EXACTLY like this all the time. The difference there is that they have lawyers to defend them.

Well, I was hoping actually to buy 5$ here 5$ there, but if it's better to buy big chunks then I'll buy 100$ here and 100$ there.

oh really? How big are the fees for single transactions? Bitcoin has always fascinated me and I want to get started, but don't have 1,000$. I can't use it like a bank account?
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:00:15
Ah VERY interesting! Thank you for your explanations that makes sense. It would also explain why you can't use a bitcoin miner to mine for litecoin, and other altcoins. They seem to be specific. Thank you!
@_date: 2017-07-28 02:34:40
I've heard electrum thrown around so it's what i'm using. It allows you access to the private keys, which is the key that will be accessable on both networks.

What would changing the proof of work accomplish? 
@_date: 2017-07-29 22:59:49
In what way? It's run by a group of developers. It's an idea that a group of people believe in whose success is dependent upon the product they create. It may not technically be a company but it's just symantics. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 21:34:28
Holy shit, I'm a newb and never heard about this. In a way it makes me feel better about being such a latecomer to the platform as apparently early on there were some kinks that needed to be worked out still. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 00:37:51
I could absolutely see trillionaire bankers who view bitcoin as a threat to their wealth wanting to do this. I think there should be some kind of plan for it, as to me it's not a question of "if" but "when" it happens. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 00:03:21
Ok, very interesting. what are the arguments against segwit then? I've heard that it's only a bandaid solution as it doesn't increase the block size all that much. Even if it's doubled, it's only a matter of time until it needs to be doubled again, then again. Is it like "We'll worry about it when we need to" kinda like this was? 
@_date: 2017-07-16 16:39:11
As somebody who has been wanting to get into bitcoin, let it fall! 
@_date: 2017-07-26 01:11:41
Great info! Thank you! I see a high amount of respect for the core bitcoin devteam. I'll take your word for it. Bitcoin to the moon! 
@_date: 2017-07-26 01:13:17
Hmm that's an interesting point. The bigger bitcoin gets, the harder it would be to get a 51% share. That makes sense. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 01:13:50
That just so happens to be exactly who I would suspect would want to take down bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 16:45:15
isn't 1/1000th of a bitcoin called a millibit? Granted that's thousands, but surely one could divide into 1/1,000,000th but I don't know what it would be called. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 23:47:46
Whoa I'd never heard of a bitcoin ATM! That sounds perfect! Thank you. I just googled it and there's one near me too. It looks like they charge a little higher than market rate, but I guess that's the price of business. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 02:43:43
Ok GOOD info to have! I happn to have a spare computer that I can use as an offline unit if my bitcoin amount ever gets high enough to warrant it. Thank you!
@_date: 2017-07-26 00:25:06
Ok, very interesting. It's something I could definitely see happening.
@_date: 2017-07-26 14:44:46
I was trying to tell my uncle about bitcoin, but he started telling me that it's a scam, and you people are just trying to take my money
@_date: 2017-07-28 06:06:29
What would you call it? 
@_date: 2017-07-15 01:59:22
I just wanted to ask you another question that just finishd bouncing around in my subconscious. I never thought about how to protect my bitcoin. I imagine it is susceptible to all sort of modern hacking techniques that I am not even aware of. 
So is that a thing? Having a "safe" computer? Like, how far do I have to go to be safe? Do I need an offline computer? Dumb printer meaning somebody couldn't hack it to steal the images being printed? Do I need to take it that far? Are there horror stories out there? 
@_date: 2017-07-26 05:10:45
All this talk is making me want to invest more and more into it. It's seemingly indestructible! But like you said, anything is possible. I just foresee some cataclysmic event happening. False flag maybe, but the government going so far as to shut down the internet. Which I guess wouldn't actually stop bitcoin worldwide even. Whatever they try to do there will be a response. Very fascinating. I love this new game changing innovative shit. It's always what changes the world. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 07:25:44
So there's nothing to the claims about segwit adding potential for fraud? 
@_date: 2017-07-24 01:38:18
Could I pick your brain a little about private keys? I very much want to be prepared for the split (even though I'm a smalltime sub-coin investor). Currently I have a bitpay wallet on my iphone. Do I control the private keys in that environment? Or do I need to buy an offline bitcoin wallet in order to hold the private key? 
@_date: 2017-07-23 22:07:22
Oh wow ok, I was thinking of them more like banks. So should I regularly offload my coin into a home wallet? Currently I have about 0.07 BTC in bitpay on my iphone, and about 10$ on gemini.com so I'm not gonna lose a ton of money yet. So you're saying I should offload it from gemini, but is my bitpay wallet a safe enough place for them? Until my phone gets lost or stolen at least. 
Is it free for me to transfer between wallets? 
@_date: 2017-07-15 02:51:34
Ok for sure! That's a little out of my price range right now, but it looks awesome! I hope to have some money coming in soon which I would like to keep safe with bitcoin, which is what put me down this path in the first place. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 00:24:46
dump your coins at a hugely reduced value though, if anything at all. What could the coredev do to update against it? If there was a solution to this problem, then wouldn't they have fixed it? 
@_date: 2017-07-29 17:06:35
unfortunately, like the internet, there is no "investing in the internet" only "investing in companies that use the intrnet". Just like there is no "investing in blockchain" only investing in companies that use blockchain. Maybe bitcoin will be the most succesful, maybe not. Right now things are looking good, but anything could happen. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 02:51:30
I know this was a while ago, but I would be VERY interested in this!
@_date: 2017-07-26 01:19:20
Wow it sounds like it's already had some attempts to be taken down and they have been unsuccesful. That's a relief. I'm new to the space and am just researching. I want to know its weaknesses to know my risks involved with investing. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 06:07:24
Does bit pay give you access to private keys? 
Electrum also shows you fiat $$
@_date: 2017-07-25 23:30:43
I've heard that segwit has problems though. I am not a technical person in any shape of the word. I'm new to the bitcoin space, so I could be wrong. But according to this rather long video  the guy talks about how segwit has potential for fraud as it allows segregation of the blockchain and not EVERYBODY has to see it's been verified, so you have the possibility of rogue miners with lots of power doing some shady things. Which will according to him over the long devalue it as a currency. 
I haven't seen much negative talk of segwit outside of that video, but I would really like to know both sides of the story. Like 2 passionate, knowledgable people duking it out on this subreddit.

You don’t think an in between could happen? That is to say, the internet and electricity exist in Venezuela, so why wouldn’t it if the dollar crashed? You think everybody will just go out of business?

Not after taxes if you’re in the US you wouldn’t

it depends on the reason for the recession.
@_date: 2019-05-25 06:16:03
I disagree completely! A nation states dream??? To not have any control over it??? As if bitcoins transparency was a flaw? It’s a feature.

I thought a halving took 4 years?
@_date: 2019-05-01 22:22:40
That's purely relative. Although you could argue that bitcoin is more rare than gold in the universe once humans start asteroid mining. That extra gold won't be indicative of greater wealth, it will just make the value of gold less, relative to everything else.
@_date: 2017-07-27 22:27:32
I'm gonna guess that's what the pattern has been. Lots of rises, and then "crashes" to an amount that is higher than it was. This cycle has repeated since it was valued at .25 cents. 
@_date: 2018-12-21 15:18:13
But 18 plus 18 is 36 making it 3 years. I’m confused 
@_date: 2019-05-01 21:35:15
I've been trying to make the argument that bitcoin improves on gold in 4 essential ways.
1) Bitcoin is easier to store than gold
2) Bitcoin is easier to transport than gold
3) Bitcoin is easier to divide than gold
4) Bitcoin is easier to verify than gold 
Over a long enough of a time span, this utility will win out in my opinion. I have nothing against gold though, and is still a perfectly valid thing to back currency by, but until we can remove the state from the equation that's not gonna happen.

Ok, but I can identify them too. It goes both ways.

VERY interesting. Didn't know the controversy with bitcoin and KYC (Just googled it), and it's fascinating! This is exactly what I was looking for. I'm just dipping my foot in the waters now, and wasn't too concerned with the privacy aspect so had no problems with the KYC rules put in place at coinbase and glidera, but I got seriously pissed off at my ID and Passport getting denied so many times. I took so many pictures. I was locked out of their system for too many attempts. I'm like, I just want some fuckin' bitcoin, not put a hit on somebody.

This is a story as old as time. Sony thought the ipod was a dumb idea because even after the ipod was released and destroyed the walkmans market share, you know what sony did? rerelease the walkman!
