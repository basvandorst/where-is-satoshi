I'm not so sure about that. Let's say you bought some BTC at $100/BTC, then later you transferred it to a different wallet and paid a 0.001 BTC miner fee when 1 BTC was worth $2,000. You received a service worth $2.00 using an asset that you only paid $0.10 for, so that might count as a $1.90 gain. I'm not a tax professional, though.

Hi Eric. I've heard about this, but I'm curious: Aside from the automation, what would be the difference between being paid in bitcoin and simply buying bitcoin with my earnings?
Presumably, someone's bank transfers money to an exchange for this to work. Whose bank does that?
@_date: 2014-01-22 17:54:32
No, according to [post]( your gains become realized (taxable) when you exchange the bitcoin for other goods.
Edit: Unless the IRS decides to treat bitcoin as a foreign currency, but apparently there's been no decision either way, IIRC.

The point of bitcoin is that you can send *bitcoin* to anyone. There's no guarantee he or she will be able to convert it to fiat.

1. People often say that one of the advantages of Bitcoin is that nobody will be able to print more of it after a certain point. But what guarantee is there of that? Couldn't someone release a new client that just starts generating more BTC? If the mining guilds colluded to use this new client, couldn't they change the rules?
2. Do any of the offline wallet generators like brainwallet.org provide an easy way of submitting transactions? It seems like you'd want them to be able to generate a transaction, then display a QR code you could scan with an online device, which would submit that transaction to the Bitcoin network. But I don't see that functionality in brainwallet.org.

I wasn't able to find the forum they're talking about, but I found an official blog post about a whitepaper that mentions digital currencies. It doesn't mention Bitcoin by name, though.

I've recently seen some posts and comments saying that the blockchain with the most accumulated difficulty isn't necessarily the one that should be called Bitcoin. But isn't the chain that has the majority of the hashing power the most secure one (or, given a large enough majority, the only secure one)?
For example, if 90% of miners switched to the NYA branch, and the difficulty of the Core branch then dropped to 10% of its previous value, wouldn't that make it possible for NYA mining pools to devote some of their hashrate to wreaking havoc on the Core branch by mining sequences of empty blocks to replace slightly shorter sequences of Core blocks that have already been mined? Is there a good way to defend against this kind of attack?
Granted, the miners have other incentives, like mining the chain that gives them the best return. But if they were determined to destroy the Core branch, that would outweigh shorter-term market-based incentives, right?
Or are the miners who are signaling NYA not necessarily organized enough or determined enough to carry out an attack like this?

Yeah, `scrot` grabs my screen more accurately, too. Shame it can't output to stdout, but oh well.
This also works:
    scrot -se 'zbarimg "$f"; rm "$f"'
`scrot`'s default output filename contains the word `scrot` and a timestamp with seconds, so it's probably good enough. (Another way of generating a safe temporary filename would be to use the `tempfile` command, if you still want to do that.) The `rm` can be included in the `-e` option, which automatically means `rm` is only executed if `scrot` succeeds at creating an image, so `&amp;&amp;` isn't necessary. And `rm` should run whether or not `zbarimg` is able to find a QR code, so we can use `;` here. The `$f` should be in double quotes just in case the filename contains a space, although it probably won't.
By the way, this still works if you leave off the `-s` switch. `zbarimg` will just find all the QR codes on your screen. I guess you wouldn't know which one is which, though, unless the order is easily predictable from the size and/or position of the QR codes on the screen.

    $ import screenshot.png
This will save the clipped area to `screenshot.png` in the current directory.
In my case, doing so revealed that `import` was sampling my screen in a strange way. Some windows that were supposed to be minimized were included in the screenshot as if they were in front of the barcode I was trying to capture. This was with ImageMagick 6.7.7-10 2013-09-10 Q16 on Ubuntu 13.04. I haven't found a solution yet.
