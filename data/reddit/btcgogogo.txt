international transfers are not $10-30. 
They also take 5+ business days which is insanely long compared to bitcoin

You just need to wait for the transaction to either confirm or be returned to your wallet after some days. Your other option is CPFP (child pays for parent) transaction to speed up your confirmation time. Look it up.

Lots of rambling.
Bcash isn't better than bitcoin. A block size increase isn't a long term solution it is a short term band aid. 2nd layer solutions like LN are long term solutions. 
And nobody is forcing you to hold bitcoin. If you are unsatisfied and feeling the fud then by all means sell your btc. Someone will be happy to buy it from you. Just don't complain when you get rekt and have to buy back higher in the future.

THIS people. If I'm going to be storing a lot of con a hardware wallet I want it to be as open source as possible and a $100 price difference is not going to sway my opinion on that. End of discussion. Trezor also has a better track record since they have been around longer.
That being said I own both and keep 90% of my coins in my trezor and 10% in my ledger.

Twitch! Twitch.tv is a HUGE livestreaming platform used mostly by millennials to watch their favorite streamers play online games. You can subscribe to streamers to show your support to them for $5 a month, or some people like to donate $ to show their support. Online games and bitcoin tend to go well together. They should really add bitcoin support to their platform. I tweet  all the time asking.

It's actually not fake, bitcoin Black Friday has been a real thing for the 3-4 years with the exception of last year. Last year was a dud. 
But it's basically businesses around the world that offer discounts on their products for Black Friday if you decide to pay with bitcoin. Just a fun event for bitcoiners :) hopefully it happens this year.

If there's a civil war/nuclear war/world war,  bitcoin gives you the ability to pack up and leave the country within the hour if you really wanted to and continue your life in a safe country like nothing ever happened. You will still be able to transact with your btc anywhere in the world with no issues. Good luck moving your real estate/stocks/usd (if 10k+) / gold bars with you across the world without lots of delays and tons of transportation fees/legal hoops to jump through. Most people that don't own bitcoin are unable to  make changes like that. So...just think about that and it will help give you an idea of what the demand for bitcoin would be in situations like that.

This is not true. It is possible to buy $5 a week and not suffer from the fees. Op can buy as much as he would like per week on coinbase, and hold it there until he reaches $100 let's say. Then transfer the btc to his own personal wallet every $100.

I have 95% btc, 2.5% ltc, 2.5% eth. It depends how much risk you want to take. I believe in btc as a store of value and feel more comfortable keeping the majority of my $ there as it has proven itself over the years. 
As long as you have majority in bitcoin you will be fine.

@_date: 2017-11-11 13:41:46
Think about it like this.. large holders (10-50k+ bitcoin) that received an equivalent amount of bitcoin cash in august are unable to sell a significant portion of their bitcoin cash without absolutely destroying the price. You can be sure they want their free $ from bch too (just like the rest of us were able to sell bch for more bitcoin, or whoever wanted to), not to hold some worthless shitcoin you can't buy anything with. And this is the only way they can cash in their bch. They have more than enough money to perform these pump and dumps, and get people involved emotionally to buy at the top. Every cycle they are able to offload 10-30%~ of their bch on noobs that don't know any better and leave them holding the bag. In January, coinbase is releasing 500k bitcoin cash to their customers which will absolutely crash the price. So I'm not surprised we are seeing another pump and dump cycle before then. Also xapo and other big businesses will be releasing their bch to their customers some time next year. We will probably see another pump cycle before that too
Due to cryptos unregulated nature there are currently no laws preventing these pump and dumps and manipulating people emotionally from
It's important to remember the people behind bitcoin cash are:
Roger ver- the guy that claimed mt gox was solvent and told everyone not to worry when they were in fact insolvent.
Craig wright- the man that has been pretending to be the creator of bitcoin for the past year and is known to be a huge con artist.

You should consider upgrading to a segwit wallet. Fees are way less. Before this past week I was sending with 1 dollar fee or less for fast confirms 
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:46:31
I've never had to pay more than $10 fee. And the only time I ever paid $10 was over this past weekend. Otherwise it's usually $1-2. And I've never had to wait longer than 10-25 min for confirmation. 
You probably have a ton of inputs.
Have you tried upgrading to a segwit address? I'm able to send btc for high priority confirmation for much much cheaper than when I use a non segwit address. 
Lightning network will fix all of this too

A lot of the accounts complain about $100 fees (lies ofc) are very clearly sock puppet accounts. Many of those accounts have been created months or years ago and have absolutely no post or comment history besides complaining about transaction fees on bitcoin. It's been proven roger ver has paid for thousands of sock puppet accounts on Reddit and bitcointalk over the past couple years to help further his agenda (first bitcoin classic, then bitcoin unlimited, and now bcash) I'm sure mods do their best to filter out the sock puppets from the real users. It's also a minority of the posts you mention being deleted, not a majority, imo. I still see a good amount of posts asking about tx fees that don't get deleted. 
Also: tx fees are reasonable this week, big businesses are starting to integrate segwit starting with bitfinex any day now, and progress is being made with lightning network every single day! (Check jack mallers twitter if you don't believe me) what's there to complain about ??
 
Have some patience :)

Core isn't against scaling. Core is against a rushed 2 month hardfork to scale because it can be extremely risky and may have severe consequences if something is coded wrong etc. Their main priority is security and making sure things are done right. And as a bitcoin user I agree with them. A "safe" hardfork to upgrade to 2mb or more would take 6-12 months to prepare + test thoroughly etc.

bitcoin is nowhere near the same thing as winning the lottery. 
If you took the time to research bitcoin you would understand that buying some is a +EV gamble (I'm not talking about price movements, strictly the technology and what it's capable of.)
Buying a lottery ticket is a -EV gamble.

Sentiment changes fast. It's best to stay away from reddit in times like these. Go enjoy life and hodl (this is the first time im on Reddit this week). Understand the technology (which i assume you do) and you will understand bitcoin is designed to go up continuously in the long term due to the block halving etc. so there's nothing wrong with catching the knife as long as you understand what you're buying, believe in it, and plan to hold for the long term.

This... if the bitcoin price drops too much, mining just becomes more competitive. Those with the cheapest electricity will continue to reap the benefits. 
Bitcoin is not going to go to 0 because " if the price goes down too much all the miners will unplug their machines!"
