I put fucking 2k into their account 3 days before they went down. It just disappeared. Unbelievable.

Just talked to them on the phone in Japanese(I live in Japan and speak the language fluently). Here is what I have told them:
I wanted to know where my money went. They do not know and cannot answer specific questions that are tied to that.
I told them I put at least 2000$ in 2 days before their site went down.They said they do now know. However, they did take note of this part.
I asked if they wanted my name to go along with that information, they said no its ok no need.
It seemed like a waste of time so I ended it there. Seems like they are just trying to gather complaints. They also kept saying to monitor the Mount Gox homepage. If there are any question you would like for me to ask them please let me know below.

He is a Japanese friend. Just like a lot of people here in Japan they believed the exchange had cheap bitcoins. They are the ONLY exchange out there that handles JPY, so what choice did he have?
They accepted deposits the DAY BEFORE they shut down. :(

I just wanted to ask all you posters if you are from the US? I have had no problems with them, along with my colleagues that do business with them. They just NOW did buy/sale orders and executed fine. I have withdrew money from them here in Japan and ended up in my account 7 days later (mid Jan). 
Note: Colleagues are JPN with JPN bank accounts.
