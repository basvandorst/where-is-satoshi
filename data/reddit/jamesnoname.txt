Thanks. The few times I venture into here to learn more about bitcoin, or rarely, to comment on anything, I always sense a great deal of hostility. I think it is because bitcoin is still a boat that is relatively easy to rock and most people are touchy about anything even slightly negative which might affect the value of their newfound wealth.

I tried mining on a regular desktop PC five years ago and after a few minutes it drew so much power the lights turned off.

Me too. I started getting into the idea five years ago but never really invested into it. I did play around with a mining program though, managed to mine, like, 9 cents worth (apparently worth around $50 today) which I no longer have access to (lost private keys). And then in the process my computer drew so much power the lights turned off.
Checking the price recently, I realized if I had invested only $100 in bitcoin back in the day I would have had $60k today. Bummer.

Unfortunately that doesn't work and according to Textnow's site Coinbase doesn't approve of VoIP numbers.

If only it was that easy...

Your profit is proportional to how much you own. If the price of one bitcoin goes up $100 USD, you profit $100 USD if you own one whole bitcoin. If you own half of one, you profit $50.
