As a video editor (at certain points in time) I’ve learned presentation is everything. Show final product with as view visual bugs as possible. Especially the error screen right after a successful demo

Right, for mass adoption you can’t be explaining how it saying it doesn’t work in your public posts. So back to emphasizing the speed. Makes sense, it’s off chain. Nice to see it live. Maybe a quick summarization of what’s happening and the difference between on chain and off chain and what means for you the individual using that atm.

I imagine it will hang around 5K. 4500 I’d jump on at this point but unless more dippage 3500-4K days are over. But at 5K, u’ll be smart when it’s back at 20K^moon

Bitcoin has fueled my desire for knowledge. Learning the tech reminds me of algebra. Having real world case uses, for a system the relies on responsible user base, in-turn teaching a community that had to be educated enough to get there and continue to educated to succeed. Hmm guess education is the root, decentralized markets are the new trees growing...

You threw me off there, people wanting food,hookers,drugs... buying tangible coins with your digital coins ha love it! Or bars. I hodl my silver like I hodl my bitcoin! Also great purchase at 20K... One might have heard to buy the dip, don’t forget to spend at the tip (on things that last longer than one evening)

1 Satoshi = 0.00000001 bitcoin. 100,000,000 Satoshi = 1 bitcoin. He has 2936076  Satoshi or 0.02936076 bitcoin. That fraction of bitcoin multiplied by the current price of bitcoin ( usd) = 146.80usd and at bitcoins ath (20K) that same fraction of BTC is worth 587.21usd. Thank you Satoshi Nakamoto

It’s stupidly delusional to think the non cooperative game theory structure of society will yield better results than a cooperative game theory structured society will

I agree it’s low, however it’s the nature of the internet. This needs to happen to improve systems. Charities can’t be slacking, they need to upgrade to something more secure and transparent. I wonder what solution could exist?

They are primarily scared of losing their own power... not so scared of evil doers, they prop them up but looks like there is a more honest way that’s efficient for legal markets now (hence attempting to make it illegal). They should pass a bill to change over government systems to run more efficiently with blockchain solutions. The money saved should kick back with tax cuts for the people not the corporations. How would it be to see where our military budget specifically goes each year...

My favorite word used was never. Do you hear yourself? Are you brutally honest with yourself? Further more do you not see how there are solutions for the people, you know humans, riding on us leveling up? All mass adoption means is that it’s a working trusted system, which we need, because... idk be brutally honest about current systems not predicting failures
@_date: 2018-12-02 03:15:43
Wall Street wishes it influenced crypto’s. They make crypto’s you can play with in the market... with more options. Not the other way around. The crypto whales know how to make money of squeezing the prices down, they manipulate the markets not Wall Street. Not even close. Moving on...
