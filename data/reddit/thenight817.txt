Anybody know of a good coin price tracking solution? Not a personal tracking solution, but a market tracking solution. Like a much more detailed version of coinmarketcap.com?  
I'd like to research some macro-level pricing trends. I'd like to see the timeline of any coin I want as well as export the data to CSV for more analysis.

US POWER GRAB:
Hello all, new bitcoin owner here.
With regards to the future of bitcoin and what greater adoption looks like, I have a viewpoint that adoption is a game of power. Essentially Bitcoin adoption is taking directly away from the power of US banks/institutions. US banks and institutions currently make the rules of the game. Under Bitcoin they don't.
For example, the big corporate interests (at least in the US) are very entrenched in the US dollar and making transactions nice and inefficient (aka profitable for them). Why in the hell would they ever let all that get pissed away for a new currency that they can't throttle/charge whatever they want to make transactions with? 
In a world where corporate interests &amp; politicians are buddy-buddy, how does Bitcoin NOT just get stone-walled at some point by US Gov't?

My thought is banks don't want this. They want to do everything as its more means for them to exploit the consumer. This Crypto/less power movement sounds very unprofitable for them. 
Giant bank X is worth $100b doing all the stuff it does today (like charging businesses $.30c for every transaction), but under new crypto setup their newly limited services they are only worth $10b now. Those debit card transaction fees are threatened via crypto movement.
They (could) fight the movement pretty hard, or join it in their own way?
