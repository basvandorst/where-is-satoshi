I am not sure but I guess you should be good either way. Check if everything is working and don’t open the wallet when using a browser. This makes it pretty safe I guess. Cheers!
@_date: 2018-01-07 09:28:46
ok I got it. Here is a nice page which explains it as well for anyone who is interested: 
@_date: 2018-01-07 08:53:03
This is gold man! Thank you so much. Are these steps the same when using a mac? (just using the mac the Version for gpg?)
@_date: 2018-01-07 13:25:27
I don't this they will ban Bitcoin, wouldn't make sense. That's like banning Social Media.
@_date: 2018-01-24 11:11:33
dude! That's a great idea. Let's do this!
@_date: 2018-01-24 12:05:20
this made me laugh. Thank you stranger
@_date: 2018-01-07 08:10:55
So just to make sure I got this right. I should download the version from here  and then just click install and thats it? Do I have to type in my seed when opening the new version or will it automatically verify everything?
@_date: 2018-01-07 08:30:07
Thanks man! Could you maybe point me in the right direction to learn how to use GPG in a proper way. I never done that before. I appreciated your help so much.

@_date: 2019-08-12 13:16:53
it takes longer though, SEPA payment takes 3-4 days sometimes even longer. With Bitcoin its a few minutes.
@_date: 2017-11-18 08:44:45
ok I will, thanks
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:46:20
all the time today....no worries
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:55:27
Same Here. Germany
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:15:57
Ok I will, thanks for that!
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:21:31
So iis it good practise to store them at Electrum for a Newbie?
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:50:40
same here...germany
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:35:50
Yeah I use Bank Transfer because it only takes 2 days sometimes even one and the fees are cheap. Maybe there are some banks which need 10 days. I guess credit cards are perfectly fine as well since the growth is bigger then the fees.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:18:46
No Worries.
@_date: 2017-11-22 10:02:24
I spit out my orange juice because I had to laugh so hard.
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:53:50
same to you!
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:44:17
that is really awesome man, thanks you so much!
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:32:54
ok great I will try that, I need to try to cancel the order from Ldger first haha Thanks mate!
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:31:28
So you don’t know what they are talking about as well? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:21:13
Hey there Bitcoin family! Can I create a hardware wallet which is so secure like the ones I can buy by myself? If not, which is the most safest option after a hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:56:04
ok just one last Question. Elextrum says it depends on the fees how long it takes a transaction to arrive. But where do I set the fees when I use an exchange?
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:12:06
Ok so why the FAQ says you need to do some computer security steps then? Sorry for asking so much I just don’t want to make a mistake. Thanks for your help 
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:18:28
I am using a Mac I will use a Software Wallet for now and maybe change later. Do you know if the feed with Ledger are cheaper the with software Wallets?
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:44:54
I just wanted to create a Account with coinbase, but they are asking for id. Is this legit? Why are they doing that?
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:52:31
No I dont, it is fine. I am just new to this and I was wondering if this is legit, thanks so much!
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:57:35
ok so how to set up bither then? Do I just type in the private key?
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:20:19
ok Thanks I will do that. I need to install Google Authentification on my mobile phone for this right?
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:27:32
So I can create it by myself right?
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:40:07
But that must be new, I signed up last week and it took 2 days for my first transfer to arrive. Do you know if this was always the case?
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:33:17
haha I will try it and see how long it takes, but your may be right. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:33:08
so I have to worry about this?
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:14:27
At the moment I have nothing, I thought about setting up the wallet first and then buying the bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:20:26
Thanks for this man, that really helps. So there is no way to create a Hardware Wallet on a USB Stick on my own like Ledger.
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:06:52
Hey there, thanks for the Help. So I will use Electrum then, if I send the bitcoins from coinbase to electrum, do I can see the private key then?
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:34:30
haha yeah but I think our Community don't like that, probably they are right, too much going on at the moment.
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:41:41
Its like hodl just without the o
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:45:35
I used SEPA I guessed it must be wire then. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:42:48
But I can't buy if I have not deposit any money or if I have not use my credit card. In my case it takes the bank 2 days and then I can buy. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 08:13:42
thanks! 
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:51:42
great, thanks for your help!
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:34:09
ok I will check that. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:54:08
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:42:53
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:32:20
ok perfect, thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:17:20
Ok Bit if I Like to do these steps anyway, where to learn how to do this
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:32:30
ok thanks
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:19:05
This Guy is pretty good, he was also recommended in the FAQ. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:08:10
Thanks for the help, so the transactions fees come up when I send Bitcoins to the wallet or when I send bitcoins FROM the wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:43:00
ok good point, thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:02:09
Will it not work if I just download Bitcoin Core?
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:20:06
Do guys mean that it takes 10 days to send money from you local bank to coinbase? I mean with a SEPA transfer?
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:31:22
ok is there a big difference between this and a hardware wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:38:44
maybe, I am sure they will work on that.
@_date: 2017-11-18 08:13:37
allright, that was fast haha. Thanks man! 
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:45:06
No no I dont wont to blame anyone I just wanted to know why people talk about 10 days because it took me 2. Coinbase is great.
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:46:29
ok so they talked about 10 days because they were using ACH. Thanks Know I get it haha
@_date: 2019-04-15 13:11:29
Thank you!
@_date: 2019-04-10 11:54:40

haha thanks!
@_date: 2018-03-28 18:13:55
This shows how big this thing is. Of course there were bad predictions as well and no one knows what Bitcoin will look like in 5 years, however bitcoin certainly has the potential to become one of the predictions which fits in this scheme.
@_date: 2018-03-12 18:12:31
so you think crypto is useless?
@_date: 2018-02-11 21:17:34
it is crazy when you think about how big this really is
@_date: 2018-02-10 15:02:59

Because it is updatable. Things often failed because they weren't.
@_date: 2017-10-13 10:51:04
But I mean just the process oh buying and selling. Isn't this a good time to buy? I feel like I miss something when I don't buy now. Being on hold could mean much money that wasn't earned, right?
