that's a good point.
For over a year I wanted to invest my money but I didnt know how and what to do. I tried to learn the stock market and it was just so confusing, to me bitcoin and block chain technology is easier to understand, but that is because of my newly acquired knowledge I have learn from uni over the past 2 years. 
Anyway my point is if you try to wait for the right time, you will never get anywhere.

I'm not sure if you can buy every week and only send to your wallet every month or two, so you reduce transactions costs. I guess it depends how the exchange holds the Bitcoin for you.
I've just started last week and that is my approach. I'm hoping if i buy once a week and only send to my wallet once a month it will only be one output to one input and not 4 outputs to 1 input. Looking how exchanges work (at least the one I use), I think it will be 1 output, to 1 input.

It's currently double taxed, once she. You purchase bit coins and once when you buy something. So it will still be taxed, just not twice

Yes because of their cheap groceries, which is just their own homebrand version of food, Woolworths and coles (the two big chains) has had to drop their prices because of the competition they were losing to Aldi. Some stuff is actually cheaper than years ago which is surprising.

I bitched out buying for months. I was to scared to put 500 in so I put $200 in on Monday. That 200$ has gone up to nearly $260.

As 2NRvS said, I might expand alittle on what he said. Most banks charge a 2% fee to change currency. If you do an international bank transfer it takes 5 days, alot can change in 5 days. You could have issues getting the money out. You might raise suspicion if you are constantly sending money out the USA and getting it back it, could trigger the anti money laundery act.
Most of the time the australian exchanges around 5% more expensive than the USA. Sometimes it is more because aussies love using round numbers when buying btc for some reason. It like someone is buying at 3100, so someone decides to go 3200 instead of something like 3101 or 3105 etc, thats when the spread is stupid.
I switch between independentreserve and btcmarkets, sometimes there is a $200 difference between the two, both aussie but btcmarkers only accepts poli pay, which isnt an issue if you but a decent ammount of btc as the 3.30 fee becomes a small percentage. Using the aussie exchanges you can transfer money close to instantlyusing Poli payments, otherwise it takes a day.
I know I talked about buying in USA and selling here but it is a pain in the ass, ive changed my stance on it, to much mucking around for a really small gain. We are here for the long run, will saving $50-100 make a difference in the long run.

Even if bitcoin does fail, I strongly believe that the technology it is built on top of (blockchain) is going to change the world. I've been learning up crypto currency over the past couple of weeks and I am fascinated with what blockchain technology can do.
It will be interesting to see what happens over the next 1-10 years with this technology. In Australia, I had a friend that worked at one of the main banks, she said their back end infrastructure is over 15 years old. I am not sure how true that is, but I do see the cashiers working on very old computers that seem to be using a command line interface.
It is 2017 and it takes a bank 5 days to transfer money overseas and 2 days to transfer money between banks. What a joke. If it is true about their ancient back end and they say they can't upgrade because it would cost too much money, yet they pull billions of dollars in profit every year. I am keen to see what happens when crypto currency starts giving the big banks competition, maybe they will have to lift their game.
While I study, I work in retail. The place I work at, used to be one of the best and biggest grocery retailers in Australia, 10 years ago there was really only 2 main players in the grocery retail space, the big two had a monopoly over the market. Aldi came in and disrupted the system, and gave the big two had to adapt and lift they had to lift their game up.
I feel like bitcoin is kinda like Aldi, something which will disrupt the system that society is based on. It will be interesting to see what happens over the next couple of years. I don't like our current system, so I am all for the mayhem that could happen.

I don't know if it's the limited amount of volume we do but people are liking round numbers. When I look at the USA exchanges people my undercut someone by 1 cent or a dollar. Here someone might be on the buybook for $3201, next person is impatient and does 3300, driving the price up. I always match what the majority is buying at and get my coins for around $200 off market price, normally within an hour.
The arbitage is getting bad. 10% difference between us and Australia market. I wonder if someone could be manipulating the market.

I agree with you. I was reading something once on how to become an expert on the share market. It went something like this.
"I email 50000 people telling them I am a stock exchange expert and can predict what will happen in the future. Every week I email half saying it is going to go up, and the other half it will go down. So for the half that I was incorrect for, I remove from my mailing list. I do this for 12 weeks, and after 12 weeks I can email 25 people saying I predicted the stock market for 12 weeks straight"
I kinda think the same thing here. At the end of the day it is either going to go up or down. Seeing how strong the returns have been over the last 2 months, it was going to crash sooner or later.

The australian  market has gone up around 10% today, hovering around 3100-3200 AUD, afew hours ago it was 2900-3000. will be interesting to see if this is the new floor or if it will crash again. 
Tomorrow i'm meant to put money in for my DCA strategy.

I wonder what the FBI did with the bitcoin. They said they "seized 144,000 bitcoins, worth $28.5 million" which is just under 200 a coin. A quick google suggest they were auctioned. I'm sure they probably don't care about 300 million seeing they probably get heaps of money from the government.

I consider it both for a new to investing like myself. Going up a few percent a day isn't sustainable so it had to correct it self. To be honest I'd be happy with a 10% gain a year. I knew it was going crash but I became impatient, if I stuck to my original cost average method I wouldn't of screwed myself over.

Only started this week so I got a long way to go ;). All the best for you, I hope we all make it and get some wealth.

that is my issue now. I was originally going to only put in $100 a week and hold that 100%. This week I have been doing deep analysis of two bitcoin markets and I realised I could either buy on one exchange, sell on another with minimal risk and a gain of around 2-3% profit, or even hold for a day and push the gain to 5-10% profit. I have noticed trends in Australia that the price tends to drop at night time, out time and will generally go up slowly during the day, and slowly go down during the night, and the cycle repeat. While 2-3% doesn't sound like match, if you do it with a few thousand dollars, it adds up quickly.
I was going to originally flip that bitcoin I bought yesterday but sometimes I think why bother. I bought it for 3400  in the morning, could of sold it at the same time on another exchange for 3600 or even 3820 at night, then reinvest today using the same technique.
I was reading about someone who was doing something similar and he said if he held the bitcoin, he would of ended up slightly better off, with no effort. I guess thats the risk you take. By my calculations I could make $500-1000 week fairly easy, fairly low risk by using arbitage. For some reason, Australia has a 5% surchange. I can buy from the US without getting slugged the 2% foreign exchange fee and sell locally for a fee of less than 2%. But at the same time I could hold this 1 bitcoin, in the same amount of time, if it doubles I make the same amount of money without any effort.

I don't think it will ever be worth zero because of the black market.

It wasn't a crash, it was a one day 40% sale.
@_date: 2017-05-28 04:38:58
Gone up 7% since my last post. I don't know if it's the limited supply in australia causing it. We seem to have around 5% arbitage fee compared to the USA.
