Great! 
Go explain that to the 95% of the population who still has no idea what a bitcoin is.

What is life, but only assumptions?

All politics aside, that's the point. Although the few people understand and believe in bitcoin, and feel similar to you - bitcoin hasn't really seen any real-world applications. 
Price value doesn't always rely on just supply and demand, there are many other factors that determine whether something is valuable or not. And back to what you said about the fundamentals; there are significantly more people who still have no idea what a bitcoin is, what it's for, how it works, etc... 
I'm just trying to consider the possibility that there isn't really anything other than people fucking with the price - which made something go from nothing to $20k for no "reason". 
Not saying you're wrong, just looking at the other perspective

Bitcoin aside, I think this is a really good post to help people put their own self worth into perspective.

I think the Christians say the same thing about their god too.

I have one more question. 
Do you think you should pay taxes on your bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-06-21 22:53:38
I’m pretty sure that’s exactly the type of bull run you’ve been seeing since December

I just think it's an interesting perspective. There's a lot of people who think it's the value of bitcoin, use, and growth which is driving the price... but what if it's all being manipulated by someone else and none of it's true?
@_date: 2018-06-13 21:12:53
Yeah, it's kinda fucked up when you think about it. 
I want bitcoin to go to the moon just as much anyone else who has even $10 worth... but when I take a pause to look at the big picture of it all, it doesn't really make sense. When anything else goes up or down in price, there's usually an explanation of real\-world applications. But for Bitcoin it's mostly been something like "In todays news, Bitcoin up $2000 USD because... fuckit". And in reality there are SOOO many people that not only have no idea what it or a cryptocurrency is, but haven't even heard of them. 
I also saw a glimpse of an article this week that mentioned over 95&amp; of all bitcoins are in only 1600 wallets. That was a real eye opener for me as well, because it made me realize how few people are actually "using it".

You forgot to add how they're a 'cryptocurrency expert'
