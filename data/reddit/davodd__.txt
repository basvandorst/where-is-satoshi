And why so suddenly?
@_date: 2017-08-06 13:25:52
I thought about this some days ago and had the same question... If it ever gets so far, we would have a problem.
@_date: 2017-08-05 11:29:47
So should i trade my BCC for BTC now?
@_date: 2017-08-05 21:51:49
I want it :D
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:42:32
And why so suddenly?
@_date: 2017-07-25 21:45:31
Yes, thats partially true. The fee goes to the miner, who solves the block first
@_date: 2017-07-22 21:06:30
And in electrum - for example - i can just enter the seed and i have imported my coins?
@_date: 2017-07-22 23:10:46
You can use the seed with different wallets.
But the safest way to store btc for the long term is a paper wallet.

I know, but i can get them with the help of a bip39 generator any time, or am i wrong?
@_date: 2017-07-22 21:15:07
Do you leave your coins there?
@_date: 2017-07-25 11:44:47
Yes, because you are in control of your private key, when you store your coins in the electrum wallet.
@_date: 2017-07-25 19:55:34
When did you buy it?
@_date: 2017-07-22 21:09:15
Sure, but lets assume, im in a safe environment :D
@_date: 2017-07-22 21:01:56
With seed you meaning the 12 words?
@_date: 2017-07-20 18:12:21
I'll look what I can do :D
@_date: 2017-07-25 21:55:31
12.5 btc reward 
0.2 btc fee
=12.7 btc for the miner/pool
@_date: 2017-07-23 10:15:40
BIP91 doenst change anything... Its just a proposal to change something
@_date: 2017-07-25 22:18:11
@_date: 2017-07-25 22:27:44
Bad for the miners, but when the transaction time doenst get better, bitcoin will die. People dont want to wait hours and hours for a transaction to get some confirmations
@_date: 2017-07-22 21:53:47
I didnt transfer any Bitcoins
@_date: 2017-07-24 09:50:22
I hope this was a joke 
@_date: 2017-07-22 21:12:28
And in electrum my coins are safe even when the hardfork happens, because im in Control of my private Keys?
