I have posted there several times being critical of bcash and they just delete the comments but have not banned me.

Don't most of the coins out there have faster confirmations and lower fees right now? Why is bcash so special other than the fact that they put bitcoin in the name? Honest question.

Shut the f up. BCH/BCC people are out there claiming they are the real bitcoin. That is putting my money in jeopardy and the money of 100's of thousands of people like me that have invested in bitcoin. All because of some egotistical bs that side is playing. If their crappy mobile wallet gets downvoted don't come over here crying about it. Don't fuck with my moeny and I won't fuck with yours should be a boundary your side stays the fuck away from.

I wouldn't even care if they accepted advertisements for bitcoin cash. Linking to bitcoin.com as if it is a legitimate site for bitcoin is just crazy to me.

And ach is cheap because the fed handles that for most banks. It’s not because the infrastructure is better, it’s because it is subsidized by the central bank.

Either there is a criminal out there trying to become your personal assistant or someone is mixing alcohol and ambian.

You are right. I added an item sold by them and it had it as an option. Good to know. Thank you,

I don't want to say much in mixed company but they have s9's at a price I really want.

The last time I made a purchase I thought it was an option. I was just making a purchase and considered using bitcoins but it was not available and thought it was weird. I wish more merchants had this as a option.

As it gains legitimacy and wider adoption it will have to stabilize. It will naturally be prone to deflationary pressure so it will have that problem still. For now that's what keeps me buying.

One in a million. So you're telling me there is a chance...

I do track it all in excel to have a reliable cost basis but I just average everything by knowing my cost basis and can look at the current account value. If I buy at different prices and sell parts of my wallet it doesn't matter which coin is which.

I bought in at $3300. I also hovered over the buy button for a while but I was buzzed so I clicked it.

The only payment card displaying right now is the BCC :\

The IRS treats the sale of crypto currency as property and treated the same as any other gain or loss on property under IRS rules. From what I understand, you are probably best off using the FIFO method but you could specify what the cost of the coins you sold if you chose to.
Just like with the sale of a stock, if you bought 100 shares of something at $10 each and another 100 shares at $20 each then sell 100 shares you could report that the shares sold had a cost basis of either $10 or $20. A brokerage will default to reporting that the cost was $10 unless you specify otherwise.

Guys, BTC is at about the same price as a week ago and up 33% for the month. If you can not handle a little volatility buy CD's instead of crypto.

Bitcoin is not a stock.
