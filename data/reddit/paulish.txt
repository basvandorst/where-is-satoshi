Um I think the issue is how absurd the comparison is. Mining is such a loose metaphor to call what bitcoin miners do, to compare it to actual mining is silly. I hope op was being thoroughly sarcastic in their comment.  Poes law applies to bitcoin fanatics too.

This is the mentality of so many east coasters.

Is there at least a blog post somewhere explaining this?

Can you blame someone for selling when the price is going up? Should they have sold at the lowest point? That would have been arguably worse.

Isn't taint analysis BS anyways?

I think you hit the issues right on the nose. The zerocoin team claims they have a solution for public parameters/randomness, we will see what they come up with.
And admittedly zsnarks are in fact new crypto constructs, so we will need to see how they hold up. I can't at all be sure they will stand the test of time at this point. 
Nonetheless, zerocoin is an interesting syrtem in one form or another. I am optimistic that the devs can overcome these challenges.

Wasn't the point of bitcoin "greed is gpod" capitalism?

Plenty of places I've gone (mostly restaurants) offer a cash discount, which is effectively a card surcharge. I understand this is much more common is some countries other than the US. If it becomes more common in the US, we might see the true cost of credit cards reflected in the price we see.

Yup, it is graduate level seminar. I took it last semester in person. It is a great class that improved my understanding by leaps and bounds.

Isn't that the point? Bitcoin can't run purely on faith. It must be in people's selfish interest to use and build on top of.

Beyond signatures and hashes,  there isn't much crypto in bitcoin.

You bring up some good points. What if a large enough mining pool rejected transactions below a certain fee, and threatened to feather fork any block containing transactions that didn't meet their fee requirements?  This could effectively enforce a network wide fee. Perhaps even the threat of feather forking would be unnecessary,  and the delays caused by a few large mining pools rejecting transactions would be enough for people to pay higher fees.

That's about tree fiddy.
