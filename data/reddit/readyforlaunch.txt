Buffet doesn't want BTC or any crypto to succeed. It's not in his best interest.
He's a FUDder.

This sub was great when I first started out, for good times, but now I view it as legit stuffed with bad info.

I just heard an interview with the founder of SS and that tool suite this morning on the Unchained podcast - this guy stinks of scammer the entire interview. He is (pretty obviously) interested in bitcoin failing. 
Highly recommend the interview, and the pod in general - not sure who the woman is in terms of community clout but she asks several tough questions of Voorheesv that he has some trouble answering without sounding like a snake.

Carter Thomas brought up a pretty goiod point re: Soros and other funds/investment houses "trading" cryptos.
How would these guys justify to their investors that their money/keys are in the possession of an exchange that may/may not allow them to move freely between markets or withdraw or could disappear at any time.
It's more likely these guys are buying, or waiting to buy, and then using their own vehicles to drive the OTC price up - "trading", at least for now, is the wrong term.
