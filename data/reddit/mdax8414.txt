Really a cryptocurrency only "deserves" traction based on how it works.  Being "first" means nothing compared to a coin that's efficient and effective.
note: I'm not saying one coin is better than another.  I'm just pointing out what I believe to be a general truth.

We're still way higher than we were a week ago, and it seems to be balancing out a bit now.  Prices upwards of $400?  All the bubblers were of course going to bail out at some point, and it seems they have.  Hopefully that was most of them.. ("hopefully" being the operative word).
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:31:20
Prices will balance out for the most part eventually. If you want to invest before that happens (and possibly get in before a higher stabilized price), you risk losing money (getting in before it lowers).
Trying to time the market to buy low sell high isn't easy at all to do. However, with coinbase, if you do all the verification steps (one of which is linking a credit card to your account), you can buy almost instantly if there are sellers for you. Selling might take a few business days. 
So if you want instant coins, you can do that or try localbitcoins, which lets you get bitcoins from people in your locality. 
Or just whore yourself out on one of the bitcoin tipping subreddits (you'll have to look that up yourself).

I was confused at first, but from what I gather, he sold a ton of coins at the low price of $654 (undercutting everyone), meaning a lot of sellers could buy in at 654 and be done with their buys now before the market got even lower.  With the buyers satiated, there's little reason for the price to keep dropping - that is, people will stop undercutting each other to sell their coin because there are less people to sell to.
I think.  That would make me think there would be *more* undercutting, so it doesn't make total sense to me... but I'm still trying to figure it out.  
Can someone else explain better?

I like that your analysis isn't based on hope/desire/etc.and predicting the future, but actual past experiments with virtual currencies.  You have a keen eye for possible pitfalls, and it would be great if Libertymark would validate your point of view.
It's very dangerous to argue from ignorance, and just (if not more) dangerous to accept these "I want to believe, therefore it's true" posts on reddit that get upvoted by people feeling the same thing.  It's a dangerous trap.  
That is, just because a bunch of posts on this "expert opinion" subreddit (after all, this is *the* bitcoin subreddit) are upvoted to visibility doesn't mean these posts are based on valid arguments.
Thanks for being the voice of reason.

Couldn't these "elite" make more by driving up the price, selling mass quantities (inducing a panic sell), then buying up all they want for fractions of the peak price?
Then rinse &amp; repeat?
I don't see why they would care about driving the price up and up when they can buy a greater share in the market by manipulating the market - rather than make it harder (i.e. more expensive) to get a greater share in the market later on.

@_date: 2013-11-20 12:15:13
A bitcoin is a bitcoin wherever it is. Excahnges differ in price because of different trends in buy and sell orders, as well as volume.  Theoretically, if exchanges were instant and perfect (e.g. fully functional under the stress of lots of site visitors), you could buy low in one exchange and sell high in another. 
However, that's not the case: sell orders won't be filled instantly if other sellers undercut your order or if there just aren't enough buyers in the exchange, sites might buckle under the bandwidth load, and/or there might be processing delays.
Edit: see itsjustthat's post for better info. I'd redact parts of this if it wasnt tedious on an iPod.
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:38:26
I was going to sell a small amount so that I might be able to buy in come Monday, but Coinbase wouldn't credit the $$ to me until Thursday.
Thanks Coinbase - might have just saved me some cash.
Also, this panic could also be exacerbated by vendors from Bitcoin Black Friday who are trying to salvage their profits in the face of a so-called "crash" (I don't think it is).
If this is the case, might we expect this to happen after every consumerist holiday?  Just a thought.  Of course if we thought that was the case, a lot of people would sell right before the end of that period, possibly igniting a drop.

If my info is right, you'd just undercut everyone to flip the coins fast. You'd be the primary seller making big gains because you'd be making profit no matter how big of a panic sell you'd induce. You'd just have to be vigilant about undercutting and realize you can only sell so many at a time. But who knows, someone always commentsand proves me wrong.

Not sure what you're referring to... I didn't set up some kind of trap, if that's what you thought.
Anyway, whether you should sell depends on how much you have, and whether you think the price will go up and up and up, or "correct" to a lower value in accordance with a logarithmic scale (probably around 150, 200), or crash entirely due to panic selling.
Also, the more people hoard, the harder it is for other people to buy and thus spread the idea of a bitcoin.  Most everyone seems to be treating bitcoin like an investment, not an actual currency (of course the lack of places to spend it doesn't help).
But hey, do what you want.  What you "should" or "shouldn't" do depends on how you look at the big picture. :)

It's not always right.  It's hard to account for panicked firesales.  Of course that means the original chart wasn't accurate, but I feel that guy's explanation made sense for what it was.  Whether or not it was correct isn't the point.
But I feel ya.  Dat technical analysis indeed.

Long summers in shippable distances :) 
You might be creating a new shop for a wanting market. Sell to one biker, sell to the whole group soon enough. Most bikers seem to be part of a riding group (in my experience). If you need someone to reach out to these groups in the northeast USA (specifically NJ-PA-MA-lower NJ area), I could help... perhaps for commission? ;)

For some reason, this makes me want to try to win some bitcoinage, even though the odds are bad.

He didn't say he was surprised.  You'll do well to be taken seriously if you don't put words in someone else's mouth when responding.
That's all, carry on.

All good man.  I'm all about contrarian opinions, but OP's gif does nothing but:
A.) State the obvious
B.) Potentially scare new BTC owners who aren't knowledgable enough to understand price swings
C.) Encourage people to attempt to firesell currency they might as well hold (currency they might not even get to sell - but *will* be driven down by the attempt).
Sure, this assumes that people are easily swayed by the opinions of others... but this is and I think that idea fits (due to the downvoting of contrarian opinions, as you mentioned).
It's one of those things I'd rather not risk if it's not going to contribute anything.
If OP had a well-formed argument discussing why Bitcoin is dropping, I'd probably upvote that (or at least not downvote it - conflict of interest, y'know?)

The guy is saying that there's little incentive to be that "trusted" store if PayPal often sides with the *buyer* in disputes.  Why sell if there's the chance people could say they didn't receive their package and get their money back - effectively screwing over the seller (who doesn't have protections).
That's the guy's argument.
I don't use PayPal, so I dunno if that's accurate, but that's what he's positing.

It's Friday.  This is to be expected.
Downvoting to prevent additional panic.
