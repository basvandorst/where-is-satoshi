Maybe it's just me, but I don't think that will make a noticeable difference for bitcoiners, only the people trading the contracts.

Unless you have the time to watch the markets all day, the best thing you can do is buy during a selloff (a.k.a. dips, corrections, etc...) and then hold it long-term (typically at least one year)
It is *very* hard to predict intra-day price movements and holding tends to work out the best.

I use Gemini for my primary trading, Bittrex for trading the altcoins I'm GPU mining into Bitcoin and Ether, and GDAX for chart analysis. Gemini is the company that the CBOE futures are getting their data from. The one and only problem I have with them is their lack of chart analysis, but you can use GDAX charts without signing up.

Your skepticism is fair. I gave no evidence of my experience, and it is wise to criticize that which is not factual. I just want to note that I didn't claim to be an *expert*, I just was trying to add some information from my point of view that *I* thought was relevant. I'm sure I missed some things I should have included, but in my attempt to keep the post short I no doubt have delivered a less-than-perfect post. As for the grain of salt, I suggest taking *everything* on this subreddit with a lot of salt :)

It's not illegal, but it's also not common. Companies only short an asset when they either don't have any long positions: meaning they think it will fall, or they're protecting against the risk of a drop: meaning they believe it will rise.

It depends where you reside. Some countries and the states within have different exchanges available. Coinbase is the most generally available but they have the highest fees.
Some alternatives:
- GDAX
- Gemini (what I use)
- Bitstamp
- Kraken
- and many many more, just Google "Bitcoin exchanges"

This is why I like Gemini, because I can buy AND sell before the bank transfer clears.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:32:29
Nobody knows for sure, that is why the price moves. Buyers and sellers are playing tug-of-war, arguing over what is the fair price. You have to make your own opinion and trade on that. Use number and logic, and do not ever trade on emotion.
Just to answer your question, I'll say that I think there will be a time in the near future that we see another big rally. CME Bitcoin futures will add a lot of volatility to it but I think after a few days it ought to stabilize and head upwards. *but who knows*

Unless the IRS comes up with some exception for cryptocurrencies, which they currently do not have, taxes will come into play each time you convert BTC back to USD. Just like trading stocks, when you convert the asset to USD, the taxes will apply. However, you only pay those taxes (assuming you made a profit) once a year, and if you lose money on some trades, those trades will reduce the taxes you have to pay on winning trades.
TL;DR: it will work out the same way by the end of the year regardless, and you only pay taxes on the net realized profit (a.k.a., the increase in USD in the account) for the entire year.
Gemini basically acts as a buffer bank account, having the same tax effect as your standard savings/checking account because, fundamentally, they do the same thing (hold your money until you want to withdraw)
EDIT: Also, keep in mind that if you're flipping it within the year, any profit from those trades will be taxed at the higher rate unless the net profit for the year is negative.

Usually, the deal is that if you hodl it for more than 1 year it is taxed as a Capital Gain at a 15% tax rate. If you hodl it for less than 1 year it is taxed at your income tax bracket (10% to 40% depending on your tax bracket).

I think the biggest issue with Bitcoin is the lack of understanding of how it works by 99% of people. Bitcoin is completely transparent, so as it gets more attention the media will be dissecting it and their followers will start to learn what makes it valuable. I have absolutely no idea the extent, but I'm confident Bitcoin will continue to grow in value and presence as more and more people embrace it.

Fellow Minnesotan here. Use Gemini. It has 0.25% fees on all trades and pre-credited deposits so you can trade on the money you deposit before it gets cleared through ACH.
The one and only issue I have with them is lack of chart analysis, but other than that they've been awesome.
Also, the CBOE Bitcoin Futures are using data from Gemini specifically.

Over time, as mining equipment gets *significantly* more cost-effective and energy efficient, the transaction fees that are paid to miners will take over for the lack of new coins issued. Mining will still be quite profitable, but will be covered solely by the fees.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:52:31
I highly doubt it, but I can't rule it out. It's usually more obvious when a firm tries to influence a market, i.e., they'll make a fuss about how they think it will skyrocket and they put tons of money in it and blah blah blah. They verbally pump it up after buying it, but until they announce it, we see it as just extra buy orders. Those buy orders will have some influence on their own, but not a lot.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:39:50
The fees are too high for my liking but overall it's not bad.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:34:41
You're correct. The futures traders won't be trading Bitcoin so it won't directly be adding volume. The increase in volume will come from actual Bitcoin traders who are trading more frequently to match the value set from futures. The price of futures is determined by the underlying asset (Bitcoin), but in reality it is a two-way street. Bitcoin will be changing hands more often as an indirect result.
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:12:50
Exactly. Investing is about making educated guesses.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:40:05
Volume does not directly affect market cap. Volume affects liquidity: the amount of money being traded in the market. I think we'll see a higher price per coin as an indirect affect, but more traders =/= higher price automatically.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:29:33
Funny you should say that. I've been thinking about making a website dedicated to financial literacy, including trading financial assets. Anyways...
Investopedia is a pretty good tool, but it's best for those who already have intermediate knowledge.
This is my advice for getting started, based on how I learned. Everyone will argue on the *best* way, and it's up to you to foster your own education. I started by opening an account at TD Ameritrade and putting in $100. TD Ameritrade is my favorite, but this is another highly debated topic. Many brokers, including TDA, offer simulated trading. TDA calls it "Paper Money" where they give you $200,000 of play money you can make simulated trades with. I'd recommend learning by doing. Follow your gut. Make mistakes, and learn from them. The best way to learn is by making mistakes.
Learn the absolute basics, i.e., what stocks are and how they're valued &amp; traded. Put some fake (or real, if you're ready) into a few of your favorite companies. Subscribe to some news outlets (CNBC, WSJ, etc...) and let yourself get immersed. It's like when you learned to talk, you were surrounded by people doing it and you just figured it out through exposure.

WHAT? SOMEONE ON THE INTERNET WANTS MY OPINION? IMPOSSIBLE!
(Yes, I believe that's correct. Any gain on asset conversion should be recorded in tax filing, but it will net out with your annual gains and losses. If you make $5k on one trade, and lose $1k on another in the same year, you only pay taxes on the $4k net profit.)

@_date: 2017-12-07 01:00:28
Yes, the conversions are taxable, but what I think is tricky is whether or not all conversions are taxed or just the final conversion to USD. Like I said, I'm almost positive that its the former and they're taxed at the equivalent USD value gained, but there isn't precedence for non-USD related conversions.
Also, either way the final taxed value should be the same, it's just the way that it gets to that final value that I'm questioning.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:04:39

@_date: 2017-12-07 06:15:01


No. Every time you sell an asset you add the profit/loss to your balance for the year. The taxes are added up for the annual gain of short term and long term assets. But this would add up the same way as if you only paid on the USD conversion, since it would include the gains from everything leading up to it. Mathematically it makes no difference but you still have to record each conversion.


Yes. Holding less than a year is almost always taxed at a noticeably higher rate than holding for more than one year. However, if the only reason you are waiting to sell is you're close to the 1 year mark, you should just sell. It's a dumb reason to suffer from a crash.

@_date: 2017-12-11 01:28:00
Yeah, I should have emphasized the *people* aspect of it. I agree that institutions are not yet ready to trade BTC but a lot of wealthy individuals within them are. It's hard to predict what the ultimate effect will be but I still believe we'll see a noticeable increase in volume on the underlying. Also, as current exchanges get proper regulation and if BTC ever trades on existing stock exchanges, the institutions themselves could be seen getting in at some point.
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:04:38
Yes, but I think *that* will be offset by more players getting involved overall. Offsetception. My assumption is that regulated securities will also encourage more people &amp; firms to invest in the underlying asset because now it appears to be "legit" to them.

Ignore that. If they don't argue their case then it's not worth listening to. Bitcoin is very controversial and not everyone browsing this subreddit is on the same side. Those subscribed are pro-bitcoin, bit there are plenty of visitors that aren't.
Follow your gut. Don't second guess yourself. And only invest what you're willing to lose in the rare event that everything goes to shit (this investment advice is for more than just Bitcoin. It's the same for stocks, stock derivatives, bonds, futures, foreign exchange, etc)
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:53:18
That's tricky because this doesn't really have an existing system to compare with. In existing financial markets, it revolves around one currency.
I would consult a professional. I pay a professional to do my taxes every year and it takes the worry out of everything.
For the sake of answering your question to the best of my abilities, I'm *pretty sure* that each time you sold, no matter what currency it gets converted to, the realized P/L would be taxable in the equivalent USD amount at the time of sale.

It is always buying+selling that drives the price. An asset is only worth what people are willing to pay for it. Buyers and sellers are constantly playing tug-of-war to drive the price one way or the other. Everyone comes up with the value that *they* think it is worth and it is the argument over the proper price that moves the value. Volatility increases with news events but at the end of the day it's all about the traders.

It's certainly possible. The best thing you can do, in my opinion, is place some Limit orders decently below the current price so that you don't have to babysit the exchange all of the time.
