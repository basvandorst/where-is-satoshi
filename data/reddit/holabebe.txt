Many ideas like cacao imports( long term goal) short term start selling stuff on eBay(like I used to in the past) I have a guy who get shoes for cheap. After that I will basically start to accumulate capital and start buying some apartments overseas(my native country,) I have a long list of thing and I already have some capital to bring some of these ideas to life.
