You mean likely to blow up in your face? 
@_date: 2018-11-25 20:51:58
Does anyone have experience with making this trade? 
@_date: 2018-11-25 21:08:42
Yeah that's what it seems like. As if the market is listening to them and will be persuaded, lol. 
Nothing is an investment until the day you sell it. Until then it's a gamble or just an expenditure. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 21:13:29
You can do that, if you don't care how much money you have. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 04:03:58
It is, but it's the teller where you deposit. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 04:04:56
That's exactly how you make money with bitcoin.   
Exactly the same as the stock market.

Hope for what? A better time to sell BTC for dollars? 
Curious whether -- in light of the extreme volatility now -- hodlers are still thinking that BTC will someday be a currency (that they will own a lot of), or are just looking at it as a speculative investment that they can't wait to cash (US dollar) out of? 
@_date: 2018-11-25 21:23:18
Then I don't see why you expect to "win" hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of currency. 
The best way to make money is to exploit the irrational gambling of others, not speculate on pseudo-currency markets. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 04:02:22
I don't usually follow bitcoin, but it's in the news because it's crashing. Bitcoin bugs are sort of a subculture, so it's just interesting to log in and watch what they're saying to each other. Have seen references on twitter to "what hodlers are saying on reddit." It's mostly that. 
It's not like there's a conspiracy to make money by shorting against a bunch of financially naive gambling addicts or something. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 03:53:29
I disagree with you on that one, although yeah it's interesting. But arms dealers, drug dealers, etc, still need to cash out of bitcoin into dollars. Nobody wants to get left hodling the bag in an instrument that is dropping in value. They will will not store value in bitcoin when it is dropping. There is nothing that could possibly hold it at a steady value -- am I missing something? Like, 'I just sold a million dollars worth of coke, I will just keep the dough in my bitcoin account, because I don't really care if it goes up or down.' No - they have a business to run. And if it comes down to just illicit use, it will get shitcanned by the authorities. 
You're talking more about an exchange/transfer mechanism than a currency. This is what discussions about bitcoin always come back to. Currency, how?Total market cap for bitcoin is what $58 billion dollars? That is chicken shit really.

Down almost 4% in one day? I'm enjoying the hell out of watching this situation as entertainment -- have no position on either side. But as a spectator sport it's great -- volatility out the wazoo. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 01:03:31
By more of a currency if it didn't grow, I mean that the value would be more stable. For example, if only some subculture of a million people used it, with a fairly stable total "M1" supply of bitcoin, the value could stabilize. People are not storing money in bitcoin. Even if I liked bitcoin, I could not trust that its value will remain +/- 10% for a year. It's not money. 
But the way it really works, it is it can never really stabilize without a massive switch from dollars to crypto, and if that happened, there would be a massive spike in its value; I don't see that happening because that would make the value unstable, and people would pull back out. It's circular. More likely a cryto conversion of US soverign backed currency. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 23:07:03
Only problem is, it's not money. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 01:47:08
Yeah, thought so. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 23:01:15
I don't own bitcoin. Do you want American dollars? 
@_date: 2018-12-07 01:09:58
Why are *you* here? To shout down people that you don't agree with? Are you trying to raise the price of bitcoin by boosting it on reddit? 
@_date: 2018-12-07 03:42:52


That's the part I don't get. Since it's a "currency" not an equity or some commodity, there is nowhere -- in relation to it's arch-rival the dollar -- that could possibly be fundamentally stable. Not unless it's sort of like a delimited subculture that hodlers use to pay for shit, but that doesn't make sense either. 
IDK I'm not really a gambler, I'm more of an opinion-haver. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:31:05
Lots of people say "I'm shorting...!" on reddit when it's not true, with no consequences -- he may not actually be shorting bitcoin. Sorry for the sarcasm. 
Not sure the counterparty is really there for shorting bitcoin. Seems US residents are banned. I don't know, I'm with Bill Gates, I would put a couple grand in a short position right now if I could do it on Robinhood. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 22:58:46
You are asking for investment advice on reddit. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:21:33
What instrument are you using to actually short bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-12-07 00:46:25
Yeah but only by selling dollars for bitcoins, and then buying goods and services that could have been bought in dollars, losing money in the transaction cost. You can't store value in bitcoin at a stable value. 
A currency is sort of like an economic subculture. Like all Swiss people use Swiss Francs to buy shit in Switzerland. Bitcoin could work that way if it *didn't* grow.
@_date: 2018-12-07 00:24:51
Another post answered it, and it makes a strong case that Bitcoin cannot get out of its death spiral:
It seems that hodlers want to believe in both arguments at once: that it is an asset to hodl for some indefinite period because the value will rise, and also that it is a "currency," although it is not stable. Pick one, hodlers.
I think you need to know when to hodl 'em, know when to fodl 'em, and you best get your dollars while you still can.
@_date: 2018-12-07 00:18:59
Okay, not sure what that's about but thanks for the sentiment. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 03:19:09


Lol, amen man. Sorry for your loss. Even people who understand the random walk and everything can be tempted into trying to time markets. It just looks too juicy right now. Everything the hodlers say convinces me that they are loop-dee-doop, and there's no way bitcoin could ever conceivably become something like a currency. I can't even imagine how this could go back up.
If there was a normal mechanism I would short, if I make 5% call it a good day and close out. But actually I probably wouldn't, lol.
@_date: 2018-12-07 01:54:54
The dollar is backed by the US government, and that means a lot. 
A think a lot of basic economics is missing from the thinking of people who are retail buyers of bitcoin. In the meantime, I am still not seeing a viable model for it getting to a market cap where it would stabilize. Just can't see any way it could happen. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 00:43:12
Nope. The security of bitcoin's network is of zero interest of me.
What's interesting is that 80% of miners are in China, and their breakeven is around $3000. That could get very interesting soon, and especially in the run-up to Chinese new year in February, when people will want to pull their liquidity. A certain number of Chinese people will say, I don't care about the bitcoin market, I just want my $3000 in RMB right now so I can spend it on the new year. Let some other guy have the bitcoin. That could trigger a race for the exits, and increase the motivation of everyone to get out. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 22:53:37
That is, er, incredibly cheap electricity. Can you please show me where you can get electricity at $.04.kwh?
This is what I'm seeing: there are countries where it is heavily subsidized, and they are not necessarily countries that want to turn their coal into bitcoin:
[  
This would indicate that in practice, it's already below break even. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 00:30:30
I don't understand the argument for seeing Bitcoin as a currency. It doesn't have a stable value. I understand playing the asset value bubble speculation game. But not the idea that this is currency. The only way that this will ever be a currency is if people start shoveling the trillions of dollars (and other currencies and stores of value) out there into bitcoin, and if that happens, the price will spike, so it will still not be a stable store of value, so it won't happen. It's baked in. 
I mean, enjoy yourselves, don't hate on me. But what's the argument that it is a currency? 
@_date: 2018-12-06 23:16:08
I would not want to set up shop in Siberia either -- buying bitcoin with rubles. I would not want to set up shop in China either, where the government could turn on you at any moment (same, Russia) and make you very sorry you ever went into this business. And I would not want to set up in India, where there are many far better investments to put rupees into. If you are in Venezuela you are already riding a donkey to Colombia. 
It's only profitable anywhere depending on when you *spend* the bitcoin, and what currency you convert it into at what rate. Most people are going to get reamed.
