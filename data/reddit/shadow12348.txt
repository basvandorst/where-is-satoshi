By more adoption, do you mean being able to buy stuff with BTC?  
I remember being in Bern and being able to buy BTC from the SBB machines, really a step forward!

Understandable, you can hook up your BLW to your own LN node though, albeit not user friendly.

Awesome! Leave your email ID on our site and we'll get in touch before the beta ([lastbit.io]( EU beta users would be ideal for us
@_date: 2019-02-23 17:06:37
Thanks! Right now we're working crazy hard preparing for the beta and getting the first devices ready for early testers. We'll send out periodic emails over the next couple of weeks about what to expect and when to expect it (early-mid April tentative)!

Sure, the idea started off as "Let's say I've got 100 BTC on my trezor wallet. I can safely leave that at home and be quite sure nothing will happen to it. But having gotten to travel to a bunch of countries with different currencies, it was quite sad being unable to use bitcoin to pay for any purchase. So it's like this - Imagine I can walk into a store and tap my trezor against an existing credit card machine and pay for my purchase with bitcoin, even if the merchant doesn't accept bitcoin" - This is pretty much what we're doing :)

Nope, Cortex-M23 with TZ. We can emulate a pretty decent level of security with these TZ chips including physical tamper detection but of course needs a ton of testing to nail down, one of the things we hope to get out of the beta.
@_date: 2019-02-23 17:30:32
Agreed, this is super super early stage. We've experimented with several ideas of much simpler form factors for next versions.
@_date: 2019-02-23 17:04:54
Awesome, we figure about 10% of everyone that signs up on the website will eventually show up for the beta. We're maintaining a separate list of people that just expressed interest on reddit. Will DM you before we do the beta then! Thank you!
@_date: 2019-02-23 17:48:54
Fair enough.
I'm a coldcard owner myself ;) Had some fun tinkering with it earlier this year.
@_date: 2019-02-23 17:29:50
That's awesome! Did you sign up for the beta on our site?
@_date: 2019-02-23 11:32:13
Yup that's the one, thanks!
@_date: 2019-02-23 17:34:22
The trezor and ledger have done an excellent job creating cold storage hardware wallets. This isn't another hardware wallet, creating another hardware wallet would be quite pointless, agreed.
The idea started from "Imagine being able to take my trezor into a shop and tap it against a credit card machine and pay with the bitcoin stored on my ledger - even if the merchant doesn't accept bitcoin" and that's what we're doing :) So, to be able to do that, we inherently need a hardware wallet as a base layer and that's what the beta  is about, getting that right is quite complex, as opposed to making a hardware wrapper around a trezor or a ledger.
@_date: 2019-02-24 03:25:24
Thank you! Appreciate it.
@_date: 2019-02-23 17:45:24
Yeah we've not given up on the Winbond element for this reason, a few options here.
Hmm what are your thoughts on the trezor then? Pretty vanilla MCU
@_date: 2019-02-23 17:05:39
Yup, please just leave your email id on your website ([lastbit.io]( and we'll send out periodic emails with our progress and when and what to expect for the beta :) 
@_date: 2019-02-23 17:36:46
Currently evaluating a Winbond W76S. But if we choose this we can't make it 100% open-source which is kind of a deal breaker for us.
@_date: 2019-02-24 03:24:24
Yes. We're incrementally reaching out to investors for a seed round.

Could you DM me your e-mail ID? I'll add you manually.

A total self contained device was one of the early revisions we made but turned out stupidly complex. [It's a pretty elaborate plan]( but this is the first device in our family. It pairs to your android/ios device via ble.
@_date: 2019-02-24 03:25:40
Sure, a little more info?
@_date: 2019-02-24 03:23:57
Considering both. Possibly a kickstarter a few months from now!
@_date: 2019-02-23 11:24:13
Awesome! Sign up on the website ([lastbit.io]( and I'll DM you too before we launch the beta.

Great, just leave your email ID on our website at the bottom ([lastbit.io]( and we'll get in touch with more details about the beta.
@_date: 2019-02-23 17:05:08
Yes, definitely will do! Thank you!
@_date: 2019-02-23 11:28:49
I wish I could show you everything this is about and start releasing all HW &amp; FW out to the public. Still a few months before we can do that. 
1. Yes mobile phones do provide a massive attack surface which is exactly the problem that hardware wallets ([ledger.com]( &amp; [trezor.io]( were invented to solve - A device whose sole function is to keep your bitcoin safe &amp; as proof of that have completely open source code that can be audited and verified (Atleast trezor does).
2. Agreed, mobile phones are 100x more convenient if we lived in a world where crypto is accepted anywhere and you could just whip your phone out and pay. Secure elements have been on phones since 2003 but it's not as simple as that and this solution ([lastbit.io]( is one step towards solving that problem in the best possible manner, i.e. you and only you control your crypto, pay with crypto even if the merchant does not accept it and you don't have to take your entire portfolio out with you!   
Imagine you have 100 BTC as your life savings, would you want to store that on a phone and take it out with you everyday?

Yup, in the range of 60-80 $US for the beta. If there was no hardware involved of course this would be free :)  
And for supporting us in the early days, when we launch and have a much more optimized manufacturing process, the beta testers get the final device for a stupidly low price.
@_date: 2017-09-06 09:24:45
Funnily enough you can buy bitcoins at the machine but not pay for a ticket using btc
@_date: 2017-09-06 12:08:27
Yup you can pay with cash/coins/card
@_date: 2017-09-06 12:05:52
Approximately 9% more than on an exchange which is ~295$ more 
@_date: 2017-09-06 12:06:55
Wow, they should really advertise this! I stumbled on the bitcoin option by accident
@_date: 2017-09-06 12:43:01
I lyk bitcoin
