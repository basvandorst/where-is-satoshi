I really want to know what on Earth you two are talking about, but I don't even know what to google here. ELI5?

Holy crap it's a circus over there!
I can't understand half of the titles






I feel like the time I went to @_date: 2016-12-03 04:04:24
According to [this source]( the Indian Government has removed the 1000 and the 500 rupee notes from circulation and have replaced all notes with new ones.
My question is, why did they remove the 1000 and the 500 notes if there is still the 2000 notes? Is my source BS? (wouldn't be surprised anymore)
Is there anything else I said that isn't right?
Have you been personally affected by this and if so how and how badly?
This is the first I've heard of these events in India and I'm deeply curious.

So the public at large is in support of this move? I can't find a single article that isn't slanted against it.

Wonderful reply, covered most bases. Just two points of interest though:
First time I've ever seen that number system before, can't say I'm a fan but glad to be introduced to something so new to me.


But if they issued all new currency anyway, and wanted people to stop hoarding money and ween off physical money all together, why did they issue a larger bill? Wouldn't a larger bill just make it even easier to hoard large amounts of money? 
The United States has done similar actions, removing the $1000 bill from print because the unit was facilitating easy illicit trade, so obviously there is economic policy precedent for the action, but the context is completely different.
I understand that it will render current cash hoards useless. But wont this new larger note just facilitate the exact same hoarding they are currently attempting to purge? Won't the cycle just start right the fuck over again in a few years? This whole situation seems to stem from the fact that your government has failed to monitor paper money currently, so what could they possibly do to this new series of notes to actually know if people are stashing it away?
And thanks again for such a comprehensive answer, on mobile no less. Nobody can argue that that must have sucked to type out on mobile.

For the uninitiated, what announcement are you talking about?
@_date: 2016-12-03 06:09:10
That's what I'm confused about, they are doing just that. It doesn't make any damn sense. 
Like, what the hell?

I am, and I still don't understand how the removal of the two biggest bank notes is going to do anything to stop note hoarding if they introduce a new even bigger note. 
It seems counter intuitive. It's like banning all pistols but removing any bans on miniguns and tanks. Why bother?
