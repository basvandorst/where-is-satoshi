So a Trezor's security is just a 4 digit pin?

What is the change, in untechnical terms?

For the record, can anybody recommend a *good* OSX Wallet for Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2016-11-22 12:47:55
No £s?

Sorry so you're saying you've broken even and then made profits?
@_date: 2016-11-18 15:26:09
Yeah, they are seriously the worst. They have shitty customer service and every response is 'contract contract'

He probably owns some cocaine, too.

This is a joke, right? 
Phones are less prone to theft?

Wasn't the question

OK, got you. 
Depressingly, the predictions I've found for a cloudmining calculator that predicts Genesis' output is nowhere close to $8-10 per day. My investment amount is more substantial but I'm being predicted a daily return of pennies! I will update when I get my first payout. 
What seems even more bizarre to me is that THEY can apparently just 'cancel' my contract at any time. And I don't think this means returning the money. All over the internet you can read stories about Genesis just stopped paying out. 
I really messed up here and learned my lesson very well. I wish I could just have the money back. I tried to cancel on day one before anything had happened, but unsurprisingly they said no.

You don't think if Bitcoin were made illegal in the US that would have a devastating effect on the market?
@_date: 2016-11-25 09:41:15
No, but it might have reached old age. Can we talk about cryptos' limitations without being facetious or partisan?
@_date: 2016-11-19 13:10:30
For real? When did you start with them?

Interesting thought re : the USB. Paper wallet just seems so counter-intuitive. It sounds like having a million dollar bill. 
Not sure I see how making multiple copies makes it more or less safe, but you raise some very interesting points. 
@_date: 2016-12-13 12:59:15
Neither did anyone else. He certainly wouldn't have known in 2009 of Bitcoin's success. Your case is sloppy.
@_date: 2016-12-01 21:48:41
Yeah you can make it illegal. You could make a mandatory name registry for wallets. You could turn it into a black market only commodity.

How did you enjoy paying those transaction fees each time you bought one drink?
