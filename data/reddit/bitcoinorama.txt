I dont want the money, give it to charity and do some good pr for bitcoin. Nothing politcal, just kids, homeless, animals, disaster, environment, elderly or the ill please.
Note i actually tried to do this in 2013 as a pr move when there were some mining funds, no one would touch it but these days they see bitcoin different and i think you could do much more or a return for everyone if you saw this through. Make it 100btc a month for a diff charity. Best, A.

Sorry my bad, but basically you are selling as many tokens for approx $450 (1btc) each and then determining they are equal to a cumulative 5%?

Banks here are blackballing Bitcoin by and large. UK Gov is open to the innovation, but 5 main banks control all merchant accounts so herein lies the problem. These banks are acting like a cartel. Can you guess who? (One is Spanish)

@_date: 2016-04-28 00:36:31
Is there any promise in the conditions of sale that ensure shares wont be diluted in future. Tonnes of start-ups screw early investors and employees by issuing shares ad hoc in future rounds devaluing previous shareholdings. In the literature it alludes that now is the best time to buy, but in my experience companies just dilute the holdings of those that funded and broke sweat for them. Will any future share sales ensure the 5% of the company currently sold maintains proportionality?
@_date: 2016-04-28 21:48:29
Agreed but you are basing the valuation of the company in the literature on site on silicon valley math and not real world math. As there are no real physical assets or income yet - no EBITA to base 10yr projected income. Merely if we can raise 2000btc in this first round (approx $9m) for 5% of the company Mycillium is worth $180m which is nonsense. If mycellium was to close within a year or two there would be no assets to recoup any monies invested and no real VC (ignoring silicon valley hype) would invest in mycellium under the belief it is currently or daresay in the near future worth $180m.
Unless i'm missing something, are you really claiming 1 token = 1btc and you are selling 2000 tokens?? And intend to raise another 12000btc for a further 20% equity, or are these just numbers out of thin air. I'm trying to determine what of this is real. Please explain.
@_date: 2016-04-27 15:53:26
The crowd sale is through BTC as the choice of currency. Mycellium states the value of the share will be denominated in USD. You are investing in the company's wallet asset, nothing else, not hardware or future alternative products.
@_date: 2016-04-26 21:46:07
A couple of things concern me;
1). If you choose to invest, bear in mind; do you foresee Mycellium undergoing the same % increase in value over time as Bitcoin? As if Bitcoin is set to make greater increases over time and Mycelium is by and large tethered to Bitcoins success (albeit not entirely), the greater investment is holding bitcoin. That aside Mycellium has shown itself to be a great company, but Bitcoin is currently rising in value irrespective of the 10% incentive Mycellium is offering.
2). Rassah; Mycellium says irrespective of Bitcoins price, if it falls the shares are still of value as they are priced in USD. Yet in the terms it suggests a share = 1BTC, is that going to be the case? As if 1 share is equal to 1 BTC, the valuation of the company come the end of the sale is entirely dependant on BTC value in USD, and throughout that period some people will be purchasing their stake in the company at varied rate in USD. Surely shares should then be priced in USD even when sold in BTC if the company is to be valued in USD regardless....
@_date: 2016-04-27 01:13:09
surprised this isnt getting any attention?!
@_date: 2016-04-20 18:20:13
What people are missing is that Transferwise wanted to use Bitcoin then got told they would lose access to merchant accounts if they did. 
Bearing in mind transferwise already step on the toes of the banks whilst being held at their mercy they dont want to lose their precious merchant accounts or their business is sunk.
So like Paypal Visa and Mastercard were strongarmed into refusing donations to Wikileaks Transferwise are just sucking up to those that allow them to continue to trade pure and simple.
For Transferwise it is a game of survival, they need their merchant accounts they say whatever pleases their gatekeepers. Unlike Taavet Hinrikus Bitcoin doesn't have an ultimate exit strategy and will just continue to honeybadger.

@_date: 2016-04-28 19:29:37
so these 5% sold always retain their proportional value irrespective of however much additional funds are raise by issuing more shares?
Rassah i suggest you delay the fundraise and flesh out the compelling offer you intend to raise from. Fools rush in etc. How will anyone be able to resell the shares from this 5% as any different from any other future shares if they will be worth proportionately more?

With blockchain, bank cartels become bank alliances
Print this page 0
2 HOURS AGO By: Izabella Kaminska
Here’s Bloomberg’s Matt Levine on Tuesday riffing on the news that Microsoft, JP Morgan Chase and other corporate giants are “joining forces” to create the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, a new kind of computing system based on the virtual currency network Ethereum, noting that as always, the idea is to take an open, un-permissioned blockchain system (Bitcoin, the Ethereum smart-contract network) and turn it into a closed ecosystem dominated by major banks:
One objection to this would be: The original point of these blockchain innovations was to disintermediate the big banks and allow new competitors to spring up. Building a closed smart-contract blockchain run by banks defeats that purpose, and makes the blockchain just a boring upgrade to existing bank technology systems.
But there’s another objection, which is that the maximalist blockchain dream isn’t just about disintermediation. It’s also about putting everything on one blockchain, using a single universal blockchain to track identity and money and commerce and whatever else you’ve got. Shipping companies would track their cargos on the same blockchain where they tracked payments, rather than relying on banks to do the payments on their own separate blockchain. Securities transactions would settle instantly because both the securities and the currencies would live in a single system. Creating different blockchains for different purposes is just like — well, I mean, banks keep track of who has money now, and securities intermediaries keep track of who has securities, and shipping companies keep track of where their ships are. Doing all of that on separate blockchains, instead of separate databases, might be a technology upgrade (or a bunch of technology upgrades), but it is not a revolution.
He’s right. It’s not a revolution. It’s a systems upgrade at best, and at worst a downgrade into a less efficient system which heightens cartelisation forces and introduces all sorts of new collective action and group-think problems to banking and risk management.
Meanwhile, most of the blockchain companies involved in this venture have pivoted on their initial propositions so many times, it would be fake news to keep calling this a blockchain story.
In the interests of highlighting today’s modern mode of journalistic/PR management, it’s worth noting the story about the alliance’s formation was shopped around on supposedly exclusive terms (with all sorts of opportunities for journalists to have the relevant context “framed” for them ) to at least six media firms since Jan 29, among them the NYTimes, the WSJ, Bloomberg, Reuters, CoinDesk and FT Alphaville. We said we’d wait for the public press release.
Of course, in a world where journalists are believed to be malleable if they think they’re being offered an exclusive, should we really be surprised the corporations involved think no-one will notice that “alliance” in this use-case is just a euphemism for cartel. Not that we’re surprised this is happening. As we’ve argued for ages, cartel formation was inevitable for any of this stuff to be even vaguely succeed.
It’s worth caveating, of course, that banking has always orientated towards cartel structures with high synthetic start-up capital costs,because the good the sector ultimately provides (trust) has a zero marginal cost of production. This renders the industry uniquely vulnerable to undercutting (which, in the case of banking, equates to competitors buying off customers with other people’s money by providing loans at ridiculously cheap risk-inducing rates at the same time as over-promising returns to investors. A.k.a taking on too much risk).
But given we already have a pretty substantial banking cartel defending our interests from macro-prudential risk, do we really need to revolutionise the sector with more?

PoS is about handing the banks control via stakeholder voting with the largest holder making the decisions so a permission based ledger ethereum becomes. No cap rewards these stakeholders over time creating a wealth divide. This is what i said santander was planning months back, I was present with Accenture BBVA BNY Mellon and Santander. At the time they want to force ripple but ethereum were begging for cash. Mariano from Santander knew no bank could suggest a solution of their own as none would trust so they wanted to fly under the radar with some bs geeks made up.

if you are being pedantic you can win if you want. :) That list on Wikipedia is incorrect. Everyone around me in Stockholm was on around £80-120k GBP, but tax is 65%. I never met anyone on a wage as low as Wikipedia states. Fuck and that's in USD, bro tha list is way off average wage in UK (let alone London is not 20k GBP), you need 70k GBP (above 100k US) to just afford a mortgage in a tiny studio in London.
healthcare - sorry i may be biassed my sister is a surgeon and the NHS has saved my life more than once. I paid $15 for ibuprofen in the US! That's less than a dollar in the UK.
housing, never mentioned size but obv the us has large spaces and new york has small. The house build quality in London and Stockholm is far more solid and price wise London is the most expensive in the world so you get to live in a 25sqm studio as you do in Stockholm for the price of a flat in New York or San Francisco. Out of Stockholm sure you can have as much land as you want and in Sweden housing is often free.
Food quality, US has no chance on this one, its some of the worst I've eaten. Sure portions are large but ingredients are often unhealthy. Sweden has varying tax. Healthy food is cheaper, meats and sweets are more expensive. GMO doesn't exist.
manners: varies in the US, South, Atlanta, Austin al super polite. New York, Vegas horrible, rude, you shouldn't have to pay or tip for manners, and they do get you everywhere.
Women; If we just focus on London, 11m+ massively culturally diverse (as is all of europe), but London attracts the hottest women. Sweden just produces a greater average than anywhere else aside Hungary. You literally fall in love at every station. Hungarian women are the politest to. Berlin and Amsterdam have the coolest.

yes if there is any shred of truth he is satoshi, but jvp and grigg all met him years before in person thin 2009, it was at some dev comp. Supposedly there's two books and a reuters article being written. Not sure about the reuters article which is about the extortion but the books are with out his consent. If he signs the proof publicly the aussie tax authorities and associated governments who believe he is legit can make a lot of demands. Whereas if he claims a trust prevents him till 2020 that buys time. Again this could be BS but those surround him believe its him and both Uyen and JVP were as satoshi round table last year theres a group pic they are in the middle of.

@_date: 2016-06-21 18:35:34
OK look i'm not defending what happened, i find it bizarre that i know people connected and they are asserting theres more to come. If he did prove he could move funds irrespective of trust he is showing the Aus revenue service he can unlock a potential 1m btc windfall. They wont care about the trust they will care about a % of 1m btc which makes r&amp;d tax credit a lesser concern.

Yes that article was proven to be fake. At the time Craig used it as an excuse to avoid coming out. Whether he knew it to be a fake or not, he used it as his justification. In any case you have more of this story to come including evidence from whilstleblowers and a journalist exposing the woman extorting Wrigh. She has already been outed a few weeks back, but presumably there is significant evidence about her involvement. Whatever the notion for wright being an attention seeker is bunk. He never brought the media upon him or the PR agency, that was his now former business partners wanting to capitalise on the outing this woman is supposedly responsible for.

For sure anything can happen, a favourable article in mainstream press and some renewed interest on top of Chinese weekend craziness, let alone reward halving and the impact on miners, irrespective of the price increasing the supply of new coin is decreasing meaning decreasing supply of newly created liquidity.
The reason the value fell so much last time was European mining firms ditching coins to prevent loans in china making their way to profit wrt to Chinese  creating new hardware and thus mining competition (inevitable), and Bitpay's business model of guaranteeing fiat for products sold in BTC.

It will typically cost £3,000 – 5,000 or more to file a patent application just in the UK, and it can cost £20,000 or more for a global patent filing programme. Whether that represents good value or not depends, ultimately, on the commercial value of the patent – whether it protects an invention that has commercial value, and whether the inventors have the expertise and resources to realise that value. it costs around £350 to file then you have 12 months to make a decision on whther you want to UK, europe or global. Assuming this has an intent for worldwide usage £20k x 50+ patents = £1m of his own money. Quite a staement nonetheless.

My feeling is that you should always strive to create a working proof of concept and build a small but genuine audience, then you have evidence of something working with a need to raise and a means to negotiate aside empty promises. You have evidence your model can scale.
Which to be honest is how Coinbase were funded themselves, albeit with a bit of dishonesty claiming 3 million users when they had 3 million wallets (which can be created instantly to pump figures - this obviously fooled VCs in 2013 but not now - hence Coinbase haven't scaled but lost share).

I disagree, I think people here do understand the difference. The entire point was to create a system to barter without IOUs. 
You do realise there is a finite amount don't you? 
That transparent centralised ledger with single entry accounting from a mesh net of hardware verification has a purpose, being to prevent double spending and centralised control of supply, verification and confiscation. 
What is fiat backed by aside debt and taxes? Fiat is forced and Bitcoin is chosen for good reason. It's popular because it allows you to have complete control over access.
What i meant by Bankers interpretation is they don't understand what a blockchain is as they haven't read the 8 page white paper and have echoed Blythe Master's conclusion. I work in London. I get invited to every bank blockchain nonsense meet. It's two years now and they still havent a clue what blockchain is and why private chains won't work.
Ironically their perception of "blockchain technology" is to create 1 centralized database distributed among their competitors which requires trust when they don't trust eachother.

dude anything predictable can be gamed. There maybe a load of people getting in pre halving and out immediately after, there maybe legitimate chinese and south american capital control escape holders, and there maybe a rise after as miners price their coins for sale wrt to their increased overheads wrt reward. There maybe renewed media interest if bitcoin surpasses old highs, or at least $1000. There maybe people sellign before the halving sell on the news etc., there maybe people holding for a greater rise after, guess it depends on buyers and their reasons for using cash elsewhere or wanting to enjoy the ride to new all time highs. Certainly whatever the potential for bitcoin to handle 4 figure valuations is being undeniably proven. 
What matters though is continued development as opposed to discussions on continued development, entrepreneurialism with actual use case, prudcts and services using btc, people staying and purchasing in btc, motivation to circumvent  bank cartels as in the UK (Natwest, Santander, Lloyds, HSBC and Barlclays) purposely preventing merchants from accessing merchant accounts they have an oligopoly on if they handle btc as payment despite it being legal, and continued Banter which makes the whole scene more fun as people realise money doesnt exist.

Over the last four/five years we, the mainstream media (with the exception of this here blog), may have given the impression that we believe Bitcoin will become the currency of the future. And if it isn’t to become the universal currency of the future for every man, woman and child, we may have given the impression it would at the very least become the currency of the future for every operative in the global shadow economy.
As of today, November 1, however, we’d like to issue a small correction. We no longer believe Bitcoin will be “the one”. It turns out Bitcoin is plagued with terrible problems like an inability to scale, developer infighting, Chinese miner concentration, poor mining economics and, generally speaking, far too much transparency to be effective as a shadow economy currency (RIP Dread Pirate Roberts). Our bad.
We now think the currency of the future will be Ethereum, Private blockchains, Monero, Zcash.
We would like to apologise for any confusion caused or any sums mis-invested by the public.
Below please find a flavour of our current thinking, courtesy of a marketing release piece from Nathaniel Popper at the New York Times. You’ll observe that the great thing about ZCash is that it provides early vested interests with a 10 per cent “founders reward“, with 80 per cent of all newly created ZEC going to miners, and 20 per cent of ZEC to the founders for the next four years (you know, almost how banks charge for taking other people’s money and redistributing it for the purpose of creating efficient payments platforms). But don’t be fooled. This is entirely different to how banks manufacture money from thin air. For one thing, banks reinvest the balances raised from the public in real economy ventures to ensure the capital that backs the system doesn’t depreciate over time but is put to work productively, supposedly justifying the extortionate fees they charge. Cryptocurrencies don’t as yet have any intention of doing that. And we salute them for it!
— The Media
From the New York Times:
The company behind Zcash, led by a developer named Zooko Wilcox, has the support of privacy activists and computer scientists at Johns Hopkins University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It has already secured $3 million in backing from a number of Silicon Valley venture capitalists who are involved in the virtual currency industry.
Zcash’s developers say they have used advanced cryptography to create a virtual currency that can be sent around the world essentially without a trace, unlike Bitcoin.
While Bitcoin was initially described as an anonymous currency, its transactions are recorded on a public ledger that can be tracked and traced by law enforcement. Each Bitcoin user has an address, made up of letters and numbers, and the authorities are often able to link an address to a real person using sophisticated data analysis.
In contrast, Zcash uses a method developed by a team of cryptographers working at M.I.T. and in Israel — known as zk-Snark — that allows transactions to be confirmed by the network without anyone recording the Zcash addresses involved in the transactions. Users can opt out of this privacy function.
The privacy features of Zcash could make it harder for the currency to win support from regulators and bankers.
Long live Zcash. And long live the new crytpocurrency messiah Satoshi Nakamoto, Vitalik Buterin, the Zooko.

which is what they are doing because they are viewing their customers as competitors and not opportunities to profit in supply and demand of decentralising and securing the network.
They could make so much more profit producing ancillary products and services for a fairer network that would in turn be of greater value because of it's inherent decentralisation providing greater security.

As the person that kicked the ASIC race of yes the zero sum game we have currently witnessed was inevitable.
Which is why i never understood the fear of the Chinese as their role in this has also been inevitable.
But there is a silver lining, what was disruptive about bringing 28nm ASICs to Bitcoin in September 2013 was that they were 50,000x more efficient than the closest graphics card.
14nm where we are currently is the first true step down from 28nm and Intel only has access to 10nm. It's experimental, crazy expensive and yield is poor. There won't be anything of merit to challenge 14nm for some time. 
So we should see a consolidation of tech at this level with manufacture becoming cheaper and thus mining hopefully more decentralised as long as manufacturers dont private mine and keep the tech solely to themselves.
Really it should only be elec costs that matter now if there isnt a barrier to access and the concept that Ravi (from Cointerra) first suggested (that 21 inc's Balji has suggested) is the potential of mining chips embedded in consumer hardware.
Bitmain has done this with a router, but the hash power is tiny, as a mesh net this has a lot of potential both commercially and security wise for Bitcoin and could only begin to work now as mining tech wont be threatened with new ASIC disruption in the way we have witnessed the last two years.
It would also help if Bitmain didnt add such a mark up to their mining hardware. By and large these companies are charging as much as they can feasibly return in their lifecycle as opposed to a marginal profit over manufacture costs.
It really takes the community to show theres a demand to decentralise mining for a manufacturer to see an opportunity lies there.
Note however from the experience I had selling to the entire community in 2013 and again largely due to the new tech and demand for it many people were a lot harder to deal with than few large customers, but the purpose was to ensure the hardware was distributed as far as possible. 
@_date: 2016-11-02 00:40:32
Gav's great fun, can see why he doesnt fit the corporate agenda, but he was kicked to the curb and no one realises that all the fuck ups surrounding ethereum are down to Joe Lubin greed.

Ok simple Blockchain has two components:
A distributed consensus (more geographic the better)
A time stamp
That's it. 
The purpose is to remove 'trusted' third parties (trust has been abused again and again) and to prevent 'double spending' (electronic data can be duplicated so what prevents digital currency from being respent).
So before Bitcoin, there was always a central party to account for all transactions to prevent double spending, but the issue was we had to trust those third parties and any associates, and well we've seen how that played out with the abuse of currencies and the fusion of banking and state to control.
In a typical traditional electronic payment network there is:
An issuing bank (the buyers card issuer)
A payment processor (all the electronic point of sale and web GUI)
A mandatory clearing house (Visa and Mastercard)
A settlement bank (owned by visa and master card)
An Acquiring bank (the merchant account provider)
A central bank (currency creator and supply/value dictator)
With Bitcoin none are needed. Their 2-5% fee split amongst them on every electronic payment isn't needed. Their 2-5 day delay isn't needed (alright payment is 'instantaneous' but settlement isn't). Their invasion into privacy for KYC isnt needed.
So basically a Blockchain is **a permanent immutable record of all global transactions publicly viewable and verified by a trustless distributed consensus and a timestamp**.
The distributed consensus is a mesh-net of mining that crunch numbers to peek inside an encrypted block of transactions with approx ten minute intervals. They can't change the contents nor the previous history only add the verification of the block to the chain of transactions. Thus the ledger is immutable and verification trustless as more and more distributed verification from other miners compounds the validity.

Not all cloud mining is a Ponzi. Genesis Mining I know for a fact do exactly as promised. 
The issue is if mining were profitable enough for someone to mine with equpment on their own people would still be doing it irrespective of noise, heat and unscheduled downtime.
So if you factor into account cloud mining setups are often not manufacturers so have to sourceable deal, negotiate for a premesis, affordable electricity, fitting out their datacentre, security and maintainence for a medium to large mine and a profit for their own expenses, time and overheads; customer service, website, etc. Fact is with all the economies of scale in their favour only a small profit exists and is eaten by additional overheads, yet companies like Genesis create an offer close to buying the hardware yourself and cost effective electricity. There are people that profit but it depends on the cyclical nature of price and compteition as to when is best to buy and if its just better to wait and buy on price dips in currency instead.

And i'm not saying Bitmain are doing it all wrong. I like Bitmain a lot, their tech is on point and they have always served retail, but now we are at a potential tech wall where decentralisation in ASIC mining can feasibly start as hardware costs will fall due to manufacturing costs reducing and yield increasing without the threat of bigger pockets jumping to new and better tech every few months. Since 2013 theres been 4 leaps to where we are at, eachtime wiping out the previous gen of tech wrt at the wall elec efficiency.

Unbelievable in the past 24 hours Silbert has New York Times, Bloomberg, American Banker and another mainstream press pimping this scam. Shame he so badly wants to be on the ground floor pushing the next big scam as opposed to pushing bitcoin. 
Paid media and bullshit 'founders, investors and advisors' aiming for a lifetime 10% cut of all issued coins after 4 years at 20% for a coin you HAVE to trust when the entire point of Bitcoin as Satoshi outlines is trustlessness.
Literally all of the trusted team of advisors are the typical faces of alts that missed out on the real early days of bitcoin and think they can start something they can control. It defies all the principles of crypto and I for one am even more happy Satoshi walked and Bitcoin has no central authority.
Worse when the mainstream public get burned from readin mainstream press promising the next big thing then the entire crypto ecosystem suffers because of Silbert's and Buterin's greed.
NOTE: Gavin Andressen is the only 'Advisor' to claim hes not accepted ANY payment and given away his 'founders reward'. He told me this on twitter. Vitalik despite being asked three times has refused to answer.

If you don't think Banks, large corporate entities, shady outfits like R3 and the ilk don't want to see Bitcoin torn apart internally, you're crazy. 
Banks won't mention it out loud but behind the scenes Bitcoin terrifies them, but they will continue their bravado and pretend they are on top of things. Those internally to their corporate structure won't mention Bitcoin or suggest anything truly disruptive as that goes against corporate culture and being on the radar of someone senior to them that might endanger the position they have climbed a ladder for.
They will have their own disputes amongst institutions in whatever non-blockchain permissioned 21st century database they intend to 'share' with eachother.
So the answer to all this is remain level headed, stay calm, really there is no rush. The right answer will surely release the breaks on this sideways trend, the wrong will do worse.
Fact is in an industry (the Bitcoin industry) where we have created hardware in months that consumer ready would take years, to the extreme of silicon tech, where more innovation has been seen in 7 than decades the banks have had, Bitcoin lives dogs years. 
The banks are literally so far behind, anything they do develop, deploy, train staff for, retro fit with legacy data without the luxury of starting from scratch has yet to be created, tested, deployed and then have a decades worth of proven success before even getting to where we are at.
So chill and let's come to a successful solution amicably and reasonably without the drama or the ego, you're just playing into their hands...

R3 has nothing of merit to offer Bitcoin, they began their propaganda claiming the middle ground agnostic and not ruling out bitcoin, before beginning to slate bitcoin openly wherever possible, particularly twitter. This is in stark contrast to most banks that won't utter the work bitcoin. R3 appears to be more propaganda than anything else, a middle man claiming nods of approval from banks and corporate with nothing to show. Blythe Master's 'hyperledger' a non-blockchain permissioned database seems to be the real agenda. This way banks will operate on the same book with a peerage system whereby they all fall inline and obey whoever holds the real keys. For the little people it means they decide whether you get access or are denied access to the database and presumably your funds and ability to operate.
R3 is basically a consortium of tarnished credibility destroying the creditability of whatever it interacts with.
Blockstream is a mix of devs, largely core bitcoin devs that are creating solutions and open sourcing them. Issue here is if the solutions require a fee structure to operate, who dictates fees? Yes its great they run on the bitcoin blockchain, but if some turn out to be blackbox subscription offchain settlement solutions then that involves trust it negates aspects of bitcoin value proposition, namely trustless transactions. That said lightening networks could def assist scaling to a world wide audience that handles microtx.

Hyperledger is Blythe Master's solution to bringing banking database into the 21st century whilst retaining centralised control and permission over who can transact on the system. 
There will be nothing open source about it and the Linux Foundation just sold out their stamp of approval through a backhander.
If you consider a blockchain permits trustless parties to agree via consensus through a decentralised network then you'll realise the banks don't want blockchain anymore than bitcoin.
The merkle tree is the real innovation for them they just hadnt seen a use case of it before as keeping their databases private whilst inefficient works for them.

Banks have runway yet for that to happen. They can certainly manipulate the price with a market this size. Entry for them is easy unless we see rapid adoption. For now tactically speaking it makes more sense to keep the price low and squeeze the miners come block halving, which is ironic as it's the miners who pushed the price down and squeezed themselves in 2014 to prevent further competition.
@_date: 2016-02-03 01:01:25
Banks aren't just full of bankers. I was largely referring to their innovation labs i deal with regularly.
Most employees bankers, back end staff etc don't realise they will be redundant in 5-10 years. Most c-level are just trying to ride that period in their same position as they are that close to retirement anyway.
Any banker is just concerned about employer profits is:
a) they can progress
b) they can earn commission
c) they can lose their position

I answered more succinctly in your PM, but depends, all market like a bargain, but for these to be functionally useful (and to spread bitcoin adoption), and bearing in mind these arent for large sums or for long term cold storage as private key is exposed I think sub $20 reddit and bitcointalk peeps would love these. The personalisation is a touch.
Again may not want to mention overheads here but for these to be printed on waterproof paper, and cut to size, shipped etc and make a profit there has to be some middle ground. Obv volume sold means more savings to consumer, but perhaps make the personal photo type accessible for a small premium and contact brands like coindesk, bitmain, changetip etc and see if they want to have promo bills created for exhibitions andd giveaways. Could be a cool branding tool, something i dunno a pr orientated organisation like the bitcoin foundation should have done if they were legitimately about promoting bitcoin as opposed to self serving.

Is R3 a consortium of tarnished reputation? Is it creating a permissioned database for the sole gain of keeping that consortiums intermediary alive? Has it waged propaganda against bitcoin? Has it coerced developers and been partial to erratic behaviour? Has it supposedly aligned itself with a bastion of open source, the linux foundation to create a private database it controls access to?

Bitcoin has a lot more than blocksize to contend with. The biggest risk to bitcoin is the attempted coup by internal cartels forming and i can say first hand those involved in the Bitcoin Foundation currently were actively involved in voicing the need to create their own cartel in 2013. It's greed and stupidity and a need to take account for others work to fee their own ego and lack of contribution. So i'm very aware of the danger of individuals within the Bitcoin Foundation and Roger Ver.

"Centralisation (British), or centralization (American), is the process by which the activities of an organization, particularly those regarding planning and decision-making, become concentrated within a particular location or group, keeping all of the important decision-making powers within the head office or the center of the organization."
Disagree, you are incorrect, the only reason Ethereum can claim they have a high node count is because they have a lack of web wallets due to lack of real interest from small portion of actual user volume. Therefore the majority of ether holder have to download Mist and the entire ether blockchain, therefore the node count appears impressive. Bitcoin has tonnes of on and offline wallet options and thus fewer of the population download the core application and associated blockchain.
Further the DAO hack illustrated just how centralised ethereum is with fewer than 10% of the ethereum population dictating the hard fork take place to recover funds that were largely in possession of 10 individuals.
With respect to mining centralisation, if you want to blame anyone, blame me, i'm the catalyst for that occurring, but by design it was inevitable. In theory it should decentralise again now that the race to the cutting edge of tech will stagnate for the foreseeable. 14nm is the true step down from 28nm. 20 and 16 was just publicity and minimal efficiency saving. 10nm is in intels lab and the yield is dire. So the previous two years of every few months a new optimised hardware being released has finished and as 14nm becomes more stable and affordable the hardware should in theory dissipate to a wider audience, reducing centralisation as long as electricity is abundantly cheap we find ourselves int he same position as with GPUs and university dorms pre 2013. Whether that occurs is to be seen, mining hardware currently has an outragiously high mark up to retail with most of the mining profits pre loaded in the purchase price. Bitmain and Birfury's hardware once non recurring engineering costs are recouped are several orders of magnitude higher than the manufacture costs and neither are going to produce 10nm for a long time yet.

cool i'll take a read, but this is all fixable, you walk before you can run or you fall hurt yourself and potentially take everything down with you (as has been seen elsewhere).
And its not the transaction count thats the problem, its the fact people cannot get in and out effortlessly which again is the banks operating like a cartel refusing merchant accounts to bitcoin businesses that threaten the status quo.
EDIT: ok read it, and you make valid points but what retail consumers want is the ability to ping £5 to eachother. barclays has an app called ping it problem is no other bank will allow you to fire the money to them so it works barclays customer to barclays customer, and its not as if you are going ask everyone who do they bank with everytime. Its like mobile credit in the beginning you could only get free calls to your network. Thats an example of banks blocking eachother. Yet here today Bitcoin is legal in the UK, however Santander, Barclays, Natwest, Lloyds and HSBC have an oligopoly over ALL merchant accounts and they threaten to remove not only merchants large enough tto deal with these banks that touch bitcoin, but the smaller banks offering merchant accounts that they settle. 
The banks see Bitcoin as a direct threat to settlement and if you look at the 'blockchain tech' mantra they are all focused on one thing: to be the FIRST to offer a solution to international settlement they can control, yet they don't trust eachother so they form these cartels. They do not care about retail and servicing the public, too much noise, too small commission. Hyperledger, R3CEV, Ripple, Digital Asset Holdings and other bankchain solutions are solely focused on one thing despite what you have heard otherwise; International Settlement and the commission they get fro running a system the can control (like they do currently), this is their blockchain solution, and the way they prevent bitcoin from being adopted is to cut off the rails in and out of fiat currency by preventing merchants accounts.
@_date: 2016-10-26 23:29:36


Please read a larger explanation of elements in my response to another chap below.
There is significant risk of attack if bitcoin gets really big. By and large the perception is bitcoin's wings have been clipped by banks refusing to give merchant accounts to bitcoin businesses and the fact european mining manufacturers crashed the bitcoin price in 2014 to prevent the chinese from taking out loans to compete in the mining space (which was inevitable).


Onerous regulations are by idiots on a paycheck (Lawsky), most places are smarter than New York. London has to be smarter, but New York will just turn to waste like Detroit and car manufacturers where as San Francisco embraces the tech. Bear in mind we are in an internet age, financial services are digital, you dont need to be positioned in New York. Wall St only mattered when people had to locate themselves physically in an office.


What Jamie Dimon and Blythe Masters? 
Blythe killed the economy yet the banking world holds her in awe as the law turned a blind eye. She was then positioned to destroy commodities for a bit before leaving to check out Bitcoin. After six months and not reading an 8-page white paper she said; "its not about Bitcoin its about the blockchain". This has been bankings mantra for the last two embarrassing years. 
A year ago Blythe finally stopped saying blockchain and started saying distributed ledger (BTW DAH is all about international settlement nothing else matters to her but trying to centralise settlement), but the damage was done. Now all of banking echoes blockchain without realising why - as no one in a bank has read an 8-page white paper. 
That 8-page white paper and observation of BitTorrent and file sharing is enough for those that understand it to realise Bitcoin is here to stay which is why Bank of England and UBS heads of innovation have recently left their cosy positions to pastures new, with the Bank of England chap, Robleh (brilliant guy, one of the few to actually impress me) leaving to join the Bitcoin Lab at MiT and the CIO of UBS creating his own consultancy.

Look over your shoulder at all times, trust no one.
But seriously to increase adoption at grass roots tell people about it, get local bars, restaurants to accept it, best way is to ask ahead of time and offer to walk them through opening a bread wallet and pay them.
On the web the most irritating tactic for banks is if you see any twitter posts about how visa or hsbc are trying to win you over and then counter them with something bitcoin related;
i.e. visa says "45 and 60 year olds using electronic web based payments on the rise"
your answer: thats because their 10 years behind and everyone else uses 
thats what i do I piggy back their advertising spend and ensure visibility in the top of their comments with a link to a case of banking fraud. it gets a laugh and costs me nothing whilst damaging their brand. They spend good money to improve their image and spread nonsense about bitcoin, yet we are far bigger in numbers.

u/Luke-jr has committed more time, effort, talent and man hours than multiple Roger Vers. Whilst Luke has a strong religious conviction which he has forced upon people of occasion, dependant on how you approach Luke he does listen. I've never had a problem with Luke and he was super helpful when I brought ASICs to bitcoin in 2013, he also helped with Eligius to ensure we had a pool that was fair and could take the new hardware. 
I tripled the entire network hashrate in September 2013 in three weeks. I had to make sure that stayed decentralised for obvious reasons and in the hands of many not few. Luke helped, freely. He is also super friendly in person despite his stubbornness on reddit/bitcointalk occasionally, he's actually reasonable. Again this is my opinion, from experience, first hand. 
Roger has megalomanic tendencies with a need for attention as can be seen by open tantrums and a fuck you all attitude. There is no reasoning and hed sooner cut his nose off to spite his face with respect to his bitcoin holdings. He has recently damaged the price more than helped, further I have never had a transaction take more than 40 mins and that was from poloniex to kraken where i couldnt change fees, nor do i believe some latency wasnt either of the exchanges own fault.

well Joesph Lubin is selling the ideology of Proof of Stake to the banks as a means to centralise and control the outcome of decisions by holding the lions share, like with fiat, and so far they really like that idea, especially when combined with the fact the stakeholders all gain issuance of new currency and the little people see their holdings devalue through liquidation of currency over time. From what I've hear its Joe Lubin pulling all the strings as Vitalik didnt want to handle the business side or code, so he focuses on systems architecture. Lubin also fired Gavin Wood.

but buddy it was always like that with GPUs, you banked on BTC prices going up (or just bought them) point was GPUs could be repurposed (thats what was so brilliant, everyone had access to at least one cpu/gpu). A lot of old hardware finds its way to Venezuela,in Europe energy prices are extreme so people have always been creative (university etc). But again even with the tech race coming to an end manufacturers are marking up the hardware way over the odds. An S9 is several factors what it cost to manufacture, if Bitmain cares about decentralisation sell it and pass the reward on, theres no excuse.

Mike it's pretty obvious - yes innovation is crucial - but we are fighting a propaganda war where by the latest tactic is to make Bitcoin appear irrelevant and nacsent - and to an extent it works - look at the current public perception - look at the perception of a journalist - Kyle Torpay, Vice reporter, above, completely incorrect and yet his voice carries further. This helps Bitcoin adoption by  fighting the blanket 'smothering tactic' that is being used to silence Bitcoin. This is also in response to the smothering of Bitcoins innovation, highlighting the fact the Banks are colluding to prevent merchant accounts from anyone dealing with the on and off ramps into Bitcoin itself.

Bro ex miner that was largely responsible for bringing ASICs to Bitcoin in 2013 here, my advice is you like to tinker, get an ASUS BTC H61/81 gpu card, some pci risers, 4-6 AMD 480x 8 gig cards (aim for sub 250usd). If you are tinkering you can buy one at a time and play with mining alts. You can pick which you think will be popular ahead of launch etc and just play. These can easily be converted to Bitcoin along the way. Youll get all the fun of mining back in the day whilst not being held to a specific currency and gain the education you want. Really despite the ASIC revolution no one made more of a return or had more fun than those with GPUs. There isnt a decent alternative to bitcoin the currency but you learn heaps from GPU mining that will at least pay for itself. Further you can follow all the 21 Co tutorials with this set up. In effect their 21 computer is a raspberry Pi with a mining chip, but at least the set up i have described as resale and can be repurposed and you wont lose funds on. With the 480 cards for 6 you should be looking at sub 1000w too which is manageable from both heat and cost.

Vitalik sold out Ethereum to Joeseph Lubin who has in turn caused and capitalised the premine (Di Lorio), banked $60 million, sold out Ethereum to the corporates and the banks through Proof of Stake and lead a huge propaganda campaign against Bitcoin. Vitalik is an old school Bitcoiner gone astray :(
@_date: 2016-10-01 19:09:40
i saw that but what does it mean?
@_date: 2016-10-20 00:45:45
they should, Joe Lubin is selling ethereum to the banks as a centralised permission based ledger when they move to proof of stake. 
With a large enough share you too can control, outcome and direction of the platform going forward under the masquerade of voting whilst ensuring your stake gains more of the newly issued currency and the little people without  a quantifying staking amount see their holdings devalue over time. just like with fiat. Hillary would love that. 
@_date: 2016-10-05 17:35:17
Ethereum is a trojan horse for the big banks. Proof of stake transitions the distribution from a decentralised consensus to something where the largest stakeholders see their holdings grow and those with less than stake see their holdings value diminish (rem uncapped supply), whilst simultaneously ensuring stakeholders have control over decision making of platform and profit from everyone else expense.
The Cabal of banks you see connected to the financial crisis, R3cev, hyperledger, ethereum and Ripple are trying multiple attempts to claim Bitcoin is an old tech and they have a fair solution (after paying off Linux Foundation so they can claim open source).
Ethereum just allows them to say look it wasnt us it was the geeks but we like their world computer its better and fairer and we stand behind it hence we are impressed with how they handled the dao and and are investing heavily. Santander is the noisiest of all the banks in this sense and are desperate to be behind the solution all their competitors agree to use, problem is none of them trust eachother.
The other issue is they are only really interested in first; international settlement (biggest bucks control access to all your competitors), and second; identity. They could give a shit about retail banking unless they can score you and get you in more debt (hence identity).

No, fact is Luke builds, and Roger publicises. Roger's gained attention by having significant skin in the game. One might argue I have more of a say as I built something that changed the network forever. Simultaneously I brought more press on board and upto speed at a crucial time for both the network and its price and handled myself and the subject with dignity and responsibility. I have an ability to converse to people from all backgrounds from the public to the socially inept coder so publicity was very much my forte as well, but the fact is im not an expert in all areas and i dont claim to be. I stand back take account and consider the outcomes, i'm not belligerent. Luke's inter personal skills arent his forte, Roger's are, yet Roger has a massive ego, agenda and is belligerent and is behaving like a child currently throwing his toys out of the pram.

Strategy for ZCASH: 
1). Lose a few BTC to pump dust and give impression of actual value. If dust looks to have value..
2). The perception becomes zcash has value - so throttle the mining reward to purposefully limit liquidity of available supply. 
3). Launch a pump and dump alt on the cheap duping media and using the Coindesk media company you recently purchased to influence (dupe speculators) 
4). At the same time removing all the trustless elements of Bitcoin that makes Bitcoin so revolutionary because that's not important specifically when it comes to privacy /s. Just trust a centralised party behind it not to manipulate available supply (like already is being done - see point  and not be coerced or corrupted (note Zcash is a corporation based out of privacy friendly US). 
5). Surround yourself with upstanding members of crypto community who have absolutely no experience in pumping previous shitcoins /s: 
6). Profit shorting the shit out of its release:  
7). Profit based on zero to minimal investment by just helping yourself to 20% of all mining reward for 4 years. 
8). Screw credibility: Rinse and Repeat.

Bruce with all due respect, some of the Foundation have performed some superb work, but let's be honest more prominent members have misappropriated funds and behaved with agendas that haven't exactly been inline with bitcoin first, let alone their own prior history being spotless. 
It's not just to be negative and you know that as far as foundations go, the bitcoin foundation is worthy of being singled out for it's past behaviour. 
All of what you list can and was done on a limited budget due to the money donated being squandered. We are aware of the disputes and the publicly aired arguments that made it harder than it seemed, largely because of those involved, not the nature of running a public body being difficult. Whose intentions were inline with the public it was created to support are strikingly clear as a number in 'prominent' positions have used them to serve their own prestige as opposed to provide a public body for Bitcoin.
Again this isn't a personal attack on you Bruce, but certainly others you were around. Even today the site can't be accessed by those with http blockers as it's not secure, which is incredible considering the tech and privacy focus of the currency itself.

they did go after bitcoin. From the very beginning their narrative was attacke and claim 'etherum is the only game in town'.
They pissed the large established community off and then turned coat and started lying, insider trading and making false promises. Selling out to banks as specifically a bitcoin replacement they could get on the ground floor on. 
Joe Lubin tried to buy bitcoin media, did buy the mainstream media, manipulated the price in the first half of the year preventing it from devaluing and generating hype.
Then the DAO happened and more media bashing bitcoin as a means to distract from the monumental fuck up and try to convince people that hard forking was right to save his own investment.
Now more of the same it's BS they've burned the only thing that matters trust and trustlessness. They cant be trusted and their platform is no longer trustless and immutable. 
No store of value. Records that aren't permanent, ever increasing supply (Lubin's design) and Proof of Stake enriches the richest with issuance of new currency and gives voting rights over the entire platform, at the cost of devaluation of total holdings of anyone below staking amount. Basically they've invented electronic fiat to appease the banks.

yeah that's nonsense as by that math the unlimited group would only require a marginally significant portion of 10% of the entire population to represent the entire 100% which is what ethereum did. 
Never mind the fact that 10 wallets of the DAO contained over 50% of the funds and they all reside in the 10% of the entire ethereum population sampled to force the issue of seeing their funds return at the expense of ethereum as a store of value.
(aside the fact it's limitless supply designed by Joe Lubin who owns more ether than anyone else and likely had more dao than anyone else and is selling ethereum to the banks as the permissioned ledger they want when they migrate to proof of stake - large stake holders make all the decisions, no need to sample population anymore, rich get richer as issuance of new currency is rewarded to stakeholders and those holding less than a staking value - general population - continuoulsy lose value - just like with fiat).

Roger has a monster ego that needs feeding. He has a tonne of coins yet insists on damaging the reputation of Bitcoin and pumping alts at the detriment of his own investment.

can you make a more rugged waterproof version that can actually be taken around with you. I hate the fact product designers (not pointing any fingers just general design) dont appreciate usrrs want to treat electronics like shit. Best computer i ever had was a toughbook, the freedom of putting a laptop in with wet towel and clothing from gym and not worrying about how i treat the bag is extremely liberating. As is i wouldnt trust my trezor on a keychain or anywhere but my house. Ledger has taken a greater step with respect to convenience as to how their device now resembles old USB drives that attach to keyrings. Please sort this out it separates your device from being functional and actually usable to the larger population (the exact opposite companies like Apple behave - they make a large chunk of money on predictable repairs from their users as opposed to providing them a genuinely useful product)

You are focusing on trace amounts when you question was has it occured, and in your own document, which it has. I'm not remotely interested whether it was trace amounts or more:
MR. RAVICHER:  Yes, your honor. We include that in our complaint, which the district court ignored. The Runyons are a perfect example of people who were contaminated and accused of patent infringement by Monsanto. Monsanto’s representative was included in that story and did not deny the allegations, merely saying that “we have a policy not to do that”. Well, your policy is not more binding that what you actually did. Put yourself for just 30 seconds in Chuck Noble’s shoes, or Fedco’s shoes. You are a farmer, you’re not a lawyer. You are not an expert in patents. You don’t know anything about patents. You are just trying to provide products to your customers. You know the well-documented history of Monsanto aggressively asserting its patents. Yes, against most farmers who were intentionally using their seed, but also against some farmers who were contaminated. What would you do? It is reasonable for you to then say: “Well, I have to adopt expensive genetic testing to make sure that I am not contaminated. I have to stop growing certain…”
 
JUDGE DYK: I don’t see that there is a clear example of a situation where they have sued somebody where there were trace amounts in the crops. There is the Schmeiser case in Canada, on which you rely. That seems to be a situation in which, if I recall correctly, in which 60% of the seed was contaminated. But what is the example where they sued based on trace amounts?

Ethereum has a massive centralisation issues and is way more centralised that Bitcoin, what the actual **** are you smoking?
Ethereum has a tiny user base of predominantly Microsoft employees (around 2,000 according to the chap leading the development at their UK office). Look at their daily volume post DAO. 
Ethereum is run by Joeseph Lubin who came up with their ridiculous distribution policy. 
Joesph Lubin (ex Goldman Sachs) was not a founder though claims to be (though he founded Consensys). The founders are Vitalik, Gavin and Jeff. End of 2013 beg of 2014 Ethereum was to be released in Jan 2014, but Anthony DiLorio convinced Vitalik to presale and crowdraise against Gavins wishes. They attended all the conferences and along the way picked up Joe Lubin who became the biggest donor of $1m usd (he made $60m from this) buying 3 x 500btc tranches. They then spanked the money on drugs, travelling, parties amongst other things with a team located all over the globe. They pissed through the money and little dev work occurred. They went cap in hand to a load of banks and private equity and were laughed out and torn a new arsehole in some cases for the misappropriation of their $18m. Along the way Joe gets Microsoft on board, they take advantage of the fact the banks dont understand the tech and promise this world computer nonsense. The banks are only interested in permission based distributed ledgers and interbank clearance (even though it has taken this long for them to realise this). Proof of stake is where ethereum goes fully centralised, handing all the power in decision making and issuance of new currency to the largest stake holders (btw over 50% of the dao was purchased by around 10 wallets). Those with out a staking amount (the lions share of the public) see the value of their holding continuously devalue as the largest holders receive issuance of the new currency by its un capped design (by Joe Lubin the largest holder). This is being sold to the banks as a means to take full control (just like with fiat) and they get to say a group of geeks created it (as the banks are having major trust issues amongst themselves). Santander has been pushing for months to be the centre of a solution having bought into ripple (by the way they think Ripple is decentralised too according to their head of innovation). Gavin and Joe hate each other. Joe Lubin fired Gavin and has been involved in propping ethereums price up for most of 2015 and 2016. Vitalik doesnt want to be involved in the business side and hes not coding, so hes an architect, but by and large they use him for a public face.

The guy has gone above and beyond to get his head around Bitcoin. His papers are excellent and the reason the Bank of England are miles ahead of the US Fed and JP Morgan etc. I'd actually go as far to say he's the only person in corporate i've met so far that gets Bitcoin. He has a genuine interest in the subject. MiT media lab has done very well to get him and i'm super impressed that Robleh has bailed on fiat.

No I very much doubt Vitalik would be unwelcome if he added to the discussion. He's always been welcome.

Coin Journal and Bitcoin Magazine. I know the people behind both of these. Oliver is a stand up guy and David is a great laugh.
Coin Journal has probably the most incorruptible news. Bitcoin Magazine is the most organised.
Coin Telegraph will print any 750 word article you like or give you a 250 word interview with questions of your choosing for $80 USD and have totally sold out to anyone that wants to shill.
Cryptocoin news is spammy and pushes clickbait.
Coindesk is obviously sold to the highest bidder. Its a dead company that doesnt make money uness used to pump alts.
Note the owner of Consensys, Joe Lubin tried to buy one of the big Bitcoin focused Media companies just over a year ago before Etherums Launch and Vitalik and Mihai were trying to prevent the sale to the now owner. The only reason for that attempted sale to occur was for Consensys and Lubin (who runs Ethereum) to tarnish Bitcoin (as they have done through other media - look at all the praise ethereum beat bitcoin press immediately issued on the day of the fork only hours after e.g. Vice). All pre scripted. 
Of the mainstream press, Forbes is pretty damn good at making an effort. Bloomberg is pretty poor, most of its journalists dont understand the tech. Financial Times is a laughing stock. Economist may do a good article. BBC can be pretty impartial and try to get the tech. Guardian has done some good piece. Wall St Journal is completely hit and miss, still doesnt understand the underlying technology. Chicago Tribune was way ahead. Business Insider will print what you pay them or is clickbaity. Engadget can be good. Tech Crunch is hit and miss, makes a good effort but authors are confused and again overly wants to appear an authority when knowledge gaps are present. Deutsche Welle has had excellent and incredibly idiotic journalists (bitcoin funds terrorism).

ZCash is a centralised comapny based in Oregan. It raised 750k investment from 30! investors who happen to run small vc and exchanges (coinbase, shapeshift) and be core devs on competing platforms (ethereum).
The fundraise was just a closed group giveaway of tokens as equity without a position in the company for guarentees of lisiting on coinbase, shapeshift and a few other handshakes.
With respect to this group do i think people will make money from zcash?

Singular DTV is Joeseph Lubin's (real guy in charge of Ethereum) attempt at centralising a Media Platform asfter being denied the sale of a Bitcoin Media company he tried to buy over a year a go (ironically with Vitalik and Mihai opposing the sale to its now current owners in attempt to delay/prevent sale to anyone but Lubin).
Lubin had no interest in buying a Bitcoin based media company for any other reason than to tarnish Bitcoin (which he has been doing all year - note all the press Consensys - his company - orchestrated praising ethereum and slating bitcoin on the day of the Hard Fork).
Singular DTV is being pitched as decentralised and it's not. It's an attempt by several parties to gain control of a media platform for their own agenda just like Silbert and Coindesk.

No right now we are in a flush out stage with respect to miners. Elec and datacentre contracts dont all end on the halving day, so some old hardware will still mine till those contracts expire. Some people bought into btc expecting a doubling on the date itself - don't know why, just due to propaganda apparentlty op thinks the same. Miners dont all sell immediately so some will hold back till scarcity drives the price up further. With that in mind there was a surge of interest anticipating a rise pushing price up prior and if past performance is anything to go by the real move occurs further down the line as the halving impact on new coin distribution settles typically in 3-12 months post halvening.

Yo, goto meetup 
Join **Coinscrum** (the best all crypto, obv predominantly Bitcoin, at 93 feet east every two weeks). Loads of humour and serious issues. Better than the US meets i've been too, almost as good as the Berlin meets I went to in the past (a couple of years back Germany had the best bitcoin meets of anywhere).
Every two weeks they have a speaker, professionally organised, outdoor barbeque, recorded and edited to wacth after by guys in the sapce that know their shit. It's the heartbeat of London's crypto community still relatively untapped by company people, which just goes to show you how uninterested companies are in getting to grips with 'blockchain tech' - because they mention bitcoin i think a lot of company types avoid it, which is their loss as this really is the best in London's Crypto, fin technology and future blockchain usage. For devs, experts, ompanies in the space and newbies its free and super friendly, lots of banter, laughing at eachother, the space and even the odd quiz. Finishes with drinks and sometimes frequenting other bars. In summer theres outdoors as well. No one takes themselves seriously and its probably why this group is light years ahead of anywhere else.
Guys that run it are super cool, Paul Gordon is a gent, Tomer is pretty quiet and good for conspiracies, Louis hides stuff in his beard and has a pet called Mike.
 
**Nomad** - Nothing special, last one had Vinay Gupta telling stories. 
**Ethereum** (generally at Imperial college), all talks have been shite though, gen by 'academics' and 'professionals' - basically no one thats been in the space long enough to understand anything, last talk was on fusing blockchain with 3d printing, chap had printed cufflinks and I had to tell him what he'd printed them with. 3d printing was the stronger of the two subjects as well. The meetup fills up quick and is largerly filled by studednts who have been misinformed that this topic is something they should focus their studies on, the look of confusion in the room is on 99% of faces. Don't expect anyone to have knowledge of finance, decentralisation, trustlessness, immutability, blockchains, merkles, anonymity, dark anything, tech, double spending, consesensus, etherum polictics or bitcoin. Stephen Tual is the orgainsier but he never attends. 
**ETC Classic** - their meets have been quite good, etc host Avtar is solid, but last minute organisation on both events. Last one was at microsoft, beers and nibbles. Hoskinson was pretty entertaining. Microsoft host (ethereum fanboy) still doesnt get blockchain but was trying. One before had some twit climing to be a veteran in the space having worked and barclays and R3. He managed to say blockchain about 30 times in 30 seconds without having a clue it has anything to do with distributed consensus and time stamps. I walked out along with half of the room at this point. 
**Ethereum Codeup** - Not been but know the organiser, he's really cool and enthusiastic, but is pissed to see what the foundation have done wrt dao, he doesnt own much eth, just enough to code with and hes a coder at heart. So if you want to learn/play with solidty this is a bi weekly event in Finsbury Sq. 
Theres the **bitcoin conference** in Old Billingsgate in November but i think the price is quite steep now. Coinscrum has an after party on Nov 7th i think (Sunday imm after the conference, 93 feet east, brick lane - which is buzzing on Sundays). There will be lots of people from the space in town. prob your best bet of the next month.
**Women** in Bitcoin (not for women only), havent been yet. Going to next one just to see if there are any women in Bitcoin. 
Numerous **Blockchain meetups** (wank - load of company men/women wanting to claim an authority on a subject they dont know about), often day times, gen with free food, coffee. Gen rule of thumb if it says 'blockchain' in the title, it's going to be misinformed nonsense. Some of these cost +£200 a day to learn nothing, most attendees like to giggle if bitcoin is mentioned. Santander thinks Ripple is decentralised.
**Hyperledger** - come check out IBM fumbling around naked without a clue. the driest of all the meetups lots of false authorities a host who doesnt have a clue and cant public speak. IBMs San Francisco Hyper Ledger group spent the best part of an hour demonstrating they cant share a sceen on google hangouts, and a banker who wanted to tell everyone over and over that he owns a yacht and charters it out claimed to have solved Bitcoins scaling by creating a shipping blockchain that transacts faster than Bitcoin and isnt even meant for financial transactions. I ask how he verifies if not using proof of work, and after some uncomfortable bullshit from him I point out its not a blockchain and it's centralised by a cartel of shipping companies that process the transactions between themselves, its nothing more than a shared database, he mumbles hed be happy to answer the question after as theres more questions he needs to answer. He also said hed been working in this space long before Bitcoin (but clearly hadnt solved any of the issues with trust bitcoin has). Theres is free pizza and alcohol. Actually the pizza here was better than anywhere else, but the alcohol runs dry quick. Organsier has been cool to deal with, but admittedly not even he turned up to the last one.
**Some coding and climbing thing**, great fun if you like climbing.
**Open Bazaar** not been, only had one I think; 
**Gen 'fintech' events**, may cover crypto, if they do they are brainwashed by blockchain and typically follow the corporate narrative about not understanding crypto, giggling at bitcoin, having women calling themselves 'fintech queens', no one wears google glass anymore, and at least in the UK no one calls themselves an evangelist except some chap at deloitte but hes confused.
Theres lots more on meetup but as yet they are just collecting members and not holding any events or doing anything. Most people in the scene just meet at coinscrum and bounce with eachother as and when. Theres loads of places in London to just do impromptu meets and knocking of heads, i.e. climbing, drinks, coffee, free workspaces.
Also check eventbrite, but largely Blockchain B***s*** with charged events to watch a load of cluesless company people waste a day on learning misinformed nonsense from someone who doesnt get the subject themselves wanting to make several hundred pounds per attendee.

you do realise there has never been a real fair decentralised currency? yet scaling centralised tokens of perceived values are a dime a dozen. Yes you protect the competitive advantage or you are just another alt,  like ethereum.
Bitcoin did just fine pre 2015 and it wasnt a failure, what you are arguing about is a current limitation not failure. Failure to grasp the majority of the globe, a temporary failure, that is being worked on to be resolved but not at the cost of it's core virtue of trustlessness and incorruptibility which sets it apart from other currencies. For now the 'tech' is too unfriendly for mom and pop to handle the responsibility of securing the funds themselves without a failsafe anyway, so theres a lot more aside block size to factor into account when you speak of scalability.

It was a mix of the interest from Asia and the ASICs coming to the scene. I brought the race to 28nm ASICs to bitcoin in Sept 2013 unless you had our hardware mining was no longer possible until the competition caught up in Jan 2014, but the real catalyst to ASIA's interest had been sparked by the ECB closing banks in Cyprus and stealing the money of Cypriot pensioners and Russian and Chinese cpatial flight that bought Cypriot passports as an entry to Europe. They crossed a line and Bitcoin as a safe harbour became a lot more real as an alternative.

wouldnt be so sure, the banks like the story that some 'geeks' made it (banks have competitors that take issue with anything that appears made by another competitor), they like the weak link in the chain being eth foundation via consensys.

disagree, currently they do yes, but bear in mind its been a race to the front of silicon tech; 14nm as the entry of ASICs were a disruptive force in 2013. The last race was to 28nm (which I was responsible for, won and as a result kicked off the chinese landrush into mining). 14nm is the next true step down from 28nm, everything else inbetween, 20, 16 finfet has just been some efficiency optimisation, but not a full node. Intel currently experiments with 10nm which is way off before the yield is stable. So now we are at a stage where mining realistically can be distributed amongst individuals again as the case for a small group with access to fabs and cheap elec is less of a competitive advantage as everyine is stuck at 14nm for the forseeable (where as the last 3 years each jump to new chip has been approx every 6 months).
Cant deny cheap/free elec being a factor but it was with GPUs and university dormitories too. I also cant defend manufacturers marking up the prices of their hardware to close to breakeven of their lifecycle. Fact is Bitmain could sell their kit significantly cheaper.
There is no valid reason for not seeing mining becoming more decentralised again now the ASIC race has ground to a halt.

Look this is just a consumer device that happens to mine, not a mining device that's made for consumers. It's so irrelevant to mining for profit, the purpose is what it is a device you likely need in your home for sharing wifi that also secures the bitcoin network by adding some minimal security that in numbers is significant.
A couple of years back i brought 28nm asics to Bitcoin and tripled the hashrate in 3 weeks. This in itself kicked of the ASIC arms race where for the last couple of years big farms based in china have dominated. Now 14 nm is the next true step down from 28nm and 28nm is obscelete. Intel has 10nm but the yield is poor and its way off from being production ready let alone the upfront costs required. 
However 14nm will come down in price and we are at 14nm for some time, so the decentralisation of mining can happen. After i left the mining side, i did end up in Cointerras office speaking to Ravi who mentioned the idea of chips imbedded in white goods.  Balaji of 21 has suggested something similar. Bitfury didnt quite get it and produced an overpriced lightbulb that never made it into production (like the shipping containers), but with this Bitmain has taken the first step (after 21's computer which was more about learning to code). 
I'd like to see more things like this, but like Bitmains overpriced miners (where the value of its usage is charged significantly upfront), a better deal for the consumer needs to be made, there is no reason that the unit couldnt have a couple more chips yet still warrant minimal additional power consumption and provide the owner with a bit more btc dust as a reward.
Also once bitmain's upfront costs for the new chips has been offset they should really consider lowering the price of their miners for true decentralisation of mining and of the coins themselves.

Ok, no shit take some LEGO, people really start to get the blockchain when you associate it with LEGO bricks.
Watch the video 'Bitcoin under the hood'.
Understand you are focusing on preventing double spending of electronic money and trustlessness.
Highlight how through taxes and a cartel on merchant accounts you are forced to use fiat and trust unnecessary intermediaries. 
Prove that a bank is an unnecessary intermediary and bitcoin's blockchain makes them redundant.
Highlight bitcoins network grew through using the cpu and gpu of common computers everyone had and rewarded people for the uptime.
Prove with data mobile penetration is growing in developing world and these people skip the iterative design process, now people can trade borderlessly.
Now get everyone to download a wallet. Send $1 to one student, get that student to send it to another member in the class and repeat.
Whilst at the same time assign another student to try and open a bank account online.
They get it

Someone pointing an ASIC and crossing their fingers, but considering i'm largely responsible for tripiling the cumulative hashrate of the previous 5 years since bitcoins inception the month before (September 2013) and for kicking off the Asian arms race in mining I can assure you no one in October 2013 was mining a block for anything other than an experiment unless they had their own pool. Perhaps the first and second batches of Avalons much earlier but the train had well left the station after.

Trezor firmware updates are for Trezor.
Keepkey updates are for Keepkey.
I know this sounds obvious, but essentially keepkey took trezors open source code and wrote a chrome extension and incorporated shapeshift, where as Trezor created the proprietary underlying tech and whilst open sourced it any future revisions are written with trezor in mind. Slush and crew have gone for the addition of a password manager recently. Whether any important patches or fixes occur in future is to be seen, but keep key have to either play catch up or innovate themselves. Ledger has the most rugged design though.

Yup this is why Proof of Stake is being offered to the banks as a means of controlling the access and direction of Ethereum after the transition. 
The largest stakeholders control the project(s) at the expense of the smallest stakeholders who see their holding devalue as the stakeholders gain the issuance of new currency.
Therefore proof of stake becomes the permission based distributed ledger they want with control over access and money supply devaluing over time - Just like with fiat. 
Hence the interest and involvement of Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Santander, Microsoft, IBM etc. With the story a group of geeks made it and they honestly had nothing to do with it..lol!

it depends on how informed the recipient to this information is. Roger is not technically qualified, but he can surround himself with people who are, however he's currently surrounding himself with people that agree with him as opposed to those that are willing to challenge his perception and enable him to find a common ground. He has no interest in finding a common ground. For instance the other day he stated that big blocks are great for the bitcoin price as an increased bitcoin price means the miners get more profit which is not true. The transaction fee is discretionary albeit the minimum currently set in place, but the block reward is dependent on the hash power you as an individual have if going solo, or as a portion of that you are pooled mining with. When price increases so does hash power as more hardware inevitably comes on line in competition. The profit is remainder of the bitcoin price once hardware, manufacture and electricity costs are factored in. If the profit margin widens the competition increases. Point in case the drop in bitcoin price throughout 2014 had numerous factors, many journalists voiced their opinions, but a large portion of the drop around significant round figures (where stop losses were in place) was due to the paranoia of European mining manufacturers dumping coins on the market to prevent Asian loans being taken out to be realised as future competitors (inevitable as they get mates rates on components and cheaper electricity). Instead of focusing on selling as much hardware as they could and retaining Bitcoin decentralised mining capacity they focused on building their own mines suppressing the bitcoin price because there was too much profit in a high bitcoin price at the time.

No it became a fight for survival as Eth Foundation mismanaged funds from presale. Eth (via Lubin) courted banks and private equity and before launch and were laughed at for the mishandling. The tune changed when the struck and agreement with MSoft, IBM and the  banks realised what they are after is a permissioned ledger disguised as a blockchain they control but was developed by third parties.
The transition to proof of stake from proof of work along with the uncapped supply (an idea by ex-goldman sachs Lubin) means that those holding less than a staking amount have no control over future direction, or gain any share of issuance of new eth, whilst their holding constantly devalues (just like fiat money) - so in essense the banks get exactly what they want which is just how they have it - control over supply and access whilst supporting a propaganda narrative that bitcoin is an old tech.

I'm going to refer to a comment I made earlier on another thread that was ignored, explaining why the Swiss Central bank is not against Bitcoin: 
"See the Swiss have this approach our money's sound we can use Bitcoin as a financial tool.
If anything the Swiss currency has always had held itself back for other currency pairs. So Bitcoin suits them. Its not a threat to the Swiss currency they are just a healthier performing local alternative to the world's reserve currency.
In some respect the fact it's now available for purchase at every nationally owned ticket machine in every train station in Switzerland is better, as the Swiss government are actually allowing Bitcoin available for purchase for every man, woman and child that lives in and visits Switzerland in the most convenient locations.
It was tagged to the Euro for ages as they wouldn't be able to trade internationally with the Swiss Franc performing so well out of the financial crisis as major currencies devalued around it. It was not subject to quantitive easing. And you can rest assure there's a fair amount of physical gold in Switzerland too and unlike the US Fork Knox, it's accounted for."

@_date: 2015-11-22 15:22:41
I think you are missing the point. The greed in mining is a zero sum game which ends with access to the most cutting edge tech. 
Leapfrogging from GPUs that can solve many mathematical calculations at once to a specilised piece of kit that solves one dumb algo more efficiently requires large upfront cost that could only be justified as the network grew with interest and userbase. 
What i mean is leaping from GPU to 10nm bespoke ASIC was never going to happen, so there had to be a wave of iterative design and  landrush opportunities brought by heading 130nm - 65nm - 55nm - 28 nm - 20nm - 16nm - 14nm to 10nm in effectively a very short space of time, and the hashrate reflects that as does the concentration of companies with access and funding to afford 16nm and beyond.
Conversely with each leap in tech there is less of a landrush grab. Now the hashrate has settled in comparison to 2013-2015 as the speed at which silicon innovation can be bettered only being restricted by price is no longer a factor, there will be delays in access to better performing silicon beyond 14nm. Next year there is also a halving in reward which may effect how these industrial miners operate. We eventually reach a point where 21/Qualcomm's ideas of embedded ASIC mining in consumer products is not so crazy once the profit over elec costs are minimal. 14nm is the next full node down from 28nm. Everything in-between has had some efficiency saving or more optimised design.
The bedroom hobbyists did well in the beginning, replaced by industrial mining that did well in the race to the latest tech, now their profits are squeezed, rationally the concept to decentralise further in everyday goods becomes a feasible hypothesis.

Ok so let me explain to you how this is relevant.
Swiss bank accounts used = privacy
America fucked that up (along with more recently the panama 'leaks') so they could turn nevada, south dakota and wyoming into tax havens. 
Worse for some bully reason they force the swiss to comply to US law (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act) and hand over all detail of US Citizens fucking their privacy model up. So Switzerland turned around and said ok, and as this is obviously to protect US citizens (not, its a grab on private wealth) we wont offer any financial services to US citizens.
Now Bitcoin comes along and everyone can have 'a private swiss bank account' (Obama) - RELEVANCE.
The US want to turn the US into a tax haven grab as much private money as they are desperate for more cash to flow in and will accuse you of being a terrorist if you dont bank with them (not that youll get you money back if you have massive funds, civil forfeiture, assumed terrorism bs etc.)
The US is literally the worst place in the world to store money (we all know this or we wouldnt be here).
This is completely relevant as the article states:
"Many banks decided it would be easier to not accept American clients than comply with the regulations."
So New York Bitlicense Regulation, the sniveling little shit Lawsky that pretended to be a friend, etc. 
Let's see how this plays out, because the US is out cold of a banking powerhouse that respects privacy and didnt fuck itself in the financial crisis (Switzerland).
And ironically New York is out cold of a financial powerhouse that respects privacy and didnt fuck itself in the financial crisis and removes most of their financial cartel out of the equation (Bitcoin) whilst they come to the realisation that private blockchains dont work (hence the ECB announcement during the week).

That's absolutely not true and as a journalist you if anyone should be aware that circumstance varies wildly with respect to use case and geolocation. 
2.5 billion people have no access to financial inclusion, yet have access to someone with a smart phone, as this tech becomes more prevalent the true disruption will be everyone with access to information, services and products they can trade with digital tokens of perceived value.
The developed world has the luxury of a variety of financial services largely targeted at credit and enabling debt and so bitcoin is seen as an alternative in a well-serviced market. Outside of the developed world bitcoin's use case is becoming more and more evident as expected. In the developing world you cant get a bank account without identity and there's no identity not because its an impossibility but because you have no right to the ground beneath you without identity and currently it is more profitable to steal resources from the developing world than offering the financial inclusion available in the developed world where the ground has already been claimed from beneath us.

Yawn, there is nothing new here, i've been attrending the hyperledger meet ups (which are dry as fuck with no one understanding a blockchain is a distributed consensus and a timestamp, worse none of the San Fran Hyperledger guys can even share a google hangouts screen - hardly tech savvy). They had a 'keynote' speaker - a banker that owns a boat - a yacht he charters and hes apparently developed a solution for global shipping and transactions that is faster than bitcoin and scales and .... until i asked him how he confirmed the transactions if not using proof of work, he stumbled around as pointed out it was a basically a consortium of shipping companies that permit access and had nothing innovative at all to possibly rival bitcoin as its a permission based ledger same as everything that hyperledger was demonstrating.
R3 is based at We Work in Liverpool St - they cant raise the 200million from the banking consortium (cartel) for a 10% equity share so are now with their tail between their legs offering their vapourware to their institutional peers in the hope it gets adopted as part of the hyperledger nonsense.
After they jumped on the blockchain hype as Blythe masters said it wasnt about bitcoin, but the blockchain. They realise that open source is a way to get people to freely use and develop, but their open source is not really open source as it still is created for and used by the usual suspects and gatekeepers based around soverign fiat debt based currencies and closed markets they determine who has access to.
TLDR They couldnt get the banks to buy in at the ridiculous valuation they wanted, so open source or nothing

2/2 
“FedCoin” or any government backed cryptocurrency will also have to answer the bell on inflation versus deflation and how and who controls the supply of the coins.  Will a “FedCoin” cap the number of coins that will ever exist?  If they stated a cap will anyone believe them?  How will Central Banks and governments even function if they have to adhere to hard restrictions on the creation of new monetary units?
Crypto Pump and Dump
AltCoins are another very interesting part of the saga surrounding cryptocurrencies in general.  The premise that dozens if not hundreds or thousands of AltCoins could in theory exist to support various use cases or niches seems fairly reasonable but there is also the nagging issue of scale and the network effects.  If very few people use an AltCoin and its trading lacks liquidity it will be very hard for that AltCoin to ultimately succeed.  The reality is more likely that most of the current AltCoins will fail due to lack of use and liquidity and others will come and go over time as well.  That said, there are AltCoins that appear to have genuine intent and motivations supporting them.
The bigger challenge with AltCoins is when there is some type of a profit motivation behind the development of the AltCoin by a closed group of early participants.  Anyone or any group is free to develop what they choose and the market is also free to judge the offering.  Some of the AltCoins making it onto the scene really smell like “pump and dump” schemes and almost like the IPO fever of the internet bubble era when hundreds of companies scrambled to become a Dot Com so they could rush through an IPO.  If it looks too good to be true . . . . . . . .
Any AltCoin that is cryptic about how much pre-mining took place or how much supply of the coins currently exists or will exist or how that is controlled deserves extra vigilant scrutiny.  What are they hiding?  One of Bitcoin’s best features is that despite the existence of large holders of Bitcoin present for years now, there is not a legion of private corporations that claim to “own” Bitcoin or own or control the “Bitcoin blockchain”.  Bitcoin is an open architecture.  There are AltCoins that essentially launch an IPO after a select group of insiders controls a chunk of the coins while simultaneously not being entirely clear about the protocols or potential supply of coins.
The same argument regarding immutability and proof of work noted above regarding private and permissioned blockchains applies to Altcoins as well.  We already have examples of Altcoins making major structural changes after certain initiatives failed to gain traction or perform as desired or expected.  This makes it extremely difficult to gain trust and dedication to investment in a surrounding ecosystem and infrastructure.  Comparing the development around the Bitcoin protocol to that of Altcoins demonstrates how ecosystems are much more likely to grow and mature around an open and trustworthy architecture.
Crazy Theory or The Obvious Truth?
Although some may scoff at this analysis as a “conspiracy theory” the author finds it quite plausible and even highly likely.  The heavily entrenched incumbents and associated “governments” controlling the existing financial system continue to show the world they will ruthlessly commit fraud and engage in criminal behavior while also using currencies as weapons that can impoverish victim nations.  It seems quite feasible that if they discovered stopping Bitcoin in its tracks was not possible, they would simply try other strategies.
History outlines quite clearly that humans will create any scheme or business plan possible to exploit transformational changes as we are seeing right now with Altcoins.  Entrenched incumbents will deploy any strategy possible to delay or impede the adoption of revolutionary technological changes, and this is what we are seeing with private and permissioned blockchains.  “Extend and Pretend” and “Delay and Pray” are two of the strategies powerful incumbents frequently deploy when challenged.  Take that into consideration when evaluating if the world has even seen before something as powerful as Bitcoin that threatens so many incumbents while also offering so much opportunity for others to exploit either ethically or deceitfully.  Also consider that the people and organizations referred to in this analysis could also seek to impede Bitcoin’s progress so that they themselves could accumulate more Bitcoin as a hedge.  If you can’t beat Bitcoin or stop it perhaps your only option is to delay its eventual domination.

Ethereum is a trojan horse for the big banks. Proof of stake transitions the distribution from a decentralised consensus to something where the largest stakeholders see their holdings grow and those with less than stake see their holdings value diminish (rem uncapped supply), whilst simultaenously ensuring skateholders have control over decision making of platform and profit from everyone else expense.
The Cabal of banks you see connected to the financial crisis, R3cev, hyperledger, ethereum and Ripple are trying multiple attempts to claim Bitcoin is an old tech and they have a fair solution (after paying off Linux Foundation so they can claim open source). 
Ethereum just allows them to say look it wasnt us it was the geeks but we like their world computer its better and fairer and we stand behind it hence we are impressed with how they handled the dao and and are investing heavily.

The other issue is they are only really itnterested in first; international settlement, and second; identity. They could give a shit about retail banking unless they can score you and get you in more debt (hence identity).

Bitcoin is legal in the UK, Gov is pro innovation.
5 banks have a oligopoly controlling access to all merchant accounts in the UK - even smaller banks have to go through them (ask Fidor about this). These 5 banks will refuse a merchant bank account to any UK Bitcoin business. 
Guess who the 5 banks are? 
HSBC, 
Lloyds, 
Natwest, 
Santander 
and Barclays (who brought in Saffello to their accelerator and wouldnt allow them a merchant account either)

Well Lubin owns Consensys so anything they do or propaganda they push (i.e. Bitcoin bashing press) is him. Santander is the recent addition to Ethereum's purse. They've been trying the last couple of years to force their solution by buying ripple but banks don't trust eachother which is why Ethereum mishandling funds, running out of cash and begging for help from the banks has given the potential entry for Microsoft, IBM, Santander, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan etc to say this is a solution we didn't invent it and its bitcoin 2.0, world computer, bitcoins old, lets move to proof of stake.  PoS enables the Lubin (ex-Goldman, largest Eth holder) and the institutions like Santander and Microsoft to hold the swing vote and direct how the technology is accesses used and abused by retaining the largest share and gain more of the newly minted currency without a finite cap (Ethereum's lack of cap was Lubins idea - there's a blog post on that). So the rich get richer, and control the voting outcome and those that arent at least at staking level (everyone else/ general population the platform will be forced upon) will see their holdings lose value over time (just like with fiat), ethereum and it's proof of stake become the permission based ledger handing the institutions control over supply and access to 'their' network which is what they want only disguised as a false open source project.

BITCOIN AS DISRUPTOR, BITCOIN REVOLUTION, EDUCATION, REPORTS &amp; ANALYSIS
THE BIG DIVERSION TO MAKE YOU FORGET BITCOIN
OCTOBER 13, 2016 DYOUNG
Most people likely agree that Mahatma Gandhi knew a thing or two about perseverance.  Gandhi offered this to say which can certainly relate to fighting for and standing up for a monumental change you believe in:
“First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.”
It is plausible that Bitcoin will have a much greater impact on humanity over time than that of the internet, but it is difficult to argue that the internet ever faced as many attacks as Bitcoin has and continues to face.  The attacks started out rather superficial and well, obvious, but this analysis surmises that they eventually became indirect, obtuse, and something one might see in an episode of the excellent TV series “Blacklist”.  Entrenched, status quo hugging opponents of anything that can increase economic and political freedom moved past the uneducated and flimsy attacks on Bitcoin to intentionally developing alternatives that are in part designed to slow or impede the adoption of Bitcoin.
The people and organizations behind private and permissioned blockchains, central bank backed cryptocurrencies, and AltCoins may very well truly stand behind their offerings and this analysis is open to that reality.  However, one can’t help but explore that one of the primary motives of these people and organizations is to simply present something, anything really, that will create distractions, fear of Bitcoin, and doubts about Bitcoin with the intent of slowing or even blocking the adoption of Bitcoin.
Private Blockchains to the Rescue
Let’s start with private and permissioned blockchains.  Those supporting private and permissioned blockchains are essentially running with these marketing points:
Bitcoin has tremendous features but you don’t need Bitcoin
Come join us with our private and permissioned blockchain because it’s better and did we say it is “private” and “proprietary”?
We can get other firms on board to help us secure our private and permissioned blockchain so don’t worry about scaling or security or any of that stuff
You don’t need Bitcoin but you really need the underlying technology supporting Bitcoin so just join our consortium and we will tell you what to do and how to do it
It’s not that crazy to think that the world’s major financial institutions would throw a few hundred million dollars of “VC money” into ventures that are promoting private and permissioned blockchains for the financial markets.  These companies rely on the Federal Reserve’s printing press to bail them out in times of extreme stress, lend them money at 0% or close to 0%, and use the Federal Reserve Note to fleece the global economy and its participants.  What’s a few hundred million if it can buy you a few years while people get lost and bogged down in the private, permissioned blockchains versus Bitcoin debate?   That’s pocket change to the Primary Dealers of the Federal Reserve System.
Speaking of private, permissioned blockchains – can anyone actually point one out that is operational and functional?   It remains to be seen if these initiatives ever move beyond vaporware.  More importantly, it perhaps merits close watching to see if the entities involved can trust each other and provide more security than that is provided by the open and public Bitcoin blockchain.   We are already seeing an escalating patent war where various financial firms are attempting to claim intellectual property on various “blockchain” features and technologies.
Let’s also not forget about immutability – one of the most crucial aspects of Bitcoin.  Some may complain about the work and investments required for proof of work and immutability but the whole point is to record and store transactions permanently.  There are numerous cases of banks and financial institutions pleading guilty to various crimes and forms of fraud.  One can imagine these banks controlling a private blockchain utilizing all of their creativity and deception so that they can go back and alter records to cover up more fraud and criminal activity.  Immutability is a tremendous asset and not a liability.  However, it is a major threat if your business model relies on fraud.
 
Behold FedCoin!!!
At least a few Central Banks joined the financial news cycle by touting an upcoming government cryptocurrency or revealing plans to develop their own cryptocurrency.  “FedCoin” is on its way if we are to believe everything the media tells us.  For any Central Bank or government to deploy their own cryptocurrency a potential question to ask perhaps is the following:  Who is going to mine the FedCoin and who is going to support the mining infrastructure for the FedCoin?  Some may respond with “not to worry the Fed will simply print Federal Reserve Notes and pay for the mining itself”.  That argument begs the question of how on Earth this highly centralized FedCoin could possibly protect itself from constant hacks and theft if it literally had all of the mining centralized under the Fed’s watch.  The other major issue is if FedCoin strived for decentralization who would deploy their own hard earned money and assets to build and support mining infrastructure for a cryptocurrency owned and controlled by the Fed or another Central Bank.  That is akin to paying a retainer fee to your bank and credit card to show your support for their fleecing of your assets via fees, usury, and inflation.  It won’t happen.

because blocksize can be handled by repurposing the priority of transaction off chain, settling a larger volume of transactions and then entering the sum of those transactions on chain and maintaining the main chain for the entire ecosystem (bearing in mind all the future smart contracts will also be built on side chains that update the main chain when required which is where ethereum failed by having a token of perceived value on a blockchain that runs all the contracts, meaning when failures occur the entire ecosystem suffers which obviously doesn't work in the real world).

well a huge part of the globe, almost half don't have bank accounts but have mobile phones which pretty much tears up your argument unless you had stated; "The reality is most privileged people with in the developed world with financial inclusion have no need for Bitcoin right now - aside of course capital flight - China, Russia, the Arab world, most of anyone that touched fiat and is limited by movement wrt boarders limiting $10k." 
You are aware the exact moment Bitcoin blew up in the public eye was when the ECB stole money from Cyprus. They weren't after Cypriot pensioners. Russians and Chinese had a means to purchase a European Passport (Full not partial 5 year Visa - only country that allowed that) and freely live and roam around Europe for a €300k investment into property in Cyprus. This was huge as it Latvia was the cheapest entry into Europe (€74k if outside or Riga, €141k inside of Riga - part only for s 5 year temp visa, which you had to reapply and after 10 years give up your original passport). When the ECB crossed that line confidence in banking was gone, hence the interest turned to bitcoin with its genuine use case of securing funds and boarderless travel - A real use case for Bitcoin right now!

Look the fact is you can't ban Bitcoin so most forward thinking countries allow it (or they will lose to innovation). 
The real issue is the banks withholding merchant accounts to companies in the space and preventing ease of exchange from fiat to btc and btc to fiat.
Banks operate a cartel and the way cartels work is they stifle and smother innovation until they can come up with an alternative. 
Problem for the banks is like the governments have realised you cant stop an open source peer to peer movement, only delay it and make it appear inferior - but Bitcoin is just code that works, with no single weak link like an official Foundation that can be coerced (Ethereum and associated alts).

thanks, the concept works in the same way reddit, bitcointalk and bitcoin itself evolved, further its a tactic their marketing departments can throw all the money at to no avail.
All you are doing is fighting fire with fire by highlighting their own deceit, illegal activity and forthcomings where they aim to promote themselves and then offering a healthier alternative to their audience, this in turn generates new interest and makes people look into the subject of bitcoin further. 
You are in effect solving real world problems and highlighting banking's advertising for what it is; manipulating public perception whilst they pay to get the words in front of their audience.
Another excellent visual example is the Paypal superbowl ad that ripped off bitcoin, that was edited to include bitcoin by redditors here. Paypal went nuts trying to get the hacked ad removed, which to be fair did violate their copyright, but with respect to the above, the responses can't be removed as they are not violating copyright, you are just piggybacking their own promotion and highlighting their prior activity and/or pointless existence.

Hi i'm european, London based actually, and have been responsible for bringing both the UK gov and banks up to speed. Banks stuck their fingers in their ears and are regretting that now, the Treasury however listened. For what its worth though the Bank of England last year said they intend to ban cash and have automated inflation added to the currency (1% is what they suggested). 




State would never prohibit Bitcoin. They can't ban Bitcoin that was one of my arguments as the tech will innovate regardless and people would circumvent the UK (look at New York for how that's worked out, they are a laughing stock, look at Russia, the interest soared).






How aould the state ban node operation ffs? How's file sharing banning worked out? Sure an ISP may flag it and but I can use a VPN, Tor, my neighbours network, large private networks like university, just way too easy for the tech savvy to circumvent.






No you are not. In the UK Bitcoin is legal but 5 banks control all merchant accounts and refuse merchant accounts to anyone dealing in Bitcoin. The bullying keeps Bitcoin from being adopted by the general public as a business with public facing sales requires a merchant account. 
Barclays accelerator is infamous for crushing start-ups under the illusion they will help them. Only today Barclays removed the merchant account from Coin Journal. So these banks are behaving in a manner you suggest a government entity might and it doesnt work. Yes it prevents the weak but the savvy will work around it. It limits public adoption sure, but then how many of joe public know how to reduce their tax overheads or gain a swiss bank account?
The public will be the last to adopt anything, they are the bottom of the food chain (sadly they need more reassurance in places they frequent which is why social media campaigns from us are so crucial - go on twitter and whenever a bank or mastercard pay to put an ad in front of you counter it with a smart comment and  they will then be spending money for all their customers to hear more about bitcoin). 
The real concern are those that know how to handle money and conduct business and that is worrying for banks and profitable for governments. As long as governments get paid their ransomeware (taxes) and however much you pay is within their rules they wont ban Bitcoin, but the banks however are desperate not to innovate, all the propaganda that they are on top of things is just not the case. They havent a clue 99% still dont know what a blockchain is and their innovaiton labs are a joke. Anyone that does understand the tech leaves. Robleh Ali has just left the bank of england, UBS has lost Bussman and Baitlin in the past month. They were the smarter of the space and are still involved just not with banks and in the case of Robleh he left the Bank of England for Bitcoin at MiT (and he is really smart one of the few that got it a year ago). 
So the point is a governments roll is to foster innovation, have a bright workforce that pays them back for being allowed to operate within their jurisdiction, empower the young to go study and build the next big revenue generating businesses. 
The banks however are a cartel blocking innovation and under direct threat of Bitcoin. The UK is very different from US Government. It's smaller more nimble and they get the tech. Likewise Switzerland and Japan, no knee jerk reaction there. Thats not to say if Bitcoin's market cap became a real threat they wouldnt consider banning elements, but Bitcoin wouldnt disappear as the tech works, but it may be driven underground, where the tech works. :)

I received the same message. This isn't an attempt to kill the local scene it's just really poor planning by the Hyperledger organiser. I also responded to him as he's mucked those wanting to attend his event around for weeks.
Fact is he meant to run it last month, but is so disorganised he had no speakers or venue secured, but there was interest that he ignored. So he eventually suggested another date without doing any research the same night the main community meet takes place. Ironically on the same night of discussing a similar topic.
Now where he really shows bad character is rather then rearrange for another eve when people pointed out the clash, he's instead come back and said he'll hire a taxi to remove participants from the most established and organised event in the scene to frequent his own (Hyperledger meet) 40 minutes after Coinscrum starts. 
This doesn't exactly show too much compassion to those at Coinscrum who work hard to organise and freely offer an entertaining meetup week in week out at 93 Feet east in Brick Lane by organising a meet on the same day and offering to poach audience. As it turns out the hyperledger meet is still showing unconfirmed speakers aside a guy from IBM, but he's doing himself no favours if he wants to behave like this.

as a rule of thumb you should not use the same address continuously.
Trezor is the best with open source code, plus a nifty password manager, although the weak link is the stupid bit of string and poorly designed lanyard attachment that will break due to the flimsy plastic if you carry it around with you.
Ledger Nano S is more portable and rugged, you can keep it on your keys. It's similar to an old usb drive and has a really solid hole to attach to a keyring.
Keepkey is a trezor clone in a pretty box.
NONE are waterproof/weatherproof rugged yet and it's a real design flaw by ALL companies. The one that solves this with the security in place will dominate the market.
Look up Armory if you want a solid back up with paper option, youll need to create an offline computer (totally offline no wifi or network connectivity) for signing transactions offline with an airgap. Software is free, but requires a day of setup with an online comp and an old offline comp and paper back ups. You can have back ups that require x of y parts for additional security and flexibility.
If useing trezor or any of the other hardware wallets i recommend also purchasing a cryto steel wallet. Note for cryptosteel it may seem like you seed has too many characters, but with mnemonics you need only the first three characters for each word of the phrase.
Paper wallets you must print on waterproof tearproof paper (like the horrible new uk £5 notes) imo and also by a printer that has no wifi or network connectivity (laser ink is best) and no means of storing data. I used to buy an old laser for pennies on ebay, drawback its massive and doesnt have the freedom and functionality for other printing, but great for paper wallets, which should only be used once.

No mate, if you speak in past tense of your peer/rival/competitor that happens to dominating/competing just fine you are making inflammatory remarks; like saying ethereum is "the only game in town" which they have stated on numerous occasions. 
Bitcoin doesn't make such arrogant inflammatory claims as its a bit of code (whose author left to fend for itself) that just works. Bitcoin has no PR firm and marketing team and no bankroll from a vested link to enterprise, it instead has a load of shoddy self-serving egos with shady pasts masquerading as a foundation.

Ok, i'm sure that there is a positioning strategy though, i know the devs in all camps v.well and have known vitalik, gavin and jeff since 2013. I dont have a bad word to say of any of them. Vitalik has always shown great manners and politeness towards me, Gavin is great fun, Jeff is also a kind mannered person in my experience. I dont know Joeseph too well but my interaction have been again pleasant and from all accounts in consensys I have heard he is a great guy to work with. 
From the eth core side however I know that stance is not shared. My personal disdain however comes from witness those leeching on to the concept in 2013 and early 2014 (not mentioning names) when it was intended to be released unfinished to be completed by real community consensus instead derailed for financial gain via a premine and presale that was never the original intent. The ensuing bad money management, time spent at conferences and travelling instead of developing, the fall out as the internal rift occurred breaking the original team up followed by releasing an unfinished product regardless, and now the sabre rattling 'only game in town' bitcoin bashing bs as well as price manipulation when the two could complement eachother as non fiat currency pairs quite well. The bitcoin community never had a bad word to say about ethereum until the ethereum community started spamming and vocally criticising bitcoin in press and on social media platfoms as well as conferences (i witnessed this personally start just before ethereums official launch in a London banking blockchain meet). Ethereum should just put its head down and focus on developing and delivering substance and sort out its own internal friction and provide the crypto community a real trading pair that doesnt involve nonsense alts and fiat and behave with extreme caution making promises of risk free investment and dominance when its platfom will openly run future exploitable code on its main chain. The DAO will not be an isolated case, ethereums Turing complete chain will forever be a target when it has a token of percieved value directly proportional to its percieved health. I personally like the fact bitcoin has this one step removed on purpose as a forethought not an afterthought. Bitcoin's currency element may have been the first application but its store of wealth is both crucial and protected by this and the fact it wont in future confiscate funding 'mishaps'.

A Painful Lesson For The Ethereum Community
After a torrid few weeks arguing about what to do, while the DAO became ever more corrupted due to repeated attempts to recover the money without fixing the code problem that made it impossible to prevent the money being stolen again, the Ethereum community has finally bowed to the inevitable. The DAO code has been rolled back to a point prior to the original attack – a “hard fork”. Ethereum has had its first bailout.
The majority of Ethereum miners have agreed to this. This is hardly surprising, since  a lot of them had invested in the DAO and it meant they got their money back. The puritans who objected to the bailout on the grounds that it fatally compromised the “immutability” of blockchain were never going to win. Accepting large losses for the “greater good” is the province of saints, and there aren’t many of those around these days.
Equally unsurprisingly, the tech geeks at Slock.it are now patting themselves on the back for their genius in solving the problem that they caused in the first place by putting live a bad piece of code after inadequate review and testing. “What an accomplishment!” cries Christoph Jentzsch:
Separate from the discussion of whether a hard fork because of the DAO is a good or a bad idea, the very fact, that the Ethereum community (devs, miners, exchanges, researchers, …) has come together, often setting personal opinions aside, and successfully managed a hard fork in this situation is truly remarkable. Given the time constraint, the fact that we were able to come to consensus on this matter is an outstanding accomplishment.
We are able to hard fork!
Reaching consensus is an outstanding accomplishment, when the majority of people involved faced losing a lot of money if they didn’t reach consensus? Really?
It is frankly unbelievable that anyone seriously thought this was a prisoner’s dilemma. The community had nothing to lose by voting to fork, and everything to gain. The remarkable thing is that there do appear to be a number of holdouts: Ethereum guru Vitalik Buterin says that 85% of miners have voted for the fork. The remaining 15% are presumably either saints or had no money involved.
Christoph’s self-congratulation then heads for the bizarre:
Although some do question the analogy “code is law”. I do not. We just found out that we have a supreme court, the community!
Oh dear. Christoph seems unfamiliar with the concept of “tyranny of the majority”, and the reasons why legal systems in civilized countries generally do not allow a majority of self-interested people with their brains in their wallets to amend the constitution to suit themselves. This isn’t a “supreme court”, it’s a cabal.
The fact is that Ethereum has compromised its principles in order to rescue a client. Or, in the language of another world, the Ethereum central bank has directly recapitalized the DAO commercial bank by monetizing its debts. I could wax lyrical about the incestuous relationship of Ethereum and the DAO that made this decision inevitable: DAO investors and Ethereum miners are to a large extent the same people, and even some coders have money in the game. Moral hazard, much?
That said, there really wasn’t any other viable alternative. The DAO was fatally corrupt. There was no way of bringing the attacks and counter-attacks to an end without fixing the code, but a permanent fix meant a hard fork. I suppose the community could just have written off their investment, put it down to experience and moved on, but….come on, this is banking, really. If you know you might get bailed out if you lobby hard enough, what do you do?
So now the question is – how does Ethereum avoid more bailouts in the future? Well, writing good code and testing it properly would help, for starters. After reading a lot of stuff about how no-one could possibly have spotted the code problem, I had a look at the code myself. It’s not my language (I’m an RPG geek), but it’s comprehensible. That code would not have passed any code review I was doing: it did not maintain the integrity of the data it was manipulating. However, I was of course looking at it with the benefit of hindsight, and even the best code reviewers miss things. But Ethereum needs to be FAR more rigorous about coding standards, review and testing if it wants to be taken seriously.

But there is a wider issue here. Has this bailout set a precedent? In an interview with the Wall Street Journal’s Moneybeat, Vitalik Buterin said it hasn’t, because Ethereum is still being developed:
“I totally get both sides,” Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, told MoneyBeat. He said the reason he supports the fork is that Ethereum is still in development stages, and isn’t fully formed. As it grows, forks like this will be harder to do. “I don’t think the way things are done right now are precedent setting.”
Buterin has just dug himself a very large hole. The unfinished state of Ethereum should have been made clear to its investors – and those who invested in the DAO – up front. No way is it ethical to persuade people to invest large amounts of money in a product whose key selling point is its immutability, then when it goes wrong claim that it wasn’t ready for release and needs to be changed. It’s perhaps going a bit far to call this a scam, but it is certainly weapons-grade naivety to imagine that code thrown together in a hurry without much in the way of testing should even be put live, let alone sold as “immutable”. Seventeen years of working in financial systems taught me that you  just DON’T take such risks with people’s money.
The problem with deciding that Ethereum, and by extension the DAO, are still in development (rollbacks are part of life), is that they are in fact live as far as their users are concerned. Never mind the code, the problem is the data. Data in a live financial system should not be changed. That is true even in existing financial systems. The Ethereum community has agreed to a change that makes their system less trustworthy than a conventional financial system. For a technology that aims to disrupt conventional financial systems, that is not clever.
But even less clever was the decision of Buterin and his fellow geeks (well, if it even was a conscious decision) to test “in live”, taking risks with their user community’s money in order to prove their system. Admittedly it is funny money, but as the funny money is convertible to real money there was always a risk of tangible losses for investors. And as investors didn’t realize they were being used as guinea pigs, bailouts were – and probably still are – inevitable. Refusing to bail them out would be a major breach of faith.
Bailouts aren’t a community decision, whatever Christoph may think. It is the decision of the geeks that matters. This hard fork was only possible because the geeks decided to make it possible. Fundamentally, “to fork or not to fork” is a technical decision. So it is the geeks, not the investing community, that really run this show. But to preserve the illusion that the community is in charge, they have to do what the community wants. And the community wanted a bailout. So they had to provide one, or the game was up.
The “ Vitalik put”, as FT Alphaville’s Matt Klein dubbed it, saved the investors’ bacon this time. Whether or not they would be saved again depends entirely on whether Buterin thinks they should be. And he is hedging his bets. He hasn’t exactly said that this is a one-off, has he?
But people believe what they want to believe, as this comment sequence on the Ethereum Reddit stream shows:
Ethereum bailout
Translation: “Vitalik says there won’t be any more bailouts. And I believe him”.  Such touching faith.
Ethereum is only immutable because Buterin says it is. Until he changes his mind. Which he inevitably will, next time there is a major loss. His investors will expect him to, since – y’know – the system is still “in development”. And he will agree, since – y’know – the community is in charge. It’s all smoke and mirrors, really. Now where have we seen this before?
The Ethereum community is painfully learning why, after thousands of years “in development”, banking works the way it does.

Forbes has been pretty on top of bitcoin before other media. I was profiled by them in 2013 and they were really keen to grasp it, spent a day explaining it to Kashmir, on a Sunday in fact. Theres a mix of knowledge between some journalists but they are streets ahead of the likes of the Finacial Times or Wall Street Journal.

*there, and there doesnt have to be a massive awakening, gradual is fine. The system works and worked before the recent spikes in interest. If the euro collapses will bitcoin stand to gain, for sure. The OP is more concerned about the fed and the effect on US elections, all of which is background news for everywhere else.

Erik I respect you a lot but ethereum has a massive PR machine backed by consensys whose owner bought a massive share of coins very early and is privy to inside information based on the fact he is also one of the later founders, so ethereum really doesn't have its issues generating bitcoin bashing press, here's a selection from the last 24 hours:
Note longtime financial troll Isabella Kaminski whose articles 99% bash bitcoin contines to do whilst praising ethereum, this is from a publication (The FT) that removed any journalists that praised Bitcoin from writing about the subject further (Jane Wild for instance)
“Bitcoin was a great experiment in monetary policy,” says Andrew Keys, the Head of Global Business Development at Consensus Systems (ConsenSys), a venture production studio for blockchain-based applications and tools.
“What it proved was that I can send you a Bitcoin without a bank,” he says. “Ethereum […] can do peer-to-peer agreements.”
Those inflamatory remarks are direct from ethereums camp. What ethereum have done is proven assets are confiscatable destroying ethereums chance of being a long term store of value, they have just repeated what the ECB did to Cyprus, helping themselves confiscate assets (whether the reason was to patch a gapping hole they invited the wrong attention from or not). Banks crossing that percieved line in the sand is what sparked interest in Bitcoin in the public eye in the first place.
With all respect ethereum is of interest to enterprise and developers as a rails for their own developemnt which is why microsoft and ibm arent using the token themselves but bootlegging their own. This fork may or may not improve any future adoption from enterprise but from a personal finance standpoint we now know are funds are potentially confiscatable.
It's also worth noting if this is true:  surely that shows a further vested interest in why he publicly encouraged the fork.

I warned Tual. I'm on record a month before they launched on youtube stating this and he denied. I will find the link.

Christoph’s self-congratulation then heads for the bizarre:
Although some do question the analogy “code is law”. I do not. We just found out that we have a supreme court, the community!
Oh dear. Christoph seems unfamiliar with the concept of “tyranny of the majority”, and the reasons why legal systems in civilized countries generally do not allow a majority of self-interested people with their brains in their wallets to amend the constitution to suit themselves. This isn’t a “supreme court”, it’s a cabal.

Insider knowledge and management decisions/trading dont have to be acknowledged by formal association. The ethereum team is eth core and they split with consensys for reasons of incompatibility arising from dislike of eachothers senior management that previously shared the title of founder. 
Irrespective consensys and the chap behind it operates the links between enterprise association (Microsoft, IBM etc.) and ethereum which in turn bailed them out when they were strapped for cash after mismanaging funds ad being turned down everywhere else. As such it is in consensys interest to see ethereum reach and maintain a 1Billion USD market cap attract new enterprise clients and symbiotically increase in value hence the huge spend on PR. 
Who financed Devcon and its food, drink, parties for an entire week in the heart of London? Consesnys. Ethereum couldnt manage that, secure enterprise partnerships or recent PR without them. Look at the above articles, these were all staged for release post fork, same with the yahoo finance on just released. This isn't Eth Foundation pushing this, it's a company with no 'formal' association.
