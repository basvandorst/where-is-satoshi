Armory requires Bitcoin Core, synced, to check balance.
Alternatively, restore the wallet using the paper backup, and export the set of private keys to another wallet.
Better post your questions to the Armory support board:

I'm a miner. I support UASF with my node and my miners, and so do [many others like me]( - currently 8% on slushpool and rising by the day.
@_date: 2017-07-08 15:09:51
Correct. But that's just slushpool that have a clear indication of UASF supporting miners. That's the bare minimum number that is larger than 0.
Game theory FWIW shows that [logical miners will join](

There is currently a solution to quantum computers cracking sha:
Use a multisig address (addresses starting with 3).
The chances of brute-forcing a multisig private key for QC are non-existent: 1 in 2^256 becomes 1 in 2^65536 for a two signature address. 
There are less electrons in the entire universe than that number. Take that, QC.

Page 16: "Unhosted wallets are software hosted on a person’s computer, phone, or other device that allow the person to store and conduct transactions in CVC. Unhosted wallets do not require an additional third party to conduct transactions." - so they are not MSB, right?
But SPV wallets (all phone wallets) do require a thid party to conduct transactions. Are they MSBs then?

Economic majority is a lot of entities. Let's consider a few:
* Exchanges will probably benefit most from the split. They'll implement replay protection and make money on the legacy-148/148-legacy pair. However, where would they buy/sell their 148 coins? Right, from the miners mining 148 coins - thusly the demand will rise, pulling in more miners and raising 148 price. Game theory valid argument, IMO.
* Shops - Would you rather accept a legacy coin, knowing it MAY be invalidated if 148 takes over and your transaction might be re-orged to oblivion? Logically no, 148 coins won't have that risk - so demand from businesses for 148 coins and rejection of legacy coins will drive up 148 coin price.
* User-to-user economic activity - same as shops above.
* Miners: If you're not out to sabotage, i.e. you're out to play logically, BIP148 coins will fetch higher fees, = richer mining reward.
* Holders: Would you rather buy and hold legacy coins that MAY be invalidated in the future? BIP148 coins are riskless.
The blind side would be an entity out to sabotage the system, such as Bitmain, who could mine secretly on the BIP148 chain, with empty transactions, and publish them after, say 99 blocks, invalidating all transactions that happened on the overt chain.

Although segwit is briliant, its deployment via BIP9 was extremely short sighted - giving miners overwhelming power of vote, and requiring them to vote with overwhelming majority. 
That was a recipe for stagnation, and that is exactly what we got for two years.
BIP9 will never be used again. It was a grave mistake by segwit developers to deploy it thusly.
BIP148 corrects that via flag day. If it weren't for BIP148, SW2x would have never materialized and SW would have been forever frozen in deadlock.
Releasing that deadlock via SW2x is BIP148 single greatest achievement. 
@_date: 2017-06-26 15:40:34


They won't firstly because your basic assumptions are off:
You assume there will be a block split, when every indication right now show they are all supporting segwit (through Segwit2x). That, in and of itself, is UASF most significant achievement: replace BIP9's 95% miner vote with BIP148 August 1st flag day. That's already a success (unless they bluff - more on that below).


**There is a significant chance of success:** there is a large majority of miners [currently 85-90% ]( that intend to signal segwit (via segwit2x) 10 days before UASF flag day - thus locking segwit and avoiding a chain split on August 1st.


The force of this proposal is that if miners are bluffing and come August 1st their intention to signal fails to materialize, a chain split **will occur** regardless of the proportion of the hashing power on both sides. The legacy side stands to lose because:
* There will always be a chance that UASF side wins some time in the future and a re-org will wipe out the legacy chain.
* That chance increases if segwit locks on the UASF side because many, many assume correctly that Bitcoin + SW is worth a lot more then Bitcoin sans SW. 
* That in turn will lead to UASF blocks being more valuable = richer fees = more (logical) miners attraction = preferable coin for hodlers = greater fear of legacy chain wipeout = positive cycle that will eventually result in a successful switch to segwit and wipeout of legacy chain. That's the WC scenario probably.

Dear Diary:
* 2017 July 23 18:00 GMT — BIP91 epoch finishes, BIP91 is activated.
* 2017 July 23 18:00 GMT onward — Every block signals BIP141 (Segwit).
* 2017 July 27 or thereabouts — New Difficulty Adjustment Period Begins (2016 blocks). Every block will be signaling for Segwit.
* 2017 August 1 00:00 GMT — BIP148 starts, but does nothing since every block is signaling BIP141 due to BIP91.
* 2017 August 10 or thereabouts — Difficulty Adjustment Period closes with &gt; 95% signaling and BIP141 locks-in.
* 2017 August 23 or thereabouts — Difficulty Adjustment Period closes and BIP141 (Segwit) is active.
* 2017 November 18 or thereabouts — 2x Hard Fork (scheduled).

In your opinion, does the fact that Segwit2x activates only 10 days before UASF August 1st is a coincidence? 
If so, can you please explain why they chose that date, rather than take more, much needed time, for thorough testing?
Take a deep look at how SW was activated on litecoin. History rhymes.

Here is the game theory behind bip148, and why it would indeed work.
**Initial assumptions:**
* Bitcoin with segwit is worth more than bitcoin without segwit.
* BIP148 hashing power is small, but above zero, so blocks are discovered not every 10 minutes, but, say, once a day.
* BIP148 nodes would invalidate legacy blocks but legacy nodes would accept BIP148 nodes (because BIP148 is a soft fork).
* Miners would tend to follow the most expensive blocks (with highest value and richest fees).
* If BIP148 takes over, the legacy chain will get re-orged and diminish, so any transaction on the legacy side would be erased. So both holders and users would choose no-risk BIP148 chain over legacy chain.
* Everyone knows above facts and acts in its own best interest (basic game-theory axiom).
**Mechanism comes August 1st:**
* BIP148 coin is worth 0. Legacy coin, say about $2700.
* BIP148 block is rarely found, but every user that needs to transact would prefer it for above reason, so fees/transaction would be a LOT higher then legacy coin. Mempool for that fork would be larger than legacy since Bitcoin w/ segwit is larger than Bitcoin sans segwit.
* As a result, miners would be attracted to mining BIP148 blocks as it is richer in fees.
* As a result, BIP148 coin would start to increase in value from 0 to at least Legacy coin value rather quickly.
* The cycle would escalate as users fearing their transaction being re-orged to oblivion raise fees, and more logical miners would be attracted to the BIP148 chain to mine richer blocks.
* End result, chain gets re-organized on top of BIP148 coin which becomes Bitcoin, segwit activated.
**What's wrong with above logic**
People. They often work against their own self interest.

Here's an very VERY easy way to protect your Bitcoin from Quantum computers:
Simply move your funds to a multisig address (say 3 out of 3) - now the chance of brute-forcing a private key(s) just got quantrillions times harder.
Problem solved, no need to change PoW - ingredients already built into protocol.
@_date: 2017-06-22 14:20:56
Regarding the statement that Bitcoin+SW is worth more than Bitcoin without it: well, for legacy users, it is equal (SW is a soft fork); For SW users it's a plus (lower fees per byte); for future development its a plus (better services, less malleability, schnorr, LN); So we're left with miners where its arguably a minus? Not sure, but the economical majority is definitely on the SW side so the argument Bitcoin +SW &gt;= Bitcoin is definitely reasonable.
Why would miners follow big blocks? Because a logical miner would mine a block that has: 
* Potentially more transactions (=more fees).
* Potentially more demand (because of rarity and need of users that NEED to transact and do not want to risk re-org).
Regarding your last point, BIP148 blocks would NOT be orphaned because they are completely backwards compatible with legacy blocks. Legacy blocks will be invalidated on the BIP148 chain, but BIP 148 blocks would be accepted on the legacy chain.
Segwit won't be activated on August 1st - agree with you there. Split will begin August 1st, and if logic prevails, snowballing will commence then towards 148. On the 148 chain SW will be 100% supported, of course, and 2016 blocks later (that could take longer than usual) - would lock.

Why would it lack miners given the axiom that miners are logical and selfish? The auction example I gave is relevant here? Why would you bid $10 if you know your opponent would rush and close the auction at $99?


I'm not sure any of us know what many miners believe, but give them credit that they are as smart as you, know the rules, understand the risks - why would they want to mine on a 're-orgable' chain while their opponents mine on a non-reorgable chain? 
I think they're smart as we are, and my take on segwit2x which will be activated **before** August 1st (no surprise there!) and is supported by 80% of the miners is exactly the smart, logical response - they want to activate SW to prevent a split that will cost them dearly.


I think that again you're discredit miners - they are as smart as us, and if I am able to install an update client in less than 2 minutes, so do they.
My bottom line would be that as we approach August 1st, more chatter will be around UASF and come July 21st, segwit2x activates so that near the end of that month, saving-faced miners have activated segwit and BIP148 will never kick off a chain split.
And in that I totally agree with your last point.
@_date: 2017-06-22 17:09:14
Can you reference why you think legacy nodes would discard BIP148 blocks? That is factually incorrect. UASF is a soft fork, not a hard fork.  Legacy nodes would therefore validate BIP148 blocks.
@_date: 2017-06-23 08:41:34


EXACTLY. UASF made it so. 
Setting an activation date (as opposed to BIP141 95% miner vote) is BIP148 single most important contribution. 
I argue that had UASF chose a later date, say Sept 1st, Segwit2x would activate Aug 21st. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 17:53:27
You gave a correct description of a chain split. Totally agree there. Fast forward a bit, given some hashrate, eventually 148 coin gets segwit activated as 100% of blocks on its side of the fork support SW. 
Given game theory (see my reply above) - it is logical to assume that Bitcoin+SW would be more attractive to the economic majority then Bitcoin sans SW and thus that side of the fork would gain traction.
If we assume EVERYONE is logical, than they would support it from the start.
Let me explain that game theory with an example: 
Suppose we auction a regular, nothing special $100 bill. Alice and Bob bid for it, with regular auction rules: highest bidder wins, and if two bidders bid same amount - first bidder to bid wins.
* Auction starts: Alice bids say $10 hoping for a 10x return.
* Bob bids $50, hoping for a 2x return.
* On and on it goes until Alice bids at $99 hoping for a ~1% return. 
* That's the dumb responses, because they are slow. Game theory: if everyone is logical and everyone knows the rules, the correct response in that auction would be of course to rush first with a $99 bid - assuring a 1% profit. Any other response is a loser by design.
Going back to bitcoin: if everyone knows the rules, then the correct response of every logical miner come August 1st would be to rush to mine 148 coin because that's the only assured side of the fork that would not risk a re-org, as long as there is any hash rate on that fork.
Am I missing anything here? I don't think so, except a sabotage-intent miner who would mine in secret for 99 blocks on 148 and then publish in order to re-org the past 100 blocks.
