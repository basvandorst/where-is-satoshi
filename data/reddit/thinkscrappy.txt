Thank you so much Michael.  This was a comforting message and I was able to see it but not respond from my phone while traveling.

Thanks for this.  I was locked out actually so I could not see that and no evidence of the transfer on the blockchain.  They must have to manually approve the account closure and that was why there was a delay.  I thought it could have been an error or a compliance issue and got worried.

Issue resolved!  Thank you everyone.

UPDATE: to be clear, I did follow the instructions and placed the address of where the bitcoins should be transferred as requested.  Then the account was closed and the money was not sent and support them stopped supporting.
I did receive the money just last night.
Thank you for all the advice and I apologize for having been aggressive in trying to get support from Coinbase on clarity.  The combination of my account being banned and then not seeing the transfer on the blockchain got me very worried.
To one commenters point, the reason why I was unable to respond earlier to this thread happens to be because of travel.

Thank you for everyone help! I did receive the coins and sorry for delay in not responding earlier to this thread as I was traveling. And it's the weekend :)
Joking aside, my frustration was a combination of the account being closed for no reason (IMHO), no sign of transfer on blockchain after submitting address to Coonbase, short answer from Coonbase with no update, asking to move all the money in one transaction, and having been such a huge fan of Coinbae and what they have done to push Bitcoin forward.
Bitcoin is still an experiment and I understand Coinbase is not acting maliciously but trying to follow the laws and run a big exchange / bank.

It is banking compliance that go my account locked out.  I was unable to respond from my phone on this thread for some reason while traveling, so sorry for delay.

Did not mean to be misleading.  You are right.  Thank you for escalating my request and for resolving the transfer.  
I hope you can understand users frustration and worry when they are asked to send one address to send 100% of their bitcoins.  Then no indication of transfer on blockchain, locked out of account, and support stops their support.
Best of luck with Coinbase.  It is a company that can do great good for Bitcoin.  Its a shame that I am locked out.

Jokes are meant to be funny? Don't see anything funny about his post? What parts of his column/ research are supposed to be discussed seriously and what parts are a joke? I guess we will find out based on how the public takes to his flippant logic.

same thing with stocks... stock splits open up investment from retail investors ... i think it will come naturally though when BTC eCommerce develops.. merchants will price their products as attractively as possible - the 99 cents store will not be .001 BTC store :)

I agree with you in theory, but the problem is that if a merchant accepts one of these stolen bitcoiins, then HE might have a hard time converting it into CASH, because the exchange knows which coins were originally stolen, but the exchange does not know if he (the merchant) is the thief

thank you for this reply... i have looked into Anoncoin as a possible solution to this problem, but I am not convinced they have solved either...
@_date: 2013-12-04 19:04:29
I have done a search for chargebacks etc., haven't seen a thread with a solution?

They are going to love it. Report back!
