it's on life support right now with this slow descent. whales be cushioning
@_date: 2017-03-22 04:30:38
because big money is using this opportunity to deleverage and wait until the fork is done
@_date: 2017-03-18 11:58:09
Mind blown

What other pools are planning on signaling BU?
@_date: 2017-03-15 23:55:51
you guys think there will be a dump if this proves to be real?
@_date: 2017-03-17 18:31:34
HF imminent? people picking sides now
@_date: 2017-03-17 18:42:02
if BU loses and quits, they'll dump their coins. the price will crash before a fork occurs. or they'll fork and dump their coins on the core chain and crash the price, while they try and hold up their own price

rumor going around that chinese exchanges are goxxing. real reason why they can't allow bitcoin withdrawals
@_date: 2017-03-17 21:14:23
short term pain? btc will be set back at least another 3 years
@_date: 2017-03-13 08:38:53
What is antpools hash rate and what is the current signaling rate for BU? Does it look probable?
@_date: 2017-03-16 12:14:14
i think it lends more credence to the rumor that has been going around about the goxxing of chinese exchanges as the real reason why withdrawals were canceled. it was found during the inspections and they used regulation as an excuse to stop withdrawas so they could recoup their bitcoin supply.
@_date: 2017-03-15 23:32:07
maybe they didn't allow btc withdrawals is because they don't have the btc? that would make sense
@_date: 2017-03-16 00:02:44
i could see that explaining the lack of a dump after the ETF if the exchanges were trying to hold up the price. even the price action right now is suspicious
@_date: 2017-03-16 00:10:57
we're sitting on a powder keg right now. anything negative, if true, will send us in a downward spiral. especially if there's another mt gox with multiple exchanges involved.

Is the block size debate over?
@_date: 2017-03-24 18:39:25
in terms of game-theory, how likely would it be that people dump their coins on the new chain? people will act in their self-interests instead of being idealistic. They'll grab up all those cheap BTU coins and move onto the majority hashrate chain.
@_date: 2016-11-07 23:41:09
is something brewing? isn't this pretty big news?
@_date: 2017-04-28 15:48:14
Nice shilling. So what's your bfx salary?
@_date: 2017-04-22 15:18:52
funny reason to buy ltc because you will turn into a bagholder. there is no use of segwit or lightning network on ltc. the amount of people that use LN on the testnet is greater than people that use ltc for any transactions at all.
@_date: 2017-04-24 23:02:55
testing things that require usage on an alt coin that isn't used at all means you're not actually getting any meaningful results. how can 10 transactions a block simulate the number of transactions of bitcoin
@_date: 2017-04-27 23:31:20
a rollback would be impractical. so after a fork you want another one one, so you then have to decide on the forked chain to use and then fork again? why wouldn't you just use the one that didn't fuck up? your proposal isn't rational
@_date: 2017-04-21 00:52:12
do you have any proof of solvency?
@_date: 2017-04-22 15:15:26
except nobody in the real world actually uses ltc lol. it's just a pump and dump
@_date: 2017-04-28 14:17:01
So "liability" coverage is sufficient because they don't actually have to cover tether. What a scam.
@_date: 2017-05-08 21:25:58
that's one hell of a fee
@_date: 2017-05-14 03:09:31
is segwit required for RSK&gt;
@_date: 2017-05-22 03:11:28
where in his response did he state that segwit was getting activated? he didn't confirm anything. OP has a language disability. Plus, there would've been a price movement from insider buying before this was posted
@_date: 2017-05-13 23:49:13
is this such a good idea? if it fails for any other reason, that will be an excuse to kill segwit
@_date: 2017-05-15 02:53:02
what are the advantages and disadvantages of using a federated side chain?
@_date: 2017-05-07 18:31:39
twitter polls..really? if segwit gets the majority vote they can just say that not many people voted.
@_date: 2017-05-12 04:23:53
some say bubble, others are screaming moon
