Yeah, you lost me there man. I highly doubt people say that. What's their reasoning behind that??

Wow, thanks for all that info. I appreciate it.

No offence, just trying to get the logic down.

His comment on the 'not finite' may not be correct. But i'm not too sure in his meaning. 
Regarding the new companies newly accepting Bitcoin, I think like most adoption processes, there will be a critical point that ignites exponential growth at some point. Whether this be the acceptance by a large consumer goods co such as Walmart or Amazon. Or by some substantial external factor such the rates of competing currencies.

Ok that seems to make economical sense. But I'm if this part of your statement is correct "Next year BC will be $138, year after $53. There will be bumps of course, but generally the value will slowly but steadily decline." Assuming that circulation is increased through the openings of future marketplaces such as walmart,etc, wouldn't you expect the rice to go up over time?

On a tangential question, how does a global currency such as BitCoin affect exchange rates in the long term? If it even does..
