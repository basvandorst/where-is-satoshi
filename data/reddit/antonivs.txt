The main argument is that he claims to be Satoshi. 
However, he's consistently refused to perform a simple step that would most conclusively prove it: either signing a message with any of the keys that can plausibly be associated with Satoshi, or moving some coins associated with Satoshi.
This is something that could be done and posted on the Internet for anyone to verify. The simplest explanation for his refusal to do this is that he is not Satoshi.
The main reason anyone ever took seriously the idea that he might be Satoshi was that he gave a controlled, private demonstration of the necessary signing operation to various Bitcoin luminaries such as Gavin Andresen, which seems to have convinced them, at least temporarily. 
However, the public information about this demo is highly suspect - for example, Wright's assistant apparently left to buy a new laptop for the demo, supposedly to prove lack of any rigging, but actually providing an opportunity for exactly that. The demo audience was apparently not allowed to personally verify anything, or take copies of the results, which is a red flag in itself. Andresen later stated that he assumed Wright would be posting public proof after the demo. Wright at one point said he was going to publish the proof, but then a couple of days later replaced his website with a [public refusal to do so](
All the signs point to Wright being a con artist, engaging in a scheme that's probably related to his numerous legal problems in Australia.

@_date: 2016-08-05 18:32:43
The standard way to do that kind of thing is to pro-rate the loss: add up all the remaining BTC, divide that by the original total to get a percentage, and give each customer that percentage of their original balance.
So if 80% of the total BTC were stolen, each customer would get 20% of their BTC back. A customer with 1 million BTC would receive 200,000 BTC back.

The points you make in your comment don't follow in any way from the Bitfinex hack.


The Bitfinex hack was not such a scenario. It was a case of an exchange attempting to work around financial regulations by exploiting technologies with a *much* shorter real-world track record than Bitcoin, namely multisig transactions, and relying on a third party company as a key part of their security model.
It's easy to set up a secure Bitcoin bank. You just avoid doing anything like the above, and implement the same kinds of controls that traditional banks do.  Exploring the cutting edge and being a secure bank are conflicting goals - the security of customer deposits should not depend on cutting-edge technologies that have not been battle-tested in real world scenarios.


Bitfinex was not a "Bitcoin bank", and it didn't conduct itself as though it was. It was an exchange attempting to circumvent regulations even after court rulings specifically about their situation. To circumvent those rulings, it grasped at a technology that it thought was a clever way around the regulations. If it had not done that, customers would still have their money.
If one holds the ideological position that the regulations that Bitfinex was circumventing are unnecessary, then you're subject to the risks of dealing with a company that doesn't follow those regulations. If anything, Bitfinex is an example of what inevitably happens in such cases. A real bank, following banking regulations, is significantly less prone to such problems.
@_date: 2016-08-21 02:51:17


Many people will think that, certainly, but it's not *Bitcoin* that's immature, but rather many of the businesses in the Bitcoin ecosystem.
The problem is that people in the Bitcoin industry are prone to getting carried away with technology, using cutting edge technology to attempt to secure and manage people's money. This is generally a bad idea. The reason that traditional banks are very conservative is that no-one wants to hear that they lost their money because the banks installed some new barely-tested security or money management system.


This is misguided. The Bitcoin protocol has proven perfectly safe so far. The problem is when people send their Bitcoin to someone else to manage, and when the people managing it offer systems to the public that aren't secure.
Attempting to solve this at the level of the Bitcoin protocol is dangerous - you're mixing different concerns, and are more likely to break something that fix anything. No matter what the Bitcoin protocol offers, if it provides a way for person A to pay person B digitally, hackers are going to be able to break into insecure systems and initiate transactions.
Consider traditional online banking. I can log into my bank account online right now and wire $20,000 to anyone in the world with a bank account. If hackers could break in, they could do the same. Why isn't this an endemic problem for banks? The main answer is because banks have mature security systems. It has nothing to do with the "dollar protocol" or whatever.

My point is, most people with large amounts of money on an exchange are doing (1), except that they're trading actively which implies leaving significant amounts on the exchange at any given time.
There's no reason for anyone to do (2), and it seems unlikely that many people use exchanges as glorified web wallets, since the exchanges (other than special cases like Coinbase) don't even market themselves for that purpose. 
Someone who has a lot of Bitcoin and isn't trading, but is naive, would be more likely to have their money in a web wallet service - which is just as dangerous, but the point is that most people with significant money on an exchange are actually trading, so there's a good reason for their behavior.

You have that backwards. Most products get their value from supply and demand. Not everything that gets value from supply and demand is fiat. It just so happens that fiat, and Bitcoin, both derive their specific value from supply and demand.
Regarding your theory that Bitcoin is a commodity because work goes into mining it, 
the main problem with that is still that it has no intrinsic value - people have no use for Bitcoin other than as a representation of other wealth, i.e. a currency-like usage. 
With commodities, the commodity itself has value to its users independent of the work that went into producing it.

A typical definition of commodity is "a raw material or primary agricultural product that can be bought and sold, such as copper or coffee."
Bitcoin is not a commodity in that sense. Its value comes from being used as a representation of wealth, like a currency, not from any value that it intrinsically possesses, like a commodity.

It depends on the open source license that's used. Some licenses, like MIT and BSD, allow you to do pretty much anything you want with the code, including sell it.
They only require that you include the original copyright notice (which tells you who owns the copyright) and license text. So taking the code of a BSD or MIT license app, building it, and selling the app is fine as long as the app includes the copyright notice.
Other licenses, like GPL, require that you make the source code available to any users of the application - and if you modify the code, that you make the source to those modifications available under the terms of the GPL license. Even in that case, you can legally take the source of a GPL app, build it, and sell it, as long as you make the source code available.
The catch for a would-be "thief" in both these situations is that, if you include the info about where the source code came from, or provide the source code, you significantly reduce the ability to profit from selling it unmodified. So "theft" in this case involves hiding the origin of the code, thus violating the license and potentially making more money from people who don't realize that they can get the same thing for free elsewhere.
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:34:48


As long as you abide by the terms of the license in question, it means both of those things. In fact the [Open Source definition]( explicitly requires it:


You can copy and sell someone else's open source software, *and* someone else can give it away for free, and the licenses require that both of those cases be allowed.
One of the main barriers to becoming rich selling other people's open source is that you're competing with free sources of the same program. That's why people will often hide the origins of the source code, at which point they're in violation of the license.

Perhaps you're confusing me with another commenter. I didn't say Bitcoin is fiat, I said Bitcoin is not a commodity.


I asked about the definition of commodity that you're using.


If you would actually look up a definition for a change, you'd find out how this is wrong. The same thing that gives Bitcoin value gives fiat currency value: "[The value of fiat money is derived from the relationship between supply and demand rather than the value of the material that the money is made of](

There's another sense of "commodity" which refers to financial instruments of all kinds, e.g. "currency or stock and bond indexes." However, in that sense, fiat currencies are also commodities. You can't really have it both ways, where fiat currencies are not a commodity and Bitcoin is.

Don't feel bad, there's a lot of confusion and misinformation about open source and free software. It's a surprisingly subtle topic that even confuses experienced lawyers at software companies - I've dealt with some of them.
It's worth reading the text of the [MIT License]( (really short!) and the [BSD License]( (also short) to see what the simplest open source licenses say.
The [Apache license]( is a bit longer, but still easy to get the gist of on a brief skim. It's similar to the above two in intent, but it adds some features like saying what happens legally if you optionally choose to contribute changes back to the license owner.
If the above were the only kind of open source license, the topic would be much simpler. But licenses like the GPL complicate things by being more ambitious, particularly in regards to the requirement to make the source of your own changes to GPL software freely available. Because of this, the license is longer and more complicated, particularly in v3 which addressed software services provided via networks. Since the license puts more restrictions on users, a larger license is required to define those restrictions and their implications.
@_date: 2018-01-01 03:01:03
A commodity in the relevant sense is "a raw material or primary agricultural product that can be bought and sold, such as copper or coffee."

It's pretty much the opposite. Supply and demand determine the value of fiat currencies. Governments just adjust their monetary policies, like issuing more currency (supply) to react to changes in the demand for currency.
For example, if a government prints a huge amount of new currency for no good reason, the currency becomes worth less and prices of goods and services go up, i.e. inflation. That's supply and demand in action.

It's extremely unlikely that you'd get a valid address that way, and the wallet would just tell you there was a problem. Realistically, you can cross this off your list of worries.
I agree with all the rest though. In particular, this is a huge problem:


...and a lot of companies right now are taking advantage of this, to rip people off with conversion rates, fees and so on. Those Bitcoin ATMs end up charging at least about 8% on their transactions, and Bitcoin debit cards are worse.

Someone could send money direct to an exchange and start trading, without ever having their own wallet or control over any addresses. Just because they don't have a blockchain address doesn't mean it's not true.
Also, someone could search the blockchain for a transaction that they can tell a story about, so having a hash doesn't prove anything unless they also prove that they have control over the address.

Right. It's not a solution, it's just making different tradeoffs for a short term benefit. I'm not arguing either side, just pointing out that the fundamental limits aren't addressed by this kind of fix. That also makes it much more difficult to get consensus about a fix.


Try not to impose your prejudices on me.


It absolutely is. As you pointed out yourself, it's a short term fix and involves tradeoffs.


I'm not saying it's a bad idea, I'm saying it doesn't in any way address the fundamental limits created by a proof of work algorithm running on an unshardable network. It's playing with parameters, trading off properties against each other. 


I said no *formal* governance. To the extent that Blockstream has control, it's de facto, and besides there's no accountability to stakeholders which one would typically expect with more formal governance.
That's another fundamental limitation on Bitcoin - the governance model is a bad ancap joke, and the community has been discovering that first hand for a while now.

But that's exactly the problem. If I have $1000 in a bank account, and someone adds 100 million times more dollars into the economy, the price of everything in dollars would go up dramatically, and the money in my bank account would become effectively worthless. That's called inflation.
If the money supply is not restricted, inflation will cause the value of a currency to tend towards zero. Even in the real world cases of hyperinflation, the money supply is still restricted, it's just not restricted enough. If it's not restricted at all, a currency cannot work.
So a limited supply is actually critical to the functioning of a currency.

I don't think resource scarcity is likely to be a big issue. The resources that someone living on UBI alone would be able to afford should be the basics: food, clothing, shelter. Those people would be spending almost all of their allotment every month, so the money would immediately cycle back into the economy.
Any developed nation considering a UBI almost certainly already has enough food to feed its entire population - the reason people go hungry has to do with inequality, not lack of food. UBI could be part of an economically-driven mechanism to distribute that food more effectively, since the people who need food would now have money to pay for it, which would incentivize others to distribute it to them.
Similar logic applies to clothing and shelter - there would be a market for cheap clothing and housing for people living solely on UBI. It would presumably be low quality and not terribly desirable, but it's better than being homeless or starving, or having to depend on inconsistent charity options.
It would certainly result in adjustments to the economy, which are impossible to fully predict. One obvious scenario is that prices could rise due to increased demand, requiring UBI to be increased, leading to an inflationary spiral ending in hyperinflation. 
If there's no equilibrium point in such a scenario, it implies that as you suggest, the available resources simply can't satisfy the demand. But a UBI pilot program could monitor that closely and adjust to avoid runaway inflation, canceling or scaling back the program if necessary.

For a currency, rarity is in fact important. The reason is that once people are using it, it has value agreed on by the market. If you can print more money effortlessly, you create value without providing corresponding value in exchange, and the value of everyone else's money drops. If anyone can do that, the value of the currency is completely undermined and it becomes useless as a currency.
Slicing the currency up into smaller pieces doesn't have this effect, since that doesn't change the value of the currency. 
Note that I'm not saying that "limited supply" is a sufficient justification for value on its own. It's a necessary, but not sufficient, criterion.
As an aside, in its current form, a Bitcoin can be sliced into 100 million pieces (satoshis) maximum, so the entire Bitcoin capitalization can't exceed 2100 trillion satoshis.  If Bitcoin were the only currency in the world, then each satoshi would be worth somewhere around a few US cents (based on the gross world product of ~$100 trillion.)

They're not identical because for traditional currency, it's not the currency that behaves that way, it depends on what you do with it. 
You used the example of an IRA - that's a legal structure with restrictions, etc. You don't get the benefit of an IRA just by hodling dollars. Putting your dollars in an IRA means you're no longer just hodling, they're being invested, typically by someone who controls those dollars on your behalf.
If you're just hodling dollars, there's no incentive to keep them unspent or uninvested. In fact, inflation creates a disincentive to do that. If you're not going to spend it, then the decision making favors investing in something that generates value, possibly loan it out, etc. If you give it to an investment manager, they'll do that stuff for you.
From the investor's perspective, you could ignore some of these distinctions and treat investing inflationary fiat as being similar to holding Bitcoin in terms of potential asset growth. But that's part of the problem: if the individual decision making favors just hodling currency, that's bad for the economy: you're not spending, and not investing. Aside from the bad effects of that, this hoarding of the currency drives its value up without a corresponding increase in the underlying economy, leading to a currency bubble.

Part of the problem is that the effects on the network can't be fully predicted, such as the effect on the number of full nodes, etc. Addressing the issue essentially requires experimenting on the Bitcoin community, and as I've already alluded to, some people are naturally conservative about that.
These kinds of factors are what I was getting at when I wrote that because the available solutions don't address the fundamental limitations, it "makes it much more difficult to get consensus about a fix." It's not just a binary question of increasing the block size or not - it's a question of which direction to go in a much larger possibility space.
If you step back and look at it dispassionately, it could make a lot of sense to force a more comprehensive solution now than postpone scaling problems to when adoption is even more widespread and major changes will be even more difficult.
In situations like this, it's pretty common for uncoordinated groups of people to wait until the problems are so bad that a contentious fix is better than the status quo even for the people who were originally against it. 
That happens, as I've pointed out, because of a lack of true solutions to the problem, the fact that changes need to be made to a large, actively used network, and the lack of formal governance.

The short answer is no. See e.g. [Why is Deflation Bad for the Economy?]( 
Aside from the way deflation inhibits spending, it also has other effects, like inhibiting loans - it either doesn't make sense to lend money, or if you do, the borrower has to pay a lot. This has a strong inhibiting effect on an economy.
Inflation often gets a bad rap, but if the underlying economy is growing, then it's natural for the supply of currency used to buy and sell things in that economy to grow also. One of the functions central banks perform is to try to adjust the growth of the currency in ways that support the growth of the economy.

 "Wall" is just a way of describing a certain pattern of orders (bids and asks). When there are a lot of orders at or near a particular price, it's called a wall.
Price is determined by individual trades, but walls obviously affect how quickly the price can change, i.e. it takes longer for the price to move past a wall than if the wall wasn't there.

Evidence would be needed for these claims.
The claim of UBI proponents is that it's the opposite - removing the wage slavery requirement frees people up to work on things that increase innovation, allow people to find ways to create economic value that they might not have had the freedom to do otherwise, which increases job growth, etc.
Think of it as providing everyone with seed funding. Not everyone will take maximum advantage of it, and many will fail, but for the overall economy the successes should outweigh the failures. It's the same logic behind the venture capital market.
The fact that it provides a way to address poverty at the same time can be seen as a bonus side effect, for those coming at it from a perspective of being concerned about the overall economy. From this perspective, the main point is to remove a major barrier to realizing human potential.

The growth in value in that case isn't due to appreciation of the currency, it's due to the interest based on investing that money in something other than the currency itself. 
The equivalent for the dollar would be if you kept it under your mattress for a few years, and then found at the end of that time, you could buy much more with it. Generally speaking, it doesn't work like that. If it did, people would tend to hoard dollars, spend less, avoid loaning money, etc., which has a negative impact on the economy.


"At some point", yes. However, there's plenty of economic study of how the incentives and disincentives play out in these cases, and the general consensus is that deflationary currencies are not a good thing. See e.g. [Why is Deflation Bad for the Economy?](

But they're problems fundamental to the technology - e.g., proof of work combined with inability to shard the network - so it's not like you can just throw a team of developers at it and say "fix this!", the way you would for a typical application. 
Every single solution that's been proposed so far is basically a workaround to the fundamental limits of the Bitcoin blockchain, not a solution to those limits. Basically, the developers all accept that those limits aren't going to be lifted any time soon, and that workarounds are the only option.
Plus, making significant changes to Bitcoin itself is hugely problematic because it's so heavily used and has no formal governance. It's similar to the reason that most of the US last mile broadband infrastructure is so slow compared to many other countries - because it was one of the first movers, it's hard to change now.
Another thing that's been predicted for years is that Bitcoin won't be the final cryptocurrency. The best solution to these problems will probably take the form of a different blockchain, but the one that's so obviously better than Bitcoin and doesn't have its own set of fundamental limitations hasn't been invented yet.

I already linked to an explanation of that. In particular, see [How could a block size increase affect user security]( But the rest of that section is relevant too. The choice doesn't "boil down to" any one single issue.
I originally responded to you because you seemed not to understand why scaling hadn't been addressed sooner. I gave you my explanation of that, but you don't seem particularly interested in that discussion or hearing about the underlying issues. 
I guess what you meant to say originally was that we know that one of the scaling problems could be temporarily addressed by a block size increase, so why wasn't that done sooner. My response addresses that question as well, but it doesn't really have as much as you might think to do with the technical pros and cons of the specific issue.

In a certain sense, that's true, but that's not the point here. The important consequence of "gold has intrinsic value" is that there are factors that drive demand for gold other than its use as a "store of value." 
If the *only* purpose of some asset is as a store of value, then you're entirely reliant on everyone agreeing that it's a store of value - i.e. people value it only because people agree to value it. Without some external source of demand, that's extremely fragile and is virtually the definition of a bubble. All it takes is one good scare and such a bubble will pop for good.


...except for all the other cryptocurrencies with similar or better properties. And that's the killer threat to Bitcoin as a pure store of value. It cannot survive long term if that's its only purpose, because other cryptocurrencies will eventually take over as mediums of exchange and units of account, and those currencies will then make more sense as a store of value.

(Edit:) Most exchanges are centralized, i.e. trades happen off the blockchain. So actual trades don't account for those transactions.
However, a lot of the transactions are likely to be people depositing and withdrawing money from exchanges because of the boom in trading activity. There's no evidence of Bitcoin adoption as a currency increasing dramatically recently - if anything, it's been falling off due to some of the problems.


Because most exchange trades happen off the blockchain, the only effect that Bitcoin transaction speed has on the BTC price is indirect.
If people are having trouble getting their money on and off exchanges, that's going to have an effect on prices. Interestingly, when the Bitfinex exchange recently was having trouble with deposits and withdrawals, its Bitcoin price ended up getting over $1000 higher than some other exchanges, but came back down again once the problems were (somewhat) mitigated.


In theory, it's possible to "cancel" unconfirmed transactions, by reissuing the transaction with a higher fee (to make it more likely to be picked up by miners) and sending the money back to yourself. In practice, there can be challenges with this. Wallet software often doesn't support it, you may not control the transaction (if your money is on an exchange), etc.


(Edit:) The trade itself is unaffected because (most) exchanges are centralized and not on the blockchain. There's no notion of "price" on the blockchain - 1 BTC is always worth 1 BTC.

You keep repeating this, I'm going to keep replying because it's such a terribly wrong statement.
Bitcoin is not your local currency.  You're experiencing a problem because you want to convert all your Bitcoin receipts to your local currency immediately on receipt.  This exposes you to exchange rate risk if you want to process returns in the original currency.
If you held your Bitcoin income, say for at least the amount of time that returns are allowed, you would have no problem returning Bitcoin to customers.  The reason you don't want to do that is because your company management doesn't want to expose itself to exchange rate risk on their cash on hand.
Again, this has nothing to do with Bitcoin not being a currency.  It has to do with your company not wanting to expose either itself or its customers to currency risk.  In the absence of good hedging vehicles, you can't have it both ways.  Luckily, there's an easy solution: process returns in your local currency.  Everyone will understand that, and you'll still be helping move Bitcoin forward.

I suppose the argument would be that the more the Bitcoin ecosystem grows without attention from regulators, the harder it will be to stop it when they do get around to regulating it.
But realistically, that cat exited the bag some time ago.  National and local governments around the world are aware of Bitcoin, and because of its potential impact on existing systems, they're going to take action one way or another.  Having a voice in that discussion does seem preferable to not having one.
The tinfoil hatters here in tend to see people like Lawsky as cartoon villains, but the reality is that one of his goals is actually to encourage businesses to enter a potentially profitable new business area, by giving clear rules that allow them to do business with the confidence that they're won't be shut down for violating laws relating to financial products.  
Anyone in the financial industry in NY is keenly aware of how important that industry is to the state's economic health.  Being left out of the next wave of financial innovation is not an option.  It's not just about clamping down on this strange new thing, it's figuring out how to fit it in.

Well, exactly.  Can I rest my case about competence now?  Who says "hey, let's develop a system to keep track of people's money and, I know! We'll use MySQL as the database!"?


Oh come on, what sort of systems are you talking about?  If your database is critical, you typically have things like  replicas, nightly image backups, application-level transaction logs, etc. and you should be able to recover from a database loss in pretty short order - hours, not days.
You previously mentioned the big AWS outages.  I was directly affected by one of those, because a client of mine had their primary systems in the AWS US-East region, in the most affected availability zone (us-east-1d, I think it was.)  Their cross-zone failover didn't work because of the severity of the outage.  We switched to standby systems in another region and were up and running again in under two hours - and much of that time was deciding whether the problem was severe enough to warrant the switch.


I can't think of a single such service involving user financial data that has been down for this kind of timeframe, continuously.  Can you?

Technological change takes time.  The internet originally came together around 1981, and the first commercial service providers appeared around 1990.  But it wasn't until the mid to late 90s that it started taking off at a consumer level, and even then it had another 10 years to go before it was truly mainstream.   So that's an uptake time of nearly 30 years.  During that time, things change and improve to make it easier and more useful for consumers.

There's an interesting contradiction inherent in that sentence.  To be a "member of society" implies some degree of willingness to abide by the laws of that society.  One reason for that is fairness - it's actually pretty easy for smart people to break laws and profit from doing so, but it's unfair to those that choose to abide by the laws.  Those law-abiding people are the victims in this case; profiting from law-breaking is not a victimless crime.
The fact that some of the laws in question are bad laws is not really the issue here.  If Shrem's actions were somehow morally or altruistically motivated, his actions could be more easily defended.  As it is, his motivation, based on his own statements as quoted in the criminal complaint, seem to have been simple greed - he broke the law so he could make more money.  That was a choice he made, and it was the wrong one.
It was not smart for him, and it was not smart for the Bitcoin community, either.  He had an opportunity, and funding, to pursue a legitimate business in the Bitcoin space.  He could have just said no to BTCKing and followed the law, continued to develop BitInstant, and figured out a way to make it a thriving part of the future of Bitcoin.  His actions in this case were not those of someone acting as a smart, hard-working, innovative member of society.
In the end, I hope *he* recognizes that, takes a plea deal, and learns from his mistake.

Right.  What that tells us is that some systems can be hacked, not that "everything can be hacked."  The systems that can be hacked are the ones that have not been properly secured.  Hackers attack companies in the same way that lions attack a herd of antelope: the weakest animals are the ones that are targeted and taken.
When you examine the nature of these attacks, they invariably take advantage of security weaknesses that are known issues, that proper security procedures would have prevented, and that security audits would have identified.
To clarify, though, I'm talking about remote attacks.  If you infiltrate a company in person the way someone like Ed Snowden did, it's much more difficult to protect against that, because in that case the person has legitimate access to systems and can often exploit that.  In a remote attack, where all you have is the ability to connect to a company's servers across a network, it is perfectly possible and common for systems to be unhackable.
The one exception to that would be the very rare instances like the recent Heartbleed bug, where a security hole in otherwise reliable infrastructure is discovered that cannot be fully protected against ahead of time.  That's why that case was such big news.  But even in such cases, a properly layered security architecture ("defense in depth") should prevent hackers from being able to reach core systems, limiting the scope of any breach.

Actually, a lot depends on the choice of product.  MySQL is not the system you want to be using when you need to restore a database and do a point in time recovery.  I know one company that decided to drop MySQL the first time they actually had to do that.


Oh, I see: they've been manually retyping the transactions!?  :P
A competent company with 1.4 million users should have ensured that it has efficient disaster recovery procedures.  (BTW, in attempting to check their current user count, I got an error page from CloudFlare, so it's apparently not out of the woods yet.)


Sounds horrifying.  But RBS is a candidate for least competent large bank in the Western world.  It's basically a taxpayer money sink at this point, having now eaten through the entire £46bn of tax money that was pumped in after the financial crisis.  Their 2013 loss of £8.2 billion was the biggest since the crisis, so it's not like things are improving.  If it weren't for the whole "too big too fail" conjecture, it would have been out of business long ago.
I have a friend who's worked in software development at RBS's $500 million building in Stamford CT, which houses the second biggest trading floor in the US.  The dysfunction there is notably worse than at other big financial firms. Admittedly, that could have to do with their US operation being a bit half-hearted and having been built by unusual acquisitions of companies like Greenwich Capital and ABN Amro.  The infighting between groups who came from different acquisitions is legendary.

This isn't relevant to your original point, which made certain assumptions that have led you in a very specific direction, but not the only valid ethical direction.  You originally wrote:


But for example, an ethical system may hold that someone who violates privacy no longer has the right to privacy.  If you want to call that a privilege instead, that's fine, but it's not relevant (that's a definitional issue that depends on which school of thought you're thinking of, e.g. privilege in Hohlfeld's analysis means something different.)  
The point is that a perfectly good ethical system can take the position that privacy is not an absolute right, so you cannot say "if you were an ethical person you should..."  Your position assumes a particular class of ethical systems, those in which privacy is an absolute right that cannot be abrogated.

If they were no longer used as currency, you wouldn't buy them from someone else to use for those purposes.  Their value is *effectively* zero, except in some rather unlikely scenarios.


All of those things require us to associate some abstraction, like ownership or a contractual agreement, with some instances of Bitcoin.  In doing that, we're assigning a value to those Bitcoin instances that is not its intrinsic value.  *Intrinsic* value, in the context of currency, refers to the value that remains when that association to something of value is broken.  See e.g. [Types of Money]( for an explanation of the term.
Bitcoin does not have intrinsic value in this sense, even though the Bitcoin protocol is valuable in the senses you describe.


I assume you meant "subjective".  Either way, that's not correct, because "intrinsic value" is a term with an accepted definition in the context of currency, and I used it in the sense of that definition.

I've never seen a definition of "bug" that requires it to be unknown.  A bug is an error in behavior, whether known or unknown, that causes an unintended or undesired result.


That doesn't stop it being called a bug, as long as the program continues to produce the undesired result.


Yes, especially the ones that are also called "bugs".


What you seem to be getting at here is the case where some undesired behavior is known at the time that the system was designed.  In that case, the behavior was intended to be in the program, even though it was not desirable behavior.  
One can then say that it's not a bug in the program, since the program implements the design, and has the behavior intended by the design.  However, this distinction is primarily relevant to developers rather than users: from the user's perspective, the distinction between design and program is largely irrelevant, since the program has undesired behavior, which is referred to as a bug.  From the programmer's perspective, the design has a bug.


The ones who anticipated worked around the bug in the Bitcoin design, by implementing fixes in their wallet implementations.  That doesn't somehow make it not a bug.  It still exists, and it's still a bug.

To trade regularly on an exchange, you have to let the exchange hold your funds on your behalf.  This is essential for the proper functioning of an exchange.  The exchange acts as an escrow service, so that you don't have to deal with individual traders and trust that they will pay their side of the deal, you just have to trust that the exchange has the money and will pay it to you when you request it - which is why the MtGox situation is such a problem.
This also allows you to buy and sell instantly, without waiting for transfers to occur from your own wallet or bank account.
The problem with MtGox was first that many fiat withdrawals were taking a long time to execute.  That was not a complete showstopper as long as people could withdraw their funds as BTC.  But now, many Bitcoin withdrawals are also failing.  This means that going to another exchange may not be possible for people who already have their money at MtGox.
I don't think it will ultimately be a big deal for Bitcoin - MtGox either needs to fix its problems, or shut down.  But it's a big deal for the people who have money there right now, and the OP has a point - having a MtGox guy on the Bitcoin Foundation sends a bad message about the trustworthiness of the Bitcoin ecosystem.

"Money laundering refers to a financial transaction scheme that aims to conceal the identity, source, and destination of illicitly-obtained money." ([Cornell Law School]( 
is describing a "financial transaction scheme that aims to conceal the identity, source, and destination of ... money." Whether it's illicitly obtained has not been specified explicitly. But note that, for example, if this process is being used to avoid taxes, then that makes at least part of the money "illicitly obtained" (in the context of the  system levying the taxes.). 
Realistically, laundering is a pretty accurate term for converting one's bitcoins through an  altcoin in order to conceal its identity, source, and destination.

Cash is face to face.  Humans evolved ways of dealing with people in local interactions - one of the most basic is trusting someone until they give you a reason not to trust them.  That's the [tit for tat]( strategy, and it's very effective, both theoretically (game theory) and in practice.
But online and anonymous transactions screws up mechanisms like this, because scammers only need you to trust them once.

The point you're raising does not make sense. There are any number of good reasons to "introduce counter-party risk" as you put it, such as hedging, or trading in specific aspects of the market like volatility. The conflict you suggest between allodial title and derivatives is non-existent, because they serve entirely different purposes - holding bitcoin is not a substitute for a derivative and vice versa.
One example of using a derivative would be if you're actually holding bitcoin which you know you're going to need to convert to fiat for some upcoming transaction. You want to limit your downside risk in case the exchange rate drops before the transaction occurs, so you purchase a derivative, such as an option to sell X bitcoin at Y dollars in a month's time.  This does not necessarily involve giving up allodial title to the bitcoin you already own (although one way to establish creditworthiness for the transaction would be to do so, but it's not a  fundamental requirement.)
Alternatively, if you want to trade volatility, the whole point is not to have to own the underlying commodity in order to do that, and again the title of any bitcoin you do own is unaffected because it's not directly related to such trading.
Such transactions are actually good for the market as a whole and tend to have a stabilizing effect in general.

If you're going to be pedantic, then you should know that's not really what opportunity cost is.  Opportunity cost is used in evaluating alternative investments, so in this case it refers to the returns that Halfhand84 could have made if he had invested the same money in something else.  This can then be used to calculate what's known as "economic profit", which is the revenue from his actual investment minus the opportunity cost.  
Since not many other investments would have returned a similar ~590% return, it means that Halfhand84 made a significant positive economic profit, i.e. he has recovered his opportunity cost plus much more.

Instead of resorting to an icon, why not try to articulate the issue you think you perceive here?  You might learn something.
Regarding bad laws, we're not talking about someone who was busted for possession, or something like that.  We're talking about someone who conspired to launder over $1 million, in order to make a profit.
I'd like to hear from you why you think that's an action worth defending.  Do you see it as some sort of protest against the law?  It's pretty clear that Shrem himself didn't see it that way.
Let's imagine that in an amazing turnaround, all drug laws are repealed in the US.  Even so, money laundering laws would still exist.  The reason is that they help in prosecuting all kinds of criminal activity, from arms dealing to sale of stolen goods to violence and murder for hire.  For all we know, some of the money Shrem helped launder was used for those kinds of purposes.
Perhaps you disagree with money laundering laws too.  But in a civil society, there are various ways of addressing laws we disagree with.  Even breaking those laws is a viable option in many cases - civil disobedience has a long and honorable history.  But you can't tell me, with a straight face, that Shrem was engaging in civil disobedience here.  He was cheating for his own benefit.
So again, I'd like to hear why or how you defend his actions in this case.

You'd be right if we were talking about ordinary users of a software package.  However, that's not the case here.  He's talking specifically about businesses that are using the open source Bitcoin software as part of a business to make money from Bitcoin.  
By basing their business on open source software, those businesses choose to be part of an open source development community.  Being a member of that community, and benefiting from the work of others, the social contract associated with that is that some of their own work, whether software development, testing, or whatever, is contributed back to the project they depend on.


The idea that transaction malleability is "dodgy code" and that someone is at "fault" is dubious.  It was a known aspect of the design of the Bitcoin protocol, which was a consequence of allowing for certain kinds of extensions.  Even when it was abused by dishonest people to try to get companies to pay the same money twice, the Bitcoin system was well designed enough that transactions could be reliably sent and checked using other available data.  The real problem arose when criminals began exploiting the issue to perform denial of service attacks.
Developing good software is difficult.  Developing non-trivial software that's designed to run on the public internet and be proof against arbitrary future abuse is literally impossible, at least based on history - there has never been a software package of that kind that has not suffered from some or other weakness that can be exploited by bad people.  In this case, the weakness was known for *three years* before people began actively abusing it.
Let's try an analogy.  Imagine that a large group of thugs decided to start shooting out the windows of buildings on a regular basis.  They drive past in cars and shoot at windows.  Windows all over town are broken, businesses suspend service while they have bulletproof glass installed.  Was it "dodgy" that buildings didn't have bulletproof glass in the first place?  Was it someone's "fault"?  
In any engineering effort, software or otherwise, tradeoffs are constantly made between costs, time, and capabilities.  In the real world, things can't be engineered to be proof against every possible future attack.

The problem would have been that originally, they didn't realize what was happening. When they didn't find the transaction id they were looking for, they trusted the protocol and assumed that the transaction had never gone through. 
You're right that an investigation of a given transaction should have shown the issue easily enough - both the deduction from the source address and the credit to the target address - but they didn't think to look for transactions with different ids. (Apparently)

At some point those last holders are likely to find that no-one wants them, in which case their price would be zero.  That could easily happen if something replaces it and the miners stop mining, for example.  The value of a cryptocurrency depends on it being functional, and being used by others.
I suppose at that point, they might still have some use as a historical artifact - you could set up a little museum display with a few computers demonstrating how primitive early digital currencies were mined and exchanged.  But at that point, anyone could copy the blockchain and set up their own independent display.  In the absence of an active public Bitcoin network, there would be no way to distinguish which one was the "actual" Bitcoin, so there'd be no point in paying someone for it.

Read [this comment]( which contains a relevant quote from the press release.  Some of the key points that helped put the nails in Shrem's coffin:
* He personally bought drugs on Silk Road
* Was fully aware that Silk Road was a drug-trafficking website
* Knew that Faiella was operating a Bitcoin exchange service for Silk Road users
* Sold Bitcoin to Faiella and handled the transactions personally (i.e. cannot deny knowledge of them)
* Never filed any suspicious activity reports, despite having ample evidence of relevant activity
* Deliberately helped Faiella circumvent the Company’s AML restrictions, even though it was Shrem’s job to enforce them
So, some advice one can glean from this if you're doing business with Bitcoins:
1. Don't use Bitcoin in illegal transactions yourself.  Although in Shrem's case, the point was that his personal purchase of drugs gave him first-hand knowledge of what Silk Road was about, in general if you're doing illegal things with Bitcoin it's going to look bad if you're ever investigated, even if it's unrelated to your other business.
2. Don't do business with people that you have reason to believe are using Bitcoin for criminal purposes.
3. Comply with applicable regulations and don't help customers circumvent them.

Before I say anything, let me say I'm sorry you lost money, you don't deserve it.
But I still have a problem with this:


By 2012, there were good alternatives to MtGox as a wallet, and people were talking about why using Gox as a wallet wasn't a good idea.  Here's [a Stack Exchange post from Aug 2012](










Advice like that has been floating around for years.  Did you really never see it, or did you simply not believe it, or did you just never get around to acting on it?
A big part of the point of Bitcoin was that when you own bitcoin, you don't need to trust your ownership to someone else.  As such, using hosted wallets just makes no sense - it's almost the opposite of the point of bitcoin.  If you want to have someone else hold currency on your behalf, right now you're better off using a real bank, because they're regulated and you have some protection.  
When you gave your money to MtGox under the terms of service described above, you made a choice which you would never normally make with fiat money - i.e. to deposit it with an unregulated, uninsured, young company in a foreign country (assuming you don't live in Japan.)
Again, I'm sorry you lost money, but I can't help feeling like the people in this situation basically didn't understand or clearly think about what they were doing.  And I think it's worth discussing to prevent it from happening again.
For example, anyone with money in BTC-e right now is exposed to a huge amount of risk - anonymous owners, possibly subject to Russian law, uncertain legal and technical domicile (Bulgaria? Cyprus?), etc.  I've got nothing against BTC-e - I've used it myself - but it's just a plain fact that people with money there will have virtually no recourse if anything goes wrong.  And something might already have gone wrong, we just don't know it yet.

From his description, it sounds like they'd be doing the backup from a database replica, so what would happen is that the replicated transactions would queue up while a snapshot is taken.  After the backup, the replica would catch up with the main database.
Also, typically mechanisms like this involve taking a copy before locking anything, and then synchronizing the copy after locking, which minimizes the time that the database needs to remain locked.

Of course I have, but in the majority of cases, it's related to crimes.  All law enforcement sometimes results in innocent victims - innocent people have gone to jail, and even been put to death, so losing money or having it tied up for a while is pretty minor by comparison.
The question is really whether AML laws are somehow worse than other laws in this respect.  I don't see any evidence of that, realistically, and certainly nothing that justifies the claim that money "stops being fungible" or limits spendability for someone who's staying within the law.
The poker sites you give as examples illustrate the issue quite well - that kind of gambling is illegal in most US jurisdictions, so if someone makes the choice to use those sites, they should be aware they're taking a risk.  Whether you agree that the laws are good or not is not the issue.


You have the right to decide for yourself what's moral, but the whole point of laws is that they're what a society as a whole has agreed require enforcement.  You can think Charlie is morally innocent, but he seems to have knowingly broken some laws which are taken quite seriously.


All laws are enforced selectively.  Police decide whether to pursue an investigation, victims decide whether to press charges, prosecutors look at the specifics of a case and decide whether to prosecute, etc.  In taking the decision to break a law, you take the risk that law enforcement might decide your case is worth pursuing.
In Charlie's case, he seems to have served them the case on a silver platter, writing incriminating emails and not making much attempt to hide what he was doing.  In BitInstant's case, one of the other executives was on record telling Charlie not to take the actions he did, which supports the claim that the behavior was not company policy.  Charlie brought this on himself.
Even you are probably in favor of enforcing laws selectively.  In Charlie's case you think they shouldn't be enforced.  But I bet there are other laws that you think should be enforced even though there are other people who think they shouldn't.  
The legal way to settle disagreements like that is to work to change the law.  Most people don't get everything they want, but part of living in a society is accepting the societal consensus encoded in law.  
Of course, one way to approach trying to change laws is to deliberately break them, but in those cases you have to be prepared to accept the consequences.
I understand how you feel emotionally, but from a rational perspective, you don't seem to have a case that can be supported with an argument that's compatible with a society based on laws.

I'm not an expert, but if 1CNBBgerM3EHSQMQRsdDPSFz8vatUZoFUY is an address of yours, then that second transaction makes it look as though someone was able to spend your money (it doesn't matter that it wasn't actually yours.)  That would concern me - the obvious implication of that is some sort of security compromise.
One alternative would be that Blockchain.info is reporting the details of the double spend incorrectly or confusingly.  Have you double-checked that the address above is yours?  Perhaps the address of yours involved here is actually 1DsB1wnuMipy8d89MNfW37VLpKiQHXniH6, in which case there was an attempt to send 0.0001 BTC to that address on the 5th, with no fee.  That transaction was not confirmed, and was later overridden by the second transaction on the 6th, for 0.015 BTC.  That could be explained as a mistaken transaction, and doesn't imply any sort of breach.
If the first address definitely is yours, and you want to test whether it's been compromised, you could try sending a small amount of money to the address and see if it gets spent.  If it does, you definitely have a problem.  Of course if nothing happens, it doesn't prove much either way, except that there's no bot waiting to instantly spend your money.
The fact that the first successful payment was a double spend raises the question of whether something else is going on.  But other than the above, I can't figure out a sensible explanation of how money was transferred out of your address without you initiating it.

But when people stop running nodes, then the common resource - the network - is negatively impacted, and you have a kind of reverse tragedy of the commons.
This perspective is too narrow, though.  The common resource is not just the node network, but the ability to use the network to execute transactions.  In that case, all the people using the Bitcoin network without running a node themselves are contributing to a tragedy of the commons scenario.

I don't know anything about the internals of OKCoin, but I do trade there.
I think your skepticism about volume doesn't really make sense when you consider what a fantastic thing a no-fee exchange is for someone trading with bots.
On exchanges that charge a fee, every time you decide to get into or out of the market has a cost.  You need to make sure you can recover that cost.  At times of low volatility, the cost of the trade eats into profits, and can often make it not worthwhile trading at all.
When a bot can get in and out of the market with zero penalty, that changes everything.  For example, a bot can get into the market, make a tiny amount of money even on a very small price movement, and get out again.  It can do this in situations where on a fee-based exchange, the trade would have resulted in a loss.  More generally, when there's no cost to move into or out of the market, a bot can act more speculatively, taking a position, watch what happens, and respond, without having to worry about whether market conditions are good enough to recover the trading fees.
Because of this, bots are going to trade *much* more often on a no-fee exchange.  The volume isn't from lots of people with lots of bitcoins, its from relatively few people doing lots of trades of the same bitcoins.  In the aggregate, this produces a huge amount of volume compared to sites with a fee.  It's an entirely different world.
Of course, none of this guarantees that OKCoin's volume is all legitimate.  But I see no reason to think it's not, any more than any other exchange.

So what?  Businesses accepting Bitcoin now are certainly early adopters.  The point of mentioning the number of businesses that are accepting it is to show that there's an established successful model, via multiple payment processing firms, that businesses are using to accept Bitcoin.


Then they don't have to use it.  It's an option, which some customers may use.


No, because the payment processor is taking care of the exchange rates and so on.  From the perspective of the business, they just end up with dollars on their books like any other sale.


Because of the work the payment processors do, it doesn't complicate the business model beyond requiring that the staff understand how to run a Bitcoin sale.  


Millions of people live right in New York City, and don't have to drive there.  Stories about businesses accepting Bitcoin currently tend to get into the press.  So yes, they'll probably get a PR bump from the initial announcement of accepting Bitcoin, and they'll have a trendy payment option to offer customers, and they may pick up some new regulars as a result.  
Another reason people tend to do things like this is that having heard about it, they may wish to support the idea.  That's apparently the reason Overstock.com started accepting Bitcoin - the CEO likes the idea and wants to support it.  In fact, that's often one of the most powerful drivers of change.  The reason the Internet succeeded is not because big companies like AT&amp;T marketed it to customers, it's because when people heard about it, they wanted to use it.  Many people have the same sort of feeling about Bitcoin, which is where a lot of the enthusiasm comes from.

Well, that depends at least partly on the view one takes on breaking the laws of one's country, even if one disagrees with them.


You can dial back the melodrama, I have no desire to burn anyone.


I could be a serial killer who eats puppies, but it wouldn't affect the validity of what I'm saying.


You're being oversensitive.  Read the complaint, his own messages make it pretty clear that his motivation was greed, that his actions on this issue were incautious and ill-advised, as I described in my previous comment.  If you disagree, perhaps you could provide a different interpretation that is consistent with his own messages.  Perhaps I somehow missed an alternative possibility.


The evidence described in the criminal complaint makes it fairly clear that Shrem did the Fed's job for them - he incriminated himself badly in his own communications.  You can't use "out of context" or such excuses to get around some of those messages, and the lack of filing reports on BTCKing's activities.  Unless the prosecution is literally making up statements he made - which would be pretty unusual, since these things have to stand up in court - he might as well have signed an admission of (legal) guilt.  It's not as though we're talking about circumstantial evidence or unreliably eyewitness testimony.


I'm not advocating his life to be ruined, I'm pointing out that by his own statements laid out in the complaint, and the actions they imply, given the laws of his country he has brought any ruination of his life that occurs as a result upon himself.  Again, unless those messages are total fabrications, he can't claim to have been unaware of what he was doing.  This is just a statement of fact.


As I pointed out above, part of it comes down to how you think a civil society ought to work.  Do you just violate whatever laws you feel are unjust and expect no consequences?  What's your theory of what "ought" to happen here, and how do you reconcile it with the normal functioning of civil society?


My point is that given the situation he described in his messages, it is to be *expected* that he be "kidnapped".  If he did not want to risk that kidnapping, he should have acted differently.
You want the world to be different.  But we also have to live in the world as it is, even if we're working to change it.  You talked about the good Charlie did for his fellow people.  Why would he put that at risk over something like this?  To make more money?  Because he thought it would somehow help Bitcoin?  It was, as I said, ill-advised.

My favorite example to the contrary is [Harold Camping]( who predicted that the biblical Judgment Day would occur on Sep 6 1994, and then tried again with a doomsday schedule in 2011.  Amazingly, after that second try failed, he appears to have decided he had been wrong.
It's a strong practical demonstration of the power of actually testing one's hypotheses, and the dangers of keeping hypotheses unfalsifiable.

It's generally considered a feature, not a bug, that debit cards can be used like credit cards.  It allows them to be used in all the existing systems, including online and for recurring billing, without any changes.  
The main downside seems to be security, but the card companies have so far been quite successful at protecting customers from that, for the most part.  They have excellent computerized fraud detection and liberal protection policies, i.e. the customer is never normally liable for fraudulent transactions.
The Target hack compromised 100 million credit &amp; debit cards, so e.g. Chase just sent out 2 million replacement cards.  If that kind of thing becomes more frequent, it could be a motivation for change.  But otherwise, I suspect most people would say the system ain't broke.

And what was the transaction cost for that?  Also, how did the transfer of a fractional share work?  You're just ignoring what I'm pointing out.


The devil is in the details, and the details are nothing like Bitcoin, as I've explained.  If you really want to take this position, explain what market niche Paypal filled.  Why doesn't everyone just use stock, or some other existing medium of exchange to do the transactions it's used for?  Of course, many people do use credit cards online instead of Paypal, and those are even easier and cheaper to use for that purpose than stocks, but they still can't compete with Bitcoin.


Could you give me an example of a country that has that issue?  It will be fascinating to see what you come up with.  Other than places where it's prevented by law, this is simply a non-issue.
In fact, this is actually a good argument in favor of Bitcoin: in just a few years, Bitcoin has gone from brand new invention to being exchangeable in most countries around the world.  That's a consequence of its decentralized nature: anyone who's interested can start using it, it's not dependent on some financial institution opening up local branches around the world, or signing agreements with local merchants.

Bitcoin has no intrinsic value.
Modern fiat currencies also have no intrinsic value - e.g. if the US collapsed, or switched to Golden Eagle Freedom Bux tomorrow, the old paper dollars would become worthless.
Something like gold has intrinsic value, since even when it's not being used as a currency, there are other uses for it that people are willing to pay for.  That's intrinsic value.  
However, the intrinsic value of any commodity used as a currency is only ever going to be a tiny fraction of the total value in that economy, and as such, it's not actually important that a currency should have intrinsic value.  This was recognized when countries moved off gold and silver standards.

Minor but still significant point, it is already a unit of account with companies like Coinbase and anyone else who holds Bitcoin on behalf of customers.  One can quibble about the three traditional properties of currency with respect to Bitcoin, but the fact is it already serves all three purposes.
As people start accepting payment in Bitcoin, their comfort level at holding it is likely to rise on average, creating a stronger Bitcoin economy, and its significance as a unit of account will increase.
The real problem OP is having with Bitcoin is simply that it's volatile with respect to other currencies - so it's a currently poor store of value - and the company in question doesn't want to take on the exchange rate risk, and even wants to somehow insulate their customers from it.
@_date: 2014-03-17 22:13:43


It is literally not possible for that to be the case.  Anyone who's had any kind of exposure to academic computer science or mathematics can look at the Bitcoin paper and look at Dorian Nakamoto's background and tell you, definitively, that it is not possible that he could be the author of the paper.  
This goes beyond just "writing style" - it's a matter of expertise that requires many years to develop, and there's simply nothing in Dorian's background that indicates that he could have that expertise, and much to indicate that he doesn't.  There's a Financial Times blog that discusses an aspect of this, [here]( although it still focuses mostly on writing style rather than expertise, it gives some idea of the issues.
The problem is that most people, including Goodman, don't have the experience or knowledge to recognize this.  They live in a world informed by Hollywood movies, in which heroes solve intractable problems in minutes, and they have a completely unrealistic attitude to expertise.
Dorian Nakamoto isn't even close to having the background or expertise needed to have developed Bitcoin and written the Bitcoin paper, and the idea that he could have is beyond ludicrous.


In this case, they are.  Newsweek was looking for a story, and Goodman delivered one based on her limited understanding of a complex technical subject.  There's no mystery, only a combination of incompetence, desire for fame, and greed.

No, there's more to it than that.  You can read the full criminal complaint in the PDF linked at the bottom of the [Justice Department press release](  
They have evidence that BTCKing knew that the Bitcoin he was selling was being used to buy drugs, and he took active steps to work around regulations about structuring and reporting of financial transactions, which made what he did money laundering.  
Shrem in turn conspired with BTCKing to avoid legal reporting requirements, e.g. by accepting deposits higher than the maximum amount, by not reporting suspicious activity, and by helping to process the transactions personally.  
They're both charged with money laundering and with violation of reporting requirements.  It seems like a pretty clear cut case, given the laws in question.

No, fiat has no guaranteed value by law.  A currency that is backed by some commodity like gold has a value guaranteed by law, but modern currencies abandoned that approach nearly 50 years ago, because it wasn't viable in a modern, global economy.


That's incorrect.  Fiat money can and does lose value, and during times of economic crisis, that value loss can be extreme.  We've seen this happen in postwar Germany, and in various countries in South America and Africa, where you would need wheelbarrows full of paper currency to buy something simple like a loaf of bread.  
What gives the USD its value is the strength of the US economy.  That's the same thing that gives Bitcoin its value: as long as people are using it, it will have value.

All I meant by saying "the answer is obvious" is that bitcoin has many legitimate and useful purposes aside from being used to run national economies, which echoes the point you made yourself: "the fact that BTC should not replace the USD is irrelevant to the question of whether bitcoin will succeed."
Perhaps Krugman's concern is that BTC could do an end run around regulation and become a de facto national currency, which would obviously cause huge upheaval.  But if he's genuinely concerned about such issues, he's doing a very poor job of communicating them.


If it fails because it doesn't have enough actual use to offset speculative interest, then it probably doesn't deserve to succeed.  But that's a speculative criticism that is countered by the existing legitimate use of BTC which is only going to grow. 
It's certainly reasonable to warn unsophisticated investors against speculating on BTC, but that's no different from any volatile investment.  It's also reasonable to warn against holding a significant portions of one's assets in BTC, but again that's common sense.  None of these things detract significantly from the ordinary uses of BTC.  
Krugman appears to be indulging in politically-inspired FUD, and not even doing a convincing job of it at that.  He draws my criticism because he doesn't appear to be making a serious attempt at rational dialogue on an important topic.

As for financially savvy citizens, in my experience that can easily backfire - Wall Street people work in companies where there are whole departments taking care of details they're only vaguely aware of; they get inured to big numbers; and they often have boundless faith in the ability of financial products to solve any problem.

The problem in the case of Krugman's arguments is that his political opinions seem to have led him to present a rather haphazard argument focusing on arguing that Bitcoin should not succeed, rather than whether it can succeed or what to do about it if it does succeed.  Those with a more dispassionate perspective have had more interesting things to say about it.


I'm not comparing to Bitcoin users, I'm comparing to other analysts and looking at the quality of the arguments themselves.


Well, we have different notions of what is impressive, then.  I've transferred money across continents within hours with Bitcoin to address a real need that neither banks nor traditional money transmittal services address very well.  Foreign remittances alone are a huge industry, as are online purchases, international purchases, etc. etc.  You can be unimpressed all day long but in the end cryptocurrencies are going to have a place in global and national economies.  I would expect a reasonably neutral economist to be analyzing what that place might be, not demagoguing about the evils of this unfamiliar new thing.  Leave that to Bill O'Reilly.


"Decentralized" is only one of the interesting properties of these currencies.  If you haven't read it, check out the Wedbush report on Bitcoin which analyzes some of the properties that are likely to have an impact.


On that score, you disagree with Krugman.  The reason he's upset about Bitcoin is that he's concerned that it could be revolutionary, and have what he sees as a negative impact on economies.  Whether it is revolutionary or not is something we won't know for sure for some time.  Analyzing the impact it will have in future is probably not really an economist's job - the discipline is ill-suited to that kind of prediction.  So the best reaction is probably to nod politely, let the market run its course, and look to those with more interest in the subject matter than the politics for good analysis.

There's an implied false dichotomy in what you're saying, that the alternatives are either no safety or government backing.
The reality of the financial industry already shows that these aren't the only two options.  


Insurance does that kind of thing all the time.  Products are already being used in the Bitcoin world, e.g. to guard against loss of loaned funds at exchanges that offer leverage.  There are many possible commercial scenarios which could result in safe Bitcoin "banking" that doesn't depend on the health of a single company.  
In fact, Bitcoin enables models here that would have been much difficult to impossible in the pre-Bitcoin world.  The requirements for managing a Bitcoin account on behalf of someone else are rather different than for old-style money.  All you need to know is the Bitcoin addresses involved, and a secure distributed ledger for that account is already guaranteed.  This means that the service that a "bank" for Bitcoin is providing is really just the service of secure access to a resource that they only control in the sense that they hold a set of keys to it.  
All you would need to ensure that the failure of one bank would not compromise your Bitcoin account is to have another party that's aware of the keys.  Or there are models like Blockchain.info or Electrum, which have a centralized component but allow users themselves to hold the keys.
If you restrict yourself to trying to treat Bitcoin like old-fashioned money, you're not going to understand much of what's going on until after it's become established.  And then you'll kick yourself and go "duh, I was an idiot, it's so obvious!"  And you'll be right.

The problem with the criticisms that people like Krugman are making is that they're coming primarily from a normative position which reflects their political views and/or their lack of openness to a change in status quo, which really has nothing to do with how successful Bitcoin will or won't be.

It's very common for the prosecution and defendant to come to an agreement to avoid trial - see [plea bargain]( it "allows both parties to avoid a lengthy criminal trial and may allow criminal defendants to avoid the *risk* of conviction at trial on a more serious charge."
Note the word "risk" in the quote: there's no certainty when a case is brought.  A bank being prosecuted is going to spend a lot of money on its defense, and may find weaknesses in the case, even if only on technicalities.  So there's an element of risk for both sides in almost any case.  The plea bargain provides a certain outcome that's considered satisfactory to both parties, and saves a lot of money for both sides, including the taxpayer.
In [this article]( John Coffee, professor of law at Columbia Law School in New York, said that "These days they rarely sue individuals in any meaningful way when the entity will settle. This is largely a function of resource constraints, but also risk aversion, and a willingness to take the course of least resistance."
In the case of HSBC, one of the factors was certainly that if it lost its US banking license, the jobs of its US employees would be at risk.  HSBC Bank USA has 43,000 employees.  There was also concern about the impact on the banking system if such a large bank were to fold.

Debit card?  Coinbase doesn't support debit cards, only credit cards - I just double-checked by trying to add my Visa debit card, and it said "Debit cards currently not supported."
Also, it only uses cards as "backup payment method" - this probably has to do with the risk of chargebacks.

That's not realistic.  You can truly only "own" your money in the sense of exclusive possession and control when you're not using it for anything.  As soon as it becomes involved in a transaction, things get more complicated.  
This applies even to something as simple as ordering a product over the phone or internet - what's your protection against the seller not sending you the goods after you've sent the bitcoin?  In some cases, you may trust the seller enough, but in many cases, that's not wise.
One of the roles that credit card companies play is to act as a trusted third party and mediator between buyer and seller.  There's no less need for that service in with Bitcoin than there is with fiat money.  You can introduce all the technical innovations you can imagine and you're still going to need a trusted neutral party to be involved in many transactions.

I don't work in retail, but I would expect the answer to this question is indeed "no".  My understanding is that large retailers track returns, and if someone is abusing the return system, they can take appropriate action.


If accepting bitcoin in the first place doesn't already "turn the retailer into a money exchanger", then processing returns in local currency is unlikely to, for the reasons described above.  This is just a legal technicality which any competent legal department is not likely to have a problem addressing.

Maybe I'm not being clear.  I'll try to correct that.
Long-lostfriend started out saying "do not keep your coins on wallets where you and you alone do not control the private key."
Understood correctly, that's good advice - don't *keep* your coins in such wallets.  But that doesn't mean that during a trade, your coins might not pass through such a wallet.  As I pointed out, such arrangements can be essential when dealing with an untrusted party.
Long-lostfriend went on to turn the above advice into something much more extreme, and wrong: 




This advice is explicitly being derived from the issue of who controls your coins.  The implication is that if a service requires you to give up control of your coins in order to perform a transaction, you shouldn't use that service.  But that implies that *all* bitcoin exchanges shouldn't be used, and it also implies that any service that provides an escrow function of any kind shouldn't be used.  In other words, you can never use bitcoins to buy from an untrusted seller.  If people actually followed that rule, it'd be a huge disadvantage for bitcoin.  
Luckily, there are services that get around this problem: services like localbitcoin, and for that matter every bitcoin exchange.  They serve an important function in the bitcoin ecosystem, and advising people not to use them is counterproductive.

That's a good point about people locking themselves out of their cold wallets.  There's definitely still an issue with usability on things like that.
Personally I think blockchain.info is a pretty good compromise, for now.  It's not a cold wallet, but it's a wallet you control completely, and backups are essentially automatic, e.g. they email you an encrypted copy of the wallet when it changes.  Even if the blockchain.info site is hacked, they can't get your bitcoin since only you have the wallet keys, and even if the site shuts down, you can still use your wallet.


From the descriptions that have been given so far, it sounds as though they were replenishing their hot wallet from cold storage without proper accounting, so they didn't realize how much money they were losing to theft until it was too late.  


Now that law enforcement is involved, there's a limit to what the community is going to be able to do.
However, if you lost a lot, you should look into what legal options you have.  For example, there's more than one [class action suit]( - perhaps you could join one of those.  That could result in getting at least some of your money back.

Not really.  Traders and analysts always want to predict the future, so they make assumptions, state those assumptions if they're honest, and then use them to make predictions.  In evaluating those predictions, you consider the assumptions and decide the degree to which you accept them.  There's nothing wrong with that.
It's true that if there's a widespread assumption that historical trends will continue, without the sort of consideration I've just described, that can help inflate bubbles, but the 2007/8 collapse had many more significant factors that made it what it was.

I wasn't suggesting that you should hold cash, I was pointing out that the fact that you don't want to expose yourself to risk in a currency other than your local one does not make that "not a currency".
Your company does in fact hold cash, in various ways.  There's physical cash in the registers in your stores.  There's cash in your bank accounts.  You could not operate without some cash float.  Since that cash is in local currency, it does not expose you to exchange rate risk.  
If you accepted, say, New Zealand dollars in a US store, you'd have the same situation as with Bitcoin, with the only difference being that the NZD is currently less volatile.  If your management did not want to expose itself to exchange risk, it would have to immediately convert the NZD to USD.  This does not make it "not a currency", and having a volatile exchange rate doesn't make a currency not a currency.

You're right - in a perfect world, every security layer would use best practices, including password strength - defense in depth.
But you're focusing on the password issue because it's something you can see when you interact with a site.  You can't see how they're storing the passwords, whether they're encrypting them, hashing them, using salt, etc.  You can't see what measures they've taken to secure access to their database, etc. etc.  
If things get as far as a DB compromise, in the real world today there's a good chance that even your strong password won't save you, whether because of the issues mentioned above, or because the hackers were able to access or update your sensitive data anyway.
My point is not that it wouldn't be better to use stronger passwords.  But when you evaluate all of the possible attack vectors, the old-fashioned simple password rules are relatively low on the list of real threats.  Many big banks still rely on them, for example, and you don't hear about many bank password cracks, because they have better database security than a company like Adobe - i.e., they do have defense in depth, and the password layer is sufficiently strong to do the job.

Also see the paper [Plea Bargaining in England]( which discusses ways in which plea bargaining in the UK occurs both overtly and covertly, and also discusses some of the reasons for the differences with the US.  That paper is from 1978, so this is not just a recent practice.

That makes no sense, because they're all that the case is based on.  Look at the actual charges against the two, quoted from the Justice Dept release:
* FAIELLA, 52, of Cape Coral, Florida, and SHREM, 24, of New York, New York, are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, and one count of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
* SHREM is also charged with one count of willful failure to file a suspicious activity report, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.
That's it.
Now, the whole reason these statutes exist is for use in cases like this.  The reason your argument fails from a legal perspective is because you're trying to ignore this aspect of the law.  It's why this statement of yours has no legal force:


Sources operating within the law are subject to reporting regulations.  By operating an unlicensed money service business, Faiella made himself attractive to people wishing to perform illegal transactions, i.e. he facilitated criminal activity.  It was clear that he was aware of this, because he colluded with Shrem to circumvent reporting laws in his transactions with BitInstant.
So, in theory, this entire case could be prosecuted and won without ever mentioning drugs.  But this misses the fact that the rationale behind these laws is to be able to prosecute criminal value chains *without* the legal necessity of tying each link in the chain to the original criminal activity.  The drug transactions are the *motivation* for the case, but they're not the legal *basis* of it.  


That doesn't matter, because Faiella's service was illegal on its face.


Well, of course.  This isn't a discussion about the way we feel, it's about application of the actual law as currently written.

May I suggest in turn that you actually read the complaint, linked at the bottom of the Justice Dept press release?  You seem to be laboring under the misapprehension that this is a circumstantial case, but in fact there's direct evidence of guilt on all counts.
You're right that the money laundering charge goes beyond just compliance requirements, but in this case the conspiracy to commit money laundering follows almost directly from the fact that Shrem and Faiella apparently conspired to avoid complying with the reporting regulations: knowing that a transaction is designed at least in part to avoid a reporting requirement is part of the definition of money laundering.  
It's also a big red flag for investigators, who on that basis alone would have naturally looked for the other piece of the puzzle, namely evidence that the launderers knew that the proceeds in question represented unlawful activity.  Which they obtained in abundance, as described in the complaint.  For Faiella's part, see the last few pages, particularly 23, 24, and 25.  There was an undercover sting, plus an incriminating exchange with DPR, for example.


Yes, we can.  See Title 31, C.F.R. §1010.100 (ff) (5), "Money transmitter": "*(A) A person that provides money transmission services. The term “money transmission services” means the acceptance of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency from one person and the transmission of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency to another location or person by any means. “Any means” includes, but is not limited to, through a financial agency or institution; a Federal Reserve Bank or other facility of one or more Federal Reserve Banks, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, or both; an electronic funds transfer network; or an informal value transfer system; or (B) Any other person engaged in the transfer of funds.*"
The FinCEN guidance is just that: guidance.  Why do you think BitInstant registered as an MSB in March 2012, a year before any guidance from FinCEN?  Because they were attempting to be a legitimate business and follow the law, and would have consulted a lawyer.  Faiella, on the other hand, was accepting *anonymous* deposits, arranged on Silk Road, and exchanging them for Bitcoin, the extreme opposite of the legal requirements.  The complaint makes it clear he was aware this was illegal.


The pure MSB/AML/KYC charges would not need it, but sentences might be lower without the drug connection.  The laundering charges required some knowledge that the funds were being used illegally, and the complaint establishes that.

You get those by presenting your ID to a person who verifies it.  A machine can't do that.
When you apply for an account online, they get your social security number (in the US), and your name and address, and they can check that this matches credit bureau records.  In that case you're not getting any cash right away, they mail a card to an address that they've verified.
A immediate machine transaction doesn't have any of those verification "advantages", so machine owners need to have other options if they want to try to comply with KYC laws in their jursidiction.
If the Bitcoin ecosystem were more developed, an easier way to do it would be to have an account linked to the ATM.  You'd set up the account once, satisfying KYC, and after that you could use Bitcoin ATMs to convert Bitcoin without the hassle.  But as long as the machine is doing a "money services business" type of exchange transaction with unknown customers, KYC is a reality that many machine owners will have to deal with.

There's nothing tortured about it.
Faiella was violating financial regulations with his BTC/USD exchanges - he wasn't registered and didn't report any of his activity.  His clients were drug dealers, and he knew it.  Easy case there.
Shrem was violating financial regulations by dealing with Faiella, helping him to circumvent reporting requirements, and being aware of what Faiella was doing.  Another easy case there.

Depending on the context, showing your face may not be that risky.  If you did a cash transaction months ago and the person who took your cash didn't already know you, investigators aren't going to be able to prove anything.
By contrast, an unobfuscated blockchain record is there for the long term, just waiting for a patient investigator to track it down.

The example was slightly facetious, but unless I'm missing something, it's perfectly conceivable that a solution could be found that works in some cases and not others.  So you apply it to every address in the blockchain with a balance, and some of them work.  If it worked roughly 16% of the time you'd have your billion.

There's latent demand for it, so yes, there's movement towards it.  That's one big point that people underestimate: when the existing systems have shortcomings that a new system is able to address, demand to overcome the shortcomings in the old system tends to drive innovation in the new system.
Here's [one article]( about it, and here's [Western Union and Moneygram]( considering getting in on the action.
Another point that people tend to miss is just how archaic things tend to be behind the scenes in the financial industry, particularly in the US.  See this article on [the payments impasse](  Digital currencies have the potential to obsolete and/or replace big chunks of the existing banking infrastructure, and many of the financial players themselves may even find it in their interests to use it, because those big legacy systems cost money to run, get in the way of their own ability to innovate, and make the value chain that those companies belong to more expensive than it needs to be.  
Something like Bitcoin starts out eating away at the edges but ends up replacing much of the core, the way PCs did and the way the Internet did.


The ease of accepting Bitcoin for online transactions is such that buying things online directly with Bitcoin is unlikely to be much of a barrier in future.  That only leaves the question of how you get the Bitcoin in the first place.  Already, something like Coinbase is not much more hassle than Paypal, and we can expect that to equalize in future.  


All of this will be addressed as the market grows, so they're mostly not really objections to Bitcoin, it's more of an observation that it's not ready for truly large-scale consumer use yet.  But all the venture capital interest in the space will be trying to address that.  
BTW, on the purchase protection issue, the way it works with credit cards is not the only way, and it's imperfect anyway - invalid chargebacks, and invalid rejection of chargebacks, are both rife.  Somehow the world managed to survive without that system for a long time before credit cards convinced people that it was a good approach.  Reputable vendors return your money when you ask them to anyway, and deservedly gain great reputations from doing so (e.g. Amazon.)  Newer systems hardly ever mimic the systems they supplant feature-for-feature, instead the market adapts to new ways of doing business.

The reality is that if Bitcoin grows into a truly widely used system, you're going to see every possible model implemented.  Most of them already exist: "banks" like Coinbase; paper wallets; fully local wallets; distributed wallets like Electrum; and web+local wallets like Blockchain.info.

They had enough evidence to prosecute a criminal case, but a criminal case against a corporation does not necessarily result in throwing anyone in jail.  The corporation is a legal person and can be criminally prosecuted independently from its officers.

Part II of response:


Fines, resignations, and *cessation of the illegal activity*.  That's what makes it a good outcome.


Charlie Shrem was foolish in ways that HSBC executives were not.  Someone who takes steps not to get caught is always going to do better than someone who naively flouts the law and incriminates themselves with their own written record.  Shrem is a red herring in this context.  
Shrem was an executive at a reasonably well-funded company.  If he really insisted on breaking money-laundering laws, which itself was a foolish course of action, he could have done so in a much smarter way.  In that case, what would likely have happened would have been more similar to the HSBC case, where the company would have faced enforcement action, instead of an individual who left a convenient paper trail for the police being arrested.


No, it does not, it speaks to substantial difference in the two cases.  
Your argument here attempts to fit these things into an emotionally appealing narrative.  If your goal is to convince large numbers of people to vote your way, it might be a successful strategy - it's certainly a populist position.  But it's not rationally grounded, and it won't result in an improvement in the way financial systems and crime prevention works.
I'm not denying that income inequality exists, or selective enforcement, special treatment, etc., and that those things shouldn't be addressed.  But those are not significant factors in anything we're discussing.


He didn't "have to shut down his business."  Based on the numbers in your link, he could have afforded to comply with FinCEN requirements.  If he had done so and continued his business, he probably could have afforded to fight his classification as a money transmitter.  He apparently chose not to.


Won't someone think of the poor novelty coin makers?  This isn't a convincing argument.  If someone figured out a way to exploit Caldwell's coins for laundering, then that would justify the action.  If it turns out it can't practically be used for laundering, which is quite likely, someone in future wanting to take advantage of the latent demand for shiny trinkets containing bitcoin could apply to be classified in some other way, if it really makes a difference to them.


Precious metals are specifically regulated for money laundering purposes.  If it can be used to launder money effectively, then regulators are likely to pay attention to it.  
Here's an article about [expensive art being used for money laundering](  As the article points out, there are some challenges because of the nature of the art market.  Bitcoin doesn't have those same challenges, because it's fungible and it has public exchanges that set its price.  It's not difficult for regulators to fit Bitcoin into the existing paradigm, at least given its current uses.


No, currency has particular properties, like fungibility.  Money laundering laws apply differently to assets like real estate and cars than they do to currency.  Generally, there are already requirements that large transactions be registered in some way, and money laundering laws can often piggyback on those requirements.


Luckily, the situation you're concerned about doesn't exist.

The point is that same houses compete on the open market, and also sell to people who don't care about citizenship.
If you're imagining that the government is somehow relying on a real estate premium as income for the project, that's not the case.  They charge US$50,000 per applicant as a fee, plus various other fees for background checks etc. which amount to another $8,000.  And the law firms that handle the process charge as much as $25,000.  So the total income to the country ends up being around $80k, in addition to the price of the house.

That's not possible when what you're doing is exchanging bitcoin in a foreign country, to pay someone there.  For example, I've sent fiat money to people in Africa and Australia via bitcoin.
That's why localbitcoins provides an escrow feature and buyer/seller ratings.  It removes a lot of risk from the transactions.
And as I explained earlier, your advice generalizes to "never buy anything online with bitcoin", because we can't always deal directly with trusted parties online.
In general, the idea that all Bitcoin transactions should happen face to face would be pretty limiting for Bitcoin, and quite ironic for something that's billed as "the currency of the Internet" in the sidebar of this subreddit.  With that limitation, I'd never use it at all, and there'd be many people like me.  If you're interested in the success of Bitcoin, you might want to reconsider the advice you're giving people.

That was just a figure of speech.  Fiat is a car maker, which makes a type of car called Fiat, which for all realistic purposes are ridiculously tiny, since no-one outside Italy has ever seen any larger models.
The link you gave doesn't help your case: it's not a real car.  As an expert, I was able to tell right away.  You know how?  Most often, you can tell by the pixels, but in this case there was another clue: it wasn't ridiculously tiny!  According to [this article]( it is a rendering from a thesis by an industrial design student, Dragos Prodan, at the George Enescu University of Arts in Romania.
Now, I'm not sure Romania is even a real country - Europeans are always making up fake countries, like Lichtenstein and Belgium, in an attempt to confuse the CIA.  But for the sake of argument, let's assume Romania is real, and probably not too far from Italy.  In Romania, they all drive ridiculously tiny Fiats, since the economy is presumably based entirely on potatoes, so they can't afford any cars bigger than a Fiat.  So here we have our poor student Dragos Prodan, stuck getting a useless degree at a Romanian arts university, and wondering how he's going to escape his inevitable future of potato-digging.  A seemingly hopeless situation!
"I know," Drago thinks to himself, "I'll design a truck which will finally allow Fiat to break into the US market with a larger vehicle, something they've been trying unsuccessfully to do ever since 1899.  Fiat will hire me, I'll move to Italy, and escape a life of potato digging and live like a king in Turin, where I will spend my days choosing from the hordes of Italian supermodels desperate to be with me."
So thanks to Drago's desperate circumstances and enterprising nature, we now have a picture on the Internet of a Fiat that's not actually a Fiat.  And who knows, dreams do sometimes come true, perhaps we will one day see true 'Muricans driving Fiat pickups, despite how fantastical that sounds.  But for now, it's merely Drago's dream.

But if a merchant already using Paypal, and Paypal add Bitcoin support, then you could get the ability to accept Bitcoin with little to no effort.  In that case, it would be extra effort for the merchant if they wanted to add a button from one of the other Bitcoin processors.  
Paypal could probably afford to charge a premium because it supports other payment methods also, including credit cards and Paypal's own payment system, so it's a one-stop solution for merchants.
With dispute resolution, Paypal already handles that themselves for normal non-credit card Paypal transactions, afaik.  They already charge merchants a $20 fee per chargeback.  They could do something similar with Bitcoin.

What's really strange is that ever since we moved beyond direct barter, every currency ever has been "nothing more than an abstraction" - an abstraction of the value that it represents, i.e. the ability to exchange it for goods and services.  
Somehow, though, the nature of this particular abstraction confuses people endlessly.  It seems that the social acceptance of a currency - the agreement that it should be used as an abstraction of value - converts it into something that seems so concrete to many of its users that the idea of some other abstraction replacing it or competing with it seems both threatening and ridiculous.

Weather predictions don't simply look at correlations in data and extrapolate from that. They're based on an entire theory of meteorology.  Plugging data into a theory gives predictions, and this is part of what gives theories [predictive power](  
A theory is precisely what you're lacking.  A curve-fit is not a theory.
There are some situations in which a theory is not really needed - for example before Galileo or Newton came up with theories about the behavior of gravity, people relied on certain features of the observed behavior of gravity anyway.  But that's because the behavior was very consistent, extrapolations were reliable, and there were no indications of random behavior.


This is based on curve-fitting in hindsight.  If you doubt that, start keeping an honest log of predictions - whatever you feel comfortable predicting based on your theory, no matter how vague - and measure the accuracy of those predictions.


This is what reveals that you don't actually have a predictive indicator.
I'll add a caveat, which is this: there are certain broad patterns for which valid theories do exist, which constrain the possibilities.  For example, a crash will typically be followed by a rebound, which can be explained by various aspects of investor psychology, overreaction, herd behavior etc.
This makes it very tempting to look at a chart and say "aha, I see this pattern repeating over and over, I can use it as a predictive indicator!"  However, it doesn't work like that.  Until the pattern has completed, you don't know when it's going to complete: when you're in the middle of a crash, you don't know when the crash is going to end; when a rebound after a crash starts, you don't know when it'll peak or whether it's a "bull trap"; etc.  Again, this reveals that these patterns are not predictive.

The answer depends your perspective.  As you say, if you don't have any Bitcoins yet, then the hassle of getting set up just to buy something with it may not seem worth it.  You would have to care about at least some of the features of Bitcoin, like the security, the control over your own funds, the (relative) anonymity.
For people who're already involved in Bitcoin, they already have some and at least occasionally buy more, which is easy once you're set up at an exchange or via something like Coinbase.  In that case it's just a question of which is more attractive for a specific transaction, and possibly just to support Bitcoin's growth.

I think there's a risk that seeing an amount like  $45 translate to 100,000 bits will make the currency seem like Zimbabwe dollars or something.  It's popular in the dogecoin community, but that's a self-selecting demographic which is not necessarily representative of a larger audience.

The issue is simply that until there's an actual reason to think there's a problem, it's not necessary to start threatening customers.  A typical way these things are done is to make one attempt at contact without involving threats, and if the customer does not respond, then the request is escalated by getting into possible consequences.
I've had an interaction along these lines with one of my banks - the manager called and left a message, saying he needed to check on some transactions.  I called him back, we discussed it, he thanked me, and that was that.  No need to involve threats.  
If a bank is jumping straight to threats, then it's pretty clear that they're not really going to be taking my side in any disputes.  I've been through that kind of nonsense with a bank before, and there's an easy solution: find a bank that takes your business seriously.
Keep in mind that AML/KYC involves some discretion on the banks' part, so if they demonstrate lack of discretion, that's not a good sign.
Besides, it's not like this is the first time Chase's name has come up in these kinds of things.  Other banks seem to be achieving their compliance goals without this sort of behavior.  So it's extreme with respect to banking industry practice.


Actually, that's not what Amarkov wrote.  He said that it wasn't clear that it has anything to do with Bitcoin transaction *in general*, by which he means that the decision also takes into account other patterns of behavior on the account.


OP said he was doing transfers to Coinbase.  That is probably part of what triggered the inquiry, so yes, they probably do know it's Bitcoin.  Banks know the names of accounts wire transfers go to - it's pretty important for the whole KYC/AML thing.

The tulip comparison resonates with many people because they can't wrap their heads around the concept of chunks of abstract digital data being used to represent concrete value (other than its own content, e.g. they understand why the digital encoding of a movie is valuable.)  Tulips and bitcoin seem equally ridiculous in this sense.
There's a sense in which their intuition may have a quite rational basis: before the blockchain was invented, using bits of digital data as a currency had a fatal flaw, in that anyone could copy that data, and thus double spend.  Until one has internalized the fact that Bitcoin has solved this problem, the "feeling" that digital data can't be used as currency is likely to be strong.  Add to that the fact that most people have only a very vague notion of how currency works in the first place, and it's a recipe for non-understanding.

[New bitcoins are now far more likely to be spent rather than hoarded by speculators](
@_date: 2014-05-23 22:46:51


Not necessarily.  It all depends on the way new coins are issued - how often, how many.  
Although it's often abused, governments issue new money for legitimate reasons - see [money creation](  As the wealth that a currency represents grows, if new money isn't issued, then you get deflation, where the value of each unit of currency increases, so prices go down.  
That sounds like it might be a good thing, but in fact it tends not to be - it tends to lead to people hoarding money, and being unwilling to make loans.  This is one of the criticisms that economists make about Bitcoin, and it's probably one of the more valid criticisms.
So in that sense, as long as doge issuing is controlled well in the long term, it may be in a better situation than Bitcoin.

It might be like that if stocks were similar to Bitcoin in their ease and low cost of transferability.  They're not.  The reason Bitcoin is making waves as a medium of exchange is that BTC to BTC transfers are virtually friction-free by comparison to any other mechanism short of physical cash, and unlike physical cash, BTC can be transferred electronically and worldwide.  This alone has already changed the currency landscape, all that's happening now is people are working out and creating the details of how.  Some are slower at this than others.


With all the friction that applies to USD transactions, especially online.  If you can't see the benefit that Bitcoin provides in this area, then you're just going to have to wait and watch the future happen.  Even if Bitcoin itself isn't the ultimate or final digital currency, the idea of a decentralized global directly electronically transmissible currency is one of those ideas that like the Internet, will be difficult to put back in the bag.


It's always possible to convince *yourself* that the objections you've come up with are terminal.  But you're arguing a fundamentally weak position, which is that the way things are right now is the way they'll stay, even in the face of new technologies that change the rules of the game.

Not the same at all.  With credit cards, there's a third party that at least to some extent vets the chargebacks, and they can also be challenged.  In some cases, even completely legitimate chargebacks get denied, for various reasons.
A bitcoin double-spend is straight theft with no vetting or possibility of appeal.  If bitcoin were widely used at physical point of sales, this would be a serious problem for zeroconf transactions, far more serious than the issue of chargebacks.

Agreed.  A big part of these issues seems to be that companies that deal with people's money tend to be held to a higher standard than other companies, and many of the Bitcoin businesses either don't seem to have understood that, or simply aren't capable of delivering the kind of reliability that's expected.
@_date: 2014-01-28 20:28:04
Sure.  The point is that your argument that it lacks immediate widescale consumer adoption is meaningless, since that's simply not how technological change generally happens.
Actually, "Bitcoin" per se may not have a very long future, but digital currency in some form almost certainly does - it's emailable money, and the latent demand for something with that capability is very high.  
Bitcoin provides something of an indicator of that demand - even in its currently nascent state, it has global reach and interest, both positive and negative, from all quarters.  Even the negative interest is a reflection of what a threat to the status quo that emailable money is considered.
Right now, Bitcoin is the leading contender in that space, but it may be like early mobile phones, which consisted of a big box in the trunk of your car and a clunky wired handset up front.  As the software infrastructure around digital currency grows, and wider usage exposes which features are or aren't acceptable, Bitcoin will either change or be replaced.
But the reason it's like the previous technological changes I mentioned is that it provides new, highly attractive features, not previously possible, and people will use those features and come to depend on them.  Genies like this don't go back in the bottle.

One point you're missing is that the people using Bitcoin currently tend to be willing to accept a certain amount of mismatch between the value of their Bitcoins and their local currency.  Right now, this is unlikely to be an issue for a merchant.
Further, Bitcoin transactions in the foreseeable future are going to occur exclusively between computing devices such as smartphones or perhaps smartcards, which can take care of the mechanics of dealing with exchange rate.  In principle, there's no reason why a merchant should even need to care much about the Bitcoin price, as long as they offer a way for the customer to find out what it is - which again, smartphones and computers can take care of.

An operator of a BTM is classified as a money services business, by the definition of that classification: "remitting or transmitting funds by any means or through any individual, entity or electronic funds transfer network; or issuing or redeeming money orders, traveller's cheques or other similar negotiable instruments."
The other issue is that in the company's relationship with a bank, the bank needs to satisfy themselves that their client's activities don't violate the money laundering laws.
The specific identification and record-keeping requirements in this case can be found at [Record Keeping and Client Identification for Money Services Businesses](
Under 4.6 it says "To ascertain the identity of an individual, refer to the individual's birth certificate, driver's licence, passport, record of landing, permanent resident card or other similar document."
The biometric requirement is not mentioned specifically, but the issue is that because the interaction is automated, compliance requires some way of identifying the individual presenting an identity document to the machine.  Otherwise, someone could present a stolen ID document to the machine, and the basic purpose of customer identification would not have been satisfied.  RoboCoin's lawyers have presumably  concluded that a biometric identifier satisfies this requirement.  
What would you use instead, if you were trying to comply with this law?

First, this is semantics, but I'll come back to that.  Take out the whole sentence "his clients were drug dealers," and Faiella was still running an unregistered money service business.  Since he apparently knew what the money was being used for, that makes him complicit in laundering.
Now, if you're a Silk Road drug dealer and someone wants to buy drugs from you, you say "I can't take your cash online, but go to my buddy Faiella over there and exchange your cash for special weed tokens, then come back to me."  Faiella was a key part of the drug sale value chain on Silk Road, to the tune of $1m+ in cash, and you can't get around that with technicalities.

He's not treating it as a currency, he's treating it as an investment, like a stock.  Stock has intrinsic value because it's backed by a company with a revenue stream.
At this stage, arguing this point with someone like Buffett is a no-win scenario, because you'll just go in circles.  If you try to claim Bitcoin is a currency, he'll point out it's not a very good one, because volatility, and that it doesn't compete with the dollar, because fiat.

In real, non-trivial systems, caching the balance can often be essential, for the reasons gigitrix is mentioning.  "Millisecond fast" is not fast when you have large numbers of users, for example, and accessing and summing N rows will always be at least roughly N times slower than accessing one value.
The Stack Overflow thread you linked is arguing that it's a premature optimization.  It's true that it's an optimization, whether it's premature depends on what you know about the system's usage characteristics.

Amazon has 60 times Overstock's revenue, they're completely different sizes of business, you can't really compare them directly like that.

They're also doing it to save fees.


That could end up being a wash.  E.g. Tiger Direct gives you [$20 back for Bitcoin orders over $100]( and offers like that are likely to become common once merchants realize the advantages for them.
The bottom line is that if you don't care about any of the features Bitcoin currently offers, then it probably doesn't make sense for *you* right now.  But it makes sense for a lot of other people, and they're going to continue to drive adoption and growth in the Bitcoin ecosystem.
For example, the international remittances market is [worth over US$400 billion per year]( right now, and expect to go above $0.5 trillion in 2016.  Fees on those transactions are staggering: the World Bank estimates the average cost of those fees at 9.3%, because much of it is small amounts sent via expensive channels.  For example, someone using a bank wire to send $300 would pay about 10%.  Bitcoin has the potential to completely revolutionize that space - not directly, but via intermediaries that use the Bitcoin infrastructure.
The other point here is that Bitcoin provides "programmable money" - something that an entire global software payments infrastructure can be built on.  This will happen regardless of whether consumers see any point in it, because the existing financial infrastructure is closed, has high barriers to entry, and is generally not programmable without having serious relationships with big financial companies.
As the cryptocurrency infrastructure builds out, services that make more sense for consumers will start to become available.  You might not ever need to use Bitcoin directly, but chances are in a few years time that some of your financial transactions will involve cryptocurrency at some level behind the scenes.
Looking further ahead, the technology underlying Bitcoin - its secure, distributed public ledger - could be used to validate and transfer ownership of physical and intellectual property.  Instead of having a deed on file at a government office, or a copyright or trademark claim, you would have an entry in a Bitcoin-style blockchain, which would be yours to transfer to someone else in much the same way as you transfer Bitcoin.  You could email ownership of your house to someone.  Security might need a bit of work first...
What's really happening here is a lot like what happened with the early Internet - people who understand the systems that are currently in place see the potential, and are working towards building an infrastructure to realize that potential.  Until that infrastructure is built out, the case for Bitcoin for the average consumer won't seem compelling, but that doesn't mean there aren't incentives for it to grow.  You can see those incentives in action on a daily basis in the articles posted here on r/bitcoin.

This has nothing to do with the exchange rate with other currencies.  Even if the entire world was running purely in Bitcoin - in fact especially then - its deflationary nature would be a problem for debtors.  The issue is that the value of your debt keeps increasing, which makes it more difficult to pay it back.  
With a fixed-supply currency, as the economy trading that currency grows, the value of the currency will increase, and so prices of goods and services in that currency will tend to go down - and that includes salaries.  If you have debt in that currency, as deflation continues, your ability to pay back the debt diminishes.  
This can lead to scenarios in which even if interest rates on loans go to zero, it still isn't worth borrowing money, because the real (deflation-adjusted) interest rate is still too high.  A similar situation - deflation leading to low interest rates that are still unattractive - has happened often enough with fiat currencies that the response to it is well-established, namely, to increase the money supply.  See [Counteracting deflation](
The problem with Bitcoin is that there's no way to increase the money supply.  This is one of the things that makes Krugman unhappy.  I'm a Bitcoin fan myself, but realistically, he has a point: this feature will be a challenge if Bitcoin is to serve the role of a traditional currency.

They've lived their whole lives with things being a certain way, and they've learned to understand the rules that govern those things, to some extent.  Something that's very different is very difficult for them to assess, because their means of understanding is based on a different paradigm - they try to apply the old thing's rules to the new thing and get nonsensical results, and conclude that the new thing must be nonsensical.  
Preconceptions are the biggest barrier to learning anything, for young and old alike - but older people tend to have more of them.
That, and the fact that big changes risks making their knowledge and expertise obsolete, forcing them to learn something new, something they haven't had to do for decades.
Not all old people are like this, but in general society has traditionally encouraged a model of learning when you're young, then spending the rest of your life with that relatively fixed set of knowledge, and that suits many people just fine.
Another aspect to this is that this person is stuck in a top-down mode of thinking, i.e. societies should be controlled by those at the top, and he doesn't fully recognize the force that a bottom-up, distributed and decentralized approach can have, once it is enabled.  He has some inkling - some of the article is warning of its dangers - but if he really understood it, he'd realize that it is very difficult to stop such developments.  At best, national governments will have figure out how to coexist with decentralized digital currencies, they way they have had to figure out how to coexist with the Internet.

Utility is subjective - citizens are finding them useful, and will continue to do so in larger numbers.  Advantages to the consumer include greater security and control.  To best serve the needs of citizens, it would be most prudent to wait and see what uses Bitcoin ends up serving, much as was done for the Internet in its early regulation-free years.


A new global digital currency won't produce its own economy overnight.  If Bitcoin succeeds, it means a bigger Bitcoin economy.  Businesses receiving Bitcoin may use it to pay suppliers and employees.  Consumers may be paid in it and use it to buy goods and services.  In that respect, it will work like any other currency.


There are many options here.  It's a question of data storage, just like with existing money.  Services like the blockchain.info wallet already provide a good option: a wallet under the user's local control, that can be used from multiple devices, and that can be stored and backed up to multiple locations online and offline.  Where there's demand for a solution to issues like this, there'll be companies to satisfy that demand, and a wide array of solutions.  
Even today, we have local wallets, paper wallets, online distributed wallets like blockchain.info's, and wallets held by third parties like Coinbase and the exchanges.  The purely local wallets, stored in a single location, are likely to be an early anomaly that will be replaced by more fault-tolerant systems.  In general, wallet technology will become much simpler to use in future.  There are already VC-funded companies working on this.

There's a misleading mental disconnect that people use when talking about "the state" as though it's somehow completely disconnected from the desires of your fellow citizens.
The reality of the anti-drug laws is that until quite recently, they have largely reflected what much of the population believes.  Take a look at the DARE program, for example, which is supported by parents throughout the US.  While its primary focus is on children, its overall position is against the use of controlled drugs in general.
So in cases like this, the reality is that "the state" is just a conveniently anonymous proxy for "the majority of my neighbors", or perhaps "those people in other more conservative states."  There are over 300 million people in the US, and they all have to get along somehow to avoid killing each other in a massive bloodbath in which libertarian redditors would be the least likely to survive.
In such an environment, there are always going to be laws you don't agree with.  But part of the point of laws is that by being a member of a society that has them, you agree to follow those laws, even the ones you disagree with.
Of course, in reality, people violate laws all the time, and get away with it.  At the low end, you have traffic violations, personal drug use, petty theft, etc.  Some of these get detected and prosecuted, but many more go undetected and unpunished.  But as you move up the scale, things start to get more serious.  If someone is actively taking steps to hide the source of millions of dollars in income, it's pretty certain that the source of that money goes beyond just someone's minor personal transgressions of the law.  
Anti-money laundering laws targets those scenarios.  While it may be that sometimes such laws are used against people who've done nothing more than sell a metric buttload of weed, in practice there are plenty of cases that involve much less benign activities.  The laws are not written to discriminate between different types of lawbreaking: anyone breaking the law and attempting to hide the fact that the source of their funds is illegal is a target.
So if you're against the drug laws, fine, work to have them changed, protest them, break them, whatever.  But that is really a separate issue from whether anti-money laundering laws are a good idea.  To determine that, you need to look at their actual application and see how important they really are to non-drug-related law enforcement.  A little thought goes a long way here: crime is much harder if criminals can't easily spend their money.

Add a qualifier to my sentence if it makes you happy: "...often won't precede..." for the general case.


Best practices are not modeled on such anecdotes.  In general, most people receiving payment for their work will want transfer that payment somewhere at some point.  Since this case sounds like an ongoing relationship, as I said, payments won't precede all the spend.
Regardless of this point, your proposed approach still makes no sense in terms of addressing the issue about revealing information:


That provides no benefit, since that transaction can easily be traced through the blockchain.
The point of receiving different payments on different addresses is that there's no one address that, once identified, will allow you to easily investigate all of a person's financial activity stemming from that payment relationship.  
Your proposed approach doesn't achieve anything, and whether payments precede spend or not doesn't make any difference to that.

Spending Bitcoin is the main reason for its existence, so if you want to "get into Bitcoin," the way to do that is to buy Bitcoin and use it.  If, on the other hand, you mean you want to get into Bitcoin to do speculative trading, then the question is, why do you think it's worth anything?  Why do you want to get into it?  
The only real answer to that is that it's worth something because people use it to spend, so if you don't understand why people use it to spend, then it implies that you don't understand why Bitcoin is worth anything, in which case, why do you want to get into it?
I'm not criticizing, just pointing out the implications behind what you say you want, and your question.

That could happen, although once established Bitcoin could probably recover from such a scenario fairly easily.
The problem is, without services like that, most real businesses would not even consider adopting Bitcoin at this time.  So it's a tradeoff - either Bitcoin grows slowly amongst true believers who are willing to deal themselves with high volatility, currency exchange issues, etc., or it grows much quicker by depending on businesses that provide services that the average business expects to be able to rely on.
You have to start somewhere.  The Bitcoin economy barely exists right now - no-one that I know of lives using only Bitcoin and never needs to convert to fiat, the way billions of people do with their local currency.  Until there's a bigger Bitcoin economy, making it useful to the average person or business requires the services that you're complaining about.

What does that have to do with anything?  We're talking about a scenario which you raised, not about what I do.  The reason I don't keep most of my money in btc is exchange rate volatility, it has nothing to do with concern about robbery.
In the express kidnapping scenario, you would simply need to make sure that the wallets that the kidnappers knew about, or could easily find out about, don't have very large balances in them.  So for example, you shouldn't carry all your money on your phone, or in a paper wallet on your person.  That's what I do - on my phone, I have three wallets, none of them with high balances.  
If you're really concerned, you could even keep paper wallets in a bank safety deposit box, or hidden at your house, or whatever makes sense for you, with an encrypted backup on a server somewhere.  Whatever makes you comfortable is possible to do.
You haven't explained how someone would "lose everything".  It sounds to me like you're thinking you'd keep all your money in a wallet that you carry with you, but why would you do that?  If you're foolish with your money, you're likely to lose it.  That's just as true with pesos as with btc.

On the contrary, a consequentialist might claim exactly that - that under some circumstances, the overall beneficial consequences of an action support violating an individual's rights.  Or, a moral realist may point out that we don't get to control moral facts, no matter how logical some conclusion may seem to us.
If you like, you can argue that such positions do not in fact recognize rights as you understand them, but again, that's not important to this discussion.  This discussion started when anne-nonymous wrote "*Newsweek author uses journalism to do something potentially very irresponsible. If there isn't some price to that (no death threats, but something), future journalists will use their power in the same irresponsible manner.*"  Notably, s/he didn't say anything about rights, so whether or not we take privacy as an absolute right, or a conditional right or privilege, is not the issue.
The issue is that your response, "an ethical person ought to wish that ethical rights be extended to all persons universally and uniformly," makes various assumptions which are not universally true of "an ethical person", and depend entirely on what sort of ethical system is being followed, on whether privacy is considered an absolute right within that ethical system, and indeed on whether rights as you understand them exist within that system.
It would be difficult to generalize about what "an ethical person ought to wish" in a situation, without first specifying an ethical system.  If such a generalization were possible, there would not be so many ethical systems, and moral realism would be a much more plausible position.


If we're going to continue this discussion, perhaps you could point me to a source which puts this definition of yours in context.  I'm guessing you may be coming at this from a legal perspective, but that's just the context in which I'm most familiar with the distinction you're making.  In metaethics, the definitions are not so universal and unambiguous.  Here's [some discussion of that](


No, I don't agree.  That's true in some ethical systems, not others.  Consider the death penalty, which exists in numerous contexts where humans are considered to have a right to life.
I have the sense you may be confusing ethical positions you find compelling with universal ethical principles.  As much as we might like the study of ethics to provide a way to reach unambiguous ethical conclusions, reality is not quite so obliging.

Plea bargains save a lot of money and time.  Besides, abolishing them entirely seems like a step backwards.  In principle, the idea of the opposing sides coming to an agreement is a valuable and civilized outcome - this is used to good effect in civil cases all the time.  
In criminal cases, presumably the concern is that justice isn't being served somehow.  But in that case, you need to look again at the rationale: both parties get a guaranteed outcome, and save money and time for themselves and the taxpayer.  
To abolish them, a similarly efficient alternative would be needed, or else a much bigger fraction of US GDP would have to be devoted to the entire legal infrastructure.  How much are you willing to raise taxes for this?

There's no indication that anything like that is happening here.  All that's happening is that existing laws relating to money handling are being enforced, in order to prosecute crimes that have long been considered a high priority by law enforcement.
In the meantime, there are numerous legal Bitcoin businesses in the US, a whole lot of legitimate investor dollars in play, and guidance from the Treasury Department regarding Bitcoin businesses began almost a year ago and was continued recently.
As others have pointed out, if anything, this sort of law enforcement can be a good thing for Bitcoin, if it makes it clear that it has a legitimate role and that law enforcement will step in when it's used in illegal ways.

That's trust in the aggregate rational activity of market participants, which any market requires.
The only thing Bitcoin guarantees is that you don't have to trust any individual person or company to accurately keep and report the record of transactions and resulting balance.
But I agree with your general objection - people seem to love to equivocate on words like "trustless" and take them as some absolute property, as though Bitcoin has somehow abolished all need for trust.  I think part of the problem is that people are so used to depending on trust they don't recognize quite how pervasive that dependence is.

I agree with your general perspective.  However, I don't quite accept this:


It's actually *not* his job to make decisions about "the cost/benefit to society," except in a very narrow sense.  The kind of broad social analysis you're suggesting is something that needs to happen at many different levels - a national conversation, in effect.  
As superintendent of financial services in New York, he's charged with supervising financial businesses in New York, and protecting consumers, etc.  Now, it's possible to justify a lot in the name of "protecting consumers" - it's a lot like "protecting the children."  But in a democracy, as opposed to a centrally-planned society, it is not up to people like him to preemptively decide what to allow or disallow citizens to do.  We can exercise our rights as free citizens, as long as it doesn't break existing laws.
What he *should* be looking at is how to encourage and foster the growth of legal cryptocurrency businesses in New York, by providing a clear regulatory environment for them to operate in, so that they know what is expected of them if they are to stay on the right side of the law.  
That shouldn't be as difficult as all that - the whole AML/KYC infrastructure is already well established and cryptocurrency businesses in the US (and elsewhere!) are complying with it, all that's really needed is for them to say "Digital currency businesses are OK in New York," with some additional details to clarify regulatory expectations on different types of business, along the lines that FinCEN has been doing for nearly a year now.

Which study is that?  You may have misunderstood what it's saying, e.g. perhaps it was saying that the average transaction is small.  But certainly "almost never" is a ridiculous overstatement.  You can watch activity on the exchanges yourself to see that this is wrong.  E.g. look at the charts at bitcoinwisdom.com.
For example, on just one exchange, BTC-e, about 35,000 coins traded on Jan 6th (Monday of last week.)  That dropped the price by about 17%.  The next day, another 30,000 coins traded, raising the price by about 8%.  There were also similar trading volumes on other exchanges at the time.
So while it will affect the price, these are not unusually high trading levels or price swings.  The effects such trades have on the price are part of the "normal" volatility that Bitcoin is experiencing while the market is still relatively small and inefficient.
@_date: 2014-01-07 20:36:54


The only reason you really need is that some customers want to use it.  They may have obtained it in various ways, purchasing with USD or other state currency is not the only option.  They may have mined it, received it as a gift, been paid for goods or services with it, etc.  The latter option - that they've been paid with it - is likely to increase in future.  In that case, your argument can be turned around - if you're a merchant, why force them to exchange their Bitcoin when you can satisfy their needs more directly?
There are also other benefits to accepting Bitcoin from the merchant's perspective:
1. Transaction fees are much lower than e.g. credit card fees.  Especially in businesses with thin margins, like most retailing, this can be a big advantage.
2. Bitcoin doesn't allow chargebacks, the way credit cards do. 
3. And as noted in the OP, "our security folks love the idea of not having to keep customer payment information for PCI compliance, etc, when processing BTC, so that's an advantage. Think about Target (one of our competitors) and the CC issues recently. These issues are significantly reduced in a BTC world."


See above.  Keep in mind that in a changing environment, attempting to apply the old rules tends to lead to wrong conclusions.  That's what you did when you wondered "why accept btc at all" - you weren't thinking in terms of an environment where people actually routinely have BTC.  
Bitcoin is in the process of changing the future, so to understand it you have to think about what that future is likely to look like.  Businesses who are looking at accepting BTC today aren't doing so because of the vast amounts of money they think they'll take in today, they're doing it because they see future potential and they want to help realize that potential.

You don't have to be.  I'm purely talking about the needs of many kinds of transactions.


I didn't claim otherwise.  I said there's a need for trusted third parties, which is a role that credit card companies do fulfill.  Going back to your original point, "chargebacks" are valid service in some cases, and even in a pure Bitcoin economy without credit cards, it's likely that companies would provide those kinds of services.


I think you've misunderstood what I'm saying.  I'm simply describing facts.  You complained about the issue of not owning your money; I pointed out that you can only truly own your money when you're not using it, that there's a valid role for services which act as mediators between buyers and sellers, and that this is a role that credit card companies fulfill.

It's not that simple.  National currencies were *backed* by gold and silver, meaning that the government promised to exchange the currency for a certain amount of the backing metal.  That promise became hugely problematic in bad market conditions.  There's no equivalent of that in the Bitcoin case.  That's not to say that deflation won't occur with Bitcoin - it has to - but the analogy to gold doesn't hold.


It's a nice thing to say from the comfort of an armchair, and you're not alone.  I'm rather amazed by all the prominent people who say things like this, without providing or suggesting any plausible alternative.  As long as that's the case, the perfect altcoin is never going to arise, because no-one is even seriously discussing what its properties should be, they're all too busy complaining that Bitcoin is not it.  
When this sort of thing happens, the way things usually work out is the thing that people says can't work will be adapted until it does.  So yeah, the implementation of Bitcoin in March of 2014 is not the future, but we know that by definition since we know it'll have future versions.
The internet itself is an example of this.  If you told people in 1995 that the Internet would be the future of X, where X is marketing or shopping or banking or social interaction or whatever, very few people believed you.  Because you had to connect to the internet with a slow dialup modem, and it wasn't even designed for marketing or shopping or banking or social interaction.
So ultimately, your sentence quoted above is both trivially true and very likely meaningfully false at the same time.

It eliminates the need for trust in one specific problem - and in fact, what it actually does is move the locus of trust to a network of computers that's difficult to fool.  There's no reason to imagine it has any impact on "the need for trust" in any other areas.


Scammers have always existed, and exploiting trust is one of their major strategies.  But it doesn't work as well in a face-to-face environment.  People want to trust because they're evolved, social beings, and trust is a valuable tool in any society.  
In offline life, people tend to follow strategies that have been validated by game theory, such as [tit for tat]( which rely for their effectiveness on the ability to have repeated interactions with the person you're dealing with, who traditionally was present in the roughly same physical location as you.  
Most people have not adjusted to the degree to which dealing with strangers across the internet changes this innate tendency to trust until proven wrong, which is the tit for tat strategy in a nutshell.

It's not like the idea of a public blockchain is some sort of nefarious plot.  If you want to be able to make decentralized, trustless payments, a public distributed ledger is the obvious way to do it.  Satoshi didn't invent that idea, he came up with the first viable implementation of it.


Of course they would... but it's not.


There's nothing special about Bitcoin that will somehow make it viable when the rest of the "global financial system" is not.  As long as real wealth exists, all that's needed is some way to represent that wealth in order to trade.  That's not a hard problem - almost every country in the world has its own currency.  People might lose faith in the financial shenanigans of governments and central banks, and a more vibrant Bitcoin economy might become attractive to more people, but the idea of a global financial catastrophe driving people to Bitcoin is a fantasy with no rational basis.

Surely you must have known that the Bitcoin exchange rate was volatile.  As has been pointed out, most merchants convert immediately to their local currency for that reason, and Bitcoin payment processors support that.  What was the thought process that led you to do otherwise?

I don't think there's anything you can do to stop yourself being investigated in those situations, but if you've done things by the book it shouldn't be a long investigation.  You get a lawyer, and probably end up just cooperating, turning over the relevant details.
In the BitInstant case, Faiella was apparently exchanging tens of thousands of dollars a week through BitInstant, all while avoid compliance requirements with Shrem's knowledge.  That's in the ballpark of $1m plus per year.  If you were involved in something criminal on that scale, you'd probably know about it.  
On a smaller scale, you'd have to really piss off an investigator for them to even care about you - they would only want to satisfy themselves that you weren't actively involved, that you weren't obstructing the investigation, and that you appeared to have acted in good faith, in compliance with regulations, i.e. that your business in general is legit.


They need more evidence than that to even charge you with anything.  Despite all the cynicism about this sort of thing you see on reddit, the reality is that investigators are not going to care about you beyond your immediate usefulness to them, unless there's a good reason.

[Here's the article](  Michel Abner Espinoza offered to sell Bitcoin to an undercover cop.  After doing one transaction to establish some trust, for the second transaction they met in a Haagen Dazs ice cream shop in Miami Beach.  The cop told him that he "needed to buy bitcoins to pay for stolen credit card numbers" and that "he was in the business of buying stolen credit card numbers from Russian sellers."  Those are quotes from the criminal affidavit.
The connection to the current post is that some idiot/troll ("Sniper338Lapua") in the posted thread on Bitcointalk claimed that "i can assure you that any amount now over $300 usd IS ILLEGAL as [my lawyer] received calls from 3 clients here in Florida this weekend who were taken into custody for selling bitcoin through craigslist or local bitcoin."
Something very similar happened to Silk Road Bitcoin merchant BTCKing: BTCKing sold Bitcoin to an undercover cop who told BTCKing that he needed it to buy cocaine (if I'm remembering correctly.)  This is one of the big links in the chain that allowed them to charge and arrest Charlie Shrem of BitInstant, because he processed BTCKing's Bitcoin sales without complying with the anti-money laundering reporting laws, with full knowledge that the money was being used for illegal purposes.  (These claims are based on his own emails as described in the criminal complaint.)

I'm not sure its "biggest problem" is anonymity.  For a start, it's not truly anonymous, it's [pseudonymous](  All transactions are public record, which is more than you can say for cash.  
All that is needed is to link someone's real identity to a Bitcoin address that they control or previously controlled, and investigators have a treasure trove of transaction links that they can follow to any depth they like, without needing warrants.  In many ways, this is an investigator's dream come true.
This was important in the FBI investigation of Silk Road, and helped them to catch Ross Ulbricht.  It was also important in the money laundering investigation described in the OP.


You may be underestimating the power of traditional regulation and enforcement on the behavior of businesses.  
As it is, the IRS can't just peer into your bank account and see what you're doing, so plain old bank accounts can be just fine for hiding money if you're so inclined.  And if it gets to the point of being audited, then unless you're very careful about money laundering - itself a crime - then they're likely to find evidence of transfers to a Bitcoin exchanger, so at least some of your Bitcoin activity will be found - wallets, addresses - and it's game over.
Not to say that Bitcoin can't be used to evade taxes - just like offshore bank accounts, etc. - but it's not quite the anonymous untraceable thing that people often think it is, or make it out to be.

No-one is saying "cost equals value", as far as I can tell.
You're right that it's probably more accurate to say that unforgeability "secures its value".  But that's another way of saying "ensure its value is higher than it would be otherwise".  In other words, unforgeability can contribute to "monetary value" (the term Szabo used): as demand for an unforgeable asset rises, so does its monetary value.


This is true if you're talking about intrinsic value, use value, etc., but for monetary value, although it's true in some cases, it's incorrect in general.  The cases where it's true are where demand is very low relative to supply - in that case, the cost of production will not have much impact on monetary value.  But if demand his high, cost of production will often affect value, because producers will not want to produce and sell below their cost.

This is not guaranteed to work.  Their page says "The likelihood is approximately the same as the percentage of mines using bitundo. Right now, this is pretty low."

Glorious?  No, I am just a humble handsome redditor, but the "female asshole" is a reference to the reporter, Leah McGrath Goodman.  Her story has resulted in attention that cannot be avoided or escaped, as though she has been grafted onto Dorian Nakamoto.  
Using a play on the different meanings of the word "asshole", the humble, handsome wordsmith and poet Arthur Nakamoto created a metaphor whose unfiltered genius will shine on through the ages, in which Goodman is represented as an actual biological asshole "transferred onto [his] brother's rear end".  The "surgeon operating without an ethical or moral license" represents Goodman and Newsweek, and possibly other members of the media and public who have exacerbated the situation.

I think you may be missing what's happening here.  This wine bar is interested in accepting Bitcoins from customers.  This doesn't have to affect the wine bar's relationship with its suppliers in any way.
The reason is that the route most businesses have taken to be able to accept Bitcoin is to use a payment processor, like Bitpay or Coinbase, who provides the tools and the service to be able to accept Bitcoin and convert it to dollars at the point of sale.  
Essentially, from the perspective of a business doing this, it's little different than accepting something like Paypal or even credit cards - except there's no risk of chargebacks, which as I said, is a good thing from the point of view of the business accepting Bitcoin.


So in the scenario we're talking about, that becomes a risk the customer takes - that if they have a complaint and expect money back, they are dependent on the wine bar to agree to refund it, there's no third party who can intervene (short of the court system.)  This is not a risk for the wine bar.


All they're trying to do is use it as a means of accepting payment, and for that reason, none of your concerns are applicable.  Including tax liability.

If you're not actively using the coins for anything, then yes, you can and should store them in your own wallet - although this does come with extra concerns like backup and security.
People who store BTC with an exchange typically do so because they are trading there, in which case the exchange holds both your BTC and fiat currency and allows you to trade between the two - that's necessary so that trades can be made without credit risk.
Apparently some people also used exchanges like Gox just to hold their BTC, either because of laziness or inexperience.  That was, unfortunately, a dumb thing to do.

Even if it goes to zero, a lot depends on when that happens.  If it goes to 10,000 before it goes to zero, that can still be a very good investment, although not a passive one.


Unless you have some very strong evidence, that's a feeling that you would do best to learn to dismiss.  Such feelings are natural, but irrational.  When these feelings do turn out to have any validity, it's usually only by accident, as in a broken clock being right twice a day.
A nice example of this type of irrationality came from the co-inventor of Ethernet, Bob Metcalfe, who predicted in 1995 that [the Internet would collapse]( the next year.  This was based on a feeling that the technical underpinnings could not handle the rapidly growing traffic volume - even though his technical knowledge should have allowed him to recognize that he was wrong.
The same psychological principle is at work here as that which underpins doomsday cults.  The article [Psychology Reveals the Comforts of the Apocalypse]( discusses this.  One relevant point is that "Apocalyptic beliefs make existential threats ... predictable."  Believing in an imminent global collapse gives you a way to address your fears about such an event - you feel more in control when you've taken steps to mitigate such an event.
That might seem fairly benign, like having a security blanket, but once you've begun down this road there's a tendency for the belief to become stronger in spite of evidence to the contrary - see [Why believers will grow stronger when the world doesn't end](

Perhaps not, but the answer to the question "why does this keep happening" is because many of the mechanisms that societies have developed over the last few centuries or more to protect financial transactions have been scrapped with Bitcoin.  Government regulations are a big part of that.
OP may not be crying out for regulations, but others are, for various reasons.  True believers may maintain that all these exchange failures, thefts, and frauds don't mean that regulations are needed, but it's going to be an easy sell to everyone else.  Officials will say "Bitcoin has demonstrated the importance of regulation" and everyone will nod their heads and sign on the dotted line.

Keeping bitcoin on an exchange is a choice.  The only legitimate reason to do that is because you're regularly trading with some other currency, in which case the centralization, in the form of escrow and settlement services provided by the exchange, is a requirement that bitcoin currently shares with every other asset exchange in existence - although blockchain-like technology could certainly be used in future to implement more decentralized models.
The problem with MtGox was simple - people who were used to operating in a highly regulated environment, in which a huge infrastructure exists to protect them from incompetence and fraud, didn't realize the implications of the new environment they were operating in.  As such, they placed an unreasonable level of trust in MtGox and didn't react as they should have to obvious warning signs, which began at least a year or more ago.  I'm not making a case for or against regulation here, but one's financial actions need to take into account the nature of the parties you're trusting your money to.
Finally, Gox wasn't just an exchange, it also provided a hosted wallet service.  Bitcoin is still new enough that people aren't well educated on how to store their bitcoin appropriately.  Many people apparently used Gox to store their bitcoin because they thought it was convenient, or because they didn't take the trouble to educate themselves on alternatives.  Those who did this made two mistakes: one was to use a hosted wallet service in the first place, where your coins are no longer directly in your control; and the other was to trust MtGox in particular, despite all the warning signs.
None of this has any bearing on "the point of Bitcoin" as a secure, decentralized digital currency.  What it does tell us is that there's some way to go in terms of educating users, making proper use of Bitcoin simpler and friendlier, and improving the Bitcoin services ecosystem.  This is all par for the course in the uptake of a major new technological innovation.

For large amounts, perhaps, depending on the country and the availability of liquidity on exchanges like localbitcoins.com.  I just transferred $500 from US to South Africa.  It was much cheaper than a SWIFT transfer through my bank (which costs something like $30, I've done them before).  The whole process took less than 3 hours before the money was confirmed in the SA bank account, which is unprecedented in my experience.  A SWIFT transfer initiated by an ordinary customer normally takes days - this may be partly a limitation of the South African banks, but whatever the reason, the Bitcoin route was much faster.
So, for a tech-savvy user who's also not entirely risk-averse (e.g. willing to use localbitcoins), and for suitable amounts and countries, Bitcoin is not "absolutely terrible" - it's already capable of being significantly better than the existing options.


For international transfers, as ease of use improves there's like to be huge interest from ordinary immigrants wanting to send money to/from home.  That's a pretty big global market.  It'll get easier to do, as money-transferring agencies start using Bitcoin as the channel for the transfers, so the average person doesn't have to deal with exchanging between currencies on both ends.
Don't think of Bitcoin purely as a consumer-facing tool.  It'll be used by a lot of businesses to build products on, and in that role the idea that there's "no real case to use it" evaporates.
Also, btw, the idea that there's no real case for most people to use it would imply that there's also no real case for most people to use a service like Paypal.  Yet somehow Paypal has lots of customers, why is that?  I find it difficult to understand how people can look at a digital currency that can be safely transferred across the Internet, without depending on a sketchy centralized service like Paypal, and say "what possible use could it have".  One of us must be missing something huge.

That's only because Bitcoins are being treated as a foreign currency.  When I look at my bank statement, I don't translate it into something else to figure out how much it's worth, because it's already in the currency that I use most often.
So this comes back to the point that until the Bitcoin economy is large and diverse enough to use it as a primary currency, it will be somewhat weak on various properties that currencies are expected to have.

I can print small sheets of paper labeled "Fifty Dollars" on my computer, but I can't sell them without state's permission?  Does nobody see how insane this is?
Your question would make more sense if you could frame it in its context.
These laws apply to people who are making a business out of selling digital currency.  In general, business of any kind is regulated to some degree or another in modern economies.  You have to register for business licenses, file information about your income, costs, and profits for tax purposes, etc.  If you take issue with this entire infrastructure, then your question goes beyond getting permission to sell virtual tokens.
In the case of digital currency, there's an additional aspect which is that "following the money" is a major tool that law enforcement uses to prosecute people who are involved in facilitating crimes, not just those directly committing the crime itself.  These laws make a big difference in enforcement against crimes like theft, fraud, robbery, arms dealing - anything that involves selling and buying stolen or proscribed goods.
Whether the currency used to facilitate these crimes is a state-backed piece of paper or a "virtual token" doesn't make any difference.  Registration as a money services business helps ensure that people buying and selling currency are participating in a system that makes it more difficult for criminals to do untraceable transactions.
On its face, this is not "insane."  It's part of an effort to deal with criminal behavior.  In most cases, these laws developed in response to particular situations that were difficult for law enforcement to deal with - things like [international organized crime]( or the use of purchase and resale of things like cars and real estate to hide the proceeds of crimes.

It's clear that Github has not been competent at maintaining high uptimes, pretty much by definition of the word 'competent': "having the necessary ability, knowledge, or skill to do something successfully."
So this comes back to my earlier question, which is what is meant when we call people competent in this context.
I agree with you, it's premature to be making accusations of incompetence.  That wasn't my intent.  But calling the site management "really competent" in defense of the outage strikes me as somewhat self-contradictory.  I suppose part of the point is that they're considered competent enough to fix the problem.  But it would be even more competent if they had not allowed it to happen in the first place.
I admit that my attitude to this is certainly affected by seeing these software issues happen frequently at different Bitcoin startups.  I feel like Samuel Jackson on that plane.  I know for a fact that it's possible to do a better job.  In cases like MtGox and some of the others, it's clear that competence in software development was indeed a major issue.  I agree that's probably not the case, at least not to the same extent, with blockchain.info.  I look forward to the post mortem.

Banks aren't likely to care about that.  Right now, the Bitcoin hardware is not particularly massive, especially when compared to financial industry hardware.
If banks decided to use cryptocurrency to transfer between each other, all they'd need to do is each run a small network of their own, or pay someone to run nodes for them.

That's only true as long as the accounts are primarily in some other currency.

Do you mean that Bitcoin is backed by fiat money, or that Bitcoin is fiat money?  Either way, it's incorrect by the definitions of those terms.  
[Fiat money]( is money that's defined as money by law, which doesn't apply to Bitcoin.  
"Backed" in the sense of [currency backing]( means that a currency is redeemable for a commodity which backs it, from the issuer of the currency.  This means that even if the market for the currency is weak, you can always go to the issuer and trade the currency for an agreed-upon quantity of the backing commodity.
When you sell Bitcoin for dollars, euro, yen, etc. you're not "redeeming" it - you're trading with someone else who considers the currency to have value.  There's no entity that "backs" the currency.  If everyone stopped believing in the value of Bitcoin, and so stopped buying it on exchanges, there's nowhere you can go to redeem your Bitcoin.  It is not backed by anything.  
The same is true of the US dollar, btw: unlike Bitcoin, the dollar is fiat money.  The fiat laws which created it help ensure its value, but it is not backed by anything.  It used to be backed by gold, but not any more.

I agree, it seems pretty obvious to me that this is how it'll go.  Bitcoin is the core protocol, more like TCP/IP for money than email for money.  While people *can* use it directly, most people in future will use it via services layered on top of the core protocol.

"Stranger" alone doesn't imply that you know nothing about a person - for example, when you walk into a bank, you assume that the people behind the counter waiting to serve you are tellers even if you don't know them, i.e. they're strangers to you.
The term "random stranger" is commonly used to emphasize that one doesn't know anything about the stranger in question, that they've been picked at random from a pool of people with no known properties in common.  "Arbitrary stranger" was presumably intended to indicate something similar.

My comment was responding to the statement "don't trade online with LB", which I quoted at the beginning of the comment.  That claim is essentially equivalent to saying "don't use bitcoins online," because the logic behind it applies to most kinds of bitcoin trade.
It's perfectly reasonable to say that you shouldn't keep your coins under someone else's control on a long-term basis.  But generalizing this to the point of saying "don't trade online" (with LB or anyone else) is ridiculous.  If you don't trade online with bitcoin, what exactly are you going to do with it?

So take the Bitcoin Foundation away.  Now you have a large ecosystem of companies involved in Bitcoin, with revenue that depends on Bitcoin, employees whose salaries depend on Bitcoin, and customers who depend on their services.  And they all depend on this common technology that needs further development, maintenance, and cooperation.  Guess how such organizations usually cooperate?  With some sort of joint organization, like a foundation.


Who has that perception?  Why do they have it?  Authority in a scenario like this comes from consensus.  Technology is full of organizations that make large distributed systems governable: the Apache Foundation, the W3 Consortium, the IETF, the list is endless.  Bitcoin is nothing new or different in this respect.


It's a technology that allows us to maintain a secure public ledger, it doesn't do anything to change human collaboration models unless they involve asset transfer.

You're confused.  The basic interest rate in question is 0.2% per *day*.  The effective APR (i.e. with compounding) is 107.3%.  You can calculate this with: (1.002^365 - 1) * 100.
It's easy to see why 0.2% per day couldn't possibly be an APR of 7.3%: because even without compounding, 7.3% divided by 0.2% is just 36.5 days.  Keep that up for a year and you're up to 73%.  That would be the "nominal APR".

If you're selling Bitcoin and your buyer *tells you* he's going to do something illegal with them, then you're either talking to a very dumb criminal, or a cop.  Either way, you should back out of the transaction, in which case you have a good chance of being allowed to carry on with your life.

No, it hasn't.  This is the precise error that the original quote is intended to challenge.  You've basically been fooled by a correlation into thinking you have a useful indicator.
The claim you're making relies on hindsight to adjust for errors in the prediction, and to select which features of past performance should be extrapolated.
For example, looking at the Bitcoin price chart right now, there are two obvious major trends: one is a steady and consistent downtrend that began on Dec 4 and predicts that the price will hit $200 by October; the other is the uptrend that claims that the recent trend is part of a correction that will reverse and continue its upward climb.  
If past performance were really a predictor, you should be able to predict when the current downtrend will end.  Want to take a stab at that, so we can check how well this really works?
There are also other trends that can be drawn, depending on where you start from and how you fit your predictive curve to the data.  With enough parameters, it's possible to fit any curve to a given dataset, and make it look like you've found a predictive formula.  But it's only predictive for the past.  But exactly the same is true for the simplest curve-fits.
A good introduction to thinking properly about such things is Taleb's book [Fooled by Randomness]( which among other things, "examines what randomness means in business and in life and why human beings are so prone to mistake dumb luck for consummate skill."


Then it's not a predictor.  It's as simple as that.

All laws are.


If so, Shrem's lawyers can raise that in court, and get evidence excluded. That also happens every. single. day.


If any violation nullified all agreements, no agreements would ever be possible.


I've already agreed with you on that point, with the exception that one should do so without violating agreed-on rules.


You seem to have labeled me this because you think I'm anti-profit, in contradiction to what I've actually said.  What am I to conclude from this?  That your reading comprehension and cognitive capacity is too low to be worth holding a discussion with?  Shape up or shut up.
Besides, putting labels on people like this is a way to avoid thinking and understanding.  It's a primitive form of compression, which is most commonly used by people with limited cognitive capacities to help them simplify a complex world.  If you keep it up, you'll find yourself a good match for the average Fox News viewer.




If that had ever been demonstrated in action somewhere, it might be a more interesting claim.


I haven't mentioned the word "government".  For example, Bitcoin has laws, which are enforced by its software.  There are also humans reaching agreements on how that software should be modified in future.  Who gets a say in those modifications?  You certainly don't.  In future, if Bitcoin were the only currency in the world, do you think that would be a satisfactory state of affairs?  Would whoever hired the strongest private army gets to control Bitcoin, perhaps?

Your logic generalizes to "don't buy anything online with Bitcoin", and if people followed your advice, Bitcoin would be useless in practice.
When you purchase *anything* online with Bitcoin, whether it's a physical item or just fiat money, there's a trust issue: how do you know that the seller is going to send you your stuff?
In some cases, we don't worry too much about this: e.g. we trust that Overstock is going to send the sheets that we paid for with Bitcoin.  But in many cases, you may be dealing with someone you don't know, and trusting them is often not wise.
In those cases, having a trusted third party to manage the transaction is essential.  That's not going to change in the forseeable future - all that *can* change is who you trust.  There has to be trust involved somewhere along the line, even in fancy distributed exchanges, multi-sig transactions, etc.
In the case of localbitcoin, like all Bitcoin exchanges, they act as a trusted third party to manage transactions between parties who don't know each other.  This is a good, necessary function, and your "moral" quoted above is anti-Bitcoin, since it makes Bitcoin less useful and trustworthy.
Please don't spread misinformation, it only hurts Bitcoin.

Everything you say is true, but it in no way affects the original point, which is that this is all decades in the future, at best, so talking about "the era of asteroid mining" in relation to bitcoin is rather irrelevant - especially when talking to Congress which is not usually known for its starry-eyed flights of futuristic fancy (with the exception of military projects like Reagan's Star Wars program.)
Currently, there's no orbital platform even remotely close to being able to support a mining operation.  If you realistically compare the current state of the art, i.e. the ISS, to what will be needed to support mining, simply building out that basic infrastructure will likely take decades.


On average "three" is probably closer to the truth than hundreds, because the relative cheapness of the current space startups will change as it becomes a more realistic enterprise.  This is the same cycle that startups of all kinds go through - they start out operating on a shoestring, but as they scale they face the same efficiency challenges as every large organization, and they tend find out the hard way where their risk profile needs to be mitigated, and that costs money.

Advocating its use as a currency is very different from advocating speculative trading.  Other currencies have exchanges, but in those cases forex trading is secondary to the use of the currency itself.
To have 150 BTC on an exchange implies that most likely, they were looking to get rich quick, by investing in and/or trading a highly speculative and risky market.

Perhaps, but it still doesn't really have much bearing on a case of someone who got directly and personally involved in money laundering, knew what he was doing, and incriminated himself in emails.
One reason larger companies can get away with this sort of thing is because their size gives them a degree of deniability.  Managers can claim "I had no idea!" and unless they were dumb enough to put it in writing, it can be difficult to make charges stick to specific people.  So, in these cases, the state will penalize the company, and perhaps reach some sort of settlement about termination of executives if the company doesn't do that of its own accord.
BitInstant was too small to pull that sort of trick, and Charlie Shrem wasn't smart about it.  His best course of action would have been not to get involved in money laundering in the first place, but failing that, he really would have needed to be much more circumspect in his written communications, and avoided directly handling the transactions in question himself.  He incriminated himself quite badly.
As such, it's a bit misleading to compare the two cases.

You seem to be looking at it from a consumer perspective, a user of an enormous network which you're not fully aware of, but there's a bigger picture.  Sure, if you already have the right kind of account with a financial institution, it's easy to buy and sell stock, for a non-trivial transaction fee.  But that depends on an enormous and far-reaching infrastructure, specific to trading stocks, that has developed over many decades.  The dependence on that infrastructure is why it's expensive to trade stocks relative to a cryptocurrency.
Try sending 0.01 shares of IBM held in the US to someone in another country, who has no US presence, and get back to me on how that goes, especially about what it costs, and what hoops the other party had to jump through to be able to receive it.
Have you ever transferred say $5 to a buddy's cellphone using stock as the medium of exchange?  If you need to pay an amount to a friend on the other side of the country, do you use stock?  Try using stock to purchase something at any of the stores that now accept Bitcoin, or buy a giftcard with your stock.
Why do you think stocks aren't normally used for these purposes?  Do you think it was viable to do this all along, and somehow people just didn't think of doing something like that until Bitcoin came along?  
Do you think Paypal is a fad that doesn't serve any purpose?  Because according to you, it should be just as easy to use stock to do what Paypal does.
The answer to all of this is that cryptocurrency transfers are much cheaper, more friction-free, and flexible than any other medium of exchange currently in use - with the possible exception of physical cash, which can't be transferred electronically and presents problems when dividing it up - try paying your buddy $2 when all you have is a $20 bill.
Anyone in the world with access to the Internet and some sort of computing device, including a smartphone, can download the software for a Bitcoin wallet and start accepting and making Bitcoin payments.  Merchants can do it without involving any third parties at all - they don't have to open a merchant account, be approved, or anything.  That's just one example of a huge change in the status quo that, as I said ealier, has already happened - all that's happening now is that people are getting used to it and understanding its implications.  It's because of this ease of entry and subsequent ease and cheapness of use that cryptocurrencies have a guaranteed place in the future of the world economy.

One likely approach would be that Paypal would essentially add some Coinbase-style features.  You'd fund a Bitcoin wallet that Paypal manages (just like Coinbase), but then you'd be able to purchase with your Bitcoin from any store that supports Paypal.  Paypal would charge the store a fee, but it would be lower than credit card fees, so everybody wins.

Whether they're building on top of other technologies or not is not the issue - rather, it's the need to develop an entirely new ecosystem of supporting services and software, work the bugs out in actual use with early adopters, and cycle as the system grows with new groups of increasingly less sophisticated users.  These changes are less about technology and more about adoption, including adoption by businesses offering services.
Changing the way that people deal with money is a massive undertaking.  Bitcoin has already had incredible success in that area in a very short period of time, so much so that people are starting to mistake its ecosystem for something much more mature than it actually is.  
People seem to be coming into it expecting a consumer experience on the level of other commercially-backed payment products, and although superficially that does exist for Bitcoin, there are enough weaknesses in the ecosystem that people who aren't sufficiently aware or knowledgeable can easily run into trouble - both users and Bitcoin businesses.  
This is a perfectly normal part of the adoption cycle.  The weaknesses people actually encounter are the ones that businesses will rush to address.

There are 54 countries in Africa.  Having a Bitcoin exchange in one of them doesn't help any of the others, because using it would still involve foreign exchange.
There are already Bitcoin exchanges in at least one of those countries, South Africa.  But the people who are using remittance services are often people without bank accounts who mostly use cash.  They have no way to get money from a normal Bitcoin exchange.  
Even people who do have a bank account often won't have Internet access, or a telephone.  Even if they have a mobile phone, many of them aren't comfortable banking over the phone.  They normally go to a branch and deal with a human face to face.  So you need people to provide these services, and branches all over the place.  That's expensive to set up.
The way that money transmittal services like Western Union work is they have a large network of agents, so if you send money to someone in Africa they can go to any WU agent - e.g. a grocery store - show their ID, and get the cash that was sent to them.  
A network like that takes time &amp; money to build.  And the reality is that once a company has such a network, they're likely to charge as much as they can for using it.  And that's why the rates run around 9% - 12%.

You'll find that almost everyone involved in law enforcement and financial regulation will not have a problem with that.  The reason is that they have information that you apparently don't yet have:


There are two problems with that statement.  
First, one example of the laws not working as hoped doesn't say anything about all the cases in which they are used effectively.  
Second, in the HSBC case, the executives involved resigned or were terminated, bank management was rearranged, bank practices were changed, and a multi-billion dollar fine was levied.  For those actually concerned about the ability to enforce laws, a good outcome was achieved, and the bank is no longer actively and knowingly assisting in money laundering.  If anything, they're erring on the other side now.  The populist perspectives on the outcome have more to do with unfocused anger and ignorance than any facts in the case.
The information that law enforcement and financial regulators have is that anti-money laundering laws have been a very effective tool for prosecuting crimes of all kinds across the world, including some of the most high profile crimes like organized crime and terrorism.
In the US, the laws are used [by the FBI]( and [by the IRS]( and by state governments in prosecuting crimes.  Similar laws are used by governments around the world.   The International Monetary Fund is involved in a worldwide effort to [improve money laundering enforcement worldwide](  
The motivation for all this is simple: being able to track and prosecute criminals - not just the people actually stealing and robbing and selling bad stuff, but the people helping them hide their crimes.  And it works.


There's no proposal on the table, these are existing laws being applied to something that's being used as a monetary instrument.  Something similar applies if you use cars or real estate for the same purpose.  The statements from FinCEN are "guidance", explaining to people how the law applies to Bitcoin.  No-one who's ever consulted a lawyer about any of this would be surprised by any of this guidance, but it helps to be sure that everyone's on the same page, so that businesses don't have to be concerned that they might be breaking the law unknowingly.
In any case, the stifling effect here seems minimal.  The actual cases that have been enforced involve idiots who have sold Bitcoin to undercover cops who *told them* that they were going to use the Bitcoin for illegal purposes like purchasing stolen credit card numbers.  
Someone making a living via localbitcoins should probably register as an MSB if they want to avoid any issues.  I know some people have done exactly that.  If you don't do it, chances are that unless you sell enormous amounts of Bitcoin, or knowingly sell to criminals, no-one is going to pay attention to you.  And if you are selling enormous amounts of Bitcoin, you have the money to pay a lawyer to file a registration for you.  
This is just business as usual in a first world economy.


I'm not clear on what you're getting at.  If you can get money into the system without being able to track its source, that's a hole that money launderers can exploit.

It's not just about developing a piece of open source software.  The decisions that go into that software affect all the users of a currency.  That currency has a diverse group of stakeholders - I listed some of them in my previous comment - and not all of them are developers.  What's the process for raising issues, deciding on a resolution, and allocating resources to implementing it?  What ensures that stakeholder concerns are considered?  What ensures fairness?
There are completely standard ways to approach these things, and nothing about Bitcoin makes it an exception to the need for such processes.  If anything, if you want Bitcoin to succeed as a global currency, it will need process protections that go beyond the ones I mentioned, like W3C and IETF.  
If you're not clear on the kinds of processes I'm referring to, take a look at the [W3C Process Document](  The Table of Contents gives a good idea of the kinds of issues that arise and require an agreed-on process to address.
We're not just talking about people's web experience here, we're talking about something that can directly affect the value of their life savings.  It's simply not viable to entrust something so critical to a large population to whoever has the resources to develop the software.  The potential for abuse in that situation is so great that it's not a question of if it'll get abused, but when.

In the case of Bitcoin, that's hardly likely to be an issue because all the reasons that people would actually *use* Bitcoin, as opposed to speculate on it, clearly don't apply to its derivatives - e.g. you can't put a BTC derivative into your mobile wallet and use it to pay for your beer.
Someone who's treating Bitcoin as an investment vehicle needs to have some minimum understanding of what they're doing, there's no way around that.  The mechanics of digital currency are pretty complex, despite all the intro videos, and caveat emptor applies as always. 
Even in the absence of derivatives, many Bitcoin users today are taking on counterparty risk by using e.g. Coinbase wallets.  That seems like a potentially much bigger confusion for the average user than distinguishing Bitcoin from its derivatives.
Further, the issue you've raised assumes a narrow view of the benefits of Bitcoin: "a product designed to eliminate [counterparty risk]."  Most ordinary Bitcoin users and investors will not be using Bitcoin directly or purely for that reason.  Some may not care about it at all, and that may be perfectly valid for their needs.
The confusion you've identified applies better to stocks, bonds, etc. because they're not directly tradeable in the same way that Bitcoins are, and the reason that investors might confuse an asset with its derivative in that case is that they're viewing it purely as a potentially appreciating store of value, so don't find the asset/derivative distinction important.  That can also be a valid perspective.
The closest equivalent to the Bitcoin situation would be cash, and in that case it's analogous to the distinction between having physical cash in your wallet and having some asset in a financial account.  Even "average investors" understand that distinction.


Any powerful tool has downsides, but that's a separate issue from the question of whether the average Bitcoin user will understand the distinction between holding Bitcoin and holding its derivatives.

I already commented on that point, saying "even the reported connections you mention are a bit suspect. I think it's pretty unlikely that banks are actually closing accounts due to government pressure because they're involved in something like porn."
The article you linked is sensationalism to attract readership, nothing more.  Apply Betteridge's Law to the headline and you know all you need to know.  Keep in mind that headline writers are certainly aware of Betteridge's Law, and ask yourself when and why they would go ahead and use that form anyway.
You can read a more considered article in Mother Jones, which is hardly a pro-banking, pro-government source:
The reality is that the few porn industry people that have had their accounts closed by Chase were probably doing something specific that Chase considered high risk.  The [Daily Beast pointed out]( that "many adult performers earn money from a variety of backdoor methods which may give banks pause."  That article also estimates that "the number of people impacted by Chase account closures is closer to tens than hundreds."  
None of this is consistent with the idea that government guidance is leading to a crackdown on porn industry bank accounts.  On the contrary, the government guidance explicitly contradicts that, saying that even industries associated with high risk activities "properly manage these relationships and risks are neither prohibited nor discouraged from providing payment processing services to customers operating in compliance with applicable law.
I'm not defending the account closures, or defending Chase, or Operation Choke Point.  I'm glad, in the face of things like that, that Bitcoin exists.  But they're not closing porn star accounts just because they're involved in the porn industry.


All those things probably seem scary if you've grown up in a first world country.  I grew up in Africa, and lived through capital controls, wars, frequent terrorism (bombs in shopping malls and government buildings), government confiscation of property, restrictions on free association, etc.  Perhaps surprisingly, life goes on, despite the fervent attempts of the crazies to fuck everything up.  The kinds of things you're worrying about will be tried, and pushed back against, and things will continue to get worse and better at the same time.  Realistically, the US isn't going to need to worry about doomsday for another few generations at least.

The requirements for web site login security are different than the requirements for something that can be attacked offline, like a bitcoin "local" wallet.
If someone gets a copy of a wallet file somehow, they can throw computing resources at trying to guess the password.  They can make many billions of guesses a day, and the typical web site password following the rules you quoted would typically fall in less than a day.
But on a web site, you typically get a limited number of attempts to log in before the account is locked, so the fact that a password could be cracked with 10 billion guesses is not a real concern.
Instead, the concern for them is that they're dealing with a lot of users who are inclined to use passwords like "password."  Forcing them to use "Password3" instead does in fact make their account significantly more secure.
The fact that you don't get to use your preferred password style on such a site is not an actual security threat.
Of course, it would be better if systems did a password entropy analysis when you choose a password, instead of relying on trivial rules.  But that gets into how the software industry is so balkanized and low on reuse.  For an individual site, depending on the language and framework they're using, in most cases, there won't be a drop-in library to do that.  So we end up with homegrown solutions that do the job with minimal effort.

It's not clear to me what your concern is on this supposed restriction of legal sale.  The regulations in question affect people whose business is to sell the tokens, it doesn't apply to ordinary users of the tokens.
As long as these tokens are being used in practice for no other purpose than as what FinCEN calls "convertible virtual currency," and (perhaps primarily) as an instrument of speculation, it makes sense in the context of current laws to regulate those whose business is to sell them.
What future applications are you concerned might be inhibited by the MSB/AML laws?
If I want to use a blockchain approach to record, say, the sale of physical property, I don't see anything about the existing regulations that fundamentally prevent that sort of application from being developed.

This will happen regardless of whether consumers see any point in it, because the existing financial infrastructure is closed, has high barriers to entry, and is generally not programmable without having serious relationships with big financial companies.

Based on the last 95 days, you'd have to say "doubles at least every 95 days."
If we work backwards from today, the USD/BTC price has doubled in 78 days, since Nov 13th.  
If we look back 95 days, to October 27th, the price was around 175.  It took 19 days after that for it to double to 350.  The next doubling, to 700, took 10 days.  That was not long before the China crash, and double that price has not yet been reached, but we have until Feb 25th for that if the 95-day rule is to hold.  
Currently we stand at a factor of about 4.5 over the price 95 days ago.
Although, given the shape of that 95-day chart, one could be forgiven for thinking that we might have settled on a kind of *(bumpy) plateau around the 800 mark, and could be there for a while.  The moon may have to wait a while.

You need to reread what I wrote, because I'm not disparaging Krugman - that would be an ad hominem - or the other economists who've come out with such arguments against Bitcoin, I'm point out that the *criticisms* they're putting forward are largely normative in a way which reflects their political views and/or affinity for the status quo.  As such, those criticisms are of limited relevance to those who don't share their subjective perspective on such issues. 
Nor am I disparaging "an entire field of study".  By "people like Krugman", I am referring specifically to those who are making normative and status-quo-based arguments against Bitcoin, which also include e.g. Lisa Kramer of U. Toronto and various other finance commentators who've taken anti-Bitcoin positions.  There are quite a few economists and other analysts who've taken more measured positions on the subject.
Further, your argument from authority in a case like this is particularly questionable, since in these situations in which a new system raises the potential for altering the status quo, members of the "old guard" are notorious for missing the possibilities.
One reason for this is that preconceptions are the biggest barrier to understanding something new, and someone who has devoted their life to studying some existing system has to expend real effort to determine which aspects of their knowledge are preconceptions that may not apply unchanged to a new system.  There are clear signs of this issue in the critiques I'm referring to.


You're falling prey to an equivocation: the kind of latent demand that exists for currency and payment system features that don't exist in current systems is not the same as the kind of demand that is manifest in an existing market.  Such latent demand is not something that can be determined simply by examining existing economic data.  I am suggesting that these critics have not fully recognized the existence or extent of this latent demand, and until they make an attempt to understand that, they're likely to reach questionable conclusions.

You're incorrect on that point.  Look at the word "launder" in e.g. Merriam-Webster:


Note the parenthesized clause and the use of "as", implying that other kinds of money transfers to conceal the true source can also qualify as laundering.
Now look at what originally wrote:


He's using the word in its dictionary sense.
You're apparently confusing it with the legal term "money laundering," which is obviously related but in a legal context, refers to a specific crime.  That's not the same sense in which used the word "launder".
As someone on [urban dictionary]( put it:


Further, in the discussion here, whether the activity fits the stricter legal definition depends on why the source of income is being obscured, which wasn't specified.  I said that "realistically, laundering is a pretty accurate term" because, realistically, the reasons that someone would go to the trouble is likely to involve some attempt to circumvent laws, which would often fit the stricter definition.

Google and Microsoft might disagree...


It's a tradeoff.  If you want a company that's going to hold your hand and spend a lot of money to make sure you have a seamless experience, you need to find expensive companies that make good profits from the extra money you pay them, and who reinvest some of those profits in the customer experience.  Apple is a classic example.  
But you're not going to find many companies like that in the Bitcoin space right now, and especially when it comes to companies that offer services that are either incredibly cheap or free, you need to have realistic expectations.
In this particular case, it's not something that compromises your wallet, and unconfirmed transactions are a known possibility with Bitcoin.  It's more a case of requiring awareness and education, until rough edges like this are a thing of the past.

Five years isn't much in the adoption of a significantly different new technology.  New technologies often take 20 years to incubate and develop.  The internet itself, with the TCP/IP protocol, existed in the early 1980s.  It wasn't until 10 years later that it started to see wider public adoption, and it took another 5 to 10 years after that to become truly widely used.
In many ways, Bitcoin is suffering because news of something like this spreads much faster with the internet - so it's getting attention from people who would never normally have heard about something like Bitcoin at such an early point in its lifecycle.
If Bitcoin were a commercial product, it would be under much tighter control and all the tiny startups we're seeing wouldn't be able to exist, because Bitcoin Inc. wouldn't have opened things up enough.  In that scenario, all the turmoil we're seeing would be happening behind closed doors and in private beta tests as a company struggled to work out the kinks, and you wouldn't know anything about it until some figurehead got on a stage at a tech conference to announce it.
So what you're seeing is the process of a new, decentralized protocol for money having the kinks worked out in real time.  It's inevitably going to be messy.  We're not going to get good service companies in the Bitcoin space without a lot of bad ones trying and failing.

With comments like this, you're not doing much to combat the impression of you given in the article.  Perhaps you're not actually a sexist jerk, but if so you seem rather insensitive to the issues women face in these situations, e.g.:


The comment by AWholeHeapOfTrouble already pointed out the problem with this: it's a no-win situation for women, because if they're assertive in defending themselves against sexism and inappropriate passes (e.g. "Oh ok cool, so if we start dating I can use the app with you!"), they run the risk of vindictive backlash from men with hurt feelings, and such reactions are often supported by other men.
You sound a bit obtuse on this subject, so I'll give you the benefit of the doubt that you don't *intend* to be a jerk, but you should really read the article more carefully, think about what you said, and think about the situation from her perspective.
On your comment about her being "such a victim", she's not claiming that, and this sort of hyperbole kind of underscores the point about the cost for women being assertive in these situations.  Here's one of the points made in the article:

Ok, but YesYesLibertarians was implying that it was a libertarian ideology that was being "indisputably implemented".  I don't think that libertarian ideology implies that all transactions should be public - in fact I would have thought the opposite.  That requirement is a technical feature of Bitcoin, not a fundamental requirement for trustless payment.  Public transactions just allow for a simpler implementation.
The point is that Bitcoin is a mixed bag, feature-wise, in terms of implementing the goals of any particular ideology.  You could argue that the blockchain helps implements the citizen-tracking ideology behind [Total Information Awareness]( for example.

You're arguing from a kind of maximally agnostic perspective which is more appropriate to a philosophy class than a courtroom - there's a possible world in which Faiella just had no idea that some of the money he was handling was drug money.  But this sort of argument doesn't hold up in court, because it's simply not realistic.
Based purely on Failla's own statements on the subject quoted in the complaint, do *you* think that he was unaware of how the funds were being used?  How do you think an average juror would vote on that point, or how a judge would view it?
Your arguments about the wording of the laws strike me similarly.  Laws are interpreted in the context of their intent, their prior application, and a shared understanding that the legal system has.  The situations in which someone says "but your honor, 18 USC 1960 does not reference 31 CFR 1010.100!" and the judge says "you know what, you're right, defendant is free to go!" are, for all practical purposes, limited to TV shows produced by Dick Wolf.  In practice, it doesn't matter, because the lawyers and judges understand the intent, and there's precedent to back that up.  
In this case, the intent is very clear: laws around money transfer, exchange, and laundering are there for a purpose, and that purpose is precisely to be able to lock up people like Shrem and Faiella who are facilitating drug trade, even if neither of them ever touched drugs themselves.  If those laws don't apply in this case, they would hardly ever apply to any case.


That's probably true, although the reason is that an attempt at a real legal challenge to this case would most likely end up with Shrem and Faella serving even longer jail sentences.

I'm not arguing that Nubits is a safe or perfect USD equivalent.  But under some circumstances, it may be viable to treat it as one, if you're willing to take the kinds of risks that are currently common in cryptocurrencies.  As long as the peg holds, its volatility is infinitely better than Bitcoin's, which is one of its major benefits.
I was really talking about the idea of a fiat equivalent cryptocoin in general, though, which has a lot of applications.


In that scenario, you would buy other cryptos with nubits on a decentralized exchange.
The point is that you can hold $1M of nubits in your own wallets, and transfer to/from an exchange using an ordinary crypto transaction, instead of a fiat currency transfer.  This is a potentially big benefit for people trading actively, especially if they work with multiple exchanges, or only trade a portion of their holdings at any time.  
If supported by multiple exchanges, you could also transfer Nubits directly between exchanges, something that currently typically requires either a two-stage fiat transfer, or taking exchange rate risk in some other crypto.
Currently, anyone holding dollars on a crypto exchange is relying on the exchange to maintain a dollar account for them.  Getting dollars in and out of that account requires fiat transfers to/from bank accounts.  It's this friction that something like Nubits removes, for any transactions that don't need to end up in a fiat account.
It also potentially (via something like multisig) allows owners to maintain some control over their own "dollar" accounts on exchanges, which eliminates much of the possibility of Goxxing at the exchange level.  This does more than just shift risk around, it allows products to be developed that are not themselves a source of significant additional risk.  
It's essentially unbundling the components of the exchange mechanism, which makes it easier for companies to specialize in what they're best at - you'd no longer have to trust exchanges as much as you do now.  You'd still have risk at the level of fiat equivalent cryptos, but the idea is that the organization that provides service at that level would require a higher level of auditing and trust than other organizations in the crypto value chain.
 


You still need somewhere that will exchange crypto for actual fiat currency in your bank account, but that's a separate issue.  This isn't something that would be useful to someone who just wants to buy a few bitcoin.  Rather, it's a mechanism at the infrastructure level which could help to build a more robust ecosystem.


I agree that the Nubit peg approach is dubious.  For true fiat equivalence it seems like you'd really need to hold full 1:1 reserves.

That's false.  The DNS was developed in the early 1980s, and was already well established by the time the web (HTTP protocol and web browsers) was invented in the early 1990s.  The only reason anyone ever used an IP address to access a web site was because the site owners chose not to set up DNS for it, which is still true today.
Before DNS was widely established, IP addresses were often used to access the older services that existed at the time, like FTP and Telnet.  Note that even Gopher, a protocol that was effectively killed by the web, was actually invented at around the same time as the web, and Gopher sites were routinely accessed via DNS names.
But even before DNS, [hosts files]( were used to map names to IP addresses.

The bit about banning encryption comes from Cameron's statements that he wants it to be possible to monitor any communication, if a warrant has been granted.  This raises the question of what they're going to do about encrypted communications.  An end-to-end encrypted communication that can't be covertly monitored even with a warrant would therefore presumably be in violation of this bill.

One difference is that money laundering requires effort to conceal the source of the funds.  Someone who had legally earned some money can just spend it, without indulging in any strange transactions in order to conceal its source.
The point being that the actions taken by criminals in this case differ from the action taken by non-criminals.  Anti-money laundering laws target the actions taken by criminals, not the actions taken by non-criminals.


The same basic response applies here.  Anti-money laundering isn't about targeting some activity that everyone performs, it's about targeting an activity that only criminals need to perform.

That's a false equivalence.  The NSA has been doing secret data collection, supported by secret courts, and the benefits of those efforts have yet to be demonstrated, even if they were somehow decided to be acceptable.  By contrast, money laundering laws and enforcement is a traditionally open legal mechanism, fairly uncontroversial in most political quarters, used in ordinary law enforcement, with success publicly documented by the cases that are brought and won every year, by law enforcement agencies around the world.


In the AML case, it's not a "false sense of security" given that it consistently results in successful prosecutions.  It's real security that ironically, is helping to provide you with the illusion that it isn't necessary to do anything to respond to the activities of malicious actors.


It's not that simple.  In the US, even undocumented immigrants can be banked, get loans, etc., even with a relatively "restrictive" financial system.  There are many causes for the large number of unbanked people - a lot of it has to do with level of education, distrust of banks, poor financial infrastructure in the most heavily affected countries, and so on.
The current system didn't arise from nowhere, it arose as a response to the needs of real people going about their lives and being forced to deal with the consequences of crime.  If digital currency usage expands dramatically, the same needs are going to arise in that context.  From the regulator's perspective, the ways to deal with this are already known, and digital currency is really not anything new from that perspective.


That output is not excluded, it goes through different channels.  Check cashing services, cash, etc.  And I don't doubt that in future, some of it will go through digital currencies.  But the regulatory efforts in the US aren't inhibiting that in any meaningful way.  


Lawmakers and voters.  Unlike the NSA case, these laws are not some sort of decision imposed from on high by an out of control government.  Just as one example of a group that works on these kinds of issues, look at the [Retail Payments Risk Forum](


That point was simply to refute your logically invalid implication that one alleged failure of enforcement meant that money laundering laws did not "actually work."


I see plenty of evidence that it does, yes.  I think the onus is on you to explain away the facts of successful money laundering prosecutions.
AML laws also helps to reduce ability of large criminal organizations to function effectively.  Groups like the Mafia were a plague in the US up until about the 1970s, and it was laws like these and the enforcement of them that helped eliminate that kind of activity.  Recall that the way they caught Al Capone (decades before that) was on tax evasion - that was a valuable lesson for law enforcement.
Ignoring the impact of malicious actors is unfortunately easy to do when you're doing it in an environment that goes to great lengths to neutralize those actors.  The "restrictive state of our financial system" is a response to a set of problems.  You're free to deny the existence of those problems, but no-one who's actually involved in dealing with these issues will take you seriously then.  If you want to help effect change, you have to be able to address specifics and propose realistic alternatives.  
To take an example, do you think selling stolen property should also not be a crime?  That seems to follow from your position on money laundering.
In business, there's a value chain in which different businesses cooperate in order to produce goods and services.  In criminal enterprises, there's also a value chain, for example:  (1) original crime, (2) monetization of proceeds from crime, (3) launder money, (4) use clean money to benefit from crime.
Selling stolen property is one instance of step 2.  If that's not considered criminal, then as soon as a criminal is able to exchange stolen property with someone who's willing to accept and sell it, they're free and clear.  The same logic applies to step 3.


As described above, money laundering laws don't only track criminal activity, they also help to prosecute members of the criminal value chain who otherwise would not be doing anything illegal.   Only the people in step 1 above can be caught with your approach, and it's more difficult to catch them.  
It becomes a lot less easy to catch the people in step 1 if all they have to do is find a good fence who's willing to keep their identity anonymous.  When the police come to the fence, the fence says "hey, even if it was stolen, selling stolen property's not a crime, I can't help you."  Same goes for a money launderer.  
To use your wording, "do you honestly believe" that someone who regularly takes criminally-obtained goods or money from someone else and take steps to hide its source should be immune to legal action?  If you answer "yes" to that question, I'd be curious to understand your perspective better.

Ethereum's main differentiating factor currently relies a bit too heavily on hype. Every Ethereum smart contract has to execute on every node in the network in order to maintain security and integrity. That limits the contract processing power of the entire network to that of a single node. 
That's OK if all you're doing is very simple, like what Bitcoin does - incrementing and decrementing balances in a computationally trivial way. But it doesn't support "smart" contracts at any kind of scale.
Many proponents seem to think this is just a technical problem that will be solved soon, and point to things like the attempts to introduce parallel processing of contracts on individual nodes. But that doesn't even begin to solve the problem described above, which is basically a research problem in the category described in [this xkcd]( - where "five years" is a euphemism for "we have no clue how long it'll take to find a viable solution."

I would prefer a less partisan source for the info you linked to, if you have one. It's a complex issue and it's easy to skew the results of an analysis, if one is so inclined.


First, a big part of my point is that the blame here lies as much with US businesses who exploit undocumented immigrant labor, and the consumers who benefit from that, as with the immigrants themselves. Those beneficiaries include you, by the way. Undocumented immigrants mean cheaper goods and services for you, which you have benefited from your entire life.
Second, you've made a conjecture about what would happen without that labor, but it almost certainly isn't true. "Competitive levels" includes "competitive with other sources of labor", including labor in other countries. What you're suggesting is more likely to make many American businesses less competitive, than to produce the result you're imagining.

And of course the more important reason is that there's only one way to prove that you're Satoshi - move some of the right coins. Until someone has done that, there's not much reason to take them seriously.
Finally, this behavior is very out of character, based on Satoshi's previous communications.

You're essentially changing the subject now. Here are the comments that started this discussion:






My point is that the first commenter's position is rational. If one has a choice of spending a deflationary currency vs. a neutral or inflationary one, the only rational choice is to spend the latter. As such, the entreaty "please don't think like that" is useless, arguing against not just *a* rational position, but the *only* rational position under the circumstances.
I further stated that this characteristic is a problem for a supposed currency. You're essentially making arguments in mitigation of that problem, you're not saying anything that contradicts its existence. 
But even those arguments are, like the person saying "Please don't think like that", simply arguing with reality. The reality is that most people will, quite rationally, avoid spending a deflationary currency, and tend to use alternatives instead. Because of this, your macroeconomic speculation about what a system might look like with only a deflationary currency is nothing more than a fantasy. It's not going to happen in the real world.


Sorry, but this is complete nonsense. Different asset classes have significantly different properties, and there's a cost associated with switching between classes. That cost is significant here - if switching between asset classes were free, then the optimal choices would be different.


"Can be", yes. But *should* they be? The same logic applies here: it doesn't make sense to sell appreciating bonds to pay for something if you have some other way to pay for it. There's also a cost associated with selling bonds, which you don't want to have to pay every time you need to spend money.
That's why rational economic actors keep some proportion of assets in different classes, and part of why the asset class distinction is economically relevant, and not "just a way to make language easier."


No, it's not the only difference. Another difference is that people are less inclined to spend. And that's a problem for a currency, in the sense that it will inhibit the use of the currency, and cause people to use alternatives.

No, because those currencies are all continually measured against various external measures, including other currencies. If a currency is overvalued or undervalued, it's corrected quite quickly, and a bubble is not sustainable. 
Bubbles usually form in markets which are more isolated, where external measurement of value and correction is more difficult. The housing bubble is a good example. 
Bitcoin suffers from the potential for bubbles because it's currently not obviously connected to real measures - it's difficult to determine what it "should be" worth.


I'll leave the "believing in" to religious people. People "believe in" US President Trump. The reason they do that is they're disconnected from facts and understanding.


Just saying it doesn't make it true. Bitcoin's current volatility undermines the idea that it's "sound", as does its lack of real-world backing of the kinds that national currencies naturally have due to having large populations and tax bases that are essentially required to use it. Bitcoin is basically in a similar position to Myspace - a first mover that's at risk of being replaced by a newcomer, especially one that addresses its various technical and usability shortcomings.
Counterparty risk is not a significant risk for major national currencies, so the benefit of Bitcoin there is somewhat abstract. 
Even censorship resistance is still a work in progress, since concentration of power among miners is a real risk.
"International" is somewhat meaningless, or at least would need to be qualified - many other currencies are effectively international.
In short, your slogan needs work.


This is a pipe dream. You seem to be looking for "something to believe in" that will somehow fix the world's ills. I'm afraid a cryptocurrency is not going to be it.

Because of anonymity, it's difficult to determine the types of transactions that appear on the blockchain, so e.g. distinguishing between a transfer between addresses in the same person's wallet, transfers to/from a Bitcoin exchange, and actual payments for goods and services is impossible in general. With heavy-duty analysis, it's possible to identify well-known addresses and get a somewhat skewed sampling using those as the roots of a graph of known activity.
For overall blockchain statistics, blockchain.info is a good starting point:
  
That has charts for things like number of transactions per day, recently ranging from 200k - 300k+. That includes all the types of activity mentioned above. 
One thing to note is that trades on most exchanges generally don't hit the blockchain - the exchange holds the coins, and keeping track of who owns how many coins. So only a small proportion of trading activity shows up in the blockchain - mainly transfers in and out of exchanges.
There are also measures like [Bitcoin Days Destroyed]( which attempts to filter out "churn" due to e.g. transfers between addresses that aren't actually purchases. It's not perfect but it gives some idea of real activity.

Stocks and bonds are not used as currency. "Savings" is not an asset class. I was responding to a person who wants Bitcoin to be used as a currency, who was responding to someone else who expressed reservations about spending Bitcoin because it's deflationary.


You seem to be missing some distinctions here. Different asset classes have different purposes. No-one's claiming that appreciating assets are a problem in general. However, a currency whose value consistently appreciates tends to discourage people from spending it, as earonesty's comment suggests. The desire to avoid spending it is a problem for something that's intended to be a currency.


That's really not the issue. The issue is that even if you need to buy something essential - say, food - it's not rational to buy it with a currency whose value increases significantly over time. You're better off using some other currency that doesn't have that property, otherwise you're basically throwing away money.

If everyone is mostly holding and hardly ever using it as a medium of exchange, then the demand for Bitcoin will be lower, and the price will drop accordingly - potentially to zero.
Why might you want to hold Bitcoin as opposed to some obscure altcoin? The reason boils down to the demand for Bitcoin being driven by actual use. 
Just holding doesn't count as a use. Holding alone relies on circular logic: "Bitcoin is valuable because lots of people are holding it, and lots of people are holding it because it's valuable." This is virtually the definition of a bubble, easily popped by a fad or a scare.
By contrast, if it's actually used as a medium of exchange, that creates a "natural" demand for it that won't easily go away, because that use requires systems, and systems are costly to change. 
But if people stop using Bitcoin, the systems in place to handle it will start to be abandoned. Demand for Bitcoin will drop, and more importantly, perception of the value and future stability of Bitcoin will drop, and the price will tend towards zero.

I like Bitcoin, but I don't share your belief. Bitcoin was the first decentralized cryptocurrency. It's got a long list of obvious flaws and challenges - technical, social, and political.

Why would everyone be holding in that situation, though? Everyone sane would be scrambling for the exits. You seem to have missed, or at least not properly addressed, an important part of my explanation:


As for your China example, the problem with using the current situation to try to reason about what would happen in a hodl-only environment is that it's counterfactual. There's too much other demand for Bitcoin, including speculative demand, for a single incident like that to cause a long term problem. It would be different if that other demand didn't exist. And if the only demand is speculative demand, that's a bubble.
You provide the following argument for Bitcoin's intrinsic utility:


However, the problem with that is that there are other cryptocurrencies with the same properties. If Bitcoin is used for nothing but a store of value, it will soon after be used for nothing at all.

First, rereading your original comment, I agree that my response doesn't meet your specification of "something else that is novel that is likely to happen." It's certainly not novel, as you say. The likelihood of happening is debatable, though, and that's what's important to people relying on Bitcoin.
I do understand network effects, but unlike, say, TCP/IP, a global cryptocurrency in widespread use - orders of magnitude larger than today - will have enormous political and competitive pressures on it. The events we've seen so far have had the benefit of playing out in a mostly enthusiast community, but things like the lack of traditional governance is likely to be a major sticking point for wider adoption.
If national governments create or adopt cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin - which seems likely to happen sooner or later - that could consign Bitcoin more permanently to a kind of niche status, with less interest in mainstream adoption than it has today.
Keep in mind that the total value of all Bitcoin today is about 0.3% of the market cap of the S&amp;P 500. It hasn't even begun to enter the mainstream as a currency, and that's likely to change the game significantly.
As for your other example, Facebook, don't forget the examples of MySpace, or Digg, or Slashdot. Facebook could die completely, especially if there was a paradigm shift like the one from desktop apps to the web. 
In cryptocurrencies, a much less significant technical change could make Bitcoin obsolete, although of course it's always possible that some sort of chain replacement could occur, carrying the Bitcoin name and value into a new technical form.


Absolutely, but it's the tech that's important. Bitcoin just happens to be the first mover, that did very well out of the gate.


But in many ways, that's where it faces some of the biggest challenges, both technical and political, some of which I touched on above.


If by "undo" you mean something like putting the cryptocurrency genie back in the bottle, I agree with you. I was just talking about how Bitcoin might be replaced. I think that there's a reasonable chance that it could have a lifecycle that's relatively short. Anyone who's significantly economically involved with it might want to keep that in mind.
E.g. TCP/IP is 40+ years old, which is millennia in cryptocurrency years. There's enormous interest in blockchain tech at the moment, with all sorts of companies thinking about ways to make money from the tech, not specifically from Bitcoin. 
The developments over the next couple of decades are likely to make Bitcoin look a bit like the Model T Ford - another first mover that did fantastically well, "the most influential car of the 20th century," but because of technological progress, its lifespan was 19 years.


I agree. I'm trying to be realistic.

There's no such thing as a price that it "should" be. 
The price depends on two main factors: (1) fundamentally, the size and underlying wealth of the market that's using it, i.e. the value of the goods and services being purchased with it; and (2) speculatively, the number of people who believe in the future of Bitcoin enough to buy and hold it for some period in an attempt to profit. 
Both of those factors change over time, and the value of a Bitcoin changes accordingly. The same goes for other currencies, too.

I'm not in the "Bitcoin is a bubble" camp, but my imagination is up to your challenge. All it would take is a new cryptocurrency with sufficiently significant advantages over Bitcoin to appear and become popular quickly. 
There are several scenarios in that case, but one of them is a rapid switch out of Bitcoin partly driven by fear of the impact on Bitcoin. In that case, a massive break with Bitcoin's price cycles would occur, Bitcoin would turn into one of the cheap altcoins, and would eventually be mainly of historical interest.
To be clear, it's probably more likely that such a switch would happen gradually, without a single unrecoverable crash, but the point is that obvious terminal crash scenarios do exist.

Many business founders are that way. I worked for three years at a startup whose founders had that attitude. I would call both of them great guys.
A lot of the complaining about this kind of thing comes from people who are bad with boundaries. They treat their employers as authority figures, a kind of personal way of relating to them that goes well beyond any employer/employee contract. As a result, they seek approval in forms other than monetary compensation, and are very sensitive to pressure about things like working hours. They don't negotiate their working conditions, they accept them, and instead of proactively addressing them, they complain to anyone who'll listen. Outside of extreme cases, it's basically meaningless. Complainers gonna complain.


"Expect" is a key factor here. "Expecting" in business would be little more effective than wishing, if it weren't for how sensitive many people are to those expectations. From one perspective, you could say that business management exploits people's weaknesses in these areas for their profit. And they do. But from another perspective, the management of big businesses are running organizations that keep tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of people employed. That takes hard decisions that often are literally incomprehensible to the people whose understanding of business is limited to showing up regularly, doing their work, and getting paid perfectly regularly. They treat that deal as a kind of law of the universe, but it only works as long as business owners are making hard decisions about their lives that they often don't understand.
One factor in all of this is that the US is not a particularly friendly country to employees. Labor laws are nowhere near as protective of employees as they are in most western European countries, for example. This means that companies are able to demand more from their employees, and that becomes part of the competitive environment that businesses have to respond to. If you want to build a new, large business that competes with other large businesses, particularly in areas like cars and spaceflight which are basically oligopolies, you have to compete on a level that's consistent with the environment. If SpaceX and Tesla treated its employees the way some large, mature, established businesses do, they would fail.
So the choice is basically along the lines of "should companies like Tesla and SpaceX exist?" If you don't think they should, then you're basically saying that the status quo should remain as is, with oligopolies consisting of companies like Ford and GM, Boeing and Lockheed Martin, that are not advancing their field very much, particularly if no-one else is forcing them to. But if you answer yes, then you have to recognize that working at those disruptive companies will not be a cakewalk. It's the nature of the beast. Putting it personally on the founders is misguided.

Why? Because the same forces that caused the bubble to inflate in the first place works in both directions. The price in these situations rises when the positive feedback loop of new investors being attracted by the rising prices inflates the price further, attracting more investors. But exactly the same thing happens in reverse - a negative feedback loop - when the price is falling. 
There isn't an endless pool of buyers or money. At some point, the amount of money available for investment dries up. At that point, the bubble is no longer inflating. But what's keeping it inflated? The answer is, not much, if anything. And that means a dip can easily turn into a correction or crash - the price dips, some people decide to get out, negative feedback begins, and you have a crash.
In the absence of some fundamental reason for a price increase - e.g. a profitable company underlying a stock - it's inevitable that sharp increases will be followed by sharp drops. 
In the Bitcoin case, there are essentially no fundamentals - the price is not based on its use as a currency, but rather on the demand as a speculative investment vehicle. That's the main reason its price is so volatile. If it was really being widely used as a currency, the volatility would be damped out due to actual demand for the currency.


It has been studied and written about extensively, to the point that there are common quotes and phrases about it:  "what goes up must come down," Warren Buffett's "be fearful when others are greedy," as well as the terms "correction", "bubble", and "greater fool theory."


You're confusing two different things: it's impossible to predict when it's going to hit the top. However, *after* such a steep rise, when the price begins to drop, there's a high likelihood that it's going to drop a lot. And in fact the drop itself proves that a *lot* of people "predicted" exactly that - they were selling because they were worried it was going to drop further. If you want to protect your gains, you take profits. That's how investing works.

That wouldn't be much of an issue if it actually sees much wider use as a currency. I.e., since supply is fixed, it's all about demand, and an active currency has demand. I wouldn't expect to see a crash due to speculators exiting in that case - it wouldn't happen all at once, and you probably wouldn't even be able to detect the effect without sophisticated modeling.
But if it remains a niche currency with a high value mainly due to speculator demand, then yes, it could crash hard at some point.

Backing with silver or gold is almost meaningless, other than an irrational comfort factor that it gives people who don't understand how currency works.
The value of a currency is based not on what the notes are physically made of, but on the wealth that it represents. When you use a physical commodity to back a currency, all it means is that the price of the commodity will inflate far beyond any intrinsic value it has, to match all the wealth it represents. That premium 
depends on the economy that's using the currency, and it can disappear just as easily, no matter what physical representation the currency has - gold, silver, paper, or digital data.

Krugman's ideological commitment is partly to the concept of a central bank which manages a currency's supply, and partly to the broader concept of a central government that manages a society's behavior.
The fact that he has some rational economic justifications for that commitment doesn't change the ideological aspect: he's unwilling to consider that alternative approaches might be viable. As such, his writing on this topic is not that of an objective observer - he's picked a side and argues to support that side. That's ideological.


That is indeed part of what appears to underlie Krugman's support for fiat currencies. His politics are very much of the big-central-government liberal type.
The hyperbole of his that you quoted reflects the emotional investment he has in defending the status quo that he believes in.

Re people who "quit or hate it there", that's to be expected at companies like that. They're in the process of disrupting some of the largest oligopolies in American business - cars and aerospace. You can't do that by running a company as though it were a mature, established business. I've addressed that further in [this comment](


Can you name a big company that publicly credits its employees? That's not how it generally works.


How many people would you say are in the same group as him? I think 1,000 would be pushing it - there aren't 1,000 people in the US with that kind of achievement record. If you pick 1,000, that puts him in the top 0.0003% within the US.
If you go by net worth, he's  on Forbes' global list of billionaires. That puts him in the top 0.000001%, worldwide.


What does that even mean? He founded Tesla in 2003, so has been there for nearly 15 years.


No-one accused him of running a charity.


What are you talking about? He founded the Boring Company and is in the process of getting into that business. Do you want him to wave a magic wand? 
In the real world, the way you wave that wand is by starting companies and finding employees who are willing to work hard to help change the world. You can't have it both ways. It takes time, like the 15+ years that both Tesla and SpaceX have been in business.

The stupidity doesn't have to involve an inability to distinguish right from wrong. It could just be doing something which, with corrupt intent, would be illegal, but without that intent, would just be stupid because it *looks* illegal.
In white collar crime cases that revolve around intent, it's not unusual for people to walk free if corrupt intent can't be proven.
An example is insider trading - insiders who sell shares of a company right before it tanks are not guilty of a crime, unless it can be proven that they sold because they were aware of reasons to believe the price was about to drop.
Someone who sold shares for some unrelated reason, at a time when they were aware that the share price might soon be dropping, may be able to prove that their intent was not corrupt, even if their timing was stupid in the sense of looking suspicious.

That's not what I wrote. I was referring specifically to Krugman's opinions on the matter, which he has written about at length over the years. His NYT column is described as being about "macroeconomics, trade, health care, social policy and politics."

They're used to most people following the ordinary model of progressing through education into the workforce and, in only a few cases, achieving anything worth noting later in that process.

People like Krugman are ideologically committed to fiat. [Here's his latest article about it](
A lot of ordinary people have a similar, if less well-informed, perspective. They see fiat as "real money", and Bitcoin as less real and thus not worth considering using it. This is an ideologically-based perspective.
There's *some* merit to the argument - Krugman touches on it when he says this:


Bitcoin currently lacks the kinds of barriers to exit that fiat currencies have, which makes it risky and volatile. It also lacks market-sensitive supply management. Someone who dismisses Bitcoin because of these kinds of issues is exhibiting a kind of ideological commitment to fiat.

It's almost certainly isn't going to be The Last Crytpocurrency, but I don't really know why that's important. Everything has a lifecycle.
I guess what many people are looking for is what they perceive as the stability of a major fiat currency. For example, the US dollar has been around for 225 years, which isn't really that long, but it's about three human lifetimes, which makes it seem stable and durable from a subjective individual perspective. (Interesting to note that Bitcoin has existed for nearly 5% of that time!)
There's a good chance Bitcoin itself won't last centuries, though, so for people who are looking for something they feel is safe and durable over a long period, Bitcoin is not it. There's some validity to that perspective - Bitcoin is currently potentially subject to replacement in a way that most fiat currencies aren't, and replacement will be financially painful for many people. A naive way of characterizing this is to say that Bitcoin is a bubble.

The blockchain provides trust in certain properties of a transaction. It's only trustless in the sense that you don't have to rely on individuals or individual corporations to validate a transaction - instead, the blockchain provides that trust. So "trustless" here just means that the locus of trust is distributed and difficult to attack - in that sense, the blockchain is a "trust platform".
"Trustless" can also be misleading: if I pay an online vendor for some product or service, I'm still trusting the vendor to provide that product or service. 
The only sense in which trust changes in an ordinary Bitcoin transaction is that neither party can get away with fraudulent claims about whether they've made/received payment. This can be an improvement over banks, which can make resolving disputes difficult in some cases since there tend to be at least two banks involved in a transaction, each of which enforces privacy on their customer's transactions.
More sophisticated use of blockchains can provide similar trust features to other aspects of transactions - particularly with products or services that can be transferred digitally, in which case it's often possible for blockchain to provide trust on the entire transaction.

Focusing on the price of Bitcoin isn't very meaningful without considering other factors.
There've been many people who have bought, held, and traded Bitcoin with the expectation that its use is going to explode soon and that the price will rise significantly as a result. This has led to large overvaluations relative to other measures of its value.  Since its use hasn't exploded to the extent they expected, the overvaluation hasn't been sustainable and the price has been steadily declining as the patience of the moon-seekers is tested.
However, the fact that the number of transactions has been consistently and steadily rising over a period of more than five years - which is clearly reflected in the most recent year, shown on the second chart on the page you linked - can't reasonably be described as a "downtrend" for Bitcoin in general.

Actually I would say the situation is worse. A set of decisions has been made, true, but there are going to be other decisions that need to be made in future, and there's no reasonable mechanism for making them.  
As Bitcoin scales, the software needs to evolve, and if usage of Bitcoin becomes large enough, people in general, outside of current Bitcoin fans, aren't going to be happy with leaving those decisions to a self-selected group of software developers and their funders.

A typical definition of "government" is "the governing body of a nation, state, or community."  Every corporation has a government, as does every nation, state, town, charity, or any large group of people.

Ok, take away corporations and governments. At some point, in the ensuing chaos, you'll get groups of people banding together for a common purpose. They will find, as every such group of humans have ever found before them, that in order to make decisions what the group should do, it helps to have rules to "govern" the behavior of the group, so that the group doesn't keep having to revisit the same issues over and over every time they have a disagreement.
Given such rules, there needs to be some way to "enforce" the rules, otherwise they're meaningless. This can range anywhere from censure of members to expulsion from the group.
Some of the most effective groups will also find that a very effective way to operate a group is to have one or more smaller groups who pays their full attention to the operation of the group - helping to make decisions for the group, according to the rules.  
In fact, they'll find that having multiple such smaller groups is useful - a group to deal with finances (let's call it the finance committee), a group to deal with the day to day decisions on behalf of the group (an executive committee), a group to deal with ongoing changes to the rules (a rules committee), a group to deal with members' concerns and new members (a membership committee), a group to deal with other groups (an external relations committee), and so on.
Groups that are well-organized along these lines will find they have a big advantage over less well organized groups - better able to compete no matter what the field of competition happens to be - trade, war, whatever.  In a "free market" of such groups, the best governed groups will win.
The end result: governments everywhere.

Because money represents the wealth of a society. If there's a fixed amount of it, then the value of money necessarily increases over time. 
This sounds like it might be fine, but it actually isn't. It's classic deflation, which leads to various well known problems, a primary one being that people tend to hoard currency, expecting it to go up in value. This has various negative effects on an economy, since it inhibits spending and other kinds of investment.
One of the functions good central banks perform is to make sure that both inflation and deflation are kept under control. Too much movement in either direction tend to have negative effects. With a fixed currency supply, there's no way to do that.

Some of the differences are:
1. You can keep your balance in Bitcoin. BTC is converted to fiat automatically at time of payment by Shift/Coinbase. 
2. You can fund the card by transferring Bitcoin directly to it, with no exchange fees.
3. You can transfer BTC directly out of your card's balance (i.e. out of your Coinbase account), again with no exchange fees.
In short, it gives you a way to directly spend Bitcoin anywhere that Visa is accepted. It's a good option for Bitcoin to have.

Right, but I was responding to "especially now that dollars are not backed by gold."
BTW, I would argue that the idea that gold-backed currencies have merit is a myth that the creator of Bitcoin bought into, by choosing to limit the supply of Bitcoin and create an ultimately deflationary currency. It makes more sense both economically and intuitively for money supply to be able to grow in a way that's correlated to the wealth of the society that uses it.

That's not quite correct. Coinbase users may certainly hold bitcoin, it's just that they sometimes hand control over that bitcoin to Coinbase.  One reason they might do that is in order to be able to spend their bitcoin at any merchant that takes Visa cards.


Not sure what you're referring to - could you be more specific?
Some have suggested that this card is no different than e.g. a Paypal debit card, but it is different in the sense that you can use it to spend Bitcoin directly, you can fund the card with Bitcoin, and you can withdraw money from it (i.e. from your Coinbase account) using Bitcoin. It allows you to remain in Bitcoin only until you actually spend something with a merchant that doesn't accept Bitcoin.
It's a potentially useful service for anyone who's serious about using Bitcoin, and as others have said without services that bridge these gaps, Bitcoin won't get anywhere.

Arguably, governance is worse. While it's similar in that it's centralized in the hands of a small number of people, the way in which those people are selected is not designed to optimize for ability to govern a currency, and decisions are being made based on criteria and beliefs which, in any more formal organization, would be rejected early on.
That's not to say the traditional central bank model is perfect - far from it! - but the "developers rule" model (in conjunction with "miners accept") is likely to be significantly worse. We're only just starting to see the results of that in practice.
It will be interesting to see how the traditional banks interested in Bitcoin try to address this. You can bet none of them is happy about the idea of betting billions or trillions of dollars on an ad-hoc governance system in which they have no direct representation.

It's transferred from one address in the ledger to another - just like currency in a bank account. The usual way we talk about that is "transferring money (currency)". When you pay someone with Bitcoin, you are transferring Bitcoin to that person. If you want to be pedantic, you can add "...to an address controlled by that person", but this doesn't actually add to or change the meaning.


Just as with other currencies.


Which makes it a currency: "a medium of exchange for goods and services."

What makes something inherently valuable?  Your desert example illustrates the problem with this, because there are lots of things that would be useless to you when stranded in a desert, which would have value in other contexts.  Different people value different things, and give different value to the same things. So value can depend on context, and on who's doing the valuing, i.e. who's "giving value."
When you divide things as you did above, into things with "real value" and those that don't have "actual value", you're making a kind of circular argument - until you've more clearly defined what "real value" is, the reason for the division is because you've defined it that way.
Your idea of real value seems related to what economists call [utility]( As the latter link says:

What implications do you think this has? To me, it's just another example of ad-hoc governance that's unlikely to be considered acceptable in any widespread adoption scenario.
The article I linked has quotes by a few people other than just Mike. My point is that with those kinds of concerns, a proposal like this wouldn't be likely to get through a traditional governance approach, without at least attempting to address the concerns.
With a currency that's widely adopted, conservatism regarding changes, especially controversial ones, is generally seen as a positive trait. Bitcoin is still functioning as a kind of working experiment. People and businesses who understand this are not going to want to be significantly exposed to the experimental risk that it entails.
The bottom line, coming back to a point that made, is that politics is about as important, if not more so, than technology for the long-term success of a currency. We don't normally see this very explicitly because currencies have been so closely associated with national governments, and so currency management is subsumed into national political processes. Removing national governments from the picture exposes the political element more openly.
Bitcoin has some good answers on the techological side, but weak answers for the political side. Even attempting to address known weaknesses on the techological side is exposing the political weaknesses.
Edit: I should clarify that I don't think what's happening currently is necessarily "wrong" or anything like that. Rather, it's that Bitcoin-as-experiment and Bitcoin-as-truly-widespread-currency are not likely to be compatible, and the idea that the former will evolve into the latter is at best an optimistic hope. If widespread adoption is an actual goal, then attention will need to be paid to the governance side of things, one way or another.

If you think that's important, you don't understand currency. 
Any currency is "backed" by what you can exchange it for. Saying a currency is backed by gold essentially just says that you're using gold as currency, with proxies for it in the form of paper money. In that case, the value of gold will rise to represent the value of the entire economy that uses it. The "intrinsic" value of gold is irrelevant in that scenario, so you haven't gained anything by using gold, other than a deflationary currency.

You can't really call Bitcoin a "payment system" if it's not also a currency. Credits cards are payment systems, Paypal is a payment system. Both allow you to transfer currency between parties. The only thing Bitcoin allows you to transfer between parties is Bitcoin - so if it's a payment system, then it's also a currency.

You don't need a remittance company to do that conversion, though.  I send money to family members, and I just asked them to set up an account on a local Bitcoin exchange.

There's a parallel here to "technological issues which got solved," though.  Issues in financial systems may not get *solved* exactly, but like the Internet, the systems are dynamic - people respond and change things when signs of failure become too hard to ignore.

But before catastrophic failure occurs, things usually get changed.  It's like a toddler learning to walk - he falls forward and sometimes manages to put his foot out just in time to prevent a fall.

That depends.  An interesting feature of Bitcoin is that it can move across continents instantly and with no traditional middleman.  This has various advantages when you look at it at a systemic level.  
With Western Union, a local franchise requires a relationship with a single company, Western Union, and that relationship involves a more significant commitment - legally, branding-wise, and paperwork-wise - than simply setting up to send and receive BTC.  It's very likely that in future, you'll be able to exchange BTC (or whatever ends up replacing it) in many more places than WU could ever hope to have.  You can already buy some goods and services directly with BTC, which is something WU can't even contemplate.


It's not a hobby for me.  The only reason I'm using Bitcoin currently is to send money to my mom.

If you're interested in understanding how it's possible to be so sure of this, read up on special relativity, which is actually one of the simplest theories in physics, other than classical mechanics, and can be worked for yourself out just by knowing one fact - that the speed of light is constant in all reference frames - and some basic geometry.

In both cases, Krugman is just exhibiting a lack of imagination of how big an impact disruptive technologies tend to have.
The real problem here is that his position is incoherent. He's simply throwing objections at the wall and hoping some will stick, he's not at all addressing the underlying forces. It's as if he hasn't really thought about it in any depth, just reacted on a knee-jerk basis.  He's not actually making an argument that Bitcoin can't succeed, he's trying to argue that it shouldn't succeed, because it violates his political and economic preferences. 
That's the reason his arguments are incoherent  - he's not arguing his actual objections, he's just looking for anything he can use to damage something he perceives as a threat. It's classic conservative behavior.

Except he didn't say uptake would be slow, he said that the Internet was a fad. He went on to say that the demand for IT personnel would drop and that the idea of an information economy would fail. He couldn't have been more wrong, on all counts.


Agreed. And it's this sort of more fundamental perspective that I would expect an allegedly world-class economist to be covering. 
The point about the politics of the backers is pretty irrelevant, I think, unless a digital currency comes along that is somehow more acceptable to those looking  for more centralized control.  That seems unlikely, because such systems are likely to suffer from the exact problems that cryptocurrency addresses.  The advantages as a distributed digital currency network grows will make the choice to use it a simple pragmatic one, just as people still use cash today, even though drug dealers also like to use cash.


"Frequently accurate" probably needs to be better qualified. With his history on technolgical subjects, and the specifics of his position on Bitcoin, I'm not sure his commentary in this case is worthy of much more than a meme in response. He's being mocked because his position is eminently mockable.

The so-called "whiners" will have a bigger and more constructive impact on the future than you. These are systems in the earliest stages of development. Entrepreneurs will speculate about what customers will accept, and put out a product based on that speculation. Customers will find pain points and complain. Companies will respond to those complaints, or not, and the market will find some sort of equilibrium between the conflicting desires of its participants.
In this case, we're talking about localbitcoin, which has a fairly unique model. It's not as simple as regulated vs. unregulated as a binary property - the specifics of the business model are a big aspect. Compare to Coinbase or Mt Gox, each of which has a different model and different weaknesses as a result.  
Even the thieves are helping to shape the market here - if they become too much of a problem, products will have to adapt or die. The alleged whiners are communicating about the state of the market and contributing to the conversation that will shape the future.
