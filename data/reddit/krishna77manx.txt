That's what I did. I'll give them credit for being communicative about it, but sadly too sketch for my comfort. Did they tell you that they'd moved offices from the UK to Romania Saturday night?
 
Tried ecurrencyzone, order completed, but they never contacted me to setup transfer.
 
Tried localbitcoins, but it's been 24 hours with no response. Going to try one other seller there and then figure something else out. 
 
Let me know if you find a good route to moneygram friendly, anonymous bitcoin purchases.

Seeming pretty scammy to me. I bought two BTC from Coinmama as a test last Wednesday. Their web page directed me to send a MoneyGram to Laurence Newman in the _UK_, so I did. Friday, I got an email asking me to send the money to Laurence Newman in _Romania_. I expressed concern over the location switch, given Romania's high rank as a source of internet swindles. They then offered that I could send the payment to Laurence Newman in Israel, a country also highly ranked as a source of internet swindles. 
Between the bait and switch on countries and Laurence Newman's magic ability to accept coins in person in Romania or Israel (but not the UK!), the whole operation seems pretty sketch. I'll give them through end of day Monday and will post an update here confirming that Coinmama is a scam or to apologize that I misjudged and they delivered services as advertised in way that doesn't involve walking down the internet equivalent of a dark alley in the bad part of town.
 
It's annoying that since bitinstant's implosion, there's no good, safe way to anonymously purchase BTC via cash/MoneyGram. I'll either buy a burner phone to register with bitinstant or give localbitcoin a go.
