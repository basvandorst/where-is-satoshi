Is there any reason you know of why volume went crazy ?
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:43:43
Awesome insight thanks!! 
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:31:54
Wutttt? It’s up 1% from 24 hrs ago and been one of the more stable days in a while. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:34:34
Weekend dips made sense given the uncertainty, now that everyone sees nothing is going to happen they're buying back in haaaa.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:44:29
It was pretty settled the last hour but looks like it's fueling up for another wild ride now lol.
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:11:13
It’s a Christmas miracle! 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:27:37
This wont be slowing down till the new year mark my words. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:22:01
I have noticed when Gemini &amp; Bitstamp are leading the price up we'll go on a bit of a run. Happening currently :) 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:46:16
Wake up Korea and let's keep goin'!!

Price prediction of who the fuck knows... today has been nuts.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:25:22
When I start to panic and then realize we're still up 16% from 24 hours ago LOL.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:58:56
14? You been asleep? That was ages ago. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:13:41
Once these markets get back up this is going to shoot past $20k+...
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:31:01
The swings today, markets crashing, etc are giving me an ulcer, holy shit.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:21:06
Dang huge spike on GDAX , over $17,000 again.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:47:59
“Correction is at 10k” “correction is at 12k” “correction is at 15k” people have been saying this for every thousand. Nobody knows if there’ll be one and when. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:43:30
Bitcoin up 16% on the hour... 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:43:31
Korea waking up in a couple hours, hold onto your butts.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:08:10
Agreed - I think they'll try some funny business but probably not for a bit. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:11:41
Lol BTC gonna wipe away the losses. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:06:03
Guessing that word got leaked from inside coinbase that they would start accepting bitcoin cash as their next crypto. People in the know likely dumped their bitcoin and then bought in when bitcoin cash went live (and promptly crashed.) Trading resumes tomorrow at 9 AM for BTH and don’t be surprised if people dump cash and bitcoin value surges. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:39:52
Not sure but you might wanna buy now. I think there's more likely a chance of it going up tomorrow now that it dipped a bit.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:22:22
Bitcoin is not for risk averse, this is pretty stressful... 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:21:16
A year ago people were complaining alt coins would cannibalize Bitcoin haha. If there’s only one winner so be it. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:18:59
This creeping growth really wets my whistle.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:49:17
All I know... it's gonna be a wild roller coaster buddy. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:54:06
Maybe but not till after futures trading starts
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:47:17
?? You pay on the gains. So yes you would if you sold. Or HOTL and not pay any taxes. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:52:48
Or every single Deus Ex Machina in The Last Jedi lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:50:12
It just broke through!! 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:52:02
Which drop? If you mean today, the markets (Gemini &amp; GDAX/Coinbase) crashed when the value hit $19k. I think that was a big reason why.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:19:08
HAH - I think they took that economist quote directly from a CNBC article...?
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:55:11
That’s not going to be the day shit goes down. If anything Wall Street will want it to keep rising for a while before they try to pull shit. But if normal every day investors and Korea keep buying it might not move the needle that much. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:56:51
Look up short term capital gains taxes. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:46:41
White Walker that shit
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:36:48
Weird how the weekend rolls around and it start sky rocketing. Wondering if the price was intentionally kept down all week based on seeing some of those sell walls. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:59:37
24 hour markets, wild volatility.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:50:18
[Breaking through 16.5k like...](
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:34:06
I'm gonna vomit. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:57:59
Yes, determine the cost you spent on BTC, then determine the current price and multiply it by your current amount of BTC. The difference would be your net profit.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:17:11
The reassuring thing to me is that it stabilized back at 15k. I was worried it would dip below 10k and it didn’t. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:17:55
$$ amount and number of people flowing in is insane. People are like herds of cattle and follow. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:47:39
Who knows, after the last few days.... hopefully to 18-19k again.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:52:28
Fake out!
