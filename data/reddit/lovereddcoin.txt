thank you. yes i researched coin dancing which made me think that Bitcoin, BTC and BSV were the main 3 Bitcoin and i see the stats of use.
i can see you people here are very one minded which is a good thing as it show support for bitcoin. I was not expect anyone to tell me not to buy bitcoin here!
just from other experience the people seem to be hitting me with many replies and somoone sent me $0.10 of bitcoin cash which was fun but i dont know what use yet and seem like a dead town. 
here it seem like people are more serious.

i always hear about bsv as fraud so it does not surprise. what suprise me today was find is ran by bitcoin cash and is try to make fraud against bsv! to be honest right now all i am thinking is not to trust any bitcoin.
i like your answers here you are very direct telling me that only bitcoin is bitcoin. and also i got warned that people from bch or bsv try to send me little money like to try to make me fall for trap of them!

no i try not to be so stupid to get burned. I know that i can buy part of a btc. But I remember from my old coin days it is nice to see higher number of coins. but yes I hope you see I am not the best at investing or crypto but i try to ask questions from many community to try and find the best answer for me. thank you for your time and concern to me.

yeah the balance investment strategy. do you think maybe any other coin with long history like monero litecoin or dash?
