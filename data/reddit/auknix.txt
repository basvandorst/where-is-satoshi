Traitor to who exactly ? Most people in the world do not have any sort of allegiance to America.  An Assange supporter in China may be considered a patriot.

In a free market, theft and fraud has less definition.  For example, the brute force decryption of keys going on right now against bitcoin wallets.  The owners of those wallets probably consider this theft, while the attackers probably consider it a necessary free market test of security.

You can't have a currency that is beyond laws and government and country and then have a valid complaint when law-less and morality-less practices are used.  It's one or the other.  In the true free market on a global scale, there is no theft, only comparisons of force.

You can, but that's not human nature.  Which is why, in theory, governments and regulations exist for things like currency and property and intellectual property.

Isn't this the fundamentals of a free market ?

At first I thought this was a reference to people buying children from pizza parlour basements using bitcoin.

This is why I toss everything below a quarter out the window like the trash it is.

Please tell parliament the truth.  It's a huge waste of energy and almost useless as a currency.

All these agencies want to kill bitcoin about as much as they want to kill PayPal.  In other words, they don't.  What they do want is to keep their citizens from filing bankruptcy due to stupid "investment" decisions.

That's a really big effortpost to defend child porn.

Yes.  That's how you convince people, by being the comic book guy from the Simpsons.

No that was in 1996 and it was during some programming class in highschool.  While I look back and laugh because "idiot 16 year old", it's not something I'd probably want to drag with me through life.

Because convincing people of a concept doesn't work if you're being condescending or coming up with weak strawman argument.  Also, when dealing with politicians and lawmakers, you don't answer questions with questions.

When I was 16 I wrote a Pascal screen saver that bounced a swastika around on the screen and made a fart noise every time it hit the edge.
