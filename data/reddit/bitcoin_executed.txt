Haha.. Oh boy, this has got to be satire
@_date: 2014-03-16 02:33:09


Gonna need some proof its you brah
Then again, you're only presenting your arguments, so we can take them on their own merits
You say that Bitcoin can't be classed as a good because its not tangible property.
I don't know what is the case, but I'd be interested to hear your thoughts - one counter example I thought of is MP3 downloads, which would seem to be equally intangible. Is GST charged on those? I would assume so, but as I say I haven't investigated.
Also what is your thoughts on my inference that effectively 20% tax will be paid, or that there will be a double GST (one on the goods paid for in BTC, and then again on the BTC when converted to fiat)?
@_date: 2014-03-16 01:47:14
10% when you pay with Bitcoin for the goods
Then an additional 10% when you convert the BTC to cash, since BTC is treated as a good as well
That's effectively 20%

This is proof that anything 'negative' gets downvoted - even if its real and important news
@_date: 2014-03-15 21:59:33
Yes, EVERY transaction of BTC is going to be taxed
Quote from the article:
'As to whether transferring Bitcoins to another party would be subject to Goods and Services Tax (GST), the answer was also a one-word "Yes."'
Youre living in denial bro
Its over for legal bitcoin use in australia

Source is Coindesk or ATO itself
Can't link at the moment, but search for 'ATO Bitcoin' in Google
@_date: 2014-03-16 01:54:36
What are you not getting exactly?
A person buys a sofa from a business for 1BTC. This gets assessed in terms of barter credits, and 10% is taxed.
Then when the business converts the Bitcoin to fiat (perhaps to buy more stock to sell) then they pay 10% again.
They are seperate from each other, but in the end the business has to pay 20% total. It passes the first round of GST on to the customer, but on the conversion to fiat it has to take a loss of 10%.
@_date: 2014-03-16 03:14:32
Would MP3s come under goods or 'rights', or both?
You seem to suggest that Australian businesses could get out of paying the GST if they sell the Bitcoins overseas. Would this open up any other cans of worms in your opinion?
What do you think the ATO will do on the matter of Bitcoin, and do you have any exclusive insights into how people involved in the government procedures might view it or treat it? I.e. do they want to stop it, regulate it or support it?
@_date: 2014-03-16 00:53:35
10% charged on the goods bought/bartered with BTC, and then an additional 10% charged on the BTC itself (since BTC is also treated as a good)
Total: 20% tax
@_date: 2014-03-15 23:54:28
Search in Google 'Is GST paid on Barter' and click the first link which is the response from the ATO themselves
You wouldn't pay the 10% on purchase, but the business does. If you sell Bitcoin though, you would pay the GST.
So if a business accepts Bitcoin, they pay 10% on the goods sold and then 10% on the Bitcoins they sell for fiat
@_date: 2014-03-16 01:39:43
1. 10% is paid by the business when goods are bought with BTC. Then when the BTC is converted to fiat, an ADDITIONAL 10% is paid, making it 20% total and unlike currency. Bitcoin is being treated as a good and not currency.
2. My mistake for the poor wording which was too ambiguous for your mind, I meant to say you will pay at least 50% tax on your capital gains. Its 100% if you make the capital gains within the first year. So say you bought 500BTC at $85 each 5 months ago ($42,500) and you sold those Bitcoins for $1200 each two months later, you would pay $252,000 in tax (42%).
Also Bitcoin isnt a 'principle place of residence' so that's irrelevant lol

I've provided the source - Coindesk and the ATO itself, just search on Google 'ATO Bitcoin', its the first result
I post on throwaway because I know negative news gets furiously downvoted
@_date: 2014-03-16 03:50:27
They said 'transfer' not 'purchase', which is highly suggestive that the mere changing hands of Bitcoins will incur GST
As to the courts being the final authority on the matter, which business is going to put themselves on the line on the bet that the ATO is wrong in their intepretation of the law? The point here is that businesses will be severely discouraged from accepting Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-16 01:07:12
Read the article first before commenting bro
ATO is treating Bitcoin as a good and not as a currency, and that's why its being double taxed at 20%
You can disagree with that all you want - fact of the matter is, they carry legal authority and force, and the vast majority of businesses would rather comply with the law rather than being shut down and/or being charged for tax evasion
If you think the 'black market' is going to become 'HUGE', then why doesn't almost every Australian business currently evade tax? Protip: Because they can't. And if youthink that a non-local black market is somehow possible, then keep in mind they they monitor all kinds of financial accounts and assets. Remember, under Australian law the onus is on you to prove your innocence, not the other way round. If you don't have records to back up your excuses when they come asking, you're fucked.
@_date: 2014-03-15 22:42:23
If a business tries to sell a sofa to a person, they will charge the GST
There would be no GST if its an individual private transaction like the one you describe. You would have to pay CGT if you make a profit though (50% tax on profits)
What you have to keep in mind though is that in order to get Bitcoins in Australia, you have to use a service like Coinjar. They would have to pay GST, and so they would have to charge that from you. The same is with all other businesses - so if a business accepts Bitcoin, they have to charge 10% on any sale of their Bitcoins.
And if you can't handle the heat, that's your problem bro
Sorry to be the one who brings reality to your isolated mind, but the truth is that people get raped and butchered every day - being 'offended' should be the least of your concerns, especially when you consider that when such expression is silenced, there is often a resort to physical expression of violence. To dismiss or otherwise ignore this innate aspect of the human being is foolish, dangerous and worthy of mockery. Further, allowance of 'offence' is essential to permit free expression - for a further explanation of why offense should be permitted and why free expression is valuable, I suggest you read John Stuart Mill's 'On Liberty' (a serious recommendation if you have not read it)
@_date: 2014-03-16 02:20:22


This is one of the stupidest comments I've read today, and believe me, I've read a lot of stupid comments today.
By that logic, I could treat an infinite number of things as currency, and then when the ATO comes to check up on me, I can say 'Oh well you know, you didn't *say* easter eggs aren't currency'. Think they'd let me off the hook if I said that? Of course not, don't be ridiculous!
@_date: 2014-03-15 21:51:35
No assumptions, this is from the ATO itself
If not already in effect, it will be very soon
These are not just ideas being thrown around, these are a very clear set of rules/guidelines
@_date: 2014-03-15 21:55:10
That's what the GST is set at in Australia
There's actually talk of it being increased to 15%, to deal with budget deficit issues
The GST applies to almost most goods sold in Australia, as well as imports over $1000, and is a flat 10%
GST stands for Goods and Services Tax
@_date: 2014-03-16 00:17:36
I don't believe GST applies to shares, but I think it applies to brokerage

@_date: 2014-03-15 23:51:44
Not just exchanges, but any kind of business transaction
Because the GST is paid when the business sells the goods for bitcoin, and then again when the business sells the bitcoins it received for fiat
@_date: 2014-03-15 23:29:36
How so?
The small businesses I mention that were talking about this say it just killed off any possibility of them accepting Bitcoin. Are they over-reacting? If so, in what way? 10% GST on every Bitcoin transaction is huge.
@_date: 2014-03-16 02:16:15
Fixed up the CGT part for you in the original post to avoid any confusion
@_date: 2014-03-15 21:41:56
Its kind of sad really that this is all you can do in response to such terrible news
What are you going to do now? No legit Australian business or individual would transact in Bitcoins
@_date: 2014-03-16 00:48:26
Say you pay 0.05BTC for a chicken
You don't give the ATO part of the chicken or the BTC, but the transaction gets assessed in terms of 'bartering credits', and you pay the equivalent amount in dollars.
@_date: 2014-03-15 23:37:45
ATO is treating Bitcoin as a GST applicable good, so it follows that exchanges will have to pay GST on their Bitcoin transactions


Uh.. Yes there is. Gold and silver bullion is GST exempt for example. Does that mean that gold and silver is an awesome way to avoid tax? They are still subject to CGT, as Bitcoin is. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 11:15:16
That's what happens when you believe the people here who say localbitcoins is a 'safe' alternative to the exchanges
They only recommend it because they know they can't admit that every exchange, including localbitcoins is shady and susceptible to fraud as fuck
Soz for your loss.
@_date: 2014-03-15 21:45:13
It'll be when you convert to cash only I suspect
Note: Under Australian law when its comes to taxes you are guilty until proven innocent essentially - you have to keep records under Australian law
So say you put money into Bitcoin, and then you transfer it into altcoins and then/or buy items, you have to explain that to the ATO - you have to demonstrate your innocence, otherwise it might be even worse for you as it might be treated as proceeds of crime unless you give a proper explanation
@_date: 2014-03-16 03:45:43
Oh well if you disagree with it, that's fine. There's been a lot of ignorance in this thread where people are outright denying there's a double GST charge.
They cant stop mining of Bitcoins, but I imagine they can get them once they start converting it into fiat (keeping in mind that the onus is on the taxpayer to prove their innocence). Mining isn't the primary concern here though - its businesses who are or are considering accepting Bitcoin.
Also private transactions between individuals are not subject to GST, but they are subject to CGT - again you would get caught when you have to explain why there is large amounts of money in your account when you only work as a store clerk, or why your house is full of luxury furniture.
Also I'm not sure if you're getting at this point or not, but I'll point out that if a business exchanges goods for Bitcoins, and then uses those Bitcoins to buy more goods, that does not escape GST, as GST is applied to barter as well (you pay the equivalent amount in fiat of the bartering credits)

FFS they are not treating Bitcoin like the Australian dollar
Did you even read the first article linked in the original post? Bitcoin is being treated as a GOOD not a currency, and therefore you will not only be charged 10% on the goods you buy with Bitcoin - but also 10% on the Bitcoins themselves, making it 20% in total.
Who the fuck will want to use Bitcoin when you have to pay 10% on each and every transaction?

Visited that page, and there's no mention of 'salaries, airfare and hotels when meeting with regulators'
No mention of where donations go to either - the only part of the page where mention of 'donation' shows up is to make a donation.
I asked for links to accounts of where the money is going to specifically, not your personal assumption of where the money is going to.
@_date: 2014-03-16 01:50:32
What would you do with your shitcoins? Leave them to rot? If you convert it to goods instead of fiat, you still get hit with the double GST, since it applies to barters as well
@_date: 2014-03-15 21:39:29

That just acts as additional confirmation
Bitcoin will be double taxed.
@_date: 2014-03-15 23:41:10
No, its also any conversion to cash or cash to BTC
You are confused - you think that GST is being charged on currency, but it is charged on GOODS not currencies.
As the first article talks about, this means that not only would it be a 10% tax, but a 20% tax because both the goods being sold and the Bitcoins used to purchase them are charged 10% GST
@_date: 2014-03-16 00:07:21
You're just mad because your shitcoins have been stamped out of legal Australian business
@_date: 2014-03-16 00:37:03
Explain how its incorrect
10% is paid on the goods, and 10% on the BTC - and they are seperate, because you don't pay the first 10% in BTC.
@_date: 2014-03-16 01:47:48
No, read the coindesk article again - response is directly from the ATO and says that merely transferring Bitcoins (no mention of any other goods!) would be subject to GST
@_date: 2014-03-16 02:01:44
I'm pretty sure the 1965 Currency Act has tight restrictions on what can be used as legal tender that would not allow Bitcoin to be considered 'money'.
I think the general jist from memory is that only that which is produced by the Australian government can be used as money.
@_date: 2014-03-15 21:35:41
No not yet, but its going to happen and most likely very soon
The important thing to note here is that this sends an immediate message to all businesses and individuals: Don't transact in Bitcoins unless you want to be charged 10% for every transaction, or get charged with tax avasion
@_date: 2014-03-15 23:46:28
Read my replies
Its not just tax on the goods, but also tax on Bit coin - making it 20% tax total
@_date: 2014-03-16 00:52:02
Why? The ATO has been very clear in their response.
@_date: 2014-03-15 21:47:03
Cash has no 10% GST per transaction
Its being treated as a digital good, and not as currency
This is absolutely terrible for any legit individual or business in australia who wants too use Bit coin - they will lose 10% on every transaction!
@_date: 2014-03-16 00:46:28
What are you talking about? I've explained this several times now
A business has to pay 10% on the goods purchased with BTC, and then 10% again when they cash in the BTC for fiat - making it 20%
If you paid on cash, it would be only 10%
If you don't get it after this, you're a dumb cunt
