I changed the definition to open code. When I think of open source I think of open code .. but you are correct. There is a difference.

We built the casino software our self  in 2004. We have continually maintained the script and software since 2004. This site is new, and only been "live" less than 30 days. $15k is just a number.. represented by the amount of labor I have into the site.. it is negotiable for a serious buyer. I do not build these sites as a "business". I build them as a hobby.

Our website operates from a dedicated server and is 100% safe and tested software since 2004. You do not have a clue to what you are talking about.

That is direct wording from the website. Not directed toward reddit.

This is a new website with virtually no profit. This is a turnkey website I built for a buyer who wants to get started in a Bitcoin business. It is the buyers job to operate the website and generate revenue.

The source is open to the buyer. Not to the public.

Also, included in the sale is 12 months dedicated hosting at $380CAD dollars a month. $380*12=$4560.00. Hosting is ddos protected, unlimited bandwidth and firewall protected.
Really all I'm asking is about 10k for the site. 11K if you provide your own server.
