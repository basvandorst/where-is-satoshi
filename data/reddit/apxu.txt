This is not flooding CHBS-address.
This is flooding the blockchain itself with the modified Peter Todd's script 
Somebody is storing large amounts of text data in the blockchain for very small cost (roundly 0.00001 per kb)

The biggest flaw is the thought that one can gain something for free or very cheap. No. If you pay nothing - you receive nothing or even less.

Yes. It is cost-for-community. And we can not decrease it in decentralized systems. Thats why bitcoin will die very soon. Sorry. Changing block sizes, PoS vs PoW, hashing algorithm - these things can not help.
@_date: 2014-12-03 10:28:32
Not a choice for me. Because I bet that BTC value in $ will fall down either. What is a reason for me to pay 1 BTC now and receive 2 BTC tomorrow if tomorrow 2 BTC will cost $100? I will lose $200+ even I win.

United to a mining pool owned by dishonest admin?
@_date: 2014-12-10 14:47:47
There is no such thing as "default" in bitcoin world. There is consensus. Most of current miners do not accept and mine non-standard transactions. But all nodes accept blocks with non-standard txs because of majority consensus. (of course, "non-standard" does not mean "invalid")
@_date: 2014-11-28 08:41:53
It will be better for them (and me, because I am in Russia) NOT to buy bitcoins or any other crypto.

Are you fighting for bitcoin or against bitcoin in Russia? I am also Russian and I think that we MUST have a law which forbids bitcoin and other cryptos.
I can write you in Russian, but I am not sure that you are interested in my point of view.

We do have it already in our pockets. It is green paper with George Washington painted on it.

You can see the contents of [raw transaction]( You also can see that this transaction was mined by Eligius (it is not standard, only few miners accept such transactions). You see the fee. I think, that you had several attempts to redeem this utxo. First attempt was without fee, so Eligius accepted it, but not mined. Several other attempts were unsuccesful because Eliguis already had tx in mempool.

First of all, my English is not strong enough to write "a real post" and explain everything to everyone. Second thought is that cryptocurrencies are the weapons in economic wars. I have to fight on the side of my country, not for abstract ideas. Of course, I want to share my knowledge to everyone, but you are asking too much.

Eligius gate node at 68.168.105.168:8333 relays all transactions but does not keep transactions with fee &lt; 0.0001 into its memory pool. So it relays doublespends.

Increasing block room will not decrease transaction costs in kWh (or any currency). It is the price for decentralization. Either you pay, or you have nothing. (amaclin)

No. I mean everything. Security, Speed, Comfort, Simplicity, Сonvenience... And I do not speak especially about bitcoin. This is a law of nature. 
@_date: 2014-08-20 07:28:19


This is not protocol rule. 
Some nodes do not check double-spends and do relay them.
And next bitcoin version (referal client) will relay double-spending transactions.
@_date: 2014-10-08 15:19:58
My figures are low estimate. In fact the cost for processing immutable transactions in decentralized systems are much larger. The problem is in decentralization itself - everyone have to check everything and this is less efficient than delegating functions in centralized systems. Sorry. Bitcoin is not a way to a bright future. It is only a ponzi scheme. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 14:21:54
I think it is not too difficult to buy bitcoins through qiwi, yandex-money or wm transfer. Just send them to btc-e, convert them to btc and withdraw to your address. But I advise you to keep your money in dollars, euro or even in roubles.

The total amount of electricity which eats bitcoin network must grow regardless of transaction number. If you stop it - you lose the security.

They can. But they aren't obliged to do it
@_date: 2014-12-09 16:09:44
People do not want to pay fee. At least more than in fiat/centralized systems. Right now the "cost/fee" for one transaction is $15 (yes, fifteen bucks! Just calculate energy for mining and divide it by transaction count).
@_date: 2014-12-05 08:23:27
My point is: difficulty will not grow or will grow insignificantly, bitcoin value to $ will fall. With these initial conditions there are no reasons for me to hold my savings in btc and gamble on bitbet.

@_date: 2014-10-08 16:13:00
Sorry. The equilibrium will be reached at zero-point: no transactions/ no rewards/ no value. I am a little tired to explain that the decentralized system loses on energy efficiency or doesn't provide the necessary reliability. If you do not believe me - you have to calculate expenses yourself or just wait. The end of bitcoin epoch is near.

In short words: Bitcoin and all other cryptos are ponzi schemes. One moment they will fall (these moments are different and unpredictable). The major loses will be for miners, because they invested their fiat money to a hardware. So this is a problem for a countries with cheap electricity. Russia, China, India... The best strategy in ponzi - is not to deal with ponzi.
@_date: 2014-10-28 05:38:58


Yes. They are inefficient at mining but efficient in attacking
@_date: 2015-05-12 14:03:26
There are another ways to embed data in blockchain. For example, tx  stores several kilobytes (~6kb? I do not like exact math calculations) for only 0.00412899 fee (and it is not a limit)
@_date: 2014-10-27 15:33:57

If you have problems with sending from US card to Russian card - why not to have US card and spend funds from it in Russia?

I have to add that my offer to Tim Draper is time limited. Yes, today bitcoin costs more than 10 roubles. But the times are going to change. I do not want to waste my roubles for useless things
