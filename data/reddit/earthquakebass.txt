To be used for actual payments as an actual currency.  Think scanning a QR code to pay for your coffee.

It would have changed everything — people selling (thereby enabling buyers) increased the price and drew more interest and attention driving the price up further. If stingy early adopters only shave off 0.05 BTC at a time for $1 each it doesn't exactly draw in the masses hungry for insane 1000% type gains. Considering a hypothetical extreme case where only miners are selling, miners will quickly stop mining because it just isn't profitable any more. Then you're right back to crypto being worthless nerd coins.
People absolutely must sell some to make the market and make the price go up. That’s the irony of all the “omg why didn’t I just hodl” posts, the majority of people had to NOT hodl to make hodling worthwhile in the first place.

Look up hyperinflation

Ding ding ding. This is the problem with all the talk about price going up. Whales will dump and manipulate markets.

They will... there's a reason the IRS is all up in Coinbase's business and they make you verify your identity so strongly when selling. They just haven't gotten the fangs out yet.

I'm not sure if Coinbase gives you direct access to the keys but even if they do it is still known by a third party and probably accessible to a lot of people -- support, etc. And if Coinbase gets hacked or goes away somehow, your BTC is inherently tied to them, so might be gone forever. This is what happened to people using MtGox. Millions of promised accounts just vanished...
 Whereas if you transfer them to a wallet that you control no one else has ever even seen your keys.

If you sell you've made a capital gain on an asset so don't forget to factor tax into it. Including a penalty for short term if held &lt;1 year.

Lucky! Take advantage of those sweet tax advantage cryptos lol

They wouldn't. Coinbase isn't going to put their own $$$ on the line to aid tax evasion.

Bingo, for all actual use cases of BTC (which people should be concerned about, a currency no one uses is a currency no one wants), swapping in LTC is non trivial.
