I wish I was set up so I could buy, I bought an ASIC early July expecting a few low diff rises with BTC, I could replace that BTC for less than half the cost now. I bought right when BTC peaked at $658, and despite the drop I still have positive ROI. I spent $50 on the ASIC in BTC and $20 USD at the time, I could replace that BTC for $22~ now darn it. And that ASIC still sells for a good $50+

I left a sell order of Mint open to get 0.02 BTC to spend on something else today, guess I will be missing what I was going to spend that on.
I had just started trying to do a little daytrading yesterday, started with 0.016 BTC for practice and had about 0.031 when I was done but in Alt coins.  Everything else is sunk in a coin I really don't want to sell off right now but is in my personal wallet. I guess I won't be growing that day trading fund anymore.

Most of my income comes from eBay sales. I work out of my studio apartment and barely pay the bills, paypal infuriates me so much. I went through a bad patch a while back, half my buyers not paying, and tons of fraud, almost destroyed me. I am caught up on everything except one credit card which I am five months behind on now, and nearly ready to snap my phone in half, calling me 20 times a day doesn't change the fact I have no money.
I get constant disputes over technical issues where someone just couldn't figure out HOW to use something, assumed it was defected and opened a dispute, funds locked and shit, I can't work at all for 3 days now as I have no money left.
I am trying to get into mining now, but with no money at all and everyone screaming at me that I need to pay them that is going to be tricky. So many things out there would pay for themselves within a month or two, but without any money or credit it's pure unobtainium.
Heck one of my recent disputes that pissed me off. Package going to L.A. Left Portland here the day of the LAX shooting. Tracking stops updating for a very long time, customer opens an item not received dispute and says the tracking isn't showing where the package is anymore. Facepalm ... Well it took them 5 DAYS after they got it to FINALLY close the dispute and unlock MY money. It actually cost me work too, the fact they were so very lazy literally kept me from working for a day.

That's something I had considered as a possibility. He may have used some to pay for things back when they cost nothing planning to pay it back when it got profitable, then the massive price jump burned him. But who knows.

Ah. It's going to be nice when BTC is easier to spend. I've got some, but no good way to spend it anywhere. It's sitting in an alt coin right now though. 4 months ago someone tipped me $2 for a comment I made. Let it sit for almost 3 months and it rose to $14, swapped it through a few alt currencies to around $20, it's now sitting in Mintcoin. Bought in at 5 sat, that has been bouncing between 40 and 60 sat. I've really had my eye on crap the last few days. That $2 is losing and gaining $60+ just due to fluctuation now.
Who would have thought a $2 tip for a comment could have been so useful. I hadn't really gotten into stuff before that, never had the right hardware to mine, although I can do altcoin mining now.
Edit: rambled a bit, starting point was right now for many a tip would be rather difficult to directly spend on a beer. And the inability to do much else is why I started playing around with that tip.

A ton of alt coins right now are pump and dump, everyone making their own flavor left and right, a select few have new innovation and spin on things to work differently. I'm hoping mint doesn't crash out on me, it has some interesting features that has a lot of people interested. So much so the hashrate has skyrocketed so much you just can't mine in practically right now. I'm sitting on a switchpool so I can do that then buy more mint. 
If it gets any higher I've gotta start eyeing something else to buy in low on.

How much CPU mining is still in the mix? It would be completely impractical for anyone to use their CPU to mine, BUT someone writing a virus to mine on people's machines wont care, and that does exist.

I also wonder if this 20% off will be limited to the time BTC is low, and when it rebounds they'll lower the discount. Would be a great way for them to make a bunch extra, rack in a ton of Bitcoin sales while it's down, then wait for the rebound before exchanging it. They would make far more than they discounted doing that.
@_date: 2014-11-02 01:10:02
I hadn't gotten into bitcoin before, almost did twice. First time I was told CPU mining was no longer profitable and I'd only get a coin or two a month, and my GPU couldn't handle it. Finally get a new enough GPU, oh sorry, GPU mining is no longer profitable, you need an ASIC, You'll only get a coin or two a month.
Late Last year someone tipped me $2 and I took a while to get around to accepting it. When I did and checked back at the value it was now $12. I did a little alt coin trading with it and worked it up, did a little GPU alt coin mining with my old card and bought a small ASIC in June/July right as BTC hit a $658 peak. Heard all the, don't buy an ASIC it won't be profitable. I didn't always mine BTC direct but I do have positive ROI, and now that BTC is low I've bought back almost all the BTC I spent at half cost. So the true price of my ASIC is now lower than it was.
I've just got a little rockminer r-box 36GH and a Zeus Blizzard grinding away now, both have positive ROI even with the dropped values. I have about 0.58 in all my alt holdings. It was that $2 tip that started me off.
I had like 6 computers I could have tossed at CPU mining back when it would have been a coin or two a month. Wish I had ignored the "it's not worth it." back then.
Although a lot of my ROI does come from targeting the right things at the right time. Hell my 1.4MH Scrypt Blizzard did 0.045 BTC in 3 days in August, it would have been 0.14 but I waited too long to sell.
Edit: Mined Snowballs yesterday with my 34~GH Rockminer sold early, lower than I might have been able to but got 3000 each for 1092~ of them 0.03273967 BTC for one days 34GH mining yesterday. Woo.

I sold my 36Gh miner a little over a month ago. I bought it for 0.076 BTC when BTC was $642~ + $20 fiat for $70 total at the time. I sold it for $50 and could now replace that 0.076 BTC for like $15 if I wasn't even short for bills in a few days. And I very much got positive ROI out of it before I even sold it. Gotta wait for a good chance to buy something more powerful now.
Edit: Since I paid 0.076 BTC ($50 at the time) + 20USD for the ASIC, if I buy back that 0.076 BTC for $15, it will make the net cost of it just $35, I sold it back off for $50, so in the end the final cost of the ASIC would be -$15 shortly before selling it I made 0.18~ BTC in a day mining and dumping a alt launch day. I've definitely gotten my moneys worth out of the thing, even with current prices.

I wonder, if a hosting company fucks up THAT badly, can they be held accountable for the loses. If you didn't secure properly, your fault. If they literally grant someone access themselves, that should be on their head no matter the cost.
