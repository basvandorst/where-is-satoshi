I am also pretty new to Bitcoin and the short answer is it is not worth it.  If you really have time and money to invest in bitcoin, try to do something else to earn bitcoin.  Or you could just buy bitcoin instead of trying to mine them.  
But if you are set on mining try [r/mtred](

It seems to me that there could be cause to "premine" all of the coins and distribute them to the original colonists.  This would prevent to many resources from being devoted to mining bitcoins and would allow for exchange to exsist from the begining.

How do miners decide what transactions to put in a block and what transactions to keep out?
@_date: 2013-07-21 15:17:37
That makes a lot of sense.  
"Hoarding" is basically investing in the entire economy, which does include gamblers and drunkards, but also businessmen and workers.  So you are basicialy have a stock of the entire economy.  It does seem to me that hoarded money still provides economic services to the holder in the form of peace of mind etc., so it is not the same as if it was totally lost.
"Investing" is directed at a specific portion of the economy, which takes much more time and thought.
However, with the dollar, and other currencies, savings is not a real option, because printing by the fed causes hoarded money to continually lose value.  This is in fact partially the point of printing money, people will realize that their money will have less value tomorrow and spend it today.  Bitcoin, is the in some ways opposite (although the rate of increas for the near future is much greatere that the dollar).  Which is best? I will let the market decide by which one stands the test of time.

I think in this case good money will drive out bad.
I will want to spend my dollars and hoard bitcoin. But the merchant will want to accept bitcoin over dollars.  Then like you said dollars will be driven out of the market.

So everytime you generate a new address you get a new public key and a new private key, both of which are stored in "wallet.dat"? Then to show the total you own the client combines the different owned by each key set and shows you that number?
@_date: 2013-04-06 15:41:23
Realistically it is just to simple.  A brain wallet has to be able to be memorized by a human.  Words work great for that, but everybody knows the use random words sceme.  So it is easy to brute force, because the total number of words is limited.  So somebody could, with some effort, create a list of all private keys that are compossed of four words or less, all lower case, like the one you have there.  This is much easier than trying to guess the private key that you are using.

So, whichever way inflation or deflation goes people will buy things (even if they just buy the "necessities"), which means that maybe it is not as good or as bad as people say.  People always want to buy things, even if they hoard deflating currency it is to use it to buy something tomorrow. (If you do not like the computer example, why not use big screen TVs, which are surely a luxury.)
As for Japan, I disagree, but not being an economist I cannot really put forth a strong argument as to why.

I had not thought of this. It seem like many people are getting into BTC now because they still figure that they are going to be one of the early users. Later once there are a lot of regular users then they will be the rich and powerful. As other people see this and realize they are not going to be the early adopter then they will reject it as a currency and look elsewhere, because they do not want to give power to other people.  It is possible that the advantages of BTC will over power the disadvantages and it will be adopted.
@_date: 2013-03-01 20:20:54
I think that this is a possible significant flaw in bitcoins, namely that unless everybody around the world adopted them today, the number of users will almost certainly outpace increases in the money supply, and most definitely will once all BTC have been mined.  So BTC will pretty much always have a small user base or extreme deflation.  
I am not sure how you would implement an increase in the money supply linked to BTC GDP, BTC user base, or some other method that allows for price stability.
This argument convinces me that BTC is prone to be an eternal bubble.  It does have some really strong points: Digital, public ledger, and inherent deflation are the easiest to point out, but I think it took deflation too far and will never stabilize.

Even if it is infinately divisable it still is deflating. My point is I think it will either be deflating to fast for people to want to use it as a regular price or it will have a small user base that will prevent most people from wanting to use it.  Maybe I should have said "eternal fad" instead.
@_date: 2013-03-07 19:45:33
First, realize that bitcoins are digital cna not physical. So it is hard to say that they are stored in one place. 
I like to think of them being stored on a public ledger (the blockchain).  This has an account of all the bitcoin transaction to date, and most importantly who received them.  When it comes time for you to send bitcoins you need to prove that you have them with you digital signature (private key).  Anybody that has access to your private key can say that they are you and the system does not know the differance. (It is extremely hard to forge the signature, so you only need to worry about theft.)  **Your private key is stored in wallet.dat.** So if you want to think of your bitcoins as being stored in your wallet that is appropriate also.
Bitcoins are ephemeral, so maybe they are stored nowhere, on the public ledger (blockchain), or on your wallet (private key).**

If you make a brain wallet, you must use a very complex passphrase!
For example: everybody knows the private key that goes with, [correct horse battery staple](
There are some very good post out there on how to make secure brain wallets. Here are a few tips:
Do not use common phrases, or anything from literature.  Make up your own phrase.
Do not use a grammatically correct, simple English phrase.  Add number, special characters and capitols. 
Use a phrase that is very long. 
Consider other obfuscation techniques. Such as shifting the phrase on the keyboard, using two unrelated phrases, and adding random characters.
Here is an example is that uses a few of these techniques:
"I LoVe JennY. 8675309, correct# horse@ battery! staple&gt;"
A brain wallet is only as secure as you make it.  I guarantee you that there is somebody who has a huge list of all of the simple brain wallets he could think of and is just waiting for you to put money in one of them.

Sticky wages seems to me to be a psychological problem because people do not want to see their wages go "down."  Even if purchasing power is going up if the number on the pay stub is smaller, people will not like it.  
IMHO forced inflation is really some big economic planner saying that they know better how the wage rate should change than the person earning the wage.  Which I find propsterous.

The solution I use is: I created a secure encrypted wallet.
Then I split the password using Shamir's secret sharing.  Specifically [passguardian.com/](
I created several CDs with the encypted wallet and a share of the password on it.
Then I gave the CDs to my most trusted friends and family members. So they can easily access the bitcoin in the even of my unfortunate death.

I think you misunderstand Gresham's law.  I could better be stated as "Bad money drives out good if their exchange rate is set by law." 
Bitcoin exchange rate are not set by law, so they will continue to fluctuate (probably rise) until the market determines that fiat and bitcoin are equal.

(If bitcoins realy become a viable currency.) I am sure some people really will look for private keys in all sorts of odd places.  All media will be scanned for "wallet.dat", people will look in old books or filing cabinets for paper wallet printouts, or whatever other way of digital treasure hunting there is out there.  But maybe not as exciting as scuba diving for lost treasure. 
Or stories like "I finally got around to reading the letter my grandma sent me before she died and right there was here private key."

But the thing about bitcoin is that it is extremely easy to verify the "purity" of bitcoin.

I think that you could pretty easily do it right now. Several stores I visit regularly use one computer to ring up a transaction, then another one to process the credit/debit card payment, and manually enter the amount due.  You could easily do this with bitcoin. Some of the clients out there let you display a transaction as a qr code, which you would scan with your smartphone.  It is not magically seamless, but it is as bad as what they are doing right now.

I do not understand your point.  If one of the goals of inflation is to less the effects that sticky wages would have on the economy, who gets to decide the inflation rate that best suits the economy?  If it is wage earners then we would have deflation, if it is the federal reserve then we will have inflation.  Why would we want inflation if, as you said:

One of my favorite features of [multibit]( is that is will show how many nodes your transaction has been accepted by.  This could add another area to check for the legitimacy of transactions that are awaiting confirmations.

But if you got bitcoins in the shadow economy, you probably want to legitamize them. Currently this is done mostly through currency exchanges, but increasingly via purchising of goods and services.  All criminals have legal needs.

I think this is a central point to the debate, that is easy to overlook.  The two systems are inherently different.  If you talk about "money", "deflation" and other economic principles you have to well define these basic terms because many people see them very differently.

@_date: 2013-03-21 18:55:36
One point I think about inflation versus deflation: The terms are hard to define, or at least ill defined.  I think the most realistic one is "change in the **money supply**" although it is often defined as "change in the **price level**."
Using the first definition Bitcoin is currently inflationary.   The goal of this is to create the money supply from zero in a way that is as fair as can be expected. (Satoshi could have given himself 21 million BTC, but then pretty much nobody would want it.)  After all of the bitcoin have been seeded, bitcoin will be neither inflationary nor deflationary, because there is a constant supply of money.  However, because we expect increasing population, productivity and BTC adoption the price level will fall.
Edit: I think pheonixnova said it better.
@_date: 2013-03-25 17:19:59
Bitcoin is different from traditional money in so many ways that using words like "deflation" is pretty much meaningless.  IMHO the change in price in bitcoin is due to an increase in users, instead of something caused the deflationary nature of the currancy. Enjoy the ride.

I actually think it is a case of low demand.  There are so few people in Brazil that want Bitcoin that those that do want it have to raise the price to get bitcoin into the country.
@_date: 2013-03-25 05:39:25
That sounds better. Low supply, high demand, which is made complicated by the fact that the Brazilian bitcoin market is so small.
@_date: 2013-03-01 19:30:19
I think this is one of the biggest threats to long term adoption.  Namely high price fluctuation, although at the moment it is all downward .  If you want to sell things in Bitcoin you have to constantly change the price, possibly by pinning it to some other currency, or your prices are going to be out of date in a few days.  People are used to prices changing via inflation, but Bitcoin is so unstable it cannot work as a pricing system.

I think people are actually very good at responding to ideology, especially when the full implications are made known.  I think that fiat currencies are going to crash in the near future, and people will naturally move away from useless currency towards something with value.  (When this will happen and what alternative people will use is something I can not predict.) Just think about the recent price change in gold.  In reality, practice and ideology are the same thing and people act accordingly.

The best sight I have found to tell where in the world Bitcoins are is [blockchain.info unconfirmed transactions]( (Caution: It makes a beep every time there is a new transaction. It can be silanced.) 
As far as I can tell it is just a snap shot of the bitcoin transactions that are waiting to bo put into the blockchain right now.  But the US and Western Europe dominate the transactions. There is activity from the rest of the "west" (Canda, Eastern Europe, Japan and Australia.)  and pretty much nothing from the "Global South" including Brazil, which is generally regareded and an emerging economic power.
All that to say that the total demand is probably really low in brazil, which would lead to all the stuff you are talking about.

I suggest that you use a method that you personally oversee to store your bitcoin.  Who knows when any website will be hacked or go out of business and liquidate the bitcoins you had stored there.  
A wallet has a set of your public and private keys on it.  The public key lets people send you money; The public key lets you spend the money.  This pair can be stored in any way that information can be stored: digitally (hard drive, CD, ewallet, etc.), physically (written on paper, etched in stone, etc.) or mentally (you could memorize the key, but it is not designed for that).  So if you have it stored in one of those formats it is a matter of converting to one of the other.
The easiest way to go from paper to digital is with a QR code, but generally paper wallets only print QR codes to receive money instead of send it.  The next way is to hand jam it into a computer.  Most wallet clients have the ability to accept typed private keys.  
You cannot directly spend your bitcoins from a paper wallet, since the block chain is online.  Therefore you need to import a paper wallet before the bitcoins that are stored on it can get spent.  This makes paper wallets great for storing bitcoins, but not for daily use.
Remember a paper wallet must be created securely and stored securely in order for it to be considered secure.  This is up to you.

I think that a large number of BTC are permenantly lost at this point.  When BTC were easy to come by they were also easy to lose.  Although, the kind of tech savy people who would get BTC in the early day are also the kind of people who would create lots of back up.
