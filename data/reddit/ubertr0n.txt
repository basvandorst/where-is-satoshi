lolz... as they stated themselves   
80-90% of BITCOIN computing power voted for segwit  
by consensus BITCOIN with segwit incorporated is the real bitcoin  
The idea that a innovation was not part of satoshi's vision is retarted.  
at best bcash is bitcoin 1.1 and BITCOIN is bitcoin 2.0   
is the bcashtards had their way we would all still be running windows 95   
Also by their own standards bitcoin cashic would be the real bitcoin... they forked and cashic was their original chain

I think this attack is a last ditch effort to make a shit load of money before bch dies because segwit2x is planned for 28/12/28 b2x-segwit.io
yobit emailed me today saying they have futures listed for it too

How would it "help" when its not relevant to what i'm saying?  
At no point did I claim ownership  
Bcash clown have done nothing worthy of praise but they act like its a big deal and should some how be entitled to be top  dog.  
Also, just because its open source   and the code is the same as the code pre-fork, apart from the one variable.  it is still a different coin... so referring to it as their coin is perfectly reasonable.  
Again... i am fully aware of what open source is... you are not telling me anything by pointing that out  
but... if someone was to get an open source application and change one variable... then demand that everyone stopped using the original and insist they were the true version of the app they would get the bombardment of abuse they rightly deserve.  
really the point you are trying to make would be better left for a post from someone claiming they don't have the right to fork.  
Not a post from someone saying that they have done next to nothing and its retarded for them to act like it deserves a Nobel prize

Thanks Microsoft paper clip.  
guess being famous so long ago must have gone to your head and you are trying to relive your glory days in windows 95.
Now you are in your crack and hookers days like other has been's and desperately having to show you "still got it" by pointing out typos on the internet like you've never done it.   
good for you 
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:44:51
I'm well aware of what open source means    
but changing one variable does not equate to a new product that is wildly more innovative than the original.  
the Bcash pump and dump scammers have done nothing note worthy and want to act like its a big deal.    
Do you think it would fly if someone did that to an open source linux application?  
you disputed nothing i said there.. only pics up on a word or do and thought that would constitute a cogent rebuttal   
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:57:19
and you do realize that only validates what I said.... right?
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:42:50
I believe it did  
but, I only mentioned yobit because thats where I got the info from. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:59:46
tell me  
how much chance do you think there is that... gold and silver try to hijack the bitcoin branding to give power over the top crypto currency to an organization that created gold and silver?  
are gold and silver trying to become the top crypto currency? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:12:31
they are not irrelevant especially when my point is that BTC is getting stronger each time against bcash.  
And that bcash are far from out performing BTC   
Ratios are what is relevant when comparing performance.   
Sure you want me to use USD price because the true reflection of performance risks waking you up from your fairy tale wonder land.   
also... "BTC just had the largest bull run in history" thats again just serves to validate what I said.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:39:59
yes its a hard fork  
but as btrash was the big blockers hail Mary and only started the pump and dump shit after 2x got canned.     
so even tho this 2x fork will most likely be shitcoin its gonna be better than being run by scamming low lives.    
 maybe the plan from the start was to make btrash such a piece of shit that 2x would gain wider acceptance.  
@_date: 2018-02-03 18:00:30
ahhh right  
@_date: 2018-03-16 13:42:23
yeah... useless for trading  
I used it as it would better show 385 usd move within 1 5 min candle 
@_date: 2018-02-03 20:59:32
yup  
just wait for the btrash sock puppets to cry that they are being shown to be actively sabotaging  BTC's performance so they can claim its performing bad.    
see  how well they can use their apologetics methods saying its a false accusation when there is clear evidence of what is happening     
@_date: 2018-02-03 20:48:03
yup  
antpool/bitmain/jihan wu   
btrash trash telling the world BTC is slow and expensive now openly obstructing transactions to fool the general public of the validity of their shitcoin

When we all look back at this crash  
I expect to be given credit for spotting the bottom first

ports under 1014 are reserved for common protocols  
any port between that and 65535 is free to be dynamically assigned( altho you can manually set an app to use them) to be used as sockets for any network traffic.   
if you open 2 tabs in a web browser each of them will have their own port number listening.   
you can see this yourself by running netstat in you command prompt.  
then open a new tab in your browser and run the command again and you will see it listing on an extra port.  
 There's no real way to tell what is listening on that port without using a packet sniffer or logging on to the PC.  
you will likely find that the port was just randomly assigned to a session on the fly and the socket was torn down after whatever app was using it was closed.

that doesn't make sense.  
The available block space is 1MB the block only had 79KB used.  
If its your intention to push the big block agenda then I suggest you save it for times when you are making a coherent argument.   
not when discussing a block having mostly empty  
 
@_date: 2018-02-03 17:47:13
yeah  
I get that  
but they are just losing themselves TX fees and adding to the mempool back log  by not adding more  
unless there is something else I'm not seeing
@_date: 2018-02-25 19:07:59
there so should be a meme pool  
we should start a petition for blockchain based meme storage

you bcash shills need to keep your fingers on the pulse better and keep your arguments against bitcoin current.
@_date: 2018-02-03 17:13:31
Makes me wonder why the miner didn't add more when there are still  over 10k waiting in the mempool

roger only wants free speech if it's in his favor.  
but throws disgusting, infantile temper tantrums and cries victim if someone wont use terminology that he mandates.  
compares "bcash" to the "N word" and comes out with BS that its a social media campaign .  
While he is using bitcoin.com to declare bcash bitcoin.   
the BTC reddit and the bitcoin twitter to shit talk bitcoin.  
but saying bcash is a social media campaign  
would be funny if it wasn't so sickeningly retarded
