Well, they did say they were in violation of money transmitter laws.
@_date: 2014-02-27 22:16:39
That was a very fair report.
@_date: 2014-02-27 02:26:56
Same people?
@_date: 2014-02-27 02:24:29
Okay, so they're just saying if you're acting as a transmitter without a license then you're in violation?

Down voted because the title has absolutely no indication of what the content will hold.

Ron Paul is amazing.  Instead of bashing something he doesn't understand, he simply says he doesn't understand it.  Thanks for having good god damn fucking common sense.  Everyone take note please.

They were very slow on my request as well, but they made it right.

If anyone is "praising" Satoshi, then they are praising him for the invention.

Technically, in China, you can buy them from a person and use them online.
@_date: 2013-12-02 22:18:26
I'm not so sure this is a metaphor?

Bitcoin can replace debit cards easy.  You carry your phone everywhere you go as it is.  You can also do things you wouldn't normally be able to do like if you're leaving a tip at a restaurant, you can leave a message.
@_date: 2013-12-26 07:24:23
I'm not sure that we're talking about the same thing.
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:10:20
A lot people have bitcoin as a store of wealth, not as a means of payment.  So no, we're going to sell because we want our money. We don't need to buy shit we don't need.
@_date: 2013-12-24 21:57:07
No more waiting in line..

I used to think Peter Schiff was brilliant.  After listening to him in this debate, I've lost a lot of respect.  The point that he makes about the government screwing it up or trying to end it is stupid.  Certainly somewhere down the line we will be able to synthetically make gold, so does that mean we shouldn't use gold anymore? Come on Peter, quit being so stubborn.

Baby steps.

Who verifies the verifiers of the verifiers?  I can do this all day.  With that logic is there anything you can trust?

It's like you're not even reading the arguments.  THE CODE IS OPEN SOURCE.  what do you not understand about that?  It does not matter who made it.  Do you have to trust Isaac Newton that calculus works?  Of course not, you can do it yourself and see that it works.
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:14:11
The reason I down voted you is because I don't know that anybody says they trust Satoshi Nakamoto, they trust the code.
@_date: 2013-12-23 05:55:40
They exist.  
@_date: 2013-12-05 07:03:08
Pretty brilliant idea. I dig it.

You don't need staff.  it's like scanning bar codes when you buy stuff at walmart at the self checkout.  However, now you can do it right where you bought it.  
@_date: 2013-12-26 07:27:50
Hes trying to show how absurd it is.
@_date: 2013-12-25 07:15:52
Not true, walmart doesn't require you to wait at the exit so the greeters can check your receipts.
@_date: 2013-12-30 18:40:43
I didnt even know about temp. e-mails. this is awesome
@_date: 2013-11-16 15:33:18
I'll do that, thanks.
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:45:39
@_date: 2013-12-26 07:22:42
Right now it is.. I'm talking about if it becomes more adopted.
@_date: 2013-12-25 19:54:58
I would be more pissed off at the bank for lying to you.. Tell them you can no longer trust them and they lost your business.
@_date: 2013-12-25 19:12:03
I heard you can do 0 verification payments.
@_date: 2013-12-05 07:05:10
Can you not send messages with bitcoins?  You put your table number on it.
@_date: 2013-12-24 22:04:00
you wouldn't even have to have it shipped, you could just purchase things without waiting in line.
@_date: 2013-12-24 23:44:01
Well, it would create multiple lines which would have a far less wait time if any at all.

First, you assume all people shopping on those sites are buying drugs.  SR sold all sorts of legal things.  Second, you equate illegal with immoral.  Anyone who believes that drugs are immoral needs to go back to being brainwashed by fox news.  How does it feel to be so stupid?
