Why you gotta do me like that? 
@_date: 2019-11-05 15:40:50
Especially people that follow Ron Paul lol

This is not my first rodeo (it’s my second ��) so I think we’ve got plenty of room to run yet, I haven’t even begun to hear the whispers in public yet. 
So much easier to watch all this with my experience from the last run

Zoom out
@_date: 2019-06-24 17:25:00
I’m gonna buy my BTC in the US and then go sell it in CA! I’ll be rich!
@_date: 2019-06-27 04:09:02
Waiting for it tho
@_date: 2019-06-04 01:26:35
Warren Buffet would have watched from the sidelines.

You said the negative one was "better" but you can zoom further out and BTC is doing great ����‍♂️

This explains it.

Ally just adjusted down to 2.1% (I got an email from them), I keep getting Wealthfront ads for 2.57%
@_date: 2019-02-28 17:05:16
Right? BIG OOF

Investments go up and down, it's all about timing. The volatility is what makes people rich, but no I dont think anyone would be excited in your example. 
I see this post as a round about way of saying, "it's not what it is, but its grown substantially since the local low (meaning it could see 20+ again). Are we not allowed to celebrate any small victories until then?

lol @ mint juul pods
@_date: 2019-12-16 17:46:32
Really depends on when you bought. If you bought in at the 3k valley, you're happy. 
Sounds like you did the opposite.
@_date: 2019-04-12 03:36:54
I would disagree, it can be 55+% accurate

It means you’re on a hot streak at least, but baseball has 162 games so it takes a few of those
@_date: 2019-04-25 06:39:05
What other parts of town are you installing in?
@_date: 2019-09-30 18:48:25
This seemed outrageous, so I looked. This assumes you have more than 250k with a bank. People with that much in an account probably know better than to leave it all in one place.
@_date: 2019-09-25 14:48:00
anon told me we were getting 16k by Oct tho
@_date: 2019-09-26 00:51:03
I was talking about the chart
@_date: 2019-09-19 20:05:04
Bought the dip last night and feeling pretty Gucci
@_date: 2019-09-19 20:08:38
9k is the floor my dude. Meme potential is real.
@_date: 2019-09-19 20:25:24
nom nom nom nom nom
@_date: 2019-05-10 05:22:29
Wait..I thought...
@_date: 2019-05-23 01:13:37
Naa dude, it’s a million bajillion.
@_date: 2019-05-20 15:27:01
When is the Chinese New Year? I need to make sure I get all my Bitconnects before that bull run
