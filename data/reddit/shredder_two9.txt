Will 3k be a dream after 8/9k, or a nightmare?

I am personally NOT looking forward to the crypto exchanges becoming polluted with market makers. Anyone who's a small time trader in the 'regulated' markets for a while quickly learns to despise the market makers. Inserting them into crypto markets will absolutely guarantee that the game will be rigged against you and everyone posting on this board.

Agreed. The real bottom will be reached when the dip-buyers run out of money or leave in disgust.

Rally commencing, I just sold some.

Pretty much.

No, it's in BTC.

May I suggest that those convinced it will never go much lower go take a look at a chart of the DJIA from 1925 to 1950?
This market probably has a lot of similarities to that one right after its 1929 peak, albeit playing out much more rapidly now. You can't compare cryptos to the modern US stock market because there's no PPT for cryptos. If the fear really hits, there won't be any Fed to come save you.
I realize after trying to trade this using the usual indicators and losing at that, that I have no ability to predict what this market is going to do, either short or long term, but I sure as hell don't rule out the possibility that it could tank. Stay safe out there people.

It can also be in dollars/euros/whatever you're measuring against depending on the chart.

I'm no expert, but watch the volume (on tradingview or similar) on the 15 or 30 minute chart. Right now the volume is very heavy on the big down candles and lighter on up moves. Wait for that trend to reverse. You will not buy at the exact bottom but that's ok. Remember, never try to catch a falling knife.

To be clear, this pattern is in the midst of forming the inverted head (if confirmed)?
