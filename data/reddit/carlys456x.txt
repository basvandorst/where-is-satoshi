Sorry, yes that's what I meant

Coinbase is based in the UK so it sounds like it's affecting EU citizens as all transactions are going in and out of the UK to EU and they won't be able to do that without a Brexit deal. At least that's my understanding...
It's kind of ridiculous though as all financial companies in the UK were told ages ago to act as though there will be a hard Brexit and this has to be implemented by April 19 (the original Brexit date). Most financial companies in the UK have set up subsidiaries in the EU to deal with this so can handle a no deal fairly well. Don't know why coinbase haven't had this in place yet...

Just to be clear you reckon the person who reversed the transaction accused you of some kind of fraud so your account was shut down?

If it were me I probably wouldn't want to verify it because then everyone could see my address! Yeah probably liars though. Just a scar thought still

ah okay, that's interesting to know. Is it possible to track a person's real location if you know their wallet address?

Are you able to just send it back?

This is the reason I started looking into bitcoin, I watched her do a podcast with Ryan Higa where she talked about bitcoin. She was someone I always admired as she came from nothing but ended up creating a billion dollar company from scratch and currently owns another company worth $100m. I used to watch her makeup videos when I was 13 and now I'm 25 and getting financial advice from her ��
People may dismiss her as she started off doing make up videos on YouTube but she's brilliant at investing and noticing the gap in the market. I hope she does get more women interesting in this.

What would you do then? Just keep the money and forget it exists?

Ah so at some point you were accused of fraud? Very odd situation! You would think a police report would have been raised at some point if actual fraud was suspected.
@_date: 2019-09-04 19:34:30
I believe it would have been by accident
@_date: 2019-09-05 05:58:00
Just out of interest what would be the point of sending it to a burner address? Just to get rid of it?

I'm not a financial advisor so read with caution! I read a very good article saying that crypto should make up around 1-5% of your total savings. That's personally what I'm trying to do but I suppose it depends on your wealth and risk appetite. To me the idea of bitcoin is that it should trend upwards in the long run (though obviously this isn't guaranteed), so buying now wouldn't be a bad idea. Maybe look at some price graphs of the last few months and decide whether to wait a few days or even hours! The other day I think the price of bitcoin went from £8200 to £8700 and back in a day which is quite a large difference.
