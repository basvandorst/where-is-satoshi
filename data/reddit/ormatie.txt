Have you ever bought anything online from an ecommerce store? Yes? Then you've used stripe idiot.
@_date: 2018-01-07 10:39:27
oh boy you came to the wrong subreddit lmao
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:59:19
Did you just copy paste that comment? It doesn't even address what I said. Why don't you post from your main Reddit account coward.
@_date: 2018-01-01 07:16:30
You can thank it being listed on two futures exchanges for that.
@_date: 2018-01-07 10:52:11
The answer to all those questions is a resounding, yes.
@_date: 2018-01-05 04:56:48
My go to coin for trading alts tbh. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 11:25:58
Dat ratio tho
@_date: 2018-01-01 04:23:02
Deterrent to increased adoption. Doesn't that thought alone worry you?
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:51:47
Say yes lol
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:10:40
Fuck off, if you keep shitting on people attempting to use crypto then your not gonna get mainstream adoption are you.
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:43:21
My how backwards BTC has gotten. I will always respect BTC for getting me into crypto but it's clear over time it's lost its way. I believe crypto should inherently always be fast to send and cheap to send. No matter what crypto it is. That should be an inherent trait all of them have.
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:37:48
Nah it'll just sync to the  and dip when it's dipping, and dip even more when  is pumping.
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:28:00
This doesn't make sense regarding the transaction fee situation. Transactions fees shouldn't increase with the number of users, it just acts as a deterrent for more users. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:23:17
We've all been there.
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:44:52
Eth puts out consistently 1mil txs a day, and that is about to be amplified with incoming scaling improvements. For real the numbers speak for themself.
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:11:13
Amen dude, people gotta make more noise about these issues and stop getting caught up on the speculation game. If crypto is gonna last it's gotta have utility. Right now it still seems that people are buying into a pipedream.
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:46:24
Diversify, both are strong holds anyway. But my money's on ETH breaking out this year. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:36:06
Right so you want businesses who are busy running their business to go out of their way to test a piece of technology to help its completion. This is something that should be handled by the developers themself or atleast incentive businesses to take part in this testing.
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:41:27
Yes! What an excellent choice. Well done.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:50:08
lol seems orchestrated.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:04:14
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:48:10
Welcome to the new Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:53:46
Think this was the volatility people were asking after futures
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:25:32
It's really arrogant to expect businesses to do anything other than focus on their businesses. They don't have the time or incentive to help develop a piece of bleeding edge tech that isn't in their interest.
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:46:52
Lmao dude look at the transaction speeds and costs. You are in denial.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:03:36
This is stupid and irresponsible advice. Fine go hold but people are entitled to their own decisions.
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:37:01
Honestly to the average person, lighting is way to complicated a process for the average mum and dad shop to set up, and those guys form the majority of the business community. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:48:41
I personally use eth since it's used for a lot of trading pairs.
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:41:43
I don't get why you put up with this when other cryptos clearly don't have any issues with speed or cost, e.g. ETH
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:30:24
seems a bit unnecessary to have to create an account for email notifications.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:12:29
Thanks for that. Who knows tbh. One things for sure is that there will be extreme volaility again.
@_date: 2017-12-31 11:40:20
What a fuckin trash post, way to make crypto look like absolute dog shit for crazy ignorant people.
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:29:04
What? Our high was like $27k ish and right now we are sitting at $19k. Which exchange are you looking at.
Edit: I'm stupid
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:34:15
I don't get how ppl don't understand this.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:45:14
Delta app has alerts. However they are usually delayed, so offset them in either direction buy/sell from the price point you are targetting.
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:35:00
I realised the joke soon after lmao
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:43:23
Kitties had 16 developers, lighting has 10. It's clear just due to sheer man/women power that ETG is has more ability to deal with development and improvement than Bitcoin in its current state.
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:41:55
Don't worry dude sometime this subreddit is trash for talking about ideas. Seems there's to much zealous focus on BTC all time and no talking of anything else, honestly it just drives people away.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:01:43
Do you know 9am what time zone?
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:37:08
Why did you want to buy Bcash?
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:34:49
Why be so condenscending to the very people that you want to adopt a new piece of techbology.
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:49:37
Just a quick pump and dump thanks to whales.
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:50:57
It's roadmap isnt so promising as that offered by other cryptos.
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:35:58
Do you have numbers to back up what your saying. There are almost as many addresses with ETH as there is BTC. And regardless of that fact ETH processes over a million txs a day. Seriously. I get the arguments FOR Bitcoin, but the transaction speed, cost, and scaling developments go to ETH. Bitcoin has the first mover and storage of value thing going for it which is good. But let's just speak facts here. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:07:13
Honestly, just mathematically. I'm putting my money on LTC due the amount of market cap it'll require to achieve that price. It's more of a hurdle with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:47:31
Exactly. Businesses need to adopt crypto if it's gonna go mainstream. No business out there is going to put up with the poor performance of this coin. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:03:27
I don't get how people can support this guy. This isn't good for mainstream adoption. The average conscious doesn't think insider trading is ok.
@_date: 2017-12-31 11:37:21
I agree, and given the volatile nature of crypto. No one will be accepting the risk of prices fluctuating while its in transit. Bitcoin is just not a good proposition at the moment. Sure its a good store of value, but it needs to be a good exchange of value too.
