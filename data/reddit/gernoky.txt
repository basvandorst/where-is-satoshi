Oh yes I totally agree, but if you choose to invest into the crypto market, you also must be aware that others may do stupid stuff like that which causes them to have weak hands.

Yeah you can't know, but what you can know is how much money you can have right now and you can use that for other things.
Not everyone believes that crypto will eventually recover and even then, not everyone wants to wait.
I mean what if someone bought BTC at 20.000$ and it's gonna take 5 years to go to 20.001$?
That's not 1$ profit, it's a big loss because of opportunity cost.
Also I know it sucks but, a lot of people put money in this that can not afford to go years without having that money at hand.
As it stands, crypto is not a currency and it's not a store of value, it's just speculation and to some people, a movement.
But I can completely understand anyone who got into this for other reasons to just back out and say "this shit is too wild for me".
It's not always as easy as "just hodl", sure if have the money to spare to put in and then "forget about it" or you believe in the technology and are in this because you are some revolutionary that wants to change the global financial system, then it's different.
But that realistically is a minority of the people in crypto.

I feel like some people on this sub just want to feel like Che Guevara, but without the actually leaving your room and risking your life kinda crap.
Just hodl bitcoin, live in a bubble in the internet and boom everyone can feel like they are part of a revolution.
Fun for the whole family.

"For example, if we assume bitcoin stabilizes in 15 years and experiences 10% deflationary growth per year after that, both investors and consumers would still spend."
How the hell are you going to offset 10% deflation?
I mean sure Apple has a massive ROI, but that's because the market is huge, with that high deflation the market will reduce and prices + the ROI will drop.
The higher the deflation the less investors, the less jobs, the less people have money, the less people can buy.
Also, less people are willing to spend money on things which causes more business to fail, less jobs, less investors again, no reason to throw away your money if you have a 0% risk if you just keep it and still get 10%.
I don't think it's possible.
I think best case scenario with deflation(apart from not having it)is you have 1-2% and the opportunity cost offsets that in most areas, but even then I think it's harmful for growth and can stunt an economy.

There's a difference between wanting a way to send value over a peer-2-peer network without a third party involved and wanting a revolution.
This guy is saying "the point of all this" as if everyone that has bitcoin wants to destroy banks.
I mean if he's in bitcoin to usher in a new, utopian world, that's great for him, but he doesn't have to project that onto us normal people that don't live in a dream world.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:47:27
Well what you are saying is that it's great to use bitcoin as a currency if you bought into bitcoin at a cheap price and since you already have them, might aswell use them instead of having to turn them into cash.
Now..buying into bitcoin and then using it as a currency, that's a whole other story, at least right now.
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:30:07
Yep, people are so blinded by bitcoin shooting up, they don't realize that all of a sudden they have 90% of their overall wealth in that shit.
It's easy to put everything on one thing and then when it keeps going up you act as if you are an investment genius that knew all along.
It's harder to say "Ok I'll have 20% of my wealth in bitcoin" and then cashing out bitcoin when it keeps rising, I mean that sounds counterproductive right?
But to me that's the dream, you invested into something and it shot up in value massively, now you get to cash out and diversify and possibly financially secure yourself for the rest of your life..I wouldn't throw away that opportunity just because "maybe I can get even more".
But then again I'm a risk averse individual.
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:47:09
You wouldn't buy a Nivida Geforce 560 for it's original price today, cuz you can buy a 1060 for the same price.
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:12:51
Now I'm gonna try something here, but correct me if I made a mistake with my calculations.
There are currently 20,961,202 adresses with more than 1 USD in bitcoin on them.
There are currently 8,121,094 adresses with more than 100 USD in bitcoin on them.
(Source:  )
That means most likely millions of adresses don't even have enough bitcoin to pay for the fee and many others are abandoned for other reasons.
On top of that, most people that deal with bitcoin have multiple adresses.
Even if we are extremely optimistic and do the math with the 21 million adresses, many of which in reality aren't usable anymore and assume that translates into 21 million people, that's 0,28% of the entire population.
So the real number would be way lower than that, if we assume half of the adresses are chalked up to being abandoned/multiple people owning the same adress, that would be 0,14% of the population.
No idea how that works with you saying Coinbase has like 15 million users in the US alone, maybe I made a mistake and you or someone else can clear that up.
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:44:14
10% of the worlds population own some bitcoin?
That must be a typo, that's absolutely ridiculous.
I obviously don't know the real number but it's definitely less than 1%, probably less than 0,1%.
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:12:48
Yeah but at least he owns "something".
I'm not saying owning bitcoin is "nothing", but that guy owns the buildings, the land, the cars, wares.
On top of that he owns the name and also to an extent the market even though that is not something tangible.
He doesn't rely on people believing that all these assets are worth something, if he'd have that 75% in FIAT then he would be more comparable to bitcoin billionaires.
Not saying that there aren't other materials that are just worth something because people believe they are worth something, but how many billionaires have 99% of their net worth in that one thing?
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:17:42
"In a deflationary environment people would tend to spend on what was necessary."
And that would cause most businesses to..go out of business.
Which will cause hundreds of millions, no probably actually billions of people to lose their jobs.
Also the entire society has to get used to all these things they have known all their lives to stop existing all of a sudden.
It's utopian, it's beyond utopian.
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:09:51
"To argue that no one would ever spend a deflationary currency is to argue that human beings don't have to eat, or drink water or have clothes and shelter."
These basic necessities don't give workplaces for billions of people.
Shit doesn't work like that, your plan is to basically go back to the middle ages, have some tailors, some farmers and some bakers and that's it?
Also as another commenter pointed out, the problems you point out are exclusive to the US(and probably other countries, but it's not world-wide).
The value of currencies doesn't "plummet" either, this isn't the Weimarer republic.
There are certainly a lot of problems, but suggesting we basically end consumerism and capitalism alltogether and somehow have billions of people without jobs..doesn't sound like the solution to me.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:16:06
I think that you are both right.
Yes, if bitcoin would replace FIAT then there would be banks handling bitcoin just like they are FIAT right now.
People delegate, that's what they do, you don't cut your own hair and repair your own car or go to a restaurant and make your own food.
The average guy won't want to deal with cold wallets that can be destroyed/lost/stolen, or hashes that they can type in wrong.
I mean people could buy gold and stash it under their mattress already, nobody fkin does that.
You'd have bitcoin on your bank account and a bank account number that's linked to the hash so you can have safer transactions.
But that leaves the question..what the fuck do you need bitcoin for?It's just going to do the same as FIAT.
To me, it just doesn't make any sense, all these things would only work if the massive fees would be fixed in the first place.
The principles don't change, it doesn't matter if it's bitcoin, gold, fiat or whatever.
The economy works because people or companies can loan money and use that money to create something that is profitable which can pay off their loan and benefit the overall economy by paying taxes and creating jobs which again increases spending and benefits the economy.
Without loaning there's no businesses, no jobs, people can't buy shit, which leads to less businesses being able to stay afloat, even less jobs, now all of a sudden there's noone paying taxes anymore even tho more and more people need the support.
I don't know..maybe I'm just "shortsighted" because I can't see how the entire global economy, the goverments and basically the world as we know it is going to completely change in its entirety.

"I know this sub is a circle jerk but jesus christ."
Wait so you mean bitcoin will not bring down banks and governments all across the globe and usher in a new, utopian world?
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:50:57
Well I mean..he's not wrong.
It's just not quite what he meant to say.
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:40:22
So I guess the only thing left to see is if it's gonna stabilize and be a store of value, or if it's gonna pop.
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:12:54
Oh well I'm fkin dumb, nvm.
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:35:10
Not necessarily, you can always offer a product, service, real-estate, land.
You can make a fkin well in your backyard and plant potatoes, go right back to the middle-ages.
Then you can meet up with all the townfolk and make up a new currency.
And then they lived happily ever after...but I went off-topic and forgot about the bitcoin..as did they.
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:00:54
What do you mean?Why is it good if people buy things?
Because then you can sell things and pay your employees and they can buy more things.
With deflation everything stagnates, if I remember correctly that's how the great depression from the 19th century happened in the first place.
If noone buys anything and nobody produces anything, there is no jobs, you want to start your own business?Well why would anyone lend you any money if just keeping it makes them more money from the deflation?
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:48:42
"In which way could a business depend on inflation?"
Because with a deflating currency, nobody is gonna buy anything.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:34:30
Well the trick is that you can just keep saying it will go back up forever, then you can never be proven wrong unless time itself ends.
@_date: 2018-02-04 23:36:49
Lol you don't seem to understand monetary economics
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:28:29
Yo why the hate for bottle caps?
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:36:17
Well we got pretty close and stayed close during the cold war.
@_date: 2018-02-04 23:33:38
Money stolen via inflation?What the shit.
If you have enough money cash so that the inflation seriously hurts you then you invest it, that's the whole point, it's SUPPOSED TO BE inflationary specifically so that people don't "hodl" their money.
Your money isn't supposed to become more by not doing anything, it's supposed to become more because you invest it into "real" things that create growth in the economy.
The whole idea is that if you don't use your money then it decreases, so you will invest it, which for example allows someone else to create a business, which if it's successful allows him to pay the money back to you + interest so you win, he also gets to keep profits and wins.
On top of that he pays income tax and the government wins, then they can use that to pay policemen and firefighters and build schools and shit like that.
Also now there is one more business which creates jobs, more jobs mean more people win and can not only live off of that but also now consume more which allows even more businesses to exist, which allows more people to have jobs and money.
So now even more people can consume and more businesses exist and more people can invest allowing more businesses to exist.
It's infinite economical growth that fkin prevents everything from going to absolute shit.
If you have deflation, all of a sudden you have less of a reason to invest into anything, because investing also has a risk of losing the money, the higher the deflation, the lower the opportunity cost(the money you could have earned had you invested it into something).
So all that leads to the opposite we had above, less consuming, high unemployment, leads to even less consuming, less businesses being able to stay afloat, a ton of people going into debt, the government gets less and less money.
And that spirals out of control.
I mean of course like a 10% inflation or something is bad, but a slight inflation is an agent of economic growth.
Look there are a bunch of arguments to be made in favor of crypto, but you going around yelling "inflation steals your money, all bankers are evil" is rather an argument against crypto.
