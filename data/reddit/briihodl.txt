Didn’t know you need a reddit account in order to  be able to buy/have bitcoins.
Intelligence comes with the years they say. Guess it doesn’t apply to reddit-age.

The same can be said of coinbase or any other exchange/website. Who says they aren’t funding terrorism or north korea? Who knows? You don’t.
And just because it’s settled in the US doesn’t make it anything better. 
Typical ‘murican reasoning thinking everything on their soil is superior...

It’s actually vice versa.
If you only hodl, you’re basically just hoping for a rise. Which is never guaranteed, as you can’t predict the future.
If you trade you constantly make small profits, and just grow your stack of BTC’s without putting extra money in. And once in a while you cash out a small percentage, if you feel the need to.
Yes, it consumes much more time then just hodl. But it’s less of a gamble then just hodling, if you know what you’re doing ofcourse... buy high sell low is not the way :-)

Do you live on a farm in Texas? Or do you just don’t read, educate, travel, do anything outside your usa?
Talking about narrow minded.
What’s the next thing you’ll say, nazi germany is still taking over europe, and the whole eastern side are communists?
I understand if you live in the usa you’ll be happy to use a service that is based in the usa. But please don’t act like the rest of the world is still making fires in caves and have no laws or anything. it’s just as good/bad/corrupt here as it is over there where you are, don’t make any illusions.

Or daytrade and make constant profits.
It depends on how much time you want/can spend on it.

I’d rather trust a wallet like Trezor to hold my private keys rather then having all of my investments on a website which can go down any second leaving you with nothing.
While when it’s on your wallet, you can just move along to another exchange when needed.
There are multiple cases where people bought crypto’s and let them be on the exchange/website for long periods of time, only to see that after a few years the site got hacked or has moved everything to another website and they can’t access their funds anymore.
This problem you’ll never have when you’re holding your own private keys.
If you don’t trust wallets like trezor or ledger, then you for sure should not trust coinbase as a platform to “keep your investments safe”.
Also for the record, Trezor is situated in Czech republic, not China. 
But I understand that for patriots, if a company is not from the US it can’t be trusted, right?

Good to be back here. 
Buying them cheap coins while it lasts!

Think he means the average person does only look for the word Bitcoin as you say it.
Not all people, but most people that are on the hypetrain.
But on the brightside, these people panick-selling because of this, provides you and me with cheaper coins :-)

That’s what this game is all about at the moment... just HODL, wait for the recovery and buy more in the meantime.
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:13:34
Exactly my thought!
The longest tx I’ve had was transfering my BTC to my Trezor. Took about 12hours. But since it was for “storing” I wasn’t really in a hurry.
People forget this aint Mastercard or Visa yet.

Look up “quickfingersluc” on youtube.
His video’s are the perfect guideline how to first approach safe position trading.
As others mentioned, start with small trades to get the hang of it. And if you do it the way he does you will most certainly have high succes rates :-)
Did my first few trades yesterday and I’ve turned my 50dollar buy into almost 80dollars.
Might not seem much, but it shows that the strategy works. Once I get the hang of it I’ll start with bigger amounts

Any experience with hardware wallet? Any you can recommend?
I’ve been looking into it since all the hickups from coinbase the past days.
Also, is it alot of hassle to get all your coins (BTC, ETH, LTC) from your coinsbase account onto the hardware storage?
Is a hardware storage reliable to be working still after let’s say having it for 10 years?
I’m for sure gonna google all these things as well, but a personal experience from someone has more value imo.

Couldn’t have said it better.
People need to see this is still developing... 
people forget how fast tech can develop in a few years.
But I’m giving up explaining people... if they’re scared and want to quit, they should. Only means they’ve put too much money in for their own good.

Sometimes feels like the call of duty community has suddenly all switched their interests to crypto’s

I transfered my BTC’s to my Trezor 2 days ago.
Took more then 12hours before it went through, but all fine in the end.
When looking at the transaction there was a small fee of about 4euro’s but if I’m right this would’ve been the minerfee.
LTC’s were transfered instantly.
ETH was a bit of a hassle since Trezor wallet redirects you to myehterwallet, where you have to handle everything regarding your ETH

HODL is love
HODL is life
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:09:07
One of the reasons why I bought a hardware wallet.
Not that I would sell that fast when it drops a bit...
But since I’m definitely going for the long run, the wallet provides that extra step that gives you time to think through you decission, since you gotta put it back on an exchange first and all...
I can understand that the daily traders are allways excited with the huge ups and then panic on the dips...
But with their shitposts they also scare alot of new  longterm HODL’ers for no reason...

I think chocolate means that all stuff about your mother and her pension has nothing to do with the problem here, that you could’ve just explained your problem without all the needless info of why you want to withdraw.

Mind me putting it between brackets, as it was meant as in, if he knows the fee will be 50, why the hell send 100?
You can always clearly see the amount you’re going to pay as fee, so why cry about it afterwards?
If I go to the bakery here and buy a bread and ask to pay with my card, they’ll also charge me a fee. 
Learn to read, and don’t make a shitpost for your own mistakes, that’s what I actually meant. No hard feelings towards you.
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:39:07
Question is, why would you transfer (such small amounts) if you know the current fees are so high?
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:41:08
Fee 7.50
Estimated time of confirmation: within 4 hours
Actual time of confirmation: 1 hour and 20 minutes

All kids that put all their savings in bitcoin without their parents knowing will be crying as they sold low and bought high and are now broken financially and emotionally.
All hodl’rs will still be hodl’ing and dreaming about their lambo’s.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:26:35
GO ALL IN AND HODL

Very nice! You must have got the hang of it then and reading “the story” in the sharts :-)!
I’ve been looking today to alot of sharts, but for some reason it seems I’m always looking at them the moment they’re good to sell, not to buy...
Bad luck for me I guess?

Coinbase will be like.
WE WARNED YOU ON OUR WEBSITE THAT IT COULD TAKE MULTIPLE DAYS TO ANSWER YOUR TICKET.
But but.. I was just wondering when I could finally sell my Bitc...  MULTIPLE DAYS
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:45:31
That's why you should only do it with money you can afford to lose..
When you can afford to lose it you would probably not have sold it.
Unless you made enough profit for yourself and you wanna cash out 100% there's no reason to sell on a "dip" atm in  my opinion. Especially not when you see it fluctuating from 9500 to 10.600 within 5 seconds.
Dips are there to buy more, not to sell more :-)
Just keep calm and HODL 
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:52:49
Once again proves that these bitcoin times are not only making the rich people more rich. But also gives oportunities for people in trouble to pull themselves out!
Congrats dude, you took the risk even in you situation. Good luck further on the journey! And HODL some if you can!
And not to forget “bom dia” to you :-) (as far my knowledge of your language goes haha)
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:34:15
Somewhere between 1000 HODL and 100.000 HODL would be my guess
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:44:49
It's like a huge pirate ship.
One part of the crew saw the drop and yells "ABANDON SHIP!"
While the brave others are like "HODL, HOIST THE SAILS"
