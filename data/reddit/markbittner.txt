Google doesn't publicly display to the world what you've searched. Google may know along with cookies and re-targeting. 


Fair point. Although, not a windows user. 


I wouldn't call Twitter or Instagram "small competitors". 


Just like with high transfer fees a year ago, I saw a use for LTC. Since BTC fixed that issue, now it's anonymity. Until BTC satisfies this, people like me will conduct transactions via other coins. As a secure store of wealth, there isn't anything better ATM than BTC.

you're right, mod please ban me from these children. No wonder ppl say it's a bubble
@_date: 2018-09-28 22:18:37
My mistake :)
@_date: 2018-09-28 15:17:09
Yea because so many other religions make for better governments. Just look at their neighbor Pakistan
@_date: 2018-09-03 05:29:23
OP said Silk Road specifically. Not just any darknet website.
@_date: 2018-09-21 23:29:32
Actually, now that PayPal banned him it sort of makes sense.

Just saying it's a different platform. Someone could also say "Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin" even though it's not.

Don't underestimate the power of Adwords. That little ad section below everyone's search bar represents [70.9%]( of Google's revenues.

Around 1600. Takes more than 3 years to establish a currency.
@_date: 2019-11-10 22:45:24
If you listen to Peter’s podcast on youtube (been following Peter awhile and don’t agree with everything he says) but the main points he tries to establish is a.) bitcoin is not backed by anything and b.) bitcoin has never gone through a recession.
Despite what anyone thinks in this sub, tulip-mania (which he always compares to bitcoin) lasted about 30 years. It’s only fair to say he isn’t right on bitcoin but also has yet to be proven wrong. Time will tell

I think leftists are more about the government controlling more and lesser individual freedoms (indirectly). They want the gov to HAVE the power to make you do and say things against your will for the "common good". Just lookup videos on YouTube with China knocking down houses with the citizens throwing molotov cocktails on the bulldozers.
@_date: 2018-06-24 14:40:21
Feel the same. That post was the mind of a weak old lady eating crumpets. Bring on the lows. I'll keep buying until I have nothing left to throw at this bear market.
@_date: 2019-08-01 21:49:07
Think a [Salacious B. Crumb]( is better context here
@_date: 2019-08-28 19:58:21
what else you got for excuses?
@_date: 2019-08-17 16:28:27
I'll stand corrected the minute we hear of these chinese banks running out of deposits. Until then these banks will not be hurt seeing as young people have generally little to no wealth. That's just the facts.
As another redditor pointed out, if the protestors go and try and stop the seaport (which he or she claimed was the  or something largest in the world) that would maybe bring the chinese to the table.
@_date: 2019-08-17 12:56:58
Seeing as these kids at best have $10k in the bank don't think this will have much movement
@_date: 2018-06-25 00:59:32
I would like to know this as well.
@_date: 2019-06-24 21:44:35


From [Wikipedia]( Tulip mania didn't reach its height until 1637, a full 15 years after the government was debasing its currency to fund foreign wars (sound similar?).
@_date: 2019-02-21 14:34:56
So they allowed you to buy but not to withdraw your funds?
@_date: 2019-02-17 22:52:37
One of the points you didn't bring up was inflation. There's a big portion of the BTC community that see it as a great replacement to gold. Personally speaking, I think the USD is going to have some inflationary headwinds in the near future (i.e. 3-24 months).
As everyone knows the national debt just hit $22T and we're supposedly in a "good economy". There is zero and I mean ZERO incentive by either political party to stop this spending spree. And with socialists like Bernie and AOC only getting more popular, I highly doubt that all of a sudden his country goes the other way.
Just wait until this economy goes south. We'll start to see $3-$4 Trillion deficits on an annual basis. Also that's if we don't start, at the same time, start the printing presses again like in the last recession.
So the price may go up, but just like gold, not really due to the value going up but due to inflation of the US Dollar.
Also this time around, I don't want to have a bar of physical gold at my house. Also, what if I just want to sell 15% of the bar? What if I want to get out of the country and take my wealth with me? Is the US Gov really going to let me carry a bar of gold on the plane to Mexico?
So this comment is 100% NOT about the adoption portion of Bitcoin. I think the stock market, real estate market, the US Dollar (and many other currencies) are extremely overvalued. So I have no other place I feel comfortable to put my money AND that is "untouchable" by a 3rd party.

Could you please find? As a listener of his podcast he has mentioned people making this claim and all he was showing that he did in fact have a ledger with 5 coins but had a total value of less than $100. He was making the statement to show the value (at the time of the interview) had decreased during his ownership of the coins.
Please guys let's keep the material on here well sourced and not turn into an echo chamber like @_date: 2019-02-14 15:27:43
ELi5: So what happens if the block size gets to 10MB for example?
@_date: 2019-06-24 16:28:24
Tulipmania lasted longer than Bitcoin has so far. I love Bitcoin but just saying what I get at dinner parties.
@_date: 2019-01-11 02:22:04
As positive as this is, during the 10 years that bitcoin has been around we have seen the largest pumping by a central bank in the history of mankind. Now this could prove very well for Bitcoin in the mid to long term. But in the short term we may see people get desperate. If it comes to paying rent or continuing to HODL my guess is, no matter the will power of the million subscribers in this community, people will sell for fiat.
@_date: 2019-01-10 21:22:32
My guess would be the domain. You'd probably have to pay a press release website so it got onto some high-level news site and post from there.
@_date: 2019-01-15 14:39:19
Like any investment, you should look at more than 1 year. Apple or example has been around for 30+ years yet they have had a terrible last 12 months. 
@_date: 2019-01-11 04:22:25
The real question, is this dude about to unload this on the market?
@_date: 2019-01-10 19:37:12
This is great news but until it's on I'm not going to hold my breath.

This is why every government hoards gold. Just terrible for economies. Even worse when showing a piece of paper has any value.
This guy's right. What we really need is a Satoshi printer fellas.
@_date: 2019-09-20 02:16:59
Hate to say this but everything you said in this comment is true. As much as I loved Ross after he was captured (former SR user also), as the details began to surface about the murder for hire I will just say that he let his emotions get to him. 
We can all sympathize with what he did. It was a hit made via message no different than this comment. He didn't know the guy and if someone stole over $100k from you, drug ring or not, you would be pissed. True shame is that someone as talented as him is wasting his time in jail.

Venezuelan official here. Thanks for your Reddit comment. I'll bring it up with Maduro this afternoon and let you know what he thinks.
@_date: 2018-07-03 16:22:00
Except it's not. The government has recently been coming down on dark net sellers and finding them through their public bitcoin transactions. Bitcoin needs to be more private or have some private option mechanism for it to truly act as a "Swiss Bank Account".
@_date: 2019-09-29 13:29:13
buying power of the dollar increased by 33% from 1800 to 1900. So no, needed inflation is a myth by the keynes economist that hate a currency having actual value.

I like Monero but this is just sarcasm or foolish. The minute there is a way to send BTC anonymously Monero is bye bye

They've had it for awhile now. Remember about 3-4 years ago when Kirshner started her full-socialist agenda there were droves of people taking the ferry to Uruguay to get dollars and bring them back to Buenos to sell on the black market

Pretty sure it has more to do with the Chinese Yuan in free fall
