Watch out for these types of messages, asking to exchange/receive Bitcoin.

whoa... is the memory still intact or compromised?

Alright, so Lightning network will be operational by the end of the year with watchtowers?

Assuming everyone does this...   but what if they don't?   They won't be able to receive payment?
@_date: 2018-05-27 00:10:47
Why don't we focus on delivering a scalable blockchain and improved user experience with lower tx fees;  instead of trying to argue the semantics of which is the real "Bitcoin".
@_date: 2018-05-25 21:15:40
 Scam!
@_date: 2018-05-25 22:03:42
"will happen this year"  -  can we circle back on Dec 31, and see if it's been delivered by then?
@_date: 2018-05-27 01:13:09
People are loosing money regardless,  we're in a bear market;  just because Bitcoin was the first cryotocurrency doesn't necessarily mean it'll be the one that's widely adopted and used;  especially while it still has technical issues with scaling;  another crypto can very well take precedence.

From my basic understanding LN should accomplish two things...
 - (very) Low Tx Fees
 - Fast Transaction Times
With that being said,  a LN node always running is required for you to receive transactions;  you may delegate to another party to hold the payment while you're "not online" and have the payment sync when you are back online.
Now, while the first two items are being accomplished,  there's a bigger challenge amassing:  routing.  With having several hundreds of Txs occurring,  proper and optimal routing is not an easy task to accomplish.
@_date: 2018-06-28 02:01:34
I believe experimental is the key word here.
@_date: 2018-06-27 00:03:57
As long as LN takes off,  no?
@_date: 2018-06-28 02:28:15
I'll read up more on channel degradation,  but a con with having to run LN nodes is that there'll be a good amount of folks preferring to rely on 3rd parties to store their Txs;  as such,  the network becomes less decentralized and more reliance is placed on these arbiters.

Supply and Demand;  having a finite number ensures that more can't be mined/printed, providing an additional sense of value.
@_date: 2019-06-16 21:41:52
As mentioned in other comments,  fractions can be spent instead (e.g. 0.000002 btc, etc) -  the only impractically is the network fees and potential congestion that was seen multiple times during high use (most recently beginning of 2018).  BCH forked for this very reason, to ensure tx fees were fractions of a cent so that any amount may be spent;  whereas, most recently tx fees were $5 on BTC.

hopefully it's not Facebook coin

Tx fees don't need to be high;  when you're conditioned to accept that narrative, sure;  but plenty of projects have shown tx fees can and should be low, especially when you have millions of txs taking place - the consensus method should provide enough security, along with decentralization.  Relying on 2nd layer solutions is an alternative but you're reducing the decentralization factor with having watch towers;  not to mention the increased complexity with having routing challenges.

Bueno,  if it is the Blockchain app wallet from blockchain.info,  it should've asked for an email and password to setup it up initially.  Afterwards,  maybe a four digit code, followed by the option to use fingerprint instead.
If they still have access to their app,  they should see a "Backup Funds" option from the hamburger menu.  Otherwise,  hopefully they remember their login to access their wallet online through the web.

First  ��
Now that that's out of the way;  which blockchain?
Since you're posting on Bitcoin,  I'll assume as such;  where did they buy ze BTC?   And did they transferred it to a wallet address that they own?
@_date: 2018-07-01 04:37:19
Did you get the response you were looking for?
If not,  try asking yourself:  how is the USD not a ponzi  scheme?  It may not be applicable,  but it's the same answer/response for BTC/ETH/BCH/LTC etc.

The Cat is somewhat out of the bag already and to your earlier point:  social media and news outlets talk about it now, which may attract newcomers.
What we need more than anything is an open dialogue, free to questioning in seeking understanding.  There are more dlt projects today than before and "Bitcoin" doesn't need to be the central currency for crypto.  Their opportunity to scale failed significantly when tx fees were $50+ and took days to clear.
We need a way to send money instantaneously and without charging a significant fee.  Fractions of a penny ideally that remains fairly consistent and scales, especially during times of significant use.
@_date: 2019-05-07 20:16:50
...and everyone is using it, right?
Folks are all running their own nodes, yes?
@_date: 2019-05-15 23:49:10
Feel ya man...

Bitcoin Cash may not need it;  sometimes it helps reading through the history to come to your own conclusions of what's actually happening in the space.
@_date: 2019-05-12 07:49:10
Give it time, it'll eventually come back down especially once folks start to see the increase in transaction fees.

Probably flagged by your bank as suspicious activity.

Let's make a wager:  LN gets fully implemented/deployed before bch fixes the malleability issue?
@_date: 2019-05-12 07:20:38
You know the $5+ fee is Bitcoin's own network transaction fees (see fork.lol )   Bitcoin.com wallet is all about the user having complete control over their private keys and doesn't charge any additional fees.
There are folks who ignore the fact that high transaction fees are a PIA and instead believe it "helps" provide a store of value.
@_date: 2019-05-07 19:27:35
Sure, what's stopping Litecoin from using it?
@_date: 2019-05-14 05:35:10
Not saying that it's happening,  but the possibility is real, especially with cloud service providers like AWS and their GovCloud.
Let's not forget the military helped create the internet,  but luckily (and somewhat unluckily) it was open for everyone (including hackers).
