Then formalize how the exchange rate is calculated and have the tenants agree to it. You can take the daily data point on a specific exchange or on coinmarketcap for the 25th of the month, for example.

There are around 175 million tickets sold, that's about 2^27.
Bitcoin addresses are 20 characters, that's 2^160 possibilities.

Those statisticians were slightly off!
