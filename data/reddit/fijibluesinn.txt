SWAT teams in the U.S. are not exactly legitimate special forces. Especially in smaller towns and cities there are plenty of military washouts who couldn't cut it in the real world, and are essentially over-armed mall security who are volunteers from the regular force, who properly train seldom if ever. 
There are of course exceptions, and there are good people in police work in general. Larger cities are not included in this particular criticism, although they are not completely exempt from scrutiny either. Unfortunately good cops are sometimes overshadowed by those who look for any excuse to escalate what should be health and wellfare check into a full blown no knock raid. 
The fact they would storm a house with zero Intel based off an anonymous phone call is all the proof you need. There is absolutely no possible scenario that can be made better by a bunch of heavily armed, minimally trained perssonel blindly storming a building guns blazing, with no real knowledge of what awaits them. And if the trend continues its only going to lead to more deaths, both civilian and law enforcement. 
The entire police culture, structure, and mentality needs to be seriously re-evaluated in this country. And ideally split apart. Handing out parking tickets, conducting detective work, interacting with the public, and counterterrorism / SWAT are wildly different skill sets that needs to be staffed differently by competent people in each field. And who can focus on proper training for their duties and what they are actually *likely* to encounter instead of skipping mental health and community outreach and focusing on an AL Qaida hostage situations. 
I'm sorry you had to deal with this bullshit, and I hope they find and prosecute this asshole to the full extent possible.
