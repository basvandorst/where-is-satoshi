Yes it is cheap! That is one of the reason i want to do it! Its just hard to find someone that can help with investment.. people over here are lest trustful, cose we hawe ben used.. you mostly will see people with new cars over here and those who hawe made money want to make more.. i did found one guy who could help me with cash to invest in mining rig but he did fucked me up.. :( if you are running 2KW/h machine for month you will need to pay like ~200 € maximum. I start tryn to inform people over here of such opportunity's.. but dont hawe nothin to show them.. like the same miner wich im tryn to get so badly.. and i really enthusiastic if we tallk of btc here.. my wife supports me to keep searching... but its not so easy over here for people from middle rank.. if i only could hawe a opportunity .. im a hard worker and was always worked fair.. but you cant be fair in Latvia.. most are corrupted.. :( 
And if you ask how old im so im 29.. and i found btc! And i know i can get far if i will be fast to adopt it here.. good luck!

so help me with someone who can help with investment... will pay back in double! sure its gonna be like -3months.. No one can.. and will invest money over here in LV!! 
 I was talking with many people over here.. to hel mep land some cash.. but no one wants they are cheeezy over here :( 
 people here in Latvia are not informed of such a thing like Bitcoin!
if there is an miner here who carries nice amount of btc who can really help..  :( 
 + any business is a risk..

there are not so many opportunities here in LV to do... so this is i think the best way to take chance! why not? im sitting on web like -4 months and reading all infos whats going on with BTC.. 
 can anyone deny this investment... ? If the large companies are getting in it.. Japan and Russia already starts to change they r mind.. of btc?!
 this all is so massive! and i think in summer.. end of it.. gonna be huge for BTC !
