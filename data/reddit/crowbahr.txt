Fiat currency is by definition not backed by anything.

The definition of Fiat money:


So no: if it's backed by anything physical it's not fiat.

In all fairness Eth's network is being worked on to try and scale up to Visa levels of transactional throughput. 
All Cryptos are in their infancy. I think Eth is the developer's crypto: built from the ground up with future apps in mind. I think BTC is the every-man's, and I think that's the scale of adoption we're seeing now too... though the price hasn't settled yet.
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:00:30
Probably, but if it truly has settled into being an everyman's crypto then it shouldn't matter when speculators pull out because there should be enough demand to float their pulling out.
@_date: 2017-08-12 20:02:26
Thanks for pointing that one out. 
The Eth subs are talking about BTC having $1 and 1hr tx and a lot of people pulling coins to hodl. 
I'm impressed with the surge. Really wish I'd bought on Aug 1.
@_date: 2017-08-25 08:12:16
No, I'm not talking about paper asset. 
I'm not putting my 2 million into fiat currency, I'm putting it into stocks, bonds, 401k etc. There isn't a way to buy stock in a company without turning BTC into Fiat.
So I'd cash out BTC and put all of it into the safest types of investments which I can dependably withdraw from. 
It's a 100% surety vs a 90% surety. BTC almost definitely will continue to grow past whatever point I'd cash out at... but a diversified portfolio over 60 years *will* grow enough that I can live comfortably indefinitely. 
I'd rather have a 100% chance at an upper middle class life than a 90-10 that I end up fabulously rich or miserably poor. 
I could buy a 500K house, invest 1500k* and then withdraw 40k every year and never go broke. That's worth more than the lambo to me.

Not more "real" but if I could cash out 2 million in from BTC to Fiat I absolutely would. I'd invest it incredibly conservatively and live the entire rest of my life withdrawing 2.5-3% and living well. I wouldn't have to work, I could just do side projects that I could then maybe invest into riskier things... like an incredibly volatile new currency.
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:46:22
2 Million I'd cash out completely, invest everything, retire and then use side projects for money and fun. To quote myself:


If I had to sell every BTC for Fiat to get 2 Mil I would... and then I'd go invest into crypto again with my extra "IDGAF" money.
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:44:04
It was late when I wrote that and I mistyped. I meant 1.5M or 1500K. 
I was talking about 2 million after all.
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:47:05
If I own nothing but bitcoin and have to sleep on the street I'm not rich.
You're not shattering my world view. You're not even changing it.
You're simply spouting off insanity and comparing the USA to the Wiemar Republic and Venezuela. Might as well compare the USA to Zimbabwe with their 100 trillion note. 
It's not the same at all. Yes fiat is intrinsically more risky as it's controlled by governments that cannot be trusted to act in everyone's interest... but simultaneously I'd still *rather have money in stocks and bonds* instead of having money just in BTC. I'd rather have a place to live than have 100 billion BTC that I hold. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 08:18:27
I have a lot of nickels to sell you...
@_date: 2017-11-01 09:17:46

He's the worst day trader of all time then isn't he?
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:23:37
So you're already spending an ass load on the 200gb/mo that Bitcoin uses in data?
Because bandwidth wise you're only using 50kb/s tops and quadrupling that I'd still negligible.
@_date: 2017-11-18 08:12:09


I mean, on the one hand I can't blame him.
On the other hand... sketchy as fuck.

Gotta go get money for more bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:26:23
That's stupid. I got 0% apr on my car. Why wouldn't I take the longest pay schedule I can? It'll be the same amount of money in the end except inflation will have decreased the dollar value. Cars already lose value so quickly why put more in early?
@_date: 2017-09-10 17:47:08
Bitcoin is money like gold is money.
It's clumsy to use, retains its value well and is better dealt in bulk than small transactions.
That's not to say all Altcoins are clumsy, but Bitcoin is too big to be nimble. You'd pay too much in transaction fees to do small transactions.
@_date: 2017-09-10 21:12:36
While true the issue is that the larger Bitcoin gets the more expensive it'll be to trade in small amounts. So then you've gotta build systems around it like you said.... Where you're saying that the traded currency is equivalent to the gold behind it... Starting to sound a bit like gold backed paper currency now aren't we?
@_date: 2017-10-24 08:29:00
I think?

6 eth purchased from Aug ( through Nov (477).
Sold 3 on January ( to pay for my honeymoon. Turned out to be a great move when I was feeling like I was selling right before it blasted off.
So I have no idea what I'm doing and got very lucky. But all my eth is minimum doubled in value.
@_date: 2017-09-18 21:07:58
I mean that also looks like last week in Bitcoin.
But its also better to be distributed in investment, definitely.
@_date: 2017-09-01 08:55:48
Yeah when you can't use BTC cause transaction fees are $150 it might be time to cash out.
@_date: 2017-09-21 09:36:59


In all fairness they also deliver on that advertisement. It's not all smoke and mirrors, they have faster transactions and lower fees. 
BTC is expensive to transact and slow. Prohibitively so for Venezuelans to really use as currency against their government. Lightning should help that.

Brass and Lead being the value is a metaphor for violence being the only law.

Wait you asked for evaluation of the expression.
Is that true or false?
chanceWarrenBitcoin == 0 = true?
@_date: 2017-09-11 09:31:26
That's a pretty contentious statement in this community in all fairness. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 11:47:56
I mean that would've been 5k -&gt; 500k. 
It'd be really hard not to.
@_date: 2017-07-18 22:35:50
K I'll buy Aug 1. Sounds good. Been waiting to jump in.
