Jesus? That is what ‘Bitcoin God’ is for. LOL
Honestly, who forks and calls it ‘Bitcoin God’ - truly stupid

I understand what FOMO means, but what is the Opposite? So when you don’ t want to sell,....FOSO (Fear Of Selling Out)?

Could you please send your comment to me 6 months ago?

For me it use to be all about FOMO. Now it is all about FOSO (Fear Of Selling Out).

Kraken support is top notch. Have used their services multiple times. Very professional.

I use Canada Post to do an In Person Payment (IPP) to get funds to Kraken . Kraken sets you up with a QR code first, then Canada Post  scans and sends. Up to $500 a day and they charge $3.95. Gets sent in under 5 minutes.

I once spent several minutes arguing with a Bitcoin rep at a road show about “How can you justify Bitcoin is now worth $1 USD!” Boy do I feel silly. 
@_date: 2019-05-19 20:13:41
Good points. Yes BTC is still leader. 
I find below also interesting.
ROI from current prices back to ATH’s
BTC 150%
LTC 295%
ETH 449%
XRP 708%
I think ALTs have started to prove longevity and worth considering beside just BTC.

Agree. Most modern printers internal memory stores the last several prints. At work we have to wipe the memory before returning.

Agree with everything before. Would add to diversify a little in the ‘safer’ coins, so 30% Bitcoin, 30% Ether, 30% XRP, and 10% in something else you want. Dollar cost average monthly with money you can afford to lose. Do not go all in. Good luck!

Download the coinmarketcap app. Go into tools, then Currency Converter.
