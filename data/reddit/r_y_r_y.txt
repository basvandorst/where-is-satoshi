This is an interesting research topic.

If you were to exploit man in the middle in a densely populated area (we're talking drone flying free wifi in the middle of a Taylor Swift concert and we also assume all 60,000 people are googling something constantly) then we're paying out around $100 per hour in zen cash. It used to be $400 per hour since cryptos had higher prices last December. Assuming the optimal cryptocurrency to mine at any given time, idk haven't done that in depth of an analysis.
In total, not very profitable.

that makes sooo much sense. thank you!!!!!!

Do you know, is that master public key exposed in any way during a transaction / is it stored in a bitcoin transaction in a way where it can be retrieved?

Right which is why I'm trying to wrap my head around how scanning the blockchain gives you the net worth of a person's history when all the public keys are different.
But thanks for the statement. I updated my post to say associated with a private key.

Hmmmmm. Unfortunate. I'm guessing that's for bitcoin core developers. I guess I was looking for something in the middle. This reddit seems full of finance people, traders, shillers, developers, memers, and everything else. I guess I'm looking for software engineers who are building on top of bitcoin's blockchain but are not core developers.
Thanks for the info!

I know, lol but the metaphor works that's why everyone says account. I edited the post to say associated with private key.

I could use a blockchain explorer but I want to validate their information instead of taking it at face value you know.
@_date: 2019-03-12 19:23:54
I definitely agree. Even so, how can I verify those addresses?

The above is a fun project some friends and I made. I hope you enjoy!
