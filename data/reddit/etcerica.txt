I would have a 0% capital gains rate for 2013 since I just started working.   Currency treatment definitely will result in higher taxes paid, so I'm comfortable with the position.  Can't say I'm not hoping for published guidance that lets me amend later, though.

Dat sweet sweet circ 230 notice.
Only thing I would add is the statue of limitations issue.  They can always get you for civil fraud.  
Even as a tax nerd attorney myself, this stuff is scary.  I'm paying an accountant to handle it just so it's not my name at the bottom.  Although, he plans to take the currency position, which he said was the conservative approach...

I wasn't convinced until you added the Rage video

Then you get sniped by a cop, and all your tax worries are over.

So what do employers do about payroll taxes and withholding if the program doesn't do it yet?  My husband is paid partially in bitcoins and our taxes for last year were a nightmare.  First company to solve the problem wins...

My husband is paid partially in btc, and we did not enjoy receiving btc trading at $950 on payday that is now worth $800.  We paid income tax on money we may never see.  It's too volatile to keep in btc unless you don't need it to pay bills.

The investigative method they would likely use during an audit is called the expenditures method:

Wage garnishment, tax liens on your real estate, personal property, and bank accounts (secures their interest), levies on your property (physically taking it), or a combination.

Someone hires a forensic accountant, subpoenas, requests for production of documents, threat of being held in contempt, perjury issues...
Hiding assets in divorce proceedings is going to end badly for the liar.  If you're worried, get a prenup or a postnup.  Not that hard.

It's actually one of the reasons I think major tax code simplification will never happen - all those accounting and legal jobs, poof!

Ooh, only two comparisons of taxes to rape so far!

That's exactly what we are doing now.  We set an amount to leave in that we're comfortable losing and we sell the rest. The crash happened right after his first btc pay and we hadn't settled on a number yet.  I'm not as optimistic as he is with future projections but I'd hate to be out of the game entirely.

Ha - when he got his first at $10 each he asked if he should sell.  I said to hold and see what happens.  It's worked out.  But I definitely get more anxious as the price goes up.

If they get you on civil fraud, you pay the tax, giant penalties, and interest.  Only criminal tax fraud leads to jail.  It's harder to prove and thus a less likely outcome.  
Oh wait, I mean firing squad!  I forgot how violent the IRS is.

The only way to fix that problem is to move away from the self reporting nature of our system.  I honestly don't know how automatic income reporting could feasibly be done for businesses, but it's the self reporting feature that's the problem, not necessarily the complexity of the Code.  Most people calling for simplification want things like a flat tax, national sales tax, no AMT, etc.

I'd plan for $150 per hour.  I'm an attorney billed at $160/hr and have hired an accountant for $150/hr for our btc stuff and will pay him in btc.  More experienced attorneys and/or larger firms will be a higher rate.
