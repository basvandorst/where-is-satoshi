I call BS. If I knew I had a lost wallet from years earlier when btc was hitting 19k, I would tear my damn house down to find it
@_date: 2019-08-23 01:24:40
Finally saw the light y'all. Dumped alts and now all in on BTC. Ill just go ahead and press the moon button

Where is the sticky daily discussion
@_date: 2019-06-26 00:39:03
An hour ago I predicted 12k within 3 hours. So far were heading there!
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:28:16
I want to sing Old Man Signe
@_date: 2019-06-30 01:52:09
So the pizza price is in dollars but that is instantly translated into a btc amount on the fly?
@_date: 2019-06-20 18:37:21
Remember how fast BTC went from 9k to over 20k back in 2017? Less than a month! Hold on to your butts!
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:11:58
I dunno but i need someone to hold me and or pinch me.
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:32:07
What if i kissed you on the mouth
@_date: 2019-06-25 22:58:28
Yep! So many fortune tellers a few days ago warning us to sell and buy the dip.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:00:34
This kind of action is new to some of us! Id like to just ignore it but it is fun to follow and sweat it
@_date: 2019-06-25 21:58:09
If youve been holding bitcoin for a couple of years and are just now starting to breakeven or see green, it would be a terrible mistake to sell now. Hold for two years for no return on investment?  No thanks!
Obviously just my humble opinion.
@_date: 2019-06-12 16:20:35
Exactly! That's why I hate all the attention given to the guy who bought pizza with his BTC.
@_date: 2019-06-21 17:32:19
BTC cant stop wont stop
@_date: 2019-10-15 19:04:56
I thought this bot was cool. Then it stopped the predictions and started retweets like ita like depended on it
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:01:30
Lol man you really hate vegetarians lol
@_date: 2019-06-21 13:06:56
What a whiney response
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:39:29
It wont stop but in the wrong direction  ��
@_date: 2019-06-22 01:43:12
1k daily gains will seem like business as usual soon enough
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:57:31
It will be  back to 9k really soon and then we can all relax
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:59:39
The harder a ball slams down the higher it bounces back . Same thing here....I hope
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:29:15
Queue the "I am the Juggernaut bitch!" meme! Do it!
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:52:25
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:42:58
What's gonna happen when they wake up over seas?
@_date: 2019-06-25 22:25:44
Ok so when do we visit other crypto reddits to say hello to the poor people? I kid I kid but this is my first time seeing this type of action while holding btc and it is freaking awesome!
@_date: 2019-06-25 22:39:55
Im strictly amateur hour baby!
@_date: 2019-06-30 01:29:39
How do you price something  with bitcoin? The price is swinging all over the place
@_date: 2019-06-12 16:50:23
Yeah but the media tries to make him look like a dumbass who squandered a fortune in bitcoin on pizza. That is not at all what happened.  If he hadn't bought pizza he would of probably sold at 5 or 10 or 1000.
@_date: 2019-06-04 01:19:49
True crypto genius speak only in satoshis.
@_date: 2019-06-25 22:26:17
Should happen within 3 hours.
@_date: 2019-06-26 06:34:46
Same! Just felt like i had to diversify but i was not expecting anything like this
@_date: 2019-06-25 22:59:08
I dont have the skills to anticipate when that will happen. Ill just hold and hold and then ill hold.
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:39:13
Hope so!
@_date: 2019-09-06 17:49:05
That's what i want to know
@_date: 2019-09-19 21:57:21
Ask them how well they understand the U.S. dollar. My guess is they dont really.  Same with bitcoin,  dont need to fully understand
@_date: 2019-09-19 23:21:09
Right but people don't really understand why the dollar works. Thats was my whole point
@_date: 2019-05-24 22:14:35
On board with btc dont give a shit about gold. U keep it
@_date: 2019-05-18 18:19:16
What is that?
@_date: 2019-05-24 21:04:23
But it's just a shitty little rock from the soil. I have no need or want for it
@_date: 2019-05-25 00:05:30
How they gonna get to your email without your titan security fob
@_date: 2019-05-24 21:57:11
I dont need or want it. I also dont know how to authenticate it. So if you offered me a gold bar I'd have no clue if it is real. So worthless to me. Our country no longer runs on the gold standard so stfu about gold a hole
@_date: 2019-05-18 18:20:10
Sorry I meant what is the sign you're seeing
@_date: 2019-05-24 22:23:49
Ouch.
