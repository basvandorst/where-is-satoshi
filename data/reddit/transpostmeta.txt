Unless everyone carries a smartphone, you need actual, physical currency to buy stuff.

Just advertise the price in dollars, then define the cost in bitcoins at the time of the actual purchase.

What possible advantage could bitcoins have over Euros?
@_date: 2011-07-03 12:10:35
You think the inflation of the Euro is a bigger risk than the total randomness of the evaluation of bitcoins? Seriously?
@_date: 2011-07-04 13:48:41
This is more true than you imply. Many vocal bitcoin advocates have no idea of macroeconomics.

Just use squarespace or something similar, no need to mess around with VPSes if all you want is to host a podcast.

Then maybe bitcoin will be able to help in such a situation in ten years. The thread title suggests it being ready right now.

I don't understand the calculations on that padded password page. The search space would only change if the attacker somehow knew the contents of your password before starting the attack. Since he doesn't, he can't know, so the search space stays the same at all characters that are permissible. 
The attacker might guess that you prefer lower case characters, but that would only mean that passwords with upper case characters are more secure in general, rather than that a mix is most secure.
Oh well, I guess I'll see whats up tomorrow.

I'm talking about Belarus, which is what the thread is about. And no, not everyone there has a smartphone, not even close.
And just to ask again, what possible advantage could there be to re-equip the entire country with printable bitcoins and smartphones and internet terminals at each bakery as opposed to using a real currency?
Look, I do think that bitcoins have transformative potential, but even talking about using them as a replacement currency for an entire country right now is simply stupid.

That just makes them seem like a bunch of techies to me. Not a bad thing.
@_date: 2011-07-05 20:46:35
Yes, and the advantages of those. It's not like internet libertarians are the first people to figure out how modern currency works.

You could use the Silk Road market. It has a built-in escrow and web of trust system and is anonymous. You can also fix your prices in dollars and the btc value will automatically update.

Maybe, but that's not the point. As it stands, bitcoins are far more volatile than the Euro, even if people are afraid of inflation of the Euro.
@_date: 2011-07-03 20:01:11
I simply can't see any advantage bitcoin would have over any real currency in this situation, and I can see lots of disadvantages (no cash money for day to day transactions being one of the first that come to mind).
@_date: 2011-07-04 15:04:59
True, but they have at least thought about some problems at length.

That's silly, unless people start getting paid in btc and do most of their purchases in btc. For years after Germany switched to the Euro, people still were thinking of Deutschmark when they wanted to gauge the price of something. 
@_date: 2011-07-04 14:39:13
A bigger problem than the volatility of a currency that changed in value a hundred fold in six months?
@_date: 2011-07-04 15:45:28
No serious macro-economist seriously believes they have all the answers.
