Don't sweat it. One key thing I try to keep in mind is you'll never make the perfect buy/sell. Don't get caught up in what you *could* have made. Just celebrate what you did make. BTC will hit $13,000 again and when it does, be happy on doubling your money.

I'm holding on to some fiat money in case it dips farther. A bottom of around $3600 is very possible.

Really? Any good alternatives?

I can understand why people would be hesitant to use Bitcoin for thousand dollar purchases. I was referring more to owners of coffeeshops or comic book stores.
That being said, as an enthusiast, I am very glad you're putting it out there.

Boy, I really wish I had the ability to untangle what it is you're trying to communicate.

I have been trying to convince various local business owners to accept bitcoin as payment because they will get business from people who just want to spend it, but they are all too spooked.

I really appreciate your reply. It's always good to have theory checked by reality.
If you don't mind sharing personal details on Reddit, I am very curious what type of store you run.

I think comment was correct, if harsher than I would have put it.
Maybe saying OP’s comment was not well thought out enough would’ve been a better way to phrasebit.

Unfortunately, enthusiasts like us need to acknowledge that there are still issues that need to be ironed out with cryptocurrency. The financial industry does **not** like change and does **not** like problems. This is why the American banking system still uses the cobol language on their computers.

Depending on how high the value of the transactions are, I can see why people would be reluctant to spend. I'd happily buy low value thing like a cup of coffee or a record or something with BTC. But I would not want to make a mortgage payment on a house with it.

Thank you

Aw man. I'm not trying to be the politeness police or anything. I think it's really just more a matter or without context, text can often appear more aggressive than intended.

Thank you

Another downside is that it is a lot slower than a credit card transaction.
@_date: 2018-07-08 00:48:20
What was the hassle?

The correction is not over. I still believe that it will rise above previous highs, but it could be a while.
I bought in at the end of 2013 when it was on it's way up at $800. It spike at around $1200 and collapsed. I was in the red for almost 4 years on that one.
