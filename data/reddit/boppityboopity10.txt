Good point. But, me not knowing the devs connected with bitaddress.org, (or any other similar site), there's no way I can be 100% sure of the code based on personal trust. I guess I'll try to get as close to 100% as possible and that'll have to do. But you're right. It's never a sure thing.
I'm currently going over the page, and I do like the fact that none of the JS is obfuscated/minimized/loaded from a remote source/etc. The vars are named plainly and descriptively. It's commented clearly. All right there in front of god and everybody. So if there *is* any hanky-panky embedded, somebody's gonna find it.
Oh well, onward into the fog. 8-) Thanks for the info.

:-D Dayum! That's hardcore. I'm such a smallchange player on Coinbase, I guess that's why they don't even show me that level exists.
I wonder if Level 3'ers get to meet Satoshi?

What does "Level 2 and above" mean? I thought Level 2 was the top level.

I did a view source and the whole magilla is on github.
The github README sez...
*The bitaddress.org project provides an all-in-one HTML document with embedded
JavaScript/Css/Images. The JavaScript is readable not minified and contains no
XMLHttpRequest's (no AJAX). The benefit of this technique is you can load the 
JavaScript locally and trust that the JavaScript did not change after being 
So..., if I copy the "all-in-one" HTML to a offline machine. And convince my paranoid brain that the JS isn't inserting any identifiable tokens. Then I can generate as many key pairs as I like, and import only the public addresses into some program like Armory. Until I want to spend the coins - at which time I've got the associated private keys.
Thanks for the info.

Very cool. I might give that a try.

Seems to be that it accepts the creation of a numeric pin, but appears not to because the timeout is linked to the phone lockscreen timeout. (In my case 15min)
I open the app, create a PIN, close app, open it again 30 seconds later, it doesn't want the PIN again. But if the phone's lockscreen kicks in it also resets Coinbase to be logged into again.
I guess the wisdom of that strategy could be argued both ways.
Anyway, now I know. Thanks for the info.

The ~~above~~ below is a reply to you. I put it in the wrong place. 8-)
