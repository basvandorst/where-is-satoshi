It sounds interesting. I am just wondering about your mentioned card to paper wallet process. So the card processors authorize the amount, take fiat and deliver crypto to the customer in form of the paper wallet so the customer could handover the paper wallet to the shop. And shop will convert this paper wallet into fiat later on. I am right?

You bet. Going downhill is always easier than going uphill...

Another update.
LocalBitcoins support keeps closing my new tickets with the following reply:
`You have another support ticket open.Due to big support queue at the moment, we will consider this ticket resolved, and your issue will be handled as soon as possible in the ticket you opened previously.If the another ticket you have open lacks information which is available in this ticket, please update the other ticket which has not been replied. This way you can help us to resolve your issue as soon as possible.Please note, that opening multiple tickets about the same issue will make it more difficult for us to resolve your problem.`
Even though I asked for help with the verification, they replies with this:
`Thank you for verifying your identity, your account is marked as ID verified and you are able to open trades for advertisements where the advertiser requires it.If you have submitted a company ID verification request please reply to this ticket stating so and it will be processed as soon as possible.Please let us know if you have any questions.`
So it is really screwed up.

Actually they are certified in EU now. Which means I can file a complaint to authorities as a customer, and authorities will take legal actions. Not me.
So, I am going filing a complaint with Finland authorities, I think this is gonna be an issue for LocalBitcoins.
To file a complaint I will use this one:

Thats what I thought. Because my friend with just 0.2 BTC got his account verified no problem. I did the same shit for verification, even used scanner to get glare-free pictures... 
And... yuck... its not gonna work this way...
So my thought is they are just getting with it.
I am expecting them to unfreeze the account as soon as bitcoin will hit a bottom. That will prove they are just using the funds to trade for themselves.

You probably won't believe me how many times I tried different browsers Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge. And how many platforms like iOS, MacOS and Windows.
Since no proper reply from support I have created 6 tickets already.
Sent dozens of screenshots.
I did anything I could, but support is not there anymore.
@_date: 2019-11-19 21:59:56
I've already did. Several times. No answer from them. A week passed.
@_date: 2019-11-20 19:44:14
I know. But I trusted LocalBitcoins for 4 years and have been a loyal customer...
Not anymore...

Oh, they are in Finland my friend. Long way to go.

Very high fees this shop have. 
@_date: 2018-11-17 08:14:35
Yes, 100% correct. 
@_date: 2018-11-17 09:39:25
Sorry, it is not clear what do you want. 
Do you want to accept cards, but all payments to be settled in crypto?

We’ve been there before. 
Two years ago I remember praying for price not to fall below 160 as I had a mining farm that time. And I remember I was selling as soon as I mined. And I regret that because if I could wait a little and sell for 2000 or maybe 3000 that would make my ROI tenfold. 
Don’t worry about the price. It will recover sooner or later. There is no other option but BTC, not even ETH or LTC. 
BTC is pure idealistic crypto. Let it go. Learn lighting, adopt it while you have some time. 
Your efforts will payback. I know it.
