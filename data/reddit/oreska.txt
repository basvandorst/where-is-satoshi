I'm kind of worried about anonimity when using bitcoin. For example, let's say I buy something online with bitcoin. What's to stop that retailer from checking out my address on the blockchain, seeing where my money is going, and using this information against me?
Should I be worried? And if so, what's the easiest way to secure myself?

This is actually good news.

Are you kidding. Bitcoin is perfect. It has no bugs.
Plus, It's open source. I mean, can you name any open source software that had a critical bug with major implications in recent history?

Bitcoin - send money anonymously, instantly, with no fees all over the world, except it's not anonymous, and a transaction takes like 10 minutes, and there are fees. But you can send it all over the world!

What if your bitcoins are down, and you're 99% sure they're going to go down even further? Should you still hold your bitcoins because there's still the 1% chance of them regaining their value?

If you had 30 bitcoins (going from the title here) and went to a casino, you would have a 1% of getting at least a 95x return (including house edge), leaving you with well over a million dollars. So yeah, I don't buy the 'this only happens to few people in their lifetimes'. Otherwise, I pretty much agree with you.
