Out of all the consensus mechanism you have seen so far, proof of work, proof of stake, dpos, dpow, cpow, ripple, etc.  Which one has impressed you the most and why?  
@_date: 2015-12-22 16:11:17
why aren't this one on the top?  i laughed really hard.  :)
@_date: 2015-06-10 05:50:26
Thanks for clarifying.  However, could you clarify on what it means that "Open Assets has no concept of nodes".  If there is no node, who is verifying the data in the OP_Return?

What we really need is 5 years moratorium from regulation to allow bitcoin to grow appropriately.  No regulations for 5 years.  We can revisit later.  
@_date: 2014-07-27 16:46:41
Well put.
@_date: 2014-08-30 19:22:31




Well said.
@_date: 2014-07-27 16:45:53
That is true.  
@_date: 2014-07-29 21:26:58
Here's a compromise.  BitLicense will only apply to large corporations physically registered in NY.  
If consumers actually feel that the companies in NY has better consumer protection, they can vote with their feet by using the businesses in NY.  Consumers who do not feel like it could use services in other place.  Consumers will have the freedom to choose.

Facebook, Twitter, Google may still come to exist, but they may be started from other countries if USA is the country that created IntLicense.  Fortunately, USA went the opposite route.  All we are asking now is that USA would extend the same consideration towards bitcoin.  Give it some time to grow and see what kind of new utilities can come out from it.  
@_date: 2014-12-09 10:16:07


Great great point.  Currency laws suck.  Declaring bitcoins as currency would impede its growth a lot by bogging it down in regulations.
@_date: 2014-08-20 07:00:47
I am not saying this is good either because of the problematic tax.  But we need to be careful government can really get you in more ways than one.
@_date: 2014-07-29 21:36:28
Some of these services could do that.  For services like ChangeTip on Reddit, they won't be able to do that unless Reddit did this and pass the information to ChangeTip.  The best thing would be to exempted from BitLicense.
@_date: 2014-07-26 17:41:56
Well said, Sir.  
Here is a really good quote.


* Force innovation to more understanding and technologically sophisticated jurisdictions
* Turn legitimate innovators into criminals, and legitimate innovations into crimes
* Restrict the development of non financial uses for blockchain technologies
* Impose unnecessary restrictions upon interstate commerce
* Restrict free speech
* Likely lead to embarrassing court losses for regulators
@_date: 2014-07-29 21:21:06
That sounds very reasonable.  
However, there are many bitcoin services that are not a website and cannot identify the user.  
Eg. your desktop wallets such as Bitcoin Core and Armory.
Eg. Changetip on Reddit.
I think these services should be exempted from BitLicense.  
@_date: 2014-08-20 11:19:17
I want to say that the tax part is really bad as well.

@_date: 2014-12-04 22:40:41
this is great.  if this passes, it would be greatest news.  why didn't we thought of this sooner.  people should have been pushing for moratorium instead of pushing for the regulation.  
internet was regulation-free for a while that allowed innovation to happen.  this is important to allow innovation to happen on bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-29 21:32:00
Weird, why would this getting downvotes?  Is someone trying to manipulate the system?
@_date: 2014-07-29 21:41:52
My take too.  I don't think any of it is reasonable in reality.  These regulations are in fact ridiculous.  
@_date: 2014-08-20 06:08:04
It could actually be a good thing.  Bitcoin businesses will not need to have onerous disabling license like Bitlicense and can innovate freely.  :)
New York Bitlicense is really more like a ban to Bitcoin businesses and make it only possible for banks to do Bitcoin businesses.  Killing all innovation in the process.
@_date: 2014-10-30 09:32:10
exactly.  the solution comes from innovation when many people creates software and the best software wins.

Happy to learn Bitpay has processed 2m euro in Europe in July 2014.

communist states have proves that central planning and regulation is a recipe for disaster.
@_date: 2014-08-28 06:25:06
This is important to note.  
@_date: 2014-08-28 06:11:38
My personal 2 cents.  I think it is wrong for people to be pushing for regulations.  In fact, we should be pushing to delay regulations as much as possible.  Internet was allowed to flourish and grow like wild fire because it is unregulated.  
In 1994, people would not know how to respond to IntLicense because majority of people do not know the benefits.  Same thing for Bitcoin.  We need to wait until majority of people have accepted Bitcoin.

I want to say: "be careful".  That does not mean North Carolina is friendly to Bitcoin.  Money Transmitter license is difficult to obtain.  
@_date: 2014-07-26 17:52:44
Another good excerpt.




@_date: 2014-12-09 10:22:04
The importance of this point could not be overstated.  Currency laws suck.  You don't want to touch those with a 10-foot pole.
@_date: 2014-07-26 18:17:36


Thank you.  That would be my suggestion as well.  The regulations should be fully withdrawn.  
@_date: 2015-08-15 02:47:38
I was really hoping that America would not drive innovation out, but looks like it is doing more and more of that.  
I hope they could erect a moratorium on bitcoin regulation for 5 years to give Bitcoin a chance to show the world what innovation it can actually bring.
@_date: 2015-08-05 14:24:27
Solve the problem with technology and innovation rather than old stifling regulation.  
With crypto to crypto exchange, there is actually ways to build smart contract to make the exchange trustless.  No one can run away with the money unilaterally.  Unfortunately, I do not yet see an trustless exchange yet because it is really difficult to build and the usability does suffers a bit.
With bitcoin/fiat exchange, more innovation is needed as fiat is not easily represented in smart contract.

A lot of times, what is old is new again for computer science.  
eg. software engineering goes from an unstructured development to more structured software engineering process like waterfall.  Now the fashion of the day is agile, a much less structured process.  
eg. after years of threading on server application, node.js server goes back to event-driven loop.  
@_date: 2015-08-04 17:52:58
Stifles the nascent ecosystem that wants to build around bitcoin.  
@_date: 2015-08-07 00:05:39
To be fair, some of these are driven by government regulation.  They are desperate to avoid regulation.  
@_date: 2015-08-13 04:43:37
First off, great work.  
Second, is there any reason of releasing it under AGPL license, which can cause some issue for some people using it.  
Curious to hear the reason, why not uses the more liberal Apache, MIT, and BSD license.  Not to question your choice, just want to hear if there is some consideration about not using Apache, MIT, or BSD.
I was asking because I just saw a discussion on the topic of license in another thread talking about a different lightning implementation.

If we want to look into bitcoin for investment purpose, we probably would search for "bitcoin price" instead of "bitcoin make money".
The result from searching for "bitcoin price" tells a very different story.  The ones searching for "bitcoin price" far outweigh the other terms.
@_date: 2015-08-04 16:19:51
Thank you for the information.  Since its recommendations is for strict AMT/KYC regulations to apply to all Bitcoin exchanges, it is actually a bad news.  A very bad news.
@_date: 2015-08-07 00:41:46
True.  This is closer to reality.
@_date: 2015-04-15 16:06:17
I have to agree.  
They should have pushed for a moratorium instead of pushing for regulation.  
@_date: 2015-04-07 08:41:57
Bitlicense is very negative.
@_date: 2015-03-13 07:53:17
The important point is to allow bitcoin innovation to flourish.  Bitcoin is important because it is the first open transaction network that allows people to build innovation on it.  Using legislation to regulate bitcoin to do only what traditional currency can do is a bit like using legislation to regulate automobile to do only what horse carriage can do.  Just because horse carriage can only do this does not mean we should tell automobile to only do this.
@_date: 2015-03-13 07:58:43
you sound like coinmkt is not around?  is it still around?
@_date: 2015-03-17 07:31:29
This is not good for innovation and growth.  Before this, I was really hoping that Silicon Valley can be the growth hub of bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-12 04:37:47
This sounds like the most horrible news this year.  
I thought California (especially Silicon Valley) is suppose to be the hub of innovation.  Innovation is the engine of growth of Silicon Valley.  And people in California are happy to see this engine of growth.  Why this anti-growth bill.  :(
@_date: 2015-03-14 04:53:56
I'm not upset at you.  I reread what I wrote and don't think my word sounds like I am upset at you.  If anything, I am upset at the politicians.  I am simply pointing out that it would be better for California to promote rather than limiting innovation.
@_date: 2015-03-23 02:30:32
good point
@_date: 2015-11-29 18:28:45
does bitoex.com has some info?  are you looking for english or chinese tutorial?
@_date: 2015-03-12 04:34:37
And this is not bad enough?  
This is actually quite horrible.  A lot of innovation regarding the virtual currency is for using it in various ways beyond simple sale of goods or services.
@_date: 2015-03-14 04:55:39
i see.  indeed.  their website confirmed what you said.  i wonder what it means?

i'm curious, back then, is compressed public key already the norm, or was he still using uncompressed public key.  would that affect his balance retrieval?
@_date: 2015-03-13 07:55:34
That is exactly the point.  Give bitcoin a breathing room to grow for 5 years.  Let it show the world all the wonderful thing people do not imagine before.  Then we can know what are the appropriate regulations for bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-12 04:32:31
coinbase, chain.com, kraken, buttercoin, coinmkt, and many more.
