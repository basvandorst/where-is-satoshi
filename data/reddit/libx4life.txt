You can buy nearly any denomination you like through services like LibertyX, so even if you can't afford a whole bitcoin, you can throw ten bucks at it and watch it grow...throw 15 at it and I would feel confident it would perform better than a $15/oz of silver over time...I sold much of my silver collection on ebay to buy BTC...huge premium on ebay for physical silver plus a much lower BTC price made that a very profitable trade.  I have been under the impression that bitcoin acquisition is the most important move you can make for nearly any portfolio, because if the system simply continues to exist, the price goes up as a matter of math. (Lawyers would like me to remind you this is not investment advice, etc).

Hmm, so they missed on-ramps like the service I work for, LibertyX.  They also seem to have missed the apps like Gyft that allow easy purchase of gift cards with Bitcoin so shopping nearly anywhere is easy with bitcoin...and if you use Lolli to get Bitcoin back on those purchases...you're a pro kid.

I love giving Bitcoin away.  Every time I have I feel great about it...it has done so many things for me I can't help but give back now.  I gave away 0.1 when it represented $10.00 usd, and I commonly give away $5.00 to each employee of the stores I work with that sell Bitcoin.  (I setup retail stores to sell bitcoin, DM me if you own a store)

Have you tried LibertyX?  Thousands of locations in both traditional ATM's and real people cashier locations (some with debit).  Just uncheck "Cash" in our map options and only Debit locations will be displayed

Quite possible, though the folks on this message board today will likely be the ones with the funds to preserve life longer than usual.   and all.

Supply of Bitcoin is limited to a hard cap of 21,000,000 units or full bitcoins.  The production cycle changes every 4 years by cutting in half the number of new coins minted.  The original (genesis block) production value was 50 bitcoins every 10 minutes...four years later that was split in half to 25 bitcoins every 10 minutes, four years later we are where we are today at 12.5 bitcoins produced every 10 minutes.  The next halving brings us to 6.75 and so on and so on until the year 2140 when the run cycle is over and all 21mil are mined...from that point on network fees continue to offer incentive to miners but no new coins are minted.  Does that answer your question, or create more questions?
@_date: 2019-10-16 14:54:38
Run cycle of newly minted BTC ends approx 2140...at which time the fees paid for network transactions actually starts paying more than newly minted coins and keeps the system self-sufficient.
@_date: 2019-10-16 18:32:09
Yes, technically the payout is already higher than 12.5 btc...but not by much so it isn't mentioned a lot, and many of the pools take the transaction fees for operating expenses so most people forget they are even added.
@_date: 2019-10-16 17:12:34
Miners are incentivized via newly minted coins plus the transaction fees paid during that ten minute round.  Take away newly minted coins and you are left with transaction fees.  Well before the year 2140 if the system is still online, use will be exponential and the fees will actually outweigh the new mint in rewarding miners...some new term will be ascribed to this event...maybe a rehashed "the flippening".  Thus well before all bitcoins are created the system will actually be running at a self-sufficient level wherein miners are incentivized more from use than newly minted coins.

Thanks for the awesome review...our customers are why we do this...this guy gets it!
@_date: 2019-06-06 07:00:49
We go where there is business, and we adhere to the full extent of the law as we are required to (higher limits require more verification).  Cash businesses like ours do well where there are cash customers, ie currency exchanges, cell phone stores, etc.  You will find us competing with the Bitcoin ATM's who are in the same markets.  You can find our locations all over the US.  We don't specifically target high crime areas, we do target areas where cash customers exist, those areas often overlap due to circumstances beyond our control and I personally believe I am providing an incredible benefit to the business owner and the community that buys from them by setting up our locations...bitcoin has been the most powerful transformative instrument I have ever had the pleasure of using and I hope to empower the poorest of communities with crypto. I help setup the actual Cash to Crypto infrastructure required to literally bank the unbanked...it has to be cash to truly reach that market.
@_date: 2019-06-06 16:23:51
Above a small amount of money, you will need to request account verification, as is the case with every other compliant exchange.  The thought is criminals won't want to register their names to that, or if they do, and it is traced back to their account, we have that on file (by law).  This is all quite standard, and it was pointed out to me that the gift cards hanging on racks at grocery stores and gas stations pose a far greater risk to laundry exploitation than our services, most criminals still prefer US dollars.

The quintessential "Gilderoy Lockhart" of bitcoin.  Here, this scene is just like what happened...he went on to claim he was Satoshi...it backfired and now he has to pay the estate of Dave Kleiman.

You can be a maximalist and still believe in fiat and other shit-coins being in use...they may be denominated in Bitcoin instead of Dollars though.

Do you use a modern smartphone?  Do you keep it in a steel box for travel, or does it see and hear nearly everything you do 24/7/365?  Video of you using an ATM is really not useful for saying what you did on it  ;)
@_date: 2019-10-03 15:56:40
Try using any version of Coinbase for cash tho.

And then relayed via shortwave to a blockstream satellite node.  Viva la Bitcoin.

Or just select Debit from the map options...some of our cashiers are equipped with debit as well!
@_date: 2019-06-06 18:28:02
Wow...that's weird.  BCH is not BTC.  I find that very odd and totally confusing to anyone not from this industry.  For actual BTC for cash in America, LibertyX is second to none.
@_date: 2019-06-12 05:51:07
50:1 odds say your economics teacher probably used the phrase It's a bubble ad nauseum.
Chuckle...Fiat, it's a bubble.
@_date: 2019-06-06 18:19:46
I setup stores to sell bitcoin for cash for LibertyX...what I do directly enhances the world's ability to bank the unbanked via Bitcoin.  Oh, and LibertyX never holds your funds...we always recommend sending only to a wallet you control the private keys of and we never take custody, the transaction is instantaneous and you will see it in your wallet before you leave the store.
@_date: 2019-06-21 21:59:36
Fees are what they are...I consider the real fiat value of Bitcoin to be whatever I can purchase it at for cash at the lowest price...which is currently the service I work for, LibertyX.  After all, the Unbanked don't generally have a Coinbase account connected to their...you get it.  Out the door cash price is already over 10k.
@_date: 2019-06-21 02:56:51
LibertyX if you're in America, we rock this Ƀ.  I setup the cash stores...DM me if you own a store and want to make cash selling Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-25 03:04:29
LibertyX, we offer both cash and debit bitcoin sales in the US.  Our service is second to none.  We provide the actual infrastructure necessary to bank the unbanked...they pay with cash.
Download our app, bring your own wallet, select the closest location, pay cash or debit and watch the Satoshi's stack in your wallet instantly.  Easiest Bitcoin on the planet.
If you own a store in the US and would like to sell bitcoin with us, please DM me for consideration.
@_date: 2019-06-06 05:47:15
LibertyX is here for your Cash to Crypto needs in the US.  Check our rates, we beat the BTM rates because our footprint is light (we're a phone app).  Plus, we're conveniently located at thousands of retailers across the country, with more locations going live daily.
@_date: 2019-06-21 02:59:33
For me...the chart is entirely red...are we below 1Mil/ea?...is the system still on?...yea, we good...keep buying.
@_date: 2019-10-03 15:11:17
Correct, fees for each store are prominently displayed in the app.  For even easier use...try Edge wallet, which has us integrated under "Buy Crypto", then select cash or debit.
@_date: 2019-06-06 05:34:00
Meanwhile, LibertyX is rolling out new locations in the US like it's our business...because...it's our business. :)
LibertyX.com the best kept secret in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-24 20:24:47
Americans with proper banking services don't typically understand the need for Bitcoin because they have not often experienced a large fluctuation in the value of their currency. 
Anyone that has to stand in line at a currency exchange or use an "Envios de Dinero" like service will quickly understand a currency they can use globally, store on their phone, and has the potential to gain value from a fluctuating rate.  This replaces the need for most traditional banking services and it is my pleasure to work with LibertyX to create the actual infrastructure to bank the unbanked. 
 I setup the cash stores, DM me if you own a store in America and want to cash in on Bitcoin sales with us.
@_date: 2019-06-21 21:55:26
Consider that if your US dollar value has doubled what you put in...it would have just done that with any amount you had invested.
I work with LibertyX, setting up Bitcoin sales from the same guys who sell lottery tickets.  If I'm in store I will pitch Bitcoin to anyone buying lottery explaining you can never lose with Bitcoin, you may lose dollar value temporarily, but the amount of bitcoin stays the same, and if it goes up, you've gained.

Correct, we have quite a few Loves Truck Stops online...though just an FYI, due to station turnover, you may need to educate the teller on how to find it in their menu (instructions can be found on the location page in the LibertyX app).
@_date: 2019-09-19 19:45:31
And for the un-banked...LibertyX is ready for your dirty fiat disposal.  Awesome work Jack, Game On!
@_date: 2019-09-05 16:24:10
If you're in the US...skip that time-loss by using LibertyX to buy real bitcoin from a real store...at the price it is right now.
@_date: 2019-09-11 05:59:39
LibertyX, it's a Bitcoin exchange in a phone app, except you make payments by visiting real brick and mortar businesses that are signed up to sell it for cash.  Sometimes it's inside a regular ATM (debit only).
P.S. If you are reading this and you have a store, PM me or reply here indicating you are interested in selling bitcoin at your store(s) and I'll be in touch.

Trust me I'm lying is a great read about this.  That and Growth Hacker by the same author.  He poses that he helped create the monster that is modern day click-bait journalism...writers don't write to inform, they write to get clicks.  They could be completely backwards on the stance they actually take if they think it will make them more money if the opposite stance is more provocative and will get them more clicks thus earning them more money.  I like how Crypto attacks this with incentivized networks, more like a reddit voting system that actually gets you paid...need to dust off my steemit account for this purpose.
@_date: 2019-09-05 18:15:05
Since LibertyX does not hold funds for customers you don't really move to LibertyX, you move to a real wallet and use LibertyX to buy/load more.
Step one:  Select a real wallet (I like Edge because they added LibertyX inside the wallet, but GreenAddress, BRD, and other real wallets you control the private keys of are fine as well...and/or hardware wallets like Trezor, Keepkey, or Ledger).
Step Two:  Send from Coinbase to your new wallet (copy the receive address and paste into Coinbase).
Extra important to backup your recovery seeds and/or username and password because devices break, but you can recover to a new device with your recovery info and all funds will remain safe.

LibertyX is a part of this party too!
Bitcoin Is\_  (making bitcoin easier to understand)

I hear this often, but did you know that the first thirty years of crypto will be regarded as the early days...and we are only 10 years in.  Download an Edge wallet, visit a local LibertyX retailer, buy 10-20 dollars worth and forget about it or add more each month, week, day, whatever...the goal is accumulation...the math of bitcoin would suggest if it simply continues to exist it will gain in dollar valuation.  Less than 1% of the Earth's population will own a full bitcoin and today they are on bargain super black Friday sale before Wall Street's IPO.  I've seen 10 dollars become 10,000.  I believe we are about to see that again...you are still early AF my friends, buy now and prosper.  (I own bitcoin, lawyer says this is not investment advice, dyor, etc).

Inflation is like an invisible tax.  Bitcoin is deflationary and becomes more scarce over time.  Do you want dollars that go down in value, or Bitcoin that goes up?
