NBA players should wear QR or their QR need to be displayed on screen while mentioned or featured during the broadcasting, so that fans can tip them once in a while when they score big, dunk and block shots~~

yeah right. inflation is like drugs, once u started and tried it out, u find no renson to just stop. because it brings more problems if u stop, and drug addicts usually forget that you won't even be able to have these problems if you never started using drugs in the first place. I'd say, those days are over bitches wake the fuck up, stop using that shit theory FED feed you, cryptocurrency is the cure.

1.for now two verified weibo(Chinese tweeter) account of CEOs of 3rd party payment processor company has said so, but then both deleted the message, because of a massive panic
2.okcoin did cancel caifutong- the tencent payment gateway since yesterday, both deposit and withdraw
3.btcc also removed caifutong deposit gateway. however the withdraw is fine
4. okcoin confirmed the meeting is taking place this afternoon when being asked why take down caifutong. said will make an announcement about the meeting result when it's out.
