Just make her an account on coinbase and you can sell them there. Money goes directly to the debit card

@_date: 2014-02-18 21:06:10
@_date: 2014-04-15 16:35:21
if you dont have enough of it and want to short sell it. that's what i get from it. also they have an investor window in there where you can be the one lending it out from my understanding 
@_date: 2014-04-15 15:05:09
Worst case you would lose half of it or more and endure a lot of stress.
the best advice they give on r/bitcoin is to not invest more than you are willing to lose
@_date: 2014-11-12 21:50:41
sound logic
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:34:52
great insight
@_date: 2014-04-15 15:12:25
im saying worst case scenario, i doubt that it will ever drop to 0 but if you are slowly bleeding monday for a month a lot of people go into panic and sell
@_date: 2014-01-31 18:42:54
that just sounds idiotic, who issues their statements
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:10:21
haha yeah that font is a joke
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:14:55
i agree yolo swagzzzzzzz
@_date: 2014-03-06 16:05:13
I know lol, im just at work 
@_date: 2014-03-05 19:33:08
This is amazing, i am a fan boy of this guy now
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:19:44
lol do you read b4 you post.....
@_date: 2014-04-15 15:42:45
I agree, but I just dont see it dropping to 0 overnight, worst case set up sell orders at certain pts, like if he loses 50% (or whatever % he decies) then take the loses and go home
@_date: 2014-04-15 16:35:44
No idea, i want to hear a success story before i jump on board
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:49:14
that will be so annoying to heard because the ignorant people will keep saying that
@_date: 2014-04-15 20:22:57
who have you heard this from, I havent seen anyone that has used it
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:14:04
prices are low people wanna buy. EZ
@_date: 2014-02-26 15:23:04
You summarized that perfectly
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:13:04
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:49:35
i watched and this was wondering how this guy supposedly is an expert and investing and can be this ignorant about bitcoin
@_date: 2014-03-12 18:04:06
I did not see that. yes 9% is very steep that's almost absurd
@_date: 2014-04-16 13:39:47
I see, so can the scammers just run out with out any repercussions 
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:41:47
I know, it's just really frustrating because for people that were on the fence about bitcoin or only read headlines, now are super uninformed and will most likely shy away
@_date: 2014-03-24 19:27:22
It is behind the counter. As long as you have an account with them they will do it for free. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 20:37:41
This needs to change
@_date: 2014-03-20 15:56:34
hahahahha thats perfect
@_date: 2014-02-18 20:55:43
ummmmmmmm can we make this happen lets stop whacking off n do work
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:28:06
2 thumbs up
@_date: 2014-02-18 21:07:19
I do agree with that, but that turn people off as the value will see small. I don't want people to be saying omg bitcoin was worth 1000 dollars at one point and now it is 1 if were gonna have mBTC as a standard. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 17:17:58
Has anyone used this. This seems like a great idea, You can buy anything from any online site as long as you submit the link that it is posted on and they order it for you. You can pay with Bitcoin, litecoin, dogecoin.
@_date: 2014-02-26 14:54:40
eh, i like my scenario better
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:32:44
in my opinion that's exactly what happened
@_date: 2014-02-24 21:34:19
I do agree with it being excessive. There is no way they need that many to start, but i guess its better this than none
@_date: 2014-01-30 17:40:49
BRO, peanut butter aint a brand
@_date: 2014-03-24 17:37:06
Most banks have their own coinstart like machine and does it free of charge
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:18:23
not a lot of people are selling 35 grand of bit coin in person
