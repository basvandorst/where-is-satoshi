Friedrich Nietzsche once said, “The snake which cannot cast its skin has to die.” and this couldn’t hold more truth for the Indian IT industry and the current challenges it needs to overcome.
The largest Indian IT companies, including Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys and Wipro are now investing in and evaluating new technologies, one of which is block chain technology, the underlying technology of the digital currency bitcoin.

1) it's coverage for the transaction when we do the trade with genesis up to 1 million. That's is. We are not insuring bitcoin at all. 
1a) If you are serious. I am sure we can show you a policy number or whatever you need to be assured. 
2) Yes. Most do
3) Yes. You can. You are not stuck. In fact we can get your money to you in a day. Also you can remove the bitcoin for up to 60 days and as long as it is returned you will not pay taxes. 
3a)We use Genesis and quote the price while you are on the phone.

We charge a fee upfront. This WSJ article explains: 
@_date: 2017-01-16 22:29:36
* Once the account is established with our custodian (Kingdom Trust) we purchase the bitcoin through our liquidity partner Genesis trading. 
* Three keys are generated and kept in cold storage. One at Kingdom Trust’s certified and insured vault. The second at Brinks certified and insured depository, and the third at KeyTurnAllRecoveryServices.
* To perform any transaction two of those keys have to be taken out of cold storage and verified at the same time.
* The IRA owner has viewing privileges of its Bitgo wallet and has access to the public wallet address to verify its bitcoin content at any time with blockchain.info or any other company. 
* BitcoinIRA has $1 million Consumer Protection insurance policy with Lloyds of London that protects us on the transactional side.

Strategic Proposal March 5, 2015
At the end of the year the Foundation faced some significant challenges: 
 Poor reputation 
 Declining membership 
 Falling bitcoin prices 
 Very bad balance sheet 
 January 2014 close – $5.2mm 
 January 2015 close – $463k 
 In spite of this we have made significant progress in turning around the financial situation with consistent month/month revenue growth and declines in operating loss 
 There is an outside chance that March could be the Foundation’s first cash-flow positive month since the earliest days of the Foundation 
 The Foundation’s reputation has been steadily improving in the business community although some uncertainty remains due to Board elections 
 However, despite improvement in the business processes and functioning of the organization there are some remaining structural challenges that may prove insurmountable without some fundamental changes to the organization Current situation

That would be a great first step and would even push me in the direction of becoming a paid member. Let's see Bruce, you just might be able to turn this around. 
I would also look at your paying member companies. Some of them just don't stand up to scrutiny. Will send you my concerns via email. 
Good luck, and please 8,888 bits for your efforts @_date: 2015-04-09 13:27:14

I have been struggling to get port 8333 open all year, I gave up and was using blockchain for months despite a strong desire to stay on Bitcoin Core, but now the issue has reached critical mass since I'm using the python Bitcoin server module. I have literally spent my entire day trying to open 8333, I thoroughly made sure it was open on the router and computer and it's still closed. Strangely enough I got it open for 30 seconds once today but something closed it immediately.
After hours of phone calls and messaging AT&amp;T finally told me the truth of what was going on, and only because I noticed it myself and demanded an answer. The internet is being routed through a DVR/cable box, and they confirmed the DVR also has a firewall. To make this even more absurd they refused to turn the firewall off because it is their equipment. So effectively they can firewall any port they want even if the customer asks them not to, in the unlikely event the customer figures it out.
Perhaps this is the driving force behind the inexplicable and massive decline in Bitcoin nodes. Bitcoin is being censored by the ISPs themselves, and they won't even tell you that. I had to get in touch with headquarters and threaten to rip it out of the wall to get a proper answer.

no they are not. it serves them no purpose. they want to make money just like everyone else. another asset class is more money for them. 
who even knows what the price should be? for all i know it could be worth $10. it doesn't matter, the tech is so valuable and that is not going anywhere. 
bitcoin is here to stay forever and we are so early in its birth

Bitcoin mining chips are stupid, they are meant to do one thing only so you can't compare it a chip that can do a bunch of different things.
A NASCAR racing car is stripped down, so safety, mirrors, etc.. because it is built for one thing only. to go super fast round and round but a Maybach is just as powerful and fast?
Interesting. I have read this comparison made before on a bunch of articles and forum posts so I thought it would be ok to make. I am not an expert on this. 
what you are saying makes sense to me. but the $4 billion on ASIC miners number doesn't sound right though. mind doing some back of the envelope math for me?
you can insert a tab in this bitcoin mining spreadsheet from almost a year ago:

Thanks bro. We probably shouldn't have expressed the data in petaFlops which is a different calculation.  We used  for this, in hindsight, it would have been better to reference petahashes, thank you for the comment.
