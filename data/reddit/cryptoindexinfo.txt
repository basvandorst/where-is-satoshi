not an expert by any means but this is my best guess.
The tether foundation would only be incentivised to buy tokens when one tether + transaction fee's is less than $1.00 USD.
Tether has NOT been less than a $1 for awhile, it has been trading at a premium, so the tether foundation hasn't been buying any back.
When the token is less then a dollar they buy them back and burn them. This clears their "debt".
A tether token is debt. When tether tokens are &lt; $1 the tether foundation buys them back and burns them.  Buying a token for $.95 to burn a debt of $1 is a 5% profit.

Great idea.  Can you let us all know right before that happens?
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:43:27
he is trying to say it went up because of tether - which the FUD point of view is fake money.

Great quote but remember investing recklessly is a great way to lose money in your sleep as well.
There is no such thing as easy money.

well that's pretty terrible then.  I haven't really looked into it myself as I am not interested in using it but if that's true it seems like a pretty big scam

Bitcoin in it's current iteration is showing weakness to a 0 tx spam attack.
The protocol is still young and the protocol will need to be tweaked.
@_date: 2017-11-20 09:51:09
it will probably be okay. I wouldn't hold your life saving in there though.

miners sell the btc they make from fee's back to the market... this is how they make money..

congrats on being debt free!  that should be everyone's goal. Glad to see you are going to buy back in at some point.  This ride can be fun even if you are holding just a little!

it's basically cryptocurrency that is backed by the US Dollar.
Basically for every tether crypto coin created, the company that runs tether holds $1 US dollar.  They will always pay you $1 for a tether (minus fee's).
This is not an "investment" coin.. it is usually used by people who think bitcoin is going to drop so they convert to tether and then wait for a dip.

because there is still FUD in the air.
Also, contrary to popular believe, some people don't follow the meme war and have no idea wtf is happening
@_date: 2017-11-20 09:58:12
this whole subreddit is mostly memes, are you surprised?

Actually after a recession hits traditional stocks are usually a great investment since most of them just tanked and have nowhere to go but up.  Usually only those who are already wealthy will be able to buy in though as average joe loses his job during a recession.

Well, it is only 7x smaller than Apple..
Think about how many lives Apple has affected.  iPhones are everywhere, even third world countries.
I'm actually surprised how close it is in valuation considering how little of the population even know what Bitcoin is.

Honestly it's why I think we will have crypto "banks" in the future.
People losing private keys by getting hacked, forgetting their passwords, or death is going to be in the billions.
I know it pushes away from "decentralization", but I think most people that hold BTC would be safer having their PK handled by an insured institution.   Those who are comfortable with the risks won't need them of course.
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:06:55
It's hard to say.  It depends on what the recession is.  Usually a recession means that people are money hungry - they aren't investing - they are liquidating EVERYTHING. Stocks, real-estate etc.  You can bet that average joe would be selling his bitcoin to keep a roof over his head.. but then again does average joe even own bitcoin?
I think it really depends on the demographic of people that own bitcoin when the recession hits.

I run a crypto related website.
My traffic from Africa is
Nigeria &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ghana &gt; Morocco/Uganda/ South Africa.  
No traffic from the rest of the country.

In investing, probably yes.
The crypto market is a zero sum game. There are going to be some big winners, but a lot more losers.
The average investor is a lemming that follows others... buying high and selling low.

Do you really think these brothers are wanting to "buy in cheaper"
They have been in the game since 2011.. They have thousands of coins. I doubt they are buying more.
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:45:22
you are correct.
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:45:22

Or it's like any other news outlet that just wants more clicks/views.
Not everything is a conspiracy. They want more clicks, controversial articles get the most views.

Obviously people, banks and news outlets collude in this unregulated market but just because it happens doesn't mean everything is a planned and targeted attack.

Past history is no indication of future performance.
Bitcoin is not on a "discount" right now. 9K could be it's true price.  Maybe it will be 40k by the end of the year... maybe 1k.
You, me, not nobody knows what's going to happen next.  It's just a game of probabilities. We weigh those probabilities into how much we are willing to risk.
Good luck kids.  Remember to only risk what you are willing to lose.. but also remember you need to take some risk in life... crypto also isn't the only option for investment.
