Yea i guess that would be bitcoin day trading method if anything. Big gamble.
Im hodl anyway but a strategy I was thinking about.
@_date: 2019-11-22 13:05:24
That’s the hustle 
You don’t know where tf the market is going.
Something I noticed to gain more coin off your 1 without spending more then your initial investment..
@_date: 2019-11-22 13:07:00
Yes it would infact be a current loss
But it will mature with 2 coins instead of 1
@_date: 2019-11-22 13:30:07
This is nuts.
@_date: 2019-11-22 12:38:07
Your gonna HODL till you get yours back, it’s like severely investing an investment?
@_date: 2019-11-22 13:14:19
I’m fully vested in our future.
I’m just saying within the next 3 months of investing
@_date: 2019-11-22 12:50:46
I’m more or so looking at the term investing your investments.
@_date: 2019-11-22 13:34:50
Yes. 
If 1 coin reached 10,000 you get 10,000
If 2.3 coins reach 10,000
You get....
Your 10,000 is still gotta be returned but now you are able to return at multiples.
BUT I LOVE MY COINS AND I’M NOT SELLING ME COINS.
but it was my days thought.

This is only temporary.
What happens since this is so unregulated and wild west that someone makes a fake set up and they undermine starbucks.
Starbucks uses a single vendor to ensure the background is understood.
We both know if you say you accept all bitcoin at a well known place like that it will get fucked with.
@_date: 2019-11-22 02:49:15
I feel that pressure
@_date: 2019-11-22 12:57:33
Maybe i’m retarted then.
If one is coin at 10,000 and It is sold at 7,000 how much do I get in my account?
7,000 - fee right?
If one coin is at 10,000 and it is sold at 3,000,
How much do I get in my account?
3,000 - fee
So i’m saying 
10,000 coin fell to 7,000 
If the money was at that time needed you have suffered a 3,000 dollar loss... current numbers.
You have spent 10,000 on 1 coin 
You cashed your coin at 7,000 
You took the 3,000 loss.
Bitcoin now drops to 3,000
You use the 7,000 to buy at the 3,000 price
Now you have more coin
And when the bubble pops you now invest in multiple coins instead of 1 10,000 coin.
@_date: 2019-11-22 13:00:46
It’s just multiplying your already said bought coins
@_date: 2019-11-22 12:49:57
Well yeah I would agree there, if the investor had more money to pump into it at that point.
You would think they would if they invested in a 18k coin or so.
@_date: 2019-11-22 12:59:52
More coins is more return on a bubble?
@_date: 2019-11-22 12:41:31
Yea i’m just thinking crazy man.
It’s going to drop apparently.
So why not let it drop on it’s own while you could just recoup whatever you can from it before it hits the bottom.
Then since we saved the inevitable bottom at a higher price, We can buy multiple coins vs keeping 1 coin at 10,000
@_date: 2019-11-22 12:43:38
Also it “was” a 10,000 dollar coin, right now it’s a 7,000 coin possible 3,000 coin.
I just smoked a joint and was just thinking i have a few coins at different levels of the game.
@_date: 2019-11-22 13:31:11
I appreciate you man
@_date: 2019-11-15 23:52:50
@_date: 2019-11-22 13:03:22
Lol dude I agree 
No shit lol buy at a lower price
I’m already doing that
I’m just thinking about opportunities
@_date: 2019-11-22 21:55:11
I mean just today alone if I sold when i was talking about this at  7,700 and bought at 6,900 i flipped  1 to 1.3 coin in 8 hours tops.
@_date: 2019-10-30 14:36:05
Wtf
