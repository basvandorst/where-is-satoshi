What if the fees are so cheap the volatility your bots create dwarfs the fees?

Been invested in crypto since Thanksgiving and even after the recent downturn I am still 3x.  My 401k has never done that.... Adios.

I think they are based out of NY and and because they hold USD are subject to all the banking regs per fed and states (which is why they are so serious about who you are and what state you live in &lt;taxes and regulation&gt;).  I don't think they are FDIC insured but are held to a higher standard.  If they lost your money (USD), I think you could legitmately sue them.  Crypto... not sure there.  So they are a very "safe" options for americans to use however their books will be accessible by feds and states, so make sure you pay your taxes...

Zero problems here and it's USA based so if they screw you, you can hire a lawyer.  Not fdic insured but bonded I think.

They could try but with VPN and proxy it's impossible.  They can't stop some crazy nasty stuff now... They could try and ban encrypted traffic but that would end all security and turn us into North Korea. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:47:31
bch was added to the gdax exchange and coinbase.  lots of of big money going in before that (publically).  We have full on fomo going on.

Twas a joke.  The day landlords are accepting cryptocurrency all the hodlers be rich.  Cheers to that day. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:48:55
For future reference can you link to their public document that gave the time and date that the coin would be added.  I wanna try to get in on it next time. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:37:42
13 States don't allow Coinbase to USD.  I also can't use GDAX.  Here are the states that do.

Wow you must have some friends at coinbase.  How's it feel to be on the inside?  Kinda shitty out here on the edge.

Been getting random server timeouts on console.  Also times on android app.  im guessing they are all hands on deck over there as they clearly planned this shit show out.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:13:22
I see a tweet 14 hours ago which is when they added it to their app.  Before that I see them responding to someone on the december 14th.  I don't see any official release of that time and date prior to it showing up in my app.  Maybe screen shot? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:35:06
But if you want to sell BTC and move it back in to USD so you can invest later, is there a way to do that quickly?  Wire transfers and all that take time... and then I think you run into bankers hours (say I want to do this at 3am on Sunday)...
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:59:39
You mean BCH is booming?  Yeah, this specific night is a strange time to make your first buy.  I'd let the dust settle... or jump in head first.  Do a quick google search tons of good articles/arguments out there.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:31:13
I haven't been screwed but could have (was too late to the dance).  Been waiting for coinbase to announce their next coin.  All I heard of was months back that bch would be in by the 1st.  All of a sudden I log into the app and they are adding that coin.  Mean while in the previous weeks you seen people publicly going in and the price pumping.  Coincidence?
Insider trading is the trading of a public company's stock or other securities (such as bonds or stock options) by individuals with access to nonpublic information about the company.
IT ERODES TRUST IN THE SYSTEM.  It confirms what everybody believes.  The game is rigged.  That's not to say you can't make a buck,   but only as much as they let you. 
I sat on the sidelines of crypto to long.  Was more interested in the tech than the money.  I should have been more interested in the money.  So yeah I may be a little butt hurt.

any idea when the buy/sell will be enabled?

I think it is how they did that is annoying me.

Yeah, so I can only really speak to my experience I guess.    If you live in MN coinbase won't allow you to use their USD Wallet.  Your options are Bank Transfer or CC as far as I have been told.  As far as using GDAX they won't let MN residents use it all together.  Their apps explicated told me this but also reached out to them.  I was also told that they only had deals with 37 states.  So the other 13 were on the outs.  
With that said MN is really the only one I have any first hand info about.  I did find one note on their page that says that the GDAX restriction "US states not yet supported by GDAX include: Wyoming, Hawaii, and Minnesota."  and it may simply be that the USD Wallet is the 13 state restriction (as I think the minute you start storing USD for people you have to comply with banking reg's in each state).  So if you are from MN this may be helpful info, if not then maybe not so much.
