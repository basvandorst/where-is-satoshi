If a map service could tie a merchant wallet address and thus update their map with how many days since last transaction.
I think bitpay and coinbase generate new address for each transaction, but I think it is better for the merchants accounting to have one input address.

If you send the payment to a dish/coinbase generated payment address, it should register at some point.
I have made large payments to a similarly generated payment address and forgot to include a transaction fee. Even though the merchant said payment must be send within 15 minutes, it took a full 24 hours for the transaction to be included in a block, before it registered with the merchant as a payment.
My point is, payment address stay active for some time and if a payment was sent to it, it will a eventually register.
Now I do not have knowledge as to how Dish received payment motivations, but it would never be instant in any case as the first confirmation can take 5-30 minutes with a transaction fee, plus they may require x# to confirm. Your computer restarting with have nothing to do with this process.

Merchant adoption has increased, faster than consumer adoption. Merchants selling daily, without consumers buying daily, has created this downward trend.
As merchant change reserves, started becoming the consumer through reuse of the coins, and consumers find it easy and easy to aquire coins, the trend with swing the other way.
At the moment cheaper coins is better for consumer adoption anyway.

This implies most miners sell to "realize gross profit", but considering miners reinvest in more mining equipment, which is purchased with bitcoin, I do not see miner sales driving down the price.
Now some recent miner farms build with borrowed capital do have to sell to service the debt, but I am not sure what percentage of the industry is build on debt and which is build on early adopter capital.
Finally, the exchange value of bitcoin is not relevant. Miners purchase equipment with btc and are rewarded in btc. Equipment is price based on likely reward based on difficult predictions and not market forces.

NN would allow more censorship of "undesirable" or "unlawful" content at the ISP level. So they could cut bitcoin off at the port level or filter it out with packet sniffing. The thing is ISP could do this now, but with NN the government/lobbyist could force all ISPs to do it. Either way, bitcoin will survive as it is bigger than the US and can easy change its code to get around any targeted attack.

It is possible the amount of the transaction has some weight in whether miners include it for free or not. The transaction I was speaking of was 0.999 BTC. So it is possible for a transaction to nor be included or be included in an orphaned block and return unspend, but I still think some miner will stick it in to fill out a block.
