Could be an error my friend I don’t know if I trust the security methods when it comes to giving my money to someone.  Regardless if I’m fearful imagine the rest of the population.  Nice theory but it definitely won’t happen.
@_date: 2019-07-29 19:22:12
Hey do you accept this online currency that you need a e wallet for and where you will lose some of the original value but also you will need to wait 30 minutes for and I could have accidentally fat fingered your bitcoin address so you won’t get anything at all
@_date: 2019-07-29 11:57:52
What people like doesn’t matter to me.  You’re speaking for everybody and I don’t agree with what you are saying so I made a comment about it.
@_date: 2019-07-30 09:39:04
Dude were talking about the exchange here.... whatever happens after the money is transferred is at risk by the cashier.
@_date: 2019-07-19 12:17:24
I’m sure the people who bought low and sold at 19k are pretty happy right now
@_date: 2019-07-29 19:55:24
No it’s literally just handing over a piece of paper....
@_date: 2019-07-29 11:49:01
You can’t speak for everybody buddy stop taking personal experiences as some moral lesson we all need to know.
@_date: 2019-07-10 00:11:26
Bitcoin has huge potential for investment; I’ll give it that, but saying it’s the future with no real basis is just stupid.
@_date: 2019-07-18 22:51:34
It’s not just the product it’s the environment it’s in.
@_date: 2018-08-06 17:51:24
Y would u ever sell it at a dollar if u made more than 10x your money in a year? If u think about it thats ridiculuous to sell at that time because common sense will tell you its popularity will probably go even higher in the coming years.
@_date: 2018-08-08 18:26:55
Says who
@_date: 2018-06-17 07:51:39
Ok Mr. I kissed a transexual and now wants to stalk people who tried helping.  
@_date: 2018-06-17 08:04:05
Lol right....u kissed a man.
@_date: 2019-08-19 10:39:01
Most likely they are gone.  You’d have to email the support team to see if your bitcoins can be compensated for.  I think you may get half value.
@_date: 2019-08-30 15:06:00
Obviously my point was clearly misunderstood.  Gonna have to ignore notifications on this.  But no hate op I agree with u.
@_date: 2019-08-13 12:42:07
I hope he rebought at 8 otherwise he’s a fucking moron
@_date: 2019-08-29 15:27:04
I’m sorry but I cannot take financial advice from someone who has that many visible tattoos seriously.  The artwork is cool but coming off as professional is the better way to gain someone’s trust.  But do you man no hate.
@_date: 2018-06-16 20:39:25
Peoppe said bitcoin wouldnt fall below 8k at one point....
@_date: 2018-06-17 05:58:12
Your prediction shows how well you use yours.
@_date: 2019-08-28 12:06:00
Bitcoin signs are just edgy
@_date: 2019-08-23 15:04:21
More of just a hilarious comment then any kind of explanation
@_date: 2018-06-27 20:59:18
I wish i could live long enough to even see 2100
@_date: 2019-08-14 10:25:03
So you wrote that in huh?
@_date: 2018-06-30 13:22:30
So you3re gonna compare a 6 month statistic with a bunch of &lt;1 months? Ok...
@_date: 2018-06-16 22:36:56
I have no doubt santa claus is real
@_date: 2018-06-21 19:28:15
I feel like this sub is made up of young adults aged 21-30 who think they are financial gurus.
@_date: 2019-08-20 16:12:08
@_date: 2019-08-21 11:06:24
Am I the only one noticing how thick that Indian girl is?
@_date: 2018-06-23 02:07:56
If you sold at 19k u the smartest mother fucker that ever existed
@_date: 2019-08-05 19:01:56
How is this relevant to the sub again?
@_date: 2019-08-19 18:02:29
Ah you might be out of luck then, sorry.
@_date: 2019-08-11 09:31:29
If you follow the blocks its only 3 the 4th is merged
@_date: 2019-08-30 15:46:28
Without dip they saved 50% with what they started off with.  Just like buying at 19k and not buying at 10k later  so you don’t lose value from your original investment.
@_date: 2018-06-22 18:55:10
@_date: 2019-08-22 09:40:55
Just like this.... and yes I will let everyone know how attractive I think females are because they are much more important than a stupid internet currency
@_date: 2019-06-23 13:46:39
Wait this is targeted towards all the people who invested starting 2017 right?
@_date: 2019-08-13 12:43:46
20 dollars will get u 2 gallons of milk and 2 boxes of cereal...200 maybe?
@_date: 2019-06-17 13:54:53
I’ll take your daughters advice, can you pick me out some good holding music?
@_date: 2018-06-25 10:25:28
Thats just my life expectations vs reality
@_date: 2018-06-17 00:16:43
Right.  Im confused.
@_date: 2019-06-04 15:27:04
How is it possible he got that much velocity from a small drop?
@_date: 2019-06-04 15:08:14
I woulda got out at 10k if I was in to begin with.  The false hope is why I am on this sub.  You guys are hilarious.
@_date: 2019-08-19 09:46:34
Please do not keep your bitcoins in marketplaces as they frequently shut down and you won’t be refunded.  Download electrum wallet and create a profile.  From there you will have a bitcoin receiving and withdrawing address.  You use the receiving address to tunnel the money from being held in an online wallet to a cold one that is permanently on your hard drive.
@_date: 2019-06-04 15:09:37
Nice.  How long did it take you?
@_date: 2019-06-25 14:15:56
All aboard the hype train
@_date: 2019-06-19 15:01:32
More like competing with 
@_date: 2018-07-02 16:43:38
When people invest in crypto...
@_date: 2018-07-11 00:05:15
Its actually better to get in a reputable alt coin at this time.  Youll make much more profits off an altcoin when bitcoin goes back up.
@_date: 2019-09-02 18:31:47
All these early investors preaching so idiots in this sub can keep buying to raise up the value.  Lemme guess another -10 for my unthoughtful post.
@_date: 2019-09-20 11:27:35
They are just being nice.  No business will accept currency that can be inflated or deflated in the matter of seconds.
@_date: 2019-09-28 23:59:32
Where the fuck did u shop where 20 bucks gets u a full cart of groceries?
@_date: 2019-05-27 13:31:20
You’re such a tool....
@_date: 2019-05-25 13:33:52
The irony
@_date: 2019-05-24 11:45:39
Plot twist: they actually run a drug cartel and are using lemonade to launder drug money.
@_date: 2019-05-05 13:24:00
Bread more in shape than me :(
@_date: 2019-05-27 13:56:38
Yeah let me just take $1 now instead of $9000
