Spatial reasoning
Men are *generally* better at these things. Studies have been done. Do not deny human nature. 
Tolerance 
Women are *generally* better at these things. 
Obviously women do have a place in the emergence of bitcoin, but I would argue it is not *generally* as early adopters, protocol hacker debaters, wallet developers. The women will be valuable in the public relations, social media, sales(as in payment processors to small businesses).
PC police please note my use of generally, there are always some men who are pansy ass fags and some women who are square jawed ball crusher traders.

I read the FAQ. 
Yes, coin validation wants to tie coins to individuals. 
You are not technically black or whitelisting coins but easy for regulators to black or whitelist *individuals* using your proto-evil
Shrivel and die.

You should find a medium size miner to get in with. They need $us or € for elec etc.

Mining and achieving a block by the IRS rules counts as income at the time it is received.

As most estimates on here are showing at least multiple days for even up to amazon c3 32 vcpu, I think maybe you do not have right code for checking if already done. Care to share?

If he is discovered I assume the irs will penalize him for fraud for not reporting an accurate return.

The way I understand it, you owe tax as soon as you mine it

It had never ever been traded to usd before so how do you determine pennies?

Right from his page
I delivered the keynote speech, on smart contracts, at the IEEE International Workshop on Electronic Contracting (WEC), San Diego, California, USA on July 6, 2004. Here are the slides from that talk.

Bitcoin "miners," people who use special software to solve math problems and generate Bitcoin, must include the value of any Bitcoin they mine as part of their gross income, the IRS said. Miners must also pay self-employment taxes if they are operating as a Bitcoin-generating business, the IRS said.

He gets it.

If I have a mining setup that uses 2000 in electricity and per month but I never actually solve a block, this is a loss?

Imagine coin validation as a vendor installing scanners at every bank and ATM and hashing your social security number with every every bill you deposit or withdraw and a time stamp. Where do you think this data will find utility?
No reason for us to support that as a community.

Still doubt method If you say you checked a billion since this was posted.

And then the regulatory agency says if you accept bitcoin from this list of individuals your business license/whatever permit will be revoked.

Looked at code, basically just one file python script, and it looks fine.  No outward calls or anything. 
The only attack vector really is if he updates it later with something nefarious and you pull it again. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 00:01:12
Not really. He already said it was recently added words which brings it down to between 9000 and 16000 words depending how far you want to go back for recent. 
Op also stated all lower case and all ASCII and not obscure words and no spaces. Also all three words are different so check for that in code to make more efficient. 
So about 10000 words and you can start with the middle length and most common if you want to plug some frequency data for words from somewhere.

Supposedly all f the people who have taught him or taken one of his classes.

Get some musical artist that is a little loopy to only sell tickets via bitcoin. Or maybe a music festival could do it.

I agree, this is the most odious and wrong of the new rules.

From what I read, If you mine, it is counted as a business and if you achieve a block it is counted as income at athat time at that times fmv

Pretty sure cdm9002 is staying at 18 length, he was just trying middle sized numbers first for a reduced space. 
@_date: 2014-06-27 23:23:26
Your information will be hashed with a bitcoin address, so basically your bitcoin address will become like a social security number or license number to prove who you are.

Sounds like bitpesa right next door in Kenya needs to expand to Uganda.

You are still supplying ground level data for someone that might want to blacklist individual hashes of kyc data. 
Regulatory agencies are boxes, you are forced to think inside them.
