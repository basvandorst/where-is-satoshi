yeah... I guess because some people are scammers that means the rest of us need to pay the consequence.
I just wish there was an easier way to turn my USD into BTC.  The worst part of getting into bitcoin is the week of anticipation waiting for my bitcoin to appear in my wallet

**a feeling of irritation or resentment resulting from a slight, especially to one's pride.**
no, that's not what I meant at all.. I meant that it peaked my interested, as in it made me think that was interesting....
your attempts at lingual gymnastics have been plundered.  take a knee

no problem man!  you gave me some insight.  That's worth my 2 cents ;)
@_date: 2015-01-03 02:47:22
all I have is "My Wallet", "My Vault", "Buy/Sell", "Merchants", "Tools"...
I'm guessing my state doesn't "qualify" :/
@_date: 2015-01-03 04:34:19
lol!  sorry, I didn't see your post!
@_date: 2015-01-03 05:04:14
cool.  Yeah, the 4 business days problem is a bank issue, but if that's the only way to get bitcoin.... then the problem kind of rolls in on itself.
I'll check out Circle.  that seems to be the main response I'm getting.

To clarify:
1) the selfish reason:  I only buy like $10-$30 USD of BTC at a time... I feel like the "fees" as small as they are aren't worth it because of my small purchase amount.  I'd rather pay that directly to a fellow "bitcoiner"/redditor
2) the altruistic reason:   IDK if this is just me having "half baked thoughts" or if it is a half decent idea.....   If there was some way for people to more or less "instantly" purchase small amounts of bitcoin, there would probably get more people willing to learn the technology/currency.  (Also, young people don't have hundreds or thousands of dollars to spend, they have "tens" of dollars).  I wish I knew enough about this currency to know if this was a good or a shitty idea and maybe lead the way to heading up a sub for "entry level small time bitcoin buys".   Hell, the first person to PM me because of this message, that wants to buy $5 worth of BTC, mention the keyword "hamburger", and I'll give you 0.0175 for $5  ($5.45 per google "btc price" at the time of posting")

Either way, are you seriously arguing spelling of a word?

good on you... i'm not about to argue linguistic semantics... if I wasn't so drunk I'm pretty sure I could refute you... But, it is a Friday night and I'm having fun with my friends.... I suggest you do the same!!!

I think I tried signing up for trucoin before, but they wanted a utility bill in my name, and none of the utils in my apartment are in my name, so I couldn't confirm the acct :/
@_date: 2015-01-03 02:42:12
this is the first I am hearing of this... is that paypal thing?  I haven't used my PayPal in years... but I figure it is faster than what Coinbase takes.  
I'm an impulse buyer.
@_date: 2015-01-03 02:34:59
so there is no way to escape the week long wait for USD to become BTC?
@_date: 2015-01-03 02:59:36
i'm game if you are cool with waiting until the btc transfer is confirmed and I have complete control over them....  otherwise, how do i know you aren't a scammer?
@_date: 2015-01-03 03:07:58
yeah, especially for something potentially sketchy...... $10 USD tops
@_date: 2015-01-03 05:09:44
WAIT!  why is this getting downvoted?!?!?!?!?!?!
as a noob, this all seems just as plausible as everything else I read....
@_date: 2015-01-03 05:32:17
yeah... I get that... I subscribed to but pretty much every post goes over my head/I'm not up to speed on what is going on.
Apparently, I'm supposed to hate some guy named Josh Garza or something like that.  I have no idea why, but we all seem to be picking up the pitchforks!
@_date: 2015-01-03 05:48:10
apparently I can't verify there either....
My license still has my parent's address because it hasn't expired yet..... it doesn't match my current address....
This is all stuff that needs to be considered for bitcoin adaptation.... you want the youngsters...... but this type of verification doesn't work easy for people like that!
