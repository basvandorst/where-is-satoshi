I believe these additional security measures are being taken because of the new KYC (know your customer )and AML (anti money laundering) regulations . ..all to be expected when moving money through traditional banking systems

Well put! In the end it's all about the jurisdiction of the currency. There's another good way to communicate this situation that I heard about recently on this video  (Which is F*ing HILARIOUS BTW lol) Basically states the economy be deflationary, inflationary and stationary at the same time, depending on the type of currency in question and how it's being used...via traditional  , or  ,etc...

Yes it's pretty important to mention that bitcoin is not just decentralized but also deflationary

That's right we don't spend our bitcoin on drugs , we use cash for that lol

Quibble you may but I think deflationary is accurate, since there are a limited number of Bitcoin that will ever be created...
Your comment did make me stop and think though, I appreciate that . I actually had to Google what the word meant just to be sure lol...
