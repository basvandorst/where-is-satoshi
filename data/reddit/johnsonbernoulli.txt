I am sorry the website has a bug, and there are two message can not display correctly, I am fixing the bug now
@_date: 2015-08-12 14:19:47
NO, I didn't use OP_RETURN.
I have compared different method. 
OP_RETURN is not the best way.
I use a multi-sig transaction to save message
@_date: 2015-08-12 14:50:12
I will make website more beautiful...
@_date: 2015-08-12 23:27:24
Aha， it's a good idea

Q: Should I search by private key?
A: No. I log and steal everything.
@_date: 2015-09-09 14:25:11

the media always want to make a "big news", and always say lies.
@_date: 2015-09-09 14:20:20
aha, good example
@_date: 2015-09-12 12:00:55
contracts ? ether ? or some other ?
@_date: 2015-09-09 23:31:28
yes, you have to write code to send this
@_date: 2015-09-09 22:55:02
If you mean lots of A-G C-T， I think it's OK
@_date: 2015-09-23 23:32:36
yes, It needs years
@_date: 2015-09-12 16:07:25
It's too difficult...
@_date: 2015-09-24 13:53:43
maybe ，I pay only 0.0001 for fee
@_date: 2015-09-13 14:03:39
just a phrase, because the information will be write on block chain in a multi-sig transaction
@_date: 2015-09-13 01:00:21
distribute book is easy, you can publish your puzzle on the block chain, my website [wishingwall]( can do this.
the difficult part is how the buyer pay the fee to you
@_date: 2015-09-24 04:50:26
sometimes it takes hours.I had a transaction which cost 8 hours
@_date: 2015-09-23 06:05:12
yes, people are lazy, they even do not understand what's money.

@_date: 2015-09-12 02:07:43
What does the "id;xxx" means ? why some people write this ?
@_date: 2015-09-09 23:25:21
yeah, at first I also think it's a XCP burn, but after look into the XCP protocol, it's not.
@_date: 2015-09-09 23:29:02
yes, and multi-sig is more popular, for it doesn't have length limit.
XCP and [
use multi-sig
@_date: 2015-09-23 04:20:22
me too.
