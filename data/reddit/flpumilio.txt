Dude, are you seriously making excuses when another socialist country fails? It never ceases to amaze. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:29:47
bullying is far from why socialism fails.... has to do with the lack of a pricing system and economic signals and triggers... it is simply the least efficient system devised in modern history.

You quote statistics but do not even know what they represent. you think an imaginary determination of what poverty is represents anything in real terms, but it does not. Calling someone bellow the poverty line in the United States, while not realizing that those in that category are still richer than the average middle class than say Portugal. Poverty levels are determined by the median household income of that individual country, its bellow 60% the median income puts you in the poverty level. The United States has a very high median household income, so therefore even though you are bellow the poverty line you are much better off than those in countries like Portugal in middle class(EDIT: Also our poverty line is even nearly equal to the median household income of the United Kingdom, Italy, Japan, and Spain. Not exactly what are considered countries riddled with famine...) . So throwing off useless information like that as a "Gotcha" moment simply shows your lack of understanding of statistics.

Alan Greenspan. the guy that said the economy was fine days prior. the guy that is directly responsible for the fed rate. right. and yes prosperity. I dont know what country you are in but the average american is still in the top 1% of the world. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 15:16:19
Just so you know, those statistics were adjusted for both the level of taxation and PURCHASING POWER. They are are directly from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. You are acting like I am saying america is perfect. I am against the drug war, the number one reason for the high prison population. I am against the subsidization of healthcare, and I work in healthcare, and its the reason for runaway costs. I dont think the elites have my best interest, but I think the elites use regulations and are the ones that write regulations for their benefit. I am not a flag kisser, I am an anarchist, I do not worship any sky cloth. Too many assumptions on your part. Nothing I posted is "high school economics." Schools do not teach proper economics in this country. They teach warped Keynesian demand side economics that I disagree with. My point is the freer the market the more prosperous the people. Regulations are tailored to benefit the elite. Since "the system is run by them and for them," why would giving them more regulatory power benefit me? Your words. Not mine. Although I agree.

This would be great, but I highly doubt they are a trustworthy group to produce a crypto. They will not be able to fund their insane government without inflationary practices or insane taxation. They will have to have back doors to confiscate the currency or they will have to cut back government to free market levels, which is highly unlikely. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 02:38:01
I don't think you understand the business cycle and its relation to monetary policy and its cause in the recession... It had nothing to do with deregulation or industries being self regulated.  It had more to do with regulations and inflation than anything. Regulations to lower the requirements for lending and increasing access to easy credit. The government literally encourage over consumption, and encouraged people to purchase houses they were not financially able to afford. Yet again, that is not the actual cause of the boom that led to the recession, but rather what guided it to occur in the housing market. The true cause is easy credit and monetary expansion thanks to monetary policy of the federal reserve. I don't understand how socialistic policies always somehow can called capitalist and the banes of communism is always placed at the feet of free markets. 
You call me deluded when I live in a country with complete prosperity, and tell me that the country that doesn't even have fucking toilet paper on the shelf is the example we should follow. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 21:21:12

Narcissistic people are who end up in government positions, that's why they want to be "leaders" and "rulers" they feel they should have power over the rest of society. I say no rulers. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 11:27:44
I already explained why. There is no pricing system is the largest reason why. And no I am talking socialism. Which is the state ownership of the means of production. The state does a poor job of maintaining efficiency as there is no profit motive. They have no reason to increase productivity when they acquire funds through force and not voluntary means. The farther removed from voluntary interactions between free individuals the less efficient and more distorted the outcomes are. Look at the United States, the heavily regulated and heavily subsidized markets are those that rise the fastest in price, and stagnate in efficiency. Healthcare, education, housing, all have been shooting up in costs, meanwhile the amount of administrative staff and employees that effectively don't create product go up much faster than those that provide actual services or production. It is just the same pattern that repeats itself over and over. The results are the same in actual socialism except on a wide scale infiltrating all sectors of the economy. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:34:31
Clearly you missed all the points listed before. Again roads are not built through income tax. Second, Taxation is theft. If I do not pay taxes, men will show up with guns and take it from me. That is theft. Basic education has been around without taxation. Clearly you are delusional if you think 80% tax rate on corporations would benefit the population. Im done with this conversation as I don't think you even remotely understand economics to not get what I mean by corporations don't pay taxes. I mean they pass the added cost to the consumer. You can post again, but like I said before, we have philosophical differences. Only problem is your belief is forced on my by governments guns. Finally roads are not even built by government, government is just the middle man. Society and the free market has solved way more difficult problems than how to fund the construction of roads(BTW hint the first freeways in the United States were paid for voluntarily by companies). As for your last point, companies only exist due to the fact we demand their services lmao. The only ones that can avoid doing so are usually politically connected and receive that stolen money you are so proud of.

Also, you claim tax cuts are antihumanism? Thats insane. Taxes are theft. I don't care if its rich or poor. Also if you look at the tax plan it actually removes loop holes and effectively raises taxes on the rich. the cuts or corporate taxes, which btw, corporations don't pay taxes. They either offshore or raise prices on the consumer. Get your head out of the sand. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:43:01
I disagree, even uncle Bernie wasn't against the warfare state. I was not at all wrong in my terminology. Progressives is an extremely accurate word for the camp I am referring. although the results are the same, left or right, the results will remain, increased inflation, increased warfare, decreased freedom, left or right doesn't matter. Bitcoin was developed to rid us of the federal reserve, without the fed btw progressive policies would never stand a chance to survive. BTCs purpose, is to defund government, and get us out from under the federal reserve. As for the road bullshit, I am sorry, but there are better ways to fund roads than through coercion and in a voluntary manner.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:12:22

@_date: 2017-12-08 15:54:18
Your post is has multiple statements that are incredibly false. The first thing I would like to point out is you claim I said I must select the evil of my side. I never said that. You assumed it. I said both are responsible for horseshit which I definitely did and they are definitely. So you are saying Democrats are not to blame for the state of our country? Our perpetual warfare? How about the insane amounts of spending on the welfare state leading to our inflationary currency? You don't think they have part to blame? Are you really that blinded by cognitive dissonance? You don't think that all these welfare programs and insane spending don't add to our financial woes of our country, that don't help get individuals out of poverty but rather trap them there? And you say nonsensee about anti progress but often times, these attempts at progress hinder it. You don't think the trillion dollar stimulus was a handout for crony capitalism? The trillion dollar Affordable care act? Those are handouts to big corporations at the expense of the taxpayer, you just like them because they pretend to have good intentions. They aren't banning Muslims, not that I approve of the travel bans. Obama expanded on bush's policies, the patriot act, drone strikes, the number of countries we were at war with(declared or not). Stop pretending that both sides aren't guilty. Also, you can't say "Republicans are racist" sure some probably are, but if you don't think some democrats are too you are fooling yourself. Keep making excuses all you want for the democrats, but the reality is they are no more pro freedom than the republicans. Again you are assuming and stating that I support republicans when I clearly stated they are responsible for plenty of wrong doing. We have philosophical differences on rights. I do not think the government has special rights of theft and kidnapping, but they granted it to themselves. I don't think groups have rights, only individuals. I don't believe the government has any business in healthcare, in marriage, the bedroom, gun laws, etc. You can argue all you want, but that will not change. The government gets its ability to act, through the delegation of action from the people to it. Therefore if the people do not have the right to commit theft, kidnapping or murder, neither does the government. Therefore I think taxation is immoral and wrong. I think inflation is wrong, it is why bitcoin exists, and without inflation the welfare/warfare state can't exist. Keep defending corrupt politicians because they say warm fuzzies about minorities and women, promise free shit in return for votes. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:03:09
I never implied tax evasion is the answer. I am simply stating that paying taxes is no noble cause. Its dumb to believe it is. Its theft and the government missuses their funds, they use it for cronyism, warfare, and lead to insane inefficiencies and misallocations of resources throughout the economy making everybody poorer.

@_date: 2017-08-17 15:40:15
true. government is worse because its mandatory, visa is not. thats why the post said alternatives that a decentralized. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 15:23:47
True but I think they are refering to the strategy of, buy what you can on a weekly basis, set aside say 50 bucks a check to exchange into bitcoin. IF you do that, in the long run, you will be in the green. Its good advice, particularly for newbies that look at it as day trading and lose money. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 15:38:59
it didnt say it couldn't, saod we need an alternative that is decentralized. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 15:24:46
Again, I think this is simply a statement that in the long run, don't stress yourself out. A lot of us believe just set aside x amount a check to purchase btc with, even if the price is high when you buy, eventually itll be in the green. Its just a lower stress way with less FUD. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 10:43:39
I highly doubt making modest predictions is why bitcoin isnt taken seriously. There are plenty of other reasons though. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:44:14
except the stock market has an influx of easy credit through monetary expansion directed at it. the stock market, healthcare, housing, and education are true business cycle bubbles. what people forget is unlike the housing bubble, dot com bubble, sacings bubble, etc bitcoin isnt being inflated by the fed and easy credit. that is where you get true bubbles.

@_date: 2017-09-20 11:29:25
lmao, central banks destroy currencies not stabilize them. In doing so they cause economic bubbles and misallocation of resources. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 11:46:52
Inflating the currency only delays the trouble of overspending it doesnt eliminate the consequences. Greece is in trouble because of ita own gluteny. Having a crypto would not help them but rather lead to a head much quicker the consequences of a wellfare state. The only way it would benefit thw greek government is if they could control the inflation. notice i said greek government...not greeks. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 11:31:59
Yes because we havent learned that explosive growth triggered by easy credit from central banks dont lead to volotility. You shouldnt be into bitcoin if you believe that nonsense. Monetary expansion creates inflation and encourages rapid growth in sectors of the economy favored by government, it is unsustainable and always leads to nationwide crashes, and destruction of real wealth. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 13:25:59
Australia has one of the better economies in the world without a doubt, but the effects of inflation still lowers real wages and favors those that are well connected in the banking industry as they get the inflation prior to the devaluation that occurs, and those connected to industries that get easy credit will also be benefited disproportionately, all the while robbing the real purchasing power of the people. I am okay with a central bank, as long as I am allowed to use a different currency, but almost every country outlaws that action and will take action on those that would rather use an alternative.  
@_date: 2017-09-20 16:32:15
I am a much larger believer in the writings of Mises than Keynes. Ill stick to my position that central banks cause more issues than they fix, mostly due to inflationary practices.
@_date: 2017-09-20 16:31:17
I totally understand inflation and its correlation of value with gdp, but the problem is its used as a crutch to increase deficit spending and granting special interests benefits. look at the welfare and warfare state of the united states, it would be impossible without inflation. and yes there are occurences where competing currencies lead to arrests as "counterfitting" I also disagree that savings is a bad thing. we have a major over consumption issue and many live outside of their means. if we had deflationary currencies it encourages people to be smarter with their money. durable long lasting goods are nore appealing, as is spending within your means rather than living off debt. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 11:47:58
Shocking how many people defend government monetary policy on this sub when it is the reason Bitcoin exists. to combat inflationary practices that destroy the wealth of the people in favor of warfare and welfare states.

@_date: 2017-05-26 15:05:00
The assets you need in proportion to what the reserve requirements is basically causeing it to be free. i am not speaking literally and that is quite obvious. The fed interest rates being artificially low is the equivalent of free mokney as those receiving the newly creates money prior to the devaluation occurs. i am done with this conversation as you are not saying anything i havent read or heard in the past. we disagree on the benefits of fractional reserve systems, i feel they are immoral as they are required to ve used. it lowers the quality of money people have in savings BENEFITING those gettinf the inflatjonary cyrrency first. so i still feel it is theft. i dont think anyone should be forced to participate in a currency that is constantly being manipulated. it is the direct cause for every large scale bubble and subsequent burst as the money being inflated into those markets have historically been thanks to low interest rates. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:51:20
Actually the Roman Empire was debasing its currency much like the fed is today. The romans were diluting gold coin to stretch it farther, fighting wars on multiple fronts, buying the peoples allegiance with that currency and entertainment. weird. sounds familiar.  
@_date: 2017-05-29 13:59:14
I'd disagree. With governments out of control spending and the feds inflationary practices, we need it more than people realize, but the reserve status of world currencies has made it hide its inflation way better than otherwise would have occurred.

@_date: 2017-05-25 17:33:22
i was emphasizing the fact they were debasing their currency in the same way the fed is now. and yes i am demonizing them for maintaining inflation which is higher than their goals. inflation in terms of dollars not devaluing the currency that is a side effect of inflation. the destruction of the purchasing of peoples savings is immoral and no the fed has not been properly audited at all. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:45:32

@_date: 2017-05-25 16:44:07
there are plenty of good books about it outside the realm of keynsian economists. the banks that failed should've(thanksbot) been liquidated. it would have been a sharo pain but it would of recovered much quicker. good examples are the great depression verses 1920. You are on the wrong forum if you think the fed is righteous or even beneficial... inflationary properties of the fed are the direct cause of the housing boom, not the so called predatory lending nonsense, which was encouraged by government regulation btw. the banks were getting easy money from fhs fed to lend out. read Meltdown for a great overview of the subject.  
also, why is it days before the crash only Austrian economists could see trouble while Paulson and the like said a widespread bust was impossible?

I don't get your point? The great depression had plenty of inflationary spending and programs on the governments part, wage caps, spending programs, artificially trying to keep costs up and stimulate the economy, much like the 08 recession. Government actions lead to prolonged adjustments and inhibits the market from correcting the malinvestments that lead to the problem to begin with. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 20:03:18
I am done with your conversation, you belittle with the way you define simple economic terms as if I am unaware of them and its obnoxious. I am very well aware of what hyperinflation is along with inflation theft, etc. I have read multiple books on the subject and I can cite as many sources as you demand, yet it will not go anywhere. We have both heard the opposing views. I have made an informed decision that the Austrain view of the business cycle is more sound than the Keynesian views of interest rate manipulation and quantitative easing. The evidence stacked side by side the Austrians explanation of the occurrences hold more merit in my eyes, as the Keynesian's do yours. The Austrians are extremely consistent in their facts, theories and their proposals, they are the most consistent of any school of thought. 
Also, in 2008 those speculators had easy access to easy money, thanks to fed interest rates low, government did encourage lax requirements for approvals etc. 
This was not an interesting conversation for me, sorry I am done. It's been years since I read into the business cycle and am rusty, also come to the conclusion drawn out debates on the internet are pointless. You clearly are informed on your viewpoints but so am I.

btw people dont need to own assets or wealth to lend out. thats the whole problem with the inflationary practices of the fed. there is almost no risk when the large banks and corporarions get what amounts to be free money. it takes away the risk assessment as well as the cues based on savings when to invest in capital goods versus production. if you think this is ny first conversation or first time on the topic of the federal reserve you are mistaken.

Where did I say anything incorrect? And no you can't use gold or whatever you wish, that has been made clear. People have been arrested for trying to pay employees in silver. Only Arizona a few others allow gold as legal tender. 
If gold and silver are already allowed why are states having to pass legislation to avoid their citizens being taxed for capital gains. IT is also possible to be arrested for paying for items in gold, as happened to a man in North Carolina. 
You keep saying they are doing a good job and that banks do not benefit from receiving the inflation first, are you insane? How is receiving money at the lowest interest rate on the market and being able to charge others for that money that was just created out of thin air, for you not a financial benefit?
Also i don't know of a single case of hyperinflation without government banks being involved. And no bubbles were not worse before the fed, more frequent and smaller yes. And don't forget the current fed was not the first central bank of the United States.

I wouldnt care about the fed if it were legal to use competing currencies. last argument i had some dude was saying i can use gold and silver...even though the liberty dollar guy did that and got arrested for counterfitting and tax evasion, they tax it out of practicality. with a target inflationary rate of 3-4% and, usually achieving much higher than that seeing as cpi ignores costs of food, gas, housing, and clothing, thats the equivalent of losing $40 every year on $1000 in the bank. that is stealth taxation.
