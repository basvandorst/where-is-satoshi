Kinda true but not quite, here is a translation for a similar article from dnevnik, another popular bulgarian newspaper.
*The income, that an individul/ person earned by trading or selling the virtual currency bitcoin, would be taxed at 10%, announced the Bulgarian Revenue Agency. 
The deadline to declare the income earned during 2013 is April 30, 2014.
The income would be the net profit / loss from all bitcoin transactions, and need to be declared in Table 5 -  
The Bulgarian Revenue Agency doesn't require that any receipts from the bitcoin transactions are to be provided with the tax calculations.*
Bulgaria has a pretty low tax rate,  its ~10-15%. So you'll be charged at 10% on capital gains on realized gains. Taxes are different in Bulgaria. Also they don't really care for receipts, and probably no individual will pay their taxes on this unless they're moving quite large amounts through banks. Maybe only small btc companies will actually pay taxes.

Heres a translation of the most important parts. I speak Bulgarian.
