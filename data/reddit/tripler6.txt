I think it's possible you might see unheard of prices in the next week. I'd wait. But I've been wrong before, and the truth is no one has any idea.

Technology is neat.

Let me just say - wow, these guys go all out for picture day. Tuxedos?

Oh cool, thanks for explaining it to me. 
With that much money, it seems easier to just buy massive amounts of coin at low prices to crash the economy.

What you're saying is a third-party should be responsible for your security online. While that sounds nice, it isn't how the world works as we've seen today. People need to become personally responsible for their own security - if not on every little forum and website, at LEAST for financial concerns like bitcoin and credit cards.

Wow you think btc is finished?
@_date: 2011-05-23 10:27:03
I think I just swallowed my tongue.

Password leaks are happening all the time - anyone smart enough to do so should not only prepare for such a possibility, they should expect it to happen.
Off the top of my head, I've been leaked by ps3, citi, gawker, mtgox, codemasters, best buy.. and that's in the last what, two months? Simply being smart about opening email attachments isn't cutting it anymore.

People who take risks, occasionally get screwed. I don't think that's an inaccurate statement.
Using a bad password, or the same password everywhere, will get you screwed. But the difference is last year, you were probably okay. This year - you aren't. Databases are getting leaked every day now, it becomes less of a risk and more of a certainty. 
If we're doing analogies, if I was certain I'd crash my car into a tree within the next week or two, you're damn right I'd wear a seatbelt, and I'd have no one to blame but myself if I died as a result of not preparing for that.

I agree, my other theory is gox had a huge master account that held everything before site BTC withdrawls - but that's pure speculation.
 &lt;-lawl.

A million isn't cool. You know what's cool?
@_date: 2011-06-19 20:57:52
I have a question.
Mt.Gox trades internally and then doles out BTC or USD, right? Well to send out BTC it probably has an account where all the current BTC on mt.gox is held, correct? Like a bank vault. Could that have been hacked?
(note: im probably wrong, but i'd like to know the process regardless.)
@_date: 2011-08-05 05:55:20
Well crap. I had like .5 btc on there.
@_date: 2011-06-27 09:40:29
Zero refs so far. (PS I think my number is really cool.)
@_date: 2011-05-24 07:20:19
Anyone with serious amounts of BTC isn't storing their wallet on a PC anyways. It's on an encrypted thumb drive, in a box somewhere.

This guy is a real piece of work. 
Move one fucking coin. Move one coin and this all ends today. That's not hard to do.

Because cocaine is a helluva drug, that's why.
@_date: 2013-04-08 00:23:41
congrats. Makes me wish I had the foresight to get onto this back when slashdot first told me about it.

One trillion by may.

I too, have a reddit account.

People lie? For fun? On the *internet?*
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:36:02
I, for one, am patiently waiting for the day bitcoins hit a buck or two (so I can buy every last one of them.)
@_date: 2013-04-08 00:22:08
The blockchain will be sustained by miners just like always. It will just come from transaction fees instead of bitcoin rewards, that's all.
Also, this won't happen until 2140. Don't worry about it, you'll be dead.
