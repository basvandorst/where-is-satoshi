It’s like WhatsApp but uses blockchain technology to send and receive messages. Also you can send and recording Bitcoin from one another. Kinda like WeChat can be used to send payments in the same way with RMB but bitcoin instead.

Costs more in monthly payments if you can afford 0.27BTC in one go then you can buy an iPhone upfront just use a sim only contract.

Blockchain.info for EUR USD &amp; GBP for over £100 there’s a recommended option using the bank which is 9.50£ standard I believe you can spend £800 and only pay 9.50 in bank fees. GDAX is another option owned by Coinbase who have high fees but GDAX is a way around it no fees. Personally i find blockchain easier.
