I mean I'd be all for it, but I don't see that happening any time soon. Their video advertising profit is probably gonna just 5x to 10x over the next five years, when others are willing to spend as much as they do on a TV commercial

You are correct. 10 minutes. I was thinking of the 6 confirmations that many places are using.
@_date: 2014-01-25 10:22:43
this is a fun community 
@_date: 2014-03-01 01:13:04
Yeah, this question is directed toward those small $4-40 purchases that are already happening instantaneously.
I still feel there's something more that should be implemented than just some "zero confirmation" to reduce risk.
A very simple solution is like what I mentioned:
An app with an online wallet (user usually has $100 or less in it) that sends the transaction to the merchants PoS. The PoS software receives a "text message" verification within seconds that the transaction has indeed been sent. The PoS accepts this, prints out a receipt and the customer is on his/her way.
@_date: 2014-03-01 00:55:28
Yes I am aware. But technically, if both users can securely verify that the transaction has started, this would be solved, no?
@_date: 2014-03-01 01:03:12
Most merchants want security and zero liability when it comes to accepting a new technology.
I don't think zero-confirmations is a good enough answer.
I think Bitcoin has the potential to be even safer and more reliable than cash or credit.
I feel like we should use that to our advantage and make it a no-brainer implementation for companies.
@_date: 2014-02-04 01:45:08
I question that sometimes as well :)
So is the spirit/community of Bitcoin strong enough to spend their Bitcoin even if they suspect the value to rise in the future?
@_date: 2014-03-23 14:27:45
If you buy something with Bitcoin, be sure to rebuy in the same about of Bitcoinyou just spent.
Problem solved :)
@_date: 2014-02-04 01:48:01
If it stays as a commodity, it continues to ride on it's perceived value.
Cryptocurrency is the future. 
If Bitcoin ends up staying a commodity and storage of value, then some other Crypto that is more transactional will fill in the market demand. If that happens, does Bitcoin sustain it's value/usefulness?
@_date: 2014-02-06 02:10:45
I can see Apple coming out with their own crypto alternative in the near future
@_date: 2014-02-04 11:05:12
True. I suppose there are some questions that can't be answered concretely.
It is interesting how the currency did grow over time, probably because of the novelty factor and confidence like you mentioned. Perhaps even some idealism.
But yeah, good discussion, helped me come away with a better understanding :)
@_date: 2014-02-07 05:14:11

It is essentially a Keynesian vs. Austrian argument. 
The thing is, central banks do a lot more than create this inflation. Also, these DogeCoins being added aren't "Free." There will still have to be significant mining in order to get these 5 billion coins/year.

And yeah, I invested in both, but I really want to get around to setting up a mining rig. 
I have always had a decent idea of how to set it all up, but actually doing it would be a fun learning experience IMO.

@_date: 2014-02-04 10:11:33
Ok, I see your point.
But I feel it is a sliding scale. People will spend *slightly* less if they feel their currency will increase in value. This slows down the growth of the economy.
@_date: 2014-03-01 01:57:55
10 minutes is an issue for consumers though. That is what this post was about.
Those are very solid points to convince merchants to switch though.
@_date: 2014-02-04 01:51:52
I'm all for a good discussion :)
If I had to give one precise point, I would argue that there has been no viable alternative to Bitcoin yet. 
Newer, faster, greener technology is being built, but isn't quite there. 
Also, I would argue the markets/prices are driven just as much by hype, speculation, and a bit of greed as they are by strong technical analysis
@_date: 2014-03-01 00:59:02
Thanks for sticking around. I knew this would get instant downvotes. :P
@_date: 2014-03-22 21:58:45
"Crypto" and "Currency" are both unappealing terms, like he mentions.
I like what he said about "Bankless Money."
The term "Digital Cash" works pretty well too.
@_date: 2014-01-21 11:13:55
that channel is just trying to justify everything. they are trying to turn it all into a logical conclusion, but i wouldn't say they're outsmarting everyone or anything. that just is a few speculators not interested in the long term growth of the coin. speculators can be found anywhere
@_date: 2014-02-03 12:50:27
Okay, if you are expecting Bitcoin to increase in value no matter what, that makes sense. 
I'm saying Bitcoin likely will increase in value long-term, but there is a possibility of volatility still in the market when Bitcoin can drop in price.
Nothing is 100% guaranteed to go up.
@_date: 2014-01-21 05:22:30

@_date: 2014-03-01 00:53:47
Its a legitimate question people have.
I think there are technologies that can be built to solve this.
@_date: 2014-03-01 03:31:13
Ahh, I might have misread your first post.
When I say merchant, I mean store owners. 
The technology for immediate transactions is almost there, but not as seamless and easy for store owners and customers as it should be.

the same. maybe a little hungrier.
@_date: 2014-02-04 01:55:39
Are you suggesting that consumerism needs to end?
I mean I get where you are coming from, but the end of consumerism is a very very gradual process. People have grown up their whole lives conditioned by it. I would argue people on this Bitcoin forum are excluded from that ~70% that want to maintain the status quo.

@_date: 2014-02-04 09:21:33


Okay, so what you are saying holds some merit, but it makes some assumptions.
Based on where we are at right now, Bitcoin is only accepted at a handful of stores. 
If people want to get out of Bitcoin because they fear it will drop in price, this doesn't mean that they are necessarily gonna spend it at Overstock.com or another merchant.
What is more likely to happen at this point, is that they would "cash out" at an exchange. Bitcoin is directly tied to USD value at this point. 
If the entire market fears that Bitcoin will drop in price, the demand to buy Bitcoin will drop. This means a greater amount of sellers than buyers, thus decreasing the price even more.
And if someone does decide to buy at a certain price because they feel it is a "good deal," then they will be hoarding the coin in expectation of a price increase.
Both scenarios lead to hoarding or selling, at least until the market is ubiquitous with places to spend BTC.

Take a look right now. r/dogecoin is back to more active users again than r/bitcoin.

I'm not sure how that relates. Those computers become cheaper because they become outdated.
It's like saying a fruit will eventually grow mold and it becomes cheaper.
@_date: 2014-02-03 06:15:56
Why does an exchange always need ties to a physical world? It's 2014. Bitcoin is more versatile for online purchases anyway...
The technology is coming, most countries will have to embrace it. If not, there's definitely means to get ahold of a few Bitcoins if you search around enough.
@_date: 2014-02-09 19:25:45
This makes way more sense. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 17:44:41
1. "Benefit" is how often the currency is used. Bitcoin has an advantage in entrepreneurship known as "first movers advantage." Though if it is not taking advantage of this because of hoarding, it basically negates its biggest strength.
2. The "collective" is the holders of Bitcoin. Rational for them would be to keep circulating their currency in order to get more and more adopters. 
My point is that bitcoin made some decent waves. 
However, the problem is, most people holding expect their money to increase, or else they wouldn't be holding. Holding hurts mass adoption though.
The reason Bitcoin has been sustained so far is because people believe in the idea collectively.
However, what is stopping a strong alternative cryptocurrency, one that facilitates more transactions, to enter the marketplace?
Once the merchant technology like Coinbase becomes more widespread, it can move onto accepting new cryptocurrencies, which is new ground that has never been broken before.
If/when a new, better coin comes out, Bitcoin would become a "substitute good" that could easily be replaced by a coin that has a less economic incentive toward hoarding.
The "proof of concept" of Bitcoin has finally been reached, and now MAJOR MAJOR players in the startup and financial world are competing for cryptocurrency dominance. 
Most Bitcoin owners have faith their coins are gonna reach $10-100k+. And its a risk they are willing to take.
If a new cryptocurrency overtakes them, it will come like a storm overnight, and Bitcoins value will drop like a rock. It won't be a gradual decrease.
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:41:31
It's kinda funny that Bitcoin currently has more active users on their subreddit than Dogecoin (when that hasn't been the case for the last 2+ weeks).
Then it dawned on me... The Shibes are all here right now :P

Thanks for the reply. I'm still working on learning more and more.
Who actually has the authority/power to Hard Fork? I mean, is it in the hand of just one person? Multiple people? It seems like it requires a crucial amount of trust/faith in that person. Which can be a good/bad thing.

$500,000 isn't bad, but it certainly isn't overwhelming. 
Numbers have continually dropped each day for both companies, so it hasn't exactly been sustained sales.
It was arguably a PR/Marketing move by both companies. 
I'm curious to see if this spending continues, especially if Bitcoin starts to show relatively high volatility again.
@_date: 2014-02-04 02:57:02
True. I agree with that. I feel we're in the minority right now though.
Also, I'd debate that the people conditioned to spend money are gonna be the last ones to adopt Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 01:57:51
True. Maybe that is a better reference than Tragedy of the Commons.
Not sure, they both seem pretty similar, no? :)
@_date: 2014-01-25 01:35:49
having a bad day? ...wanna talk about it?
@_date: 2014-02-04 16:34:14
I would say the tragedy of the commons applies if people hoard, rather then spend money that'll grow the economy.
Bitcoin is a resource/commodity that benefits as a whole when being used. 
However, most owners are holding in hopes that price will go up. This use is irrational for the collective.
@_date: 2014-01-27 16:48:41
exactly this! it's very shortsighted to say that a merchant taking Bitcoin and then dumping it off for cash hurts Bitcoins value.
It's true, it probably will hurt price for the short-term, but this is exactly what we need for future growth. Once B2B transactions start taking place in Bitcoin, LOOK OUT.
@_date: 2014-02-08 00:34:03
this makes the most sense to me

@_date: 2014-02-04 04:34:02
My point is I don't think people are considering the effects a lack of adoption would have on the value of Bitcoin. (I'm just one person, I don't speak for the other investors/speculators)
Is that what you are asking?

True. And this makes it great as a storage of wealth, but what about people actually spending the money? Why would someone buy with BTC if the value of Bitcoin can go up 10x? 
For universal adoption, Bitcoin will have to go up about 50x-500x when all is said and done. I can't see any incentive to spend Bitcoin in the near future if mass adoption is the goal.

I agree, but doesn't this essentially toss out the perceived advantage of Bitcoin being a "cheaper" alternative with less fees?
When it comes down to it, Bitcoin is gonna have fees for services just like any other currency would.
