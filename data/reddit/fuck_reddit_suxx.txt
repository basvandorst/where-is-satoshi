I've been saying this for years. Satoshi ***has*** to be NSA or Deeper State. It's cyber-economic-warfare. It undermines all foreign banking, payment systems, derivatives, and markets. 
And somewhere, a single entity owns a million of them, untouched. But guaranteed they hit 100k to 1M as forecast (as destined) at this point by 202X, then watch them get cashed in for quadrillions by someone. 
If this was actually all one guy, then that implies that one man can change history from his basement. Unprecedented.

also because none of the bitcoin holders have any faith left in the coin, and are only here to get rich, which means performance or sell. 
how's that LN rollout coming along?  that mempool any lower yet? Fees lower than a gs tank fill up anytime soon? Still gonna be decentralized when you central LN layer two nodes are batching the bitcoin network and disincentivizing miners by reducing fees paid?
Or are you gonna fork again, leaving fragments of bagholders in your dust?

I mean, if you are using copy paste to replace typing the address, to make it accurate, to reduce risk, to make it easier.... then how would copy paste, the simplification reduction itself, become a 50/50% improbale-to-succeed task?

The real question, NEO, is would you have had to bought a dongle using any other repackage of off the shelf parts from any other manufacturer? 
You were a tool for a table of shareholders to become billionaires. And it was all just to turn humans..... into reddit comments from the shitter driving page loads for ad revenue. 
The information age was a sham, Neo, Web 2.0 wasn't even the first strike. Eventually the skies blackened from social-media-banter-instigated-nuclear-war, and then our own hubris was turned against us. Before the wall could be built, we'd already lost wall street to crypto currency and silicon Valley to India.

I think we should take all cars away. They can turn any direction, even outside the lines. I'm not saying it's likely, but people definitely can fuck it up. Sure, you can just look at what youre doing and pay attention, but who does that when moving their investemnts or life savings around?
I know I just casually do important stuff, without even looking at it or knowing what I"m doing in the first place. 
I wonder how these people that can't make a transfer are supposed to adopt this fucking shit? Make a case for that, that people will use something so complicated that copy paste can't even fix because what if you aren't looking at the screen when you do it?
What kind of argument are you trying to make? For or against bitcoin, here? I can't even tell anymore. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 01:45:15
So you're saying the adoption rate of bitcoin is influencing information seekers to arrive at reddit and make accounts to interactively seek knowledge? 
But this is one of the largest global communities with the highest concentration of other users. Why would people go there for information?
This is how you sound. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:23:44
Yeah, let me rephrase the reasons bitcoin will fail:
-complexity for users
-no use cases
-slower than western union
-surrounded by 1400 companies with improved versions of the same tech and an identified market to use it in
-doesn't rely exclusively on projections and promises to create value
-dropped as a currency by multiple major global retailers
-was only adopted for a few months or so anyway. 
Failed experiment. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 00:34:17
so bitfinex legit created 2+ billion dollars worth of USDT and said it's backed by USD in 1:1 ratios, then immediately disabled redemption of tether for USD at all?
The only people who get value out of tether are people who exchange it for anything else, since it can't actually be exchanged for a USD. Wow. 
I mean, this is basic scam 101. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 06:26:58

for sure. it's weird because they advertise that they are [quantum secure]( right on the home page. I wonder what really happened, you know?
@_date: 2018-01-23 00:04:53
I mean, unless this dude is al qaeda or one of the secret service guys that dipped into Ross Ulbrichts stash, or a prolific phisher/scammer, this shouldn't happen right? A money laundering investigation would be behind the scenes, and not necessarily instigated only  upon withdrawal. 
So my theory is they followed the coins but it wasn't until he moved them to an address tied to KYC that he was able to be detected as a specific person. 
Alternatively, they could have given a routine standard response and the delay is some background insolvency or other black swan type situation. 
Has this been  occuring at a frequent rate in the community? I've only heard of perhaps a few including this one.

no it's going down because people are tired of waiting for bitcoin to deliver lightning network so that fees will dorp below a new game's price, and then they realized that LN just removes all the decentralization and rdefeats the purpose, so ideologically, semantically, and philosophically, there was no reason to hold the coin. ANd with the price falling, too, then what is the purpose of leaving misplaced faith in empty promises we've heard for ten years?

If this is the case, then why bother to stop these people withdrawing dirty coins? 
And more importantly, what was the mechanism of tagging a coin as dirty? 
How much defeat of decentralization does this present if any authority can implement iron KYC and ALM laws at every exit and just tag then wait? 
All of crypto just lost it's ability to defeat oversight.

because not every single one of them is coming from secure channels. There was a redditor on here not long ago who received a ledger nano S and the seed word card inside was fake. The device was actually preowned, and had been configured to steal any funds put into it. 
and of course the attack worked, and they are definitely not alone. chances are that EVERY used ledger and EVERY other ledger being sold anywhere but from the official site is compromised. 
it's only a matter of time before they withdraw.

Lol, no, crypto are just different forms of DRM, a way to make digital goods scarce, whiche before was not possible and led to leaks in profits due to duplication and copying and piracy.
Thanksfully, bitcoin prevents all of that, as tying a satoshi to a game key or mp3 requires the limit of only 1 instance of that key, and thanks to blockchain, no one can duplicate or add new keys because the rest of the network would have to agree. 
If you don't see the value in bringing scarcity to digital goods, then you've never been a content creator whose had their work stolen and also lack imagination.
Banks and regulation have nothing to do with it. THough, they will try to centralize account ledgers to prevent money laundering and terrorism funding flows, and all of that. So there will always be an exit or entrance where an ID will be required. Which means centralization.

I appreciate your explanation, but I want to go a little deeper. 
Isn't tether supposed to be tethered to the US dollar? Ought it not be able to be another price than 1 dollar? Shouldn't the alt it is pairing with be the one to have growth or slippage? 
It's not so simple, as far as I can tell.

This pullback is different, in=t came during a time when the market had 1400 competitors in a better position, and also for the first time saw it's market cap fall over 50%.

I think disputing a charge is for insecure credit cards and the companies who provide these insecure cards need an ability to reverse a transaction because of the frequency and ease of fraud using them.
Further, as an online merchant, I know to expect some percentage of charge backs from legitimate customers because their credit card allows them to commit the fraud. 
Further, what is the purpose of reversing a transaction? The implication here is that a mistake was made. Why not mitigate the mistakes?

if only users were taught better security at any time in their life. 
every day I see threads telling people what to do to stay secure, but everyone makes the assumption that it will not be them next, that it's only these other people. 
but that's not true. real hacks are quiet and run in the background and get everything and are not technological in nature, but psychological attacks on your security. 
we are the weakest links in our security. 
So since telling people hasn't worked so far, then I decided to try and show people. 
Maybe the ledger is great. I don't know. I use paper in three places and a diversity of exchanges. It seems like just another security vector and cost. It's not necessary. 
Isn't it just a USB stick? 
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:32:02
Oh fuck, you did the wrong thing and it went badly. If only you had paid attention to what you were doing, like when you play League of Legends or drive a car or do your salaried job and take care of your family, all harder things to do that the average person does than make a transfer. 
On the one hand, you people say it's simple, fast and easy, and secure!  Then on the other you say it's too complicated, slow, and the fees are too high, It's too easy to lose your money if you don't know what you are doing, like sending litecoins to a bitcoin address. 
Who would even do that, a person who has done due diligence on their investment? I mean, come on. It's ridiculous on both sides of the coin.

I actually did read it, I just didni't have an immediate response at this time. He has valid arguments and I will see how persuasive they are as I research the claims and the implications. 
And I'm not convinced, as after analysing his point and prose I determined the only information in their words are that bitcoin has an upper limit on it's ability to sidestep regional economic distress because it's fees are too large and inflationary, to the point where ultimately no one even *can* use it.
That's basically my own original point in a thesis instead of a paragraph. And full of weasel words and implications. No statements fully articulated which could be persuasive by their merits or validity. It's just a stream of conciousness from a 20 something with 100k$ bitcoin dreams in his eyes. 
And just a dream. What global team of economists markets would even let it get to such a stage? It's preposterous from the surface down. Wasted my time.

Well, I understand that blockchain derived assets like bitcoin and the 1400 other alts provide something extremely innovative: a way to make digital assets scarcity.
Digital scarcity will do wonders for DRM in games and movies and music, and will be fantastic and making banks more money by reducing their internal frictions and costs, and it will be great for investors who had capital in the beginning. So, yeah, from an economics standpoint as well as a technological frame of reference, I understand blockchains thoroughly. 
My question is why you would continue to think that of all 1400 implementations of blockchain, why bitcoin, with the most fundamental problems, longest transaction times, and highest fees, would somehow emerge as a mainstay after it markets cap slipped 50% and Microsoft and Valve/Steam stopped accepting it?
Sure, you still need bitcoin to buy alts, and that is helping slow bitcoins collapse somewhat, even though it's still slipping, but I can also incresingly buy alts in ETH USD NEO pairs, and others. 
I agree that holding certain crypto ledger tech tokens or coins will net me a profit in the long run, but nothing anyone says or links seems to bolster the opinion that bitcoin isn't dying or is more than speculation.

@_date: 2018-01-08 16:39:16
Those are applications or events in the cryptosphere, like when bitcoin finally began adoption over a handful of people, but it's scaling issues and fees ground everything to a halt and caused the rise of altcoins and began slipping it's market cap. 
They fit into the timeline but not the successfull blockchain trajectory. Successful application of a crypto wouldn't look like a 5k retreat in price and the loss of half your market cap while your fees  approached a day's minimum wage pay while surrounded by more attractive competitors with finished products. 
What were you trying to imply with your line of questions? That bitcoins time passed about 3 weeks ago and the market hasn't caught on yet because 2 year old LN promises could like, totally be any day now? Who's side are you on?

In my opinion the very best thing you can do is go learn the words. 
Find the wiki on the blockchain. Starting asking questions to help you understand from the keywords you learn there.
Go to any random coin and look at it's website, whitepaper, and dev team, and roadmap. Download and try the stuff out.
If you find cool stuff or inspiring stuff or real value, thats your sign. 
But if you can't find it, or you have to stretch to make it palatable, then let it go.

Yes it will but do you believe that that will sustain when ETH is launching 820+ decentralized apps, ARDOR goes live, lightning networks come online, and XRP is adopted in financial industry inter-bank transactions, and IOTA is inserting itself between the different devices in the wider Internet of Things for it's own inter-service micro-transactions and integration into xbox live and eventual replacement of microsoft points, providing a unified cross-gaming currency that will revolution RMT, grinding, and eSports. 
Meanwhile, bitcoin is still going to be in development. Until later in the year when they come online with their scaliong solutions and first industry applications and solutions, there will massive flooding of money from the stale or falling bitcoin in spring and summer into the XRP/IOTA/ETH/XMR blockchains. Even litecoin and dash are going to have a hard time competing and may suffer the same culling of wider market education combined witht he fear of missing out as everyone holding 99% of coins watches red candles long as they are tall appear across teh board except in the actual products which actually exist. I mean, it's been like 10 years of development. 
Now is the time. Now or never. The herd dis coming and the analysts are coming and the sharks are coming and so is the light.
Good luck!

If I may restate my position:
The topic is cashing out into assets rather than fiat then assets. 
If a person bypasses withdrawing into fiat, and spends the coins directly, they pay the smallest possible fee of a single transaction. They will not have to convert to fiat +fee and withdraw +fee and claim as income and get taxed.
They will just pay the transaction fee. That's my whole on-topic point. It is mathematically better. The OP is correct in their assertion.

@_date: 2017-12-28 22:36:36
While I 1000% agree that bad actors use bitcoin for illegal activity, I 1,000,000% disagree that bitcoin enabled or encouraged any growth in those black markets whatsoever. 
Restated: The supply and demand of drugs and other black market items was there before bitcoin, supplying all of the demand and using a particular popular currency named the dollar. In 2003-2005 it was found that RMT in MMO games was essentially a money laundering and payment scheme used largely by the international drug and weapon trade. They would use a game currency bought with cash and traded in-game to a character from a shop to another character as a fund transfer through another in-game trade of their own. They would then sell the game money for real money back to the exchange on the other end. Money laundered. 
And everyone knows there is always money in the banana stand and the small-town car-wash..... 
Restated again: Criminals have always diversified their capabilities and adapted new technology. I don't see you making the same argument regarding the telephone, as it is by and large the largest tool in these operations. Or how about the internet? Lots of criminals buy in bulk on the internet. Therefore, the internet must be completely villified as a whole, as well as the telephone, and both be done away with!
Using bitcoin isn't creating a black market, it is diversifying payment possibilities in an already existing black market at worst.

@_date: 2017-11-26 00:47:34
Do not spend. Only hold. Hold out a little longer. You should understand the fundamental situation we are in right now as holders of any of the cryptocurrencies:


The growth you've seen was that number coming from .00000001% (nearly a billionth) of first-worlders to the present .1%. Remember, 10,000 bitcoins would have hardly bought you a pizza when the adoption rate was so low.  
The reason is simple: supply and demand. There are a limited supply of the cryptocurrencies, and therefore with an increasing adoption rate, there must be skyrocketing prices until it reaches it's true value, somewhere around $1M USD estimated to be about 2023-2025 by the current growth charts extrapolations by trends. This assumes 25% of westerners use the coin, with average holdings of $1000. This is a several trillion dollar market cap increase projection from current $250 billion market cap in a short time. It's a literal digital gold rush, and right now, you are in the first .11% of people to get on board. 
Tomorrow, it will be a .12% saturation. That's already another 8-10% growth in your portfolio, just from holding, as your coin gets rarer. Imagine another year of adoption rate. Go to your favorite exchange and look at what a million people with a thousand dollars ( a billion dollars) would do to the price.
Then times it by ten. 
Bitcoin isn't going to 9k. Bitcoin is going to 90k now through spring. It will probably break the $400k barrier by August or September 2018 as the adoption rate reaches the .2%-.4% saturation. The market cap should surge from $250 billion to $2.2-2.5 trillion by then. This is about a 1/4th of the global gold market cap. Which performs at a few percent a year, eaten mostly by fees and brokers. Bitcoin's growth is very attractive, and the Fear of Missing Out may be powerful enough to accelerate these projections, but there is no doubt they are steps along the way to something like PayPal's adoption rate, which is around what, 35% saturation? Could you imagine if bitcoin reached an adoption rate of 35%, over the .1% current? That's 350 times growth, 350000%. Probably a 3-5 year plan for a bitcoin holder. 
That's what's happening: the adoption rate is growing everyday, as well as the market cap, versus a limited number of coins. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:03:20
It today were 5-7 years ago, I would agree with you. Back when 10k coins hardly bought a pizza and less than a thousand people used the cryptocurrency market at all, that was a safe bet. 
After being established and undergoing record adoption rate growth, it's hard to claim it is not already successful. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:45:08
all of the other indicators simply modulate my prediction. overall, barring a massive exodus, the price will only go up.

pedantic semantics, the most reddit thing I'll do all day
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:00:06
This isn't about the moon, this is about the rational realization that all of the growth is being driven by the adoption rate as a primary force. Things like good news, forks, holiday pumps, whatever, are all minor corrections to the overall growth chart. 
I feel like no one but me has ever seen Ray Kurzweil point to his graphs. You don't understand exponential growth. You don't have a feel for it, you think gossip at thanksgiving drives 10billion dollars to the market cap in 48 hours. It's not that. It's the simple adoption rate. 
TV and radio took like 50 years to reach 50% market saturation. 
Paypal took 5 years.
Bitcoin has taken 7 years so far to reach a .11% adoption rate. You just felt it grow from .09% to .10% when you saw the price rise from 6k to 8k. Then when it hit .11% adoption rate this week, you saw the price hit 9700. Next week the adoption rate will be .15%, and the price will be 10-14k. Next month the adoption rate will be .3%, and the price will be closer to 14-20k. By the end of the year, the adoption rate will exponentially grow to 1-2%, and the price will be 90-400k.
No amount of gossip is making this happen. The future is just arriving and you are going through future shock. This is the second step toward a type 1 kardashev civilization we are taking here. It has nothing to do with bubbles or markets or memes. its all about basic finance, fees, overhead, and adoption rates.

420,000 potential lurkers. 
Maybe 5-10 million people total using bitcoin.
Perhaps 1-2% are "whales" with significant holdings 
At full power we would be something like .5% of the total market. Even coordinated, it is unlikely we would have a total 10,000 bitcoins, and even less that we would "play with" in a stunt or meme-up
Best we could do is crash some alts by mass selling in a coordinated fashioin into bitcoin from all alts, causing a huge reduciton in total number of bitcoin for a short time. timed right, it could push bitcoin a few percent or more, it's plausible, if you want to play the devils advocate, there are certainly super whales who could drop 10,000 bitcoins for sale right now and the price would fall to 6k in 10 minutes, where he'd probably buy back at a 20% position gain of course

@_date: 2017-11-27 18:21:16
My prediction for next month is 10-14k.
it was in the news recently that less than .1% of people have adopted bitcoin. That news comes from this source document:
It claims that of the 250trillion dollars in liquidity globally, that the current crypto market is, at only 250billion total, only .1% or 1/1000th of the total possible cap. 
What this means is this: of the 250trillion investment dollars out there in the total aggregate global earth market, only 1 in a 1000 is using bitcoins in their portfolio. 
So, of the investors only, and not the wider general population, bitcoin is an asset with only .1% capitalization. Actually less, as bitcoin was only 150billion of the total crypto 250billion market cap, that is, until 2 days ago, when coinbase recorded 100000 new users in a day and the market rose 10billion dollars and the price moved from 8k to 9.7k. So, actually, the adoption rate of crypto is about .11%, and so bitcoin is only .07% of the global market, now that some growth has happened in the last few days on top of my numbers. Towards my numbers. 
From this knowledge, it's just supply and demand relationships driving the price from x-y. using aggregate and averaged data, the price will rise to 14k-90k over 2018.
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:20:01
You aren't considering that the adoption rate and therefore demand is reaching upwards of .1% of people.
Since there are a limited number of bitcoins, you will see the only parameter which can move is the price going up.
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:52:53
because the adoption rate is only .11%, growing by ten percent into .12%. only a few million people use this. it's not a stock so it can't bubble. it's a currency, like paypal, except instead of being tied to fiat minus fees and with loss of control, you get international exhchange, universal prices. the reason it's going up is instead of being printed infinitely like money, it was mined from a limited supply. so even though the adoption rate of money is high, they keep printing it so it keeps deflating in value and inflating prices, where as bitcoin is the opposite. there is a fixed amount, even though more and more people are using it and over the long term are also being born. this means the price can only ever go up. rather, i should say the value can only ever go up, in comparison to shitty dollars or other fiat. it's likely to be earth's first global currency. like coka cola is earths drink and Disney is earths childhood, the mona lisa was smiling at Satoshi. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:27:12
Out of 250 trillion in all market caps globally, only .1% of that is in bitcoin. Not everyone is an investor. Most peoples money is in checking and savings accounts, 401ks, mattresses, gift cards, paypal balances, etcetera. 
All of these $250 trillion dollar in traditional and who knows how much in pocket change type assets will be converted to liquid cash supposedly in some market at some time at some rate with some fee or taxes in some cases. It will exchange for goods and services eventually, because it's a currency in any of those forms. it has no real property value as an account balance, it MUST be exchanged for a good or service or other real property.
enter bitcoin. bitcoin is like the dollar, as far as it is a currency, you can use it to purchase goods and services. where it diverges is it's form as a blockchain technology which provides flexible decentralization and a fixed supply, rather than as a paper rectangle which provides constant inflation over time, the simple function of bitcoin over population shows that it is superior to traditional value stores. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:17:25
futures will be more money buying more bitcoins. it will bring more users, transactions, and reduce supply, raising price. 
no matter what, price goes up.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:16:58
The adoption rate IS growing to hundreds of millions, 
Not my opinion, any chart will show the same data. 
Spouting bullshit?
This is happening in real time and people want an explanation. Can you provide an explanation for the growth other than the adoption rate?
Claiming it can go up or down is just stating the obvious. I understand the desire and altruism of playing devils advocate, but can you explain why the adoption rate would halt then reverse versus accelerate up? 
Look at dogecoin charts. That is a dead coin. there is no exponential growth charted there. look at bitcoin all time. it looks just like an exponentiual curve. If you tick it forward1 month, then 2 months, then 3 months, you don't see any volatilty, see no loss, only see adoption rate growth, market cap growth, price growth. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:10:14
Well, what about this situation:


Less than .1% of people are using this medium. When the market cap accepts some portion of the remaining 99.9%' cash toward remaining bitcoins, what will the price be like? Won't they have to hit something like 1.2 million? this will be the case over the next 5 years, just like the last 7 years. 
Buy now, while it's still only a 4 digit cost. This will be unheard of come this time next year, when you are facing down 80k-140k bitcoins. I expect 14k by january 2018 simply beaise of the movements of the pensions and the futures and the constant growing rate of adopters. plus wall street is interested, and more outlets are accepting them for payment. it's a magical time. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:22:07
follow up: show me a year over year in all of bitcoin history where you would have made a loss? this is like if you could have bought apple stock at the IPO. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:48:29
so it stands to reason that eventually that holding pattern will wear off for a majority of people and there will be a humongous crash one day, too. 
At which point I will buy!
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:21:28
I believe the adoption rate will grow exponentially and that the price will grow logarithmically.

I'm pretty sure it's going to 90k by summer. You should understand the fundamental situation we are in right now as holders of any of the cryptocurrencies:

ok, yes, but if this happens, it would be in the news, the press releases, and the blogosphere for months before taking affect and you would have all the time in the world to make an instant trade out of bitcoin into litecoin or whatever. No one forces you to hold. Right now the situation is not bad. Everything is good. there are no real flaws. no real competition. so holding is the right thing to do. if that changed because of new tech and the whole market was like, yeah, lets do that instead, then you would know to move out of bitcoin into Xcoin.

Every time the bubble burst, it was later proven to be FUD and FOMO of weak hands who lost out on a simple correction always thinking it's a collapse. remember, millions of bitcoin were sold for a dollar or two. It's not a bubble until the price overshoots the adoption rate. Right now, there is a 99.9% chance that isn't happening, since the adoption rate is exponentially growing and less than .11% of people are using it.

apple is a stock, it's limited in value by the amount of products and services it can produce. it can't reach the full money market cap because apple stock isn't money, it's a commodity you buy with money. 
bitcoin is money. bitcoin can absorb all of the money, the way cash and credit cards and bank balances and paypal balances all absorb money.
with bitcoin, we are talking about simply converting cash to bitcoin. right now you can convert cash to paypal balance or cash to debit card balance etcetera. nobody accepts apple stock as payment. the price rise comes from the scarcity of bitcoin. Stock has no scarcity, you print how ever much you wanted and then do splits if you wanted more. with cash, it's the same way, print out as much as you want. 
with bitcoin, there is a fixed supply. if the supply weren't fixed, like a gift card isn't fixed supply, then the price of a bitcoin would simply be 1$ in and $1 out. 
but since there are holders, and some coins were lost, and not all coins were mined yet, and because of the vast gap between money adoption versus bitcoin adoption, there is scarcity of bitcoins to go around versus the dollar. 
so the price rises
none of this happens with apple stock, because for apple stock to rise it has to sell more than it did last year. for it to fall it simply needs people to sell it's stock over the buy bid market, leading to undercutting and falling prices, oir for the same amount or less of people to buy it's products each fiscal year.
but the whole time they are using money, the medium of exchange, not the product being exchanged.
its extremely different and not subtle, so I don't know why I get asked this question so often. thanks for taking the time to learn

I sold all my bitcoin for Einsteinium 30 days ago, which then grew 70% in less then a week last week and the day after I sold back into bitcoin the price rose to 9700 and held at 9500. 
My next move was into monero, where I hope to both dodge the bitcoin correction to 8000s over the next 2 weeks and reconvert back at some factor over the moment it begins to rise again, only to hold until the end of january 2018 or perhaps April for the next checkpoint at 14-40k mid year. i'll then dodge into ripple, which only days later will grow from 40 cents to over $7 as people start to worry and weak hands stop holding and diversify. I'll have at least 10% of my portfolio in ethereum and ardor at all times.

I mean, I guess if you like advertising disguised as content, and reposts plaigiarism presented as original content, and inane pun threads replacing discussion of the topic, then by all means enjoy reddit as the progressive censorship forum that it is. 
But if you ever surfed the web before you got into high school, you'd know that it used to be full of communities of experts who demonstrate value and provide sources and links, and trolls and flame wars were for sport, not the peak discourse.
For $200 I can call reddit up and shove any message I want down your throat, and you'll upvote it. So from my perspective, this whole site is trash, lost to eternal september and cam whores and reposts and to time as people like you shit it up with 3 word comments about their opinions, like pissing into the ocean would make it wet.

Impossible. You should understand the fundamental situation we are in right now as holders of any of the cryptocurrencies:


The growth you've seen was that number coming from .00000001% (nearly a billionth) of first-worlders to the present .1%. Remember, 10,000 bitcoins would have hardly bought you a pizza when the adoption rate was so low.  
The reason is simple: supply and demand. There are a limited supply of the cryptocurrencies, and therefore with an increasing adoption rate, there must be skyrocketing prices until it reaches it's true value, somewhere around $1M USD estimated to be about 2023-2025 by the current growth charts extrapolations by trends. This assumes 25% of westerners use the coin, with average holdings of $1000. This is a several trillion dollar market cap increase projection from current $250 billion market cap in a short time. It's a literal digital gold rush, and right now, you are in the first .11% of people to get on board. 
Tomorrow, it will be a .12% saturation. That's already another 8-10% growth in your portfolio, just from holding, as your coin gets rarer. Imagine another year of adoption rate. Go to your favorite exchange and look at what a million people with a thousand dollars ( a billion dollars) would do to the price.
Then times it by ten. 
Bitcoin isn't going to 9k. Bitcoin is going to 90k now through spring. It will probably break the $400k barrier by August or September 2018 as the adoption rate reaches the .2%-.4% saturation. The market cap should surge from $250 billion to $2.2-2.5 trillion by then. This is about a 1/4th of the global gold market cap. Which performs at a few percent a year, eaten mostly by fees and brokers. Bitcoin's growth is very attractive, and the Fear of Missing Out may be powerful enough to accelerate these projections, but there is no doubt they are steps along the way to something like PayPal's adoption rate, which is around what, 35% saturation? Could you imagine if bitcoin reached an adoption rate of 35%, over the .1% current? That's 350 times growth, 350000%. Probably a 3-5 year plan for a bitcoin holder. 
That's what's happening: the adoption rate is growing everyday, as well as the market cap, versus a limited number of coins.

If the internet provides global ecommerce and paypal provides global payment escrow, then using bitcoin is like removing all the middlemen and their fees. It's better. It's the next step of money. It allows for universal prices, and a liquidity even cash can't provide, especially in a commercial sense. 
yes, bitcoin, or at least some crypto, will be the model for a global unified currency.

Yes, because your housing or stock market crashes will be outside of the bitcoin ecosphere, where as the dollar being traded for bitcoins would not be. If your house is over valued to the dollar, that is a bubble. But if your house is not overvalued, then it is not a bubble. 
Bitcoin is more like a cross between gold coins and cash than it is strictly gold or cash. its sold on an exchange but it is not a stock. stocks are portions of companies. there is no bitcoin company to have a stock in. stock markets don't affect bitcoin, rather, stock markets affect dollars which can be traded for bitcoins.

gdax is too restrictive in teh currency it trades so I use poloniex, which carries like 70 coins. 
i recommend bitcoin, ethereum, monero, and ripple in that order. ripple is especially primed to raise from 24 cents to over $10 in the near future. ethereum should hit 600 in the next 90 days. Monero is likely to hit 300-500 by the end of spring. 
these predictions are only postponable if bitcoin moons real hard, absorbing the bulk of the trade volume and basically delaying their growth to t he late summer at worst.

You're leaving out the store of value function. Most of the actual bitcoins are in cold storage. Large holdings with no liquidity. Because they don't provide liquidity, only a store of value easier to handle than gold, this portion of the coins is not available to markets, exchanges, or daily transactions. This extra layer of artificial growth is compounded by the fact that not all coins will have been mined by then, and further compounded by the 4 million coins which were lost. 
The scarcity is actually higher for these reasons, implying growth. But this is at a nearly 75% global adoption rate. Right now, the goal is to hit somewhere around 10% from the current .11%. This growth will bring us between 90k-415k over the next calendar  year, assuming adoption rate stays the same daily rate, with no large increases.

It's because bitcoin is the original and has the most momentum that it is the king crypto at this time. 
There won't be 40 equal priced cryptos, but there are already 40 equally great ones. But they solve smaller niches. For example, we are used to microsoft points on Xbox live. This is an altcoin just like the currency in your favorite game is. But when you're done with that game, what happens to all of the value you acquired? Usually it's lost. 
Enter XRP. Ripple. Ripple aims to make in-game currency-cross-platform with real currency. Sell your wow gold and buy back into hearthstone card packs! Sell your bottlecap collection from Fallout and buy gold for your character in skyrim. Sell your legendary Destiny gun for XRP and use the credits to pay for a new game, or sell your XRP into cash or bitcoin. Place bets on esports without a credit card using ripple. All cool stuff bitcoin can already do, but on a different layer. 
That's just one example, loosely based. 
Transaction times will probably be solved by simply adding a second layer to bitcoin, probably using something like monero or ripple as a process in parrallel.

im not sure amazon has published figures of it's sales in bitcoin, but there are many outlets using and accepting bitcoin, it's just in the early stages. Right now, there is no killer app, that is being developed. 
The killer app is replacing currency. We already saw the push with apple pay, android pay, chips in credit cards for tap and go, NFC support, and blah blah blah. All of that is unneccessary and obsolete on bitcoin network. The specific why of it all is what is a mystery to me. 
For example, what is the main reason people would want to spend bitcoin versus their paypal? It doesn't make a difference. But flip it around, as a seller, which would you prefer? paypal and credit companies charge something like 3-5% for a transaction plus a minimum fee. as a merchant, selling on the bitcoin payment network entitles you to charge lower prices by the fees you save. and as a merchant, if you decide to longer accept paypal or square type fees, then you will push consumers to use the more modern, lower fee, bitcoins. So I think in t his way that ecommerce moving from traditional payment networks will be the first killer app, because they will be providing the goods and services that bitcoins will be spent on. 
It is a good point that adoption rate has exceeded the use-case scenario rate, however, this will not cause a collapse, only a correction between whatever peak adoption is versus peak-merchant-acceptance. 
Once peak merchant acceptance is reached, or at least a critical mass, adoption rate will also increase, providing a recursive growth effect toward max. 
I honestly wonder if 1$million bitcoins might arrive before 2025, maybe even in 2020-2022. It's staggering.

when the adoption rate of bitcoin is 25% of people and volume is in the trillions then bitcoins will be worth about $400,000 current year US dollars each. Of course, within about 10 years, the $100 US Note will depreciate to about $65 through depreciation by then, but most people won't be using the dollar. They will be using a crypto of one type or the other. I'm holding until the late 2020s, when Teslas actually do fly and bitcoin finally matures. 
Right now, even if you get in next week, you are still in the first 1% of early adopters.

Well, they effect the market for an hour or two and do cause movements but they are always corrected over time. They can't keep it up and it gets harder as the adoption rate continues. That's another main reason that bitcoin is so preferred to other alts: it's repetitively sustained attacks of all types and has survived and grown despite it. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:07:41
no, that's the maximum global adoption rate potential by some time in the future. but along the way that implies growth next year of about the 14-90k range. 
growth every year
The smartphones adoption rate happened in a shorter time than the adoption of electricity, television, or even the internet. 
bitcoin is working, and its not like anything before, these are all just analogies. thats why it's important to focus on fundamentals, like adoption rate versus supply. 
do you agree or disagree that the adoption rate will grow in 2018?
If you agree, doesn't that imply the price will reach X growth? And I provide a figure from 50% to 10x growth over the course of the next year. I even provide a fundamental reason.

Horse adoption rate is dead, versus cars. 
Cash adoption rate is dead, versus debit cards.
Cable adoption rate is dead versus youtube and netflix. 
You might be an anecdotal rare exception trying to be funny, but that doesn't change that you are wrong because you misunderstood the underlying fundamental principle
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:15:03
yeah guys, you have to understand the fundamental situation we are in right now as holders of any of the cryptocurrencies:


The growth you've seen was that number coming from .00000001% (nearly a billionth) of first-worlders to the present .1%. Remember, 10,000 bitcoins would have hardly bought you a pizza when the adoption rate was so low.  
The reason is simple: supply and demand. There are a limited supply of the cryptocurrencies, and therefore with an increasing adoption rate, there must be skyrocketing prices until it reaches it's true value, somewhere around $1M USD estimated to be about 2023-2025 by the current growth charts extrapolations by trends. This assumes 25% of westerners use the coin, with average holdings of $1000. This is a several trillion dollar market cap increase projection from current $250 billion market cap in a short time. It's a literal digital gold rush, and right now, you are in the first .11% of people to get on board. 
Tomorrow, it will be a .12% saturation. That's already another 8-10% growth in your portfolio, just from holding, as your coin gets rarer. Imagine another year of adoption rate. Go to your favorite exchange and look at what a million people with a thousand dollars ( a billion dollars) would do to the price.
Then times it by ten. 
Bitcoin isn't going to 9k. Bitcoin is going to 90k now through spring. It will probably break the $400k barrier by August or September 2018 as the adoption rate reaches the .2%-.4% saturation. The market cap should surge from $250 billion to $2.2-2.5 trillion by then. This is about a 1/4th of the global gold market cap. Which performs at a few percent a year, eaten mostly by fees and brokers. Bitcoin's growth is very attractive, and the Fear of Missing Out may be powerful enough to accelerate these projections, but there is no doubt they are steps along the way to something like PayPal's adoption rate, which is around what, 35% saturation? Could you imagine if bitcoin reached an adoption rate of 35%, over the .1% current? That's 350 times growth, 350000%. Probably a 3-5 year plan for a bitcoin holder. 
That's what's happening: the adoption rate is growing everyday, as well as the market cap, versus a limited number of coins.

OK, let me ask you in a different way, is cash flowing into a paypal account a bubble? Because you can withdraw it anytime, I'd say it's not an investment.
Is cash going into your checking account a bubble? Because you can withdraw it anytime, I'd say it's not an investment.
Now, Cash going into stocks can be a bubble, because the value of the company stocks can rise higher than the value of the products and services they create. Thats a bubble. 
Bitcoin is the opposite. The value it creates is higher and higher as the adoption rate increases. The value of bitcoin is as a virtually feeless banking and low fee international transaction platform that escapes exchanges and bank fees and holds and scrutiny, and restores some privacy to finance.
It's not a bubble because the value of bitcoin is extremely higher than the current price. 
The internet brought us a type 1 civilization global hivemind telephone internet system. It's reduced the global culture to a monoculture uniting human knowledge. No one argues the value of the internet. 
The bitcoin is bringing us a type 1 civilization global currency and payment blockchain platform. It's reducing the global currency exchange mess into a unified Earth Coin and displacing traditional banking and finance.

I recommend splitting your holdings in either coin between the two, and holding for a day. trying to ride the roller coaster will leave you suicidal as the volume of transactions often freeze exchanges at these peaks and you won't even have enough time for your stop limits trade to go off, and you will lose. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:30:41
very unlikely. It is highly recommended to hold 80/20 in cold storage and exchanges. trading takes instant response times and you can't see an opportunity and respond from cold storage before that opportunity would have passed

You must not know what bitcoin does. 
Bitcoin provides private transactions across international borders without taxes or fees from middlemen or exchanges. It allows transfer or funds without going through the ACH bank layer and being scrutinized and slowed. This may not matter to you, but to billions of people on earth, this is the first time in history that a financial instrument wasn't being used against them . 
Bitcoin offers a store of value, similar to removing your money from a bank and placing it into a gold deposit. It is sold on a market between miners and adopters like a stock exchange, but it is not a stock, There is no central entity that can determine the value, only the market determines the value. Gold requires safes and guards and security to manage and hold, which is all expensive. bitcoin can all fit on a sheet of paper or a thumb drive. 
the value of cash is constantly going down because it is constantly being printed out of thin air. cash is a bubble, constantly falling in value since the 1930s.
Bitcoin has constantly rose in value. This is because the service and features of bitcoin are becoming more accepted, more trusted, and more widely adopted, as well as more useful. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:27:19
you must be missing the fundamental situation we are in right now, as the adoption rate is only .11% on the way to 10-25% adoption rate. What is the current price times 1000x to 2500x demand on a limited supply?
Looks like it will be millions, but I adjusted the price back because it is true that weak hands will cash at and undercut the rising price along the way, overall slowing the growth rate in price. But these undercutters will dry up in the face of ever increasing adoption rates and ever dwindling supplies. I reservedly and conservatively estimate only 90-400k in the next year, but I cautiously respect that 1-2 million per bitcoin is a real price target by the mid 2020s at the latest,

100,000 people made new coinbase accounts. If you average a $1000 each investment, that's a billion dollars coming online. The market cap is only 150billion. 
When I go on poloniex exchange, I see barely 1400 bitcoins versus 25 million dollars in liquidity market. When a billion dollars hits that, the price rises 500-700. 
That just happened this week, and the weeks before it. It's been happening for 5 years.

I know one thing that you don't know: the adoption rate will grow from a few million people to hundreds of million of people, and the money they bring into the market will drive the price up, not down,
so if you disagree about how much the price goes up, do you also disagree that the price goes up with the adoption rate?
do you also disagree that the price goes up when the market cap goes up?

i get your point but this is one where that's not a safe bet. At any date in the last that you put $100 in, you would havemore money today. and tomorrow. until the adoption rate levels off to about the same as cash and the futures market quiets down and the liquidity evens out, the price will not genuinely fall. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:49:23
These are extrememly conservative estimates. I mean, paypal has more like a 50% adoption rate. third worlders can adopt the coin as well. people can put more than 1000/each into the currency. and more contributers, such as transaction rates and liquidity growing as a percentage essentially removes coin from the market during the transaction.
i could be dead wrong. bitcoin could reach 5 million USD/each instead of 1-1.2M.

There are a limited supply of the cryptocurrencies, and therefore with an increasing adoption rate, there must be skyrocketing prices until it reaches it's true value, somewhere around $1M USD estimated to be about 2023-2025 by the current growth charts extrapolations by trends. This assumes 25% of westerners use the coin, with average holdings of $1000. This is a several trillion dollar market cap increase projection from current $250 billion market cap in a short time. It's a literal digital gold rush, and right now, you are in the first .11% of people to get on board. 
Tomorrow, it will be a .12% saturation. That's already another 8-10% growth in your portfolio, just from holding, as your coin gets rarer. Imagine another year of adoption rate. Go to your favorite exchange and look at what a million people with a thousand dollars ( a billion dollars) would do to the price.
Then times it by ten. 
Bitcoin isn't going to 9k. Bitcoin is going to 90k now through spring. It will probably break the $400k barrier by August or September 2018 as the adoption rate reaches the .2%-.4% saturation. The market cap should surge from $250 billion to $2.2-2.5 trillion by then. This is about a 1/4th of the global gold market cap. Which performs at a few percent a year, eaten mostly by fees and brokers. Bitcoin's growth is very attractive, and the Fear of Missing Out may be powerful enough to accelerate these projections, but there is no doubt they are steps along the way to something like PayPal's adoption rate, which is around what, 35% saturation? Could you imagine if bitcoin reached an adoption rate of 35%, over the .1% current? That's 350 times growth, 350000%. Probably a 3-5 year plan for a bitcoin holder. 
That's what's happening: the adoption rate is growing everyday, as well as the market cap, versus a limited number of coins.

But we're not talking about a stock in a stock exchange. We're talking about a cryptocurrency on a global stage. 
If you need an analogy, this is like when the wheel was invented. Despite the different types of spokes and hub caps and finishes, they are all round, and the adoption rate was essentially 100%. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:13:29
it's going to 14k after a dip at 9k to 8200 right before christmas. then the day of after it will go straight to 8-18k, which implies a recovery and an overshoot as people invest for the future while thinking of family. 
bitcoin has never not gained 1000% in a year. but that growth could easily be another 2000% or 4000%. Less than 1% of people on earth use this. Only just this month were huge $100+billion dollar firms confirming their move to bitcoin. your 401k in bitcoin last year would be worth 5-8 times as much this year as it is sitting there. Bitcoin is rarer than gold. if you have gold or silver, dump it. space mining and strip mining will cause huge losses in holders of those assets, nevermind the fees. in bitcoin, the asset is rarer by orders of magnitude. it can't be mined in the traditional sense. it's value is a function of adoption rate and supply. because adoption rate is always going up and demand therefore goes up but supply stays the same then the price must be the variable which moves, and always up, until the adoption rate reaches it's maximum. 
If you can do the math, or if you can't and you are in doubt, just go to any chart and zoom out. 
bitcoin bought at any date is always worth more in any future amount of time.
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:31:04
Ok, so I guess the last people to ever adopt bitcoin already have, and the last price movement up is yesterday, and everyone is holding a coin falling in value right now, panic selling the best they can in a dead market that has no prospects, developments, investors, news coverage, social media momentum, viral marketing, or true believers left?
Hard to argue with that.

the dude needs to open a chain restaurant like a subway with a small margin and pay himself two salaries and a profit as a sole owner. run it into the ground then sell it after 5 years when the leases are up for a profit to the next investor. go into real estate. use the money to get into &lt;new coin of year 2023&gt;. hold until 2028 and be a quadrillionaire.

ok, lets say its the worst case scenario, and you work min wage and live at home. your bills are light. you could afford about 75$ a week, or $300 a month toward a bill. Not enough for rent or a car, but enough to invest in bitcoin. Put the $300 in bitcoin? Hell no. Take out a loan!
When you get the loan, say its for a car you or a parent already already own. Whatever, just get the loan. Get upwards of 8-10k financed for $250-$325 a month as a "car loan".
Put the entire thing into the bitcoins and only hold them for one calendar year. After one calendar year, expect 800-1600% returns. This estimate comes from the last 5 years of Year over Year YoY data available to check on any exchange.
You can now either pay off the remaining loan in full, or continue making the payments for one more year. Leverage the $64k-160k for another year or pay off the remaining $7000 loan after one year. 
This is where it gets hard. Do you wait the full next calendar year and reap the 250k-400k bitcoin rate on that extra $7k or not, knowing it's got another 4000x growth in the next 2 years, based on the last 7 years?
or do you pay off the loan and miss out on a few hundred thousand dollars growth?
this is where people mess up. when they cash out. watining another year will bring bitcoin up to another factor of growth. imagine, it's the year 2021 and bitcoin is $1.2m, adoption rate is still only 5-10% of global population. self driving space lambos have built in college educations. the market cap is now a trillion instead of the paltry 250 billion of 2017. the global market cap is measured in the quadrillions, and bitcoin still has a 1000% more growth left. By 2022-2023, bitcoin would be worth 800m- $1 billion each, global adoption rate close to 20-25%. Holders from the Plebeian era will be able to pay off their students loans, and Americans their medical bills. People will still say it's a bubble. But there will be more billionaires in 5 years then there ever were throughout all of history. .

You are right about the 217 trillion real estate market. But, You're analysis is describing markets. Not all of the real estate is on the market, not all has been developed. Vast swarms of africa and north america are still pasture. They could be strip malls or housing. That hasn't happened yet, but the population is going to grow to 12 billion in the next 10 years. There is a bigger picture we are not focusing on for simplicity. I understand you seeking details and clarification. 
You are neglecting all economic contributors: third world growth into first world. new technological sectors. population growth. financial instruments. research and developments. 
One example: Tesla comes out with a self driving car, and a self landing rocket. And they use the rocket to self deliver self-driving mining equipment to some planet or moon. They send back quadrillions of dollars of refined ore. 
Along the way, trillion dollar markets are created in self driving component technologies, off world technologies and access and eventually tourism, and new materials, increasing the earths net value. 
Then there is bio. Genetic engineering has the capability to produce market sectors in designer babies, disease elimination, gender selection, cancer cures, body modification for aesthetuic and commercial applications. 
Then there is energy sector. Leisure sector. Hobby sector. Education, travel, finance, sports, etcetera. All being constantly disrupted and grown with technology. 
Todays earth market cap is only a few quadrillion dollars counting all deriviatives, and off market assets.
The projections are sound. They predict that the global market will grow. It's not static. It's bigger than it was 30 years ago. It will be much bigger in another 30 years. Bitcoin is a symptom of modernization, not a cause.

Yes, that's per coin at full adoption rate. In the farther future, the adoption rate will slow to only growing with the birth rate. In the farther future, deaths will take a lot of bitcoins to the graves with them, eliminating them from circulation and supply, which will also affect the price upwards in the long run. But the coin should stabilize to somewhere around 100million USDT each as it fully matures and replaces cash, euros, marks, yen, etcetera.

Speaking of fundamentals, it should be understood that the fundamental situation we are in right now as holders of any of the cryptocurrencies is unprecedented:


The growth you've seen was that number coming from .00000001% (nearly a billionth) of first-worlders to the present .1%. Remember, 10,000 bitcoins would have hardly bought you a pizza when the adoption rate was so low.

The value is in the market cap, the actual real dollars and other currencies placed into bitcoin and ourchased from the miners. The miners made their money already, less than 20% remain to be mined, yet the price is rising. You don't know what but I do: it's the fucking adoption rate!
It used to be a few guys, then a few thousand, then ten thousand, then a million, now several million, eventually a hundred million, all putting their real currencies into bitcoins and making transactions. 
This is the market cap naturally growing from the adoption rate. Meanwhile, scarcity means the value must go up from supply and demand. It's not value from the miners, yet miners had value in the beginning: each coin cost hardware, time, and electricity. The whole concept is proof of work, and costs. They weren't speculating, they were early adopters. You can still mine! You can skip all that and buy in before the other 99% of the adoption rate potential of the earth catches on. Eventually once the adoption rate settles, so will the rising value of the coin. Speculators using past trends and extrapolating expect bitcoins to exceed $100,000 each by like, 2030 or so, give or take whatever spikes in the adoption rate happen along the way. Maybe they're overestimating, but most of these estimates are actually very conservative. My calculations show about 60k per bitcoin by 2030. Others are saying it could become adopted to 50% penetration essentially overnight, much like social media and the smartphone and color tv had before it. It could hit $100,000 by the end of 2019 if more companies and countries and investment firms move their capital into bitcoin, moving trillions of dollars into the bitcoin market cap and raising the value a decade early on their own. 
In some cases, we will actually see the term "overnight trillionaires".
It sounds like a scam, but if 6 billion other people suddenly start wanting something and just you few millions of people have 3 or 4 each, I promise you will sell when buy bids on the exchange start showing 5 digits, then 6. That's what competition in the market will look like, same as rushes to any other trillion dollar industry will look like, like the one going on into space, on the level 5 autonomous roads, and the drone delivery, all emerging trillion dollar markets. People flock to buy in, to, and from these things, just like they did electricity and the modern roads. Bitcoin will blend into society. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 03:20:00
Wow, that is an extremely narrow view and misses the larger game of buyers and users and holders of the currency. But you are right in your analysis of miners. Miners produced the coins and early miners produced coins easier, BUT:
Look, if you aren't in bitcoin now, then when you get in and use it to spend, it's worth what you put in, no ups or down.
If you put cash in today, it's worth exactly what you put in. Spend it and you're done. Your transaction fee was smaller than paypal and the ATM. Isn't bitcoin fucking awesome! And no one knows you bought heroin and dildos and all the other stuff you can find on sites like Amazon around the net because it's a nameless transaction.
Meanwhile, there is an increasing yet fluctuating adoption rate in the background, where more and more retailers and users are preferring or accepting or trying and experimenting with bitcoin.
Every time someone adds more money of any global currency into the limited supply of bitcoin, they are buying it from someone else who originally mined it using hardware and electricity through an exchange at the current price. More users for the same amount of bitcoins means the value overall goes up. That is a basic principle of supply and demand on an item with scarcity.
This is where the dollar and the bitcoin diverge.
The dollar decreases in value every year, because it is printed out and not fixed to any commodity, so it has no scarcity. there is essentially limitless paper and ink in the world. On the other hand, there are only a handfull millions of bitcoins, and they are not region locked like a currency.
Meanwhile, teh bitcoin increases in value every year. So far, part of that is a bubble from speculation and a result of artificial supply bottlenecks and liquidity restrictions from hloders within the market....
BUT there is also the overall year to year growth from the increasing adoption rate, and this increasing adoption rate is where people from different countries buy some bitcoin from the supply and spend all or some or hold it, which overall leaves only an ever smaller portion of bitcoins available for newcomers buying from the pool of bitcoins with their new paper currency. Because there is scarcity caused by the stationary units of bitcoins and an increasing adoption rate, the overall trend over longer periods of time is always up, from the weight of new currency removing more and more bitcoins as will the waves after them.
Because the current adoption rate is a few million people, perhaps a single percent globally, you can safely conclude that if the bitcoin adoption rate became, say, 10% globally, say 700 million people, that you would expect a leftover bitcoin in your account from 2017 to be worth that same magnitude more by about 2020, give or take the fluctuations and bubble effects you see in the charts on the short term. Not a scam. Not a pyramid scheme. Supply and demand. Like gold backed dollars were, or gold itself. But no transaction fees above the spot price. No checking account fees. No 3% transaction fees. No international currency exchange fees. No taxes on purchases and sales unless agreed by both parties. Instant transfers (compared to ACH credits and the other traditional financial instruments)
If the 2017 price is fluctuating between $2200 and $4400, you can just about guarantee (speculation based on historical trends) that it reach between $20,000 and $50,000 at the same time it's adoption rate reaches that 10x benchmark from 1% adoption rate of today to 10% adoption rate.
Or 12%, where bitcoin is worth over $60k.
Or why not 20% adoption rate?
This is what hodlers know that you don't and this is why it's value goes up without being a scam. I hope you also purchase some ethereum because it's going to overcome bitcoin in the long term, and it's at a 8% the price of bitcoin right now. Your thousand bucks today could be worth a house in the next 5 years. It would have been worth 1000 houses if you spent that 1000$ 10 years ago. This is what the adoption rate curve looks like. Feel free to go to your favorite exchange and look at the chart sorted by all time.
I'll wait. You can't miss what an exponential growth curve looks like. You haven't seen anything yet. They say "to the moon" all the time because when we're all trillionaires our only problem will be deciding which color space-lambos to drive on the moon.
It's funny this still has to be explained after ten years, but here we are, and I don't really mind making a few billion/trillionaires in my wake. You're welcome new guys, and welcome to the show. Don't forget me, this is no bullshit! I just made the bet a winning bet. Don't go into 2018 without a bitcoin in your pocket! You were warned!
