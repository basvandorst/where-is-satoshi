I think that governments will try to make bitcoin illegal.  I expect it, it's an inevitability.  But the more people who know what a bitcoin his, who have heard it mentioned in mainstream fora, who have some familiarity with it--the more resistance there will be.  Let's not be innocent about it, bitcoin *is* a way to rebel.  It's a just rebellion and a righteous one; the right to a sound currency and to free trade should be inviolable.  This show was extremely positive, and an accurate representation of the cryptocurrency zeitgeist.  It met all of my expectations--exceeded them, actually.

Considering the high number of seemingly reputable, secure websites that have been pillaged by hackers, I don't think any site, even Mt. Gox is deserving of an assumption of security.   I hope bitcoin replaces our entire monetary system, but it's not going to happen until a lot improves with the security of third-party service providers.  Out of curiosity, what percentage of Mt. Gox users do you think have a yubikey?  Also, for my understanding, does having a yubikey prevent you from losing bitcoins in the event that Mt. Gox's servers/site are hacked?  What about if their offline storage is stolen?

I don't think Mt. Gox can be presumed bulletproof.  Extreme caution is needed with all things bitcoin and users need to protect themselves.  Mt. Gox wouldn't offer a yubikey if there wasn't need for it.  Mt. Gox is only as strong as its encryption and storage mechanisms.  Users are only as secure as their passwords are unique and complex.  A bitcoin is just a password or a hashkey away from having all your assets be belong to some other guy.  Bitcoin itself is secure (minus 51% attacks).  Everything else is swirling in the wind.  User beware.  Note, I own bitcoins and I still say this is true.

Imagine there's a computer program that stores what everyone in the world is buying and selling.  The program is as secure as anything that the CIA has ever used, and the best hackers in the world haven't been able to penetrate its security.  
Now, any time I send or receive money, the computer program records it.  The computer program is not running in any central place, it's spread out across an entire network, just like the internet.  No one can shut down this computer program, because doing so would mean shutting down hundreds of thousands of individual computers.
Because the money is stored in a computer program, I can send it from me to you as easily as sending an email.  I can literally 'email' you money, for no fee.  That means that Western Union, with their $7 per $100 dollar charge is out of business.  So is Visa, Mastercard, and American Express, at least the parts that do debits and not credits.  Gone, overnight.  
Because the currency is digital (computerized), I can break it into theoretically infinitely small pieces.  I can use it to buy real goods and services from anyone who accepts the currency.  The more people who accept it, the more value the currency has.  It's as simple as that:  it has value because people accept it.
The currency also cannot be counterfeited.  That security I mentioned before is so secure that it can't be cracked.  It's like a gold bar--you can't just make gold from nothing or from another material.  The same is true of bitcoin, it can't be made from anything else, except through the secure, unhackable computer program.

If difficulty is low does that make attacks easier, e.g. 51%

Not to dance on your funeral here, but it needs to be said:  No one should have money in bitcoins that they can't afford to lose.  This is still a speculative wild-west with many known and still unknown fault points.

It's cleverly designed but has a huge anonymity flaw--not the typical criticism that it's anonymous but that once your address is known your entire transaction history is public.  If there was a way that this could have been reduced or obscured, I wonder why it's not being done.

Mr. Bitcoin!

What incentivizes the work, without mining rewards?

Even then, Mt. Gox's records could be subpoenaed and there'd be a way to fill the A-B B-C gap.  Unless perhaps you had two different Mt. Gox accounts that you accessed through proxies.

This is a spectacularly level-headed, lucid, and brief overview of the whole shebang.  Highly recommended reading.
