 If was making a general claim about the universe yeah there’s basically infinite resources I guess

When’s the last time satoshis Wallet moved coins?
@_date: 2019-10-01 16:53:33
I guess but with the increased infrastructure as well as the coming halvening it’s definitely going to go somewhere

I managed to by most Under 10k but I did buy a decent amount when we were at like 12 or 13k so that definitely throws it off

Yeah I’m not really watching charts rn just price averaging
@_date: 2019-10-23 17:19:28
I doubt we’re ever going south of 5k ever again

Yeah but bitcoin is also only 10 years old and after 21 million coins there’s not gunna be any more. Any time you have a currency you need some form of inflation for some period or there won’t be enough of the currency in circulation to be used

I sold basically all my alts tbh. Was tired of them lacking behind btc
