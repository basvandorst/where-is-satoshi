Don't worry facebook will kill itself. It's a fad. And it's supposedly a successful company because it pays huge premiums to buy up up and coming fads. All of which have peaked in popularity and profitability. I can't wait for the social media boom to bust.

A few months ago was the right time to buy.

Or it's close to the holidays?

What does lock/unlock mean? If I sent $15 worth of bitcoin to my Coinapult account, then sent it back to my normal account, am I in the contest?

Move some btc to Coinapult for the contest. BTC price makes a big move upward. I'm cursed.

What he's really saying is that you're not rich enough to avoid paying taxes.

I'm not even that big of a fan of bitcoin, but this insane short-sighted mania for Ethereum is ridiculous. The bubble popped, it's downhill from here.

More like the Bull Trap.

Oh, reddit is down momentarily? Try another website instead so you don't miss out on an hour max of posting/reading.

Interesting that the price jumped right before this auction. Wouldn't put it past the corrupt feds to pump the price for this.

A massive dump.

One time when I was mastering some music I figured I'd try out old fiver to have something to compare my work to. I spent $50 to get 10 songs "mastered" by "analog gear". And it was clearly just batch processed through a program without even listening. Every song had clipping and they all sounded like dogshit. Not that I was expecting much but it was more of a waste of $50 than I assumed it would be.

But he's still worse off than he would've been just holding his btc.

Remember when people posted this at 1200???

It's usually a better time to buy when the price is slumping, like 2 months ago.

Sure the concept of bitcoin works. That's why the blockchain is catching on. That doesn't mean bitcoin itself will be successful in terms of price/adoption.
