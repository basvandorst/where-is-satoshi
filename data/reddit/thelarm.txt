If you must use an online wallet, use Blockchain.info, not Coinbase.
Coinbase delays payments, and, utterly fucks up all sorts of automated software that issue a time constraint on paying (Due to either locking an item down to just you, or, due to price changes). Blockchain has none of these issues.

This isn't very scalable, for now it's great when you only have one person paying via BTC a year, but, what if you have a full restaurant all paying via BTC? Then you're screwed.

The daemon was used to provide bitcoin addresses to people who requested it, then listed on blocknotify= and walletnotify= to inform me (automatically) that they had paid, and, give them access to what they had paid for. All automatically. Lots of RPC calls. No crashes.

I'm not downloading the leak just to check this, but, how many people deposited 300 bitcoins that day? You seem to imply quite a few, with:-

If you're this scared, buy a cheap phone for $2 off ebay, then, utilize a computer/friend elsewhere (I'd probably go with computer, for reliability, speed, and, trust) and just text the BTC address given to you plus a PSK to the phone number of a PAYG SIM.
Max physically stolen from you? $2 phone.
Only way to get the BTC would be also know the PSK, which, hopefully you don't tell the thief, because, why would you?

So what, it's impossible for me to photocopy a note? My printer doesn't require drivers for that (it has a touchscreen thingy), if I went and tried to copy a note, it'd tell me I wasn't allowed?
EDIT:- I managed to scan my notes perfectly fine, on the highest quality. I can physically see the yellow dots that are obviously the EUR, but, my scanner didn't pick it up. Yay?
At the same time, my printer is a network one, so, I probably am on some list now.

Thanks for the answers, looking forward to grabbing one myself to have a bit of a play-around with it. Hopefully the UK will be one of the day one release countries (We're big enough now-er-days, right?).


Sorry, I wrote that first and thought I was only going to ask one or two questions, but, my brain kept generating more questions.

Fair enough, I didn't absolutely wreck the thing, but, it was in relatively active use without crashing.

4GB of ram for bitcoin-daemon? What? I ran that shit off a 500MB server running Arch, it was a pain during the sync (Kept crashing every few thousand blocks), but, once it was up-to-date, it was perfectly fine, lasted months without a crash.
EDIT:- For anyone wondering:-
In your systemd .service file, it means you don't have to deal with the crashing.

Because it's the *standard*, that's why. If everyone jumped around not following standards it'd be impossible for computers to parse data.
Your *invalid* text reads:-
The *correct* standard reads:-
Although, `bitcoin://` is used on the web a bit more (Most browsers only accept `protocol://`, for instance, `
It tells barcode readers that aren't dedicated to bitcoin that it's a bitcoin related application (and thus can ask the operating system to give the information to a bitcoin related application).
EDIT:- even blockchain.info's 'request payment' on an [address page]( uses [bitcoin://](

Four character password? Any proof of that? Why is it so hard to crack? I've not been keeping up with Bitcoin recently.
I assume just a really high requirement for testing a password? Like one second+ for an average computer? Or what?

What happens if the miner uses a new address for each block? Resulting in it being impossible to detect using that, relatively simplistic, method?

Interesting. UK is basically non-existent. What more, when you touch down at the airport, there's normally vending machines that dispense SIM cards with credit, fully activated for about 2.5GBP more than the credit on them is worth (For a profit by the person who put up the vending machine). The second you slip it into your phone, it texts you your new number, and, bamb, activated. You don't have to verify anything.
Pretty sure the US and Egypt is like this too, although I've never used it, I've seen the SIM vending machines there too.

It really depends where you want the anonymity. If you care that the government knows you now own X many bitcoins, then, yes, this is good anonymity. If you care that the government knows you now own ***these*** X many bitcoins, then, I'd probably just exchange my BTC for BTC online, you'd get a better rate at a lot less hassle.

Couple of questions:-
1. What happens to people under the normal age for credit cards? In many countries, you're required to be eighteen, or have the authorization of a guardian (In which case, the card is in their name basically)
2. How much personal information do I have to give away to acquire one of these cards? I understand merchants leak quite a bit of info in of themselves (Location, names, payment amounts, etc...), but, if I just want to grab one of these cards, how much info do I have to give?
3. What's the price of one of these cards going to be? Many issuers issue cards for free now-er-days, as, my understanding is they're relatively cheap to create, depending on the quality of the print job (~$2 or less per card)
4. Will they have RFID capabilities to use in places where there are no swiping/inserting capabilities (Example of one of those would be public transport in London, we have "Oyster Cards" which are pre-topped up cards with money, but, we can also use our CC on the same terminals as the Oyster Card and it just charges the CC instead)
5. What do we do if a vendor has an *insanely* slow timeout? Maybe a second or half of one?
6. Will we have the ability to use it in any country we wish? For instance, if I have my CC issued in the UK, then go over to France or Germany, my normal CC will still work (Although, I normally have to call my bank to authorize it), is it the same with these cards?
7. My understanding of the credit card protocol (Which, is insanely low) is that even at vendors it utilizes the sixteen digit number on the front, under that logic, will we be able to utilize this card for online purchases where BTC isn't an option, such as Amazon?
8. Follow up question to question 7, what stops minors from utilizing this card as verification that they're over eighteen on sites (For instance, pornographic sites, PayPal, etc...)? 
9. Are these cards "Updatable"? Considering all the logic behind them will be at greenaddress.it's HQ (or, really, their data center), does this mean that you can apply updates to the logic of the card without requiring to issue new cards?
10. Will we be able to issue monthly subscriptions through this? Imagine I use service "ABC" and I agree to pay them $30/month, can I tell greenaddress.it that I authorize "ABC" to take $30/month out of my card (Assuming I presign my BTC transactions, of course) without requiring my phone?
11. What happens if I'm utilizing a service that doesn't charge directly, and, charges when the order is processed (For instance, multiple services that physically ship items to you won't charge your CC until the product is in stock)? In this case, I'm going to have to be manning my phone 24/7 for a popup.
12. Will be be able to specify what BTC TXIDs are used to pay?
13. Where does our BTC terminate? Who is the person that converts it from BTC to fiat? You (Greenaddress.it)? The CC issuer (Mastercard, Visa, etc...)? Someone else? Multiple people?
14. If our phone doesn't have data, what occurs? Will it fallback to SMS?
15. If our phone doesn't have single, what occurs? Is there anyway to keep some money on our card (Like $20) which we can overrule the 2FA if we type a certain pin (I.E. 4832 for "Unlimited" money with 2FA, or, "2830" for $20 without 2FA)?
16. How will this work with taxes/what not?
17. As us BTC users are relatively paranoid, will we be able to *fully* (I.E. irreversibly) disable a CC instantly?
18. Following up to the last question, can we bulk order ten or twenty cards, then have them automatically expire at the end of each month?
Thanks, extremely interested in this. Sorry for the *really* long question sheet, but, I want to know exactly how some of this stuff works, and, I hope I sprung some questions on you you haven't thought of yet (So you can fix it before release!).

Credit Cards are easy, you swipe/insert them, type the pin, withdraw, receipt comes out, done. Bitcoins require the member of staff to go onto a blockexplorer, attempt to calculate what transaction is what, if they can't work it out, have to ask the user, etc...
One address per transaction is much easier (Does said address own more than X many coins?), more private and more scalable. It'd make no different to the customer, but, for the restaurant, that method would waste a lot of time that could be utilized serving other customers.

Registered with a fake name? What?
No idea about you, but, in the UK, you can walk into a shop, and, top up £10 or so, and, they give you the SIM with the £10 on it, they don't ask your name and you can pay cash. No need for a fake name.
Oh, and, P.S., I have my subscription based phone under a fake name.
