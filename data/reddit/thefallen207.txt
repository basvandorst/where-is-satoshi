This is a longshot but here we go. 
There is a woman who goes to my church and also lives in my neighborhood. Her husband died years and years ago and she has a degenerative spine issue that has caused her to be out of work. She just told us that her car was about to get repossessed (or it already has been by now I assume). She is having issues paying for her house, food, and living expenses and her income has been less than $5k this whole year. She has a garage sale almost every Sat and she makes things to try and sell there. I would love to help her out myself, but already "adopted" a couple from the church and have been helping them out financially. If you would like to speak to me about helping her please get in touch. Thank you.
