Thanks for putting this together, I do believe our system in the US is amazing and transparent and feel quite lucky to live here. I didn't not mean to cast yellen in a negative light I think she has done an amazing job in her time as chair and I am sad to see her leave. The rest of the world does not have the amazing team looking out for them like we do though and I think crypto will put pressure on dictators and their federal reserves and force them to do a better job for their people or people will use another currency. Also idk if 10% inflation in the 70s was keeping my dollar that stable ;)
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:59:59
You see we’ve created over a hundred billion dollars out of thin air. We are lobbying hard I assure you. We promise Congress a few bitcoins in their secret bitcoin account and they accept bitcoin and wave it through with their magic wand. You see our government is corruptible and bitcoin is too but at least bitcoin is transparent as the code is available to all. I can corrupt your politician and you will never know but if you corrupt my bitcoin code I shall know. We have the upper hand.

Thanks. I was rewatching the scene, it’s my favorite so far in the series, and just got inspired. So many of the lines I didn’t even need to change.

I could quote the other extreme to make your point of view sound ridiculous as well: why would I save money for dinner in a time of hyper-inflation when I can just buy a bigger lunch now? I assure you I get great enjoyment out of my house and car so I will not be going without those just to watch my net worth increase. Inflation causes intermittent monetary crises due to periods of insane growth that a free market, fed not printing money, would not sustain. Technology and efficiency gains still count in deflationary times don't act like all would fall apart.

The possibility of offchain improvements is significant but an improvement in transaction throughput is hardly irrelevant. Going from 250k transaction per day to 1 million would aid our growing pains.

I plan on using it as a store of value not to transact. About $100 of Gold’s $1300 price tag can be attributed to usage in jewelry or electronics. The rest of the value is not intrinsic and is based solely on trust that someone else thinks it’s worth it. It’s actually better than gold for me because it’s lighter, and I know the fixed supply. Gold’s supply could change due to technology. Don’t you think the ability to send a billion dollars for a dollar without permission to anyone in the world is worth something? This is the only asset ever that cannot be seized, I keep my key in my head. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:28:44
I don’t believe in intrinsic value. Keep in mind intrinsic value is transitory. Centuries ago oil was worthless as their was no engines to burn it in. The first secure anonymous and permission less system for value transmission surely has some value. Is it a pump and dump sure, but there’s some value there. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:11:16
It is good if you want economic policy that benefits lenders and savers as opposed to the current one that benefits spenders and debtors. I am the former so I support deflationary monetary policy, idc if it slows down growth some, it will be healthier growth actually worth the financing.
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:17:07
Private entity or not I don't like Mrs. Yellen having unilateral control over my money. The reason I like crypto is because I have freedom of choice to move my value to the monetary system I agree with. In the world right now your monetary system is decided by your geographic location the most insidious monopoly in existence. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:06:54
Yeah exactly and I wouldn’t have supported those devaluations. Our monetary policy hurts savers because our policy is inflationary. I am a saver as are the majority of poor people, keep money in savings account not stocks, and we are tired of not earning shit because of central bank policy. We are choosing the invest in a deflationary policy. Shall be interesting to see who wins. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:21:40
Money must still be lent it will be much more expensive that it is now. So at the moment I lose 2% a year due to inflation for doing nothing, so I will loan out at 1%, to lose less money. But if bitcoin were king and I was gaining 5% a year in purchasing power I would not loan out except for 6% interest. What this means is that your entrepreneurial endeavor that needs financing needs to be 6 times as compelling to be rewarded with financing, I think a lot of shit projects get funding today that don't deserve it. The people who are punished by this are savers.

It is speculative but I trust the coders that improve the protocol more than I trust any government or central bank of any country outside North America and Europe. Governments have a long history of sucking at managing monetary policy. When rich people get together and set their standards they do what they need to to benefit themselves. I trust the minds and the incentives behind bitcoin more than anything else. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:44:28
I don’t think your analogy is just. I think it’s more similar to everyone chooses a hole to bury their money in. I’m stumbling through the worlds largest surface area of possible holes and I happen to pick theirs. Idk whose it is or if anything if anything is even in their. I think legal ownership of coins on a Blockchain is going to be more complicated than we think. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:25:16
You are not correct. I can name many countries, Russia venezuela Germany Argentina,  whose currencies have depreciated by 90-99% while their productivity stayed the same or decreased slightly. This is due to a fault of leadership printing way too much money. Bitcoin and fiat are backed by the same thing faith in the system that mints the currency. As I said I simply trust their leadership more as they don’t have to run for re election in s few years and are intelligent to be in bitcoins inner circle. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:46:16
both systems "work" one just may work better than the other, if only we could run controlled experiments in economics. In a deflationary system there will not be acute economic crises that cause my stocks to drop 50% in a year, but sadly their won't be steady years of 10-15% growth either :(
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:02:23
The government has the same amount of ability to shut down bitcoin as it does to shut down bit torrent. When you have a peer to peer system you have to jail or kill all participants to make it stop, around 5 million people. The government cannot stop bitcoin like it can’t stop Pirate Bay. I hope they do hate bitcoin and feel powerless to stop it, as opposed to them accepting it. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:10:02
We reverse economic crises by printing money which is not a victimless endeavor my good sir. Each system has tradeoffs and I agree deflation is not a good way to run the world economy. But I will be keeping my funds in a deflationary asset, stocks and bitcoin, while others keep their in cash and lose purchasing power so I can take advantage of the great economic benefits of an inflationary system. The reason the poor get poorer is because they put their meager savings in a worthless savings account and not stocks, inflationary monetary policy hurts the poor.

Satoshi gave a great gift to the Japanese central bank. A viable out for unsustainable fiat money printing, Japan needs this most due to debt levels and demographics not conducive to inflation that would help devalue that debt.

It’s a concern but right now garbage projects are getting funded that wouldn’t be if interest rates weren’t so low. In a deflationary world your project would have to have a more compelling return for you to risk taking out a bitcoin loan. We will grow slower but more steadily, smaller financial crises.

Thank you this is a reasonable answer. I fear for the long term security if our network of miners decide they can’t profit anymore. Still thought when block reward is sub 1 BTC and lighting network has fees near zero it will be tough to be profitable paying any electricity. But I guess if BTC is a few hundred thousand it will be fine.

I agree there is no direct motive as there was no typical sketchy phishy link in the email is was as professional as possible. It seems extremely unlikely that the primary motive is to affect the price of markets. If so it could be incredibly bullish if you view this as a conspiracy. The next question is how much further do we have to fall from a quite sophisticated and coordinated manner of manipulation such as this. I have buy orders down to 1k. This is hopefully a positive long term sign.

How so? 12 central bankers having control of my money that I don’t consent to is not the same as me signaling with my node that I agree to a little inflation to keep my transactions secure.

I see, This is the reality and likely due to market forces. But sending 1BTC now and 1 BTC in the future when worth a lot more  (assuming it is) should require the same fee assuming the network is just as busy correct?
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:20:33
In 3 years you think half of all BTC will be lost or simply won't be circulated? I do think about 1 million coins were lost early on when they were worth pennies but now that they are extremely valuable they won't be so easily misplaced. You see I have a few BTC that I am keeping out of circulation but if the price goes up enough I can assure they I will be circulating them.
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:58:42
Let's just reduce the blocksize to zero. If there are no transactions everyone can run a node on their POS computer. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 13:44:42
True I’m thinking past 2032. My fear is how sustainable our model is and am only saying we may have to tweak to provide additional block rewards later on if we do fear for the network. Agility is a strength not a weakness.

Wow this is a really great resource thanks. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:58:41
Mining could need subsidizing by 2024. If the lighting net work does indeed make transactions free I would fear a drop in hashrate and the network won’t be as secure. What will likely happen is we will have to update the protocol to keep inflation at a steady 1%. I honestly prefer no coin cap and low inflation to paying any transaction fee. But time will tell. People think 21 million coins is set in stone but it’s not. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 21:16:46
I mean it is a matter of creating a solution, just may be and is incredibly difficult. The main point of my post was to point out to people that what the average user hates (fees) is the smallest percent income of the miners so it seems like we should be able to work this out. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 21:46:05
I'm sure I can just find this online but am having a little difficulty. How large can a block be with 100% segwit transactions?

The only thing keeping bitcoin safe is a lot of hash power. I won’t be convinced bitcoin is safe until the total cost of miners for a 51% attack is greater than the $4 trillion that is the US fiscal budget. Until then we must grow or we will be attacked and could die.

One of my favorite notions about intrinsic value is how time dependent it is. A thousand years ago oil had no value. A hundred years ago natural gas had no value and they would just bleed it into the atmosphere to get to the oil. Intrinsic value is transitory. Gold has held on pretty long tho.
