the oldest exchange in Canada(Quadriga) is filling for bankruptcy, citing they lost access to their cold wallet as their CEO died last month.   
Can his ghost move the coins to another wallet in 5 years time without anyone noticing it. In other words can his ghost log-in, change the wallet address and move the funds to another wallet? And in general if the court can reveal the wallet's address is there a way to keep eyes on it?
