The small blockists who controls this forum are attempting to hide the fact that the most upvoted comments are in favor of increasing the block size.
@_date: 2015-12-29 19:33:04
Bitcoin core: no compromise at all on block size, conflict of interest, drama queens, deadlocked decision making process, hiring of core devs by profit-seeking investors. It's time to remove this team from it's power as central decision makers for the future of the protocol.
@_date: 2015-06-27 03:11:35
It's good to know that you and Jeff are collaborating. This may be the start of some core dev consensus. I am not in price panic mode. The panic comes more from the observation that the block size debates seems to be going in circles. I am invested in you guys, and like many other investors I am watching the discussion hoping for progress to be made before users are impacted. I am reading all the e-mails from the dev dist list and it seems that any block increase proposal is met with criticism. I want to see you guys work with open minds to converge to any scaling solution with constructive criticism and collaboration.
To that end, here are some of my observations.
I'd like you to consider that many nodes are ready for more action. My ISP recently increased my connection speed and lowered my monthly fee without me asking them to do that. Look where we come from before falling into the centralization fear. My node is one of 6000 and each could serve dozens of spv clients which are connected only for short amount of time. So to me the node count FUD is resolved. 
Establishing a scalability roadmap is important for 'marketing'. 
Finally, the whole fee market discussion is the part that mostly seems to be made to favor Blockstream. Bitcoin does not need fees now. Bitcoin transactions must remain as low as possible to build up critical mass. Fee market now means we will lose a very important argument to bring in new users. It's already enough trouble to convert from dollars, don't hit them with fees over that. We have the block reward now. When we have huge blocks with thousands of transactions, we can have a small tx fee that remains competitive compared to the legacy transaction processors, yet would add up to significant amount for miners.
@_date: 2015-12-22 16:22:43
My understanding is that Matt's fast relay network allows for a found block to be relayed by sending a very small amount of bytes basically containing the nonce and a transaction hash list which is very compact. Perhaps the great firewall does not only slow down data rates, but adds significant latency impacting even small packets? I can't believe there isn't a way to circumvent it with all the wireless tech we have around.

The conditions you need are a working version of sidechains, and you need bitcoin transaction fees to be high enough so people will have incentive to go through the extra steps to convert their bitcoins into your alt-sidechain-coins. This is why no blockstream dev has come up with a BIP and roadmap to scale. You are trying to buy time, and congratulations on that because I am amazed how far you have come against the majorit of users, companies and miners.
We've seen enough FUD like Adam's algorithmic evaluation of scaling, centralization fear, non consensus hard fork, and all kinds of words that sound scary to the general public.
If I see bitcoin adoption, tx rate and price going up I won't care if I have to pay a bit more to maintain my node. My ISP is cheap, unlimited bandwidth, for me this is a solved problem. The most important asset the Bitcoin experiment needs is users, lots of users. It really does not make any sense to forcefully slow down adoption with some Robert Metcalfe like claims. The cost of bandwidth, storage and processing have been going down for years, so it really seems to me that the status quo is to scale and you should be the one having to work harder than Gavin to try and halt adoption like you are. 
Like it or not, apparent conflict of interrest is bad for Blockstream. You succeded in turning Blockstream into an evil corp even before you build your user base. Good luck with that. It's still time to do things right, you could either start helping us to scale, or simply ask all Blockstream team to stop being involved in the block size discussion.

Don't you think it's just a coincidence that no blockstream dev are in favor of increasing the blocksize? 
Having users coming to your product is one of the most difficult first steps companies need to achieve. It's very common that companies  get users by providing free services at first. It doesn't matter that Blockstream is open source, if they become relevant by forcing users into sidechains, it will indirectly generate contracts to their devs.
Even if there are no conflict of interest, the simple fact that there is an apparent conflict of interest should prevent blockstream devs from even taking place in the block size debate. 
I bought all my bitcoins after reading the bitcoin wiki scalability page. I believe the use case for switching between Bitcoin and sidechains will be too much for common users.  I'm sure other people also bought in because of the potential displayed on the scalability page whose numbers have been there for years. I believe having no clear scaling plan will turn off investors and impact future investments, adoption and value of Bitcoin.
The Bitcoin Blockstream devs want is not the one i bought.
@_date: 2015-06-23 13:50:48
Yes, in my opinion. High risk, high reward.
@_date: 2015-06-04 15:27:41
Interesting result. It's not the first poll that shows a majority of votes for larger blocks. Gavin and Mike please release a version supporting larger block, this is where we're going. The core devs who don't want it can just remain on their altcoin and debate endlessly if they should reduce block size to 100kb. We need to be done with this already.
@_date: 2015-06-04 20:27:21
When connected to multiple peers my node won't upload new blocks to all because most of them will get the new block from other nodes. So your calculation with 8 nodes is flawed. 
Another thing, my ISP this week upgraded my connection to 10 up/30 down (from 2 up / 20 down) and lowered my monthly fee by 5$ all this with unlimited usage. Increasing block size is no problem for my node.
@_date: 2015-06-17 02:13:45
Don't forget all the 'IP over avian' nodes, we can't afford to exclude them you know for decentralization.
@_date: 2015-06-12 12:55:07
This suggestion is good, however, how long are we from getting this implemented in a decentralized trustless manner and usable across all wallets in a transparent way for the users? Since there's a lot of work to do, why not make a compromise and bump the hard limit just a little while other alternative are implemented? 
There is an apparent conflict of interest, it seems Blockstream developers are trying to buy time. I'm sure you are all well intended, but even that being perceived could make Blockstream look evil.  Why not just agree with Gavin, Blockstream would avoid this apparent conflict of interest, Bitcoin would avoid the congestion and bad press it will generate. Seems like a win-win?

Not at all. My point is about Bitcoin going where the majority wants it to go. It doesn't matter which core dev is behind the code, what matters is that a minority of actors shouldn't be able to force their views on a majority who wants something else.
@_date: 2015-06-28 10:58:41
Yet the core devs against block size increase are ignoring the polls showing that the majority of users want it to happen.
@_date: 2015-06-26 18:53:52
Keep in mind, while reading this, that Pieter Wuille is part of Blockstream, and therefore has financial interest in slowing down the blocksize increase for his company to get more business. It's so saddening that many core dev team members became corrupt and are in a position to prevent what the majority wants.

When you are mining you are actively trying to create a valid transaction block in which the first transaction is a deposit of 25 bitcoins to yourself, i.e. to the bitcoin address for which you own the private key. When you mine in a mining pool the pool operator redistributes that reward to all contributors. There is no need to have 25 transactions for 25 bitcoins because one transaction can be made with inputs and outputs containing multiple bitcoins or even tiny fractions of a bitcoin.
You cannot create 25 bitcoins without resolving the proof-of-work. Finding a valid nonce is very hard, and if you don't have the correct nonce in your block and try to send it to other nodes, your block will not propagate to the rest of the network and your attempt to claim the reward will simply fail.
@_date: 2014-03-06 15:17:46
The number of possible addresses is astronomical. You could be generating millions of addresses per second for decades and it remains extremely unlikely that you would find one with coins.

One thing that was discussed by developers is the possibility to relay blocks as a list of transaction hashes, effectively reducing block size by a factor of 10 or more. Thus, each node could rebuild the block with transaction references instead of receiving the same transactions a second time with the block. This could improve block propagation times if it can be coded so that rebuilding a block from transaction references isn't slower than transmitting it. It would also reduce bandwidth requirements by almost a half. Faster block propagation means less incentive for mining pools to produce smaller blocks.

Interresting, I would like understand. Can you explain me a scenario where 75% of the miners have upgraded to 2mb which result in a wallet to lose money? Why wouldn't my wallet see it's related transactions in the longest 2mb chain? Aren't the SPV calls independent of the block size? 
@_date: 2016-01-16 12:28:14

@_date: 2016-01-22 21:27:53
I believe a hard fork would be faster. If the core dev would push for 2mb hard fork, if we send the upgrade notification with the alert key, a significant portion of full nodes would upgrade. Many miners want 2 mb but would rather have the core team on board. 
AFAIK all wallets are connecting to lots of peers and they use the longest chain so even if some percentage of nodes don't upgrade it wouldn't impact much. I'd like to see rational arguments about why a hard fork is so dangerous, compared to segwit  which needs everybody to change code to support it. Yes this change can be done gradually, but this could be adopted too slowly and make the transaction demand hit hard on the capacity wall.

No. If there are 6000 nodes on the network, we do not have to relay 6000 * 8 * 1 megabyte. Some nodes will transmit the block more, some other nodes less, but on average each node needs to transmit a new block just once. Once 6000 * 1 megabyte has been transmitted, every node has the new block.

I was so happy when Adam Back came up with the 2-4-8 proposal. Now, SegWit's hundreds of lines of consensus codes of changes makes me nervous. 
I do think Peter is a genius and appreciate his work, but Segwit is the most ambitious change in Bitcoin's history. So from my perception a hard fork to 2 mb is less risky, since it can enable us to use an extra year to test SegWit. We can then continue to welcome new users with no transaction delays, and get a clean and confidently tested segwit deployment.
I am a classic supporter and I accept your downvotes. We all have the same goal of Bitcoin succeeding and fully respect anyone who's siding with core. However, my personal opinion is that being able to welcome new users and service transactions quickly is more important than the order of our scaling plan priorities.
I'm on board no matter what ends up being decided. Thanks to all the developers who are fighting through this toxic debate. Having the debate and the arguments can only result in a better Bitcoin.

For 1) we just agreed that SPV wallets won't need to upgrade. Full nodes will get the message from the alert key stating that they need to upgrade. If they accept money then they would have been warned. Moreover only coins generated from the new blocks on the minority chain would be invalid and not also transmitted on the new chain right?
For 2) it seems unlikely that after 75% of miner support and 4 weeks of activation notice, miners would revert. 
I am still not convinced that the risk is significant, but thanks for sharing your point of view!
@_date: 2016-01-22 21:55:41
Ok, I read this, but it seems I am missing something. I still don't see how can a wallet create a public key for which it doesn't have the private key that would result in lost funds. Can anybody point out one SPV wallet software that wouldn't follow the longest 2mb chain?

Bitcoin's been here a long time with great track record compared to other cryptos, and the price can continue to rise when people are getting onboard faster than the miners are selling to pay their electricity bills. 
However hashrate cannot continue to rise forever because its cost is absorbed by the users indirectly. Higher hash rate means higher fees and higher inflation. 
Over time the efficiency of different crypto currencies will come to matter because it impacts how well it can be a store of value. People can choose how much they are willing to pay for different security levels.

Blockstream hired many core devs. Their plan to scale is to force users into using LN.  In order to incentivize users into it LN they need a fee market in bitcoin so LN txs are cheaper compared to BTC txs. Even if LN software isn't proven to work, they are trying as hard as possible to delay blocksize increase to make LN relevant even if this mean making normal BTC users hit capacity causing BTC tx delays and unreliability. Thus they want to risk impacting BTC adoption to make their project a success.

I can't see the relationship between block size and number of mining pools. The number of mining pools seems to me a better decentralization metric than the number of non mining nodes.

Perhaps members of the Bitcoin community or the Bitcoin Foundation should write the regulations themselves and propose them to governments in an attempt to do some preventive damage control. We need regulations to protect the public, not the bankers. The current regulations are meant to protect big bank's monopoly on money by preventing smaller innovations and startups from growing and taking even a small part of the big bank's profit. For example, think about BitInstant who spent so much money to get compliance in every state, and after that they're still facing issues getting on board with a bank account. I think James is right when he says that unsatisfactory regulations will result in businesses moving elsewhere without impacting Bitcoin's value in the long term.

Large mining pool operators have the power to raise the minimum transaction fees because they select which transactions to include in a block. If they do, they could get more miners in their pool because they become more profitable for them. They also have an incentive to create smaller blocks to increase propagation speed of a new found block and to lower the risk of an orphan block. So with that in mind, my question is: as Bitcoin's TPS ramps up, will centralization of mining power happen and will the fees increase a lot ?

Yes. Using her own reasoning, fiat money is even easier to replicate: you can just photoshop something and color print it, no compiler required!

Max Keiser knows a lot about finance, not only about Bitcoin. I strongly recommend watching his Keiser Report. Even watching episodes not directly talking about Bitcoin will make you understand how Bitcoin is better than everything else in finance. Max spends a lot of time documenting how corruption and abuse is happening every week in the... what I would now call "legacy" financial system.

In the winter, mining hardware will perform a percentage of the heat output usually done by your furnace. So weather conditions are actually part of the profitability equation.

The way I see it is we have started an irreversible revolution in finance that may well result in a fairer distribution of wealth than what the legacy financial system can do.

This would be an example of over-regulation that would cause BTC business activity to move away. Many would buy from companies in other countries not implementing this requirement, and receive the product through international delivery.

On my screen, a 100$ increase is about 3 cm long. 
Distance between my screen and the moon is 384,400 km, therefore,  when this charts reaches the moon, each BTC will be worth 1280 billion dollars.

Viewed from this angle, we should request a tax refund for capital loss whenever any savings in $USD loses value relative to BTC due to excessive QE!

My opinion: brain wallet is too risky, I wouldn't trust my own human limitations. Use bitaddress.org from a disconnected computer, print the paper wallets to PDF and send funds into them. 7ZIP this PDF with AES encryption with a complex &amp; long password you can't forget, make 5 copies on usb keys and burned CDs hidden in your home's walls and ceiling and give copies to family members.

Time for a classic fact:
Every 10 minutes, 25 Bitcoins are issued, worth about $11,000. In the same interval, the FED prints $20 million dollars with quantitative easing.
QE is a very good thing for us. More QE means BTC increases relative to USD. More QE means more people fleeing USD for BTC. Federal Reserve you have my approval: print more!!

This is the best and most informative Bitcoin impact analysis I've seen so far. Stefan brings some solid arguments about how important this revolution is. I was already very bullish toward Bitcoin but this video convinced me to significantly increase the % of my BTC holdings in my portfolio.

The Global Bitcoin Authority is issuing a warning to consumers on fiat currencies:
- Governments could devalue your holdings at anytime with QE and excessive money printing. 
- Banks may gamble with your money, lend it to people or companies who will not repay, create toxic financial products, participate in drug cartels and pay fines with it. 
- Fiat currencies have a long history of being used in criminal activities, such as buying drugs and money laundering.
Should you decide to own some fiat currencies, be fully aware that you and only you will be responsible for all the risks taken by those banks who will one day collapse and either bail-out (massive inflation devaluing all money) or bail-in (seize your money).  
What can you do to protect yourself:
- Make sure you fully understand the risks of fiat currencies
- Do not keep a large amount of fiat in a bank for an extended period of time

Yes, we are. Many BTC owners don't fully understand its potential and inner workings thus whenever they misinterpret some news they panic sell. This is a sale (cheap BTCs!) and it won't last like previous temporary dips.

Yes they are. From  A configuration in which the vast majority of users sync lightweight clients to more powerful backbone nodes is capable of scaling to millions of users and tens of thousands of transactions per second.

I do get into the trouble of changing credit card every time I find a card that offers a higher reward percentage, even if it is only 0.25% more. I guess I'm not alone. 
So even if the retailer offers a small discount on BTC payments proportional to the bank and credit card fees, this could be enough for many to switch to BTC.

According to this  (from 2011) circulation is 3.376 M so yes this is a great advertisement.

This is huge! This is opening up a very large group of people to have portable bitcoins on their iPhone. Since 2011 more than 300 millions iPhones were sold, and that's not even counting the other ios products.  
Is it just me or enabling 2FA makes it impossible to sign-in this app?

I am already looking forward the feeling of victory that will start spreading around when bitcoin's price resume its inevitable rise even after the bank's and gov's attempts to prevent it from succeeding. Perhaps at some point, all the bans and regulation attempts will start sounding like background noise.
