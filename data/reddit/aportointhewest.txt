Don't buy from shitty exchanges like Coinbase, who do not update their wallets to the latest bitcoin protocol: segwit.
Use a Segwit enabled exchange. 
This is not a bitcoin problem. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 06:45:39
It's not about transaction fee. Stop being a fucking bonehead mate. 
When I need money today, I need to work for someone richer - who can borrow from a bank at near zero percent interest rates. This imples that by the time that money trickles down to me, it has lost its value. 
You can't create more than 21M bitcoin, so i never lose value by hodling bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 10:57:22
Activating segwit would mean more users will be able to withdraw bitcoin (especially those holding &lt;$100), without paying high fee. 
They are not allowing that the most rational reason is that they are possibly insolvent and possibly don't have your bitcoin with them. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 16:09:15
Will users be able to receive bitcoin from a LN channel, if they don't have any bitcoin?
I am asking this because LN must make it easy to receive a small amount of bitcoin without massive fee. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 06:14:00
Then I have to pay extra in fee, for any future transactions from that wallet. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 18:04:43
Thanks - that clarifies it. I was asking a question out of curiosity, I am not a baiter. I understand LN will have limitations, and so will other L2 solutions. 
I believe some LN channels would be free to open, if you are only receiving payments? The real downside then is, it could be difficult to move what you have received, to an onchain transaction because of the fee market and you have only managed to accumulate a small amount? As long as you are within the channel, it should be fine (again, not ideal - but i do see it as a solution)
 
@_date: 2018-01-12 06:41:34
I obviously know how to move it. But it is annoying as a customer, and coinjar being a major exchange should upgrade their software. This is what the rant is about
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:40:55
Yes, there will be a bumpy ride and markets can be manipulated in infinite ways. Keep in mind though, that traders have always managed to somehow influence supply of other commodities. Bitcoin is different. If you want a different rate of supply, wait till the next halvening - even then, you can only have it go one way. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:06:01
I just started a startup, I have so much to do - and fuck, this keeps me up. I don't even want to see price, but i can't :(
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:28:56
Not surprised. I have a small startup - kind of an airbnb for short courses of any kind (  We just launched in Australia, and all our cryptocurrency courses are always sold out. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:13:26
the most likely scenario. I have no idea how people believe in weird conspiracy theories. 
If wallstreet could act on consensus and mass short everything (or match trade) all the time forever, we would not need bitcoin to solve the byzantine general problem.  
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:48:32
This. 
Hodler here. You did well mate. Now start averaging up again ;) 
@_date: 2017-11-08 12:54:39
Remember the most important rule:
It's not your bitcoin if you don't have your private key. 
Learn about wallets, paper wallets, and how to keep your coins safe. Do not keep your coins with coinbase or another exchange. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:15:02
If Elon accepts btc, he gets to Hodl BTC. Tesla is in trouble. BTC gains can get him out of it, in a year ;) 
@_date: 2017-11-15 10:44:14
Apologies if you are not a paid shill. Too many of them around though. 
But yes, just because a transaction has a fee, doesn't mean it will get processed. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:17:14
monero blocks have &lt;10 transactions each. It's actually way less private than the kind of privacy you can get out of bitcoin, if you know what you are doing. If you dont know what you are doing, nothing can get you privacy. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 10:21:48
No. Your coin isn't all that private. 
There are monero blocks with a single fucking transaction. As a law enforcer, I will first be attracted towards monero (not bitcoin ,which people use for legit purposes as well). All I have to do is find which user was doing a monero transaction when a block with 1 transaction was being mined. That ring won't of much use. 
Yes you can use monero over tor to prevent this - but then, your coin is as private as bitcoin (where at least the user has a few thousand coins to hide into)
Let's not forget that in most cases, you need bitcoin to buy xmr. Very few exchanges will do xmr to fiat.  
@_date: 2017-11-18 05:21:11
And people who will lose their bitcoin, because they kept them with shady exchanges, will learn never to do it again - pushing btc price further up, in the long run. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 08:17:19
Great decision. I am okay to watch out the fork, but exchanges and consumer-facing companies should not side with a fork which doesn't have replay protection 
@_date: 2017-11-08 12:51:15
It might be more viable because spammers will stop spamming the mempool. 
Also, price doesn't determine viability of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 11:59:52
No. It is being used right now as viable money. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 10:56:47
Yes, but satoshi won't hardfork to give them their money back. If you don't get why this is important, you do not understand crypto at all.

@_date: 2017-11-15 11:08:53


lol. If you don't have tor, your ISP knows if you are using monero or not. It's not me who doesn't know what they are talking about. 
You seem to be a paid shill from XMR's marketing department, who is parroting lines. 


We will talk once kovri arrives. Till then XMR isn't foolproof either. 


On most exchanges, you can't.


No you can. Because there are monero blocks with a single fucking transaction - this is because no one uses this shitcoin. As a cop, all I need to know is who was connecting to a monero node - and if a block has a single transaction, i am pretty sure that's formidable proof without any plausible deniability. 
Hey jonny - you connected to a monero node at 7:30pm, and the next two blocks had just 1 transaction. Why are you using monero? - you don't see the problem with low transactions? 
@_date: 2017-11-22 09:41:28
Small ISPs serve a few but they serve the full internet. I have seen such operators across Asia, and most of them offer better speeds and less restrictions than big telcos
@_date: 2017-11-15 10:04:52
Lol, no. 
Bitcoin is not run by a central authority like Ver, Jihan or Vitalik. If no one wants to confirm your transaction because of low fee, it might never get confirmed.
This is how bitcoin works. Don't like it? Feel free to buy the scam pump and dump coin from the other sub.
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:43:07
If you want to call it an investment, then so be it. However, it is better than hodling fiat. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:11:52
The biggest regrets are by those who sold after mt gox. I am one of those idiots. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 16:23:03
You are correct. The graph shows how much your investment would be worth today, if the person started investing a fixed dollar amount on that date. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 11:53:27
That's a very broad question. In what context? 
@_date: 2018-03-17 06:30:56
"One of the caches" will be lightning network. Bitcoin will have multiple L2's and a few will win over others. LN is a strong candidate. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 15:30:34
When the tide recedes, that's when you see who has their pants on. 
Bitcoin will be fine. Alts are about to get Rekt. 
Also, love the wet dog analogy. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:14:59
What you are saying is true. However, the global economy is on fire, and bitcoin will be one of the safest investments in the coming years. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 17:33:10
Lol. How? Bitcoin is p2p cash? Remember?  This is how we bought and sold back in the day, before shit like coinbase arrived. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 00:32:13
Yeah. Bitcoin is like [Captain America](
@_date: 2018-03-27 07:00:58
@_date: 2018-02-21 17:25:35
Yes. I create multiple Alts because of privacy concerns. 
All I can say is, that the transaction will happen in the most secure way, and only when both parties agree 100%
I will use a multi-sig wallet and a service like Monbux, so that there are no risks about one party running away. Happy to adopt other best practices. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 14:08:49
forget about it for 2-3 yearsat least, and hodl. It will be at at least 32k in 3 years. It could be 500k+ in 3 years as well. 
Bitcoin is way past the point where it can die. It has hundreds of thousands of rabid fans. 
Keep your btc secure in a hardware wallet, and educate yourself about the technology. You are very lucky to own 3. Most people will never own 0.1.

Who wants to collaborate on selling btc to Indians via Bisq? Setting up a store is easy - I am based outside India, and it's legal for me to sell bitcoin to or buy bitcoin from India. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 15:46:47
Use bisq.
