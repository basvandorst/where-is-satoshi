I stand corrected! thanks.
so sending coins through a few instawallets IS a reasonably secure way of anonymizing coins? it seems i can't even trace one of my own transactions back to the source

I don't think that's right. When you install the Bitcoin client you download the blockchain. This is the entire history of every transaction ever made in Bitcoin. Websites like blockchain.info analyse this blockchain and let you see what bitcoins moved where and when.
[example from blockchain.info frontpage](

Even if that trend line is to be believed, there's bound to be more crashes/dips on the road to $1,000+. Can't see $10,000 for another good few years.

Is the developer behind this active on this subreddit? Pasting a comment I posted on the blog entry:


Once they see they've been given $$$, they'll definitely want to learn more about bitcoin and how to get coins. Quoting the tip in BTC only risks users skipping over it or ignoring it/not understanding it.
EDIT: I'm not sure if it does already, but the bot should also message the recipient explaining what Bitcoin is, and how they can get started with their BTC. The bitcointip bot on reddit does this excellently with the [help] link, but I realise the twitter bot is limited to 140 characters.

The main effect the crash had on Silk Road, as far as I understand, was that vendors were cancelling orders that were made on April 10th before the crash. Orders which were made in BTC, and when the vendor got to check the order, the BTC value in $ was half of what it was when the order was made.
Vendors were then able to conveniently cancel the order, claiming they're temporarily out of stock or whatever, and wait for a re-order for more BTC.
I think there was a thread naming and shaming the guilty vendors on @_date: 2013-03-09 03:30:30
Usually when you send coins, MtGox will give you a transaction ID, you can look this up straight away on blockchain.info and see your transactions progress through the network, and how many confirmations it has. . Some sites require 6 confirmations before showing the coins have been received.

I think is a better place to get advice on how to buy bitcoins more anonymously than on MtGox.
Bearing in mind that MtGox have stated they will assist law enforcement as much as possible, it's up to you where to buy your bitcoins.
Standard advice seems to be that after you buy your coins wherever, send them through a few instawallets to tumble them a bit before going to SR.

What a cunt.
Thanks for posting that.

I've no interest in starting some argument over codecs here, but [here's a listening test]( done where AAC, Vorbis and even WMA come out ahead of MP3 (although this is only at 128k, MP3 may be more optimised for higher bitrates). [Here's one at 180k]( where Vorbis and MPC come out ahead of MP3. Those tests were eight years ago, and LAME/MP3 hasn't advanced since then as much as others have.
I'm not an expert, but from my understanding, a simple example of how other codecs are (technically, at least) better than mp3 is in how variable bitrate is implemented. (VBR is where lower bitrates are used for parts of a song which are quiet and don't need as much bitrate, so that higher bitrates can be used for more complex parts which need more data to encode them). 
Originally MP3 was constant bitrate only and every mp3 file had to be either 96, 128, 160, 192, 224, 256 or 320kbps (there are lower ones too). After VBR was tacked on afterwards, every frame still has to use one of those twelve-or-so bitrates, even if the optimum bitrate for a frame is somewhere in between those values (which it almost always will be). Other newer codecs don't have this restriction and use true VBR. Also, for encoding sections of complete silence in a VBR encoding, MP3 will use the lowest bitrate allowed by the standard, which is 32kbps. Newer codecs can encode digital silence at much closer to 0kbps I'd imagine.
But this is all off-topic, and MP3 V0 is still my preference anyway :)

I stand corrected. It looks identical to the mobile website.

Hope he takes his time writing and testing that tool. 
@_date: 2013-03-08 18:08:46
Trying this for the first time. I've two questions.
1. What are testnet and prodnet?
2. I don't want to have all my coins on my phone (big loss if I lose my phone or have to wipe and reflash a ROM for any reason). Can I email myself my encrypted wallet.dat with this?

Bitcoin has a great name which will be hard to replace, even if another cryptocurrency does have technical advantage. For many people on the street, digital currency and Bitcoin will be synonymous.
See mp3 for example, there are newer, more technically advanced codecs out there, but mp3 just got mainstream first, and for many average people on the street, digital music means mp3.

I think we're still in the awareness phase. Hardly anybody (in the general public) knows what bitcoin is yet.
@_date: 2013-03-15 02:41:12
Tipping Obama is more like a novelty, won't have any effect.
But the fact that people can tip others on Twitter with Bitcoin (and seemingly easily enough) is huge. This will increase awareness big time. 
@_date: 2013-04-22 07:22:11
No, but we'll be around when the number of new coins created per day becomes much lower than it is now.

With the differences in rates between the exchanges (sometimes as much as $10/BTC), what stops people from buying at a cheaper one, sending the coins to another exchange, and then sell for higher?
What would stop someone writing a bot to look across all exchanges and do this automatically?
@_date: 2013-02-22 13:14:35
Thanks for this! Had been very confused about those graphs, best explanation I've read!
@_date: 2013-03-07 05:35:19
It seems to be a wrapper for the website. You can get the same experience as the app by just going to coinbase.com in your Android browser. 
@_date: 2013-03-15 02:55:24
This is great.
I remember similar posts on the reddit front page five years ago (maybe more): "I saw someone in front of me in college on reddit!", and that did seem interesting at the time (of course seeing someone on reddit now is no big deal at all).
Hopefully in another five years, meeting other bitcoiners will just seem normal. This is the beginning! :)
