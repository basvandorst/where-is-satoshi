What does this have to do with bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-07-28 12:32:21
Where im from its no fee to withdraw cash, can even do it free in normal stores
@_date: 2019-07-30 07:20:33
Why would you earn more money if they pay in bitcoin? Just work OT and buy coins?

Should have put all company money into BTC when it was at 20k USD, problem solved right? Wait... 
@_date: 2018-10-28 17:43:55
Its funny that its compared to a currency (USD) everyone here seem to think will "die"
I wonder what people will compare BTC to if USD actually "dies"
Value unknown...

If fiat is worthless how can you buy bitcoin with it? 
@_date: 2019-08-06 15:54:48
250 trillion and 750 trillion dosent sound much diffrent to me, both insane numbers that u cant imagine
@_date: 2019-08-09 16:18:58
U realise that people made like 25$ per week too?
And damn "my dollar" that i earned 1919, ye im 100 years old
@_date: 2019-08-09 16:47:31
Pretty much, if u plan on living 100 years
@_date: 2019-04-03 11:15:22
Thought it was world currency, as far as i know price to buy dollars from my fiat is the same as before

Depends on where u live, 670GB is nothing in 6 weeks, thats like 0,28MB/s 24/7. (3Mbit)
Where i live i could cap out my line at 11 MB/s (100Mbit) 24/7 without anyone saying a word about it...

Not your keys not your coins
On that note, since banks cant be trusted we cant put keys there, i guess if they dont wanna learn then they will be poor, as if that would help tho...
Since would u trust your children with the codes?
Let alone the wife if she leaves u :x

If u think bitcoin is made for tax evasion then ur pretty stupid
@_date: 2019-01-20 12:51:15
Is this about the BTC vendors or? Cuz they do take quite a cut when u buy/sell coins
@_date: 2019-01-03 10:53:28
Avoiding taxes ? :) why would "cash" be better then credit cards?
@_date: 2019-01-20 09:41:43
Down? 
@_date: 2019-01-03 11:07:08
How do that work? Save all receipts you get from restaurants? 
@_date: 2018-12-30 16:47:15
Maybe u should look up volatile... Cuz bitcoin is just that 
@_date: 2018-12-31 10:33:58
