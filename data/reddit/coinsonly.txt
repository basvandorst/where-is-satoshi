No thanks.

Who is going to be doing hundreds or thousands of txs on one settlement?  If I want to buy something from someone.  I'm paying and closing the channel.  That's it.
@_date: 2018-01-20 12:08:36
So the answer is yes.  And my response is no thanks.  I'll back a currency that isn't trying to charge me multiple times for a single transaction.

Out of the candidates available in the final election I picked the far superior one.  No regrets.   Have a good one, yourself.
@_date: 2018-01-21 14:34:26
All that tells me is those particular people in LA are stupid.
@_date: 2018-01-20 04:12:05
I'm still getting charged for every transaction after opening a channel, correct?
@_date: 2018-01-20 14:38:09
Dem logic.  It's never very logical.
@_date: 2018-01-20 14:05:41
Single transaction.  Charged for opening a channel, charged for transaction, charged to close channel.  You seem to be confused.
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:34:56
I can afford it without issue.  I just chose not to waste my money on foolish things.

He very rarely responded to them.   It was a bad joke.  Just like his presidency.
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:06:24
"Cleansing poor people"  Where are these death squads?  Surely we have evidence of them.
"Cancelling medical aid/ raising insurance premiums"  Your fucking joking right?  or are you 12.   My vision insurance is now equal to my health insurance was 10 years ago, and my health insurance is now equal to my mortgage.  That's all on Obama and the so called affordable care act.
"Ostracizing the foreign community" Um yea..  legal immigrants are fine.  If you're here illegally.. then get the fuck out.
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:52:40
I actually read it before you linked and you are wrong.  "every" not every.  "30 days" far from it.
@_date: 2018-01-20 14:33:50
You think 90% of America wants to provide amnesty for illegal aliens....  You need to get out of your bubble, dude.
@_date: 2018-01-21 18:49:03
No.  I'll be retiring long before someone who spends $10 on a coffee, and I can pass wealth down to my children  providing a better life for them.
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:12:07
Exactly my point.  I want to pay for a single item and nothing else from a vendor.  How does LN provide any benefit?
@_date: 2018-01-20 03:41:58
No agenda.  It's just stupid.  If I want to do one transaction, I'm going to get charged to open a channel, then again for the actual transfer, and then again to close the channel.   Brilliant! 
@_date: 2018-01-19 10:26:41
Or you could open a request.  Not to discount all the stories in here, but the last (and admittedly) the only request I've opened was resolved in 24 hours.
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:37:20
I've been using BTC off/on for about four years, and in the last year its become unusable.  That's not my fault.
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:16:26
I just don't think the average user (myself included) is going to be doing  any where near the volume to justify double charging fees
@_date: 2018-01-20 14:34:11
@_date: 2018-01-19 21:16:01
Yeah.   This is a fucking terrible idea.
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:28:46
Sucks for BTC but that's life.  You can't force adoption.
@_date: 2018-01-20 16:14:59
that's a quote from Obama with context put in instead of "there" and "it".   
*edit, and to address another of your points.  I whole heartedly agree.  Merit based immigration is the only way to go.
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:26:30
Sorry, i mistook that bit.  Generally "cleansing" has a different connotation to it, and admittedly I read your post rather quick.  Regardless, I'm fine with a pussy grabber in office.  There was nothing incorrect in what he said in that tape.  There are plenty of gold diggers who will let people do what they want.  That's just reality. Any democrat who cries about it is a total hypocrite since they are fine with a man who stuck a cigar tube up an interns twat. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 14:29:30
  Misread your post.  Yes.  Republicans prioritize citizens over illegal aliens.  As they should.
@_date: 2018-01-20 16:21:35
On that we agree.
@_date: 2018-01-20 16:10:37
sorry for your feelings.
@_date: 2018-01-24 13:46:48
Remember friendster?
@_date: 2018-01-19 08:24:40
Maybe.  maybe I only want to buy one item a month.  Maybe just one a year.  I'm not going to pay capital gains on a bunch of small transactions.  That's stupid and only a stupid person (if in US) would do that.
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:53:51
Amazingly awesome.
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:17:10
Double charging.
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:30:25
Sorry.  I can't hear you over all the crying coming from your sweltering vagina.
@_date: 2018-01-21 15:34:28
I'm fine with brewing my own coffee at home.  It's just as good at 10% of the cost.
@_date: 2018-01-20 14:36:42
I don't find it offensive to call shitholes shitholes.  We have plenty of then here in the states.  Look at every city that has been run my Dems for the past 50 years.

"Not duplicable"  Today we fork bitcoin aluminum
@_date: 2018-01-20 02:22:08
If you are trying to convince me BTC is shit, you're doing a good job.
@_date: 2018-01-20 16:13:07
so my fees for BTC are not going down at all if I want to do a single transaction.   It's still a shit product.
@_date: 2018-01-20 00:13:04
Double charging is definitely ingenious.  I'm just not naive enough to think it's a good idea.
@_date: 2018-01-24 13:46:20
It's called the truth
@_date: 2018-05-04 13:14:21
Their response...  Ctrl-A.  &lt;Delete&gt;
@_date: 2018-06-20 12:29:56
You think the clerk at the breadline can accept BTC?  You realize he is forced to charge whatever the government says he can?
@_date: 2018-06-20 12:35:08
Indeed I did.  Thanks for the polite correction.
@_date: 2018-02-27 11:34:51
Actually.  It's exactly how it works.  Maybe that's why you don't understand.
