You realize that this sentence is literally right there in the sidebar:
"With Bitcoin, you can *be your own bank*."
So now we've been told Bitcoin is:
* A currency *or* a commodity *or* a distributed ledger, whichever is most convenient to call it at any given time
* A "TO THE MOON" investment *or* something for which the price does not matter
* A mature protocol *or* still experimental
* Trustless, except when you trust mining pools and exchanges not to fuck you over
* Instant, except that you need a fee to get a transaction to propagate with any speed
* Fee free, except for the aforementioned transaction fees, percentages deducted when you convert to/from fiat, and service fees tacked on by merchants when you buy in Bitcoin
* Scalable, except for the horrific confirmation times and rapidly/infinitely growing blockchain
* Convenient, except that you should store any amount of funds larger than a cup of coffee's worth completely offline for security's sake
* Anonymous, except when it is completely open and traceable
* And now we can add *"it lets you be your own bank, except when you shouldn't"*
I see now. Bitcoin is everything, and nothing, all at once. Bitcoin is the quantum superposition of all states. Bitcoin is whatever you want it to be. The impossible is possible, with Bitcoin. The unattainable is attainable with Bitcoin. I'm just waiting for  to accept Bitcoin.

Yes, and it has such potential that it has dropped steadily over the past year and has now lost 2/3rds of its value.
But this thing is *due* to pay out now if you just keep pulling that lever!

You're barking up the wrong tree; when Flooz existed, most of the subscribers here were still being toilet-trained.

It is not possible to reverse Bitcoin transactions, ever.
It's one of Bitcoin's "strengths".

You realize that if you have "no intention of paying it back", they don't just say "oh, shucks," and walk away, right? They will take you to court, you won't show up (or you will and they will win, particularly once they subpoena this Reddit post admitting you had no intention of paying them back), and they will garnish your future wages until they are repaid.
Oh, but that's right, none of that's gonna matter because the apocalypse is going to occur, dollars will become worthless, and yet magically somehow the Internet (not to mention power generation and distribution) will keep working just fine and you will be a Bitcoin zillionaire.
You are either too young or too simple-minded at the moment to be doing anything whatsoever involving money.

TIL financial security is equivalent to playing a fucking alpha video game.

That's funny, because if I were counterfeiting bills the first thing I would do is buy a bunch of Bitcoin with them, and then cash them out into clean bills.
Man, that's convenient.
@_date: 2014-05-12 14:42:03
This is no problem for enormous mining farms capable of pumping millions of dollars into infrastructure.
For the little guy, of course, it gets that much harder to make a dime.
This is actually good news.

Upvote for actually not butchering this quote like nearly everybody else on the Intertubes does.

I heard this in Chandler's voice from *Friends* because I am an old.
"Could Bitcoin *be* any more decentralized?"
@_date: 2014-08-13 14:38:15
Yes, and you would be lucky if you earned 10 cents per day.
@_date: 2014-05-12 15:20:33
Yep, it's that easy! Just have an idea, duh! And then pull yourself up by your bootstraps and make it happen!
Of course, then a bigger fish will come along, steal your idea, destroy you and leave you for dead, because they had more resources to begin with. But hell, that's just the free market at work, right? Oh, no, wait, don't tell me, the better product will win out in the end, because... something something mumble invisible hand.

Ewwww, the FED said something GOOD about Bitcoin? That's it, Bitcoin is no longer cool, sell everything, pack it up, jumped the shark, it's all over.

Shame on every one of you.

Yes, he can. That's his point. Anybody can do it, because all you're doing is paying for things with gift cards.
All you're proving is that you have the capability to perform basic financial transactions. Congratulations.

Just reminding you that you will never, ever be one of them. And your new masters will have even more control over you than the old ones.

That may not be a very good saying to use. Rollercoasters always end where they began: at the bottom.

"To celebrate Bitcoin".
No. They did it because a front page headline is about Bitcoin. They change their logo often to reflect a headline.
Example: If the headline were "Bitcoin Foundation Member goes on rampage with crossbow, kills 125", the logo would still be a Bitcoin.

I agree! I bought several million Beanie Babies back when the price plummeted, and I'm just waiting for right time to cash out, man!
@_date: 2014-05-12 14:33:12
Right, because money from all of the drugs and stolen goods bought with Bitcoin never goes toward extortion, theft, murder, mayhem, genocide, rape, fraud, deception, or poisoning the environment. Those cartels are just looking after our best interests.
You're adorable. We'll be keeping our eye on you.
@_date: 2014-08-15 23:35:55
Good. The sooner companies allow for payment in Bitcoin, the sooner they will see that only the most rabid right-wing lunatics actually want to pay with it.
