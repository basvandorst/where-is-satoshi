Is that 25 percent of the profit, or 25 percent of the whole transaction?

I love seeing posts like this. Gives a noob encouragement.

I started not to long ago and I put money in every week, and I just got a little over .1 and pretty proud of it. The more the better!

Hey guys, I'm new I got my first buy at 10k earlier in the week. I'm curious, I see the dca which i get is a good idea but what I dont understand, why would you buy high?? Why not just let that amount build up in the exchange until it drops.... Thats like half the profit potential if half your buys are high. Also, why wouldnt you sell when it skyrockets, not take any profit, and reinvest when it drops again? Or leave the profit in bitcoin. I'm going to hodl too. I'm pretty sure if you remain patient and really follow this theres a lot more profit. But like I said, I'm new and i was wondering if anyone had reasons for just buying every week on the dot and never selling. You could rebuy anyways?

Noob here. Been reading a lot, but THESE words are all confusing. Lol.

2fa is the authy app and pin code to login? I went to security settings and nothing else was there. My email is my general one. Woops. Why is that bad?

I'll have to learn more about this. Chinese. Lol.  I have another phone though
@_date: 2019-06-30 15:47:29
Thats interesting. Never switched out a hard drive I just assumed windows was installed on there so password would still be there.
@_date: 2019-06-29 20:53:59
Im new but from reading and looking at past behavior I think it will raise. It seems steady right now. My first time buying was around 10k and I almost sold at 13k because i thought it was gonna tank and I should have because it did, and bought back in when it did. I bought more at the dip around 11.5k so I'm looking good now if it starts skyrocketing like that again I'm going to attempt to sell and buy back in. Either way, I'm hodling just want to see what I can do to increase earnings. Wont buy again till a big crash.

What is idex?
@_date: 2019-06-30 14:20:52
Right come on

I almost used robinhood to avoid fees and make small gains in trades but you also cant withdrawal on there which defeats the whole purpose of bitcoin. Makes me a little upset like you dont even own it and I think it will harm bitcoin I think it needs to be used if it is to succeed
@_date: 2019-06-30 17:54:01
My first thought was like well what if someone sends that on the LN and withdraws into a seperate wallet or something? Couldnt people rip people off that way? Its difficult to grasp all this. Lol
@_date: 2019-06-30 17:55:30
Isnt the LN faster transactions too? I thought that was the point or it still takes a few days? I feel bitcoin needs to adjust to be instant for adoption
@_date: 2019-06-30 16:26:25
And those btc are locked up on the regular network, to prevent people scamming. Right?
@_date: 2019-06-30 03:34:23
Thanks man. Gemini has already been doing all that. I'll probably stick with it until I have a decent amount to put in a good wallet. I read about people switching phone service to a new phone getting all your apps and getting into it there so I was trying to find a way to avoid that
@_date: 2019-06-30 16:19:01
So dumbed down a bit, you use it through the lightning network setting a specific amount transferred over then theres a fee to go back onto the blockchain and sell for fiat correct? New to all this.
@_date: 2019-06-30 16:06:30
This is what i would do. To avoid breaking anything.
@_date: 2019-06-30 14:15:08
I agree with this this is what i was about to say, connect it to an external monitor and do some research on getting past the password. I think it would be easier than switching hard drives I believe youd still need the password if you do that. There may be another way to just recover the bitcoin on a new device?
@_date: 2019-06-30 02:35:00
I'm new, and i have a rule im going by. Keeping track of all my buys (bought xxx btc at this amount) and not selling that amount until it increases atleast 25 percent. Say I make a new buy at a different price, I can sell that amount for profit and still hodl the other amounts. Then reinvest when low. If I feel it will go higher I'll wait a bit like im doing now, but never sell if its under 25 percent. Also never taking profits, either keeping it in btc or reinvesting it later

If the phone dies, will the bitcoin go? I might just go somewhere that has a printer. Lol. Eh i should probably just get a hardware wallet. Depositing from wallet to exchange cost money? I need to watch some videos on this stuff. This is chinese to me
