If the attacker got a hold of your BIP0038 encrypted priv key, and ran it against known password libraries using a botnet. It would find a 7 digit passphrase potentially faster than a few years. If they had the full paper wallet, and checked the public key and saw 50btc. They may try even harder. I like 12 digits at least.

Satoshi burned his 1,000,000 bitcoins from the early days. But how do we prove that he didn't have a backup somewhere in his mom's basement? Also, eventually, the code/algorithms will be upgraded as quantum computing grows and lost/older funds may be recoverable as they may have used crackable key generation techniques. So a mechanism could be found, but not for a while.

As much as they try, there will always be a way to encrypt your information if you want to. So this will give criminals all the tools they need to hack us from Russia and China while avoiding any level of risk or prosecution. Multi-sig encryption is the answer. Family networks, trusted friends, etc. 5/5, 7/10, etc. Police can subpoena people to unlock keys when there is a criminal case.

Did you create them 100% offline from a clean Linux boot? Ubuntu, Tails, etc? 
Did you print them directly from that linux install with the printer hard-wired?
If so you're probably ok, but what if they fall into the wrong hands? Can be easily opened and swiped. I always recommend that PK's are BIP0038 encrypted with a long and strong passphrase that you can easily remember or store separately. If you use a really good and long BIP0038 passphrase with upper lower case, numbers, symbols, etc., it's ok to store a PDF of the pk's in your email or dropbox. It would take hundreds of years for a botnet to crack if they could even get it.

Ok, so lets say that the multisig key storage is on other peoples phones. A subpoena would be requesting that a persons phone be unlocked by 5/5 of the multisig holders. In this case, and most, it would not be self-incrimination. So legal?
@_date: 2016-04-14 21:09:18
If there is a police subpoena for you to unlock a phone or drive, and you don't, that is a jailable offense as you be in contempt. Same as if you were given a subpoena to turn over a piece of evidence in a criminal case. That is the law. The problem is mass surveillance and access to information outside the court system. So multisig would require a DA to supply evidence to a judge to get warrants. That is in coherence with the law and the rule of the land. 
If you were in possession of a piece of evidence, such as a document, and were given a subpoena to turn it over and shredded it. Then you would be in violation of the law. 
At any time the police can subpoena Google, Facebook or any other online service for your information. So what's the difference then?

I want to create a colored coin service for govt. and municipalities for land and car registries. Would replace local paper property deed registries which are ridden with error and corruption with a public database on the blockchain. Users will actually be able to buy and sell houses with minimal red tape. (Following all laws of course).
Also a blockchain DMV with car registration of vin insurance and such. End users just need to install a mobile app which will use so information is public but hashed and multisig is used for updates/sales, etc. Quite simple but I'm not a coder.
Also blockchain based identity is the  priority right now. One name is working on it but it seems to have slowed down. Kind of the first peg to get all of this going. Complete ownership of your own identity and proof of existence that you are who you say you are.

Before then, as TX's increase, fees will drive mining. Before the last coin is mined, fees will outweigh the block reward. As block size grows with transaction volume, the equilibrium will balance everything else out. You win the block you win the coin. Whether it's a block reward or mining fee reward.
So when will the two lines cross? When will the block reward be equal to the miners fee reward? Well before 2140 for sure.

So you're an IT professional? You need to learn how to use BTC correctly.
Get an outstanding mobile wallet. Breadwallet or Mycelium. Use this for your pocket money. 1-2 BTC max.
Setup electrum for your personal wallet. Using a TAILS USB boot is the best and safest. (And most secure because the persistence will be encrypted). So that will be your larger fund storage.
With BTC, I have been paying my DISH bill monthly, bought a year of VPN at PIA, making donations at Wikimedia &amp; No-script, paying for items on Purse.io, buying GYFT cards, spending at Overstock, and also playing some dice and stupid stuff. Never had a problem and everything has worked very well and fast.

We at an extremely undervalued point right now. With $1B in VC money in BTC startups in just 2015, and with 2016 probably doubling that, undervalued is an overstatement. BTC will outperform all over investments over the next 10 years.

The $19 and $118 prices will be blown out when BTC hits $10,000 and then $50,000 and beyond.

Any wallet that is shared with a vendor, such as a gaming site, online wallet, shopping with escrow, etc. should all be multisig (2/2 or such). Because in that case, it's not hosted. It's on the blockchain. Never should there be a time where coins are out of your control until they are spent.

I have to say, there is some great LEGAL stuff on the Dark Web. Of course there is illegal stuff there too, but many of the big sites have a very powerful ratings system and honestly, most of these vendors are just looking to provide excellent customer service and value. (Ebay? Amazon? cough cough) Whether you are buying an iPhone, computer, dishes, or something else., many have multisig escrow and you release the funds after receiving the products. Even Morgan Spurlock bought a watch on the dark web. With an FBI agent watching! 
Create a TAILS USB and run TOR. Enjoy. It also comes with Electrum for super tight coin  security.
But there are some risks. First is if you get your coin via Coinbase or Circle, etc., they can possibly tell that your coins are going to a DW site. So Tumble them first. And there is the occasional DW site exit scam. So if you send coins to buy something, do it fast and don't let anything sit on there.

When I hold bitcoin, I really feel like I'm holding something of value. But what am I holding? Just numbers. I'm holding electrons. Very light and airy.

How else is there supposed to be a way to hash information directly to the Bitcoin blockchain without using OP_RETURN? Pay the fee, do what you want. They just don't want bloat. But they can't control it. You can use it for what you want if you pay the fee.

I love cash. The way it feels and smells. It's easy and fast. And it's FREE (to use). I've started spending more cash as it's better for small retailers as they avoid CC fees. The only thing is that it's harder to keep track of spending.
Can we put actual dollar bills on the blockchain by using serial numbers as entropy? Like a digital Where's George?
BTW, I love spending bitcoin just as much, it's just there are few brick and mortar places to spend it.

Rationality has no place in the banking system, or even in capitalism. The same shit is still going on. CDO's are still being issued and given high ratings by the same corrupt institutions that issued and rated them in the past. There is a teetering crash about to take place.

This is the dude that ripped off a huge portion of the mining community with the KnC Neptune scandal. Me no trust him. He's all about money.

You're combining the 2 services.
When I buy something online and Coinbase is the processor, the bitcoin is immediately accepted with zero confirmations. The vendor is paid the money at the end of each day. Whether it's BTC, $USD or a combination.
The purchasing/instant buy service they offer isn't connected. Although they have have some of it cross over. It's possible but they usually don't discuss those types of details.

@_date: 2016-01-21 18:39:22
If anonymity is your goal. Lather (wash in an exchange by converting to an altcoin, trade for another then sell for btc on another exchange), rinse (via a tumbler), repeat. Then repeat again. Then store in a wallet that you will only house washed coins. But remember, almost every purchase can also back track to other coins you spend. So there's never a perfect method except lathering, rinsing, and repeating every time you spend with a vendor.

Yes, it's safe. Make sure you also use 2FA with Google Authenticator.
No, the coins are still traceable. Coinbase follows coins after they are sold for about 8 levels (unconfirmed). If you want anonymity, use a service.

Here's the reason. CHINA. They love to gamble and bitcoin is the perfect way to gamble. ZERO fees on their exchanges, so tons of volume from trading bots going back and forth at light speed. Currency woes with the Yuan are a reality and many people think that spurred this current bubble.
So there it is. Add all these things together and you get massive speculation, volatility and panic buys and sells. Hence the bubbles that will continue for many years to come.

Megaupload will be a distributed storage platform. Users will be able to "lease" out extra hard drive space and access it from anywhere. Kind of like a giant torrent network. Once it gets a strong user base, it will be impossible to shut down. And using bitcoin for payments will make payments impossible to shut down. Also, many apps can be bult on top of the technology. It could finally be the "public database" that everyone can use.
Imagine if you are a law firm and you want to computerize 100% of your files. You could go with a large cloud provider, but they aren't distributed and security can be an issues. With his system, you could store all our files in the cloud, full encrypted, and access them from anywyere at very fast speeds for low prices.

On a side note, there was over a year and a half of warnings about GOX before the crash, so those who lost, in my opinion, were blinded by greed. One Google search would have revealed numerous red flags well before the crash and burn.

There must be some form of digital currency. And like many others who will attempt an alt-currency, security becomes the  issue. So if they are creating the tokens, that is a huge risk. They can use digital tokens (FINCEN ALERT) that are easily exchanged with bitcoin and probably will be automated (Shapeshift). So even though they don't have the intention, the honey badger does what it wants.

You're wrong. They can easily hash batches of transactions to the main Bitcoin blockchain every minute, hour or day with minimal bloat and minute expense. This would make those trades immutable and proveable that they existed. Maybe even color the transaction and allow traders to use a digital token to prove ownership. But no, then they couldn't cheat.

You were using Bitcoin core on a laptop as your wallet? Why? No one does that anymore unless they want to run a full node, have opened up ports on their router, have great bandwidth and leave your computer on 24/7. Which I doubt is your case. Also, since you got a blue screen, it was probably from installing too much odd software, which is a no no when using a desktop with a bitcoin wallet anyway.
With electrum or mycelium you would just need to write down the passphrase and can recover easily. Once you recover your funds, move to a better wallet.

Bitcoin is worth more there. Just like it's worth more in other markets with capital controls and currency devaluations.

Agree. The market will create the equilibrium. That's considering that there is a level playing field. Miners don't have to mine.

You don't need any of those companies. Colored coins is a protocol you can use and develop yourself. It just uses torrent files to publicly distribute the document/proof and the hash of the document resides in an OP_RETURN field. Seed all the documents yourself and maybe even give incentive to others to seed and you have your own platform. No 3rd party needed. Could even integrate with STORJ/Maidsafe to seed all the torrent files for very minimal expense.
I am waiting for a simple app where I could create tickets to an event and sell them/give away and users keep them in their mobile wallet and use them for admission to the event. They can also frictionlessly trade or sell them for bitcoin instantly. Nothing exists like this on the blockchain.

I listen to the experts on this. And Andreas and Satoshi's writings lend to the fact that the Bitcoin blockchain is not for massive amounts of transactions and very high speed. The need to build sidechains and payment channels that sit on top of Bitcoin makes a lot more sense. I picture large blocks of transactions, whether it be money, stocks, property, etc. being written to the Bitcoin blockchain as simple hashes of the data "to prove their existence."

In recent weeks, however, all doubts about Bitcoin seemed to confirm. In Japan, the head of the last year with a crash failed Bitcoin platform Mt. Gox has been arrested for allegedly manipulates data and misappropriated client funds. In New York was an operator of an online currency exchange in court because he is said to have admitted that criminals could exchange Bitcoin against dollar, to launder money. Shortly thereafter, the cryptocurrency lost on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange "BitFinex" briefly a third of their value. Cared As so often in just six year history Bitcoin negative headlines. Given the extreme price fluctuations, the constant hacker attacks and other scams you could say so: The digital currency Revolution which was founded in 2008 by a developer using the pseudonym "Satoshi Nakamoto" proclaimed and received enthusiastically by techies, anarchists and other free spirits, devours its children.
But it is too early for a swansong. For all the problems despite having Bitcoin 2009 enthusiastically welcomed and declared dead in the past two years every now and again, affecting the wider economy. Even someone who does not want to escape for ideological reasons the conventional monetary system as some liberals or libertarians, who discovered the advantages of Internet money. Dealers and customers, large financial institutions to central banks already have more than one eye on the digital currency and especially the technology. The New York Stock Exchange has even recently launched its own index. The NYSE Bitcoin index tracked trading in international stock markets and ultimately represents a kind of official Bitcoin price in dollars. At present, a Bitcoin will cost about 228 dollars. However, this is not even a fifth of what was worth to her wedding two years ago the Internet currency.
The followers of Internet currency, whether from the German FDP or a Californian subculture, like have been raised in the tradition of Economics Nobel Prize winner Friedrich August von Hayek. Because the representative of the Austrian school forty years ago doubted that central banks can keep the value of money stable and crisis-proof, he propagated a "denationalization of money". Would private currencies authorized, Hayek's idea of ​​the state money would have to prove in a competitive environment. But no state of the world thinks of someone taking the currency monopoly out of hand. Federal Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble has the Internet currency Although recognized two years ago as a unit. But the euphoria German Bitcoin supporters he braked prompt: A "label" this is not. Recently laid by Schäuble, by "a suspected area" designated crypto currencies, as a kind of contaminated terrain.
To Inflation nobody should be in the Bitcoin world, however, worry
Bitcoin like two of the three main characteristics of money to meet: It is used as a unit and as a medium of exchange. Why it did not is good, is saving. Although there are fans who have gained in the early phase of a few Bitcoin at a bargain price, you keep on hard drive and USB flash drive and hope for capital appreciation. But larger sums of money to invest in real Bitcoin, which recommend themselves lead developer of the software. Until further notice remain the currency "an experiment" warns the Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen: "When I hear that someone puts his life savings in digital money, I cringe." Because the price of Bitcoin to dollars or euros only through regulate supply and demand on the Internet exchanges, the price can drop abruptly when someone loses the desire for his crypto money and sold it.
To Inflation nobody has to worry in the Bitcoin world, however. The total amount is limited to 21 million. In the virtual world, users can put a few Bitcoin for a rainy day when they calculate regularly all completed transactions within the network and confirm. This verification, called mining "not only makes work. It also requires each time a higher computing power - which can also increase the cost of electricity.
Recently, however, considerable interest is even at banks, have only ignored and then viewed with suspicion Bitcoin, awakens. The American investment bank Goldman Sachs has contributed $ 50 million in the Bitcoin payment service provider Circle. The Swiss bank UBS explored whether the application behind Bitcoin technology further brings their daily operations. "Block chain" means the chain of transactions that can track all network members. Even Bundesbank Executive Carl-Ludwig Thiele, libertarian Gedankenguts rather unsuspicious can "block chain" abgewinnen much good. The management of all for all "ensures transparency and can protect against manipulation," says Thiele.
Alarmed, banks and payment service providers are, however, because it allows "block chain" that transfers vonstattengehen quickly and inexpensively. Transfers abroad or remote parts of the world, where perhaps people have no bank account, but an Internet access, do not pass through intermediate banks and therefore do not take several days, but no more than ten minutes. And the costs often account for only one-tenth of what demand money senders as Western Union of its customers. The banks are in a dilemma: Make the block chain technology advantage to them facilitates one hand the work. On the other hand it would have painful consequences for them. The cashless payments around the globe makes a year from more than 400 trillion, which the financial institutions brings $ 600 billion revenue. Do you offer cheap foreign transfers to block chain base to shrink necessarily their own income.
The block chain may survive as art - but what future for Bitcoin as a currency? Governments and central banks will not let the power over the money take. In addition, Internet giant will offer its own payment services or how Google Wallet or ApplePay, evolve so that Bitcoin might fall by the wayside.
Another major threat to cryptocurrency comes from among their own followers. Because the Bitcoin community threatens to divide itself: One group, led by two leading developers, wants to expand the limited since each technical capacity and make Bitcoin order for the masses. This group, including developers Andresen, has now introduced a new crypto version called Bitcoin XT. By contrast, the other group is concerned that Bitcoin this would be an ordinary transfer system - which the revolutionary original idea of ​​the inventors led ad absurdum.
So it could be that the former currency of the future will soon be past, only the technology behind it persists. But it is also possible that Bitcoin as a unit and a medium of exchange is becoming more popular. It would not be the first time that the Internet Totgesagte currency would live longer.

The Bitcoin currency experiment
Bitcoin is virtual money, for which no state guarantee. It is just as attractive as for anarchists for bankers.
Since there Bitcoin, the world is divided. Proponents of digital currency rave about the money without State interference, by a domination-free monetary zone and the biggest upheaval since the existence of the Internet. The others hold Bitcoin for unregulated and downright dangerous because it opens anarchists and criminals floodgates for windy shops. In times of financial crises when central banks pumping immense amounts of money in the market or States are on the verge of bankruptcy, the fans of Internet currency to see confirmed. In phases when Bitcoin towards state clearly currencies lose value and constantly aware new criminal activities on the Internet exchanges, the skeptics have the upper hand. Either way leads to Bitcoin and behind it forming technology in future hardly a way past: at the expense of banks, for the benefit of bank customers and, as die-hard fans say, to the delight of the whole world.
At first glance, appear to be extremely strange Bitcoin currency. Even the name is misleading. Because there are no coins to touch, but in Bitcoin is a pure arithmetic unit, which is stored in a digital land registry. The book has not been centrally but by the computers of all users, who are grouped together to form a network. Whoever acquires Bitcoin, so do not buy money to touch, but an encrypted formula - why Bitcoin is also referred to as crypto currency.
Bitcoin - the system appears abstract
Bitcoin has, like all the other currencies which consist only of letters and numbers, a problem: The system seems abstract. Just the idea that not states and central banks regulate the money market but networked computers is, for many people, who have grown up in the traditional financial system, difficult to imagine. And that money is only based on crypto algorithms and can not be touched and passed as coins or bills, just to cash in love Germans must seem like an absurdity. In addition, the technology seems complicated for many who have not grown up with the Internet and have just become accustomed to perform most banking transactions online.
Anyone wanting to use Bitcoin only to pay or trade, can register with a provider, download the software and then buy from the Internet exchanges Bitcoin against Euro. The virtual currency unit then ends up, as in everyday life, in a wallet that is on the Internet "Wallet" and is stored on your computer or smartphone. When shopping with Bitcoin you type his personal code into the smartphone or in a Bitcoin terminal. So basically it does not much different than online banking.
As a unit of account, the Internet currency is receiving increasing support. There are now more than 100, 000 merchants that accept Bitcoin as a means of payment such as a credit card - just that during the settlement with the national currency incurred less fees. In some Berliner bars can pay for his beer into Bitcoin, in a hair salon in Hannover his haircut. The most attention received churches in America and England that accept Bitcoin for the collection. The most popular is the cryptocurrency at online retailers and their customers: companies such as Microsoft, Tesla, Dell and Expedia accept Bitcoin, also via PayPal are Bitcoin payments recently possible. And who ordered his food at Edeka online, can pay via BitPay since this spring. Bananas, bread and butter for Bitcoin - which is the norm? Still is the Internet currency "a niche cash," says Bernhard Rohleder, Director General of the Digital association Bitkom. But he believes that Bitcoin "established as a complement to other means of payment" in the next few years mainly because of lower transaction fees.
At present about 100 000 times a day is paid with Bitcoin around the world; what is a trifle compared with the 65 million transfers and direct debits, which are settled in Germany alone on weekdays. If you follow, however the results of a representative survey of Bitkom, the mainstream of society could achieve Bitcoin might. 36 percent of Germans - and eleven percent more than in 2014 - can imagine to buy Bitcoin or use. This corresponds to 25 million potential users in this country.
The great attraction of this alternative and decentralized monetary system is that members make to each other shops without a middleman or a bank is turned on and causes costs. The great confidence of all users ahead of each other. Bitcoin enables "people to free themselves from the tyranny of centralized trust" as Michael Casey and Paul Vigna in her recently published book in German "crypto-currency" write. Although it sounds so, Casey and Vigna are not revolutionaries, but seasoned business journalists of the Wall Street Journal.
In the fight for the recognition of Internet currencies occasionally develop unusual alliances. A fantasy bookstore from the alternative milieu Berlin-Kreuzberg in the same boat as a noble Franke, who was for a time as Germany schillerndster and full of promise most politicians: Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg places powerful for Internet currencies over backwards. The financial system is now "outdated and inefficient", quibbled former CSU Minister and now consultant in one of his rare interviews now. Therefore Krypto currencies would offer "a tremendous opportunity to make our established payment and money remittance system simpler and cheaper".

Are they? Do they use timestamped, non reverseable, encrypted ways to write to their databases? Looks like these supposedly secure databases are being hacked on a large scale. Once private blockchains scale up, an attacker will need mining hardware on such a large scale that it wouldn't be profitable to do. Just like Bitcoin is now. 
To me these fiat private blockchains will only improve banking and interface with Bitcoin much better than the systems that exist now. Looks at PayPal and Venmo for example. Still 3 days to get your money out. Bad for consumers, bad for business.
@_date: 2015-09-16 18:54:56

I think the mining of a private blockchain by a bank or a network of banks will vastly improve the archaic systems that exist right now. We all want faster frictionless transactions. The end of wasteful currency exchange fees and remissions fees. Bitcoin is in a perfect place to interface with these new systems since it's already years ahead of them. Bitcoin is the immutable, global blockchain that all these smaller ones can write to for security and verifiable private ownership of money, property and the thousands of other applications that people come up with.

Bitcoin will update it's encryption/fork if we ever get close to that. And people will move their coins to new hardened addresses/private keys. Old/burned coins may be able to be recovered. This could lead to Satoshi moving his stash too! I think we will see this within the next 20 years.
@_date: 2015-09-18 14:31:17


YES WE DO! 
Do you know what T+3 means? 3 days to settle a trade. And then 2 days to withdraw your funds to your bank. That is way too long. Why so slow? Old and antiquated middle men (i.e. Cede and company, banks) taking time to verify the authenticity of the transactions. With an immutable and trustless database, t+3 (+2) turns in to t+1 hour. Also, with the current stock markets, you don't even own the stock. There's no more certificates any more. It's just an IOU that can be denied and confiscated at any time.
So if you think it's important to free up $10 Billion in assets that are constantly in escrow or whatever you call it, then you need an immutable trustless database where the playing field is level.

Cool! I have a bunch of more ideas for you while you're working on it.
1. Allow formatting and print size adjustments. I prefer dollar bill size so they fit in my fiat wallet. But some may want larger or smaller. Maybe 4 different size options with a custom feature as well.
2. Allow the using of background images/pictures. Again, a specific size could be loaded on to the phone like a paper wallet template. (see bitcoinpaperwallet.com) You could also include some Foldy branded backgrounds in the app with your app name and such. People like pretty paper wallets and it's advertising for you.
3. Quick and light Blockchain explorer. I have not found any iPhone app that is a good, simple block explorer. This is monumentally useful for quickly checking the value of paper wallets or any public keys. Make sure you allow camera and cut and pasting of keys. Could even show # of confirmations, and such.
4. Public key history. App should remember the public keys (only) of the paper wallets you made. Very useful. Also the list should include live values, # of conf., etc.
4a. Alerts when a paper wallet has been swiped. Also, nothing exists like this. Coinspy is a cool service but it's web based. Need a mobile version.

So explain to be the reason to use Bitwage? To store your funds in BTC that will ultimately be converted back to fiat anyway? (And accepting volatility risk?).

Like big discounts or international transfers? I'm trying really hard to like the fact that I can use a bitcoin debit card. But my Target debit card at least gets me 5% off!

But for the most part, you can't win unless you go completely off the grid. For example, a friend doesn't want to get EZPASS because she doesn't want to be tracked. There are cameras at every toll that take record every passing license plate and film drivers. But she still waits in long lines to pay with cash because of some presumed level of anonymity.

And then I get this vision of the [creepy Mastercard guy] ( and I feel like a member of Anonymous. Life has gotten weird.

Bitcoin is most useful when it's stable. No matter what the price is. I was ok with the $200's because I could buy and spend with little worry. Now if you wait for a few minutes, you could lose any value you would get. So downward volatility sucks for everyone.
@_date: 2015-11-11 16:18:18
I think alt-coins provide value. They are a gateway for new users to tinker around and learn about crypto currencies. A way to learn about mining and how it works. Many have strong communities that are fun and welcoming. I loved Litecoin and Dogecoin and mined both of them when BTC was already out of reach. Now I'm 100% obessed with BTC. So the ramping up with less risk was an important step. Also, Open Office? Seriously? Who even uses that anymore? At least use Google Docs.

Ok but what's the point? Why not store fiat and just buy BTC when you need it? Seems like extra steps for no benefit. Please tell me what the benefit of doing what you just said provides.

A bitcoin debit card is like plugging a square peg into a round hole. There will be fees. Processing fees, transfer fees, and the same days of waiting by the merchants. It only gives the consumer the opportunity to spend bitcoin via a swipeable debit card. Your bitcoin is sold by a payment processor and then the merchant gets the fiat. I'm sure Coinbase and Bitpay want to get there as soon as possible because the first one to market will take off like wild fire.
This will be a big step in the right direction if it gains any traction but it's not a long term solution. POS terminals need to accept bitcoin directly via displayed QR codes or NFC. It's going to be a long slog through the mud before that happens.

Bitaddress.org on a offline computer, USB stick Linux booted, hardwired to a printer. And ALWAYS BIP38 the private keys. Keep the password in a safe place.
If you use a nice long and unique BIP38 encryption passphrase, you can store the encrypted paper wallets anywhere you want. In your wallet, on dropbox, in email, even here! It would take 1000 botnets 1000 years to crack them.
I also made some nice paper wallet designs to go with Bitaddress.org. You just need to edit the HTML file from Github. Pretty easy to also make your own designs.

I think that bitcoin wallets are very easy to use. But until a major corporation comes out with one, most people aren't willing to download, install and send funds to one which to them is by some developer and untrusted. All my friends have 1-2 BTC in Coinbase. But they are just letting it sit there, like a 401K to hedge against it hitting big. They love their debit/credit cards, freq flier miles, etc.

IMO the halvenings are already worked in due to:
1. Cost of mining equipment. Miners who are buying more equipment have worked this into their business models. The halvening could put them out of business if not so.
2. It seems that the supply will be reduced by the reduction in block rewards but the majority of volume is not from miners and the demand for "clean" coins is minuscule. People just use mixers if they care about anonymity. There is plenty of supply and a surplus of BTC at the moment until volume ramps up. 5-10 years IMO.
3. Experience. In all my years following alt-coins, no block reward halvening has effected the price of a certain coin. Now I know that most bitcoiners look down on alts, but they are precursors for behavior and provide valuable learning experiences.

Are you using Bitpay for any type of storage? They can use any hot address they want since they control the private keys. Exchanges also re-use addresses all the time. You can see the Bitstamp hot wallet address anytime you want.
The only reason not to re-use an address is for storage. Technology right now can't crack a used address. But possibly within a few years.

Never had this problem before and not sure if OP checked the vendor prior to the item shipping. But most Person B's are legitimate Amazon international vendors who have accrued Amazon credit and cashing out in fiat would get kiled more than the 25% in fees, exchange rates and bank charges. Purse offers them a safe and secure way to exchange their Amazon credits for BTC. Which is what it's all about.

STORJ breaks up files and encrypts the pieces. You don't host a complete file, it's distributed. If nodes go down, files won't be lost. If you choose to be a node, the partition of your hard drive that is used for STORJ will be useless and unidentifiable by itself. I'm not saying that illegal files from child porn to hacked movies, games, music are good to store. But you will be protected by maths.

Before the system goes "public" it will have to scale large enough to accommodate tens of thousands of nodes. The algorithm will automatically redistribute data to nodes to offset when nodes go down. The data is duplicated across the network and constantly updated.


Do you understand the maths? The encryption is bulletproof. You will never host a complete file, just encrypted pieces that only the owner could access. That is why governments hate encryption.
Private keys must be stored properly and safely. This will be the paradigm shift in computing, when people take full responsibility for their digital possessions.
