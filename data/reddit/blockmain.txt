While the S&amp;P500 has gone up 80% in the past 20 years, middle income households have only seen a 15% increase. When you take money away from the stock market and put it in the people's hands, it makes the 1% less rich. Taking from the rich and giving to the people what we deserve. Just my opinion, but 33% of the wealth in the nation comes from 99% of the people, 33% comes from .99% and 33% comes from .001%.....

1. No way I am lending before the halving, I will only spread the need to invest now and wait. 
2. Ideally, up to $10,000
3. No interest rates, must pay 20% of the gains on the currencies trading price, and 90% of the loss
4. Any options, including indefinitely with the contract negotiated every 6 months
***Contract should be negotiated on a monthly, or 6 month basis****

It did help...but I got a new phone and new number..
I had already updated my phone number on Authy..
The email is the same as the one on CoinBase..
I "resetted" my number but in reality I had already updated it
I don't know what to do. The steps are not working. I already updated my Authy app to my new number and I have a different Coinbase Account now. It simply won't send this number a code, it still thinks its my old phone number. 
What can I do?

i just aced my macroeconomics final and literally it all makes sense now. Government uses the Fed to control the Money supply as THEY see fit, not the people or the world. thanks boys (or girls)

Government uses blockchain technology to give social services such as welfare funding. This way the people have exact knowledge of how much/where. Also the recipients can only spend their government aid in bitcoin. This way my tax dollars are not going toward someone to buy a new TV and sell it on Craigs List...
