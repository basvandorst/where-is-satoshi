Worked at a pet store. If you think a purebred line dog would ever find its way in a store... You're sadly mistaken.
They buy the dogs for 200$ and Mark em up to 87% profit margin min.
Edit: I suck at percentages. Meh it's a curse.

Ignorance. They really pull the wool over your eyes. claiming USDA approved breeders. ( Pet store animals are considered livestock FYI) and lying about the distance they pups are shipped from. How they're delivered ( when I saw them arrive in a semi covered in shit and no food or water that's when I started help build a case against them.) One of the owners even got a job working with the AKC in order to "certify" the "purebreds" easier. Researched one of the golden retriever "breeders" his brother? Was arrested for a meth lab on the same property.
Ive dedicated my time and energy to rectify the pain I've caused families in my ignorance. Teaming up with organisations to testify and help create legislation and make a difference. 
Thanks, ever have those days where after work your brain doesn't want to work anymore? This is one of those times with maths. Lol

Bullshit. Get a blood test.
And sorry I made a mathematical error. I'm not perfect. Either way Yorkie pups bought at 200$+/- sold for 1500-4000 dollars. You do the math then. 
Ill try to find the paperwork from Petland show purchase price and sale price.  Either way. Was a sales manager there for 3 years.
