For those of you who use Coinbase or the Bitpay Woocommerce plugin and have the plugins setup to automatically convert received Bitcoin/Altcoin to USD/EUR/etc I think I may have found a way to also use that feature with this plugin.  Please correct me if I'm wrong.
**How to convert received Bitcoin/Altcoin to USD/EUR/etc**
Bitcoin/Altcoin to Bank Account -
1. You will need to create an account on any crypto trading platforms (Bitstamp.net or Poloniex.com or Bitfinex.com, etc)
2. Setup so that all your received payments are automatically forwarded from your MyCryptoCheckout account to your account on Bitstamp/Poloniex/Bitfinex/etc (enter your Bitstamp/Poloniex/Bitfinex/etc coin wallet address in MyCryptoCheckout payment box settings). And use the "autosell" feature (auto trade your cryptocoins to USD) on Bitstamp/Poloniex/Bitfinex/etc.
3. Using that functionality you don't need to worry if cryptocurrency prices go down or up. Within 1-2 hours after a cryptocoin payment has been received by you, your payment will be automatically converted to USD on Bitstamp/Poloniex/Bitfinex/etc and will be kept on your Bitstamp/Poloniex/Bitfinex/etc USD account.
4. Later you can withdraw your USD from Bitstamp/Poloniex/Bitfinex/etc to your own USA/UK/France/etc bank account

No matter what country you're in we should be helping the Polish citizens fight this.  We may all be in different countries but we're all under the same cryptocurrency total market cap. The easier it is for citizens of any country to invest the better it is for all of us.  There needs to be some sort of **universal cryptocurrency tax reform coalition** that goes ape shit anytime a country tries to pull something like this. 
Hell, if I'm not mistaken I think it only takes around 1200 tweets to get a hash tag trending on Twitter. At the time of this post there's almost 12,000 active subscribers in this subreddit.

CoinBase is ending support for their legacy Wocommerce plugin at the end of April, 2018.  They do not have a Woocommerce plugin yet for the new CoinBase Commerce service.  This looks like a way better alternative to Coinbase and Bitpay since it does not have the restrictions they do and you can use your own wallet.  Great job guys!  This is exactly what I was looking for.

Also, as I mentioned in there seems to be a known issue with the Coinomi wallet when you try to send forked bitcoins to another wallet via the QR scanner. 
You will have to manually enter the public address for the destination wallet or somehow copy and paste it into the send address for the Coinomi Wallet.
