Well the bitcoin whitepaper goes through all of that but I haven't seen the pic you're talking about
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:10:49
I would always keep 50-60% of my portfolio in BTC.
Alts that are a long term investment:
Alts with a great team:
As for tax implications it depends. In most of EU there are no taxes yet. From what I've read in a post, in France you get taxed when you liquidate your crypto and get fiat (not sure how true this is). 
Best exchange I've used is Bittrex. Period. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:59:32
The finite number also takes out inflation. Fiat is subject to inflation because the government can print as much as they need and eventually fuck up the country (Zimbabwe is an example)
So 21 million BTC is a finite number and no one can "print" more to inflate it.
Make sure to read the bitcoin whitepaper as well it has a lot of details.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:02:37
Sure no problem :)
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:44:04
I've been looking into them for some time
I'm more familiar with OMG so I will only talk about them
Great team
They want to decentralize banking. Literally.
Their platform will allow users to exchange between different fiats as well in the future for low fees.
The Ethereum Plasma update will allow for billions of transactions to take place and thus helping out OMG and their product
Vitalik Buterin is on the team

GODDAMNIT BOB. BE PATIENT!

After reading your reply all I could think of is "Fuck the SEC"
Now "Fuck the Federal Reserve" just came to mind
@_date: 2019-03-29 12:30:08
Well fuck me sideways and call me Stacey... I’ll be damned... I’m really impressed. 
@_date: 2019-03-28 23:51:15
Here you go friend;
@_date: 2019-03-03 04:44:46
Which HW would you recommended to use?
@_date: 2019-03-05 12:52:03
That would make a great sci-fi movie. 
@_date: 2019-03-01 21:29:16
There is no such thing as complete security, only the illusion of it. And HW wallets do have vulnerabilities.
@_date: 2019-03-09 09:04:44
@_date: 2019-03-01 18:20:26
The Exodus wallet looks like a great option.
In terms of a HW wallet I’m not too sure. There are still security concerns, specially in the Ledger and Trezor wallets. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:48:23
Well looks like the price will go up to 5000 as analysts have said before so you can still make it :)
@_date: 2017-08-12 20:29:27
Not all the time ��
Be reasonable man
@_date: 2017-08-12 20:21:38
Is it too late to buy? Or will the coin drop a bit as a correction
@_date: 2017-08-17 05:47:01
You can buy a maximum of €1000
@_date: 2017-08-12 20:07:37
Use Exodus for PC. There's also Copay for iOS.
Those are the ones I've used so far.
You can also get a Ledger Wallet which is cheaper than competitors
@_date: 2019-03-30 12:25:33
I think when we get to Mars as a species we will use a form of decentralized cryptocurrency. You know that makes me happy. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 20:09:29
I know that coinbase is the best at providing this service
You can also get a TenX card (or any other crypto card) or use Metal to spend your coins
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:42:54
No it's normal. Why haven't you linked it Coinbase in the first place. Those Winkelvii like to fuck around with people
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:40:55
And hodl it all night
@_date: 2017-08-12 20:15:50
Exodus for PC. Copay for iOS. Ledger wallet (hard wallet)
@_date: 2017-08-12 20:18:19
Then take me with you. Because it's a boring 'trip' without a fun companion that likes to get drunk and high all the time :)
@_date: 2019-02-04 15:07:08
Bitcoin community: Taking shit too literal from day one. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:28:46
I would put 50% in BTC, 25% in ETH and XMR each.
And really a year ago? WTF man! Just invest already this is the future of money. Decentralized and ungoverned by snobs. And whatever the fuck happens don't panic sell. Just go to the closest pub and keep on ordering beers until it all blows over. You can buy the dip while you're drinking (my personal favorite) and ride that bitch. BTC crashes because it is manipulated by external forces (political, miners switching,...) but it always doubles after every crash. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:59:06
Well I have considered a Litecoin mine more profitable. Haven't done it but looking at the numbers calculated on whattomine.com it looks like it
So try the site to calculate the BTC mining rig and return on investment. I would rather invest in BTC though
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:01:35
You can use Kraken. I know people that use Coinbase but I had a bad experience with them. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:59:35
I used Bitnovo.
See if you can buy through Kraken using a CC.
If you have cash you can use a Bitcoin ATM. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:35:33
Read the Bitcoin whitepaper and you'll have your answer. The answer is 'you should always invest in BTC'. But read it anyway it's 9 pages so try not to procrastinate. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:05:55
To add an extra point. The price is more or less different across all exchanges. That is called and arbitrage opportunity. Lets say there are exchanges X and Y. In exchange X the price of BTC is lower from that in Y.
What happens is that investors can buy BTC at a low price from exchange X and sell them at a higher price at exchange Y and taking in the profit. This will continue to occur until both exchanges have the same BTC price. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:39:08
No it depends on the coin. Litecoin is based on Scrypt. BTC is SHA256.
If you are gonna buy an ASIC miner you should be specific in what you want to mine, i.e.: a BTC miner is not gonna mine LTC.
If you are building your own miner then I think you can but a techie can answer this question better than me.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:22:18
Sure anytime!
The first $1 transfer takes more time for it to clear so don't panic :P
The transfers after that are faster but still do take 3-5 days max to clear and that's normal in bank transfers.
You have to create the Kraken account using SEPA in order to be able to transfer from your bank account. If, like me, you want to put people to work just go down to your local bank and they will help you to fill it. All the info on how to transfer is on Kraken site. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:31:32
No problem!
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:14:21
Try Kraken
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:10:30
It's always the case. I'm in Sweden now so I decided to send money from my bank account to Coinbase. I used CC before but the interest rate was high and transferring money is cheaper. So first you send $1 from your account to the account in Coinbase and wait for the transfer to clear. In my case it didn't and Coinbase still owes me $1.
So since I'm in EU I decided to use Kraken because it's based in Germany. Same procedure but this time it worked and I sent the rest of the money when the $1 reached my Kraken account. The rest is history. 
Edit: Coinbase are known for their bad customer service. I sent them an email of the problem and they replied 10 weeks later saying that I need to send some more info (which I already wrote on the previous email) and a screenshot of something. So yeah fuck them. 
@_date: 2019-04-06 07:34:17
I feel less stressed and more comfortable looking at this masterpiece.
*breathers in, breathes out*
Thank you Sensei. 
@_date: 2019-01-05 00:39:15
Eyyy what party?! I got no invite. 
@_date: 2019-01-12 08:35:49
“Hey hon! Would you like to check out these essential oils ������������‍♀️��‍♀️”
Shit I’m really bad at MLM BS. Oh well. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:45:21
Will check them out. Thank you. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 17:39:55
Where did you get the Bitcoin ATM from?
I'm not a techie but always wondered if I could set one up in my hometown. So I'm not sure if it's hard to do or not.
@_date: 2018-07-30 11:53:34
You go comrade!
@_date: 2017-07-31 11:11:41
Yeah when I saw it I thought that's new. Why would there be an mBTC but then again I thought I'm seeing things. Know what I mean
@_date: 2017-07-31 08:28:03
All I know is that the block size will increase
But I didn't know that you actually benefit from the split that way
If you hold BTC you get BCC automatically is that what you are saying?
@_date: 2017-07-31 11:39:52
What wallets can we us me for both coins simultaneously?
So what I'm getting from all of this is that BCC is gonna magically appear in the wallet next to BTC?(which I doubt is the case btw)
@_date: 2017-07-27 17:17:32
Yeah but that goes against what ICO are really about. Which is crowdfunding. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 12:55:57
So if I have btc in jaxx the bcc should appear after integration by itself?
And to a 1:1 ratio
@_date: 2017-07-31 09:16:52
And BCC will be traded at the current future price?
How will you claim them anyway
@_date: 2017-07-31 12:57:44
Will BCC be priced at its current futures contract?
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:50:38
How will the SEC do that? What are the restrictions?
@_date: 2017-07-31 13:29:13
Great! Thanks. But what about the market price of BCC?
@_date: 2017-07-17 20:58:12
So what will the 2 new coins be called after the BTC fork
@_date: 2017-07-31 14:11:22
It's too good to be true isn't it :P
@_date: 2017-07-31 06:18:39
For me it's as clear as fucking mud.
Actually wtf is bitcoin cash. Is it a futures contract? So when the coin splits BCC is created with the current price of the contract. Is that what's happening?
I'm telling you it's as clear as mud.
@_date: 2017-07-31 13:40:58
Just one last thing.
Will the BTC I have be converted to BCC?
Or will I get BCC (for free I guess) and keep my BTC
@_date: 2017-07-31 11:09:55
No no we saw it don't worry. Wtf are you using to send btc anyway? DHL?
@_date: 2018-12-24 01:26:40
Pomp followed me on twitter once. I barely use twitter and I followed him back. A couple of minutes later the fucker unfollowed me. I mean why the hell are you fishing for followers? So that they can listen to you Pomping bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-07-27 07:08:15
Oh ok so they are dealing with them as an IPO
There should be a liquid secondary market for the coin in order for it to be regulated
And does that apply to all coins or only the ones that are taking American investors and USD
@_date: 2017-06-02 02:27:50
What exchange do you use in Brazil?
@_date: 2017-06-02 11:35:03
Is there a minimum amount to buy if your not using an ID
@_date: 2017-06-02 11:52:44
I saw their site you only exchange BTC with cash
I'm not in the US though so I want something online
Buying with debit/credit card no ID
@_date: 2017-07-31 11:08:09
I think he means that the mining fee is more than what he is sending
@_date: 2017-06-02 11:33:29
Yes I am aware of that I am Brazilian as well my friend :)
Can you give me a website you use to buy BTC
