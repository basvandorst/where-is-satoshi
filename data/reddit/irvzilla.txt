I don't trade coins on margin but I have bought stocks on margin to go long . Assuming it is the same , then I imagine you can buy coin on margin to go long .

" maybe scale back the margin after large run ups because corrections is possible."

Luckily that's not what I said

The swings become smaller and smaller naturally over time until profitability is almost equal 
@_date: 2017-08-21 16:11:17
How have you not grasped that there would be an emergency difficulty adjnustment downwards , thus boosting profitability and bringing miners back 
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:45:57
Your a clown

Volatility will come down from where it's at now, but will never be totallly stable . So you are correct that difficulty will forever oscillate but the range will be much smaller than today providing incentive for miners to mine both chains as they see fit. Not one or the other

Stop shitting on bitcoin cash. If you don't like it then ignore it.

Because I don't want to see people lose their money .   I'm starting to see exuberance around this sub with people assuming 10k btc by years end.  Not saying it won't happen, just that a crash is also a possibility

Unless you don't mind widespread suffering of your family and friends then you probably don't want it to pop at all

how is that ok for justice?
@_date: 2017-07-28 22:51:17
Idk what that means.  Private key like password? Or the 12 word phrase that they give you ? 
@_date: 2017-07-29 01:27:59
I already have a wallet on coinomi .  I just wasn t sure what needed to be done to receive the btc
@_date: 2017-07-28 23:02:37
Blah ok .  So looks like I'm not gonna be getting any bcc
@_date: 2017-07-28 23:27:40
And what are my " keys "  
I use coinomi,  all I have is a pw and the recovery phrase .  Sorry for the newb questions 
@_date: 2017-07-27 21:46:07
My main concern is not this potential fork just the bickering amongst developers 
@_date: 2017-07-28 23:19:37
That's sketchy as fuck.  Gonna be alot of transactions 
@_date: 2017-07-28 20:47:44
That's my strategy man. I don't understand the technical of all this so I'm just moving my btc to a wallet and holding it until I can get some clarity . 
If it's just sitting in my wallet am I gonna get bcc somehow  Just magically added to my wallet ?
@_date: 2017-07-28 23:26:21
Import my keys to where?
@_date: 2017-07-28 23:49:30
Ok. It's starting to come together a little bit.  According to coinomi I have to export my private keys using a recovery tool , just to see them.  I'm making progress in understanding this whole thing.  I appreciate you taking time to explain this .

It's obvious to us but not the 65 year old man looking to stretch out his retirement account
