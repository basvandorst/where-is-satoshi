You hit the nail on the head. At the end of the day it is a quest for freedom - that tragic and inspiring monologue underpins the epic story of the human race. I too have known a brutal grind. When I first started out homeless I soon adopted a mantra which has stayed with me long after having built a growing empire: "let your HUNGER feed your HUSTLE". If I may adopt your definition of greed being a negative thing, then the explanation is quite clearly in sync with what you are expressing. I wasn't greedy back then - I had to hustle and learn to trade if I wanted to eat. I'm not greedy now either - I hustle because that is now a way of life. ��✈️��

I wrote about this same issue of Bitcoin price vs value a few months ago. ( It seems to be a common long running trend. People are greed driven so it doesn't surprise me. All the same it's important to never loose sight of what we all really came here for in the beginning. It's so much bigger than wealth.

100% accurate on BTC vs BCH. The Roots don't touch the core of what made BTC a legend.

Correct. The desire for money is a strange thing. If you know where you stand then you can manage that instinct to further your life and the lives of those you love and you can build a legacy which outlives you. Money for money's sake is always a dead end road. I guess it all begs the question, what is the definition of greed? And is greed always a negative thing?

This was only a test - I have something much much bigger under development. ;-) stay tuned

Yes, this is likely the issue. There is likely a unique method such as what you described (passphrase = hash[salt,pin]) and as a result, the logic works out in their favor as being a slight improvement over the rest of the industry players who only use raw BIP39.

Good job

Yes - okay. I see what you're saying. I haven't really looked into it deeply enough as you have. Thank you for the insights.

There is one technicality of BIP39 which causes it to be unreliable. Your discovery of what seems to be an empty wallet is the result of this issue of wallet portability. That same BIP39 solution will lead you to the correct wallet when used in the proper wallet provider. The answer to which provider is embedded in the initial riddle.

Lol do you even know what this is? It's a telegram channel that posts public updates on specific VIP Bitcoin wallets in real time... It's completely free. How is that a scam? Lol

Yes - security is critical. Your post just made you a target fyi so please exercise caution. Change your phone numbers etc. 
@_date: 2017-01-07 04:26:53
Wonderful explanation! Thank you for taking the time to write out these facts for interested individuals. I really appreciate your traditional fact-based Bitcoin philosophy - it is quite in spirit with the many things left by Satoshi. Continue spreading this priceless information and together we will all see our dreams of global cryptographically-driven freedom come to pass.

Absolutely thanks. Is there any particular auto posting tool you would recommend? I'm fairly new to Reddit and have only re ently taken up brainstorming how best to approach the platform.

Thank you for the excellent list of resources

xcoins is definitely quite legitimate. My company is actually working with the founder, Sergey, in improving the xcoins platform and getting feedback from the users etc to assist in further developments. I also run the xcoins Instagram account. 
I personally manage a team of traders who trade on the xcoins platform and am working to introduce a beta version of a P2P Leverage program for those traders and eventually anyone else who has some proven experience and wants to boost their profitability on the xcoins platform. 
If you would like to see the exact process used by me and my trading team, I have it all posted publicly online on our website here:  
Let me know if you have any more questions.

I had a similar experience with Coinbase. My account was verified to the maximum level and was in great standing. After using them for about a year I got a totally unexpected email telling me my account was being shut down for "regulatory compliance" reasons. I emailed the support team and politely requested more information on the exact reason for the abrupt termination of my account. After two days went by I got an email that basically restated what the initial notice had said in the first email. To say the least, I'm greatly disappointed. I was a strong supporter of the company for quite a while and was able to even have several of my professional connections open accounts with Coinbase as well.
Someone needs to get in the game as competition. Until coinbase has some legitimate and hot competition, they really can just keep on doing as they want without fear of loosing some of their bigger accounts and clients because there simply isn't another more integrated and user friendly service out there. smh

Same problem here. Getting verified in the crypto world is next to impossible for me, and yet I opened my Bank of America in about 20 minutes one afternoon. This is insane!
