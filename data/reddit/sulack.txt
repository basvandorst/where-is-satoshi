Fools buy bitcoin to get rich. Crypto is setup in a way that the user can be their own bank. Guys like are completely mixing up bitcoin and its market. 
Bitcoin's tech is the future of banking. 
Bitcoin's market is fucked. 
Calling bitcoin ponzi is just like calling Cash a scam because it is used in scams. There are people who are making money in bitcoin using ponzi methods, but the tech is completely separate from its use.

The problem is all based on the % of someones income. Rich people pay more for banking services, but less of a percent in comparison to their income. 
It might as well be a free lunch if your bank costs less than what you make while taking a poop break.

I'm almost 100% convinced bitcoin is here to stay and grow. Look at skins on the CSGO market. We now have a way of detaching an asset from the service that created it..... thats huge. It now means you can pass down "weapon skins" to your kids, that they (in theory) can use in any service that supports that exact digital asset.
Its amazing.

People are stockpiling bitcoin in case society succeeds. It is Internet money, don't straw man. 
@_date: 2019-03-23 00:30:49
Evenif you didn't leave instruction, it's the gift receivers fault if they don't understand the value of the gift. If there was a way to tip people in CSGO skins then they should apretiate the gift of value.
It's petty that the service industry gets mad about gifts. That's all a tip is, a gift. Somehow culture has made it part of their wage.

Ok **Puts on tinfoil hat**


We needed slavery like we needed the dinosaurs. Both  horrible and a fact of nature. Both unnecessary in modern times.   


We use government all the time. From the governing nature of a homes rules, to the large scale force of millions of people.     


Its always nice to think one is not a part of the sheeple. Many very smart people work long and hard to make a nice world for their fellow man without a need for political unrest in their lives.

There will always be some form of governing body. At any scale of human oranization, for hundreds of thousands of years its been this way. If you were in charge of the movement of millions of people, you would have to kill a few along the way.
Pretending that somehow you know how the planet would run without a governing body is only a lie to yourself. 
Bitcoin is first of its kind in 14 billion years (as far as we know). Dont act like decentral governance is an obvious thing.

What you don't seem to get is that isn't money. It's a solution to a destributed computation system. A new protocol for trustless Web hosting. 
Bitcoin can be used as money due to its properties, but is not money at its core. You can't apply traditional economics to a protocol that has trustless ownership as its foundation.

Look man here is my last reply because at this point you seem to have a over-inflated sense of self. Nothing you say on Reddit will change anything because the BTC Blockchain will outlive Reddit. 
1. Bitcoin is simply the first chain in a technology revolution. 
Watch: 
2. Future websites will be hosted on these blockchains as they have a near 100% uptime due to their "hosting" structure. 
See: 
3. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations do not matter for us in stable nations. Those who come from corrupt countries understand the need for a system purely based on distrust.
You want stable money? Go invest in a Mutual Fund as really everyone should. 
Do you want to speak to someone on the other side of the planet without your government standing in the middle? Buy some Ether and post your manifesto on a chain that should last for another thousand years. 
Bitcoin doesn't need your permission and that's the point. You just sound jealous that someone made a bunch of money off of a new tech that you don't understand. 
Unstoppable code is the goal.  means nothing. Good tech will spread with or without a good marketing team.

No you didn't.

Wut.... I'm making a point that blanket statements about hacks mean nothing. Anyone with any sense of the word clearly define the type of "hack" they are talking about.
If someone gets into your computer and steals your keys then it is your computer that has been hacked, not Bitcoin.
If someone gets into your bank account, then it is the bank that has been hacked, not the money.
Specificity matters in these types of conversations. If you are going to tell me "potato, potato" then you are only discrediting yourself in technical conversation.

Sorry my man but you have a lot of research ahead of you.
I'm looking to do streaming information sessions if you would like me to add you to my mailing list. If you are actually interested.
@_date: 2019-09-21 14:19:49
Uh no. Just like asking if a place accepts mastercard I will always ask places if they accept bitcoin.
Takes 2 seconds, and doesn't hurt anyone.
@_date: 2019-09-21 07:01:56
It's all about rare numbers. Gold is a rare number, making it a good physical analogy to bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-06 16:44:23
So yes you are lying to yourself. You may love the tech first, but you don't seem to understand why you love the tech. If you are trying to squeeze more value from our systems, you are in it for te money.
@_date: 2019-09-06 16:58:16
I'm sure you are an educated individual. Never said you were dumb, just that you don't understand your motives.
If you were to consistanly lose money in crypto till the day you die.... Would you still support it? Assume all the same properties, except treat it like a guaranteed money sink. You wouldn't even touch it. None of us would.
You are not being honest with yourself. A part of Satoshi's game is built on personal dishonesty.
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:30:22
Because we still have massive amounts of people who dont know what they are holding.
The market needs to purge more before big gains. Too many get rich quick people
@_date: 2019-09-02 15:40:50
Doesn't seem like it.

Game theory my dude. If you had invested in CSGO weapon skins you would of had a better store of value than the USD. 
:) if you have any bitcoin I'll gladly take it off your hands for cash.
@_date: 2019-09-23 00:33:05
Have you ever witnessed a conversation where one person has pointed out a flaw in the way the person lays out their arguments, and the other person is completely unawair?
The unawair person will keep spouting what they think are facts, not realizing that the other person fully understands their position and has made an attempt to highlight the internal flaw in the way the argument has been laid out.
You are so blissfully unawair of your poor personal internal bias that you keep throwing external facts at me as if I have not been through much of the same literature and been convinced otherwise. There are personal flaws in the way you "argue" that no matter the topic stop you from understanding the points that the other is trying to make.
It's painful to converse with someone who lacks self awareness.
@_date: 2019-09-21 16:24:16
Bitcoin is 3 things.
The Protocol - the underlying decentral processing system
The Platform - A way to verify communication. A built in single-asset exchange that runs 247
The Value - this is the part that works as money, with a monitary policy that is more consistant than the fed. This is what people buy. This is bitcoin's stock, asset, and gas.
Imagine if you could exchange amazon stock at any time anywhere with anyone. Might be used as a better form of money if the infrastructure is there.
@_date: 2019-09-08 04:06:46
I don't have it on hand, but look up 3blue1brown what is a blockchain. It really helped me.
@_date: 2019-09-20 22:06:25
Yall.... My dude this is a subreddit with thousands of people.
@_date: 2019-09-21 18:26:55
That's not what I asked. You came off as a reasonable person until that point.
I'm not asking about what you think it is, I'm asking what happens if you are wrong. If you can't even entertain the possibility of you being wrong then you are not a reasonable person.
If I am am wrong I lose my money and go back to despising fiat while waiting for a better solution.
If you are wrong... You are not wrong no matter what. OK bud.
@_date: 2019-09-22 02:05:57
Because back in the day it was worth nothing.
@_date: 2019-09-08 04:32:06
When it dropped like 5% yesterday I saw an article about "the recent crash". We have millions of people coming on board who are not used to 10% changes a day.
Let them eat cake.
@_date: 2019-09-21 16:50:17
I'm just glad you are spending the time disproving it. Cryptography only works when people attack the protocol with full force. If the protocol survives the attack, then it's a working protocol.
If you manage to disprove the whole thing then it's better for everyone. Repeated attacks on protocols is what allowed you to angrily mock users on this subreddit.
Freedom of choice is the most important thing.
@_date: 2019-09-02 17:24:04
On a public site. So cute.
@_date: 2019-09-21 15:19:48
Welcome to the rabbit hole my friend. You just articulated why people buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-21 15:40:12
So yes you have cheap bitcoin for me to throw my money away at?
@_date: 2019-09-21 14:55:02
It has the same value as cash.
@_date: 2019-09-21 14:42:56
@_date: 2019-09-02 17:05:57


That sentence is.... wut. Its similar to: "So is the wheel the advantage the car has over traditional transportation"
Blockchain is a method of information confirmation. Yes, it is a part of crypto, no it is not the sole reason.
@_date: 2019-09-21 18:02:09
And what happens if it really is a world currency? On the off chance that people here are correct, OR if it isn't bitcoin that there is another world internet currency. 
 I really apretiate the time you take to respond. Not trolling, just curious.
@_date: 2019-09-23 02:48:32
Imma call up satoshi and tell him to stop printing bitcoin. Thanks Internet person for saving my savings.
@_date: 2019-09-05 20:34:28
If your not here for the money you are lying to yourself.
The system wouldn't work it if wasn't about the money. Satoshi found and exploited the greatest growth motivator, greed.
@_date: 2019-09-21 18:30:51
That's not what I asked.
@_date: 2019-09-21 16:54:30
I'm just glad you are here

Sort of. You are getting close.

@_date: 2019-05-17 23:23:12
Exactly. Also wrapping BTC in faster blockchains is a perfectly acceptable solution.
@_date: 2019-05-03 00:06:21
Of course it can be changed with consensus. Anything can be, but the more people involved the harder it is to change. We are at a point in time where change is near impossible.

How do you not know what hash rate is... While calling eth trash.
@_date: 2019-05-13 20:09:48
It's not a token of value, it's a decentralized  computer.
@_date: 2019-05-13 19:40:25
Reading comprehension seems to be lacking in the anti-eth community.
@_date: 2019-05-17 14:12:11
Hopefully you learn from this that law enforcement people are simply chess pieces for society, and not experts on everything that they like to claim.
I have rarely met someone that enforced laws who was humble enough to say "I don't know". Bitcoin exists because law enforcement is ignorant.

Do we ask goldsmiths of the 1600s if it is possible to have their gold moved between countries in the air?
@_date: 2019-05-02 18:49:14
It's not that we shouldn't, it's that we can't. The code is too set in stone. BTC has to be wrapped and traded on other chains.
@_date: 2019-05-17 23:16:52
From what I know... You seem to have a poor understanding of how TX fees work. Your questions aren't questions, they are "got ya" lines.
Scalability is a problem, but if you were actually concerned about any of your points a few mins of googleing would make you delete your comment.

Its not my job to retype the whitepaper. Every use case for eth has been explored by others who are much smarter than I.
Eth will continue to exist in a space that is different from BTC as it is not made to compete with BTC.
@_date: 2019-05-02 16:43:04
Bitcoin is only valuable in a historical context. It is the first, so therefor the most historically significant. It is not the best, but is as important to our society as Roman roads.

Yea it seems useless for small transactions if thats what I am getting charged. Guy below talks about Electrum.... any other ways I can avoid getting dinged so hard?
