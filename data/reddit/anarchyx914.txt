I'm digging this. As a new miner, please forgive my stupid question. If we are submitting the private key of our wallet to you (or even if you are you generating a new wallet private key) doesn't that present a security liability for the customer? You would know my private key and be able to withdraw my funds at anytime.
This is how the "novice" miner in me sees it, I would love an explanation if I am wrong :)

I have spent over $10,000 with GAW myself, and I can tell you it has been a bumpy road with them.
On their hosting platform I had constant problems with underperforming miners and inconsistent uptime. Miners would go down for days on end, and support tickets took forever to answer. It was quite a nightmare.
Once my miner was taken care of, I can honestly tell you that GAW took care of me in excess with compensation. They credited me nearly 50% of my purchase back, allowed me to keep all of the mined earnings as well as double hash LTC promo payouts, even gave me a free miner or two during the process.
I also struggle with the Hashlet/Zenpool concept. I think its all vaporware if you ask me. I recently converted all of my Power Hungry Zeus hardware to hashlets though, because I never want to take delivery and / or have to host the stuff myself. I am very happy with the hashlets. They are rock solid and on Zenpool my payout is almost 50% better than nicehash. I don't know how they are doing it, but I am getting good BTC payouts, and I have already more than ROI'd the gear, and right now it still has 8 months of hosting for free on it.
Also, with the "ZenPoints" system they have its quite awesome. I keep about 3-4 BTC in the Zencloud account and earn about 750k satoshi interest every day, which I can use to purchase more miners for free just for storing a little btc with them.
For me GAW has gone far beyond their own scope of support and gone out of the way to compensate me for my hardships, for this they have earned my future business. While I don't understand the ZenPool/Hashlet  structure, it is quite profitable for the miner and the Zenpoint system allows you to basically run Hashlets at little to no maintenance cost.
I think you trying to compare GAW to BFL is a terrible idea. BFL has never gone out of their way to compensate me for delays in shipment, downtime, shitty performance, etc.
If you are a GAW customer and have beef, take it up with Josh. He's a very understanding and caring person and he and his staff are always willing to go the extra mile to take care of the customer.
Haters gonna hate.

People that make altcoins want Bitcointalk senior accounts and higher to give "legitimacy" to their scamcoins
