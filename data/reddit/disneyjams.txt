While losing only 4.6% is really impressive, I am actually surprised that the average gains aren't more for the year 2017. 1477% is worse than buying btc at the start of 2017 and selling after a 25% dip from ATH.

Where are you trading at that has commisions that high???? Tips on trading: Go to binance for reasonable fees. Don't trade btc but trade alts for short time frames(&lt;5 min). Aim 1% no need to aim any higher. Get really good at understanding the orderbook.

From the replies you gave, I'd really advise against you investing in a risky asset like this before you learn more about how a market works since you seem clueless. Especially if 5k is serious money for you.

I agree with you that in equities TA is useless since there are ways to come up with a subjective fair value on stocks and most of the trading is based on these valuations. However, in a completely speculative market like crypto, there is no way to value what bitcoin or any coin should trade at, thus makin TA the only analysis you can do for shorter time frame trades. If you know how to do TA on these markets you can make a lot of money.
source: I trade only based on TA and I'm up 7x on my trading capital in the last 30 days. (only long positions and have over 1000 trades)

what? till the SEC meeting, news were incredibly bearish on crypto.

sounds like you don't need no advisor then, got it all figured it out

Yeah I am doing something similar. I was just trying to say that you don't have to be a genius to get huge percentage returns with small amounts. Same strategies don't work with larger amounts.

That means you know that the price is going down before it goes down, which should easily make you a millionaire in a week. Just go margin trading with 100x if you know it's gonna go down.

try to do the same with 300+ million dollars while minimizing risk then talk please.

what if it goes down to 7.5 after you invest? by doing that you'll be missing all the upside, since prices fluctuate in the short term and even though btc would eventually go from 8k to 10k it will probably hit 8.4k correct to 8.3(forcing you to sell) and and then go up to 10k.

Binance in my opinion only place that has enough volume on alts for scalping. Fees are 0.05% for each trade(currently 0.015% till february 26). Tho keep in mind the volume on alts dropped significantly compared to a month ago which makes entering/exiting trades much harder. I trade btc/alt pairings, not enough volume on eth or bnb pairings.
