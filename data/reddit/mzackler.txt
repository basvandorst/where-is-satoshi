So you want Bitcoin to be fiat money?

Um, what?

Different blockchain innovations. Not the coin itself but the ledger behind it.

Any sizable organization that wants to grow would have those issues. Silicon Valley barely touches on it, but it's an example of something similar that could be worrisome. If bitcoin is successful, someone somewhere will be building on the infrastructure and make some money doing it. They will be the one sued for royalties.

1) Speculation and trading are extremely useful for a fledgling currency. They provide liquidity. 
2) Most people are not going to be able to provide innovation any community. You could talk about the 1/9/99 rule, but just look at the world in general? What percent of the world holds patents?
3) What would serious about bitcoin look like you to you? Many people **have** dedicated their lives to it, even more have dedicated many hours or years.
4) NOBODY is countering banks from coming in and ruining everything great about it
What exactly would this look like?

Doesn't everything patentable fall into this category? Are any patents ok iyo?

Well it's for consulting companies. Im ignoring all this because I've never dealt with the kind of company mentioned here but let's sat you choose a big 4 company like PWC. If they bill you $210 an hour for their analyst, $70 is probably his per hour, $70 goes into his future training, his benefits, any expenses not also billed to the client.
$70 goes to the ownership. For a partnership it is complicated but think of a stock ownership, since it doesn't really matter. But basically whoever owns the company.
@_date: 2014-11-21 23:42:30
That's not doable for the long run, also you'd still have a have a gap from right before the halving to right after.

Why would the price go down at the halving? 
@_date: 2014-10-27 20:11:08
Meh, this got addressed like 5 other times in this thread but I got a few minutes.


It's 6% return on paid in capital.




It depends on the year. In 2012 it gave 88.4 billion to the treasury and if I remember correctly a little over 1 billion to banks. Clearly not true. 
@_date: 2014-11-22 05:43:12
There is a decreased marginal BTC being added to the market, there is not a decrease in BTC.
If there are 10 million bitcoins before the halving valued at $300 each, after the halving there are still 10 million bitcoins valued at $300 each. It just affects the reward.
50\*300 = $15,000.  
25*300 = $7,500.

First, economists definitely discuss the tenets of their positions. It's not like it's just one group of people who completely ignore everyone else.
Second, many people for many years across the field of economics talked about the housing crisis in advance. 
But the bigger point. Everyone here likes to talk about the rich elites who control our banking system. You know who is able to save? The rich. You know who benefits from a deflationary currency? The rich. Deflation is terrible for the poor. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 20:58:25
Nowhere near to the extent of bitcoin. That's not a question, it's a statistical fact. 
Um what exactly do you mean by change the ecosystem for Wall Street? And this was my point about an increased price. Increased price makes it so you cannot manipulate it like you can with litecoin. Also Wall Street has a lot more regulation on this type of stuff than the pretty much lack of regulation seen currently for bitcoin markets. 
And I never saw that everyone attitude. Even when i first was part of the IRC talks years ago, people seemed open to the notion. I think a lot of people now are just get rich quick mindset, and adoption is a great way to do that.

The federal government doesn't make obscenity laws. Thus, you can make the address (especially since there is no national definition of obscenity and no location of a bitcoin address). However they can and clearly do have policies in place to not sell to such addresses. What the actual meaning of that policy is could be debated in court, but since we only are dealing with a hypothetical, no they cannot stop you from creating such an address legally but yes they can refuse to sell to you. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 11:33:41
So party A owns bitcoin
Party B pays party A to sell their bitcoin and promises to repay later
Party C is looking for bitcoin. Before there was only Party D, E and F selling. Now there is a fourth seller Party B. Repeat with a lot more companies.
Now the idea about companies only short this driving down the price isn’t a very good one but the idea that shorting drives down the price is generally true. 
Another simpler way to think about it is you buying the stock. Didn’t someone have to sell it to you? Yes, but more buyers = drives up the price.

I can make a fiat currency that is not inflationary. What's stopping me? Create fiat currency with only 10,000 units. I will never produce any more. The currency is not inflationary. 


Can you explain how this is a benefit of inflation? Investment in innovation and technology generally are good for society, sure, is your argument that inflation forces people to invest?


You really should look into the details of that case. It's been completely misappropriated. 
Your overall argument seems to be that people are overincentivized to spend by inflation.
1. Can you provide evidence that low levels of inflation encourage spending now? It's not like we have out of control inflation.  
2. This is counteracted by the return on investments. If I can expect a sizable return on my money I would save and would always be thinking about it in the same way. The reverse causes issues. I can go invest in TIPS. In a deflationary economy no one has the incentive to create the deflationary version of TIPS. 
Other issues:
Deflationary economies hurt poor people. Debtors are benefited by inflation since the real value of their debt decreases over time (it's why the US debt is actually not as big of a problem as it could be). Poor people are often the debtors. 
Wage and price decreases are often stickier than their reverse. It makes for messy situations especially in the labor market (you want me to take less money home each year?).
Interest rates can't fall below 0. Thus a 2% deflation rate means that the real interest rate has a base of 2%. 
@_date: 2014-11-22 03:26:06
Er, ok then. So what net benefits of deflation do you see?
Also keep in mind that a fiat currency can be both inflationary and deflationary while bitcoin can only be deflationary as a central currency. Thus if you want to argue we should sometimes have inflation, it seems that bitcoin is problematic as a currency.
@_date: 2014-12-20 20:46:18
1) The argument is he helped people harm someone. I'm guessing you also find the underlying crime to be victimless but if we accept (and from the perspective of the judge you kind of have to) that the buying/selling of drugs is problematic than we should attempt to stop the facilitation of it.
2) You're just making it worse though. Yes, that happens. But now people without that incentive also would launder. 
3) ok so we only punish based on incentive? So if I was paid $100k to murder someone, my only incentive is profit. Should I thus only be fined for committing murder? Also it's ridiculously hard to follow that standard and will lead to arbitrary decisions imo.
@_date: 2014-04-11 02:12:48


If feasible you should have that in most markets (given there aren't flash crashes). And adjust them given certain things happening.


I agree. I would be more than willing to discuss these distinctions, however it was an analogy. The point was you don't inherently get out of something due to the lack of a historical return. If you still have strong belief in future return, you should stay in.
@_date: 2014-01-03 05:21:28
First of all there are those rules. Wall Street can't just move in without those rules in place no matter what people think of Wall Street.
Second, it will only help the value, stability, reach etc. of bitcoin.
Third, this is what the people who created bitcoin wanted. They wanted the free market. Even though idealists live in a bubble it's bitcoin meets the real world. Good, bad, indifferent it's not only inevitable it ought to happen.

A few things:
1) Why is an eye for an eye optimal policy? Under very few theories of justice does it even seem to come close.
2) So basically if I have no money and start laundering money society can't do anything to me if I get caught?
3) Let's say I sold drugs out of a greed to make money. They should uh fine me drugs?

Where exactly do you get the 94% owned by the government part? 6% dividend isn't 6% of the profits.
@_date: 2014-11-22 07:36:03


I'm not really sure what this means but let's accept it. The solution wouldn't then be that deflation is now a good alternative?


That's not a problem of an inflationary currency (also the article's title isn't supported by the article) that's a problem of politics.


First the gold standard wasn't necessarily deflationary (in fact it wasn't during that time period) but furthermore this is definitely correlation without causation. 


Honestly have never heard anyone say that before. I mean, asset pricing models literally have a built in lack of liquidity premium. You as someone who needs to borrow pays money for lack of liquidity. You pay money for bad things (all of those risks). Basic pricing models suggest liquidity = good. 


Traders do well in volatility. The people are worse off because people have difficulty reacting to price shocks. The productive sector likes stable prices. If people did well they did it in spite of volatility not because of it. 


Are we talking about the Fed specifically? These talking points are really vague, I've heard them before but usually they at least reference something. First, for most of the Fed's history we have had a gold standard. Second, economics sucks in that you can't do simulated research but I'm not sure where you are finding evidence of more/worse (we care about the severity too) crises under the Fed. Can you source this/clarify your points namely are we specifically talking about the Fed and if so are we talking about post the gold standard fed?
@_date: 2014-01-04 20:25:02
The bailout you're mentioning was useful but didn't stop it from going to near 0. 
And I would argue stopping Wall Street from being a part is infeasible, I'm not sure how it could become a tool for "taking our money", many people who follow bitcoin wanted Wall Street to care for a while, Wall Street caring begets regulation, and most founders of bitcoin were extremely libertarian. As libertarians you would be against stopping Wall Street from using your tool.
@_date: 2014-01-03 19:08:08
It's inherent in its deflationary nature. If it doesn't stay as an investment vehicle it means it isn't adopted. So by your definition it auto fails.
I disagree Wall Street adds to this likelihood but it's not a good argument so ill just say fair enough. I also think you shouldn't treat Wall Street as a uniform body.
@_date: 2014-11-22 06:47:31


I mean this just isn't true. Sure poor people often don't have the best spending habits, but lack of education = lack of quality job = poor is more common than oh they just spent too much.


Sure. But poor people don't have this option. You think poor people like being in the debt they are in? Even in our current state there are huge incentives such as the 10+% interest on those loans. 


This is less so than in a deflationary economy. I'd really like to see what FED people say that inflationary economies increase the wealth gap faster, do you have a link handy?


Lol what? There were plenty of problems with the gold standard. It was much harder to set inflation targets, you had liquidity issues, there was always the worry that someone would find a lot of gold and that would just screw up everything (California in 1848 did that a bit), and there were issues of discount rates between different countries. That had a few issues including arbitragers making money (the idea being that there was a finite amount of real value so any money given to arbitrage is taken from the "productive sector"). I could go on, but to say there was no issue at all with the gold standard is problematic. 


Maybe some other time. There are better forums for it though such as or some non-reddit forums.
@_date: 2014-06-02 17:36:03
The physical dollar supply is a little over 1 trillion. Is that what you mean?
And then what transfers count? A super simplistic approach would be to use GDP (think income method as to why) + maybe you would want to include a few trillion of foreign transactions. If you're including all stock transfers and stuff it's enormous. But most of those transfers never actually use real dollars. 
So maybe about 20x currency value per year.
No matter what estimate you use bitcoin is nowhere near there.

It's a very common idea discussed often in the business world in cases - how could different companies miss the opportunity to innovate a market? Because they were used to doing it one way for so long. Why do we use a qwerty keyboard? Because that's inertia. Why do we hate when Microsoft Excel makes a 'more efficient' change? Inertia.

To quote ["The Fed \[is\]...required to turn over essentially all its profits to the Treasury"]( It's required by law to turn all that realized gains over (that's why it's going to be fun when it starts having lots of realized losses). 
EDIT: Note, this an internal policy of the Fed, not a law in the current status quo. I actually don't like the language there after rereading, [this
]( covers it better. The choice currently though is the Fed's not the Treasury which address the profit demanded by the treasury thing.
And I know it's less than 6% of the profits. Because banks get 6% of their PAID IN CAPITAL, not 6% of the profits. My point is that simple.


Er, I hope you realize that I'm not arguing it's not public. However you are reading that entirely backwards. It is on demand of the person who has a federal reserve note, not the treasury. If a bank has a fed IOU, then they can redeem it for money at the treasury (functionally no one does that anymore).


It depends what we are arguing. I think I'm misunderstanding where our differences lie, but it's still addressed a [few]( times. When I get home I can find you the places if you want.

The marginal return from mining still halves. 
Let's say 10,000 machines can mine profitably (in terms of marginal cost) if the return is 50 bitcoins and 10,000 machines are working.
There will be some number less than that that can mine profitably if the return is only 25 bitcoins. Some miners will drop out so the expected return will not be half of the first number but it will still be less. To have no one drop out is a possible scenario but very unlikely.

Even if there was no fractional reserve banking in the future, that wouldn't justify your claim.

It looks like it has twice since 2011. The issue with a ponzi scheme with such high interest rates is both not getting too few people in (you need 40% extra people a month), but you also can't have too many people in. With 40% interest rates, assuming you add the minimum, you need 7.5 at the end of the year for every 1 in initially in their equivalent of a down line. And that assumes people are pulling out the interest. It actually becomes a bigger problem if everyone leaves their money in.
@_date: 2015-11-01 13:24:26

1) what society has no form of debt?
2) inflation is a tax on the rich, not the poor. If I owe $100 and now dollars are half as valuable as before I now owe the equivalent of 50 old dollars. If I have $1000 under my mattress and dollars are worth half as much I only have 500 old dollars

In Bitcoin or in general?
1) only allow margins of certain amounts and you can hedge with derivatives. So if they are on margin of 4 stocks for every 1 they can afford, you only need to worry about a 25% change. But out of the market puts. You can also lend sales to sell short etc.

*How currencies work?
*How investing works?
*How international trade works?
*More about economic theories?

So, if only like 1% of the gold that's expected to be there actually is there, why would some big firm not spend 60 billion and short squeeze the hell out of everyone else?
They would 
A) get all the world's gold
B) get a hell of a lot of fiat
And in theory, you don't even need to actually buy all of the gold. Just a large portion, let others follow you.
Worst comes to worst, they deliver to you, and now that the rest of the world has no gold, the price will skyrocket as you slowly sell.
It's a win-win.

We can't just fiat everyone some stored value of wealth. 
Also when we give everyone those things they tend to sell them because people aren't educated on these things or are desperate. In Russia they gave everyone stocks in the big oil companies and things and people just bought all the shares and became billionaires.
Basically, your hypothetical of we all just have wealth doesn't work.
Your fathers pension doesn't have to do with debt. I'm not sure the situation but it's impossible from you to build a sufficiently strong link story from there all the way to debt is bad. I could literally answer it with let him take his money out... If another solution works, your claim doesnt. You also still mandate you putting your bitcoins you earn a work in a 401k. So it's non unique.
Your second one is too vague to address
On the legally mandated insurance companies. Cool. I'm not sure why we can't mandate that with a bitcoin based world. That's non unique. Also that's how businesses often work. If you think it is an issue it's an incentives issue not a currency issue so again your argument falls flat.

Cool... so hold until the actual point of delivery. Your entire analysis is missing an idea that on the surface seems complicated but underneath isn't at all.
If JP Morgan only has enough gold for 1,000 contracts.  You buy 10,000 contracts worth of gold. I don't care how much they destroy the price in the mean time by just unloading more shorts. Nothing else that happens matters. They must deliver the 10,000 contracts. This is where the short squeeze takes action.


That's your issue. They don't deliver for E-minis without substantial fees. 
You want something like [this] ( to force physical delivery.

In the short term it could definitely drive it down.
Think about what happens if the government releases a shit ton of coins. Price goes down, ALOT. 
If this leads to fears that this could happen in the future it could drive price down.
Also, it could cause fear for drug dealers who might stop using it, killing a portion of the market.
I can think of a few other reasons.
You're relatively right in that in the long term it really can't be harmful, unless in the short term they do significant enough damage to make people feel the currency is unviable.

You could say the same about your personal shopper. And it really depends.
For most people in the modern world I agree that an in person broker is superfluous. For when you have many millions? Not so much.

A very small percentage. Most of it is in some form of investment. The velocity of money is about two for usd, no idea for bitcoins. But it's not a percentage concern for most people.
The thing is, if enough people wanted to spend it, the hope is more stores and places would offer it as a payment option, more people would hear about it etc. eventually spurs investment etc, hopefully a snowball effect to widespread use

You're conflating two ideas here. What is good for the economy is not necessarily what makes a currency a good currency. Inflation isn't only the answer then but it's a much more complicated discussion. My point is that rapid deflation isn't good for a currency either (rapid inflation is bad).

See they can be, but commodities trading doesn't actually deliver anymore. They almost exclusively trade in futures, not forwards.

*Big payments of some kind (quantitative easing, budgets)
*Illegal activity (drug deals, insider trading)
*New status (countries adopting, reserve status, IMF deals, restructuring, new place trading it)
Nobody really reports in bitcoins/there can't be quant easing, so I guess you can see some charity in bitcoin.
Really the only news you can see then is expansion such as options, forex, stock market, or adoption as "good news", and even then it's easily overshadowed since that's kinda boring

Couldn't this become the perception with bitcoin?


There are, but it's relatively underdeveloped. As it gains more prominence and regulation/trust more and more markets will allow these. There are already a few VCs I know of actually that are planning to do this, the problem is many of them are realizing creating exchanges is a ton of money and not the greatest return, especially due to the counterparty risk here.


I disagree, but that's fair. 


Basically, it can't keep inflating forever as a result of this. In real terms, bitcoin will eventually have to increase at or below the real change in world GDP.
It was an argument used with houses a lot, that they could not always grow with increases that much greater than everything else. Eventually you run out of buyers. I could probably find some better writers on the subject than myself, but the basic premise is that nothing can grow faster than growth in output indefinitely by definition.

A few questions:
Do you believe that those people are living without banks out of choice or out of lack of access?
Is borrowing from a friend or your community considered debt?
Do you believe that microloans are beneficial?
It depends on your definition of debt to provide evidence, but I will say two things:
1) Many people do not have "debt" in the conventional sense based on a lack of access. Living on under $5 a day they don't have the option to get loans. It's not that they don't want them. When they do get loans, the interest rates are often 30% or higher due to the lack of access and competition. And people fight over those loans. 
2) Banked doesn't mean loans. People can have other services with banks such as just investing through them in CDs and the like.

Not sure if this is just me but a few things here:
1) I imagine all large mining pool owners in the future will have some identifying features. It seems it would be relatively trivial for the United States Federal Government to put significant pressure on them to comply with current US laws.
2) It follows that most of the problem here was the US law. Therefore IF bitcoin can be an advantage here, it's due to something being illegal.
3) I imagine an escrow company would need to be relatively well known to be trusted which means you could definitely lean on them.

How do you explain the trillions in gold? Also basic derivatives (I know libertarians for some reason hate these) can be made to help with this.


Wouldn't that stabilize with better financial markets and derivatives as well as widespread adoption, an increase in market cap etc?


See, the problem with this argument is that:
1. Bitcoin inflates at higher than real growth in which case you'd hold. Eventually either bitcoin encompasses all wealth in the world. That doesn't seem practical.  
2. Therefore, it seems that bitcoin's stabilization would by necessity require it to only grow at a similar rate as real growth at best.   
3. There is no necessity of it actually destroy current currencies, it can be useful to supplement them.

2) It's not even true based on that. It's if everything was at today's price for bitcoins which is an absurd measure.

On the long depression: It's extremely hard to discuss this on a forum. It requires a ridiculous amount of agreed upon assumptions to start that debate. It's not inherently bad, but it's not a generally good property.


1) Money doesn't have an inherent value. 
2) It can't consistently grow faster than real growth. It's a definitional thing, not a bitcoin is special thing.
3) Do you believe fiat currencies will be replaced with bitcoin?

There's two arguments possible here:
1) easier to manipulate/price to change due to smaller market cap
2) easier to manipulate/price to change due to smaller price per coin
The first one makes sense. The second one doesn't.

The common real world example is with oil. You literally have them all in the same tanks and then sell and buy from each other. Exxon can end up with BP's oil and vice versa without anything moving. Other commodities do it too. It's a common thing. Obviously there is much more recourse if they steal here but yeah.

Market cap would be a better way to compare. Bitcoin at 10k would be more like 100-200b, gold is estimated at probably like 7 trillion now
Palladium has a comparable market cap of this new bitcoin iirc and most people have no idea that even exists afaik. 
But bitcoin would be used for transactions, so imagine it would be known at that point. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 06:38:45
Assuming 0 transaction costs I would disagree with you, but bitcoin is still hard to get so I'll agree. However, if you think about it you can spend $20 in bitcoin and then just buy the $20. They then know you came to their shop because of bitcoin = more likely to continue putting in the effort to accept it.
@_date: 2013-11-04 20:08:57
call it bitcoins in circulation. If bitcoin is to be treated like a currency, that's how it works. Market cap can be used for other things such as economies themselves in various contexts.
However, it's usually not even a good value, you can also use enterprise value which is a usually better measurement.
A market cap for a currency doesn't really make sense though.
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:19:17

That's fairly nonsensical without interpretation.
What is successful? Did the company profit? Or did society benefit? Or did the regulation just work as intended (at least for most practical purposes)? There are probably dozens of other interpretations.
I will answer what I can without an explanation (and help more if you provide it, although I know posts go missed)
1) Self regulation
A. Did it make more profit? Sure you can find cases. Places boycotted for doing x stop doing x and they make $$$ as boycott ends.  
B. Did it benefit society? It's a tough question, and it depends on your definition of society, benefit etc. (See how this question becomes really complicated really fast? It's why books get written on these subjects, chapters are spent defining terms). But the simple answer is very likely. Any type of contract is considered a regulation. You both get what you want out of the contract? It benefited society.  
C. Did it work as intended? I mean yeah, look up things like Six Sigma. Close enough.
2) Regulation from "independent" bodies.
A. Here we have to think of why these are in place. They often lead to more trust in the industry. If it benefited me to not get stuff approved by Underwriter's Laboratory, I wouldn't (assuming rational constraints). Thus from a company perspective it produces more profit.  
B. From a society's perspective these are often put in place due to consumer demand or threat of government action (like the MPAA) which is most likely spearheaded by consumer demand. Again, societal benefit is hard to define, but if people are relatively rational, and in some instance it was spurred either directly or indirectly by societal demand, then it should be beneficial.  
C. Did it work as intended? Motive is hard to judge from industries, but I would argue close enough. The MPAA kept the government from regulating movies and also is alleged to keep other companies out. So did it work for the benefit of those involved? Yes. Did it work close to perfectly? Probably not, but as good as you would get. It was better than the alternative for them.
Again, try your best to give me definitions and I can try to provide a better empirical analysis.
@_date: 2013-11-06 03:34:03
We are just going in circles on the middle part... Currencies aren't meant to appreciate. Sure no currency has failed due to it, that doesn't mean it's good for the currency. It's also impossible to have happen indefinitely (rapid deflation can only grow at the rate of the economy which can't grow rapidly forever). 
Bitcoins can totally be stolen by force, the same way a locked safe can be stolen by force. 
Next you can't have it both ways. Either bitcoin can be used for derivatives or it can't. If it can you can't draw the benefits of financial instruments not being used, if it can't then you can't draw the benefits of it being used. Furthermore, it's not like we would get rid of fiat currency anyways.
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:44:28
So let me get this straight. You ignore the totality of my argument, make an absolute claim and are not able to refute examples that by themselves are sufficient to prove your argument wrong and I'm the one that needs to question my belief system?
You don't leave me with much to work with here, but let's use something called logic.


Oh look now we are at a stalemate. Unfortunately, I can use logic to respond to this concept. 
There's also a basic burden of proof on anyone making a claim to at least discuss their scenario not just use the oft repeated drivel of "oh, it's obvious if only you would look". Guess what, it's not obvious   since 99.9% of people can't "see" it. 
But let's discuss this argument. I made a very basic response because you don't seem to have the ability to make a claim more coherent than we will be without debt thus no one will need to work.
Let's address this:
1) You suggest that 57% of people live without debt. It's not true, but let's just give you it. It logically follows that if living without debt was sufficient to not needing to work, they would not need to work. Instead those people are considered among the poorest on Earth. They live on less than $5 a day.
2) You can't just get rid of the need for work. Things need to happen. We don't have robots yet that can do all the work for us. Therefore at a minimum, someone needs to farm. This is against sufficient to reject all iterations of your claim since if bitcoin can't solve the root problem (can't not won't) and the problem won't solve itself in the mean time, then it follows that that can't be a solution.
I admit to being a little lazy with the formatting of the logical arguments here, but the claim - warrant - impact + link story is clear enough for you to respond to.

Ok, so why would a company not just call then on this and buy all the futures,  to force delivery? 
@_date: 2013-11-06 15:17:40


You can't with futures either. First, most of these bets are within several months so inflation is low. Also many of the worst do it by shorting treasuries to get the capital for these bets.


That can still exist. See JP Morgan bailing out the market. It can happen without a central bank.

What does that even mean? 


I never once say it's necessary. It's useful, not necessary.


Yes, using logic = following a mantra.


Actually none of my argument does. Name one single part of my argument that does. Unless you are just defining bitcoin as this endallbeall.


It's also irrelevant to using logic.


My view on what? On predicting the future? Useful within certain contexts. But you need to back it up with logic, either deductive or inductive.

There are a couple flaws with the logic:
1. New less? sophisticated buyers. Basically old users were willing to wait out swings and news. The new users just got in due to hearing about it. This drove up the price. Lots of unsophisticated users in a market is expected to increase volatility. 
2. If there is a finite dollar cap then it becomes more problematic. Let's say originally there was $1 million chasing bitcoins. Now there are $10 million. If bitcoin went up 10x, you get some people like the guy who spent $27 to dump all their coins. That eats up much of the $10 million really fast.

More bitcoins still = less value. They're going upwards due to the scarcity of them. If I doubled the amount of bitcoins that wouldn't make it go up? Or am I misunderstanding? If you're just arguing a bitcoin will relatively grow in value to a dollar due to its limited quantity, I agree but it really means very little in a positive sense from a macroeconomic perspective.

I was just being lazy, but none of my terms are colloquially wrong.


Here you seem to suggest a ton of demand for bitcoins. Not at the current price, but at some relatively comparable price. I was saying there is not THAT much demand.


I never said there is no demand. And you would be because it could pull all liquidity out of the market destroying the price.


A. The government isn't a superrational actor.  
B. This is just a really shitty false dilemma...  
I mean honestly, what? The government if it bothered could do a ton to harm bitcoin. 


Cool. You actually need to look at the reverse to see if this matters. What is the primary use of bitcoins in terms of actual use. But it's a much longer discussion I don't want to have with you because:


1. Gold futures are good? They help with convenient buying and selling, hedging, etc.   
2. Can you break down how and why the government would manipulate the price of gold?   
3. Eventually there will be. Or at least I hope there will be for bitcoin's sake. Futures and options are good for forex.

Sorry for the late reply. 
The most basic argument is around competition. If I offer a fiat currency, you can still buy gold. I know there are laws against certain gold stuff, but that's irrelevant to the economic arguments either way. As a result, competition results. If my only option is gold there isn't a way to forex hedge. 
It also becomes messy with foreign trade. You get rid of almost all monetary policy when you make it a gold standard. 
It's also entirely arbitrary and based on nothing as well. Gold is basically a fiat currency. So is bitcoin for that matter. If no one wanted gold anymore, wanted bitcoin or US dollars, then they all go to near 0. Gold comes out a little on top for industrial uses/jewelry, but it's not anywhere near the price it is now. 
Gold is also more volatile than the US dollar which makes everyday transactions awkward.

Unless there's a default of some kind that's merely a technicality. They're minimizing counterparty risk.


Don't specifically know, but they can't change the rules midcontract.


There's a lot of stories about that, I wasn't alive but a lot of the issue was they ran out of money. They also physically had delivered what they wanted. GATA is arguing there's only like 1% of the claimed physical gold. That would require in the neighborhood of $60 billion to corner and would still be within the law.


If there is such a disconnect go into the market. Go buy on the market and get physical delivery of a relatively small amount. Not of a derivative, of the actual future on the CME. Then go sell to whoever you think is willing to pay a much higher price. Even if you don't break the banks you have a ton of risk free arbitrage profit.

Yes... you can. It's called a short squeeze. People have done it before and made a ton. You can also lose a ton because you drive up price a lot in the process. 


This is true for you, because you are a lone individual. My question is why doesn't some big institutional investor come along and do this? Delivery fees are specified in the futures contract, so it's not like they could actually do that. What contract were you using/what exchange?
Let's look at another market, oil. Here there are tons of idle speculation by banks who will never take physical delivery. And every month, they close out their bets and don't have to. Now many people argue they aren't good for the market, but that doesn't mean that they can just naked short forever. One of the big oil companies would just call them on that. Why is that not the case in gold where the world's physical supply is physically really small.

Half of those aren't super true for bitcoin but w/e. 
The rising in value isn't something that makes a currency useful as a means of transaction. It's useful for storing value. Many people, including most economists, argue it's actually a negative for a currency because it deincentives you to spend. Think of a situation like Zimbabwe, people spent like crazy due to inflation. Deflation causes the opposite. Severe hoarding at the detriment of society.
