This isn't the reason for the dip.
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:22:40
Have a read through this. I had written off my losses as they were low double digits in BTC, but for your 100BTC, it seems worthwhile following up. I need to have a good read through it myself tonight.
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:18:03
Shit mate that sucks... I had an account on Craptsy and traded there for a while, but luckily I withdrew all my coins before the shit hit the fan there.
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:20:54
Nope, but someone PMed me this. I've set some time aside to have a read through it tonight....
@_date: 2018-01-04 16:01:47
I feel ya. Lost BTC in the Mintpal scam. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:49:11
Correction. Nope, it's the bubble playing out. This is the start of the final capitulation. Bottom is not far away.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:16:54
Phase 1 - take profit if you can.
Phase 2 - buy at support
Phase 3 - sell when the bounce loses momentum
Phase 4 - Go to Phase 2
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:57:51
You're overthinking it. Its completely normal market behavior.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:50:05
Oh, don't worry. I'm watching like a hawk for a good re-entry point.
 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:42:14
Or sell and take profit, then buy back in.
@_date: 2018-09-03 05:04:48
Show your work. WHY is that the most likely scenario?
Or are you just holding bags of XMR that you wanna dump.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:07:23
Sale hasn't finished yet
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:49:22
It's the bubble deflating.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:21:13
Can't wait for the panic selling when the US wakes up
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:07:57
Its heading back down again now. I have my buy orders in sub 10K
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:51:23
Initial investment? 
@_date: 2015-06-28 11:17:35
Most missed the boat, some of those that missed the boat would lie an opportunity to buy in cheaper.
Others have vested interests in products/services that are directly competing with Bitcoin, so it makes good business sense for them to espouse such hatred towards Bitcoin...
@_date: 2018-09-03 05:09:18
CGT works in a similar way in Australia, and I bet a whole bunch of countries. After a year of owning the asset, the CGT rate on that asset is halved.
@_date: 2018-05-30 14:17:29
No, pros take profit.
@_date: 2018-05-31 03:33:40
You're quoting things I did not say.
If you never sell how can you realise a profit? 
The hodl forever approach is not the most profitable, and is usually espoused by people who are holding during a bear market.
@_date: 2018-05-30 14:24:31
BTC or bust. 
ETH is absolutely an Alt.
@_date: 2018-08-19 12:36:49
Aint she a beaut
@_date: 2018-10-20 04:52:47
Same argument for "when its getting to 27K" though
@_date: 2018-10-08 11:18:48
Fuck I miss the early days of SwC. So many fish. Like the proverbial shooting fish in a barrel.
@_date: 2016-11-10 16:04:16
You invalidated your claim by confusing weather with whether :)
@_date: 2018-06-26 10:17:09
Whales. LOL. 
How many fucking times do we have to post a pic of the bubble cycle and how dumb do you fuckheads have to be to keep blaming the current state of the market on whales (China, the boogeyman etc etc etc).
@_date: 2018-06-12 15:23:27
I said capitulation is near, I meant the beginning of the capitulation phase, not necessarily the bottom. 
I agree, I think we're in for a very long bear market. I should have emphasised the "wait"
@_date: 2018-06-14 16:13:29
Selling /= shorting. You can trade without leverage you know...
There are many opportunities to increase your stash if accumulation is your objective. There are also many opportunities to make fiat money too - just depends how much time you have to dedicate to watching the charts.
@_date: 2018-06-12 14:56:10
Capitulation is near. It's just the bubble playing out. Wait, and buy more at the bottom.
@_date: 2018-06-14 15:53:53
This is nothing new. If you were involved since "a long time ago" you would know this.
The spirit is not dead, but posts like yours just add food to the picnic basket that the bears are feasting apon now (and probably for the next couple of years).
You can still make money in a bear market, if you choose to do so.

Slush has always been one of the good guys.
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:00:12
The benefit is in spreading the load. Look up "51% attack"

@_date: 2017-11-04 13:18:05
You sold at the right time imo, well done. Nothing wrong with taking profit.
@_date: 2017-11-06 08:12:21
On paper....
@_date: 2017-11-02 08:11:05
Zoom out.
@_date: 2015-08-07 14:01:07
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:03:09
You don't have any dollars until you sell. Just saying.
Plus, it's pretty much parabolic now, so the real fun's just about to begin. Anyone wanna pick a top?
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:59:00
+1 here as well. Slush was always one of the good guys...
@_date: 2019-01-07 07:32:07
Absolute propaganda
@_date: 2018-02-08 07:29:03
"experts" say
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:50:19
It's literally most alts.
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:12:47
Is that it's not cheap yet by a long shot.
Wait for the sale.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:43:24
Ok Mr Smarty Pants, where's the bottom?
I think it will go under 7K, originally predicted 6K just after the bubble burst.
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:09:45
Zoom out people. If you are looking at the 1D chart and thinking that it's going up from here, you're dreaming.

Should be fun FEW hours yet I think, should also be an interesting time when the US wakes up...
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:07:12
Please explain why it is "amateur hour".
edit: I'm not yanking your chain. I sold out at $1190 yesterday but only because I thought it was overpriced, not because i expected bad news out of China.
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:55:02
check again
@_date: 2013-12-01 13:38:53
How is it any of your business?
@_date: 2013-11-08 11:23:50
FWIW I've successfully withdrawn small amounts of coins (under 10) on multiple occasions these past few weeks. The longest it has taken was a day and a half.
@_date: 2013-12-01 11:28:58
I've used SpendBitcoins and Coinjar, and prefer the latter due to lower fees. Never had any issues with either party. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:55:15
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:58:55
So... OP didnt sell in time?
