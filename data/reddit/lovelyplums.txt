When you say stuff like "miss the train?" it just confirms that your primary interest for the success of BTC is your own personal profit seeking rather than the realisation of the purported societal benefits that some say crypto could have.

Remind me how Austrian ideas like the Gold Standard worked out?

I am actually quite intrigued in heterodox schools of economic thought and am no fan of neoclassical. But Austrian doesnt stand up empirically. In fact it basically rejects empirics.
I would hazard a guess that you would support any school of economic thought that supported your maximalist beliefs in crypto. Thats not intelligence. Its confirmation bias.
Central banking has been doing pretty well the last 100 years. Central banks didnt cause the crisis FYI. Name me one problem that stems directly from the model of central banking. and dont say inflation because you and I both know that until you started holding crypto, you didnt give a damn about inflation.

Where I live in the UK its very easy to get a savings account that gives a higher interest rate than the rate of inflation. Everything else gets spent on consumption on a month to month basis. Inflation is not a problem unless you live in argentina or venezuela.

You dont understand inflation

"Check out this niche school of heterodox thinking that holds virtually zero weight in todays society".
Ehm no, I dont think I will. You think that what you've seen on some maximalist crypto blog is a good substitute for four years of university education which says it all about many in the crypto space.
I wish people would just accept that theyre holding cryptos for the possibility of getting stinking rich and very little else. I made a nice little bit of bank myself.

about 50% of people consume all their disposable income on a month to month basis. The other half saves their money, which as I say can be done via readily accessible savings accounts with a rate of interest higher than the rate of inflation.

Lol almost believable until you said you had been concerned about inflation since highschool. Good try.

I have an Honours Degree in Economics.
You have 0.0012 bitcoin.
Literally look in any entry level economics textbook to find out why your comment, and this post, do not make sense.
Unless you keep all your savings in cash and your employer doesnt increase your wages periodically in line with inflation then the fed is not silently taxing you.
PS never take out a private loan if you think deflation is a good thing.
