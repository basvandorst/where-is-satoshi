I completely agree that demand for block space decreased but the link you provided is unrelated to your argument. It just shows that the average transaction is larger than before.
@_date: 2018-01-21 11:19:11
If the number of confirmed transactions went down but the blocks are still the same size then that means the average transaction must be larger in size. 
This would actually suggest transaction batching is happening.

How would one mine "invalid" blocks? And where do you even quote that from?
The longest chain is the only relevant and valid chain as stated by the whitepaper (go read it).
@_date: 2015-12-03 12:54:22
Abstract from the [bitcoin whitepaper](
A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online
payments to be sent **directly from one party to another without going through a
financial institution.** Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main
benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending.
We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network.
The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of
hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing
the proof-of-work. **The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of
events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As
long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to
attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers.** The
network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort
basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest
proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.

Let's say we have a hardfork with two contending chains, chain A and chain B.
The majority of the exchanges, vendors, people only value and deal in coins from chain A, but they do not have a majority of hashing power because most of the power is supporting chain B.
This is important: even though the hashing power of chain B does not support chain A, they can still mine there and create blocks. Because they do not support chain A they don't use their hashing power to support the network but rather to attack it, they can create blocks in chain A that are completely worthless to the users of chain A (by mining empty blocks, undoing mined blocks by other miners, etc..).
So effectively chain A does not contain any blocks that are useful to the supporters of chain A.
Because the miners can effectively "destroy" (bombard it to death so to say) chain A by hashing power, chain A will just stop being used *in practice*. Sure chain A will still exist, but does it count as "surviving"?
Meanwhile, chain B will still be useful, because miners that support chain A cannot do harm to chain B because they lack hashing power. Therefore, people will ultimately switch over to chain B again once they understand chain B is more secure and useful to them.
Maybe read my previous post again to fully understand how it is impossible to have two competing chains *in practice*.

I very much appreciate your addition; exchanging perspectives in a civilized manner is an important step in finding common ground. 
The bitcoin community has become so polarized as of late that I sometimes wonder if we are collectively still able to listen to each other without preconceptions about eachothers intentions. Everybody is so distrustful, it's almost like the age old Republican vs Democrat debate. 
Anyway, I'm off to bed, thanks for your thoughts :)
@_date: 2015-12-03 20:32:40
There is nothing to be had in the eye of the beholder because the 99% of hashing power would just completely destroy the 1% power chain by any number of attacks of which there are many of.
The only way the 1% chain could survive is by fundamentally changing how that chain works; changing the proof of work algo, whitelisting miners or other centralized measures.
You just cannot have two chains with the same proof of work that are competing, the one with more hashing power will always win. This is the exact property of bitcoin that makes it so awesome, you can't fuck with it with a workaround. It works exactly like it was designed.
All this blocksize/scaling talk has made people forget how this stuff actually works; you can't just convince a bunch of people and "ignore" the hashing power. Thank god we can't..
@_date: 2015-12-03 21:11:10
You're the third person to misunderstand what I'm saying but I don't blame you since it was caused by my brevity (as explained in my other posts).
Obviously you can create a chain with invalid blocks that is longer than any other chain, this is trivial to do. You just can't do anything with the chain because there isn't a node that will accept the blocks, or a miner that will build on it. Hence my question should be "how would one mine invalid blocks and have them propagate through the network" (read my responses to others that came up with examples of invalid blocks/chains). And with network I mean the current bitcoin network that we all trust (sorry to be so explicit, don't want to cause more misunderstandings).
If you read the [chain of posts]( that lead to my post you will hopefully understand better where I'm coming from.
My point is this: in case there is a hardfork and two chains come out of it, you can't say there is one chain with "invalid" blocks simply because you choose to value the other chain more because it has different properties. And it is really theoretical anyway, because two competing bitcoin chains cannot coexist at the same time. The one with the most hashing power will most likely destroy the other chain by attacking it with it's hashing power as I explained [here](
This is why I say "The longest chain is the only relevant and valid chain as stated by the whitepaper (go read it).".
And the "go read it" is uncalled for. I apologize, I just had the longest, most intense working day of my life (21 hours straight on 3 hours of sleep).
Hope this clears things up.
@_date: 2015-12-03 18:04:41
You would be mining on a different chain with different rules. Noone would recognize your chain as one with any relevance. 
Obviously the longest chain is only valid if you follow the same rules. This is what proof of work is all about. I'm surprised I had to explain this since this is at the core of how bitcoin works. 
@_date: 2015-12-09 20:22:06
I like the idea for sure, though I think building such a tool is probably even harder than the problem you're trying to solve. 
There isn't really a substitute for creative brilliance I think, although we might come close with all these crazy evolutionary algorithms and machine learning projects that are happening nowadays. (after they reach return on investment by using them for marketing and advertising purposes of course.. ;))
@_date: 2015-12-03 18:49:20
Actually you didn't answer my question, my question was "how can miners with the majority of hashing power mine invalid blocks". Your answer does not include the majority of hashing power. Read the conversation carefully. 
Satoshi explicitly defines the chain with most hashing power as the "real" chain. So my question still stands, how can this chain be invalid? 
Sorry for the comment about me having to explain how bitcoin works. It was uncalled for. 
@_date: 2015-12-03 18:26:17
Well, the economic majority would never follow that chain and miners know this so they would never attempt to do this. 
But I think you are missing my point, and I can't blame you because my argument got lost due to my brevity I'm afraid. 
I might actually agree with you (I think, because you don't explain your point, just like I didn't). 
The issue is when there is a fork with two chains that both have a major following, with the two parties both not willing to give up on their chain. 
In that case I think the chain with the most hashing power wil win because they can (ultimately) sabotage the chain with less hashing power. Also the longer chain will be perceived as more secure, since you need to invest more to tamper with it. There are more advantages of having a longer/stronger chain in case of a contentious hard fork that I won't go into right now, but I think you understand this since you yourself claim to be knowledgeable on this point. 
I quoted satoshi because I thought it was clear what it meant, but I am reminded again that things are not that easy on reddit. Especially in current times when opinions are so polarized.

Also posted in the comment section on your blog: 
"I really don't see the issue to be honest. If your customer makes the conscious decision to use a replaceable transaction, then he has to deal with the consequences of that decision. I do not see your service suffering since he/she did it by choice.
If I were to use your service I would not opt-in to use RBF because I value 0-conf more in this use case. It gives people a choice, I just can't see how this would harm your business.
Also, I don't know if "double spend" is a correct term when using RBF. From the moment the transaction is broadcasted it is 100% clear that it is open for change, so you can't really say it's spent. When not flagging for RBF you signal your intention to make the transaction final. If you then do try to spend it again then the term "double spend" is appropriate imo. This feature allows people to be more explicit about their intentions.
And btw, I think wallets will play an important role in how RBF will be perceived by the user. How the RBF option wil be made available in ui/ux wil determine how it wil be used. I haven't seen any ideas on this yet, but if implemented well it wil remove the whole "double spend" connotation.

Actually you have a point and I take back the comment you replied to, they have done a lot for the bitcoin ecosystem. 
Although I still don't think it's very useful to introduce yet another way to scale bitcoin. 
I'm concerned about them having too much influence over the protocol as they are not neutral. There are many ways to scale, but they want it just a little bit too soon I think.

I don't know if you can characterize his statement like that. I think what he's saying is "it doesn't matter how many (different) versions of the software there are, because in the end it will be decided by what we agree on, not what we don't agree on".
Also mind this was recorded sept. 2015, right after XT released. Things were pretty heated back then and his answer is partly a response to that.
At least that's how how interpret it, mostly because I can't imagine Nick saying (or rather meaning) such a thing.

@_date: 2016-01-16 21:21:10
A 3.75MB effective blocksize would not be healthy for the network even by research by one of classics lead developers jtoomin. 
There is a reason jtoomin has dodged the 2MB+SW question every time I've seen it asked to him.

The title of this post does not summerize his message very well I think. He seems to be against LN as the *only* solution for scaling, and does not want to contribute to that future. 
I have no doubt Andreas will implement support for LN alongside other scaling solutions (like bigger blocks for example). Solutions like LN do not only increase capacity (for certain types of transactions), but also bring other useful features to the table that are very desirable to have, certainly on mobile apps that are usually used to store and use small amounts of bitcoin.

Good points and I agree. It's also quite possible that Mike was taken advantage of and didn't see it coming because of his frustration, he's only human. It's not hard to imagine he was influenced by people like Tim Swanson, who is known for his negative/pessimistic perspective on Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-01-01 09:23:06
After reading this thread I think you rely too much on your "miners vote" analogy. 
Miners are not "unmoved movers"; they act as a part of the system. Just like a single gear in a mechanical watch does not determine what time is is, but all the parts together wil. 
The miners are like a train: they can only move forward on the tracks that have been laid out by the network (through means of concensus). 
@_date: 2016-01-07 17:13:00
There is absolutely a reason to promote it. Many people only focus on segwit as a scaling solution (like the replies to my comment prove).
It would be very helpful if companies like Coinbase and BitPay would not only be leaders when it comes to things that benefit them only. They have a lot of influence and I think there are a lot of misconceptions about segwit that could be solved with a little education or a simple blessing [like Gavin did](
@_date: 2016-01-26 21:40:11
I have wondered about this many times. I think there are many different people with different perspectives that are coincidentally united by the "core is evil" perspective, but I'm not sure what else they have in common besides that. 
I do think that technical illiteracy plays a non trivial role; I have not seen many arguments with a technical substance to it, if any. Although I do not mean to say technical arguments are all that matter, not at all. 
I used to visit r/btc more frequent in the past, but it's hard to find any content that has much value. I do not understand the vision they have for bitcoin, most discussions are about people/ideas that they do not like, they are united by it. 
I also believe that many people think that the only thing that stand between them getting rich is "mass adoption" of bitcoin, and the quickest method of getting there is increasing the block size. I do not agree with this view and think it's very dangerous to think this way. 
Another issue is the moderation issue. It's not hard to imagine that mods are reluctant to moderate given their (the users) obsession with censonship. I think this will ultimately become their downfall because at the moment that sub is the best advertisement for people to keep supporting core. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 21:03:23
The reason classic is running 2MB is because miners indicated 2MB is about the max size the network can currently handle. If we would deploy 2MB + SW we would effectivelly cross that 'safe' limit (2MB+SW = ~4MB effective). 
If we hardfork before SW it will possibly be much more difficult to introduce SW into the system in the near future. 
Soft fork SW and hard fork 2MB allow for about the same tx/s. Sure there are trade-offs, but technical concensus seems to prefer soft fork SW. Question is, will the political influencers take this fact into consideration or not? I personally haven't heard many high profile individuals talk about it much to be honest. This fact makes me uneasy to say the least. 
@_date: 2016-01-07 15:53:03
From a pure technical perspective you're absolutely right. The system (as in the network) itself however, is only one part of the larger *eco*system which includes many more parts that have more complex ways of interacting with each other.
The network itself can never be broken by a fork (and thus can't be contentious like you said), the ecosystem however can be and that's where Nick is talking about. Notice how he's talking about exchanges, not miners.
@_date: 2016-01-30 09:45:06
Very cool! 
@_date: 2016-01-07 06:52:31
Is it really contentious if 99% support it? I don't think so, and Nick even said if ~75% support the fork it would not be a problem since they would (likely) follow by consent. 
@_date: 2016-01-25 15:52:44
I never said they had issues with it, you asked a question and I answered it as simply and honestly as I could.
But *real reality* 0-conf safety could easily change in the future. Many people who use bitcoin today are incentivized to not "break" it since most people are invested in it. When bitcoin is more general purpose, this can (and will) change since the majority of users are not invested in it like the current "early investors" like us.

The BU devs are clearly capable of writing software that can be of use to the bitcoin network. That's why I find it so unfortunate that they decided not to contribute their skills to the Core project but instead went their own way resulting in something that probably won't have much influence at all. 
I do not support the main idea behind BU, but I hope they can try to find a way to collaborate more with Core so their efforts won't go to waste. As for the article, I think it's proof that Peter does not care about being honest at all. The amount of misinformation is very deceitful to say the least (as mentioned elsewhere in this thread). He is bad news and I truly think they are harming themselves by collaborating with him. I don't know his motivations for this behavior, but I don't trust it one bit.

The relay network is [apparently]( not maintained anymore. It's still in use AFAIK, but I don't know how much miners should rely on it considering the current situation.
@_date: 2016-06-13 20:19:32
Open source is not only about code, it's also about process. Core and BU follow a different process which makes it hard for either of them to share code, especially in the case of Xthin vs compact blocks. If they would collaborate on the process, sharing code wouldn't be an issue.

I'm currently in the process of building a machine on which I will do some intensive analytics through the RPC. Is more dbcache always better in that case or is there a point where gains are diminished?
Also, I'm noticing first hand now how important it is to not let the block chain size run wild. With the analytics I'm doing it takes 30 seconds to process a 1MB block on an overclocked i7 6900k. I'm sure my code could be more efficient but it's just a hobby project of mine so I don't have the time to really dig into things. People often talk about network effects in adoption, but there is also a network effect in developers relying on the services that other developers create. Infrastructure is essential to the success of bitcoin, let's not screw that up. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 16:06:46
That would be the opportunity cost chart. 
I had to remove it because it became more and more inaccurate over time. It mostly had to do with transaction fees. Because of slowdowns on the BTC chain when profitability of BCH was higher, the fee pressure rose to about 25-30% of the total blockreward. If all miners would have mined BTC that fee pressure would not have existed, skewing the calculation.
I tried to compensate for it by lowering the fee amount by a certain amount, but that was really just a random guess. Perhaps if I had access to a mempool I could have done a bit better of an estimation, but still, it would have been a guess.
Still thinking of ways of reintroducing it though, just haven't come up with the right way to do it.

@_date: 2017-10-12 22:26:06
I made something similar today and I found out that using the past 4032 blocks to perform the calculation gives more accurate results (if that is even possible with the EDA mechanism). It resulted in the BCH halvening taking ~500 days versus ~1000 days for BTC. 
The 500 days for BCH means that the yearly monetary inflation is about the same as that of BTC before the last halvening (about ~9% for BCH right now while BTC is at ~4.3%).
It's a strange situation with BCH. They depend on the EDA mechanism to survive but at the same time that same mechanism causes the price to be pressed down. 
It's all about that mysterious satoshivision I guess ��
@_date: 2015-09-21 22:33:00
Those are very good questions, and I can't give you a satisfying answer I'm afraid. 
There are a few practical arguments to use a chip though. For one you never run out, no refilling needed. That means you can depend on it in certain kinds of ways. For example if the device makes use of paid web api's to facilitate you in some kind of way, you don't have to worry about it. 
Also the device is standalone, it can manage itself without interaction of a human. That means non bitcoin savvy people can use bitcoin enabled services while they otherwise couldn't. 
But I think the most import thing is that it's a complete package, you need zero external tools. From the second you plug it in you are ready to go. That's actually a really important thing for some people (also, it would make a really nice gift to someone who is into this kind of stuff!). 
I understand your skepticism though, I'm not yet entirely convinced myself. I do know they have big plans, and they are not here for a quick buck, so I will patiently keep an eye on how this develops. 
@_date: 2015-09-13 09:13:53
I liked what he said about miner education vs miner incentives. I think we focus too much on the fact that miners can be bad actors. It would definitely be smart to try and work more with the miners instead of considering them a risk. Although that can be difficult because the majority of miners are located in China and the developers mostly in western countries. 
At least we have scaling bitcoin Hong Kong in a few months. Let's hope it works out, there's a lot of room for improvement in this area.

Anyone who's not a software developer/tinkerer is probably going to miss the point of this device. 
@_date: 2015-09-21 23:02:29
Here's a more concrete example I just thought of: you buy a bitcoin miner enabled weather station. The device connects to a bitcoin enabled weather api that asks a very small amount to provide you with high quality weather data ($0.10 per month perhaps). The miner chip does not have to be very powerful, just enough to keep itself serviced. The owner does not need to look after the device. Service provider and taker are both satisfied without any interaction or even knowledge of each other. 
There are some issues that we have to figure out, like how old miners can keep themselves serviced for example. But those could be fixed by lowering the "update rate" of the weather data.
Just an example, there are many many devices that could work in this way that would benefit from a scheme like this. 
@_date: 2015-09-21 21:12:04
Well, the price is an issue indeed, and the miner chip is not the best feature of the device. If they could make it so it costs about $80 max, and changed the miner chip with one that had some nice cryptographic functions to use in tandem with the software, than it would be awesome imo. 
For developers this is an awesome device because it integrates all the things you need to start developing bitcoin powered apps/services. This device is like a development kit for bitcoin. Sure we have random libraries and api's we can use now. But this device combines it all. Much easier to get into for developers. 
The fact that this device is portable also makes it convenient to do very fast bitcoin enabled IoT stuff. 
Without the miner chip (or a less powerful one) this device would be the ultimate prototyping kit, and I would definitely buy it.

They see a bitcoin mining chip as a new kind of system resource. I doesn't make sense at the moment, but when there is a wide ecosystem of api enabled bitcoin services available to interact with it will (at least if things go how they envisioned it). 
So it takes some imagination to see it work. We are currently in the bootstrapping phase, things will play out in the coming years.

Well, "they" don't have anything yet. But it's not only about economics, it's about infrastructure as well. If access to the network is "guarded" by a few parties that provide api's like BitGo for example, then their nodes are much more important than any random node run from somebodies home.
The BU software makes it much easier to create such a partition in the network. And worse, it's by design.

It is explained very well in the post. The nodes controlled by Coinbase, BitPay etc. are the nodes that are most important to them since the largest group of users follow those nodes. So those few percent of the nodes might actually be enough for them, they can afford to ignore the rest. 
@_date: 2016-10-24 06:19:25
Again, they don't care about the 1MB nodes. The ecosystem and infrastructure is more complex than the network only. The "central hubs" like Coinbase, blockchain.info, BitGo etc. can function perfectly well without 95% of the nodes because they depend only on their own nodes. 
Of course I would not recognize this small network as the "true bitcoin". But if they have the miners, exchanges and wallets then they have most of the important components of the network, effectively taking it over. 
This is very theoretical, but so is your 93% example (which could be very easily Sybil attacked).

Thanks for the insights, very interesting.

If you reduce those companies to their investors and leaders then they are a very small group actually. They are quite boring to be honest. Most of them are nothing more than an attempt to become PayPal 2.0.

I had typed a really long post in response to your comment but in the middle of it I came to the conclusion that I was just repeating what has been said many times before by others and it wasn't constructive since we probably differ too much on this issue. 
But I will tell you this: even if you are right about everything you said, it still doesn't mean we know anything about how BIP101 will play out in the real world with real incentives/competition. Nobody can know this at this moment, and we will only know after it has been in use for some time. 
So I stand by my point; we don't know what will happen and anyone who says he does know I'm distrustful of, especially in the way it was presented by Peter in the post I replied to. 
@_date: 2015-11-30 20:17:32
I'm impressed by the fact you already seem to know 8MB won't be a problem. Whatever your reasons may be for thinking this, I never trust anyone who is so certain of things we simply cannot know.

Have you tried other growth rates than 50% and at what rate could it be considered "problematic"?
It is also very uncertain how bandwidth and connectivity would actually develop in the future. Take Moore's law for example, it is true that hardware is getting faster and cheaper, but how long before average consumers will not be needing these state of the art processors? I'd argue we are already seeing a shift from focus on performance to battery endurance in current devices. 
Another point related to that is how will devices evolve, we are seeing a shift from wired devices to wireless. How does bandwidth scale wirelessly and how do these wireless devices perform under these network loads? 
Is it even realistic to assume bandwidth will keep on going up for the average person? Regular power consumption has historically gone up at 50% rates as well. But this certainly is not the case right now. At my apartment I do not have access to a high capacity power connection to the grid. Just enough to cook, run the washer etc. Perhaps the same will happen to bandwidth, with only certain certified entities who have access to high bandwidth connections. 
So my point is there is a lot uncertain about the future. We should take these uncertainties into account.

I think you are right, network scales at O(N^2) while each node scales O(N) or O(NlogN) depending on the ratio broadcasting/listening nodes.

I think this donation only went to exit nodes, not regular relays or guards. Can someone confirm? 
@_date: 2015-10-17 15:05:29
Yep, you are right. I thought the only option was to filter by relay type, but it seems you can limit by top n and country as well. Thanks.

I understand what you are saying but you are barking up the wrong tree. It's just that when bold statements like the one in the title of this post are thrown around one can expect some resistance. 
Like I said in my other posts, price is not interesting by itself, but because of the things it enables. It's also a strong indicator for sentiment, something that is constantly reported on in this sub in one form or another. 
Posts specifically about the price are not interesting to read about or participate in since there isn't much substance to discuss. But I take it as an indicator just like any other post. 
@_date: 2015-11-30 20:48:18
Phrased from another perspective: BIP101 *allows* blocks larger than *some* parts of the network are capable of handling. 
If this is good/bad/neutral is debatable and ultimately a matter of opinion.

" Also, I'd suggest removing   commit access temporarily while we determine what's going on as a precaution."
"  Note how  was removed temporarily in a not-unlike circumstance when he got hacked."

The exchange rate is one of the most important aspects of bitcoin since its utility is dependent on it. Bitcoin with the current market cap is not nearly as useful as one with 1000 times as much. 
Not to mention the credibility it gives Bitcoin, one of the hardest challenges to overcome at this point that is not simply fixable with a technical solution.
@_date: 2015-11-30 23:28:43
Sure, it's a completely reasonable and valid way to view this issue. My point is that this issue is deeper and more complex than Peter wants to make us believe by the way he phrased his explanation of BIP101. 
I don't like the way Peter hides important consequences of what he is proposing. It makes me think of politicians, something that is completely out of place in the Bitcoin ethos. 
Only if we are educated as a community can we make informed and well reasoned decisions. Let us not use cheap tricks to try to convince people, we could be wrong and only find out when it's too late. 
Keep your eyes and ears open, and be suspicious of people who seem to have all the answers. 
Cheers!

A consequence of the network being able to transfer higher volumes makes it more useful to you because there are (very likely) more participants and a more diverse array of services for you to transact with (since it has more 'uses').
Perhaps your use-case for Bitcoin is unconventional and those aspect do not interest you personally, but a high market cap enables a lot of interesting usages of Bitcoin that many people are interested in.


I suspected this was you actual point and I'm actually yanking your chain a bit (sorry!). Anyway, I have to say I agree with you on this one. This particular price rise (and many other that have been reported in this sub) do not interest me one single bit, but I could never accept the statement "the exchange rate is one of the least interesting aspects of Bitcoin".
@_date: 2015-10-16 18:07:33
So what you are saying is it does not interest you if Bitcoin becomes more useful?
Perhaps I do not understand correctly, but if I do, then that in itself is very interesting to me and I'd love to hear more.
@_date: 2015-10-17 15:12:37
Yeah just figured it out, see my other reply. Turns out there are more ways to filter where the tip goes to then I had originally thought. 
Good job on the node! What specs do you run the node on to do so much bandwidth? Or does it depend on other factors like geographical location (peering) for example.

I think that's from another tip, [this]( one to be precise.
