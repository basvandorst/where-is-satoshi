Also for those of you who can read Korean, here's the news for the specific conditions under which Koreans will be able to trade crypto currency via exchanges:
Here are six rules that all crypto currency exchanges must follow, according to the task force:
-Deposits to be saved separately 
-Provide thorough explanation 
-User must have verified real-name 
-Establish anti money-laundry system 
-Asset protection system such as decentralized storage 
-Disclose all transactions with details to the public

I agree. I would actually feel better knowing that exchanges will be more safe and clean.

Oh, well that kinda sucks. Didn’t know the website is owned by That guy. I’ll try not to link from there in the future. You can still refer to the original Korean news article in the comment. I’m not bought account  spam though :) so please don’t go witch hunting.

Some kind of encrypted codes used between secret agents? I’ve heard North Korean spies used something like this.

There used to be a myth among some Koreans that sleeping with a fan turned on could kill you.
@_date: 2018-02-20 14:56:45
The myth has been busted long time ago lol(used to be a thing 10+ years ago) so no, unless you're a very old person living in rural area or something. We joke about it time to time though.

What is the time limit?

Ty. Good luck!

Well, you can learn from it if you choose to do so.
Or decide that this game is not for you and walk away. You broke even anyway.
There's a reward because there's a risk. You didn't fuck up, you played it safe(or at least tried to).

If you're mining bitcoin, you can expect to profit for ~10-20 cents per day using a pretty good gaming VGA(1060gtx for example)card. It has long past since gaming VGA was used for mining bitcoin. Miners use speciallized equipment thesedays. 
The only chance you have of using your PC to make meaningful money is to mine altcoins that are under the radar atm but will be popular in the coming days. 
But what are those coins? That is the question. If I know that I'd be a billionaire in a few years.
