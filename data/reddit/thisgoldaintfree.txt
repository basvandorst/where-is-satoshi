Why in the world would it accept bitcoin? Enjoy paying 20 dollars or more in fees for your 30 dollar per year subscription idiots.

Why would anyone buy something from Microsoft with bitcoin? Enjoy paying 30 dollars extra for a 30 dollar game.

Nah it’s safe, they’ve had a notification up for a while that wires are taking longer than expected. I guess you just can’t read. Coinbase is probably the most reputable and reliable exchange there is, handled many transactions between my bank and then with no issues at all.

What do you do in the case of a loss after initially investing? That's not the case for me but just wondering what you think!
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:34:25
You should have kept the car.
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:30:43
That’s not even remotely true.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:26:42
Why would you hold when you are expecting such a massive correction, that sounds idiotic.
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:56:18
If Bitcoin Cash is an altcoin why are you allowed to post about it here? This goes against the enforced rules of the subreddit yet mods allow it just because it supports their message. I think BCH is complete shit but this is just hypocritical.
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:32:58
Doesn’t work like that bud. I’m bearish on BTC but it just doesn’t work like that at all 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:07:04
Just a year ago I was able to buy games on Steam with BTC for little to no fee, and the transaction went through in a couple minutes. What we are at now is a massive step backwards, proving the technology does not scale at all. I don't know why so many people are shilling BCH in here, that trash will have the same problem. There are PLENTY of other cryptocurrencies out there which scale better, the most obvious being ETH. Sharding, plasma... people still buying BTC are way behind everyone else.
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:28:46
You still lose a shit ton of money lmao
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:14:51
Not at all
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:02:58
Do they even know anything about it? Have fun paying 20 dollar fees to buy a 5 dollar pokemon card.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:44:05
So what, you made money and that’s what actually matters here. And if you have no faith in your investment then you should sell anyways.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:08:03
Yeah people who have no idea what they are buying into.
@_date: 2018-08-06 17:42:44
I thought I was on for a moment and that the users had finally come to their senses based on the comments
@_date: 2018-08-22 17:42:15
Only reason you care is because you’ve been told it’ll bring price up. Fuck off.
@_date: 2018-05-01 04:53:36
Those fees tho 
@_date: 2017-02-03 15:27:00
What is a BU
@_date: 2017-02-08 15:18:55
Now seems like a great time to buy in, I am still feeling like it will continue to increase fairly exponentially with time. Can't go up every single day though.
@_date: 2017-02-21 04:23:54
Do you not see the "913.73?" lol
@_date: 2017-02-06 00:58:25
Yes but because GDAX is the exchange (you can use your same account and everything) you literally pay lower fees. Like it will cost you less money to buy the same amount on GDAX. Significantly less if you are buying in bulk
@_date: 2017-02-05 23:03:43
@_date: 2017-02-05 23:02:53
Use GDAX for purchasing and selling bitcoin you will have less fees. Same with withdrawing.
@_date: 2017-02-12 22:11:26
Yeah I would recommend copay, it has worked great for me!
@_date: 2017-02-21 04:00:01
You are conveniently forgetting the day when it dropped down to like 930...
@_date: 2017-02-06 01:29:24
No problem, it should help a lot for the future though. I know when I used my credit card they'd charge like 5% extra in fees when purchasing from coinbase but I decided to just check out GDAX and it's only 0.25% on all transactions, I am not sure about the difference with withdraws though. If you are really investing a lot of money into this it will help a lot!
@_date: 2017-02-03 15:22:17
Ew that's a huge rip off, why would you ever use this?
@_date: 2017-02-21 17:51:28
2 bitcoins will cost you 2230 dollars right now...
@_date: 2017-03-19 04:54:13
Has this price thread always been here in I used to check in here for news and then recently used a lot but this is definitely a nice addition if it is new! Good to have some actual price discussion on this subreddit
@_date: 2017-03-02 13:55:40
Wow that sounds like complete BS, they scammed you hard on that tbh
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:50:59
Try messaging them directly on the Coinbase support accounts on reddit or on their Twitter, if you send enough messages they'll fix it for you probably since it sounds like you resolved things. Worst case scenario make a post on complaining 
@_date: 2017-08-02 19:22:57
Why are people still commenting here I posted days ago and my personal problem has since been resolved
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:00:29
Uh.. because there was an agreement made which relies on both sides fulfilling its part? Jeez, everyone was so happy about this but when they realized they could get away with only having the other party fulfill their end of the bargain they got stupid. This is ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:41:44
This issue has been resolved but it took over 72 hours to get the money back. They acted like it was sent to my Coinbase account all along lol but it just never went anywhere (no notifications or mail and it wasn't there before), I recommend posting a lot of complaints and sending emails to their support otherwise things will never get fixed. A few days ago this was a massive widespread problem.
@_date: 2017-08-08 15:46:27
Yes, and that money they gave you out of thin air is actually worth something. Congrats :D
@_date: 2017-08-08 16:51:34
Haha yes and the funny thing is that the price of BCH keeps going up xD
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:56:41
There are multiple people that come on sometimes it's always a name-Coinbase username so I think I talked to Kyle-Coinbase but there are some others like Jesse(?) and Katie? There's info about it on the Coinbase support page somewhere one sec
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:38:02
I recommend threatening legal action, I was able to get things resolved very soon after.
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:57:32
@_date: 2017-08-08 15:51:46
Also if you wanna sell I recommend Bittrex, worked very well for BCH trading so far.
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:44:25
It took me over 3 days to withdraw, things were a lot worse than you think.
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:42:18
Did they give a reason or did it just happen? If they don't have any reason that's ridiculous - try to get it fixed without making a new account tho because if they catch that they could ban you.
@_date: 2017-08-08 15:51:29
No problem just make sure you don't make a mistake and accidentally send your BCH to a wallet you don't control. What type of wallet do you have? Different ones have different ways to access it. A Ledger Nano S lets you split your BTC wallet so that you get your own unique BTC address and then it sends the BCH over to a new BCH address solely for BCH, which is pretty nice. Some other wallets may not directly support you accessing the BCH but as long as you have the private keys you should be able to get to it using one that does.
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:43:40
are you kidding me lmao use a real exchange next time
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:29:40
Pyramid scheme has gone parabolic, get out before somebody smarter than you takes huge profits and while you were celebrating the other day, you end up with an irrecoverable loss.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:47:59
And get dumped on :)
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:12:38
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:43:44
RIP worst timing possible dude. Do u even know anything about bitcoin? So obviously overvalued.
@_date: 2017-04-05 18:23:03
That sounds like a very bad idea, confirmation times going to make this extremely frustrating for businesses
@_date: 2017-04-07 04:19:05
Can you explain to me why this is? Greatly appreciate it
@_date: 2017-04-07 04:10:35
Does using an adapter capable ruin the safety of the device?
@_date: 2017-04-18 20:27:34
That's pretty messed up that they use something someone already purchased before giving it to them, after the purchase was made. That's like a computer company opening up the packaging for your laptop you just bought, playing around on the laptop, and then putting it back in the packaging without telling you a thing. That's pretty messed up, and very weird.
@_date: 2017-04-07 05:20:29
Hmm interesting, maybe I will look into getting a ledger nano s then! Thanks for all the information, very very helpful
@_date: 2017-04-07 03:42:58
If not, are there any hardware wallets which are trustworthy and DO have usb-c capability?
@_date: 2016-09-10 20:11:35
I see they got hacked last month xD probably not the safest place to put stuff
@_date: 2016-09-10 19:21:00
So you think if I wait a super long time this stuff could be worth millions? HA never heard that one before, and it's not like that ever happened before with bitcoin :p
@_date: 2016-09-10 22:49:29
yeah it's less than one day's salary but I kind of want to hang on to it and just check on its value from time to time :) this whole concept is pretty cool and its not like i have a ton to lose by participating in it
@_date: 2016-09-10 19:10:48
So it would be wise to just keep it in my wallet for now and just hang out a while? :) honestly if bitcoin values drop to nothing this wouldn't be a big loss and if it goes up a ton that'd be cool. I think it may be fun to follow the markets for a bit!
@_date: 2018-02-09 06:37:06
Yes it actually does.
@_date: 2018-02-05 07:26:16
Couldn't care less, crypto was already banned in China.
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:17:27
You're delusional.
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:17:27
You're delusional.
@_date: 2017-09-22 13:57:28
My trusted source says mining will be banned.
@_date: 2017-09-17 01:11:58
Great so the people who made an agreement backstab bed the ones they agreed with just so they could get their own benefit and then bailed. How these groups have not lost their credibility, I am unsure.
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:24:26
Hate to break it to you but China is a communist country, they can ban whatever they feel like.
@_date: 2017-10-05 19:00:06
Uh.. genisis mining? Lol no thanks
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:24:26
Hate to break it to you but China is a communist country, they can ban whatever they feel like.

You’re all acting like all the stupid forks over the last year never happened, and that it’s impossible to change the protocol which it isn’t. There can be infinite bitcoins.

No one cares about your work, like the other poster said, get over yourself.
@_date: 2017-07-30 15:00:23
Yup 36+ hours
@_date: 2017-07-29 22:02:39
22 hours and counting.
@_date: 2017-07-31 00:08:41
There's a reason half the posts on this sub are complaining about Coinbase right now.
@_date: 2017-07-30 23:47:06
It has been about 40 hours for me. Not everyone is as lucky as you are, there is a legitimate problem here.

What he did is literally against the law, he belongs in jail.
@_date: 2017-07-31 02:08:02
How much did you withdraw, 1 BTC or less
@_date: 2017-07-30 14:01:57
About 36+ hrs for me now
@_date: 2017-07-02 00:45:50
This guy belongs in prison for his actions during the litecoin segwit debacle. Blatantly manipulating the market is not something anybody should be okay with, and is clearly against the law even in China.
@_date: 2017-07-30 14:59:36
Because I had just recently bought more after my weeklong wait for my BCH transfer was finished?
@_date: 2017-07-02 16:54:28
Actually, insider trading and market manipulation is against the law.
@_date: 2017-07-30 21:03:44
How is days in advance "last minute?"
@_date: 2017-07-02 04:13:34
You can say fuck the law all you want but that doesn't mean he didn't commit a crime or belong in jail for it. He is extremely lucky that nobody has taken action against him, he didn't even try to hide this.
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:43:31
Or it may never get this high again. Your argument holds no ground here.
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:44:04
I'm calling high 700's within the next 3 months, I have nothing to back it up but that's just my sense in general. Expect alts to go down even lower.
