thanks for the hints! Christian decker obviously already gave some really nice pointers before I started setting up the lightning node. I just published the tweet before going to sleep:  I might also try stackexchange if noone answers to my request (:
@_date: 2018-01-27 15:31:13
just because a network follows the typical powerlaw doesn't mean we have centralization. The good think about highly clustered and dense networks is that they are still resistent if super nodes fail. Look at the Internet. Obviously decentralized though heavy backbones exist.

Twitter is actually a great idea! Just using the lightning Hashtag or how will i enter communities? Would just post the link to this post on twitter an tag some people. Any ideas whom to tag on twitter? I stopped Working for today. My bitcoin node needs to finnish syncing the blockchain anyway. Tomorrow i'll be traveling hoping to have the shop running by saturday or sunday

Hey Pine, 
I know that I have also suggested an NGO in education. And I remember how hard it was for me to make that suggestion because there are amazing NGOs that do great work. I have been checking your website on a daily bases and also checked the NGOs you and your team (?) have donated to. Just wanted to say that in my opinion you are doing an outstanding job in your selection of NGOs. I am really looking forward to get to know some other NGOs. Also I am very excited for your anouncement in january. so far thanks for what you are doing!
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:42:41
yeah I wanted to actually set up a crawler for the lightning network topology. but you know so much work so little time :( if something / someone here comes up pleas remind me (:

just compare market cap of the USD with that of bitcoin and u will have a rough estimate what bitcoin could be worth if its promise holds and it becomes widely accepted as the worlds reserve currency. take in mind that there will only be 21 million BTC ever.
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:31:29
thanks for the additional information. I will consider this when working on hacking autopilot. do you have a codebase that u use to create the diagrams and extract the graph com lncli? is it maybe open source? Even thought it is straight forward I don't have to invent the wheel again, wenn playing around with some simulations. your argument of what has to be optimized was by the way already mentioned on github
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:30:35
really no problem. you gave amazing advice and pointers in the beginning! If you maybe know some people from the javascript world perfect. I also looked around in my social network. Otherwise I will write a wrapper for the same REST-API in tomcat should be fairly straight forward to wrap the lightning-cli in tomcat (: I just think it will be great to see some real usecase in production. and it is finally the reason for me to get hands on with bitcoin / lighting code (I am also planning a minor pullrequest for c-lighting soon having slightly better api documentation from what I have learned so far) anyway great work and software from what I see so far!
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:42:00
thanks! I am actually annoyed of this lightning charge node.js problem and considering wrapping the lightning-cli myself in an REST Api using my standard techstack. However I guess that it would be better to solve the issue with existing software. So I guess the upvotes might also help to find people who are willing to help out. I have the feeling I have like 85% done and now I am struggeling on the goal line...
@_date: 2018-01-19 06:46:32
proudly mentioning that the journey I am taking led to my first pull request for lighting (:  it is only a small fix in the documentation but yesterday it took me quite some time and code reading to find this out. hope I was following the correct way of making the pull request?
@_date: 2019-07-17 18:07:08
I was so amazed to see and hear him speak those words.
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:30:35
congratulations!!!  fyi our webshop is running. and since 10 minutes charged node.js server is running... still need to configure some stuff on the web shop but I assume this weekend I will announce the shop that offers lighting payment on mainnet (:
@_date: 2018-01-29 07:11:55
I added an issue to lnd github (  ) touching this problem like 2 days ago. Added your link to the discussion! I guess u assumed a uniform distribution for your random channels? of course your picture is unfair. you would need to open as many new channels for the blue line (for example following the currently implemented barabasi albert model in the autopilot) as you have added in the yellow line. anyway I like your thinking and idea a lot! (could u upload an updated graph to the github issue?)
fyi: @_date: 2018-01-16 17:18:28

@_date: 2018-01-18 16:35:24
I am currently trying to set up lighting charge so yesterday I have installed my first bitcoin node and lighting node... 
I have just opened my lighting node to the main net could anybody try to open a channel with me on this address ? 36DqbzCRcXeHbUG6C9jjxMghmuCHZg9BRn 
obviously pns from people who are willing to run some experiments would be willing. I am currently doing this to help a friend setting her medium sized webshop up to accept bitcoin payments via lightning on the mainnet
@_date: 2019-07-02 06:46:48
How do you come up with your statements? Rebalancing in your friends of a friend network - in particular with open fee free routing - should happen in less than a second and is faster than probing paths from the source. Also where did you get that lnd is going to implement a rating system?
@_date: 2018-01-20 22:27:49
The entire idea was using the wordpress woocommerce lightning charge gateway. Npm isse is resolved but even with root there were permission issues... (Very strange) Thing is c lightning seems unstable so i am testing lnd at the Moment ans see how i could maybe fork thevworpressplugin to be compatible with lnd. However thanks for the hints
@_date: 2019-07-07 19:00:11
Yes I will do that in part 2 and 3 of my video series (: if you can't I suggest you read Bitcoin wiki. One spoiler : linearity with all the consequences arising from it
@_date: 2018-01-20 11:34:28
fyi we fixed this stupid NPM problem... and honestly so glad reading your "newfangled javascript all the webby whizkids" quote. So now I just have to finnish working on the shop side. But the Http REST lighting charge server is up and running (: I hope we can announce the shop accepting lightning by the end of the weekend. but obviously I can't guarantee that... also I might look at the python implementation (and later on actually really provide a java tomcat maven repo) ttyl
@_date: 2019-07-11 14:42:17
Thanks for the write up. You are missing JIT routing.  maybe want to include it!
@_date: 2019-07-23 09:42:25
Use the lightning network because you don't want your customers be able to see how many Bitcoin revenue you had. Also lightning network is awesome for pay walls. Your customers could pay per Pic or get a monthly pass on particular with lightning joule people can set up there browser to automatically pay at your site
@_date: 2019-07-01 13:02:09
Dude thanks for realizing that JIT routing as an additional path finding strategy is currently a little underappriciated. (might be because it is still newer than other proposals and I was on a sick leave for about 4 months after publishing it) but I am really looking forward to extend it and suggest the fee free rebalancing to it. I believe in combination with AMP and trampolines we will already have pretty good path finding strategies.

@_date: 2019-07-20 20:23:43
I have been thinking about this issue from time to time. I think the mechanism of payment channels on the lightning network can be used to achieve what you want. 
you just make an output that can be spend either after a time locked by the person who is supposed to inherit the money or directly if you provide a revocationkey (which would be your change address) 
I believe (not sure!) if using a tap root construction this would not even take additional space only the script path of the spending condition will be shown.
@_date: 2019-07-07 14:42:01

Also thanks to all the open source devs (Bitcoin, lightning and devs of used libraries) and the people mentioned by Joecoin. 
As for the scaling debate : bear in mind the lightning network is just a creative use of Bitcoin. Therefor it is secure and helps to scale. It is even more anonymous.

@_date: 2018-09-25 20:32:29
but afaik they don't you have a long derivation path of an HD Wallet and for future transactions the parents are being used. What is particular strange that every time I start the code again it starts fast and drops in speed. If it had to do with your assumption it would not be fast again once I restart the code. I think one reason could be methodological from my testing (I should have checked this) as I am pushing all elements to a python list that is not fixed in its size. I would however assume that this operation for this small amount of data should still be neglectable

OMG What an incredible act of generosity! I would like to ask you to donate 80 Bitcoin to [ I have been lucky to meet the founders a couple of times and I myself are an annual donor for Serlo. The hard voluntary work to educate young children and bring them out of poverty that they have been doing since their beginning in 2009 is by far the most amazing voluntary work that I have seen in Germany over the past years. 
You are probably curious how it would help them and what exactly Serlo is doing to help so many children.
Before I answer that I would ask you to think about what made you so wealthy? 
Of course you might say:  "*It was bitcoin and my involvement within the bitcoin community/movement*." Maybe you have been a developer at bitcoin-core or maybe just an early miner or an early investor. Maybe u have been the person buying [two Pizza for Laszlo and receiving 10’000 bitcoin in return]( 
Obviously I don’t know what your role was and how you happened to have more than 5k Bitcoin to donate. However I am very confident that I do know the following: 
If you didn’t have a strong educational background and good access to information you would probably not have been involved with bitcoin and would not have been able to create the pineapple fund. 
Boiling that down I hope that you realize: 
**Education changes everything and enables human beings to lead a self-determined life with dignity.**
But even in a highly developed country like Germany (where schools and universities are basically free of charge) we unfortunately must realize that [wealth and access to education is poorly distributed]( Children coming from financially weak families or from families in which the parents do not have a university degree are (not only in Germany) [less likely to achieve a good education themselves]( Statistically they are more likely to die at younger ages and will most likely never be able to live a self-determined life in the way as you and I will be able to do. I personally think this is outrageous. 
Over the last 8 years Serlo has tried to fight this injustice by all means. Following [the footprints of Aaron Swartz]( who not only found the Reddit Website but also [wrote the guerilla open access manifesto]( In his manifesto he describes the moral imperative to free all knowledge from copyright protection in order to have our civilization based upon knowledge. 
In my personal opinion serlo already goes one step further than Aaron. Freeing knowledge is obviously a noble goal. But the next logical step is not only to create an encyclopedia or database of freely accessible and openly licensed knowledge like the Wikipedia but to create a platform and community of people that help other people and in particular children to learn from our fortune of freed knowledge and educate themselves. **This is exactly what Serlo does. With an amazing voluntary effort of many students Serlo provides educational content in the form of thousands of articles, exercises, pictures and videos for students of all ages which currently hundreds of thousands of students use every month.** 
After another person on Reddit said [(s)he would donate one Bitcoin every day until Christmas for Charity]( and after your post, I - who is a PhD Student in Web Science, watching the cryptocurrency movement for the last 5 years and [created many openly licensed teaching materials]( - convinced the people from Serlo to accept donations via bitcoin since this very morning. C.f.: [ (at the very bottom of the page) and I think they are also planning to formally hand in an application on your website. 
Again you can become witness of the terrible injustice in this world. It is my strong educational background and access to knowledge enabling me to ask you for the donation. In that sense I think it is even clearer why Serlo.org is such an important plattform.
Even if you decide against donating to serlo: Thanks a lot for your noble charity. It is amazing to see that people like you who have been lucky to get a fortune of money are willing to share it for a good cause. There are obviously many other institutions around the globe that do work that is as important or as charitable as the work of serlo. In that sense it is even hard for me to suggest Serlo who might then possibly receive BTC from you which others won’t receive. However if you would consider Serlo I am very sure it would help millions of children in Germany and eventually around the globe a lot.
By the Way Serlo is very similar to Khan Academy but does not have big donors. Also it has this touch of Wikipedia and Community editing and auditing the site. Serlo has always been struggling to survive on very small funds even though the site is well known in Germany and [won many awards]( In that sense I am sure they know how to manage money and to spend it extremely effective, efficient and wisely. 
Thanks for reading up to here. With kind regards Rene Pickhardt

@_date: 2018-05-03 21:31:00
there was a nice paper on the arxive recently posted here. It showed how price and active addresses are correlated. when you extrapolate this you will see a much higher price of BTC than todays levels as soon as mass adoption takes place. Also the prices should become much more stable when people star paying goods with crypto and not with fiat... IF hyperbitcoinization takes place (and obviously there is quite some way to go) I guess a gallon of milk shoul be around 100 satoshi.

You could upload the visualizations to wikimedia commons. It is the media archive of the Wikipedia. I have written the german article about the lightning network and would love to include such picture. They support full resolution. If you need help send me a pn.
@_date: 2018-05-25 07:00:22
In my opinion this is a really useful and smart application. When u are a store you either gave tonspendvyour btc again (which currently is not realistic) or you have to somehow rebalance your cannals. With strike there is a service provider maintaining this for you. If successful they become a central hub within the lightning network (which does not mean the network will be centralized) and the can much better care about clearing of balances. Also I like having the people from a company in such a spot that actually spend effort bringing out own source technology rather than some random money grabbing exchange. So I like!
@_date: 2018-08-28 21:36:07

First of all: I don't hodl a lot since - like many others - I lost some in the early days on an exchange when it suddenly disappeared.
Second: I have faith in humanity and society. (And I am shocked by the fear of the people here)
Third: There are way easier (and more lucrative) targets than me available. For example so many publicly known millionairs (:
Fourth: after learning from the exchange experience I can't even access my cold wallet without the help and involvment of several third parties. So the 5$-wrench attack would be annoying but probably inefficent. In particular if physical violence was applied the attacker would face serios criminal charges.

 in c-lightning sendpay Send along {route} in return for preimage of {payment\_hash} so without having a payment hash it is going to be tough ... you could give your node an alias like "yout node has an open mailserver on port 80" and create a channel with the node. maybe they see it but I guess this would be a lot of effort

I was front runner for the german pirat party during the last federal election cycle. The german pirat party defines itself as "social liberal" and I can tell you I was and am holding up the left wing of that party. That being said I would debate that bitcoin (assuming hyperbitcoinization) is great from a left perspective for the following reasons:
- currently banks and wealthy people are too powerful and bitcoin (theoretically) distributes that power
- you can only lend bitcoins that you have and not have this strange demand deposits
- the interest policies by the central banking system is basically taking money from the poor and middleclass in order to refinance the government spendings without people realizing this directly
- bitcoin can become a worldwide accepted currency - uniting people over different cultural backrounds is a very left idea - and as such on the long term reduce speculation on currencies which creates more price stability for goods
- to some degree bitcoin is very similar to a "vollgeld" (sorry did not find a proper translation for that) system which I guess is a rather left idea.
- blockchain (not bitcoin in its current form) could easly lead to some crytocurrency which has the universal basic income as part of the protocol encoded into it helping to make distribution of wealth more equally. 
Well I guess there are more arguments. Excited to see what people will post and great question by OP.

Do you remember the android version of your old phone? Maybe you can install a virtual machine running an old android (from your laptop or desktop pc). On that old android you could also install the old version of your wallet (best case your wallet is open source and old versions are on github or on their page). Sometimes developer make tiny updates thinking they are backward compatible but in reality they are not. So i would try to run the exakt same software.
Ps: i also backuped the Linux system that I used in the past (together with the wallet software) after I created my offline cold storage. Just in case software changes or had a bug or whatever. And yes I know bitcoin is a protocol and therefore should work independently of the used software. Still I felt more comfortable with my - I admit little paranoid - aproach.

well you can set the units like mBTC (milli BTC) in your wallet so that makes it fairly easy to have the decimals correct

 you can open many channels. maintaining a channel comes at almost no costs. however funds in channels are bound to the channel an cannot be moved without the lightning network. also it is currently not recommended backing up the files that maintain channel state as old state could resolve in punishment and forced channel close. so with the current state of the software I'd say it is a littel risky
 I guess that means exactly that

8 hours of \(fun time \(!\) and finally learning some crypto libraries like the python reference implementation of BIP39 and the electrum libraries: Thanks to OP for giving an incentive to move those up on my "want to learn list"\) yesterday. 
Here a summary of what doesn't work \(I might actually be willing to team up and share my source code on github if people wanna jump in \(e.g. u/thegreatmuffin what about u?\):
I spotted 18 words from the BIP39 list that have an intersection with the orange B \(actually 16 \+ the numbers 3 and 12 which I converted to the words three and twelve\) I looked up the word order of first apearances of those 18 words in the paper \(excluding multiple occurences\). However the checksum of the last word doesn't come up. 
So I took every subset of 12 and 15 words \(respecting the order\) where the checksum for a BIP39 seed summed up. Those where 1214 seeds. none of which produced the address that was provided. 
also checking all permutations of those 18 words won't work since I can only check about 3k permutations per second and there are way too many permutations for this to be reasonable. Also it is not even clear if we are really talking about those 18 words... 
now u/cryptogreetings gave the second hint about thinking in pairs. at the moment I am completely lost what that could mean. I guess we are talking about word pairs but what kind of wordpairs and how should we find them?

While generally the distribution of multiple aggregated dice rules is not uniform I am not sure if I agree with that argument in our setting. 
Keys are the order of the point in the ec group. Since the order is cyclic the aggregate key is a sum modulo group order. In particular if the amount of dice rules is not known to an attacker I would assume that this is a good source of randomness.
Also in the case of schnorr and musig I belive the aggregate signature contains a hash of the key set which also adds randomness.
Please correct me if I am wrong as I am not very confident about the statement and I want to learn

May I add that recently JIT routing was proposed by me at  from what I hear there seems to be a growing number of devs getting behind the idea that JIT routing will be more effective than AMP.

The internet is much older. Like almost 50 years. The world wide web is a protocol build on top of the internet (in a sense making the internet way more usefuland helping to spread adoption) just as the lightning network is build on top of Bitcoin.

Very nice analogy! I might use that in future when I explain Bitcoin and lightning. Though I use courts for the Bitcoin network as they verify the hashed time locked contracts and the revocable sequence maturity contracts for the lightning network. But along your argument also in the real world I don't go to a judge everytime I make a contract with someone. In fact most of the time we don't. And when we transact without contracts (like services build on top of Bitcoin) the analogy holds as you described which means we are in the wild west of federal reserve banking. So while I like your analogy I believe lightning is far more crucial towards scaling Bitcoin in a secure and trustless way

If you ask for its value then I guess there is no means of foreseeing how the market will evaluate any asset in the future. But it seems to me that Bitcoin is still heavily undervalued and probably still will be undervalued in 2021.

it won't fail! the payment process is then settled on chain for the link that broke the rest happens offchain. Once the HTLCs are all set up and the preimage is released there should be no way back. I will soon make a video exactly about how this propagation process works. And thanks to your comment I recognized that I should simulate exactly the behavior of a node going down while the preimage is being propagated back because this really seems to be the most interesting case and also the case where bitcoin and lightning heavily interact / support each other!

That is actually normal! The routing works by setting up htlcs to the destination. Once the destination receives an incoming htlc and releases the preimage it has its money and shows that. Meanwhile the nodes in the row propagate the preimage back to you to get reimbursed. This is way the receiving node will always see the payment as finished before the sending node.

Thanks for this great summary as I just taught to the residents of this year's lightning residency at Chaincode there are actually more problems with AMP. check: 
- Routing time increases: Time =  max{time for each path}
- Probing still is necessary for every path
- Not even clear if likelihood for successful payment is higher (details on next slide) 
- More HTLCs in flight (Statistically more space wasted on base layer if channels break / Channels might become overloaded. (remember routing time increases too!)) 
- HTLCs are smaller (maybe even below dust?)
There are solutions for pathfinding like Tampine routing  and JIT routing.

If you follow me on Twitter you might have seen that I went to hospital for 10 weeks in March c.f.:  before that I released more than 200 slides which I prepared to help me structure the book and thoughts and content (same tweet). I just came out of hospital as of beginning of this month. Doctors still signed me ill until next week. Yet right now I am preparing the lightning residency by chaincodelabs by the end of the month where we have an extensive one week lightning network training program / curriculum for which I am one of the mentors (the only independent one yi might add). Meanwhile I have answered more than 150 questions about Lightning on Bitcoin.stackexchange.com since the beginning of this year making me the most active educator in that category on that platform. 
All of this also goes directly back to the book writing process which I hope to be able to continue on a more regular basis by July. So yes while the git repo is inactive the progress itself is ongoing and the project is far from being dead. 
As for the symbolic amount. When I created the fundraiser the value of btc was perceived much lower. If it becomes necessary I will also share funds with collaborators of course.

Technically it is possible and not prohibited by the protocol. However none of the current implementations implement this so you autos have to patch your node. You have to make sure that the state is really synced in a consistent way.

They have strike which serves as a payment provider with lightning for businesses and a Potential competition to opennode and bitpay. Also they might earn routing fees or offer routing services. The game of providing liquidity yields also investing business opportunities. As said below. The idea this early in tech is to collect knowhow. The business model will come. Running the biggest lightning node should already give them plenty of insight

@_date: 2019-06-28 11:40:31
It can't be done with that hook as that hook sets lightningd on hold until it returns. So lightningd can't do the rebalance before returning the hook and continuing the regular payment. Otherwise I would have already provided the plugin. Anyway I think we get a stronger JIT in combination with slight protocol modifications anyway. And when doing that we could implement local / link AMP which is basically JIT without rebalancing. 
Maybe could change the logic of that book and provide a non blocking api (:

First keep calm. They were there for years they will be there for another couple days. 
2nd. If you are absolutely positive that the private keys to the coins are there and that your hard disk was not encrypted invest the money to buy a second notebook. Install Bitcoind get a few mBTC, break the display go to a store and get help for discovery of your test notebook. Don't tell them what is on the original. 
If that went well do it again with the real deal or learn how to do it with the real deal yourself by observing the shop with your sandbox environment.

She did say "lightning network" on television to argue that Bitcoin does scale. Her wording could have been less technical but I am astonished!!!
@_date: 2019-02-21 09:50:26
bear in mind that the algorithms for calculating routes are linear an the amount of nodes and channels and that a cellphone can easily do 1 billion computations per second as they have GHz processors. So I don't see the limit with 1 Million that you mention. 
Also it should be sufficient to do the routing on a partial view of the network. no necessity for me to be aware of all nodes in asia if I am in germany and paying people in germany.

I am an independent lightning network developer who also creates open source educational content to onboard other developers. Check out  to learn more about my lightning book project and Youtube channel. 
I will voluntarily be helping with chaincodelabs lightning residency in two weeks in NYC. 
In contrast to most Bitcoin /lightning devs I do that work in my free time as I am not a long term Bitcoin HODLer. Thus I would highly appriciate even a fraction of your funds which would allow me to stay independent and help to improve lightning and education about Lightning.

I thought of this too in the past but keep in mind there are more than 21 million houses in the world. So I think we will experience the time where a Bitcoin can buy several houses...
Keep in mind not everyone in the world will be able to hold 3 mBTC. At least in Germany the average networth of people (which is a stupid metric on several levels) is 60k euro. A house is 5 to 10 times as much. 
In that sense if the average person owns 3mBTC and a house is 5 to 10 times that much I guess we can expect 15 to 30 mBTC will eventually buy a house. 
1. 1 btc = 1 btc = 100000000 satoshi
2. Never measure success / worth of Bitcoin in fiat money.
Convince your friends to own at least a couple Millibitcoin. Though at current prices I always suggest friends and family to own at least 1 BTC

I love the fact that the capacity was spread over several nodes connecting to about everyone and provide liquidity and inbound capacity to the network. 
However not sure if this is a good thing yet:
1. Despite the fact that the software becomes more and more stable it is still easy to loose funds on the lightning network. In particular since backing up Chanel state is still not solved. 
2. This will also cause more problems in routing (in the short term since the nodes don't see the balance)
3. With dual funded channels this would have been really huge
4. There is an nginx running on the same machines so not sure how well they are secured.
5. Seemes like all nodes are lnd and they used the autopilot. This means that the topology just grew in a non optimal way
6. They did not come forward about who they are and what they are doing. At this stage we need open experiments and feedback
That all being said I am excited to see where this is going. In any case for opening new channels it makes now sense to connect to one of the lnbig.com nodes since one will be able to reach many other nodes
@_date: 2018-11-12 07:21:23
We just had the 2nd lightning developer summit and people are about to head home. I think the currently agreed upon Roadmap will be published soon on a wiki page of the lightning-RFC repository and distributed over the lightning-dev Mailinglist.
Main changes from my perspective will include :
- Dual funded channels
- Rendevouz routing
- Splicing protocol
- AMP routing

If you need help with clightning you can drop me a message.
Side note : how does the lntipbot work? 
@_date: 2018-11-22 06:48:31
Thanks for sharing this story and your actions. Especially the part with the homeless person is touching since homelessness is a huge
social problem. And poverty is usually not easily faught.
I recenrly tried to help two people that were endangered of becoming homeless (c.f.  sadly noone was able to help out)
I wish I had met you because you seemed like a person who cared.  I lost contact to these two people as they are most likely homeless now. Therefor I am not asking for a donation here but just elaborating on the problem
@_date: 2018-11-09 19:24:10
Oh and I forgot to mention : obviously if you remember one word for sure the entire search space would reduce drastically and the problem can probably be brute forced within 1 day
@_date: 2018-11-17 07:50:12
Currently if the Harddisk of your lightning node crashes you will most likely loose the Bitcoins in your lightning node as making backups is not recommended.
Nothing wrong with nginx. However on nodes like this I suggest to run no other software. 
Don't think they try to scam people / exploit stuff at this time. At least I can't see how they would do so. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 07:40:06
sorry bro, so not true. I bought the dip and I am completely fearless (which is actually amazing to myself realizing that just 1 month ago my bitcoin net worth was twice as high. I touched lightning even on a source code level this is revolution...
@_date: 2019-01-15 21:06:12
average is such a poor metric for data that is not following a normal distribution. They also use the median at many places to depict statistics
@_date: 2019-01-23 09:31:22
Why not? What could be improved? 
@_date: 2019-01-05 16:22:11
Are you actually aware of the fact that you are writing history here? This writeup is great and precise and should be a standalone blog article!
I would tip you with the lntip bot but I think I have heard that you don't like custodial services for the lightning network! 
Anyway thanks for pulling me inside this discussion otherwise I would have missed this great explanation.
@_date: 2018-11-28 07:04:12
I believe asking cryptotwitter is somewhat misleading as the result is not a representative statistic.
That being said I am not convinced that 40% of the general population would be very disappointed as I think 40% don't even own Bitcoin. (if 40 %of population owned Bitcoin the price would be much different) 
@_date: 2019-01-16 14:00:38
yeah sorry I was unspecific. What I meant was that the median in the context of the lightning network makes more sense than the mean. in general averages are tough because they are obviously simplifying.
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:50:48
how can the goverment support a dip. in order to create a dip you would need to sell bitcoin
@_date: 2019-01-27 00:53:30
The problem is that the onion routing in tor is simpler than the one on the lightning network since in tor always has just 3 hops. But yes I did not look deeper into the ephemeral keys since this is almost a different topic. I was hesitating including this detail anyway. Good to know that it was exactly that point that was confusing.
@_date: 2018-11-30 07:08:31
Shared on twitter (: We very much need creative services like this.
One question though: why is lightning in there? wouldn't this work perfect without payment or is the idea that the user should pay for 2fa?
@_date: 2019-01-27 00:52:09
I have it in the title already and playelists for all levels on my channel. but Yeah I could mention this in the beginning once more. good idea!
@_date: 2019-01-06 02:34:30
I believe he does not only think that the gossip would overwhelm node implementations. I think it is common sense among the lightning devs, that the gossip protocol seems to be the bottleneck of the lightning network
@_date: 2019-01-22 17:51:57
Thanks for this feedback! it is honestly the video I put in most effort so far (little bit more than 2 full days for recording and production - besides of course the time over the last year during which I studied the BOLTs and everything). Though I am also satisfied and proud with the result I am not sure if I will be able to continue to create more videos like that since that currently doesn't pay my bills. 
On the other side I would love to continue with educating people about the lightning network. I have been working in education for almost 10 years and this technology is so amazing that I believe it needs to be spread - which in my opinion can only be done with education (: 
@_date: 2018-11-10 20:38:45
Won't have time befor Nov 23rd. If you do need help after that time ping me a pm. It seems like you are able to execute code. With you knowing 1 word for sure (with or without position - almost does not matter) this should become solvable
@_date: 2018-11-09 19:19:24
With that information I can create a python script that brute forces all 3 grams (basically test all combinations of 3 words). 
As far as I understand Brute force is the only way to go for bip38 passwords.
How long will the program run?
 Assume 50k English words (start with the most common words wich come in several variations because of leet and maybe low chance of double typo while entering) you have (50k)^3 combinations to test. That is 1.25 *10^14. Which would take about 400 years to Crack with 10k tests per second. If you are 100% certain that you didn't use a word twice the test space would reduce by roughly 1/6th. Meaning only 70 years
However if we can reduce the search space things might change. For example if you would be able to say that words have been a certain length of characters or if we assume the words would all have been nouns and we start with the 5k  most common ones you get a speedup of 1000 meaning roughly half a year on one machine. Or when knowing for sure that words have not been used twice it will be 1 month on one machine. 
So I think it will be feasible to crack your password. 
I don't like the fact, that people are taking a percentage like 15% for it. I am currently traveling. But I might just write the program you need and open source it. It might be useful for others too. 
Disclaimer : not sure if 10k tests per second is reasonable. Never looked into Bip38 in detail but I assume it is a standard symmetric encryption and should be easy to compute
@_date: 2018-11-13 08:09:32
I would also suggest to fund ZmnSCPxj since ZmnSCPxj has proven to do great contributions to the lightning network development. 
If you are looking for someone more public shoot me a message. I am more than happy to accept secondary funding - I already have some funding to secure my absolute minimum costs of living. Better funding would absolutely enable me to continue with my evolvement (in particular by creating more teaching materials about Lightning for developers). I am also considering starting a company that builds products on top of lightning to accelerate adoption. You find my donation address at  
@_date: 2018-03-25 15:29:40
That does not work. Currently channel fundings cannot be increased after channel establishment

You are really doing an amazing job briging lightning dev to enthusiats and end users. Keep it up and thanks. Ping me once we have eclaire on mainnet i will do my first mainnet lightning transaction which is not for testing to send you the symbolic tip of 1 satoshi (;
@_date: 2019-01-01 21:38:54

@_date: 2018-02-03 08:10:07
well that UPS news doesn't seem like it is high priority. in any case it will only be usefull to them if they make lightning
@_date: 2018-02-14 07:34:52
That is already being done 
@_date: 2018-02-27 23:03:52
I think (which means I am not 100% certain) all nodes have to be online for the sender to prepare onion routing and for the routing to be completed. I think in theory routing requests could be delayed / handled asynchronously. but that yields also a question of channels running out of balance and having intermediate nodes going down or channels being closed and payments stuck in the network... 
@_date: 2019-01-06 02:32:59
I think all the lightning developers are aware of the fact that the gossip protocol is quite noisy
@_date: 2019-01-06 11:54:12
The purpose of the gossip protocol is that the network shares information about which nodes and channels exist back to the network. This has nothing to do with the trustless construction of a payment channel via revocable sequence maturity contracts and also nothing to do with trustless routing via hashed time locked contracts. 
@_date: 2019-01-02 09:15:47
which language do you use? python? can I help you?
@_date: 2018-11-17 16:12:43
Did you check if the external hard disk is plugged in correctly and / or not broke? 
@_date: 2019-01-07 08:46:54
as described in the git repository I am willing to accept help and written input:  but that takes coordination. Some of the topics that you have written about are already planned. But channel factories would certainly be something for the advanced topics chapter. Neutrino is something that I have even forgotton so far. That is why a community approach is so important (: 
I have opened an issue on github with your input: 
 I would suggest that I create a solid basis and than you could certainly help with special sections but let us coordinate this at a later stage (:
@_date: 2019-01-07 01:54:48
As I explain in the announcement video (which you can see here  and which I will put on public tomorrow) and on the tallyco.in page I will write this book in an open source effort mitigating some of your concerns (which I totally share with you)
Also I believe that some parts of the lightning network and its technology stack are quite fix. So the audience of the book is not a protocol or core developer but rather a developer who wants to build on top of the lightning network as well as people who are interested in bitcoin and the lightning network. So I think there should be enough "fixed" content. 
Still I believe that with all the materials out and the constant change it is better to have at least a book and central point for education instead of waiting. If you look how the lightning network starts to take off I am afraid that when people are looking for information such a book would not be ready and we loose people. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 05:09:40
We are still testing but as anounced on  the  webshop will accept lightning as soon as it goes online
Will send you a pull request as soon as we are there

It is amazing to see on [tallyco.in/s/lnbook/]( how many people actually tipped with lightning so far. Also if users here on reddit want to find a way to spent the hard earned tips from the lntipbot (: 
Thanks for sharing the campaign. That is exactly the support that is needed for a community project (:
@_date: 2019-01-29 00:06:03
I am proud to have passed the torch with a value of about 2m Satoshi. This trustchain feels historic (:
@_date: 2018-02-03 07:57:53
sad to see that this is your take from it. bitcoin is an amazing technology like the internet and becomes even more usefull with lightning (as the internet became through http). The internet meme is just amplifying this vision. in particular bitcoin is not about investing but about liberating our money system. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 08:01:28
lets meet there on arrival (:
@_date: 2018-11-11 21:47:18
First of all congrats for being successful by continuing to trying. 
You could fund some developers who provide useful open source tools. Like the password cracker. Or Luke dashjr was recently looking for funds. 
Fyi:your password are 4 words. If I had helped you we would not have found it.
Another Idea: I am currently looking for someone who wants to help with my YouTube channel which is mainly about Lightning network development. Having a video team would make it so much easier and faster for me to provide more educational content about Bitcoin and lightning network.
Also in general : if I had 75 btc I would continue to hodl or at least keep them in the ecosystem
@_date: 2018-02-04 08:03:16
No you can move your btc to a segwit address and after that open paymentchannels so that you will use lightning
@_date: 2018-02-03 07:49:43
haha that is funny I also had my eye on the stars (:
@_date: 2018-02-27 22:08:03
Thanks for the write up and thoughts. I would like to add a thought on end to end encryption and privacy
I once have been sitting in a talk by Vicent Cerf. He mentioned that the 2 worst mistakes while Developting TCP/IP have been the small address space and the fact that encryption was not part of the protocol. Therefor I think it is important to not neglect the questions that u also mention in your post. 
In that sense I actually really wonder why not more privacy is included to lightning. Obviously from network topology and flow of money - even if one only gets a local view - one can deduce quite some information. 
You mention end to end encryption at the end of your article: I think that is a great idea but as Ladar Levison who ran the email service lavabit experienced on first hands in the after maths of the revalations by Edward Snowden even metadata should be kept private. in that sense I wonder if anyone in lightning dev has looked at  (I am only aware of the fact that the Dark Mail Transfer Protocol exists and hase been specified and is being pushed forward even by People like  who obviously is often mentioned together with Hal Finney)
2 other comments: 
1.) I would love to write that comment directly under your blog post and not on a social media site
2.) In your oppinion: To which of the lighting git projects should I post the links to the DMTP as a feature request?
@_date: 2018-02-04 07:51:57
Why after your comment would you even day trade? Btc is for hodling. It is why too risky to sell since you can loose value once the price goes up
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:52:25
that depends on your viewpoint. I am completely in for the technology and I know that innovation cycles even in the time of the Internet are still taking many years. so yes it seems that the people investing for the technology are not the majority at the moment. but every day more people are getting educated about bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-03 07:54:58
lightning is one of the best names for a technology I have seen after being like 10 years working in tech. it is literaly as fast as speed of light. since it's speed is limited by network requests an information is traveling and the speed of light on the internet. so if speed of light is fast enough to pay your covfefe (:
@_date: 2018-02-04 07:45:22
Very good. More people Wirth your mind set are needed
@_date: 2018-02-03 08:15:16
same here. I followed the lightning discussions for over a year and always knew it'll be cool. But after I touched the software and saw this in action my life was changed for ever. I become another person. I admit I had doubts on bitcoin in the past. but with lightning this is the most useful form of money that I can imagine of. end of discussion (:
@_date: 2018-02-14 00:04:12
I think that is the main point of this demo / project! I also wish all the best (: and thanks for your effort.
@_date: 2018-02-03 08:11:05
we might try next time (: thanks for the suggestions
@_date: 2018-02-03 07:47:39
from a high level I completely agree with what you said. Last month seeing how many people in my environment started buying bitcoin without minimum understanding of what blockchain is and how btc works shows me there is quite some hype / fomo / bubble. interesting enough thought they are seeming not to sell at the moment since they thought it is a risk / gamble anyway.
On the other hand however lightning will be so useful in comparison to regular money that people will just push their funds to btc at some point in time (not to speculate on price) but rather to use it. At that time price will be far beyond moon
as for the art work: I had the idea of this (and future graphics) but I am working together with a pretty famous instagram artist. I am helping her to set up her own web shop which will accept lightning payments and she shows her gratitude by drawing some pictures upon my ideas (: c.f.: 
@_date: 2018-02-03 07:50:44
not in mass adoption though
@_date: 2018-02-03 07:52:49
no bitcoin was never intended to be a store of value I quote mr. nakamotos famous whitepaper title: "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" it doesn't say it is a store of value. we need lightning to make bitcoin even more useful
@_date: 2018-02-03 07:37:35


Well I can only speak for the artist of this picture. We are currently in the process of setting up a shop where she sells her regular merchendise and accepts lightning payments. We are being stopped by the fact, that the technology is still pretty immature and also needs kind of expert knowledge even just to be installed (I am not talking bug fixing or so)
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:50:01
I suggest to start with the lnd project it is written in go and in my oppinion pretty well documented
@_date: 2018-02-15 07:35:08
Asked them in their medium comment feed when they will integrate lightning...  everyone should do the same
@_date: 2018-07-09 06:09:45
I talked with him in a lightning network telegram group when he asked questions about lnd. So I guess he does own the node. I think his goal is to test the autopilot feature. Since creating many channels should help me channels connect to him. However I wonder why he is funding his channels so heavily
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:53:40
people also don't convert dollar bills into something of value once they are being payed... a currency in iteself in particular if it is useful seems to have intrinsic value
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:57:16
technically and in theory banks could already for many years support fast money transactions around the world. the problem is they have legacy systems and a lot of legacy code and apis which need to be kept alive. so it becomes very hard for them
@_date: 2018-02-03 07:33:15
There is obviously a lot of emotion in the price. But once we have mass adoption of lightning we can send money from Europe to Australia within 1 second and the money is actually directly controlled by the person who receives it. That is so useful that mass adoption in a limited market will lead to bitcoin prices that many people wouldn't even dare to dream of. As simple as that
@_date: 2018-07-18 10:07:07
you need to have someone open a channel to you so that you can receive funds via his channel. if you fund a channel you can only do outwards payments. it is somewhat of a coldstart problem we have in lightning
@_date: 2019-09-16 21:32:30
Thanks a lot! Every support and step helps in the sum even if it is just a dollar. I also hope others will get inspired by your action and help so that we can have a way more constant stream of videos and educational materials (:
@_date: 2019-09-06 05:22:22
I don't want to shill my own fundraiser. But I tried raising 21 Bitcoin at the beginning of the year to work full time on an open source lightning network book and educational videos. 485 Bitcoins would have funded 23 people like me in the beginning of this year to work on Bitcoin stuff. With current price levels rather 50+ people.
I would argue that this creates way more new value for bitcoin than advertising.
@_date: 2018-02-03 07:35:10
The graphic refers to the fact, that it is not being mass adopted and actually used to buy stuff yet. The artist released that picture 2 weeks ago to announce that she will accept lightning in her webshop soon (selling only stuff at a micro payment level)
@_date: 2018-02-03 08:06:45
damn why did I even reply when you already named all the right arguments.

This is the first time I see someone other than me referring to Bitcoins on the blockchain as locked up and the ones on the lightning network to be free, liquid and movable. Upvoted for that!
@_date: 2018-07-09 10:51:40
well if he and his channel partners keep those channels open it would be actually a good strategy for new nodes or consumers to connect to u/bitcoinartist since they would get quite some good connection and flow to many other nodes.
@_date: 2019-09-07 21:19:10

This is madness. We need protocol developers and people (presumably having talent) hack or buy hacked accounts for scam... SAD!

This sounds like a manageable / brute forceable task. I guess one would have to check your password candidates against typos or a broken keyboard. Can you provide more information? For example which measures have you tried in the past? what do you know about the password. From the other thread I see you have a zero balance wallet with the same password. Can you post it somewhere?
@_date: 2018-07-08 07:35:30
Routing payments is generally speaking more likely the higher the capacity of the entire network. But also the denser the network is connected. So the key metrics will be the amount of payment channels and total BTC as an indicator of the usefulness of the network

@_date: 2018-07-23 05:32:30
Receiving is unsafe (especially on mobile) until watch towers are being implemented. Think wallets that can receive will become the real game changer but also amp and splicing is needed for the lightning network to become really userfriendly

hodlers understand that when bitcoin hit crazy 20k on coinbase with empty orderbooks and 50% price increase in one day we could have easily ended at 50k  before price stabilization took place. so therefore hodling is the save way. 
as for the comic: the artist promised me that there will be more to come. and we already developed some ideas together
@_date: 2018-07-31 22:39:33
as far as I remember: When you wish to broadcast an old settlement tx you need to broadcast its parent update tx. In case this update tx is seen on chain I can just publish the most current update tx (and bind it to the one I just saw). Since a time lock is involved to spend the outputs of the update tx with a settlement tx the newer update tx will be mined faster. Now the old settlement tx cant be mined because it would be a double spend which is impossible by bitcoin. Thus preventing broadcasting an old settlement tx at any time.
@_date: 2019-09-16 20:33:16
Awesome this is my goal! I want to help developers by providing information that is so easy to digest that it also helps the non technical people! Which is one reason why there is always some Offtopic side nodes in my videos. For example today that the fees are just leftovers of inputs that are not fully assigned to outputs. 
Thanks for this amazing feedback!
@_date: 2019-09-12 07:41:35
What about using lightning? I guess the refund is rather a micro payment this would make the non custodial case particularly strong wouldn't it?
@_date: 2019-09-19 05:54:51
I have created a small series about schnorr in the past 
@_date: 2018-07-27 18:33:02
payment channels are 2-2 multisig wallets you can put the spends of of the funding tx on the paper wallets. However you won't be able to detect cheating without watchtowers. also you won't be able to use the channels properly. All keys on the lightning network are derived from an HD wallet. also that seed could be put on a sheet of paper bringing the same drawbacks as mentioned above. So yes - like others have said here before - by the end of the day lightning network nodes are hot honey pots by design.

literally great content to teach students how to read logarithmic scales! If I remember all the times in the classroom when I said don't get fooled by the visuals in logarithmic plots. You made my day (:
@_date: 2018-07-08 06:59:14
From an abstract point of view this is where we eventually are going anyway. So upvoted!
As soon as splicing is there - at least in my mind - one will always just pay a regular bitcoinadress (which should be the address of a lightning node) the wallet will check if there is a route available on the lightning network. And the receipt will create an invoice. Otherwise a new channel will be funded / spliced out from old channels. The user don't have to think about weather the payment was done via lightning or not. This is roughly the process I try to include to BOLT 1.1 (not BOLT 11) together with the splucinfs Api.
@_date: 2018-07-18 09:43:26
just fire up you own lightning node? there are good tutorials out there! If you have your node running you can create an invoice but you will need an inbound channel with capacity. In case you still want to give away the satoshis I'll take 10'000 \* PI of it for the nerd factor. Should result in 314159 or almost half of them (:
@_date: 2019-09-01 18:03:46
Which does not mean what your are probably trying to imply - that with a growing ln pathfinding might become easier. Actually on a small network it is computationally much easier.
I still think that we are gonna be able to provide a good solution for path finding
@_date: 2018-07-31 08:28:45

The residency was an amazing service to Bitcoin. I was only there for the lightning week but the job done by the person responsible for it to create this environment was just insane. Completely not surprised by the output (however very delighted!) It also shows the importance of education in particular when executed well.

Your website has a bug. When i click on thw pricetab it says btc  = 0.000001 B. I totally see where this is comming from but it makes your data look totally wrong. So if you make that change implement it everywhere

at do i need an azure instance or can I deploy lets say that docker file on my regular server? 
@_date: 2018-07-18 10:05:53
[ this one seemed pretty rock solid to me
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:43:21
that is what I have been doing so far chill and hodl for many years now. But I think moments like this could also be used for price prediction. especially in the Bitcoin case where it is kind of easy to get access to market data
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:20:27
that is what I was wondering if the lockin is currently priced in. I think mass media hasn't reported on it yet only nerds know. But yeah there should be a second rally after  block rejection starts. very good point!
@_date: 2018-04-23 05:01:43
I do this already almost everywhere for the past 6 months. Reactions are amazing. However paying with btc has never happened if people didn't accept it before. However if lightning is there in the sense that you can send and receive with eclair or som other android wallet i promised myself that i will stop using fiat. In any case i will find people who would pay the shop if i charge them back with lightning.

After F2Pool signalling BIP 91 we have 99.3% probability to lock in this period. MOOOOOON DAY
@_date: 2017-07-20 15:08:02
Just fixed it. I now calculate &gt; 268. even though we only need 269 we can and should also also add all the other probabilities &gt; 269
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:03:14
well I could do that but I guess 99.9% in both cases should be enough. wonder when the course will explode? with these probabilities I would say it is almost certain we won't experience a chainsplit
**edit:** added 3 digits... guess it is over even if antpool wen't down or changed its signals we should have over 50% chance
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:22:07
well according to [wikipedia]( mooooooon  means 384,402
@_date: 2019-05-06 11:58:55
Haha "... The mostly unregulated coin... ". Honestly? The consensus rules make a pretty good regulation to me (:
@_date: 2019-05-20 14:09:00
When will you have lightning withdrawal and deposits ready to go? You could create a large capacity channel with coinbase and  arbitrage trading would not stuff the blockchain anymore. If you need help with lightning I am more than happy to give a workshop but I guess being based in SF you have great access to people from blockstream or lightning labs
@_date: 2017-07-20 15:25:24
with the current Ant and Slush Pool Blocks it even hit 98.3%  even if next block is not signalling BIP 91 the probability will be over 97% (: Never felt so close 2 the MOOOOOOOOON
@_date: 2019-05-21 01:00:44
I usually only do that not morr than once per Video and only a couple seconds. People told me in the past they like it. Sorry it bothers you

Here is the tweet in which I poked from maybe we convince them or other large scale educational channels
@_date: 2018-12-22 10:16:00
That funding back a channel with that person won't work with c Lightning as multiple channels between nodes is just a lnd feature. Better to wait for the BOLT1.1 update when we have Splicing and dual funded channels. Other than that I like and appriciate your effort
@_date: 2019-05-20 17:23:31
I just love it if people get it! Btw did you see that I mentioned your post in the discussion with all the energy links?
@_date: 2018-12-29 09:23:10
I was just about to start a patreon page to fund my plan for 2019 to write an educational book about the lightning network. but this is even better. I will check this out in January. 
Also I like the Idea with the email Adress to send invoices. As a quick idea to support onchain payments you could hang in Alex bosworths submarineswaps either on his site or by deploying his code. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 07:40:22
Dude that is 20 million Satoshi you are giving away! You must be a millionaire. Thanks though
@_date: 2018-12-06 08:26:29
I really need to use this tip bot more frequently
@_date: 2018-12-09 13:54:30
Thanks for your words. I agree education is key. Also for feedback it is nice to hear your say this. Since creators and educators are usually their own biggest critics it is really easy for us to hear the loud and noisy ones in particular if noone disagrees with them which is almost like silent consensus. 
@_date: 2019-05-21 05:45:55
Thx a lot (:

The only difficult moment was the day in December 2017 when Bitcoin hit 20k and the market was clearly overheated and coinbase order books seemed empty. I thought of selling and buying back at lower levels.
Problem: it could have stabelized at a higher level not giving me the chance to buy my btc back. Since I never got skin in the game to speculate I decided not to speculate at that time. Even though my feeling fas right I could have been wrong. Never felt bad about my decision. Even in November 2018. Actually I used that time to stack sats and accumulate more (:
@_date: 2019-05-24 20:29:19
So looking forward to this event! Lightning hackday is awesome
@_date: 2018-12-09 11:36:05
Also I tried to incorperate your feedback from last weeks video. So this one is quicker and less personal. Hope it is useful for many as lightning needs to gain adoption. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 10:18:40
Why not using lightning tip bot in order to save blockchain space and push lightning adoption? 
@_date: 2018-12-09 16:14:13
Tomorrow is hopefully going to be a tech video for developers. I plan to show how to create clightning plugins 
@_date: 2019-05-20 17:16:01
I was so disappointed but not surprised even with our offer of help it seems like they and other mass media outlets (even if independent) don't care. This makes me so sad as it gives adoption ;(
@_date: 2018-12-29 09:40:35
Just became your third backer and paying the invoice worked like a charm! Would love to test the service already for my book campaign (maybe I can be an alpha tester)

Why is it not listed on Bitcoin.org?

Check out  I have a small demo app together with a link to a YouTube video that explains this completely. You need to deploy a c lightning node though. But than it is really easy

As mentioned earlier. You are one of my favorite reddit posters. Whenever I read comments by you they are very insightful and enLIGHTENING (:⚡⚡⚡⚡

Thanks a lot! I am looking forward to be more productive with this channel again! Will be released from hospital one day before the  not sure if I can already give everything in June but I am really looking forward to creating more videos.
@_date: 2019-05-20 17:20:16
I don't care so much if they do a video or not. I care about not spreading wrong information if they do! And their Criticism was wrong on so many levels.
@_date: 2019-05-20 17:18:47
I just hope that the information finds its way to mass media outlets who will spread good information. That is why I shared the tweet. I hoped if it is retweeted and liked outside of our community sind people might pick it up.
Anyway thanks for your encouragement!
