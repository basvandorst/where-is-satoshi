Thanks. I just signed up. I am putting up some cellphone accessories at cost on BitcoinBF.

Is there anything that we can help? I run vovoya.com and I can offer some deals to sell at cost for Bitcoin community.

I call BS! I can easily change it with html edit. Photo means nothing.

That's pretty much the only deal that you can take advantage of using Bitcoin and you used it as example.
Check Slickdeals. How many deals are exclusive to Bitcoin users? 
It's just so obvious that people don't use Bitcoin because of lacking of incentives. If you can't get people from SD using Bitcoin, you can never get people from general public to use it.
Even Bitcoin Black Friday was a joke.

Bitcoin community is all talk. Fact is nobody is spending their Bitcoin, and adoption to new users is non-existence. Bidpay has no business if people are not spending. I have my ecommerce store and it has zero Bitcoin transaction since I set it up last year. Bitcoin blackfriday was a joke. It generated less than 200clicks with zero sales. All the bag holders are holding the btc and not spending. There is no demand and price is dropping. This is going to die slowly unless a new silkroad comes back. There is no incentive for general public to use btc. Hard to calculate the true cost, volatile, no protection, no credit use, hassle to sign up extra accounts, vulnerable to hack...

I don't know why people voting this up. Why would I give them the credit report if they are not offering me any credit. Are they doing a soft pull or a hard pull? A hard pull could hurt my credit. If they don't want to take the risk of accepting credit card, then just don't.

Good luck finding someone who's willing to spend though. Nobody is going to spend Bitcoin unless your site is Bitcoin exclusive. 
Btw, Bitpay setup is easier than Coinbase. I ve tried both.

A lot of refugees in Hong Kong are economic refugees. They abuse and exploit the legal system for claiming persecution in their homeland. They are nothing but a burden to the scoiety and it actually hurts people who actually needs to seek asylum status.

So the world stops when there is no internet and electricity? I don't want fait to totally go away. I would rather have Bitcoin becoming a globally accepted digital currency so people can use their money without ridiculous fee.

I don't know why people being so against coin base holding your coins. Bitcoin will never go mainstream if it requires general public to back up their private key and expect them not to lose it or being hacked. It's just too much hassle. Coinbase provided a good solution to make things easier. Not perfect but it's easy for general public. You don't need to use it. It's an option. Idealistically I would love to see coin base insures everything that we store with them.

Unfortunately, yes! Being able to keep bitcoin in your own wallet is a feature. Being able to remember the private key and nobody can take it is a feature. Being able to use paper-wallet is a feature. They are all different use-case of bitcoin. They are not requirement, and general public would just use whatever provides them the convenience, in this case, coinbase wallet.  Paper-wallet to me is going backward as a technology, but it definitely has it's use-case for some people. Most people use paper-wallet only because they don't trust anybody.  
Coinbase Bitcion wallet + multi-sig vault is enough for most people who use it for basic transactions. Telling everybody to move btc into their own wallet simply makes no sense, and is not helping to spread Bitcoin into general public.
It's just like buying movies from itunes/Google play. Movie is stored in their server, you don't really own it. You pay pretty much the same price as a blu-ray disc. You are just like telling people to buy a blu-ray disc, tell them to rip it into mp4, then copy it into your tablet. Your reason? Google/Apple may go out of business, and you don't own the movie if it's in their server. Guess what? most people would just laugh and continue to buy a digital copy because it's easier. The issue with bitcoin right now is "Trust" and it takes time to build trust from government, from companies, from users, and from general public...
