Each bomb has its own round. When the timer runs out on a bomb the round ends. If a bomb is purchased the timer goes back to the maximum.

Sorry, reddit picks automatically which one to use. We support both LTC and BTC.

Well, that is the hard part. Getting traffic to the site is harder than it looks.
Also I forgot to mention, we do not get the full amount of the final bet, most of that is paid backwards to the previous owner.

By template I don't mean the code/design. I mean the basic premise of a chain game, paying back to the previous owner with different profits/multipliers and that's about it. Ours is totally custom coded also :) (Excluding bootstrap for layout)

All payouts can be verified using the "Past Payouts" button on the navigation bar.

Yes they could, but they would be slowly losing money if they do that, it is an option however to buy yourself more time to sell a bomb.

Not quite a pyramid, it is a chain.
There is also no deception or trickery like with pyramid schemes. Everything is out in the open and transparent.

Only if you can't get someone else to buy it.

It sounds like you may have had a virus on your machine designed to steal coins from any open wallets. The best way around this is to use a linux liveCD to send coins from when using secure encrypted wallets.
The best thing to do is have a relatively secure day-to-day wallet with a small amount of coins in and then an offline wallet totally locked down wallet that you will very rarely access and only from a clean OS.
I hope you manage to recover some/all of your losses. Good luck with winning some more coins on our site.

They just use the basic chain game template, we've moved on from that and added our own twists to it to make it more entertaining for the players. The group purchases being the latest :)

We will absolutely never ask for any information from you other than an address to return winning payments to.
All our source code can easily be viewed in your browser if you are worried about malicious code.
If anyone does ask you for your wallet.dat file or any related information pretending to be a CoinBomb employee **DO NOT GIVE IT TO THEM**

There were posts there earlier - what happened?
@_date: 2013-05-30 17:04:45
No not quite, If you buy a bomb off someone they get their investment plus a percentage interest back, but you have to pay more than they paid.
The same goes for the next person that buys it from you. They might pay 25% more than you, but you get 15% extra on top of your original price back.

We havn't posted any official stats no, but could look into doing so.
Our house edge isn't even that much after taking into account fees, the instant win pot and paying the previous owner. Volume is indeed the key and you are correct with it being a social game it either goes viral or suffers mediocrity unfortunately. We're trying to keep it unique and interesting though.
