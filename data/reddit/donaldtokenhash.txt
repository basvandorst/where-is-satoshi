Agreed. I would suggest four columns with the evolution of cryptocurrency:
1. Bit gold (Szabo)
2. B-money (Dai)
3. RPOW (Finney)
4. Bitcoin (Nakamoto)

As interest rates fail to go higher above 3% (10 year Treasury Bond) liquidity will come back to crypto markets taking them to new highs by the end of the year or first quarter of next year.

kindly stop using the term "vote" it's a bad analogy

Yes, but the value chain is that developers propose changes, then they are discussed, then implemented and minders and node operators deploy them. If the ecosystem is dominated by a developer team that is provably corrupt and fraudulent, then, that chain, even if currently apparently technically sound, is at risk of being eventually and surreptitiously attacked by those developers.

Yeah, wealth is close enough. I think Acheulean tools began to have a standardized, commodity type shape and size because homo erectus used to make them (specialized clans with access to adequate quarries)  so they could be exchanged, not only for their functional value.
There are large caches of Acheulean tools found that have never been used giving the impression they were like treasuries.
Also, I think, if they were used as money it is only natural that they were used for counting as well e.g. laid out and aligned to count days, weeks or months until the next moon, period, season, etc. Also, to count herds or quantify distances.
Acheulean tools have been found far away from their source quarries, unused and in great quantities, so that also reinforces my idea that Erectus, Antecessor and Neanderthal had trade routes between clans.
