Following the [90:9:1 rule of tech adoption]( 90% of all users of cryptocurrencies will be on a domainant network, 9% will be on some other network and 1% will be on irrelevant networks.
A fair comparison would be Tor (90%) against I2P (9%), and Freenet and the gobs of other anonymous networking protocols (1%).
While Bitcoin may have 500 or even 1000 different "competitors", it's hogwash to pretend as if the long tail of cryptocurrencies can compete with the undisputed king. Especially since network effect and liquidity are everything when it comes to money being *money*.


But why do you need fees to be zero? AFAIK the only people who **need** as in capital NEED fees to be zero are the Patrick Byrnes of the world who want to timestamp crud over the main blockchain at the price of nuking full nodes off the network. Why can't that be achieved over sidechains? And for the users who need zero fees for low value payments and micropayments, why can't they do that like Streamium.io on payment channels?
@_date: 2015-12-21 03:20:28


Actually, the technical community at large isn't worried about trends *stopping* - we're worried the trends will stay on course which is what need to happen just to keep full nodes reasonable to run on home PCs. This at admittedly *ultra-low* block sizes, let alone block sizes potentially 8000% higher.


Deforestation takes time. Is there ever a true emergency in the Amazon? According to whom? And really - once consensus is made up that there is indeed a problem - what can actually be done? Especially with the blockchain bloat, you can't reverse it - *ever*. Bloat is permanent and we'll always deal with it forever.
And when it comes down to it, you're trusting the core team to bail you out of an emergency - whether that be a hard fork up, or a soft fork down. Hearn was correct to complain about both types of forks because in a sense both forks *do* require core consensus. Then why be aggressive with blocks? The market for cryptocurrencies - e.g. Ripple's market cap vs. Bitcoin's market cap - clearly demonstrates the market appreciates decentralization more than throughput.
Technology "allows" for much interesting stuff - as long as you're willing to sacrifice nodes to datacenters where the user experience of running a node on home PC takes a backseat to the demands of non-node running users. Unfortunately, Bitcoin will quickly shed nodes losing untold amounts of its decentralizing qualities under even the most conservative of increases. For example, the  reason given for not running a full node today is blockchain size woes. By further bloating the chain before we've even had a chance to recover node users on desktop, you're essentially condemning nodes to datacenters for who knows how long.


I'm not willing to entertain your notion that impoverished people are life and death serious for widescale Bitcoin adoption. I feel bad about it in fact, but it's true. What we need are for rich people to invest a ton of money right now into Bitcoin, and improving throughput doesn't actually help with that - well-capitalized, long term Bitcoin investors simply don't need fees to be $0 given how infrequently coins need to be moved. And when payments *do* actually need to be made, what's so bad about pushing a button to use LightningVenmo?

And interestingly, [Tor doesn't offer privacy protections for Torrent users](
Hence, Tor is one of the better analogies to Bitcoin's main blockchain not catering to the Patrick Byrnes of the world who want whizbang functionality on it at the cost of needing dangerously high throughput and extremely low if not zero fees to go along with it. Hodlers unaffected.
Especially with Rootstock.io offering the exact whizbang functionality on sidechains that they claim to need, and Streamium.io offering zero fee instant payments on payment channels *pre-Lightning* - so far we just haven't heard *any* good reasons as to why these very demanding niche use cases can't use one of the many substitutes once they become available. And all this assumes the whizbang functionaries have *any actual users* - which they don't.
Bitcoin is a P2P currency, nobody invests in Bitcoin for the low fees, and nowhere in the whitepaper did Satoshi say *anything* about Bitcoin being "a datacenter-to-datacenter cool things network".
The bottom line is you can do the whizbang zero fee gimmicks on very reasonable substitute blockchains and overlays, and the tiny TINY minority of users who think otherwise is yet to argue their case effectively in public without resorting to endless ad homs and Blockstream conspiracy theories.

Another very insightful post by Chris.


Assuming on-chain tx fees don't rise above $5-$20 - this "Visa, MC, Amex" scenario is still far preferable to centralizing the entire core Bitcoin network around Fortune 500 datacenter nodes and mining oligopolies, potentially on an indefinite basis.
Conversely, by minimizing core blockchain resource requirements, Moore's Law makes this entire scenario at worst a fleeting problem encountered only during Bitcoin's bootstrapping stage where most people are owning BTC as a speculative store of value anyway.
For example, $5-$20 on-chain tx fees aren't so obscene that ordinary people *can't pay it*. It's comparable to an international wire transfer for one - $5 is a cheap burrito, $20 is cheap vodka.
In addition, fees will only rise to these "high" numbers if Bitcoin adoption - and BTC price - *skyrockets*. If you own 100+ BTC today, that's probably going to be worth $5,000,000+ by the time these fees start getting "high", which is certainly enough capital to run a hub of your own, perhaps even a darknet payment hub.
Bottom line, if $5-20 is all it costs to transact on chain - in the short term and under a worst case scenario - then we're all gonna make it just fine.

Sure, with altcoin liquidity at 0, it has nowhere to go but *up*.


How do you figure?
@_date: 2015-12-23 06:54:52


You don't need perfect security to buy a Starbucks gift card.


You forgot OFAC regs.
But seriously, I think you're thinking way too far out in the future. At first, blockchain tx fees are $0.10, and we can justify opening a $5 Lightning channel with a local B&amp;M retailer for that price. All it takes is for two people to visit the same store **once**, and now any new place one person buys from in the future, the other person automatically gains access to. Imagine if one person has more than one friend or acquaintance, and each person and friend visits a plethora of stores, and has a plethora of their own friends and acquaintances.


But a tiny amount of value is all you really need to make *low value* payments. What's it going to be for most people? A couple thousand tops?


Did HD wallets "take years" to gain popularity? Perhaps so, but following the [90:9:1 rule of tech]( you don't need ALL wallets - you only need the 90% adopted wallet to add Lightning. It's far more attainable than you're making it out to be.
@_date: 2015-12-22 17:57:16


Do you pay with gold in person? No. You use VISA and other very rapid payment methods - just like Lightning or a Coinbase built on voting pools will allow for with Bitcoin.
You simply can't compare blockchain native bearer tokens to VISA.
It's an accident of history that a tiny sliver of the population is even *able* to pay for low value items quickly on the blockchain in face-to-face retail settings.

I expect lots of things, and because I enjoy speculating - I expect that I'll be rich. That doesn't mean it will *happen*. Let's not speculate, *and count on being right*. That's an utterly negligent way to build software.


First, have you heard the saying "**Fast, Cheap, Quality - Pick Two?**" Because it perfectly applies to blockchains just like it does every other product and service in the world. You want fast and cheap, AND quality? No, sorry, it's not happening. You can have fast and cheap blockchain transactions by bloating the ever loving piss out of the blockchain, sure - sacrificing its decentralization and quality. Or you can simply move your fast and cheap transactions to LightningVenmo to uphold the quality of the blockchain.
Second, resources are limited. *Water* is limited for example. People want cheap water just like they want cheap blockchains. I hope it never comes to this, but say we don't have enough water to go around - that doesn't mean we should dilute water with Mountain Dew so that more people can drink - that's not what people want from *water*.


Impoverished people need cheap transactions. I'm sure there will be a solution for that, like a Kongolese Coinbase - maybe even one on top of voting pools.


Sounds like an opportunity for you to create the Coinbase of your region.

 We're making major headway with Tor Browser, development is extremely active and security conscious. *Edward Snowden himself* has overtly recommended Tor Browser on multiple occasions. Yes, Tor isn't perfect. No, Tor isn't any worse than a VPN and is actually much better in a multitude of respects.
Tor, being free open source and easy to use, is certainly more than enough protection to browse the web and even watch Youtube videos. Just be sure to use https links everywhere and assume all non-https links are MITMd. All major websites offer https connections these days, so it's not really much of a problem.
VPNs are for people who don't care about thwarting NSA. Ultimately you're paying money for the VPN, and you can accomplish most of what a VPN does if not more with diligent use of Tor - for free and much more easily.
@_date: 2015-12-18 20:45:42
NSA has global taps on the internet, so you're not accomplishing much by merely redirecting your traffic from one place the NSA taps, to some other place the NSA taps.

The iPhone doesn't need liquidity on the market to have value and a network effect, which is self-reinforcing. Ever held an altcoin before? It sucks when your money constantly loses value and is atrociously illiquid and hypervolatile. Bitcoin is an order of magnitude safer to adopt than any altcoin.


LightningVenmo will offer you zero fee instant transactions, just click a button in your wallet to transfer over $300 or so, and you're golden. The PayPal of voting pools, and Coinbase offer similar functionality.
The Bitcoin blockchain is destined to become a [monetary base](






[Think of the Bitcoin blockchain as M0](


@_date: 2015-12-18 18:07:46
Starbucks gift card purchases don't need censorship resistance, and there's no reason why you couldn't make that purchase using your $300 balance on a Lightning powered Venmo, or a PayPal of voting pools. Either way you'd be able to buy it instantly and for zero fee.
@_date: 2015-12-21 01:18:57


This is a prediction, yet you're stating it as *fact*. You're speculating, *and counting on being right* - that's an utterly negligent way to build software.


Right, it's about protecting decentralization - who ever said anything about a business model for miners?
Decentralization is the only way for [Bitcoin - a money without government - to succeed against government-sanctioned monies](


And absolutely - Bitcoin *is* for everybody - but just about everyone can afford paying $5 on a $100+ transaction, and just about everyone in western nations pays bills over $100 from time to time. $5 fees in no way prevent everybody from "settling" on the blockchain. Anyone can pay $5, but hardly anyone can gain insider access to cushy private banking networks like SWIFT.
@_date: 2015-12-21 05:59:00
**Fast, Cheap, Quality - Pick Two**
When settlement is your product, you can have it Fast and Cheap, but only by cramming in both payments and settlements into the blockchain, bloating the blockchain and reducing its quality and accessibiliy for the whole ecosystem.
While we can make settlement equivalent to payment, that comes at the cost of decentralization, which is what the value of the vast quantities of BTC held in cold storage depend upon more than anything else.
How often does *gold* need to settle for its multi-*trillion* dollar market cap? 
And how many transactions per second can you do with gold bullion over Tor?
It's flat out **zero**.
Centralized payment systems are a dime a dozen - the future of blockchains simply isn't *low value payment processing*. We'll have Lightning for that. And you can argue the importance of blockchain 2.0 though you've chosen not to, but we have sidechains for that. We have voting pools for that. And blockchain 2.0 has no actual users anyway. Why should be making protocol level decisions around these special interests? If we're to listen to the Lightning FUDsters who are condemning it prematurely, then we should just fast track a 20 year economic plan and forget about the enormous gains in decentrailzation had from scaling with a block size an order of magnitude smaller than that required by BIP101.
With BTC, not only can you have finality of settlement anonymously over great distances, but if you're willing to *push a button* and deposit $300 on LightningVenmo, you can have *millions* of tps in those same scenarios and beyond.
@_date: 2015-12-21 06:15:50


Ceteris Paribus fallacy. Other things aren't equal in Bitcoin, because higher throughput comes at the cost of more bloat, creating industry-wide centralizing pressures.


It costs what exactly to join the private SWIFT banking network? Millions?
Conversely, with a strongly adopted Bitcoin fully decentralized, it costs you no more than $20 to settle on the chain. Compared to SWIFT $20 is undeniably an absolute *bargain*. This is the price point of *cheap vodka* we're talking about. You wouldn't want to settle on the blockchain every day, but that's a comparable cost to dispatching international wire transfers with your bank account, which certainly isn't enough to bar ordinary people from making international payments. Ordinary people will do it, just less often.


I hate to do this to you, but what did you actually pay for in BTC in 2015? What did you use these sweet, decentralized payment rails to accomplish?
Most Bitcoin investors are holders, and rarely if ever spend any BTC. If it's a rarity for most users, why should pretend it's worth sacrificing decentralization to make it easier to do? Feel free to chime in with your 2015 on-blockchain purchases, because I'm just not seeing who really suffers for $5 fees, especially if LightningVenmo is around.


Bitcoin isn't about trusting miners completely, in fact if we're going to fully trust miners for everything, we should just as well turn Bitcoin into a clearing house - with vetted miners you can *trust* to have your best interests in mind.
This is why we have full nodes - to keep them in check.


Again, $5 fees only price out people sending peanuts for pennies. It's really not the end of the world, and it's *undeniably not* once we have a Venmo style front end to Lightning.

Let's see what happens when IBD performance improves by 4X. In a couple years, with the blessing of Moore's Law, full nodes with lite modes could outright replace SPV on desktop. In the interim, we'll maybe gain the ability to push a button and put $300 on rails with a zero fee instant confirmation system that directly competes with Venmo. Or maybe not, and maybe we have to hard fork up. Say it ain't so!


If 7B people adopt Bitcoin tomorrow, what do you do? Do you point them to Coinbase? Do you raise block size to 8GB *counting* on blocks to be that big tomorrow?
The fact is we need to act as if Bitcoin is going to be a resounding success, while the state of hardware is baseline at least not much better than it is today. I mean, feel free to give yourself rosey scenarios - assume Moore's Law is your friend - I'd much rather hope for the best, prepare for the worst.

Governments are responsible for hundreds of millions of civilian deaths and the greatest atrocities in human history. That you trust the government to do what's right for humanity at large speaks *volumes* about you. Your point of view is mere speculation regardless.
I would urge you to look at what former NSA director General Keith Alexander said to lead Tor developer Jacob Appelbaum prior to [31C3]( in response to Jacob's question, "but what if the future Five Eyes Watchers aren't so nice to human rights", paraphrasing "[the Five Eyes] will never die".


Given to you by none other than the government, which controls the fiber optic cables that you take for granted.
Yes, let's trust a money without government, to the *government*. What could possibly go wrong?
Do you understand wars are fought over resources, and that US foreign policy goals explicitly include protecting the status of the Petro Dollar? Yet you suggest we trust the government to have Bitcoin's best interests in mind.


We already have a 1MB block that takes 30 seconds to verify on a *modern* quad core i7 processor. No, your used computer isn't going to be able to keep up with gigablocks.


The entire pretense of Bitcoin is that cypherspace is economically viable, that you don't need a government - or regulations - to conduct voluntary trade.

My expectations are and always have been to hodl BTC as a long term investment, but I won't speak for what your expectations are.
Fees are a variable cost for everyone, not a fixed cost. Fees could be *$20* and I would pay what? $300 per year or less to move coins in and out of LightningVenmo and Coinbase? That's about what a *gym membership* costs. BFD.

2008? 2010? That's over half a decade ago which is an eternity in Bitcoin terms. And to pretend like Satoshi would just "cast off" sidechains and Lightning network as fads while ignoring the opinions of the development community beggars belief.
Datacenters is not an ideal end state, it's something to be said to naysayers when backed into a corner with no other solutions. It's not the first solution, but the *last resort*.

The guy has a million bitcoins and hasn't touched them yet. If I had to guess, I'd say he's rather insecure about the innovations he sees running on altchains, and wants as much innovation to be denominated in BTC as possible. Sidechains allow for this and I see absolutely no reason for Satoshi not to be in favor of them.
Now, nobody thinks sidechains are a great solution to scalability, if that's what you're asking.
As for Lightning, again - nobody invests in BTC for the low fees. That's such a prevalent myth it's honestly infuriating to see it repeated ad nauseum by every last user. For example, imagine you had to deposit $300 worth of BTC into a special open source client side Bitcoin wallet to get access to zero fee instant transactions over Lightning. Is that really so bad? Do you *really* need fees to be zero on the main blockchain? Or do you just need to preserve the ability to make *some* transactions with zero fee? Because if so those transactions can certainly occur over Lightning.
@_date: 2015-12-20 22:02:41
We're in unanimous agreement that the block size limit eventually needs to be raised.
But nobody invests in Bitcoin for the low fees, and we've quite some time before fees are insurmountable for ordinary users.

Exactly right. For picture perfect payment processing you need a dedicated solution like LightningVenmo. For example, imagine in Breadwallet you tap a button, select an amount like $300, and hit ENTER and that becomes your LightningVenmo balance. You can then pay anyone else in the world who has a LightningVenmo account instantly and for near zero fee.
Another option would be a PayPal type solution but with voting pools so users don't trust any money to a third party.

Strengths | Cheaper, faster throughput on main blockchain for payments and blockchain 2.0 | Higher quality main blockchain - lighter weight, max agility, max privacy, max decentralization
Weaknesses | Slashes quality of main blockchain because places trust into Corporations for running full nodes | Higher price of main blockchain forces fast and cheap payments to look elsewhere like Venmo of Lightning or voting pools for sub-$100 txs, forces blockchain 2.0 to sidechains or voting pools
Opportunities | Cheap payment processing? Blockchain 2.0 on the main chain instead of sidechains or voting pools? | SPV obsolete on home PC, Blockchain.info block explorer and charts obsolete on home PC, [Bitcoin as a base money](
Threats | Altcoins with more decentralization win out over Bitcoin since nobody invests in BTC in the first place for the low fee payment processing nor does anyone actually use blockchain 2.0 despite what astroturfers say on Reddit | Altcoins with higher throughput on chain win out because blockchain 2.0 is important even though they have no users today maybe they gain users in the future and maybe Lightning Venmo is a flop

Once Bitcoin has Lightning, BBQCoin will too. That doesn't mean BBQCoin will gain a followingfor its "low fees" and "high throughput".
For example, go hold a hypervolatile illiquid altcoin like BBQCoin starting today. In a few weeks after losing your money in the markets you can explain why liquidity and network effect aren't critical features to money. It sure is amazing when your investments hold their value, hey it's almost as if that's an explicit goal for most investors. Not to lose your ass in the markets is quite a bit more important than BBQCoin's low fees and throughput.
