I don’t want to register. Could you cut and past or link a different sauce?

I was where you are 3 years ago. You have looked in all the right places but drawn different conclusions. Good luck.

I have £10k in Coinbase and want to hold my keys. Thinking Ledger Nano S/X - am I on the right lines? Will Coinbase allow me to withdraw to this?
I’m sure I could google but you guys seem cool

Do you have sauce for other stories please? Thanks

Interesting, haven’t done too much research thus far but was being swayed to the Ledger. Which Ledger did you have?

Lolz. Just a realist, the system/ power brokers/ sheep won’t handle such an abrupt change as ‘the end of fiat’ anytime soon. Eventually, maybe. 
The flows out of China, Iran, Venezuela, following political/ fiscal unrest interests me more, those are perhaps better anecdotal evidence of BTC’s utility vs an overly zealous centralised authority. Don’t know how to track this though, does anyone have good articles?

Yep - HODL bitcoin, was swayed toward the Nano S for this reason. Food for thought...

I knew someone would pick that up, haha but seriously for the average joe who suffers id fraud or hacking, banks offer far more protection. Convenience and comfort is the name of the game for most of society. 
Its just that some people have gotten pretty good at gaming the fiat/ fractional reserve system. Greedy people will always exist. 
The black market/ fraud is also reason to support BTC. Total market cap of the illicit drugs trade is estimated at 1.6-2.2 trillion, morals aside, thats some strong motivation right there. if all that trade went to BTC overnight...

The first stock markets were established in the 1600 by the Dutch East India Company, there have been bubbles and crashes since before that BUT I agree. I think its placed itself as a store of value as opposed to a currency but in relative terms it is still valuable. I am prepared to be wrong and I have my money where my mouth is.
There is a romance in investing in something that rallies against the bank/central bank cartel. I’d prefer that to be part of my legacy for future generations. 
If your planning a ‘traditional’ route to retirement then, no, I wouldn’t rely on BTC (and I am not either) but in terms of an effort to perpetuate a new innovative, neutral and secure way for global commerce then, yes, why not. 
I appreciate your perspective and I have no

Thanks - going to read these on my commute. Definitely feels like some serious disruption is not only likely but required at this point, how the chips will fall is anyones guess...

Normie here. This seems very significant, first rate cut in a decade? Educate me:
@_date: 2019-07-08 22:02:45
Done x

A very long time, its well known in the banking community. Wonder how many shady deals they have done to keep afloat thus far...
Not sure I can stomach another collapse just yet, I’m recently invested in real estate :/

Notice that i referenced the average joe/ society not me personally. 
Its all good like minded people agreeing that the world should be different, but it isn’t and the culture will take a long time to change. Think of smartphones, they work, they give people what they want. People didn’t gain a collective conciounsness that smartphones will inprove society.  BTC will have to become much more accessible/ stable/ safe and easy for mass adoption. I believe it will.

As a broad point on centralised/ decentralised thats fine but its not quite that simple though is it. Banks as institutions are ingrained in society they also actively work to prevent fraud and are regulated, far from perfect but at this point neither is BTC as a means of currency.  
If banks collapsed tomorrow, we would have far greater problems than wondering how high BTC will go.

Edit: I’m working on this, in a better mindset/ position to do so now
