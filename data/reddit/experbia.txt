The bitcoin miners would complain about the house being too quiet.

That would be awesome!  The idea that something like that could be so easy to implement with bitcoin is very awesome, too.

Instead of just answering no, I'll explain why Bitcoin is not vulnerable:
*Disclaimer: this is based on /my/ understanding of how the disruption service works, as per a previous thread and reading previous articles on it.*
This startup specifically appears to target BitTorrent traffic.  Torrent clients have a kind of "peer trust" metric - if a peer in a network constantly delivers 'bad data' or doesn't deliver data at all, other peers will disconnect from it.
This is functionality inherent to bittorrent and torrent clients.  To the best of my knowledge, Bitcoin has no such functionality.
Again: to the best of my knowledge, this startup's work effectively "spoofs" Bittorrent peers to deliver bad data and force peers to disconnect from each other, dissolving the network.
If anyone has more specific information, or corrections, please let me know.  I don't intend to misinform.

Fuck yes, Nutty Bars.

I'm still looking through it (about half way through part 3), but the basic idea as I understand it so far would be very interesting.  I can foresee it being a much more generic system (not just 'predicting' deaths of people, but any other events that would need doing)
Very interesting, though.. I'll keep reading :)
EDIT: I finished reading it, it was an absolutely fascinating read.  I highly suggest that everyone here at least reads the first section at LEAST, then decide if you'd like to read more.  This idea is new to me, and surprisingly well thought-out.  I'm not sure what I think of seeing an actual implementation of the system quite yet but I think I agree with the author- it might end up being only a matter of time.

I understand this is a very good card to mine with..?  Overclocked and properly cooled, what kind of hashrate does this card generally yield?  My google-fu is not as strong as I would like to claim.  I'm seeing numbers around 280 Mh/s - is this accurate?
I'm thinking I should invest in a little bit of mining hardware here.. but I'm not sure how quickly it will be worth it.  Can anyone lend some advice? :)  I would appreciate it!
* EDIT - nevermind :) I had somehow completely missed the mining hardware comparison Rawlsdeep linked.

Thank you!  Somehow I'd managed to NOT bump into that.  &lt;3

Seconded!  This is a great idea.  I'll also remotely buy someone a cup of coffee :)
If just because that's totally a cool-sounding thing to do.  The fact that some guy in Portland, Oregon, US COULD buy coffee for a stranger in Northern Ireland.. is neat!

This happened to me as well, exactly like this.
I sent an email to them but I'm sure they're.. plenty overloaded.  The confirmation hasn't popped up again so I'm assuming it took...
