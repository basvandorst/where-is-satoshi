Question is, what did you buy with them? ��

Blockchain games are more serious than they might seem.
Most blockchain games are currently selling overpriced virtual tanks, kittens, and so on.
We wanted to build a game with a connection to the real world.
Blocklord allows you to own, personalize and trade blocks on the real world map.
You can buy the block where you were born or where you work, and personalize them with your own images and links.
While you own a block, nobody else can advertise on it, or change it in any way.
Today, we are launching on Product Hunt.
We aim to bring more people to the blockchain community and decentralised applications closer to the mainstream markets.
To celebrate, we are now live on Product Hunt  and let us know what you think!

From the launch post:
Blocklord is Ethereum's 1st Decentralized Planet Earth where every corner of the planet has been tokenised on the Ethereum Blockchain, and can be customised and traded.
Blocklord subdivides and tokenises every corner of planet Earth. You can own, customise and trade blocks of land on the blockchain.
Each token, or block, can be personalised with image, text, a link to your personal or commercial website an so on.
You could own Times Square, the Tour Eiffel, your office or the place where you met your significant other, and customise each block to your liking, leaving your mark forever on the blockchain.
Blocks can be re-sold or rented out to tenants who might want to temporarily advertise on your blocks, generating real world income.
"You can earn value in 3 different ways. 1) You can decide to resell a block for a price of your choice (e.g. you buy for 0.1 ETH and can sell it for 0.12ETH for 20% profit) 2) Other players can decide to buy you out without your consent, they would need to pay at least double what you paid for, this is to retain liquidity in case somebody bought, say the White House, and then decided not to play the game anymore. 3) You can rent your block, for a daily fee another player can decide to put their data on the block. Imagine a coffee chain would want to advertise a campaign on the blocks where their premises are.
What do you guys think? How would you use it? Any feedback would be great!
