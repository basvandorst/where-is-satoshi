In this new age of cryptocurrency or what I call ‘world currency’, most fiat currency rules-of-thumb don’t apply. Yes, of coarse there’s crap out there, but for all the honest Robinhood-like cryptocurrency efforts, the ones who want to truly enhance Sotashi’s vision I’m confident their experiments will rise to the top. It’s better to have an ecosystem of global decentralized cryptocurrencies; There’s power in numbers. Altcoins will not only save bitcoin, but will make bitcoin stronger. The internationally unbanked and those countries with unreliable governments and currency will lead the way to massive adoption, kinda like the adoption of the internet once upon a time.

During a bursting bubble or hypothetical crash of bitcoin, it is fasting to transfer value to altcoins, rather than a fiat currency. With hundreds of millions of investment dollars and technologies like the Lightning Network, transfer speeds and the blockchain overall will improve dramatically. Bitcoin loosing it's current value in short term may happen, but will not detour it's rise in the long time. Altcoins will ultimately save bitcoin.

Well, Bob... that is your name right? Bob? You might try asking Ray on IG, Tw, etc., rather than assuming the worst of people. Bob.
