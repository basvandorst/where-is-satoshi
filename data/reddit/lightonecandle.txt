Question: I have a number of tips that I know I made, but that have not shown up in Changetip. Should I assume that they will disappear, or that they somehow got lost in the shuffle?
Also: thanks for all the work.
@_date: 2014-11-11 01:52:49
Why would you think this? And how could you 'display' it this way to strangers?
Without my first tip, I would never have figured out how this works. It was 100 bits (three cents), but its size didn't matter, and it never occurred to me to interpret the generosity of strangers as a sign that they didn't care about what they were giving.

The key is to do this only when you have some actual evidence that the person is scamming people. Saying "something seems fishy to me", and using your sense of fishiness as 'evidence' of wrongdoing, is making an accusation against another human being on the basis of no evidence at all.

It comes from the tipper's wallet, and goes to the tippee's. Since a couple of people have tipped you, you have probably set up a Changetip wallet (very easy!), and can see those tips in it. Then you can follow the instructions given below and tip other people, and watch your balance get smaller. (But it's so much fun that that doesn't matter.)

I'm one of the people you need to convince, since at the moment I don't agree with you. But what I get from reading your comments is not a set of reasons to accept your views, but a lot of insults directed at your opponents.

Hmm: two notes. First, you have to say something like this: 80 bits private. 
Note the *two* slashes, one before the u, one after. Second, my original tip did not go through in its entirety. I suspect that this is because I said something other than -- well, the amount that preceded my invocation of the Changetip bot. When it locates two things that might be the amount it's suppose to tip, it defaults to the smaller one. I suspect 'few cents' was the culprit. I also think that it doesn't search outside the paragraph in which its name appears, which is why I'm saying most of this in a separate paragraph.
That said: this is all about Changetip. Changetip is fun! But it's not bitcoin. Thanks for the tip, but I'd keep your bits and play around with them with your son. You might try creating a wallet on Circle.com (or Coinbase), which you can transfer these bits into for free.

I think you are conflating two things. (a) Is saving bad for the economy (i.e., the national economy, the global economy)? No, especially if there are good investment vehicles so that people who save money even when they themselves do not plan to e.g. open a business can make their money available for investment by people who will. 
(b) Is it good for *the Bitcoin economy*? This is a different question. Bitcoin has a few problems at present, and one of them is lack of acceptance by many of the people one might want to have transactions with. This is an impediment to its wider use, and it's an impediment that most national currencies do not face, and so do not have to surmount. 
If you think that "the Bitcoin economy" will be helped by making Bitcoin more widely accepted, and that one way to achieve this is to show merchants, corporations, service providers, etc. that it is worth their while to start accepting Bitcoin, then I think it really is important to actually spend it. 
Moreover, there are not a lot of opportunities to invest in Bitcoin, so it's not true, as it normally is in (say) dollars, that by saving you are helping the economy to grow.

Tips are meant as gestures of appreciation for your server. If you intend your tip to serve this function, you should tip in a way that will not require most servers to figure out what bitcoin is, how to set up a wallet, how to transfer this bitcoin into it, where it's possible to spend it and how one does that, etc.
What it would convey to me, if I were your server (and I once did this for a living), is that you're a lot more concerned with bitcoin evangelism than with actually giving a tip to the person who has served you; that even a tip is all about your agenda, not  about, you know, actually *tipping someone.*

I would think that that would be a spectacularly dumb thing for a business to do just now. In addition to all the other hard things about creating a profitable business, you get to have speculation on a very volatile currency as well -- and speculation that ensures that if the price of BTC goes down, what you get for your product goes down, whereas if the price of BTC goes up, your goods might be priced out of the market.
This wouldn't be true if everything were priced in BTC. But it's not, and businesses have to function in a world in which many of their suppliers, customers, employees, etc. work in fiat. It just wouldn't make sense for them to adopt a fixed BTC price.

Look: I like bitcoin. But inflation is what happens when you need more of a given currency to buy the same amount of goods. When the value of BTC goes down, that's inflation. And BTC has had a lot more inflation than most major currencies in the last year.
@_date: 2014-12-11 16:26:20
There are lots of different kinds of wallets. You already have one on Changetip if you collected your tip. Unless the tip was insanely large, that's fine for now. In the meanwhile, you can research various alternatives. 
Web-based wallets like Circle and Coinbase are easy and convenient, but have the disadvantage that you're trusting those companies with your BTC. Circle, at least, has two-factor authentication and (best I can tell) decent security. (Don't know Coinbase, since I don't use it.)
Cold storage means: a wallet that's not accessible by hackers. Trezor; paper wallets (but beware of e.g. throwing them away, sending them through the wash, etc. Hackers are not the only danger in the world),  etc.
In my opinion (which you should take for the little it's worth), the amount of trouble you go to to secure your BTC should depend on how much you have. Reading this sub, one can get the impression that everyone should take the kinds of security precautions appropriate for, say, the keys to the nuclear arsenal. This makes sense if you are keeping substantial amounts of money in BTC. But if you're not, you can get by with less.
@_date: 2014-11-02 17:30:23

@_date: 2014-11-11 04:49:51
I'd ask yourself what your goals are. If you value security, BTC is probably not your best bet. (Look at a chart of its price over time; there's a *lot* of volatility, and you could lose a lot of money.) On the other hand, if you don't need to rely on this, that's a different story.

@_date: 2014-11-18 01:21:10
I think that what I said might not conflict with what you said, but it does mean that some of your statements are misleading. I.e.: "After this measure goes into effect, when a bank goes bust, your deposits in that bank get effectively converted to "shares" of the bankrupt bank." This is not true of "your deposits"; just of "your deposits over $250,000", which is, for most people, *all* of their deposits. Likewise, "You, the depositor, now legally classified in the same risk category as regular stockholders of the bank, get whatever is left over. To put it in pedestrian terms: you get dick." This should read: "You, the depositor, get your entire balance if it's less than $250,000; if it's more than that, you get $250,000, and the rest of your balance is now legally classified... etc." Again, for most people, that means: you do not get dick; you get all your money. For the rest, it means: you get $250,000, and what on earth were you doing keeping that much money in a (single) bank account?"
Bank runs: they were caused by the fear of losing your deposits. If there was any hint that your bank was going to go under, you had to get them out or risk losing everything. Now that the overwhelming majority of people's deposits are fully insured, why would they need to run to the bank and withdraw their savings?

Think about exactly how this works. You are Russian, you want to keep your money in something more stable than the ruble. 
First question: is that something bitcoin? Whatever my own views about bitcoin, if I were looking for something *simply as a store of value*, it would not be my first choice. I'd much rather have dollars, or Euros, or any currency that is reasonably stable over time.
Second question: suppose you decided to try to exchange your rubles for bitcoin. *Someone has to be on the other end of that trade.* And at the moment, that someone is probably going to want a pretty serious premium for holding rubles. (This is of course true for any currency.)
Third, in order for this to cause not just a minor uptick in prices but a rally, the number of people who manage to get through the problems in the first two questions would have to be a lot larger than seems at all likely.
tl;dr: no.
@_date: 2014-12-30 06:47:53
Some parts of this are good. (I'd be fine with banning tips under, oh, 50 bits.) But a lot of this misses the point of Changetip.
It's not only about tipping money per se. Changetip allows people who are interested in Bitcoin to play with a tiny amount of it, an amount that's too small to make them get paranoid about using it.
Take me, for example. I had been lurking here for maybe a month, just being curious. But whenever I read people's explanations of how to secure BTC, how to buy it, etc., it seemed very complicated. Who could I trust to buy it from? Especially since I am very reluctant to give out my bank account info, and even more reluctant to rely on the kindness of strangers, even if I meet them in a public location? What should I do to secure my bitcoin, even if I figure out how to acquire it? -- I am not a computer geek or a crypto expert. To me, this was all very daunting.
Then one day, a couple of months ago, someone (u/cherker?) announced a giveaway: 100 bits to anyone who asked. I created a Reddit account and asked. With my 100 bits -- all of three cents!!! -- I could see how this worked in a way I wouldn't have been able to do by reading the (very good) stuff in the sidebar. It mattered that I didn't have to give out my bank account info to get it. And it also mattered that it was such a tiny sum that I didn't care whether I lost it or not. 
When people say: oh, it just devalues bitcoin if you toss it around in tips, or: who would care about such a tiny sum of money?!, I think: they are missing the point. I wouldn't have bothered to collect my 100 bit tip, let alone to go to the trouble of creating a Reddit account, for the sake of getting 3 cents. But i did both those things for the sake of figuring out how to use Bitcoin. 
Imho, removing *all* the barriers to entry for the bitcoin-curious is one of the great uses of Changetip. And ignoring this is a very serious mistake.

One key word here is "invest". If you're buying bitcoin to purchase something immediately, you're not investing, just spending. (Though it's also true that you shouldn't *spend* more than you can afford to.) If you're putting money in bitcoin to invest, however, you should be aware of the fact that it has historically been very volatile. Here's a chart; set the timeframe to 'all' and watch it go from zero to a whole lot to about a third of a whole lot very quickly.
Lots of people in this sub think that bitcoin has a lot of upside potential. They may be right. But when I imagine putting my life savings in something whose trajectory to date looks like that chart, I imagine being very, very, very worried all the time. And I hate being worried.
I also imagine the possibility of *losing* those life savings. Which is even worse. Because while I can tell myself stories about why bitcoin might go up and stories about why it might go down, I really have no idea, nor do any of us. 
That's why I wouldn't invest more in a very volatile product than I can afford to lose. Because I might, in fact, lose it.
@_date: 2014-11-18 18:03:40
The law has to work this way, but you get to choose which of the many legal things you think you ought to do. One of them is asking whether the BTC were sold by mistake, and if so, returning them. This is your choice, not the law's.

Best I can tell, if you link a bank to Coinbase, you can buy through Coinbase. And if you link your bank account to Changetip, you can buy through Changetip.

Circle has no fees if you link a bank account to it, and use that account to buy or sell. Circle itself doesn't have any fees if you use a credit card, but the credit cards sometimes have their own fees, since some of them treat buying BTC as a cash advance rather than a purchase. Since I use Circle, I don't know much about Coinbase. 
Exchanges generally do have fees. They are primarily used by people who trade BTC on the market. You should probably not do this for a while. (It's a lot like gambling, unless you are a very, very experienced trader.)
@_date: 2014-11-10 22:58:49
Still, remember: we were all n00bs once. I set up my account maybe a week ago, on the first of the tipping threads, because I had been lurking for a while and wanted to see how this worked, exactly. (Since it was the first of these threads, I had no idea it was about to go viral, and all I really wanted was the first 100 bits, so that I could move it around and stuff.) But it would have been easy to conclude that I was a sockpuppet or something, I suppose.  100 bits private
@_date: 2014-12-11 18:35:12
Seriously: I think that it takes a certain amount of time to really figure security out, at least if you don't already do this stuff for a living. They'd probably be much better off doing something easy and reasonably safe when they're just starting out and (probably) don't have much in BTC than they would be deferring getting into BTC while they sort through the pros and cons of various storage plans. 
Your security needs are proportionate to the amount of BTC you have. If someone just got tipped a few bits, it's overkill to tell them about the pros and cons of different kinds of cold storage.

"Think about being poor. If prices are coming down it is much easier to get back on your feet. If prices are rising and rising you need more and more just to stay even."
This is true only if prices go down but wages remain constant. If prices and wages go down, this will not help the poor at all. On the contrary: people who have money before the deflation starts will find their money worth more and more over time. 
Moreover, deflation seriously affects economic growth, and with it the likelihood that a poor person will be able to find and keep a job.

Look at the history of European countries' national debts over time. They were much less well governed than we were back in, say, the 18th and 19th centuries, and yet somehow they had debts that, as a percentage of GDP, were often a lot larger than ours, and most did not collapse.

I would think so. At any rate, if they set up a Changetip account, they will presumably figure out that the tip is in BTC. After that, the worst that could happen is that the bot collects their tip for them and they are pleasantly surprised when they check the balance.

Russia is trying to prevent a collapse of the ruble. Interest rate hikes are one way to do this (make it more attractive to invest in Russia), but if they don't work, capital controls, preventing people from transforming their rubles into anything else (or: preventing it over a given amount, etc.) are an obvious next step. Not a good one.

Coinbase and Circle are on the web. They can keep your bitcoin in a wallet for you once you buy it. But because this doesn't give you total control (you have to trust them not to e.g. go bankrupt, run off with your money, etc.), you might want to transfer the funds to your own wallet, which *is* under your control.

Circle does not have fees if you link a bank account, though its exchange rate is sometimes different from what you'd get on an exchange, and some people think that's a fee in disguise.

But then how do I zoom out? -- I've tried all the Zoom-related commands in my browser (Safari). As I expected, they make *everything* smaller, which leaves the candlesticks at maybe 4x their normal width, as opposed to 8 or 12x, but makes the text, orders, etc. microscopic. I've also tried all the settings I can find on BitCoinWisdom, and basically everything (in my browser and on the page) that seems like it might possibly be relevant.

The general point being: if you think that 'liberty' means being able to get where you want to go in one piece, then you can ask yourself whether traffic laws help or hinder liberty. Likewise, if you think this way about liberty, you can ask yourself whether the laws governing private property help or hinder liberty. 
You might then also wonder why it's not as much of a problem, in terms of your liberty, if you are killed by a pathogen as it is if you are killed by a murderer, and you might then come to support the CDC. Or, for that matter, Obamacare.
But if you think that liberty just means freedom from interference, then I think that both the traffic laws and the laws prohibiting people from e.g. theft are unjustifiable.

I think it's wrong to keep it, at least if you know whose key it is. If you don't, you should try to find out; if you fail, I think keeping the BTCs is OK. 
What bothers me about the thread linked to by the OP is the idea that "the question inserts morality into a system where there is none." I suppose the BTC, not being a person, does not have a morality. Neither do dollars or Euros. But the idea that that absolves *me*, an actual human being, from having to live by *my own* moral standards is absurd, and trying to justify this on the grounds that the person who lost the keys is responsible for his or her own conduct just makes it sillier. (Yes, that person is responsible for his or her own conduct; by the same token, I am responsible for mine, and should do what I think is right, whether or not the Bitcoin protocols require it.)
When people in my neighborhood find keys that someone has dropped, they ask around to see whether someone can identify the keys, and if so, they return them. I don't see that this is different.

Seriously: we do. If everyone who owns BTC did not want to sell until we got to X, no one would be able to buy below X. The fact that the price is where it is means that enough people are willing to sell at (checking now) 419.49 to make the market clear.
(I feel like I'm just being dense, but: *of course* BTC owners, along with could-be buyers, set the price.)

As of Dec. 31 2013, it had 47.2 billion, which is .79% of insured deposits. That it's less than 1% would be a big problem if all the insured banks go under at once, but this didn't come close to happening even in 2009. Also, when a bank fails, the FDIC is not on the hook for *all* the insured deposits. It goes in, secures the bank's funds etc., and its funds only kick in to make up the difference, if any. 
Imho, .79% is too little. (Also in the law's humble opinion: they're going for 2%.) But it's not "broke".

Hi -- I'm a progressive Democrat who cares a lot about war, privacy, and civil liberties. Back when Bush was President, I spent a lot of time wondering where all the Republicans I'd heard talking about liberty were, now that we had apparently embraced torture and mass surveillance of Americans without anything resembling probable cause.

I have no clue about C&amp;M and his son and his son's teacher: as I said in another thread, I don't know him outside of Reddit, nor do I think I need to.

It's important to take one's own responsibility seriously, and that means not just that the original owner should, but that I should as well.

Not really. I'm not emotionally charged about the fact that I got scammed out of a few cents. I'm bothered by the idea that someone thinks I ought to change the way I live my life because, OMG, I got scammed out of a few cents. 
As I see it, I have decided that the risk of being scammed out of a few cents is worth it. That's my business, not anyone else's. And I'm much happier being me, the person who gets scammed out of a few cents but also helps other people who need it, than I would be being the person who thinks: Hah! I'll show those people who tip a few cents!!!!! 
Do I care whether someone might pull my heartstrings along with a million others? Not really, not if they pull my heartstrings for 100 bits. Might I do things differently if there were "millions of eyeballs"? Maybe; even now I'm much more likely to give to people who are not the Internet Flavor of the Week.

@_date: 2014-11-07 05:35:00
You know what? I had a zero day account a few days ago. Why? Because I had been lurking, but never felt like commenting; I was just learning stuff. I got an account to get a tip, on what seems to be the first tip thread, just so I could learn some more, the way you learn by doing things like actually setting up a wallet, sending money -- and small amounts work just as well as large ones for this purpose -- to it, etc.
We all start sometime. That doesn't make us bots or scammers or whoever it is that you think we are.
@_date: 2014-12-08 04:05:07
First, what makes you think I'm head over heels in love with bitcoin? You don't know me, and you don't know why I'm here. You certainly don't know anything about my "indoctrinated eyes", or about what I wanted to hear. (Why not reference my senses of smell, touch, and taste while you're at it?) Fwiw. I am a lot more interested in helping nerdy kids than I am in bitcoin.
Second, I didn't think that the thing with CyanideandMadness was "all but proven". Here I had the advantage of having interacted with C&amp;M before this happened. He had always been a decent guy, and someone who gave a lot more than he got. I don't form opinions where I don't have evidence, so I have not said one way or the other whether I actually believe C&amp;M. But I do know that he is really, really unlikely to have been doing this just for the tips, unless he was doing one of those very, very long cons in which you act like a decent person for *months* in order to lull people into complacency. That seems like a lot of trouble to go to for the sums in question, especially since there's no obvious way to tell what will go viral here and what won't. 
Third: yes, the poster typed the wrong syntax for changetip. He did that to me, in fact, and I noticed. *Total giveaway!!!* It's not as though no one does that irl, and it's also not as though everyone constantly rechecks Reddit to see whether their tips went through. Some people have lives.
I don't actually know what this sub was like before Changetip, since Changetip was what got me into it. I had been lurking for a bit, but I only actually signed up for a Reddit account when someone offered 100 bits to anyone who commented. With that 100 bits, I got to play around: I created another wallet, transferred my 100 bits to it, and in that way learned more about how this works than I would have done in a year of reading. So when someone else came along who wanted to learn about it, I tipped the 100 bits back. Whoop de do. 
Also, it's 'head over heels.'

For me, it was a chicken and egg problem. I did not really understand bitcoin (not the basic conceptual points, but things like: how do wallets work? How do you set this up? Is it secure? Etc.) I do not like to give out credit card or bank info when I don't understand something. But I was not going to understand it until I had the ability to play around, set up a wallet (circle; was that a good choice?), transfer things into it, etc. 
The fact that I did not have to use my credit card and bank info, but instead just got 100 bits from a total stranger, made me figure out a lot of this, in a way I wouldn't have felt able to do otherwise. My 100 bits let me work out the wallet stuff, the transferring stuff, etc., without having to enter personal data. It got me over the chicken/egg problem in a way I probably would not have otherwise.
So: thanks. ;)
@_date: 2014-11-10 03:22:02
As I understand it, increases in the monetary base are inflationary only if the money is actually spent. Given a shock to demand like, oh, I dunno, a massive financial crisis that leaves all sorts of ordinary people jobless, banks with crippled balance sheets, companies without customers, etc., people/companies/banks naturally want to hold onto their money and/or pay down their debts, in order to protect themselves. They are, therefore, much, much less likely to spend it. But since one person's spending is another person's income, when everyone spends less, it means that it is exactly as if a whole lot of money had vanished from the supply of money that's out there, since it is no longer being spent, but being hoarded.
You ask why money is not flying out the door in the form of cheap credit. I'm not sure where you're from (nor am I asking ;) ), but in most of the developed world, credit is, in fact, *very* cheap. The Federal Reserve rate is barely above zero. Mortgages are at prices that would have been unthinkably low for most of my lifetime. The problem is that lots of people have impaired credit, and among those who don't, the willingness to borrow is a lot lower than it would normally be. (See above for why.) Exceptions like the mortgage refinance boom largely support this general picture: the point of refinancing at today's low, low rates is not to borrow more, but to lower the costs of a loan you already have.

True. I haven't been around long enough to say, but I do know that when I applied for a flair, I had a very short history and while I had been tipping some people, I was (at the time, meaning hours after my first tip) more preoccupied with trying to figure out how to transfer my first 100 bits (!!!) to my new wallet (!!!!!). 
Which is all to say: he was looser then, at least with me. I got my first tip in the first viral tipping thread; since then there have been a lot of people just begging. I don't mind that much, myself, and am baffled by the threads of outrage. (I mean: outrage over the odd penny here and there?) That said, I can imagine that if I were in his shoes, the general phenomenon might have annoyed me.

So just to be clear: we all believe in the eventual heat death of the universe, right? (Unless it is preempted by some previous cataclysm, like the Apocalypse. Point being: at some point the universe either ends or stops being able to sustain life.) Any life-ending cataclysm implies that all currencies will fail. The US Dollar is a currency. Thus, it will eventually fail. QED. 
But presumably the interesting question is not: will the heat death of the universe or something of that magnitude overtake human life? It is: will the US Dollar collapse for some economic or political reason? Will hyperinflation destroy it? Will the USA be conquered by some other country that imposes a new currency on us? Maybe Martians? Etc. 
Which is to say: NO ONE is saying that the US Dollar is immortal, unending, impervious to cataclysm.
I assume that the US Dollar will fail eventually. The Roman Empire looked fairly solid for centuries, but it eventually fell, and its currency went with it. I just don't see this happening any time soon, at least so long as various politicians don't keep flirting with default.

Point of clarification: in Jason King's response, he writes: 
"More so, I have deep reservations about being a registered charity. I think that asking permission from anyone to do good is ridiculous. Had we not purchased Satoshi Forest we would probably not have registered as an organization. Our organization would continue to feed the homeless no matter what our legal status."
The Florida statute does not say that anyone has to ask permission to do good. It says that you have to ask permission in order to solicit funds that you describe as being for charitable purposes.
Nothing in that statute prohibits Jason King from doing good by himself. Nothing about it prohibits him from raising money by other means (working, winning the lottery, what have you), and using that money for charitable purposes. It only prohibits hm from soliciting money which he claims will be used for charitable purposes without registering. (I imagine that his dissolution would also prevent his contributors from deducting their contributions on their taxes.)
This is a statute aimed at preventing fraud, not a statute that requires that you register in order to feed the homeless.

So: now that you've received a tip, you have presumably created a Changetip account. From now on, that account will automatically receive your tips. You don't have to do anything. 
To tip someone else, type some sum plus  -- the name of the bot that does the tipping. 
Be aware that there are "monikers": words or phrases that the bot interprets as sums of money. If you put one of these in the same paragraph as the bot's name, it will tip the person you're replying to. A list of the monikers is here: 
So if you type the bot's name (see above, in a different paragraph so that I don't inadvertently make a huge tip), plus, say, "drinks" or "Happy Hour", or just "100 bits", the bot will try to figure out what sort of tip you were intending to give. If you mention two things that might be tip amounts, it will normally default to the smaller sum, to avoid inadvertent catastrophes. (I.e.: if you say: "Hey, I was just heading out for drinks, but before I go, here's 100 bits", and then mention the bot's name, it will tip 100 bits (3.5 cents) rather than "drinks" ($5).)
Hope this helps.

Actually, the way things work today is that if your bank deposit is insured and you cannot get it back from the bank, the government will reimburse you for it. All deposits up to $250,000 are insured in the US. The safety of deposits under this amount is not affected by this.
Until the creation of the FDIC in 1933, your deposits were *not* insured in this way, and if your bank went under, you could lose everything. This is why there were bank runs. (Think: It's A Wonderful Life.) And it's why bank runs were such a huge source of instability for the banking system: the mere suspicion that a bank might be about to go under, even if that suspicion was completely groundless, could spark a run, which in turn could make that bank go under. 
The possibility of losing your money if your bank goes bankrupt is in no way new. On the contrary, what's new (as of 1933) is the fact that if you have less than $250k in your bank account, you *won't* lose everything. And that remains completely unchanged.

Presumably, the point was that since nightengale's mortgage is denominated in dollars, and will continue to be so denominated, if the dollar loses value, his or her mortgage payments will become negligible. This happens in countries that experience hyperinflation: people who took out loans for e.g. a very nice house find themselves with mortgage payments that are worth a few pennies in some non-inflated currency.

This article is just wrong. Part of the "lost wealth" is wealth that people would have had if the Fed had set interest rates higher than it did. I could just as well say that $10,000 in the bank would have "lost" even more money because the Fed could, after all, have set interest rates at 20%, or 1000%, or any number you please. 
The rest of the "lost wealth" is, according to the author, "lost" because of inflation. The author thinks that the official inflation statistics are set way too low, and so the "real" inflation rate is more like 10%. But it's not just the government that thinks that inflation is more like 2%; other sources do as well. (E.g., MIT's Billion Prices Project, which monitors a much larger set of prices than the government.  )
If you start out by assuming that the interest that would be generated by an arbitrarily chosen higher interest rate counts as "lost", and then assume that the inflation rate is 5x higher than it actually seems to be, you can come up with all sorts of figures about "lost wealth". But that doesn't make it so.

I am not a handwriting expert. If you want one, don't listen to me. I also didn't read the original post last night, other than to glance at the image and think: huh. Pretty odd for a teacher to write. But then, some teachers are odd. (Not because of any views I have on BTC, but because I am a teacher, and when a student puts effort into an assignment and gets the facts basically right, you *never* give that student a zero, especially not on the basis of your own views. Fifth grade is not about learning telepathy so that you can agree with your teacher; it's about developing skills, like research and writing and critical thinking.)
When I looked at the image again after opening this thread, I thought: I don't really see the similarity at all. And I was going to write (and still believe) that it's pretty ironic that the people who are leaping to the conclusion that this is a fraud are doing so on the basis of a random person on the internet saying something that is not in any way obvious. I mean: people are saying that the people who believed the original post are too gullible, on the basis of this? 
But then I realized that the person who originally posted was CyanideandMadness. To be clear: I don't know C&amp;M in real life. For all I know, he could be Charlie Manson writing from his prison cell, or Pope Francis having a laugh, or an unusually intelligent basset hound, or, well, anyone. But I have interacted with him a bit elsewhere, and unless he's playing a really, really, REALLY long con, the kind that involves acting like a decent and generous person for months, he's not the sort of person who would be doing this for tips. He's just not. 
But then, why believe me? I'm just some random person on the internet as well.

Just for example, in medieval Britain, which was freer than a lot of other places, any able-bodied man of working age could be *compelled* to work, and the law capped the wages he could be paid. (This was in response to the Black Death, which led to a shortage of labor.) The penalty for refusing was prison. If you quit your job you were, again, subject to imprisonment. The term of employment was specified by statute, and leaving before that term was up, for any reason, was a breach of contract punishable by prison.
I chose Britain on purpose, because it's *not* an extreme case, like Russia. We are very, very free compared to the vast majority of people living in Britain when it was a functioning, not a ceremonial, monarchy.

I mean: think about the mental model people often have of inflation: if there are two people, one of whom has a candy bar and the other of whom has a dime, and there are no other goods, the candy bar will cost a dime. But if the second person finds another dime, the price of the candy bar will just go up, and the person who found the dime will not have gained any actual purchasing power.
This simple model (which is, yes, I do know this, *much too simple*; I'm just using it as an illustration here) obviously assumes that the second person is actually interested in *spending* the money, and *buying* the candy bar. If she decides she'd rather hide the second dime in her mattress, hoping that the same deus ex machina who produced the second dime will eventually produce a second candy bar for her to buy, the price will not go up at all.

Wallets are necessary. You have one if you've signed up for Changetip. There are sites like Coinbase and Circle which let you buy BTC and turn it into e.g. dollars and deposit it to your bank. (I'm from the US, so I don't know which are the best sites elsewhere.) They also have wallets, but because your money is kept on their servers, you're dependent on them to a degree that many people don't like. Then there are wallets you download to your own computer or smartphone, and finally hardware wallets (e.g., Trezor) and paper wallets, which are not connected to the internet and thus harder to hack. (Though you can of course inadvertently run your paper wallet through the laundry.)
These are places to keep the addresses that control access to your bitcoin. People here are very into security, as well they should be. For myself, though, I think that my degree of nervousness about security should be proportionate to the amount of BTC I have. When I got my first 100 bit tip (worth about three cents), I just kept it on Changetip, since it seemed to me that it made no sense to get all paranoid about losing such a tiny amount of money. I switched to a more secure wallet before I had anything like enough BTC to make this necessary; I was just enjoying playing with my bitcoin. 
I'd advise you to get comfortable with it first by playing with small amounts, and by reading stuff here. (The sidebars are full of useful information.) So here's a small amount to start with: 100 bits private

Actually, that's not true. A lot of the decrease in mortality was due to public health measures -- sewage systems, clean water, etc. This had a lot to do with medical advances, and what relationship those had to anything other than the state of medical science is more than I know. (At the time it wasn't government-funded, for the most part.) But actually getting the relevant changes implemented was in many cases up to the government. (Consider the development of municipal sewage systems.)

In all seriousness (and I'm saying this because I like you): you should not take this article seriously. The author claims that the Industrial Revolution, with its attendant huge increases in life expectancy and population, is due to natural selection for greater intelligence, and the fact that it happened in northern Europe is due to the fact that the further north (or, south of the Equator, south) you go, the colder it is, and thus the more you need intelligence in order to survive. So the selection pressures are greater the further from the Equator you go, which is why it was the clever northern Europeans who started the Industrial Revolution.
This is, frankly, silly. First, the times involved are way too short for natural selection to be the predominant factor. 
Second, there are lots of places where astonishing bursts of creativity have occurred without leading to an industrial revolution (though in some cases, i.e. China, they did lead to significant industrial advances.) Some of them are in cold climates, but others are not. (Again, China; also, ancient Greece, and central Asia at the end of the first millennium.) It's not intelligence or creativity that has been lacking; it's that these amazing outbursts did not, for some reason, transform themselves into anything like the industrial revolution we're now living through. 
Third, this explanation leaves it completely unclear why this happened in northern Europe, and not in other cold climates. (Why I brought up Russia earlier; one could also ask about the entire south.) 
Finally, there are a whole bunch of other factors that seem obviously relevant. The invention of the printing press, which allowed ideas to be preserved and diffused more effectively; a culture in which it was generally seen as good, rather than e.g. subversive, to try to figure stuff out for oneself; the invention of the limited liability corporation and permissive bankruptcy laws; the fact that Britain was not invaded for several centuries (one of the reasons why the central Asian burst of creativity went nowhere was the Mongol invasion and the resulting political instability); etc., etc., etc. 
Finally, the author just gets a lot of basic facts wrong. Consider this, about humans who had migrated from the tropics: "Not only did they have to learn how to deal with large animals, which did not exist in the tropics (except for the volcanic parts of Indonesia), and their movements." Is it true that "large animals" do not exist in the tropics? No, unless e.g. elephants and gorillas and water buffalo don't count as "large". When I read a sentence like this, I think: my confidence that the author can be trusted to get even basic facts right just flew out the window. And the part about 'the volcanic parts of Indonesia' makes me think: not only is he generally not interested in basic facts, he's one of those people who covers that up with what looks like a display of erudition, so that if you don't know what he's talking about, you'll think: cool, the volcanic parts of Indonesia!
History is fascinating. People who oversimplify it beyond recognition, not so much.

"hasn't it always gone back up to slightly higher than what it was before?"
No. We are nowhere near where we were a year ago, for instance. And even if it had always gone back to slightly higher than it was before, that would be no guarantee that it would do so again. -- I mean: that was true until about a year ago, except for the "slightly" part. And then, suddenly, it wasn't.
It's a very volatile investment. It should be treated as such. Which means: don't invest more than you are prepared to lose. The likelihood that you will lose everything if you invest in an index fund is very low. The likelihood that you will lose -- well, not everything, but close enough -- if you invest in BTC is considerably higher.

You can buy things with it, keep it in the hopes that it will appreciate in value, trade it for the currency of your choice, etc. I haven't looked into mining, but people here say that it requires computing power beyond the reach of ordinary people, and is virtually impossible to make a profit on.

Consider what you think you need to save for retirement, unforeseen expenses, etc. Do not invest that in Bitcoin; invest it in something that is less volatile, and more likely to hold its value. Then consider what (if anything) you're prepared to gamble with. If you think BTC is going up, that's a gamble you might want to take. 
I like BTC. But given its volatility, I wouldn't want to stake my retirement on it. 
@_date: 2014-11-13 06:43:12
I am new. I don't do technical analysis. Which is to say: I don't really know what I'm talking about.
But I have looked at the BTC historical charts. I can't recall seeing anything so volatile. What this tells me is: if you're looking to make money for something you really need, like your retirement, put it somewhere else. This could go up, but it could very, very easily go down. But if you have money to spare and feel like gambling, OK. 
Suppose it went to 100. Would you say: oh well, nothing ventured, nothing gained! If so, go for it. Would you bite your nails down to the quick and think: oh sweet Jesus, what have I done? If so, stick to something less volatile.

Yeah; this is an analogy that he takes from Milton Friedman, though it's also used by other people, including Keynes. The idea is: many forms of money involve the physical transfer of something valuable, e.g. a piece of gold, from one person to another. But it is possible to imagine a kind of money that is more abstract: you don't actually *give* e.g. the gold from one person to another; there's just a *record* of you transferring the gold. The Yap Islanders, who used enormous stones too big to be moved for money, and who transferred ownership just by *collectively remembering* who owned which immense limestone disc, are supposedly analogous to the blockchain.
It's really not about saying "Bitcoin is like rocks". It's: "Bitcoin is a kind of money that does not involve the physical possession of stuff, but the transfer of information." The Yap Islanders had to do this because their "coins" were too big and heavy; we get to do it because we have computers.

I tipped him because he wanted to learn about Bitcoin, and I thought he could do that with 100 bits, without needing to make any big decision. That's how I learned: someone tipped me 100 bits. 
When I talked about people asking, that wasn't about him; it was a reference to your saying that tipping 100 bits "blindly" encourages people to "push that threshold".
Also: as I said, in the original post, I did not, and do not, tip 100 bits "blindly". I have actually thought about the possibility that I could get scammed, and decided that life is too short to worry about that when 100 bits is at stake. I might even stretch things and give away 200 bits -- maybe even 300! -- without bothering to verify anything, not because I'm being "thoughtless" or "blind", but because when the stakes are low, I'd rather be generous and risk being taken in by someone willing to engage in deception for a truly minuscule reward than spend my life being cramped and suspicious. 
You are the one who keeps talking about "giving money away blindly". So tell me: do you think I really ought to have bothered to try to verify this person's claims, bearing in mind that the cost of doing so would be (a) time that's worth considerably more than the tip, and (b) living my life in a way I choose not to?

Actually, I chose the species I mentioned because I thought he might have been thinking of jungles, *and all of them live in jungles.*
Seriously, though: this is just bad pseudo-history. If the problem were lack of intelligence, you'd expect to find no outbursts of the kind of creative inventions that we had during the Industrial Revolution outside the north. In fact, there were a number of them; they just didn't take off. (The central Asian burst is actually very cool, and they did very good science and invented a whole lot of stuff, which was then lost because of the Mongol invasion and also because of changes in the intellectual climate, changes that had mostly to do with theology.) 
The reasons why they didn't take off don't seem to have much to do with intelligence; they include political stability and peace, the kinds of institutional arrangements that give people an incentive to develop and invest in new ideas (including some security of property, limited liability, and decent legal structures), etc.

As I understand it, the buying part is the credit card company charging fees. Circle itself does not. There's no fee for transferring money to or from your bank account.

Credit cards charge interest on the part of your bill that you do not pay on time. You would not have any such part with BTC, since BTC is not an instrument that allows you to spend money you don't have. If you used credit cards in the same way -- spending only what you have, paying the full balance each month -- then there is no interest, and the 3% cash back is a benefit of, well, 3%.

YW. -- One thing to know is that there are certain words that Changetip (the tipping program) has assigned tip values to. So if you see someone tipping another person a beer or a donut, that's what's going on. It is possible (I have seen it happen) for someone to use one of these words by mistake, while tipping someone. When the bot that does all of this detects two values, it will normally default to the smaller value. But it's worth knowing that you should not use any of the assigned words while you are tipping someone.
There's a list of these words here:  . You can also assign your own.

k3t3r is right. When the dollar deflates, normally not all currencies deflate along with it.

The blockchain holds addresses, and addresses let you access bitcoin. Some services (web wallets) give you a password that lets you access your addresses, just as banks let you access your money. However, while banks are backed by the US government, services that provide web wallets are not. So if they go bust, or turn out to be scams, too bad for you. 
If you have your own wallet on your own computer or smartphone, or in a paper wallet or Trezor, you don't have to worry about whether the entity who holds your passwords is trustworthy, because that someone is you .

I am a girl (OK, a woman) doesn't like to accuse people of anything. So I'll just say: a lot of very generous people on this subreddit have been giving money away, hoping to get people interested in bitcoin. A lot of times this has worked: it has allowed people to experiment, figure out how it all works, etc., without having first to set everything up, buy BTC, etc. All good!
But in the last few days, a whole lot of people have appeared, seeming to say: hey, give me some bitcoin too! I don't mind this myself, being one of the earlier new people. But you can see how it might bother some of the people who have already been very generous, especially since, this being Reddit, it's hard to tell who is a genuine new person and who just has a new account.
My advice, fwiw, is to stick around. The people here are generally very nice. If you try to learn, write constructive posts, etc., you'll do fine.

Probably yes. Various people's concerns about fiat money to the contrary, the dollar is a much better store of value than Bitcoin, especially if you value stability. And, as you say, ordinary money will be invested. That said, I'd go with a credit union or another small (= not too big to fail) bank, for the sake of economic stability. 
Some banks lend money to corporate raiders, who strip perfectly good corporations of their assets, leaving them at best saddled with debt, and at worst bankrupt. This helps no one. Better to go with a community-oriented bank that lends money to people it knows, and does not try to profit by stripping companies. imho.

This looks cool. 
Here's a story: I was once in Africa, and I went out onto my balcony early one morning to spray myself with insecticide, in order not to get malaria etc. Just as I was finishing up, who do you think climbed down onto my balcony? A baboon. A *large* baboon. There was no way out other than the door back into my room, and I thought: that would be a mistake. The baboon probably wants to get into my room, where there might be food, and if I opened the door, I would lose the one good thing this situation had in it, which was that no one was moving. I had no weapons. So I stared at him in what I hoped was an authoritative way, while saying, in my deepest voice: Go away. *Go Away.* 
Eventually, he did. After about five minutes, which sounds a lot less long than it felt. 
If I could have shown him a Bitcoin-themed ID, maybe everything would have been different.

I got mine in one of the first tipping threads, posted here, with a title like "Anyone want some bits to play with?" I did, and here I am. It didn't matter what the amount was; I just needed to see how this stuff worked. 
It would have been different if I had gotten a tip out of the blue in some other sub. There, I agree that it ought to be a non-negligible sum. But, as I said, it all depends on the circumstances. In some, 100 bits is more than enough.

Also, about positive rights: what I think is the major difference between libertarians and me is not "positive rights", but how we understand liberty. You can think of it either as freedom from interference by other people, or as the ability to actually do what you want to do. 
Consider (here I'm stealing from Elizabeth Anderson) traffic laws. They impinge on our freedom not to be interfered with every day. If freedom means freedom from being coerced by the government, then traffic laws are a constant infringement of our freedom. -- But traffic laws also help us to get where we need to go, and to arrive safely, without anyone dictating what our destination should be. If you think that freedom means the ability to actually get where you want to go, then traffic laws are not an infringement of it, but a good thing. 
(Compare, in this context, private property to traffic laws. Both involve government forbidding us to do certain things, in order to allow us more freedom to do whatever it is we want to do.) 
I'm a Democrat for the same reason that I approve of private property and traffic laws.

The economic system as a whole creates value. Sometimes this happens by people literally making a valuable thing. Sometimes, intermediaries do something that makes an existing thing a lot more valuable. I.e., in the 19th century, traders would go to places where they had heard that e.g. wheat was cheap, and take it to places where they had heard that it was needed. They were excoriated by various people for 'parasitically' profiting without actually making anything, but if you think about the risks involved in making this kind of trade at a time when communication was rudimentary compared to today, it seems pretty clear to me that they were creating a lot of value by transforming (wheat where it's not needed) into (wheat where people need it.)
Likewise, the people who created e.g. ways for people to get the money to make this kind of trade, capital markets, and economic instruments more generally created value. So did the various mercantile exchanges that finally replaced some of the functions of individual traders, and allowed farmers to sell their products on a central exchange, and to keep more of the profits. 
So: suppose you contrast a world without trade to a world with trade. People are much richer in a world with trade, Why? Because stuff gets where it's needed; because as a result more stuff is produced; etc. Note that the fact that more stuff is produced is not the sole reason that value increases. Does this mean that trade "creates value out of thin air"? Not if that means that the creation of value is just a trick.
If, somehow, BTC goes to the moon, that will presumably be because it is useful for some very important reason. It will enable kinds of economic activity that would not have been possible, or as convenient, otherwise. In so doing, it will create value, but that won't be "creating it out of thin air", at least not in any sense that implies that this creation is somehow illegitimate.

Look, I'm not trying to argue that industrialization had nothing to do with it. I just think that the claim that industrialization, not government, caused the drop in mortality is much, much too simple. 
Consider cholera: it was thought to be due to a "miasma" until 1854 (i.e., well into the industrial revolution in Britain), when a British epidemiologist showed that it was instead due to contaminated water. After that, governments began supplying clean water and disposing of sewage in ways that did not contaminate the water supply.
Or consider disinfection in hospitals: that only really started in the 1860s. Until then, doctors reused instruments etc. without sanitizing them, which meant that you were often more likely to die if you went to a hospital than you would have been otherwise, due to the pathogens that doctors themselves transmitted. Again, the industrial revolution was well under way before this discovery, which had huge results, and while I'm sure that all sorts of things, industrialization included, are related to this development in some roundabout way, it wasn't industrialization that led to this discovery, nor was it industrialization that led hospitals to begin sanitizing things.
You can be as rich as you want, but you won't be able to bring mortality down if you have no idea how to do it. And developments in medicine whose connection to industrialization is really unclear are what drove progress in bringing down mortality.

Other people, in other (similar) threads, have compared getting into bitcoin mining with getting into gold mining. If you (a person, not a large company) want to get into gold mining because you enjoy standing out there in the middle of a beautiful stream, panning for gold while enjoying the marvels of nature, that's great. Likewise if you're just fascinated by geology. But if you expect to actually make money at it, you will be disappointed.

Again: I'm not interested in "big government" for its own sake. Do you think that in a world in which Bitcoin plays a major role, there would be no more need for any kind of government? If so, which parts of the government do you think it would eliminate the need for? And why?
For my part, I think that we will always need taxation, rules governing markets, and some services. We can set up the basic rules of the game in various different ways. The question whether you're a progressive or a conservative or a libertarian or whatever concerns what rules you favor, what services you support, and why you support them. It's not as though Bitcoin is going to eliminate the need for, say, the army, or the SEC, or (if you support the army) the tax code. 
Whether you support the welfare state or not -- and, more importantly, what you think it should include -- doesn't seem to me to have much to do with Bitcoin.

I am really puzzled by all the threads about how much or how little people should tip. It seems pretty obvious to me that the right answer depends on where you are and what you're doing. On BitTippers, a lot of giveaways are for very small amounts (10 bits, 20 bits). This is fine: no one who is bothered by seeing small tips would be likely to show up there, and everyone who does knows the drill. When you set a thread for new people so that they can see how it works, again, small is fine. I don't tip BTC at all on r/assistance, since I really can't imagine saying to someone "Hey, you're about to run out of food entirely, and I'd like to help, but would you please first educate yourself on what bitcoin is, set up a wallet, etc., etc., and then I'll help." But if I did, I would of course tip a larger amount. 
Which is all to say: like most normal human interactions, how you tip depends on what the context is, and what you're trying to accomplish. Why anyone would try to set up a one size fits all standard is a mystery to me. 
@_date: 2015-05-12 00:38:21
It's generally hard to buy BTC with Paypal, because you can always allege that you didn't get your BTC and ask for a chargeback; reputable sellers are generally not willing to take that risk. You can buy BTC through Coinbase or Circle in the US, by linking a bank account or CC; the process of linking it takes a few days, but after that Circle, at least, is instant (though there's a maximum buy of a few hundred dollars; I'd be more precise, but I haven't ever bumped up against it.) 
Bitcoin ATMs and LocalBitcoin generally seem to charge a larger premium than Coinbase or Circle, but are also options.

This is because most of what we buy is not appliances, and therefore (a) we have no incentive to hoard money in general, and (b) the fact that we wait for new and cheaper appliance models to come out does not have a huge effect on the economy in general.

So: open Breadwallet, and go to the 'receive' screen. Open Changetip, scroll down until you find the 'Withdraw' section, and click the Send button. You will find a field called 'Bitcoin Wallet Address'. At this point, regrettably, you will have to copy the address you find in Breadwallet into this field. (If Changetip had an iOS app, or Breadwallet had a non-iOS app, you could copy and paste; you can still do that if you set up an intermediary wallet that has both, like Circle.)
Anyways, after you've copied the address, and checked it about four or five times to make sure you got it right, enter the amount you want to send into the 'Amount' field on the Changetip site, and voila!
Personally, I'd wait until you have an amount worth transferring in your Changetip account.

If you're looking towards securing your future, you should look seriously at the performance charts of various kinds of assets. Precious metals are volatile. I.e.:
If you look at gold vs. major currencies (disregarding e.g. gold vs. the rand, whose vagaries distort the chart), you could win very big, but you could also lose very big. Moreover, you could spend, say, the years between 1987 and 2001 -- which is a long time -- drifting gently downwards. This is not good. 
If you look at a major stock index -- I chose the S&amp;P 500 -- it's much more consistently rising. 
If what you want to do is gamble on winning big, by all means go for something volatile that you believe in. But if you're interested in securing your future, go for something that will give you security. 
Two more things: first, diversify, and second, remember that the world of investment is full of some very, very smart people who devote all their waking hours to winning at the expense of the rest of us. Unless you can match not only their brains but also the amount of time they sink into this stuff, I think it's a good assumption that picking individual stocks, etc., is likely to be a losing bet. Index funds that have low fees, on the other hand, are not.

I guess the question is: what will you do with any bitcoin you buy? If the answer is: immediately buy stuff, then don't bother downloading it; just buy it on Coinbase and then use it. If you want to hold onto it, do download it. 
Think of it this way: would you put your money in the hands of a company on the web, assuming that that company was not backed by e.g. US bank insurance? Probably not. But if you were planning to take that money and immediately buy something on Amazon (or wherever), the usual precautions wouldn't apply, since the likelihood that anything bad would happen in the time you left your BTC on the web would be small. 
Likewise, if the amounts themselves are tiny, you don't need to take as many precautions. I normally leave some amount of money in my Changetip wallet, but not enough that I'd really miss it if it disappeared. (Like: maybe a quarter, sometimes as much as forty whole cents!!! This is not worth protecting with extensive security, imho.)

Don't knock it. I've been lurking for a while, but I had no clue how to do any of this, especially the part where I acquire some actual BTC in order to see how this all works. Then there was that 'free tips' post, and as a result I created a wallet, transferred BTC into it, etc. The fact that it's an infinitesimal amount of money doesn't matter at all. 
@_date: 2014-12-11 19:49:50
Here is a historical chart of BTC's value:
As you can see (if you click on 'All', right above the chart), BTC was worth very little for a few years, then skyrocketed upwards, then dropped a lot, then gained some, then dropped another lot. For the past couple of months it has been moving basically sideways, with some jumps that make people say "yay! to the moon!", and some drops that make those same people say: "oh no, all is lost!"
Long story short: it's very volatile, and if any of us could predict its future price, we'd be rich. All sots of things are possible, but it is not at all guaranteed to go up in value.
@_date: 2014-12-04 23:12:36

What are you "pressing sell" in? Presumably some sort of program, but it would make a difference which. You can sell BTC for (e.g.) dollars in Circle, by transferring some amount of BTC to your bank account; in that case, Circle has a listed price, and it will exchange your BTC for dollars at that price. Within an exchange, there would have to be a buyer at the price you're asking.

General point about ethics: what matters most, for the most part, is for a given person to figure out what s/he should do, not to figure out what somebody else should do. I think it's often really interesting to note when someone is asked a question about what s/he should do, and answers with a claim about what someone else should do.
I.e.: Should you return the money? -- Well, the other person shouldn't have left it unsecured! -- It's obviously true that people  (or at least: people who care about their money) should not leave that money unsecured. If you see someone leaving their money unsecured, tell them! But the fact that *that person* should not have left his or her money unsecured in no way answers the question what *you* should do.

It's not that I have anything against filters, mind you; it's just that the energy required to make and power the massive filters you'd need would undermine the point of your idea. Whereas fairies, being wholly imaginary, require almost no energy at all.

I think it all depends. As I've said elsewhere, I really appreciated the 100 bit tip I got in the thread yesterday. It taught me more than anything else, and it also got me around what had been the major obstacle to my teaching myself before, namely my discomfort with buying bitcoin in any way that involves handing over my credit card/bank info. That thread was a wonderful idea, and no one who didn't appreciate it had to read it.
I can see that infinitesimally small tips might seem merely annoying -- though this is less true since the Changetip bot collects them automatically, so once you've set it up the first time, there's no annoyance at all. I can also see that cluttering up threads is a bad thing.
Otherwise, though, the kindness of strangers is not high up on my list of things to be annoyed about.

For starters, I should have noted that this: "if i thought billions (trillions?) of dollars could be stolen at any moment, i might hold fewer dollars." -- was not *my* statement. Also, fwiw, I m not bailing out of bitcoin.
To your point: Yes, if I had put my money in a mattress in 1913, it would buy less now than it would have bought then. But if you want to determine whether 2% inflation is good or bad for people, you have to look further than that. Does that amount of inflation lead people to invest money rather than hoarding it, and do those investments lead to higher growth overall? Does it make it easier for me to be an entrepreneur (e.g. through easier access to credit), potentially creating a whole lot of prosperity not just for me but for the people I employ, the people who use the good I create, etc.? 
Moreover: inflation has not just been low for the past year. It has been low for the entire duration of QE. That might make one wonder whether QE was actually inflationary when we are near zero interest rates, as you seem to suppose.

Also: a level of security between a Coinbase/Circle wallet (where they control your keys, and can in principle refuse to hand over your money) and Ledger or Trezor (where you have to buy hardware) would be a wallet that is on your computer or phone, and where you control the private keys. I use Breadwallet, which works on an iPhone; there are other wallets for other platforms. If you let us know what kind of computer or phone you'd like to store it on, people here can give you recommendations.
Also, if you decide to go the cold storage route but don't want to buy a Trezor, you could create a paper wallet.

OK, here are some serious questions:
(a) you have said a lot of things in the past. You have said that Paycoin would not go below the floor of $20; that people will be able to buy off the websites of Amazon, Target, Walmart, Best Buy, etc.; that you will be issuing a debit card, etc. None of these things have happened yet. What reason do people have to believe your present assurances?
(b) In particular, are you prepared to put this assurance in some legally binding form: "We will NOT allow any of our customers, that purchased through us or HashPoints, suffer a loss from their original investment."?
(c) You have said that you cannot maintain the $20 floor because  the CFTC forbids it. Two questions: (a) does the CFTC have jurisdiction over Paycoin? and (b) why did you not realize this before yesterday? Do you not have competent lawyers working for you? As far as I can tell, either you do have competent lawyers, in which case they would have *had* to have warned you about this beforehand, in which case you lied to your community; or else they did not warn you about this beforehand, in which case you have hired incompetent people to advise you; or else the CFTC does not have jurisdiction, in which case you were lying yesterday. Is there a fourth possibility that I have overlooked?
I might think of some more questions later. But if you read through the boards at Hashtalk and do not immediately think: I have to sell the Ferraris, the house, and everything to make up these people's losses -- then you have no morals and no soul.

If you read hashtalk, you'd know that Paycoin is never going to zero. There are some serious true believers there. I wrote this before, but: there's a classic social psychology book called 'When Prophecy Fails', about a cult whose leader had predicted that the world would end at a particular time. It didn't (obviously), and the psychologist who had sort of infiltrated the cult (ethics regs being laxer back then) took notes. A few people peeled off, but a lot of them ended up even more committed to the cult than before. Hashtalk reminds me of that. It is, more than anything, sad, but it also means: no zero.
See, e.g., here:

Sigh. It depends on why this is the case. If the reason the NBA was mostly non-white had to do with the lingering effects of pervasive discrimination against whites, it would be a problem.

OK, a couple more questions: 
(1) Can you provide evidence of the $100 million you said you were backed by? I understand that you might not be able to identify your backers, but there ought to be forms of evidence that do not require that kind of identification. 
Source: "When the coin opens to the public on Jan. 2 with what Mr. Garza says will be an anticipated market capitalization of $250 million, the company will partly back that with a store of fiat currency worth around $100 million. While those funds won’t function as a 100% reserve, they will combine with added features within the Paycoin protocol, including a supply schedule that fluctuates depending on the level of miner demand, to reduce exchange-rate volatility and thus seek to resolve one of bitcoin’s biggest barriers to mass adoption."

I like deterministic wallets, because I don't fully understand what I'd need to do to deal with expiring change wallets, backups, etc., for indeterministic wallets.
I like wallets whose keys I, personally, control.
I like wallets that are open-source. I am not capable of checking the code, but I like the idea that someone can. 
I like wallets that have a clean and usable interface, though that's less important than anything related to security. 
I just made an account at your site. I think that it's less welcoming than it might be to people who are not up to speed on bitcoin. For instance: if I want to send money from one wallet to yours, I need to already know that I should click "Get a new address". Other wallets have something like "Receive money", which does not (as your wallet does) presuppose that someone already knows how to use bitcoin. 
It's also odd that the only way to "withdraw funds" seems to be to donate money to you. How does one send money from this wallet to somewhere else? Maybe by putting in a new address in the field that presently contains yours; again, though, it's not clear, especially to new btc users.
Hope this helps; I'm always glad to see new wallets out there.

'A system of perpetual debt' makes it sound as though it's one group of people who are perpetually indebted. Fractional reserve banking does involve lending out money, but to people who normally pay it back, and might want to get into debt for a very good reason, like -- well, take me, for instance: I own a house, and thanks to fractional reserve banking, I was able to buy it before I had saved up the entire purchase price. My mortgage is not one I can't afford; my job is secure; my down payment was sizable, and the mortgage was not one of those odd 'will blow up' mortgages that one sometimes hears about. For me, taking out a mortgage makes perfect sense, and in a decade or so, it will be paid off. 
At that point, someone else might want to buy their first house, and do the same thing. Or else someone might want to start a business, but not want to save up the entire start-up costs first. Or whatever. If they do, then 'debts' will have been existing all along, but no one person will have been perpetually indebted. And if the loans are responsible (as mine was), what's the problem?
(One problem: bank runs. But as far as actual banks go, that was fixed by the FDIC.)

Also: from the WSJ's Bitbeat: "As for the charge that GAW is a Ponzi scheme, Mr. Garza pointed out that his principal partner, Cantor Fitzgerald Vice Chairman Stuart Fraser, in whose name the patent for one of Wall Street’s most important bond trading programs is listed, has “got more to lose than all of us combined.” He added, “Why would a guy that already has a ton of money, and would get thrown in jail if he was involved in anything sketchy, be involved in a scam?”"

'Security' by the standards of the law. Just because I am a nerd, I googled it. Here's the definition: 
"The term “security” means any note, stock, treasury stock, security future, security-based swap, bond, debenture, evidence of indebtedness, certificate of interest or participation in any profit-sharing agreement, collateral-trust certificate, preorganization certificate or subscription, transferable share, investment contract, voting-trust certificate, certificate of deposit for a security, fractional undivided interest in oil, gas, or other mineral rights, any put, call, straddle, option, or privilege on any security, certificate of deposit, or group or index of securities (including any interest therein or based on the value thereof), or any put, call, straddle, option, or privilege entered into on a national securities exchange relating to foreign currency, or, in general, any interest or instrument commonly known as a “security”, or any certificate of interest or participation in, temporary or interim certificate for, receipt for, guarantee of, or warrant or right to subscribe to or purchase, any of the foregoing."
 (This is the law that sets up the SEC.)
I assume that there is a pretty extensive set of regulations, cases, etc., defining all of these terms quite precisely.

How so? The regs might require things of an exchange -- proof of reserves,  for instance. That would not affect transaction times.They might also require that the exchange verify customers at the outset, as Coinbase and Circle already do. But this would not mean that once you're verified, transaction times would take any longer.
You'd still be able to use LocalBitcoins if you are willing to pay a premium for privacy. But an exchange would offer a lot of other advantages, and if those mattered more to you, you would be free to choose the exchange instead.

I mean: I know this because this is how I got started: with a 100 bit tip which led me to make a Circle wallet for the express purpose of moving my 100 bits into it, to experiment. And it worked! It was so cool!

Actually, no. The credit card company gives you a tiny sliver of the profits it makes from *someone*. Whether you are that someone or not depends on whether you incur fees.

A mature and respectable approach would involve actually answering those questions, or at least those that were made respectfully. It is not mature and respectable to appear, announce your willingness to answer questions, and then vanish. In this particular case, it's also part of a pattern: problems appear, Josh Garza says something, people say: oh, look how brave he is *to say something!!!*, and then nothing actually happens.

That's not right. At any rate, I have moved BTC both into and out of my Changetip wallet, and it works either way. So maybe, on your view, we're tipping funbux, but it's at least worth adding that these funbux magically transform themselves into BTC when you withdraw them.

I am not an investment advisor. Do not believe things people tell you on the internet! Etc. That said: as I understand it, if you invest in stocks and don't pick them yourself (which is a bad idea for almost everyone not prepared to devote their life to this), you can pay for an active advisor, or do something like an index fund, which just mimics a broad-based stock index. Also as I understand it, once you factor in the higher fees that active advisors charge, you're better off with the index fund, especially over time. It's also more diversified, especially if you pick one of the larger indexes.

You're welcome. -- I got started in the same way that you just did: by being tipped. In my opinion, this is one of the key, and insufficiently recognized, uses of tipping: it makes it possible for you and me to play with a little bit of bitcoin *without having to buy it first*. Which means: without having to decide which of these services are trustworthy, which you'd want to give your SSN to, etc. I had been lurking around here for a while, being curious but not feeling comfortable with it, when someone offered free 100 bit tips to anyone who asked. My 100 bit tip -- all of three cents!!! -- was all it took to get me over the chicken and egg problem: it's hard to feel comfortable before you've played around a bit, but you have to feel comfortable in order to get a little BTC to play around with in the first place. Or rather, you would, if it weren't for tipping.
Every so often, people here make posts about how silly tipping is. ("Giving someone a few cents: how insulting!" Etc.) I think they completely miss how important it was for me, and perhaps for you. In my case, the tininess of the tip didn't affect its usefulness at all; if anything, it made it easier for me to play with it without worrying. 
In any case, again, welcome!

I think that the level of security you need should be proportional to how much you have, and how disastrous it would be to lose it. A Trezor costs $119; that's about what I have in bitcoin, so for me, it seems like overkill, despite its excellent reputation. 
I feel OK storing up to a couple of bitcoin in a good computer wallet. Electrum and Armory seem to get good reviews, and there are others that are more platform-specific. (I.e., breadwallet for iPhones.) If I had more than, oh, 5x the cost of a Trezor, I'd consider buying one.
There are also paper wallets, which are as cheap as can be, and very secure as long as you remember not to run them through the laundry or do any of the other things that harm paper, but seem to require knowing more. (I.e., what if you only spend part of what's in your paper wallet? Etc.) 
@_date: 2015-01-07 16:24:47
I'm an individualist: I believe that people should be judged by who they are, not by someone else's stereotypes. But I see zero reason to think that this means that it would be somehow wrong for me to create, say, WomenInBitcoin. (And, no: Girls Gone Bitcoin does not count.) 
Whatever I think ought to be the case, and despite the fact that most people on this sub are fine, it is amusing how often people just assume that I am a guy -- because I'm *here*, after all -- and it would be interesting to have a bunch of other women to talk about that with. Not interesting enough, to me, that I actually feel like taking the trouble to do it, but I can see the point.
I also don't think that being an individualist requires that I deny history. In the US, "whites only" groups have a history. We are, presumably, all aware of that history. There is no obvious reason to repeat it, especially since "whites in bitcoin", as such, do not have the kind of common experiences as, say, women, Poles, Brits, etc. (There is no common "white" community of the sort that gives rise to shared experiences, issues, etc. There are smaller white communities of this sort: Croatians, Poles, French, etc.) 
So even though in some Mr. Spock-like world of pure logic, "whites in bitcoin" might be thought of as equivalent to "blacks in bitcoin", in this world it's more like "Germans of Aryan descent in bitcoin", only without the stock of shared experiences that might make that defensible even in theory.
Again: *nothing* about being an individualist requires that I deny this.

At lest in the US (apologies if you're not from here), the best places to buy with credit cards seem to be Circle and Coinbase. There are also various ways of buying directly from people who have bitcoin to sell, which you can probably find in the sidebar; I'm not familiar with how they work. 
Since you collected a tip (I was going to tip you, but Throwahoymatie got there first :) ), you now have a Changetip wallet; you said below that you're checking out Circle. Circle has always worked fine for me, but like most online wallets, it requires that you trust Circle with your money. (Think of Circle, Coinbase, etc. as being like banks, only without the regulation and without the bank insurance. If you know US history, think of the days when every couple of decades, there would be widespread bank runs, and people would lose everything when their bank went under.) 
For this reason, most people (including me) recommend a wallet whose keys you control. I use Breadwallet (works on iPhone.) Others can recommend wallets for different platforms. With a wallet that's under *your* control, there is no company to be hacked, etc. 
Of course, *you* could still be hacked. (Or forget your password, or whatever.) This is why some people will recommend "cold storage", which basically means something that is not, and never was, connected to the internet. Some cold storage involves hardware devices designed for this purpose: i.e., Trezor. You can also print up paper wallets, which are exactly what they sound like. (But remember all the various ways in which paper can be damaged. The fact that your bitcoin is invulnerable to hackers will be cold comfort when you realize that you ran it through the laundry.)
For my part, I haven't gotten into cold storage, because I don't have nearly enough money in bitcoin for it to be worth it. (I just looked up the price of a Trezor, and, as I suspected, it's a *lot* more than my present stock of bitcoin.) In my view, the security precautions you take should be proportionate to how bad it would be for you to lose your bitcoin: with the $1 you got from Throwahoymatie, you could just leave it in Changetip if it weren't so much fun to play with. You can just use that money to experiment with, and settle on a permanent wallet down the line, when you're more familiar with it all.
Until then, welcome!

Yes. One can believe in bitcoin and still think any of the following:
(a) There is a lot of room between a great idea and its widespread adoption.
(b) Falling prices can damage the bitcoin ecosystem, i.e. by making miners, venture capitalists, etc., move out, and this can have real effects on bitcoin's long-term viability.
(c) At some point, bitcoin needs to become a decent store of value. It is not a decent store of value as long as its price keeps falling like this.
(d) We have lives. We have bills to pay. And the market can remain irrational longer that we can remain solvent, to paraphrase Keynes.

P.S. I can give you a hint on how well it went..."
As far as I can tell, no such 'review' or 'validation' was ever made public. It's also odd that it was done by a *publication*, and not by, say, an auditing firm.

This is logically possible right now. All it would take would be for everyone to *give* the miners all their bitcoin.
Which is not going to happen, any more than everyone is going to part with all their bitcoin in fees.

I have more than zero but less than one. I got into it via a 100 bit tip, which let me play around and figure out how it worked. (For some reason, the excellent descriptions in the sidebars weren't cutting it for me; I needed hands-on experience. I think it was who gave it to me; I hope I thanked him or her at the time, but if not: thanks now. :) )
@_date: 2015-01-16 04:51:10
So: you just got a tip for 1500 bits. You can use this to play around with different wallets. (I got into bitcoin via a tip; I found that it helped me to learn how it worked in a way that none of the sidebar articles -- which are excellent! -- could do, and it helped that the sum was so small that I wasn't afraid of losing it.)
To buy bitcoin in the US: Coinbase and Circle are the best. I am in the US, so I don't know about other countries.
For bitcoin wallets: tell us what computer or phone you'll be using it on, and we can give recommendations. You can leave your tip in the wallet that Changetip will set up for you for now, or transfer it to Circle or Coinbase. But any of these options involve third parties controlling your access to your bitcoin. It's better to set up a wallet where you control the private keys, which means that you control your access to your money. I use Breadwallet, which is for iOS. Other people can help you to decide what to do for other platforms.
If you end up with enough bitcoin that you need serious security measures, consider cold storage, which means: holding your bitcoin offline. The two main ways to do this are: (a) paper wallets, which are what they sound like, and (b) hardware designed for this purpose, like the Trezor. Paper wallets don't require an upfront investment, but you have to make sure you don't lose them, run them through the laundry, etc. Hardware solutions cost money; I haven't gone that route since they cost more than I own. (In general, I think that one's degree of paranoia should be proportional to ones holdings, and to how much it would hurt you to lose them. It would be silly, imho, to get into cold storage in order to secure your 1500 bit tip, unless you are so broke that $0.33 is the difference between life and death for you. But if you acquire serious sums, you should protect them seriously.)
Hope this helps, and welcome!

True. However: I spent a while running an internet community totally unrelated to bitcoin. It was a fun group, with great commenters and a great sense of community. I was constantly amazed by the people who would come by with no apparent purpose than to disrupt stuff. 
I have no idea what would make anyone do this. Life is short, and the world is full of interesting things, so I don't really see why anyone would spend their time doing this, of all things. However, at a certain point, I decided that for reasons best known to themselves, some people think this is the way they want to spend their time. 
It's partly because I saw the exact same thing happen elsewhere that I don't feel driven to assume that people are paid, as opposed to just being obnoxious.

It is worth noting that other countries have been a lot more indebted than we are, as a percentage of GDP, and lived to tell the tale. Britain in the 19th century, for instance, had debts totaling 245% of GDP; they were back down to 25% by 1914, as a result of paying some off but also the growth of the national economy. Chart:

"if one truly needs something, one buys it anyway, and what one does not truly need one should not buy at all."
This is, um, insane. I need to eat. I do not in the same way "need" to eat food that tastes good. I really do not need to eat delicious food that someone else has prepared for me. Does it follow that I should subsist on the cheapest source of calories I can find, even if they are utterly tasteless and vile? Why on earth should I ignore the cost to me in all this?

And this, from the article, is the part I think is a pretty weak tie-in: "Mr. Garza stated that a percentage of the profits for ZenPool came from “day trading.” The fact that he stated it was from day trading created a situation in which, according to various securities laws, makes it a security. This is the first major cornerstone that the SEC intends on using in a potential enforcement action."
To be clear: from everything I've read, I think Garza should be behind bars. I'm just wondering why the SEC, in particular, is involved.

None of us really knows at all what the price is likely to do. Check out the charts on Bitcoin Wisdom to get a sense of just how volatile it is:
The past 24 hours have been unusually volatile, because (I think) of the Coinbase exchange announcement, but it's been up over 25%, and down almost as much, in that period. 
In your shoes, if I were going to start, I'd get a very small amount at first, and learn how it works. This way you don't have to really "commit" (much, or all at once.) But always be aware that this is not an investment you should choose if safety matters to you. Think of it as a wild gamble, with a lot of upside potential and, of course, a lot of downside potential as well. 
That said, I'm just a random person on the internet, so you shouldn't trust me. :)

I've only been reading them recently; I hadn't heard of Paycoin until last weekend. But a lot of them seem to think that the world in general, and bitcoin people in particular, have it in for them: apparently, we are terrified by the threat that Paycoin poses to us, and will do anything to keep it from succeeding. So what we write is just our effort to spread FUD.
It's sort of analogous to the claims people make here, every so often: the Powers That Be will never allow bitcoin to succeed; therefore any drop in price, hacking or theft, or other failure is probably the work of malevolent forces, not just of, say, some company's failure to have decent security practices, the fact that bitcoin is still pretty tough to use for non-geeks, or some more ordinary and less conspiratorial thing.
The difference is that here, that line of thinking does not dominate; there, it really does.

Was my question disrespectful? If so, that was not my intent. People are claiming that you are running a Ponzi scheme: making all kinds of promises, paying out the first few people who get in, and then letting it collapse while other people hold the bag. One of the things they say to support this is: that you never had the backing you claimed to have, and that you never mined the blocks you claimed you did. If those people are wrong, presenting evidence to that effect would be the obvious way to prove it. Hence my question.

Also, clearer claims about integration with Amazon, Target, Walmart, Macy's, and Best Buy:
"That’s right, you will be able to shop with Paycoin on the Amazon, Target, Walmart, Macy*s and Best Buy’s online stores.
We’ve been busy integrating with major store platforms to make purchasing work the way people are used to already.
Here is how it works:
Paybase Express integrates into your Chrome Browser, (with more browser support coming,) and adds a check-out with a Paybase button right inside the website of your favorite online stores.
Once you click the “Check out with Paybase” button, you will see a modal more screen confirm your order in Paybase, and the magic happens.
Ever use Paypal? This works exactly the same way, but the PayPal overseers don’t get their cut or say-so. Since the merchant pays less to process your order, it will cost you less, and so we pass those savings back to you.
We have done all the back-end technical work to allow the merchant to fulfill the order. There is nothing you need to do but click and confirm. No gift cards to buy, no strange wishlists. Just shop like you normally do. That’s it!"

The answer is: all the enterprise accounts we just set up at all the major exchanges. We are going to start aggressively pushing the market up ourselves.
Want to know how we will offer a $20 floor? The answer is easy. We will move the market with our buying power. The market will be above the floor."
Later in comments he repeats his claim that he will keep the price above the floor. I can't figure out how to link to a specific comment there (the comment is right below the picture of Donald Trump lying on a hotel bed, if you're scrolling), so I took a screenshot today:

Wrong analogy. It presupposes that you know what the outcome will be, when you don't.
If you had the gift of prophecy, you would be able to tell whether holding BTC was (a) like investing in the email protocol early on, or (b) like investing early on in a product with decent ideas behind it that unfortunately never caught on, or (c) like investing in something that started small, had an insane spike to 1100, and then settled down in the high 100s for a while, or ... well, you get the idea.
The whole point of investing is that you have to decide what to do *without* the gift of prophecy. You have *no idea whatsoever* whether this is like investing in the email protocol when email was in its infancy.
I'd tell my friend: don't invest more than you can afford to lose, and be sure to diversify. (And in this context, 'diversify' does not mean 'hold several cryptocurrencies.')

A lot of those businesses depend on assumptions about the number of people who use bitcoin. And that number depends in part on people's confidence in it as, among other things, a store of value.

Mortgages have been around forever, and mortgages *per se* were not the cause of the financial crisis in 2008. What was different, then, was the fact that the mortgages were being securitized, which meant that (a) the people who made them did not hold onto them, and thus had no incentive to make *good* mortgages, and (b) the companies who securitized them also got the mortgages off their books fairly quickly, with the same result. These two things, plus some others like the near total failure of the ratings agencies, meant that there was a huge market for mortgages and no enforcement of quality standards. People were trying to get literally anyone into a mortgage. 
That's a recipe for disaster. But it has nothing to do with people who take out conventional mortgages that they can afford, with a decent-sized down payment, and everything to do with the creation of exotic financial products that no one really understood.
We don't have bank runs on normal banks anymore. We do have the FDIC, which is funded by banks paying for its insurance, and (on rare occasions) by special assessments on banks. It's not funded out of taxes.

Actually, it's not a good thing. It might be if there were no such things as barriers to entry, network effects, etc. Or, in general: things that make it the case that a competitor who can deliver a better product at a lower price will necessarily prevail.
But there are such things. It takes money to get things up and running. There are lots of times when being first beats being better. 
If laws and, gasp, regulations exist to prevent monopolies, then it is more likely that competition will result in the best (according to consumers) firm winning. But if firms can just leverage network effects, use large market positions to bankrupt their competitors, etc., then there is no guarantee at all that the best product (from the point of view of consumers) will prevail.

No one stole it back. Changetip has the following feature: when you tip someone who has not yet linked his or her account with Changetip (thereby creating a Changetip wallet), it leaves a message telling that person how to link her account to Changetip. If you followed that message and linked your account, go to the Changetip website, log in, and check your balance. 
If, however, you did not follow the message and link your account, then you did not collect the tip. In that case, after a week, Changetip cancels the tip. 
This isn't stealing at all. Imho, it's a good thing: I've given out a bunch of tips that no one collected, and it would be a pity if neither I nor the people I tipped could ever use that money.

As everyone else has said: do not invest more than you can afford to lose. Better still: do not invest more than you would be prepared to assume is already gone, for the sake of a gamble.
Also: I am struck, sometimes here but more often in Hashtalk, by the number of people who say things that take the following form: some desirable outcome is usually preceded by some bad thing; this bad thing is happening now; therefore the desirable outcome is on its way. A non-crypto example is some totally talentless artist saying: they laughed at Picasso too! Which is of course silly: people laugh at lots of artists (and musicians, etc. etc.), but only a very small fraction of those laughed-at artists turn out to be geniuses. So being laughed at proves nothing.
Examples from crypto include: the dip is the best time to buy (assumes that what's going on is a dip which will be followed by a rise, rather than one bit of a descent to zero); we're just shaking out the weak hands so that our eventual rise will be stronger (obvious); no one thought email/the internet/etc. was useful when it first started either (most of the things people do not find useful are, in fact, useless); I bet that people thought that early evangelists for Apple/Amazon/whatever were crazy too (also obvious), etc.
My best advice would be: never, ever succumb to this fallacy. Decide what you're in this for. Is it fun? Then only put in the amount that keeps it fun, even if your chosen coin goes to zero. Is it an investment? Then be very, very sure that you understand exactly why you think it will eventually be profitable (i.e., for a coin: how much acceptance does it need to succeed in the way you expect? And how likely is it that it will gain that degree of acceptance, especially since a lot of people are wary of putting their money in largely untested currencies?)
Another piece of advice: the fact that some currency is, in your opinion, totally revolutionary and brilliant does not in any way guarantee adoption. People adopt things for the strangest reasons, and the most brilliant stuff can just fail. This is especially true when it comes to currencies, where people are relatively risk averse.

The Swiss currency did not collapse. Actually, terms like 'strong' and 'weak' are misleading with respect to currencies. A 'strong' currency sounds good, but it makes your exports more expensive, and imports less so; as a result, it tends to hollow out the sectors that you might export (i.e., manufacturing), and make your balance of trade worse. Conversely, a 'weak' currency can help exports and the balance of trade.
What happened with Switzerland was that their currency was *too strong*, so they tried to peg it to the Euro, to prevent their exports from being eviscerated. This didn't work, so now they have to let it rise against the  Euro. It is the exact opposite of "collapse".
tl;dr: American Pegasus is wrong again.

The difference between r/BitTippers and r/Freebits is that r/BitTippers requires a flair, and getting the flair requires that the mod think that you are not just hanging around waiting for tips, but giving them as well.

It's a tiny tax (0.1%), primarily aimed at high-frequency traders. It would have very little impact on people who move into a stock with the intention of holding a position for a reasonable period of time. It would have a lot of impact on people who are looking to move large sums in and out of a particular stock in very short periods of time in order to take advantage of e.g. arbitrage opportunities.

They did announce a program that says: if you put your coins in escrow, we will spend a minimum of $100k a month buying them back at $20, starting i think in April. No details about whether some people get paid first (and if so, in what order), or whether everyone who signs up gets paid some fraction until $20 is reached.
So, basically: put your coins in escrow, and trust that GAW will keep their end of the bargain.

This is silly. Changetip is not about monetizing human interaction. It is a tool. It allows you to send people small bits of money pretty painlessly. There are lots of reasons for doing this other than "monetizing human interaction". 
For instance: you might want to give someone a small amount of bitcoin so that they can play with it without having to buy some first. You might be part of r/BitTippers and like hosting giveaways and contests. You might want to participate in r/Millionaire and be frustrated by PayPal.
There are all sorts of things you might do with it, other than 'monetizing human relationships'. That that's the only thing *you* can think of to do with it just reflects a problem with your imagination. Why you felt compelled to write a whole post about this is a mystery to me.

You also have to bet big to lose big. The problem is, no one knows whether a bet on BTC is a winning or losing one. *That's why it's a bet.*

There's  difference between "regulating bitcoin" and "regulating companies who offer specific services to people using bitcoin, services no one is obliged to use." The second does not involve "trying to control the technology". And as I understand the proposed NY regs, that's what they will be doing: regulating companies who serve as financial intermediaries (i.e., are bank-like or exchange-like.) 
Also: NY will regulate these companies. So will most other states. Having actual regs, as opposed to unknown future regs, allows businesses to know what they have to do. And businesses like predictability.

First, where I tip, most people thank me. Second, I would hate to think that tips weren't delivered, and if I didn't have confirmation (see first point) that they were, I might be worried. But since they are being delivered, for me the main points are (a) fun and (b) helping out people who are curious about bitcoin, and want a little bit to play with, just as I did.
If I give someone who claims to be curious about this 200 bits to play with, so that they can find out how it works the way I once did, without having to give out bank info etc., I'm happy. I'm paying back the favor someone once did me, which is what got me into this sub in the first place. And if that person is a scammer, who's worse off: me, for having been "scammed" out of six whole cents, or that person, for having no principles? 
This really doesn't seem to me to be a serious question. As I've said before: when you're tipping content providers, big tips are good. But when you're tipping the bitcoin-curious, the size of the tip doesn't matter: they can learn what they need to learn just as well with a small tip as with a large one. 
Basically, I think you need to make a choice. If you want never ever to be scammed, you will pass on helping a lot of people who  you'd want to help, if you were omniscient and knew all about them. If, on the other hand, you want to help those people (in this case, helping people to get their feet wet in BTC), you risk being scammed. *Unless you are omniscient; you will make mistakes one way or another; the only question is which kinds of mistakes you want to make.* I've made my choice.
I'm not worried about Changetip scamming me, since, as I said, I get lots of confirmation that people are actually receiving their tips. But the actual people might be scamming me. That's a risk I am prepared to take.

Just to be clear: the actual proposal is here: 
You need to scroll down to get to the part about this tax. Tl;dr: he's talking about a small tax of 0.1%. It is aimed at high-frequency traders: the proposed tax is small enough that its effects on anyone who wants to buy stocks and hold them would be negligible, but its effects on, say, arbitrage bots would be significant. 
Here's the actual text:"The United States can curb the kind of financial speculation that creates no value for the economy by implementing a tiny fee on financial market transactions, and then use the revenue to provide tax relief to American workers and their families. The United States already has an infinitesimal fee on stock transactions that funds the Securities and Exchange Commission, and many other countries – including the United Kingdom, France, Singapore, and Hong Kong – have financial market trading fees. The European Union is moving toward a trading fee of 0.1 percent that would raise as much as €37 billion (roughly $44 billion) per year. For comparison, the UK already applies a fee that is five times higher (0.5 percent) on stock trades. American financiers and high rollers have claimed that financial trading would migrate to other countries if the U.S. imposes a financial market trading fee – but as the EU nations join the many other countries with financial centers that have trading fees, there is no reason why the United States should not also move forward in concert with others.
Such a financial market trading fee, which could raise tens of billions of dollars each year, would be imperceptible to average investors, who already bear transaction costs on every trade that by some estimates are over three times higher than the fee the EU is proposing. At the same time, however, it would rein in the kind of computerized high-speed trading that skims value from regular investors while adding no value to the economy. As financial observers have pointed out, the profits currently being pocketed by front-running high-frequency traders already amount to a kind of hidden trading fee on ordinary investors. A properly structured financial market trading fee would put an end to much of this economically counterproductive activity and replace it with a source of revenue to pay for middle-class tax relief."

So if anyone wants the tl;dr (just based on reading Hashtalk; no inside knowledge): 
(a) Garza announced a program (PayFlash) that would allow people to transform their Paycoin into Gyft cards. This is important, since until now Paycoin has had basically no uses at all.
(b) When people buy these cards, Paycoin is sold to buy btc. So the price tanks. And by 'tanks', I mean that Paycoin, which was supposed to have a $20 floor, and had been at $3-4 for the past week or so, went down to a penny.
(c) Garza says: oh noes, the price is being manipulated! (Like I said: I have no inside knowledge. Payflash is one reason why the price might go down, but for all I know, it might have been manipulated.)
(d) Garza shuts down Paybase, which is the official Paycoin exchange.
(e) His devoted following, who have been frantically transferring btc into Paybase in order to get the coins at this very cheap rate, scream bloody murder. They have transactions in the process of being fulfilled that are suddenly put on hold. See here:

Consider Craigslist. You post stuff you have for sale, or stuff you want; other people who want what you have, or have what you want, can contact you. Imagine an even better Craigslist, one that matches you up with people automatically (so that if, say, you want to buy X, and someone else wants to sell X, it will put you in touch.) Now imagine an *even better* Craigslist: one that allows you to do this buying and selling without regard to location. If anyone anywhere has what you want or wants what you have and is on SuperDuperCraigslist, SDC will put the two of you together and facilitate your transaction.
You might say: well, I guess the only advantage of SuperDuper Craigslist over walking around asking people whether they want to buy my old washing machine is "speed". In a sense, you'd be right, if by "speed" you mean "instantaneous as opposed to very time-consuming, and requiring that I meet people in some Starbucks somewhere with my washing machine, and all that".

Her clothes were damp with sweat, and her muscles were aching. She had put as much weight on the machine as it would take, and done set after set, and though her body was exhausted, her mind was as tense as ever. What on earth had she been thinking when she started this? And how had it all gone so wrong?
Obviously, she knew the answers. She had taken a few computer courses in college, and had taken to them quickly. She kept up with it, more for fun than anything else. Then, when her husband had had to spend time away pursuing his quixotic ambitions, she had found coding at first soothing -- her mind liked the clarity of it, the way you could just *solve* problems, so unlike problems with human beings, especially the ones you loved. 
But then, perhaps because her husband was away playing poker with politicians pursuing his apparently hopeless dreams, she had come up with a completely hopeless dream of her own. A dream that she could pursue on her computer, when the kids were asleep. A dream that was wilder than anything her husband had thought of -- and that was saying something.
How was she supposed to know that the dream would take on a life of its own? She had always worried that she would not be able to keep her human children safe -- that they would become drug addicts, or criminals, or heaven knows what. Her fears for them had not, thank God, materialized. But the child of her mind had not been so lucky. Once it had escaped from her control, it had gotten involved in scams, dark markets for drugs and worse. She knew this was not its fault -- it was a computer protocol, not a human being with a will of its own. And she knew that it was not her fault: whatever use other people had put her invention to, she had not used it in that way. For heaven's sake, she laughed to herself, I barely used it at all, once I mined the genesis blocks. 
But what she had never predicted -- not in her wildest imaginings -- was the horrible intersection between her husband's success and hers. Each of them was so unlikely, so completely, wildly implausible. Both of them had had the kinds of dreams that most people would dismiss without much more than a chuckle. Against all odds, both of them had succeeded. And who on earth could have foreseen that?
She thought back to the message she had found on her computer that morning: a message informing her that if she did not transfer all her bitcoin to an anonymous address within twenty four hours, two things would happen. First, she would be publicly exposed as Satoshi Nakamoto, which was true. And second, evidence linking her to a murder for hire ring, all paid in bitcoin, would be released. That, of course, was false, but the sample of the evidence the author had provided looked convincing. 
What her husband would make of this she did not know. His people might be able to figure out who was behind it; they certainly had tools as good as anyone's. But he would not be pleased, to put it mildly, by the near-certainty of a media firestorm centered around the idea that his wife was in charge of a ring of contract killers.
Still, she had no choice but to tell him. She had tried to figure out where the message had come from, but her skills were a bit rusty after all these years of lying low. She wished she could just deal with it herself, but at the moment, that did not seem to be an option. 
She went back upstairs, took a shower, and waited for him to come home for dinner. After five or ten fidgety minutes, she heard his step outside the door, and braced herself. He opened the door.
"Hi, sweetie", he said.
"Hi, Barack. There's something I need to tell you ..."

In order to know whether merchants are good or bad for the price, you need to know not only what proportion of them sell BTC immediately, but what their existence does to demand. Some people who buy things with BTC will replenish their coins immediately. In this case, the effect is neutral. The important questions, I would think, are (a) what proportion of people who buy things with BTC do not replenish their coins? and (b) how many people (if any) will get interested in bitcoin as more merchants start using it? I.e., how many gamers who had heard something about bitcoin but not really paid attention will start paying attention because they heard that Microsoft accepts it? And how many of those who do start paying attention will get into it? 
Unless you know the answers to these questions, you only know one side of the equation. It's like saying: buying things is bad for you, because it costs money! without considering whether it has compensating benefits.
For my part, I think that until bitcoin is accepted by a critical mass of merchants, it will always be a niche product, a kind of curiosity, used only by cryptonerds and speculators. If that's your vision of the future, feel free to bitch about the merchants.

Well, reimburse was my word. What he said was: "We will NOT allow any of our customers, that purchased through us or HashPoints, suffer a loss from their original investment." I can see limiting that to *his customers* -- the people who bought into XPY because they believed in him and his vision -- as opposed to speculators. (How one would draw that distinction, I have no idea; I just mean that *if* one could draw it, I could see paying back the community but not the speculators at $20.) But I *do not* think it's remotely OK to market a coin based on its stability, with a floor backed by a supposed large fund of fiat, make an attempt to defend that floor that lasts for a few minutes, and then say: oops, my bad, you get $4 instead. At least not without selling off all your own assets in an attempt to make people whole. 
Have you read Hashtalk at all? It's just incredibly sad. -- There was a psychologist named Lionel Festinger who wrote a book about a cult whose leader had prophesied the end of the world, and specifically about what they did when the world did not end as planned. It's a classic in psych. Hashtalk at the moment is like watching the events in that book unfurl in real time. It's just horrible. And no one who had any principles at all could watch this happen, knowing that he was responsible for it, and not do everything in his power to set things right. 
PS: If I were one of the people who had bought into this, I would be asking myself what I had done wrong. I would probably come up with an interesting list of answers. But if I were Josh Garza, I wouldn't be interested in that. I would be interested in *my* responsibility, not someone else's, and I would be doing everything in my power to make things right, or at least as close to right as I could.

If you are, for instance, a regulated firm interested in investing in btc, you might have to do so via a regulated exchange. If so, this will allow you to make that investment.
If you are a firm that is leery of investing via exchanges whose ownership, practices, and reserves are murky, this might provide you with greater confidence.
If you are an ordinary person and you don't want to use this, you don't have to. But you might still benefit from its availability to others, e.g. because additional investments might make the btc market more liquid, less volatile, etc.

Yes. But in addition to flat-out breaking his promises, sometimes he does something that you can, if you try really hard and forget why the promise was supposed to matter, take to be "keeping his promise". I.e.: he said he was going to maintain a $20 floor under Paycoin. This mattered because one of the selling points of Paycoin was supposed to be its price stability, and also because the people who invested in it did so in large part based on that promise, which they understood to mean that they would be able to sell at $20.
If you ignore all that, and squint really hard, and clap to keep Tinkerbell alive, you can tell yourself that the fact that he did try to maintain a floor for maybe a minute or two (which seems to be true) counts as "keeping his word". If you have any common sense, you'd say "well, if that's what "keeping your word" amounts to, I will never invest anything with you again, because I don't have time to figure out all the infinitely many things that could possibly count as "keeping your word". 
I think that he might have some such thing in mind for this buyback offer. 
That said, I think that the real risk is that he will be bankrupt or in jail long before the buyback is done.

To me, asking my opinion on regulations is like asking my opinion on things. Life would be pretty difficult if there were no things. That said, some of them are good, and some of them are bad. 
I don't think we can or should try to do without regulations. To those total libertarians out there: the government regulates what counts as private property. This seems unnecessary as long as you're thinking about things like your coat or your car. But what if you own land that a stream flows through, a stream that you and others who live on it use to irrigate your land? Could someone upstream from you just decide to divert *all* the water, on the grounds that once it flowed onto his land, it was his? If not, how much could they divert? 
Likewise, think of intellectual property. We don't think of a lot of innovations as intellectual property, even though some of them are highly cherished by the people who came up with them. (Think of fashions in clothing, especially among teenagers.) Which ones should we be able to patent or copyright, and for how long? 
Or think of traffic laws. I've always wondered how libertarians deal with this. If freedom means not being interfered with, especially by the state, then traffic laws are one big giant loss of freedom, and one that we encounter all the time. But if freedom means being able to get where you want to go and arriving in one piece, without anyone having the right to tell you what your destination should be, then traffic laws (driving on one side of the road, stop signs and red lights, etc.) are a net gain for freedom. Most libertarians I know have a hard time getting exercised over traffic lights. But I think this is odd, since (as far as I can tell) the same logic that justifies traffic lights justifies the Affordable Care Act as well. (I'm fine with this, being a liberal. But my libertarian friends are not. I've never seen what the difference is supposed to be.)
A good set of traffic laws is good for everyone. A bad set (lights red for all parties 9/10 of the time, speed limit of 1 mph, the side of the street you can drive on changing from minute to minute) would be terrible. A good intellectual property system is good for everyone, since it rewards innovation. A bad system (vague patents that last forever, the right to copyright words like "the", what have you) would be terrible. 
This is why it's good to be wonky, rather than reflexive, in ones political opinions: to know who actually cares about writing good regulations rather than bad ones, and to vote for them. It's also why I can't answer a question like "regulations: good or bad?"

Hi. If I were you, I would do three things with that money. First, learn a really useful trade, which will pay you serious returns down the line. If you need to pay for a course, or for supplies, that's the best use of your money, imho.
Second, if you want to buy some BTC, then do it. If you want to speculate as a hobby, and you can afford to lose the money, then go for it. But remember a couple of things. First, the world of day-trading is full of very smart people whose job it is to do this, and who have access (through that job) to all kinds of resources that the rest of us lack. And while you seem to be quite smart, judging by the questions you're asking, you probably don't have nearly as much time to devote to this as they do. That means that they will probably win, and you (and I) will probably lose. If you want to invest in bitcoin, read up on it first, and then either adopt day-trading has a hobby that you don't expect to profit from, or else buy some BTC and put it aside.
But be really clear: BTC is *not* a sure thing. It's wonderful conceptually, but it's a long way from conceptual coolness to actual widespread adoption.
Third, if you want to invest, I wouldn't put all of it in BTC, or any cryptocurrency. Passively managed low-fee ETFs are diversified by their nature, and while it's really up in the air whether your 19 year old self will thank you for getting into BTC, it's a lot more likely that your 65 year old self will thank you for setting aside money early so that you can take advantage of compounding rates of return.
Good luck, and welcome!

You are unfamiliar with, say, people holding off on buying a computer when a newer and cheaper model is expected? 
Anyways, what I was objecting to was the part of the quote about not buying things you don't "really need". This is just ludicrous. (No one, for instance, "needs" a "middle-class car.") Any account of real needs that isn't just what one requires for survival is going to have to take into account the cost of what one is considering buying, including opportunity costs, time, etc. And if one does take those things into account (which it would be insane not to), then it might very well matter that you expect the cost of something to be cheaper later.

Like so: 200 bits private
I think you got 200 bits from someone else. That means you have maybe twelv e cent s or so. But the great thing is that if you just want to set up a wallet, transfer BTC in and out of it, and generally figure out how all this stuff works, *the amount is irrelevant.* 
People tip here all the time, for all sorts of reasons, but this is, imho, one of the best.

So, to whoever downvoted me: Consider Gaddafi's record in Libya. Here's Amnesty International's report on him from 2011: "The authorities restricted rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly and repressed virtually all dissent. Hundreds of prisoners continued to be arbitrarily detained on security grounds, including some who had been acquitted by courts or had completed prison sentences, although releases were reported. Foreign nationals suspected of entering Libya irregularly were subject to indefinite detention and ill-treatment; they included refugees and asylum-seekers. At least 18 executions were reported. The government failed to disclose the findings of an investigation into an incident at Abu Salim Prison in 1996 when hundreds of inmates were alleged to have been killed by security forces, and took no action to provide justice for victims of gross human rights violations committed in the 1970s-1990s."
Putin is a thug who steals his people's wealth and redistributes it to whoever he happens to favor at the moment. The people he doesn't favor wind up stripped of their assets, or in prison. Dissent is repressed. He starts wars to distract his people, who God knows have suffered enough over the years.
Madoff stole all kinds of people's savings, savings that they had worked hard for all their lives. A lot of his victims had retired, thinking that they had enough to live on now that they were seventy or eighty and no longer working. Oops!
When these people are able to take the money they have stolen or extorted and keep it safe, it not only allows them to escape the consequences of their actions; it makes being a dictator or a scammer more attractive to others. 
Is anyone here hoping that whoever ripped off BitStamp gets to keep the money he stole? Or that Mark Karpeles and Josh Garza will be able to enjoy a pleasant retirement in some sunny, expensive location, thanks to untraceable money? Would you think this if it was *your* money they stole? 
But Putin and Gaddafi stole more than money. They stole lives. 
Stalin justified his crimes by pointing to the marvelous future that, according to him awaited Russia, if only its people would just bear a few more decades of immiseration and gulags and slavery. I've always thought that the best way not to turn out like him is to refuse to accept or assist very concrete evils, especially evils visited on *other* people, for the sake of speculative future benefits that might or might not materialize. 
For this reason: no, I don't think it would be a good idea to try to sell Putin or Gaddafi or Madoff or Rumsfeld on Bitcoin as a way of protecting their assets. Let them figure that stuff out for themselves, without our cooperation.

To me, the part that made no sense was this: "“Blockchain technology could favour the emergence of alternative risk management models shifting away from risk pooling, the predominant model in insurance,” the report said. “Such blockchain-based risk management models could include self-managed or administered risk protocols, peer-to-peer insurance platforms and even fully funded solutions.”"

A wallet is a set of addresses that give you the right to move or spend bitcoin. In what follows, I'll refer to them as keeping money, though what they actually do is give you the right to spend and move that money. That said:
 
There are wallets on the web (where someone else keeps the money, sort of like a bank), wallets on your own computer or phone (where you keep the money), and various forms of "cold storage" (where cold means: not connected to the internet.) These include dedicated devices (e.g., Trezor), and paper wallets, which are about as low-tech as you can get. Note that the fact that someone cannot hack your paper wallet over the internet, because it's a piece of paper, does not mean that it's safe: you might lose it, run it through the laundry, etc. 
In my opinion, it's best to start out slowly and get comfortable with bitcoin. To that end, here's a small tip: 200 bits If you follow the instructions that the bot will hopefully add as soon as I post this, you will link your Reddit account to Changetip, Changetip will create a wallet for you, and it will collect this tip. Changetip's wallet isn't good to have as your main wallet over the long haul -- you do have to trust Changetip with the money, it has limits on how much you can keep there ($25), etc. But it's fine for the amount I tipped you, which is all of six cents. 
The reason for a tip of this size is that it allows you to play with it. Create a different wallet, and now you can move your 200 bits into it and see how it works. When someone first tipped me, I was able to understand things a lot better than I had just by reading. And because it's such a tiny amount of money, you don't really have to worry about losing it etc.
@_date: 2015-01-26 05:41:11
So, as someone who used to be a n00b: Circle and Coinbase are the two most established places to buy and sell BTC, at least in the US. BitFinex, BitStamp, OKCoin, etc. are exchanges, which means that they are more focussed on people who want to speculate and daytrade. I would not advise doing that unless you have daytraded elsewhere, and maybe even not then, since the BTC market seems to be manipulated and, um, devoid of the "fundamentals" that traders are interested in. 
The big news now is that Coinbase will announce tomorrow that it will also be an exchange, and (first time ever) a US-based regulated exchange. I would wait to see how this shakes out. 
Once you buy BTC, and if you're not interested in daytrading, it would be a good idea to move your btc out of web-based wallets. The reason for this is that if you keep your btc there, someone else controls your money, and if they go bankrupt, decide there's some problem with your account, etc., you're screwed. Whereas if you control your wallet, this is not a possibility.
If you tell us what platform you use (PC? Mac? Android? iPhone?), we can tell you which wallets are best. Alternately, once you acquire enough btc, you might consider a Trezor, which is a hardware device that keeps your btc very securely. Also, a paper wallet, but while they are easy to make and cost nothing, my sense is that they are hard to spend from.

@_date: 2015-05-15 03:04:08
Once upon a time, he sold physical miners and hosted mining. There is some debate about how real the hosted mining was, but at least the physical miners were real. 
Then, even though he had only ever sold miners made by other people, he announced the Vaultbreaker, a miner more powerful than any other comparable miners out there. As it happens, his company was really running out of money around then, but pre-orders for the Vaultbreaker solved that problem. Only one little difficulty: as far as anyone can tell, there were no Vaultbreakers. (I don't think anyone has ever seen one to this day.) 
Perhaps to get out of this problem, and to keep the cash rolling in, Garza then invented the Hashlet: a share in (alleged) cloud mining. It had various flavors, and paid out at first, like most Ponzi schemes. People bought lots of Hashlets. (And, providentially, lots of people who had pre-ordered Vaultbreakers switched their orders to Hashlets.) But then that money started running out as well, and the payments dropped: it's hard to keep up mining payments when they are not backed by actual miners. 
So Garza invented Paycoin, which was going to be a revolutionary coin that (a) would be backed by a $100million floor, so that its value could be preserved, and (b) would have widespread merchant acceptance. (I think he mentioned Amazon, Macy's, Target, and Walmart.) Cryptocurrency for the masses! "The People's Coin"! Instead of getting paid in money, owners of Hashlets got paid in Hashpoints, which could be converted into Paycoin when it went live, and which had the added advantage of costing Garza nothing. 
Then Paycoin went live, and the price crashed. At that point, a number of things became clear. (1) There was no $100 million dollar fund backing it. (2) There were no agreements with Amazon, Walmart, etc. (3) There was no sign of most of the other things Garza had promised (debit card, etc.) (4) Basically, it was a scam. 
Since then, the price has continued to fall (except for the last few days), and there has been a lot of drama. The SEC is investigating, Garza was pushed out (or, as he describes it, things were stolen from him), lots of squabbling over the carcass of GAW and XPY. Every few weeks, Garza promises some Big New Thing that will turn everything around; if it materializes at all, it does so in a totally dysfunctional and/or pitiful form. Most of his followers are gone; it seems to be just a matter of time before some three-letter agency or other brings the hammer down.
In the meantime, a lot of people lost a lot of money on this.

To really ELI5: Suppose you think the price of BTC is going to fall. (You can do something similar if you think it's going to rise; the details are different, but the role of leverage is not.) You sell one btc, thinking that you will by it back at (what you think will be) the lower price, and pocket the difference. Yay! But you think: even if it falls a lot, my profits will still be limited, because I only have one bitcoin to sell. How much nicer it would be if I had ten! Then I would have ten times the profit. But alas I only have one.
But suppose someone offers to *lend* you nine bitcoins, using your one bitcoin as collateral. Then you can sell all ten, wait for the price to drop, buy all ten back at the lower price, give back the nine you borrowed (plus some interest, but let's forget about that for now.) You get to keep the profit from *all ten bitcoins*, even though you only had one. How cool is that?
The downside, of course, is that you might be wrong about the price going down. Suppose you borrow the nine bitcoins, sell them (plus your one bitcoin), *and then the price goes up.* Now you need to buy back the nine bitcoin that you borrowed, but at a *higher* price. Moreover, if you hadn't borrowed the nine, it would take a really big move to wipe you out, but because you need to buy back nine bitcoin in order to repay your loan, it only takes a 10% rise to wipe you out completely.
So, basically: when you trade using borrowed money/coins ("buying on margin"), the profit is multiplied if you guess right, and the loss is multiplied if you guess wrong.
Most people do this kind of borrowing on an exchange. If you make this kind of a trade and it goes wrong, you can put up more money as collateral and hope for the best. (Though of course this means that if things keep going wrong for you, you lose even more.) But if you either can't or won't do this, the exchange will shut your loan down when you have lost your whole collateral. No more hoping for things to turn around: your position is liquidated to repay your loan.
That's what happened in the OKCoin thing you cite.

One issue: credit card companies offer all sorts of benefits beyond cashback. These benefits are paid for by the people who don't pay their balance every month, thereby incurring fees, and are gained by those who do pay their balance in full. If BTC got serious discounts, those discounts might outweigh the benefits of credit cards. 
But be aware that the people who pay their balance in full, the people you're saying might not need credit cards, are the people who profit most from them.

I suppose it might be coincidence that the BTC market is tanking just now, but then again it might not.

You can buy bitcoin quickly with a CC. The problem is (at least on Circle, which is what I use) that a lot of the CC companies regard buying BTC as a cash advance, and charge their cash advance fees on it. I'd look into what these fees are (I never do cash advance); I suspect they'd eat up the discount.

You were just tipped, via a program called Changetip. You can ask the changetip bot to tip someone some amount of bitcoin, but they have also set up some words that correspond to sums. Donut is one. There's a list here:

The great thing about tips (speaking as someone who stopped lurking and started being active because of a tip) is that they allow you to play around with bitcoin without (a) having to figure it all out first, (b) decide whether you want to give out your bank account info in order to buy bitcoin, or (c) worry about losing it. (The tip you got is enough to play with, move from one wallet to another, etc., but not enough to really worry about, unless you are really desperately poor.) So you can explore without having to commit yourself in some serious way.

As someone who has been watching this for a while in horrified fascination, my best guess is: he's basically a salesman, and while good people in sales generally tell the truth, because then their customers tend to trust them, some of them acquire a pretty tenuous relationship with the truth, since there really are times (if you're a salesman and not, say, an engineer) when talking something up can create the enthusiasm you need to make it actually work out all right in the end. 
Start there, assume as well a pretty low level of knowledge of actual markets, coding, and other things one might think someone in his position should know about, assume further that the finances are bad and have been getting worse for some time, and I find things make a certain twisted kind of sense. You need to stop imagining that there's a well-thought-out plan behind anything, and start seeing things as a series of temporizing measures adopted in the hope that, if he can stave off the day of reckoning a bit longer, something will work out. 
Or, tl;dr: he might have started off being just stupid [Edit] and not particularly concerned with the truth [end edit], and devolved into a scammer in order to stave off the inevitable.
I also find it helps to make sense of things to assume that any step that requires Garza/GAW/Paybase to sacrifice BTC for XPY will not occur. (Why did his own stores never take XPY? Why, when the price of XPY went to a penny during the flash crash, did he not buy some with BTC to stop the bleeding? Etc.) 
Recently, it also helps to assume that he has next to no staff left. Many of his higher-level people have quit. People on hashtalk complain about things like the fact that the Paybase website still had Christmas decorations on it as of yesterday. It looks unprofessional, they say. I say: it looks like a company whose coders have quit.
If this is at all right, then suspending mining has to mean that the end is near. Some of those hashlet things were paying out *a satoshi a day*, and Garza could probably make enough just playing faucets to cover a decent number of them. 
The other thing, of course, is the XPY buyback plan, which is scheduled to start on Sunday (meaning: people get to start signing up for it then; actual payouts don't need to begin until April 1st.) When people sign up, that amounts to an assumption of liability by whichever company does the buyback. 
Also, a number of large blocks of XPY (hundreds of thousands) have been moved to exchanges in the past couple of days. I cannot myself read blockchain, but other people seem to think these come from the premine,  which is not supposed to move. 
All in all: should be an interesting couple of days.

If someone tipped you, they probably used Changetip, which is fine to use: you can link your Reddit account to it without linking anything else, and they do not sell your information or anything. If you do that, it will create a bitcoin wallet for you, and if anyone ever tips you again, that tip will be collected automatically. What you do with it after that is up to you.
Bitcoin itself is a very neat technology, and also a currency. You can use it to buy stuff now, or you can convert it to normal currency, or you can hold onto it. It is very volatile and just had a pretty huge crash in value, but if you only have a dollar that someone gave you, you probably won't worry about that. 
If you want to hold onto your bitcoin, you can either leave it in the Changetip wallet or else get a different wallet (Changetip is not really designed for holding all your money in, but again, if "all your money" is a dollar, it doesn't matter much.) People here can give you advice about which wallet is best, if you decide to go that route, but it will depend on what kind of computer or phone you want to keep it on.

Yes, there are. Saudi Arabia, which controls enough oil reserves to determine whether or not OPEC can decrease production, really, really does not like Iran. They also really, really don't like Syria, whose government is backed by Russia. Both Iran and Russia need the price of oil to be at a higher price than Saudi Arabia does in order to balance their budgets. Also, Saudi Arabia has more reserves (relative to its spending.) So Saudi Arabia can really stick it to two of its regional enemies. And as a further bonus, it will hurt various other competitors, like fracking in the US; however, since lower oil prices are on balance a benefit to the US (and also because we don't like Iran, Syria, or Russia either), it can do this without making us mad.

Just to be pedantic, the debt is not rising *exponentially*. Consumer debt is down 7.6% since 2008. (source:  
The federal deficit is falling very rapidly. "The deficit in FY 2014 fell to $483 billion, $197 billion less than the FY 2013 deficit and $165 billion less than forecast in President Obama's FY 2015 Budget. As a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the deficit fell to 2.8 percent [note 1], the lowest level since 2007 and less than the average of the last 40 years. In dollar terms, the FY 2014 deficit is the lowest since 2008." (source:

The blockchain did not offer a full exchange, last time I checked. Some people trade BTC. They are a lot less likely to succeed if they use, say, Local Bitcoin.
Of course they should remove anything they don't plan on trading to a wallet they control. But if they want the particular services that an exchange offers, they won't find them on the blockchain.

Honestly: none of us has any idea. We really don't. Some of us know this and some of us don't, but it's true. 
If your kids won't eat, sell. Otherwise, figure out what you can afford to lose, and act accordingly. But don't trust random people on the internet. 
If you fail to take that bit of advice, here's another: Bitcoin is very, very volatile. It could go to the moon. It could go to almost zero. No one really knows. So my approach has always been: treat it as a pure gamble. When I bought bitcoin (not that much, for this reason), I wrote the whole amount off in my mind, just as though I had set it on fire. If you're not willing to do that with your money, don't invest in bitcoin. 
But, as I said: don't trust me, or any other random person on Reddit. Look at bitcoin's historic performance (note that this chart opens on *one day*: look at the volatility before you click to one year, or all): 
and decide for yourself.

Garza said several things. One, that the price would be stable, because it was backed by around $100 million, which would enable him to maintain its value at $20/coin. Two, that it would be accepted by a lot of merchants, including Amazon, Target, etc. So it would be a stable cryptocurrency that could be widely accepted. Based on these claims, he got of people who were involved in his cloud mining to accept stakes in this coin instead of actual payment in bitcoin. 
When Paycoin launched, he seems to have tried to maintain the floor for a couple of minutes, but then given up. The price is now below $4. There is no merchant integration, except for a pepper company and a couple of other similarly tiny businesses. In fact, Amazon has said that anything like what he promised would violate their terms of service. I think he also promised a credit card, but that hasn't appeared either. His company's website (the cloud mining part) does not accept Paycoin. 
So, in a nutshell, people have been "paid" in a coin that turns out to have no use at all, so far. This speech was supposed to be accompanied by the rollout of new features which would vindicate everyone's trust. Except, oops: no speech. No new features last time I checked.

BTC.com is a domain that Josh Garza purchased. He periodically makes noises about some big new thing whose initials will be BTC (business technologies for cryptocurrency, or something like that.) So this redirection is no big deal.
The lawsuit is a big deal, and so is the mutiny in Paycoin. -- Long story short: there are these things called Prime Controllers, some of which stake at 350% a year, which is insane. Garza/GAW controlled most of them, at first, though it now seems he has lost majority control over them. In any case, this morning the non-GAW owners of prime controllers, many of whom were once affiliated with GAW, put out a ["Declaration of Independence"]( in which they proposed to cut the staking rate to 100%, which is still too high, but a real improvement. 
Garza [went ballistic]( on Hashtalk, wailing about how "this is the end of Paycoin." Paycoin promptly lost a third of its (remaining) value. He made dark noises about the people who wrote the declaration being about to do things that would bring the SEC down on their heads, and threatening lawsuits. The people who wrote the declaration had a Google hangout which Garza tried to get called off, and declined to participate in. 
Why anyone thinks Paycoin can be saved is beyond me, but apparently the non-GAW types are trying. Meanwhile, by various accounts, government agencies circle about ...

As Hand_Hook noted, for a source of income, you need a job. To see whether you think bitcoin would be a good investment, you should start by checking out its historical price data. See [here.](
As you may notice, it is very volatile, with big gains and big losses. 
There is a case to be made that bitcoin will increase in value. There is also a case to be made that it will not. Both are, imho, very speculative. If you want to learn about this for its own sake, go for it. If you want the equivalent of a $500 lottery ticket, also go for it. If you want something you can count on, I don't think this is it. 
That said, you can buy btc in much smaller amounts, which will help you learn about it, if that's what you want to do.

Look: there are laws governing who can contribute to candidates in federal races. It doesn't matter what currency you use, or for that matter whether you use currency at all. If you give someone a bunch of cash, you need to fill out a form stating who you are, what your profession is, etc. If you lend a candidate your private plane, or provide some other service beyond just volunteering (i.e., if you cater a fundraiser), you have to fill out the same form. 
Moreover, the candidate has to exercise diligence to make sure that contributions are not coming from foreign sources, people who are just being used as conduits for someone else's money, etc. (I.e., if I want to circumvent donation limits by having ten of my closest friends "donate" the maximum amount allowed by law, and then repaying them out of my bank account, that's illegal.) 
Again: the currency doesn't matter. If you're not a US citizen, you just broke the law, and so did Rand Paul, if he accepted your donation and does not make every effort to ensure that bitcoin donations are from citizens.

Consider the barriers to entry for most people: they have to figure out what bitcoin is. They have to figure out how to set up a wallet. They have to figure out how to get some bitcoin, and who they trust to either meet in a Starbucks and hand over money to or give their bank or cc info to. They have to figure out basically everything. And it can look pretty daunting from outside. 
Tip them, and they already have some money, in a basic wallet. This makes it much easier for them to figure out the rest, especially since they will have some to play with and experiment on. 
This is, imho, one of the really under-appreciated aspects of Changetip, one that people just don't see when they just think of it as throwing tiny sums of money at people on the internet. It makes getting into bitcoin almost completely painless. And that matters.

Hmm; where are you getting that? As I read it, he's saying that if you're motivated by profit, then whether you choose to stay around and profit from your reputation as a trustworthy intermediary or vanish with the money depends on how much you can get for these two options, and that the first of these can be affected by law enforcement. 
Certainly I don't see anything problematic about saying: markets for drugs, especially online markets where you might know only the virtual identity of a vendor (and so can't easily go after that vendor personally), will be easier to scam than legal markets, since a lot of the options that I have if you e.g. sell me a defective car are not open to me if you sell me a defective product that is also illegal. (No going to law enforcement, credit card chargebacks, etc., etc.) And therefore, I would think, the role of trust becomes much greater than it is when I buy a car or a TV.

Read this article about the state of bitcoin mining. Pay attention to the picture at the top. 
Then, check out mining calculators like these: 
Note the part where the first tells you how long it would take to break even, and the fact that for all the miners, that time is 'infinity'.
Also: is someone else paying for your electricity? If not, lucky you! If so, you would be stealing from them, and probably in quantities sufficient that they would notice.
@_date: 2015-03-25 19:20:23
Before you invest in anything, looks at its value over time. A chart for bitcoin is [here.](
If you look at it, you will see that bitcoin is very volatile, and has lost an enormous amount of value over the past year or so. None of us really has any idea whether it will continue to go down, or stage some sort of a comeback. (Though since this is a bitcoin forum, most of us like bitcoin and hope for the latter.) 
This means that it's a very risky investment. It's always a good idea to diversify your investments, but it's an especially good idea not to put everything in something like bitcoin, which is obviously very risky and very volatile. 
I'd go with index funds, and maybe a small amount of bitcoin as a sort of gamble, like buying a lottery ticket. 
Also, if you invest in funds, be very aware of the fees. They look small, but can become significant over time, since they compound. Pick a basic index fund with low fees, and don't bother with active management: most traders do not beat the market consistently. 
(Also, if you are tempted to try day-trading: be aware that there are a lot of very smart people who do this for a living, and have institutional resources behind them. You might be smarter than they are, for all I know, but if you're sane you will not focus as hard as they do. So don't bother.)
Good luck!

If you sign up with Changetip (which is simple; you just need to link your Reddit account and it will collect the tips people have given you), then you will have a wallet with Changetip. This is fine for the amounts you've been tipped so far, but it's not designed or particularly well suited for use as your main wallet. (For one thing, Changetip holds the keys, and while they've always been trustworthy so far, if they e.g. go bankrupt, there goes your bitcoin); for another, they have limits on the amount you can transfer into a Changetip wallet, and other things that are, again fine for holding small amounts to tip with, but not so fine for your main wallet.
Now that you've got some bits, though, you can create a different wallet and transfer them into it. People here can recommend wallets if you let us know what platform you're using. One good thing to know: some wallets require that you download the entire bitcoin blockchain, which can take forever. This is not necessary, unless you feel like doing it.
@_date: 2015-03-13 18:50:38
breadwallet is good. It, like other wallets where you hold the keys, is better for storing your bitcoin than Circle or Coinbase or any other wallet where you don't, since you don't have to worry about someone else going bankrupt, deciding they don't like the look of your transactions, etc., and freezing your account. 
On the other hand, you do have to worry that you will do something dumb. So if you haven't written down your passphrase for breadwallet, preferably several times in several places that you will not forget and no one else has access to, do it now.

If you're going to ban anything, ban giveaway threads that require someone to go to a different (or: commercial, or something) website. Banning giveaways as a whole, including the kind run by users who just say 'hey, anyone want some bits?', knocks out the simplest way for people who are curious about bitcoin but don't know how to get any, or whether to trust e.g. Circle and Coinbase, from getting a few bits to experiment with. 
That's how I started. I'd hate to see this way of getting one's feet wet banned, especially since you can achieve your goal (not letting companies bribe people to visit their site) in a much more targeted way. 
That said, if people are willing to visit a website for bits, is it our job to stop them?

I had completely forgotten about this, so I wasn't expecting anything,  but just in case someone else needs it: you've formatted this wrong. Check the Changetip sub, or any of the other people who came and tipped on your thread, to see the right syntax. I.e., here:

Because prices do not vary directly with the size of the money supply. For one thing, the money has to actually circulate. (And I'm not confusing money supply with monetary base; if a company gets paid a certain amount and sits on it rather than spending it or investing it, it will not contribute to inflation, at least not directly. I'm making a point about the velocity of money, if you want to use technical terms.)
@_date: 2015-03-23 15:17:29
For one thing, this isn't bitcoin. (It's relevant to this sub, insofar as it is, because GAW used to sell bitcoin miners, and then cloud mining.) For another, how many of us, exactly, are supporting this?

The bot does default to the lowest amount. The only times I've ever seen it tip an amount larger than someone intended involve either typing in the larger amount by mistake or doing the following: (a) you type in what you mean to tip, but misspell it, and also inadvertently use a moniker. I.e., you mean to tip 250 bits, but you say 250bitts (or something) by mistake, and also use a word like 'pizza'. Since the bot only detects one amount, that's the amount it tips.

If you read the article, it's about a payment processor integrating with BitPay, which means that any merchant who uses that payment processor will be able to accept btc. For the merchants, it's painless, and they can, and probably will, convert almost all of it to fiat. But for the payment processor to integrate its system with BitPay is not easy, or cheap, or a mere pass-through.

To engage with the arguments against bitcoin, you really do have to engage with the arguments for the claim, which is almost universally accepted among economists, that deflation really is bad. That's a serious argument. It's not about "the technical limitations of bitcoin", but not every argument against bitcoin has to be technical. If it would, in fact, be an economic disaster, leading to a lot of idle capacity and unemployed people, that's a pretty serious argument.
Argue against it if you like, but dismissing it as not a real argument is silly.

Do you mean an annual fee? Lots of cards don't have those, including all of mine. Do you mean fees for e.g. late payment? It would be astonishing for a cc company not to have those. 
I pay my balance in full every month. I pay no fees at all. I do, of course, pay slightly higher prices because merchants have to pay their fees, but that would be the same whether I had a credit card or not.

This would be a terrible, terrible thing if wages (and Social Security, and basically everything else) had not gone up at the same time. 
The really nasty period has been the last few decades, when wage growth has not remotely kept pace with productivity. Inflation has been pretty low during this period, but it has hit a lot harder than it would have one had wage growth kept up. For some of the periods when this chart shows SCARY SCARY INFLATION!!!, average people were doing pretty well, since their wages were rising as well.
Honestly: its as though people don't recognize that there is more than one thing going on in the economy.

An APR is an annual percentage rate *of interest*. If I paid my credit card late, I would be charged the APR. Because I do not pay them late, I am not charged the APR. So if I buy something for $X, I am charged $X. (The one exception is cash advances, but I don't use those either, except when I'm abroad.)
I have AmEx, the Visa card my credit union gave me, another Visa that had quite good rewards the last time I checked, which was a couple of decades ago, and a Discover card. No fees on any of them.

Actually, you can collect it just by linking Changetip to your Reddit account. Changetip will then set up a wallet for you. It's not a good wallet to use permanently, or as your main wallet, partly because it's third-party (you don't control the keys), and partly because it has various limitations due to the fact that it was designed for tipping. (I.e., you can't deposit more than $25/day, if memory serves.) 
But it will definitely do while you get started. And moving your tip from the Changetip wallet to a different wallet is useful for seeing how this stuff works.
@_date: 2015-02-19 03:43:14
I see you already got a tip. Have another: 200 bits Now that you've got these, you presumably also have a Changetip wallet. (If you're wondering whether to link your Reddit account to Changetip: they are a reputable company. If you have any appreciable amount of btc, create your own wallet; with my tip and the one you got previously, though, Changetip is fine, since if they absconded with your funds, or were hacked, or whatever, you would not have lost much.)
Take these tips, and play with wallets. Don't bother with the ones that require you to download the entire bitcoin blockchain; that's not necessary. I use breadwallet on iOS; I have heard good things about Armory and Mycellium. If you tell us what platform you're using, we can give you advice. 
But take the tips, play around without having to worry about security, see how it works, and: welcome!
@_date: 2015-02-23 16:28:51
Changetip works fine, as long as the person making the gift actually has the money. (There are a few other rules, like 'no tips over $25'; this enables an even worse kind of trolling, in which someone appears to send you a thousand dollars, or something, and nothing happens. These rules make sense; being a jerk like the person who just trolled you is the problem.)
@_date: 2015-02-09 01:18:03
If you have these, why not try moving e.g. the contents of your Changetip wallet into Coinbase? That would let you see how it works (at least, at the level you really *have* to know in order to use it, as opposed to the more complicated underpinnings.)

Once upon a time, Josh Garza and his company, GAW Miners, sold rebranded miners. Then when individual mining became less profitable, he started a cloud mining service. (There were always questions about whether or not his miners actually existed.) Then, when that became less profitable, he said that he was going to start a new coin which would be stable and widely accepted, and offered people the chance to convert their BTC mining contracts into contracts to mine this new coin. He said it would have a $20 floor backed by a $100 million fund (of whose existence there is no evidence), and would be accepted by a bunch of major retailers including Amazon, Walmart, etc. (who have since denied having any plans to accept the coin.)
Surprise, surprise: when the coin (Paycoin) came out, Garza tried to maintain the $20 floor for a couple of minutes, but then it began its long plunge down. (It's now worth about a dollar; why it's worth anything at all is a mystery.) He then promised a buyback program, whereby people could put their Paycoins in escrow for an unspecified period of time and (eventually) get $20 back. But there were never any details about this program and its terms, and when the signup date arrived, he put it on hold indefinitely.
Meanwhile, he suspended all cloud mining without warning or explanation, and a bunch of his staff has left. No one seems to be developing the coin, and his attempts to add features have been laughable. (The best was when he tried to add the ability to buy gift cards; people who had been waiting to have *any* use for their Paycoins bought a bunch, and because all their coins were suddenly being sold for BTC in order to buy the gift cards, the price crashed to about a penny, and the gift card program was suspended indefinitely.) 
Also, there have been reports (e.g. in Coinfire) that he's being investigated by the SEC. Also also, there turned out to be several staking wallets, controlled by GAW, which were staking at a much higher rate than everyone else's (350%, but much higher due to compounding.) Coins from these wallets moved to the exchanges last week; there was an uproar, and GAW claims to have destroyed them, but as always, it's not at all clear that this is true.
Hashtalk, the GAW forum, used to be full of people who struck me as delusional; I just checked back there, and it's a ghost town. 
The mystery, to me, is who is propping up the coin's value. It should be nearly zero (not actually zero only because I suppose it might have a curiosity value, like those trillion dollar Zimbabwean bills.)

The government does not need to own something to tax it. I.e., (normally) city governments tax real estate, even though they don't own that. They can also tax things they don't support; one of the points of the tobacco tax is precisely to discourage people from using tobacco.
If we're talking about the US, they get this right from the fact that the people who put the taxes in place are our elected representatives, and under the constitution they have this power.

They actually don't charge a fee. They have announced that they will charge a fee for withdrawals (not for using the service per se), but the date at which it takes effect keeps getting pushed back. In November the fee was going to start on Jan. 1; now, it's sometime in the summer.

Yes -- it's all part of the fun. I got my first btc via a tip, then transferred it to Circle (and was amazed at how easy it was); then, after a bit when I felt more comfortable with bitcoin in general and had acquired enough that I didn't feel comfortable leaving it with any third party, transferred it to a wallet I controlled. You can transfer them; the transfer initiates instantly, and the BTC is usually available to spend within 15 minutes. (Google "Bitcoin confirmations" to know why.) 
Circle has always been fine for me: my purchases are instant, my transfers always go through, everything is great. They did ask me to verify my bank account, but that was only because I didn't want to do this via CC (fees.) 
If you haven't tried Changetip, it's fun. When you get the tip that I am about to send you, you will get a message telling you how to set it up. It's easy and painless -- you just have to link your Reddit account to it; no other personal info (except maybe email address) required. Then you can fling small sums of money about with abandon. :) 
Welcome. 300 bits @_date: 2015-02-21 18:20:28
Who's forcing anyone to do anything? Anyone who wants to can e.g. PM a user they want to tip and ask for a public address, and then tip them. What makes Changetip easier is not that this sub has somehow decided that Changetip is The Way Tipping Has To Be; it's that Changetip set up its bots to spot tipping comments, and created the machinery to make those comments translate into tips. If you want to do something similar, nothing is stopping you.
@_date: 2015-02-19 04:40:57
I'd advise starting small, for the reasons i mentioned. You can get used to it, see how it works, etc., without worrying about losing your money, since it will be a small sum. I use breadwallet (iOS); other people can tell you what's good for other platforms. When you feel comfortable with it, and if $500 is a significant sum for you, try either paper wallets or Trezor. (Paper wallets require more understanding, but are basically free; Trezor is more user-friendly, but costs money.)

Whoa: good for Changetip, and good for you.
@_date: 2015-02-27 06:48:51
It wouldn't. One great thing about having your own currency is that you get to have your own monetary policy. Having btc as your currency would make that impossible. If you wanted not to have the ability to have your own monetary policy, maybe because you had been irresponsible in the past, you'd be better off pegging your currency to the USD, which is a lot more stable than bitcoin.
There are lots of good things about bitcoin, but its ability to serve as a national currency is, at the moment, not one of them.
@_date: 2015-02-18 22:55:08
You can buy bitcoin on Coinbase or Circle. If you only buy a little, you can play around with it: install a wallet or two, move it around, see how it works. Then you can decide what wallet works best for you.
Security depends on how much you have, and how badly you'd mind losing it. I got my first bitcoin as a tip: it was 100 bits, which was then worth around 3 cents. It would have made no sense to get deeply invested in security, except maybe for the educational value. (I don't hire armed guards to protect my pocket change, either.) 
This is another reason to start by buying a small amount: you can get comfortable with it, try making a paper wallet or using some other security provision, see how it goes, etc., before rather than after you have enough bitcoin that it would be terrible if it were stolen.

Seriously: you think Changetip users are chumps because (a) you don't like their name, (b) you don't like their logo, and (c) you haven't bothered to figure out that you can change the currency things are displayed in in the account settings? And from this you conclude that Changetip is going to do something that their terms of service rule out? And from *this* you conclude that people who are doing something they like for free are chumps?
For my part: I would never have gotten into bitcoin without Changetip, since it was my first tip that let me play around and see how things worked, without which I would never have felt comfortable enough to actually buy some. Changetip seems to me to be ideal for letting the bitcoin-curious play around with a sum of money that's too small to worry about, and that doesn't require that you jump through hoops to verify your identity.

They are worried about where the money came from, and specifically whether it came from criminal activity. 
Also, to say that this is a form of capital control because one thing one might do with money in a bank is send it overseas is like saying that the requirement that you verify your identity before getting a passport is a form of capital control, since after all you might take some money out of the country when you travel overseas.

Sure. And it is my strategy. I'm here, I majored in and now work in an intensely male-dominated field, I was the first woman hired in a department that had always been all-male, and got to try to convince them, in a nice tactful way, that I was not their mother (most of these guys did *not* like their mothers), and I was not going to appear in the workplace waving bloody tampons about, etc., etc. 
I'm fine with that. (Not that it's not annoying on occasion.) 
I just wanted to say: if you want to encourage widespread adoption of bitcoin -- and who among us doesn't? -- then the existence of these trolls matters. Because while I have a thick skin, not everyone does. And the fact that a non-negligible minority of people here -- on what I would assume is one of the more obvious places to learn about bitcoin -- post genuinely offensive comments, and probably a majority seem to interpret 'there's a problem here' (true!) as 'women are demanding special treatment (false!) -- well, that doesn't help any.

I thought the topic of conversation was why more women weren't involved in bitcoin. For some reason you chose to interpret that as "women can't compete." Your issues with reading comprehension probably explain how you came to interpret feminism as a 'cancer'.

This is probably too obvious to mention, but using one of the established charity assessment programs would be an obvious start. Not trustless, but some of them are pretty good.

I didn't mean to say that you were responsible for the whole subreddit. But I do think that if you're wondering why fewer women get involved in bitcoin, you could do worse than to read over this thread and imagine that the comments made about women were made about you. I think that if you did that, you might be less inclined to think that anyone is asking for coaxing or special treatment.
I mean, suppose you read: "If humanity relied on the strategy of getting men involved for progress &amp; innovation we would still be living in grass huts", and "My boyfriend would rather look at porn and watch football", or "If men can't compete it does not fall on women's shoulders to lift them up", etc., etc., etc. Now imagine that people made *these same comments*, except sometimes with more ~~boob~~ dick jokes, *every single time* this topic came up. And imagine further that most of the people who didn't say that said things like: hey, if guys aren't interested, I guess they just aren't. You'd probably think: really? You think it's just a lack of interest, or the fact that no one is providing special coaxing and handholding?

This is a collective action problem. 
Example (familiar from the literature): suppose we are fishers who all benefit from having a healthy fishery. If we could act as one unit, we would choose to have limits on how much we could fish, so that the fishery would remain healthy, and there would be enough fish for all of us. But since we are individuals, it is in each of our interests to fish as much as we can. After all, if the fishery is healthy, then my overfishing will not have much of an effect on it, so it's all good; but if too many people are overfishing, then I might as well get what I can. -- If everyone thinks this way, then even though w would all prefer limits, it will be in the interests of each of us individually to undercut them.
Similarly: it is in the interest of [all people who own BTC] that the price of BTC be high. But it is in the interest of each of us, individually, to undercut bids that the market will not support. If we could all act as one, and if we all knew that no one would decide to sell his or her BTC for less than the price we agreed on, then this might work. But if we are all acting individually, it will be in each of our interests to undercut that price, and probably some (many) of us will.
Deciding to fix a price for BTC would also go against all principles of market economics, but your post seems to disregard them, so I am too. You might want to think about the drawbacks of a world in which there were people who wanted to buy BTC for less than a million dollars, and people who were happy to sell at that price, but were prevented from doing so by whatever enforcement mchanism you imagine.

All I can say is: I have transferred funds out of Circle on a number of occasions; I have never included transaction fees (not because I have opted out -- I would gladly pay miners a small charge for their trouble; it's just that I didn't know about TX fees the first time I did this); they have always gone through promptly. I assume that Circle pays them or something.
Note: my transactions have generally been small: mostly &lt;.05 BTC, never above .4. No clue if things work differently at higher levels.

If you just want a little to play with, so that you can see how it works, try this: 200 bits private.

Who needs coaxing? There is what appears to be a fact: that most users of bitcoin are male. This raises a question: why is this true? Read the comments in this thread and tell me it's just a lack of special coaxing or hand-holding. 
Personally, I don't care that about a quarter of the comments in this thread seem to be explicitly sexist or condescending to women. I think that those comments say more about the people who make them than about anything else, and those people do not interest me. But some women might, and if they did, and they read this thread, they might not stick around for the rest.
