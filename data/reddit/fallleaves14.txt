My comparison between internal exchange networks and lightning network was just that they are both off chain ways of moving bitcoin between people. Exchanges are centralized though and lightning is much more decentralized so don't agree with you there.
I know how blockchain technically works and agree that if it is not moved on the blockchain... It is not moved on the blockchain. That doesn't mean bitcoin can't be exchanged from one person to another in other ways. Physically exchanging paper wallets, trading on an exchange, or using tipbot services, are all totally valid ways of moving possession of Bitcoin for one person to another. They are also ways of exchanging BTC that are generally accepted as fine by both that BTC and BCH communities. Many BCH supporters draw the line with lightning network though and that's fine for them. I just don't share their concerns.
@_date: 2018-09-23 03:09:02
That's fine. But bitcoin dot com sells something called "Bitcoin Core" instead of Bitcoin and that is misleading. The BCH community in general supports that behavior so they are misleading.

Bitstamp or Coinbase. Buying with a credit card is very expensive so only do it if you need the BTC immediately. You can do a checking account transfer to Coinbase and purchase BTC in Coinbase Pro and then send to your private wallet all for no fees. Takes about 5 business days for the bank transfer but you'll save a lot in fees.

There are no such things as LN coins. It's Bitcoin locked into LN channels via smart contacts. It's still bitcoin even if it's not being moved directly in the main network. Exchanges move tons of Bitcoin everyday on their own internal networks and almost no one complains about these "off chain" transactions.
@_date: 2018-08-23 20:03:13
Haha! see! bitcoin is up about 100% from a year ago.

Litecoin is a fork of the Bitcoin software not the chain. They don't share the same history back to the genesis block.
Litecoin community is friendly to Bitcoin and sometimes acts as kind of a test net for future Bitcoin technologies like it did for segwit and lightning and currently testing atomic swaps.
Litecoin doesn't share the same proof of work algorithm with Bitcoin and compete directly for mining hash power.
Litecoin isn't engaged in a fraudulent social media campaign claiming they are the "real Bitcoin."
There is no Bitcoin Corporation.

You must have forgotten the part where they announced they would be providing their customers with their BCH but had no immediate plans to allow BCH to be bought or sold.... and then a few weeks later  did exactly that out of the blue with no warning and the BCH price pumped ridiculously in the day leading up to it probably allowing some insiders to make a lot of money. Yeah it's not that they offered BCH but how they went about it that made people mad.

Any sign shop that does ADA signage should be able to make you a small sheet with your key words on it in braille. You might even be able to get them done in a fire resistant material. Split your seed words into four groups and get them done by four different shops so no one place has all your words. Get 2-3 copies of each made. You can store your four sheets one each at a different safe deposit box. The other copies you can figure out how best to securely store. There's lots of ideas for that here on Reddit or just Google.
@_date: 2018-08-02 21:20:08
Because they don't need to. People value them enough to pay for the service. And judging by the transaction volume over the past year BTC, ETH, LTC, and Doge, are all preferred over BCH.
You ever hear of a loss leader? Miners let you take a spin with their shit coin for cheap hoping you'll like it enough to buy it. You got miners offering to burn BCH transaction fees (as minimal as they are) to boost the price of BCH and a development community begging miners to process zero free transactions. Now Bitmain has invented a new way to boost BCH price by burning BCH to create WHC worm hole coin. Do that long enough and you won't have any BCH left. 
To top it all off BTC and BCH fees are usually comparable at any given moment when measured in each unit's Satoshis which is the only fair way to measure them.... Especially since BCH supporters are dreaming of a flippening.

The technical answer to that is usually given as "longest chain with most proof of work" which is BTC with a huge lead in accumulated POW. It's unclear to me if that definition would even apply to an alt coin like BCH which intentionally split the chain under contentious circumstances.

You're getting downvotes because you're a new account asking the same questions "concern trollers" usually come with. Being a new account people don't want to risk wasting their time. The fact that you haven't responded to any of the responses to your comment also doesn't instill confidence that you're sincere.

No your the one who doesn't understand how domain registration and the whois listing works. Yes the domain was registered in 2008. The listing doesn't prove who originally owned the domain though. Ownership could have passed hands an infinite amount of times and all it would show is date of original registration and current owner.
Your claim that it was "REGISTERED in 2008 in KN" isn't proven by the info on that page for the reasons I just explained. But it also doesn't make logical sense because why would he register the domain in St. Kitts originally in 2008 a full six years before he gave up his US citizenship and bought a St. Kitts one?

The point of regular coinbase is that it's super simple. Anybody who has ever purchased something online will feel comfortable with it immediately.
Coinbase Pro you have to figure out how to make a limit purchase in a live marketplace which takes a little more effort.

I think they don't have fees for market orders in order to encourage people to use market orders which creates a better market by having people make a bet on which way the market is going to go in order to get their order filled.
Regarding why they don't charge fees for withdrawal I've wondered the same thing. My guess is that a Coinbase specific fee for withdrawal funds would piss off their customers. But in addition to no Coinbase withdrawal fee they also pay the Bitcoin transaction fee to the miners on your behalf when you withdraw so taking your Bitcoin is totally free. My guess for why that is is that they probably batch their outgoing transactions so it is likely too costly to them to keep track of and charge their customers the network transaction fee for individual transactions.

It was an overt attempt by the segwit2x backers to gain control of bitcoin development though. It wasn't a secret or all that grand but technically they were "conspiring" together to achieve this goal.
I'm sure a lot of them were also sincerely concerned about how best to scale bitcoin and thought that was the best approach. If the majority opinion had been strongly with them then the market would have punished BTC and strongly supported segwit2x or BCH but it didn't and doesn't.

880 x 25,000,000,000 (25 billion) = 22,000,000,000,000 (22 trillion)
You could also just multiply 88 x 25 which equals 2200 and then add the 10 zeros you didn't multiply. So 2200 with the extra 10 zeros tacked on is 22,000,000,000,000.

I don't really disagree with any of that. There are not a lot of things that have long term historical value to people.
In the future Bitcoin may increase the coinbase but that would only likely happen if there were circumstances that made it likely that doing so would increase the overall value of Bitcoin.

If you do decide to buy some just use coinbase pro. You can buy and transfer to a hardware wallet all with no fees by doing a bank transfer (free but takes a week), then a limit order to purchase (free), then transfer to hardware wallet (free because coinbase pays the mining fee).

No they can't. It takes much more than 51% to do a sustained deep reorg of the chain.
Besides, users are the ones who give value to Bitcoin not the miners. There would have to be a near super majority of users who wanted to coinbase to increase for that chain to have value. If there wasn't those users weighs just stay with the minority chain with the old 21 million limit, the new chain with the increased limit would have less value than they of chain, and miners would either mine at a loss indefinitely on the new increased supply chain or switch back to the more valuable chain.

You should educate yourself on what cypherpunks meant when they used the term "electronic cash" during the two decades prior to Satoshi inventing Bitcoin. It was a term of art with a different meaning than the way most people used it colloquially. 
Not running a full node means individuals have to rely on third parties to verify that the network is being run properly. Generally not a big deal for most people's day to day transactions but if we do get to the point where only a few mining companies or other larger entities have the ability to do that then we're effectively in the same position as we are with banks now and the main thing that gives Bitcoin value would be gone. 
People running full nodes we're part of the influence which got the segwit2x backers to cancel the 2x hard fork. I'd call those users influencing how the network develops a benefit to the network.

I think one important factor right now is simply security. LN developers are open about the trade-offs being made with the LN which is favoring speed and anonymity over security. Ten years on Bitcoin has a pretty well understood attack surface whereas the newer LN doesn't. So users who value security above speed works be more likely to transact via Bitcoin network and vice versa may be fine using LN most of the time.

He's butt hurt because his status as someone who made a ton of money while promoting Bitcoin early on didn't give him the power he thinks he deserved to influence Bitcoin development. It's not surprising to me that developers weren't very receptive to being told what to do by somebody who doesn't understand the technical underpinnings of Bitcoin. There is a strong faction within the big block proponents of which Roger Ver is a part who think that developers should be subordinate to miners and other large Bitcoin businesses.

Long time AJ listener here. I actually took him at his word for as long time when he repeatedly said "it's all documented folks." After all what normal person makes extraordinary claims without having the proof to back them up?
Spoiler alert: It's not all documented.
Some of what you/AJ say is true (ex. The secret government programs, WTC 7 weirdness, Bilderberg, Bohemian Grove) but if you've actually researched everything a lot of it isn't (all the climate change is a NWO conspiracy stuff, Newtown didn't happen just actors, Pizzagate, UN child sex trafficking and US social workers kidnapping and selling white blonde hair children, the US government importing illegals to increase Democratic voter rolls or as part of a UN plot to destroy American society, massive voter fraud in the US, massive welfare fraud in the US).
AJ totally lost it when he started licking Trump's ball sack.
PS... Don't even try telling me that AJ was just exercising free speech or giving an outlet for alternative explanations when it comes to Newtown. He very clearly said over and over again that he believed it was all a fake government operation intending to help take away your guns. He could have sent Joe Biggs or Leann Mcadoo to do some first hand investigating, interview parents etc., but he never did. I hope he is held responsible for what he has done to those parents. That alone should be proof enough for you that he is not a trustworthy person.

And I'll say for the third time that you are redefining the word "failed". Not maintaining the top spot is not equal to failed.
FWIW there is almost no metric by which BMW has ever "smashed Ford" into the ground. Ford currently does, and historically has, had higher market capitalization, higher revenue, and more automobiles sold per year then BMW. Ford recently has had better stats in those areas than Honda and almost nobody would consider Honda add having "failed". Even the larger auto makers like Volkswagen and DaimlerBenz aren't "smashing Ford" though they do have higher numbers in the stats I referenced.

I do like Bitstamp. I'll have to take a closer look at fees for both Bitstamp and Cash. Only reason I was leaning toward coinbase was it appeared I could do the whole transaction for totally free. Thanks again!
@_date: 2018-07-25 19:59:47
I'll look into that thanks! Can you transfer your BTC of theie platform or is it like Square Cash where you "own" BTC but can't actually do anything with it?
@_date: 2018-07-25 20:50:56
Cool somebody just said Cash let's you do withdrawals so that is promising. I don't like Coinbase's stance regarding BTC either hence my looking for alternatives. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-07-25 19:52:23
Thanks, totally agree with the importance of securing your own keys.
@_date: 2018-07-25 21:56:12
I'm pretty sure that BTC (and other cryptos Coinbase supports) transfers off their exchange (Gdax/coinbase pro I mean not regular coinbase) and into another wallet are free. Lots of threads saying they pay the BTC transfer fee and I'm pretty sure I read that on their site though I'm having trouble finding that info right now on my phone.

@_date: 2018-07-25 20:53:01
Hmmm... What is the fee for though? I was under the impression limit orders were free and Coinbase also paid the BTC transfer fee.
@_date: 2019-09-09 18:08:46
Oh so the bcash supporters who put together segwit2x did it so they could get segwit implemented but then decided to cancel it before implementing the block size increase. Got it. That makes a lot of sense! /s

I'll have to check it bitstamp options for funding and fees again because it's been a while. I've gotten smarter about fees since I've used them to purchase with a credit card.
@_date: 2018-07-25 21:12:53
I'll check it out thank you.
@_date: 2018-07-25 21:56:44
Thanks checking them out now.

Simply hard forking doesn't mean that a new coin is created as long as the rest of the ecosystem goes along with it. The current Bitcoin has hard forked once or twice without becoming something different. The bcash hard fork created a new coin because it was contentious and wasn't supported by the majority of the ecosystem. If Bitcoin is endangered by quantum computing then it is likely that hard forking to protect itself would be easily supported and it would still be Bitcoin.

Yes segwit2x was called off before the blocksize increase by the same people who put it together:
@_date: 2019-09-09 17:06:59
Remind us all again who wrote and signed the letter calling off segwit2x before the blocksize increase.
@_date: 2018-07-25 20:49:05
Oh really score one for Cash app than. I downloaded it a long time ago but have never used it. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-07-31 19:42:16
You can buy with a credit or debit card on Bitstamp as well. Never had a problem with them and they're based in Luxembourg.

That's a good goal in general when you're doing design.    Just cranking it out and steadily producing new work is a great practice.
I like your new design because it kind of reminds me of vintage 1980s Miami Vice. Also reminds me of the arcade game Cruis'n USA.

Ozinga Field. Says right on the sign.
@_date: 2019-05-09 22:08:50
Awesome job.
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:23:10
They were being downvoted because 3rd party payment processors, which is what is bent talked about here, don't need to wait for a confirmation on the blockchain before processing and authorizing the payment. The business model is they authorize and pay for the purchase and get paid a fee for doing that work and taking on the risk that any transaction may not be confirmed for some reason. Nobody is waiting in line for an hour.

Cool well welcome and congratulations on being the millionth subscriber ��
@_date: 2019-05-25 03:17:08
Ha ha seriously though had to look it up:
Ozinga Field is a baseball field located in Crestwood, Illinois. The stadium was built in 1999 and holds 3,200 people. It is the home field of the 2007 and 2008 Frontier League champions, the Windy City ThunderBolts.
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:18:26
Payment processors don't wait for the blockchain confirmation to take place before processing the transaction.
@_date: 2018-12-03 03:49:15
Congratulations this is quite a milestone.
@_date: 2019-05-05 18:11:56
Could be our maybe it had something to do with how you fund your purchase. Why don't you send your question to customer support or see if your answer is in an FAQ.
If you have Coinbase already I'm pretty sure you also have access to Coinbase pro so you can try it out. Like I said I've never had a problem doing what you're trying to do with Coinbase pro.
@_date: 2018-12-01 03:27:11
Nah. Simply supporting a blocksize increase doesn't make you a corporate shill and scammer. Supporting the corporate of takeover of development through efforts like segwit2x and BCH does.

According to them they were all banned here. Hilarious.

Roger Ver is also an early investor in blockchain.info. So somebody who actively hurts Bitcoin is involved in the two top wallets. Not great.
@_date: 2019-05-14 15:03:43
Yeah I see your point sorry about that.
@_date: 2018-12-31 22:16:17
Back in the day he used his access to blockchain.info user info to threaten a customer of his who wouldn't return $50 of BTC Roger thought was mistakenly refunded. Pretty interesting read and one of the many reasons Roger has a bad reputation.

To clarify I was saying they are great IF they don't check ID. Some do though.
@_date: 2018-12-30 00:40:33
Yes you can also get a coinbase account and using coinbase pro do the entire transaction with zero fees. Transfer from your bank account takes a week is free. Then do a limit order to buy with no fee. Then transfer off coinbase to your hardware wallet which is also free because coinbase pays the Bitcoin network fee for you.
@_date: 2018-12-30 00:37:02
ATMs are great if the fee isn't too high (less than 10%) and they don't do any KYC ID check.
@_date: 2019-05-05 17:42:33
Listen to the current What Bitcoin Did podcast series interviews which is all about lightning network.
@_date: 2019-05-05 17:41:04
I'm in the US and have never had a problem transferring from Coinbase pro immediately after purchasing. Are you using Coinbase or Coinbase pro? I also fund my account with a bank transfer so maybe that makes a difference.
