Honestly, aside from the unique properties, it was the beautiful design. Just how well all the legos fit together is sexy. I feel in love with the Bitcoin protocol Wiki. Going through the protocol one can quickly get a feel for how well the system is designed from day one. The reference implementation is clean and a lot of little optimisations were taken into account from day one.
I then started building my own protocol copying the Bitcoin protocol and gained a lot more respect for it. I always tried to implement chunks on my own with little research and ended up with complicated broken implementations only to come back to the Bitcoin protocol Wiki and found such elegant solutions that were uncomparably simple and more efficient then mine.

Sometimes it happens that you type the wrong password twice.
What did help me once is trying all combinations of a wrong password.
For each character in your password, erite down the characters close to it on the keyboard.
Now try all these combinations of words where one of the original chsracters is relaced by its neighbour on the keyboard.
If you checked all combinations where 1 character is reolaced, you can try for two at the same time. Problem is, the amount of combinations grts very large quicly. Usually one writes a program that checks the combinations and is able to check many more.

Hong kong is different thrn Venezuela. The economic state in Venezuela forced some to use Bitcoin. There is no hard data but the average volume in trading BTC did increase.

I think most people will get burned. This is kinda inevitable with all the price talk and the hope for a get ritch fast ending.
I was once like that, now I care less. My money is elsehwhere. I have some BTC I hope I never have to sell, it's not ment for me, its for my kids.
Moon or not, it will not matter to me, but It could save their life one day. The hardest part is coming up with a noncustodial way for them to get the BTC when in need.

They cant kill it but they can make it less attractive for most people. I am sure you can imagine how that wold happen. The way most people treat Bitcoin now is as an investment. If FIAT gateways are eliminated that entire idea falls apart. Bitcoin will still exist and serve its purpose for the people that need it but I do not think it would he as popular as it is right now.

You are in no way obliged to do soo. You are free to go, but while you study, usually students get jobs and then stay here due to how well some things are taken care of. The cities are clean, no crime, social security is very good ranging from kindergardens, free healthcare, penssion fund, etc...
We have a lot of researchers from the states that came here for invited lectures and simply decided to move their families even tho the pay check is super small relative to US. However, this is due to taxes that the employer pays which pretty much covers all expensses you might have regarding healthcare, education, etc ...

Honestly I don't know how Bitcoin does it. When I was setting up my p2p networking for educational purposes I implemented my own publish-subscribe model. All my nodes did was remember to not send the same message to the same node more then once. As far as I remember the network converged quite fast and I don't remember observing a node getting the same message more then 3 times.
The engineering way of thinking about this would be that network bandwidth isn't really a problem these days. It might make sense to lower the usage in case the network would run on something much slower then Ethernet ?

Bridging the information gap between the real world and digital is where the problem is, not the smart contract?
That being said, in a trully utopian world, one would not upload any documents. The car would report the damage it self with the sensors it has coupled with the proof of correctness. Theres quite a lot of work being done in the IoT field aiming at trusted computation enviornments where the ideas are similar as Intels Guard, a sensor reports values that can be trusted since tempering with the hardware taints the sensor readings.
Additionaly, contract can in some cases reverse transactions. In your case, an insurance company would provide a resolution based on provided documents and issue tokens in return but they could remain locked until the appeal period runs out like in traditional systems. If there is no appeal the tokens unlock. If someone appeals claiming the documents are fake and provides proof, the tokens can be taken away. In general, contracts can reverse transsctions as long as they are not spent?,
@_date: 2019-12-14 17:33:48

I think thats the point of these solutions. If you did atempt to sniff out the pvt keys, you would taint the sensor. I have no idea how the black box principle works here but I've heard of a few EU based companies thst were prearing to file patents for such solutions.
Assuming technology ever gets there, it would be a viable option. This is different then oracle networks where game theory assumptions drive consensus amongst nodes who preform the service of predicting  sensor values.

I did not say most EU countries are socialist. But most have free education including University. Healthcare is also free but we have a fixed amount we pay on monthly base. Same goes for penssion and other instruments thate are based on solidarity. 
There is a long list of countries including my own that offer completly free education from elementary to university including master degree. The list of EU countries that have free (payed by obligatory taxes) health care is much longer. Not to mention social mechanism that are in place to help people in trying to find a job or supporting children. Hech, we even help jounkies with monthly methadone doses and free food. 
Solidarity is not socialist. Most are capitalist in economic sense, but we did not forget how to care for others even when sometimes it seems like the other party is abusing it.
Also, I think education should be free. It should be in every countrie's interest to have educated people.

Depends on what's required to be considered a new technology. It is built using things we've known for decades. But until Bitcoin, we haven't put them together in this way. Bitcoin was the first "successful" implementation.  It is a method of storing data. It can be considered a database with some unique features that make it good for value transfer.
A lot of projects believe those unique properties could be used for other purposes. Hence, we have thousands of currencies/tokens/projects working on ideas to exploit these unique properties these "databases" provide.

If such action is not possible with Bitcoin then Bitcoin is the shitcoin when the vulnerability gets exploited. The hardfork can still happen. Developers simply asked exchanges, community, miners,etc.. to not go through the fork until they make sure the vulnerability does not influence any smart contract or until they fix it.
Even though you might argue the decision was made by only a few people, and hence governance is centralized. However, the centralized part just warned about the vulnerability, you can decide for your self if you want to update your node or not. So ultimately, the decision to fork or not will be made by the community?

While what you say might be true, consider that some of us observe the situation because it might very well be the first example of using Bitcoin out of necessity rather than an investment. I suppose people use it as hedge but the fact some stores started accepting is very interesting. For me, it shows a possible path towards a dream where Bitcoin becomes a world currency. Whatever the reasons may be, we are seeing a small scale test of how Bitcoin adoption can grow. Very interesting aint it?

Maybe not the beat approach, but we still gotta help. Most people do not fully understand the technology nor what it means to have a trully trustless system without a third party. 
Just figure if we want to see adoption grow, we gotta help people out on the tech side as well as understanding the beauty of it.
I do not have experience in setting Bitcoin payment systems but since you do, help the fella out and explain to him why Coinbase, even id easy, might not be the best idea. Maybe even  suggeat an alternative and help him set it up ;)
Im naive I know.

Is this going to be posted every week?

Yes, this is the perfect time to enter and short.

I aplaud you for the devils advocate approach here. It surely spiked a discussion even if some comments are borderline rage :)
Holding Bitcoin in a safe place is somewhat non-trivial, ETFs would at least make it easier with custody.

Looks great! Can you explain the technical side a bit? 
Machine learning is very broad.

Take over the world and a scam, both are extreme. The truth is probably somewhere in between.
Bitcoin does have a lot of potential to be both of the above. For a positive visionary, it is the missing peace the Internet needs. A common independent protocol for transferring value from and to anywhere and anyone. It could be used anywhere from personal banking to machine-to-machine payments. 
It's also a good hedge. Its funny what happens if you keep filling a finite bag (Bitcoin) with with infinite bag (Fiat) . Prices will generally go up indefinitely as more Fiat money gets printed.
I think we can all agree that it is not a scam (math doesn't lie) but at the same time it's (currently) not the currency to replace everything.
In 2012, the we might have had a debate weather Bitcoin is here to stay. Today, I think its clear it's not going anywhere.
The moon shot and get rich fast people are only natural. I don't think technology alone would be able to propel Bitcoin to where we are now. The fact it was and is a good investment is what ultimately drew interest, education and hopefully future adoption. Even the ICO phase was positive in that regard. It did finance a lot of research and development of ideas and prototypes even if most of them turn out to be crap.
