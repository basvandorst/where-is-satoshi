Kind of difficult getting past those gate keepers, isn't it?

Ya.. that will not happen. Allowing that to occur would be giving up the centralized authority that Core (and by extension Blockstream) control.


I do not believe this will happen, for if Core does acquiesce then they will be admitting that they made a mistake nearly two (2) years ago when this type of compromise was first suggested in the form of BitcoinXt (IIRC). Core cannot allow their authority to be questioned. 


Cool. Your proposal will likely get you nowhere. Have you been paying attention these past 2-3 years (it seems unlikely)?


&lt;shakes head&gt; So you want to continue to centralize development in one group?
I'm going to stop now.

LOL, thanks. You folks are really giving me some quality laughs today.

This is horrible I say. How dare someone post this out in the open for anyone to see??!! We should call out for all of these to be destroyed! No one should be permitted to take individual action on their own, that's for our overlords to decide!! Hail Blockstream!!! Hail Core!!!! /s
