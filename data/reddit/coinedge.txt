Last month my wife was watching a D-rated Lifetime movie. I tune out these movies and basically don't hear anything that's going on...just do my own thing... until I heard the word "Cryptocurrency". The villain in the movie was using cryptocurrency to hide whatever shady business he was doing. I sold some crypto not too long after that. Not solely due to that but let's face it, we're not exactly in the pioneer phase anymore.

My opinion is the states that consider it property or a collectible will impose sales tax on it. The states that don't shouldn't.
