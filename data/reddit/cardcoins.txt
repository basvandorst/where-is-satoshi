Okay, thanks for the heads up. FWIW, your competition coinatmradar has both "Other" and "Teller" sections. Good luck with your project!

Unfortunately the major exchanges who accept credit/debit payment in exchange for Bitcoin do not accept prepaid Visa/Mastercard/Amex gift cards. 
While our fees are not minimal, they are competitive with the rates you would get on P2P marketplaces that have order books where you can sell your Visa gift card for Bitcoin. Check us out, just make sure you have your receipt if you decide to use our services: [CardCoins](
Let us know if you have any questions!

Our fees are dynamic, but should usually be comparable or maybe even slightly lower than most cryptocurrency ATMs. You can always see our real-time price for every asset we sell right in the drop down menu. The price for your order is locked in when your gift card is charged.

We have an amazing compliance team that has done some incredible work behind the scenes to help make our service possible. There is a lot of information contained in your phone number which other services may not be utilizing the same way we do! That being said, the flipside is that you may find our initial limits are more restrictive than you're used to from other exchanges and we'll be rolling out higher volume tiers as soon as possible. Stay tuned!
@_date: 2018-10-23 18:45:08
It's our opinion that a sufficient number of these locations are compatible with our service, e.g. 99%, to warrant the statement we made and we stand by it.

How would you get your physical cash into your HitBTC account? 
@_date: 2018-10-23 23:33:53
Every Walmart and Walgreens have a wide selection of Visa, Mastercard and American Express branded non-reloadable gift cards that are eligible for use at CardCoins. We currently require our customers to confirm a phone number to purchase Bitcoin.

For those curious, our website is accessible from the following states: 
AK, AZ, AR, CA, DC, DE, FL, ID, IN, IA, KS, KY, LA, ME, MD, MA, MI, MN, MS, MO, MT, NE, NH, NJ, ND, OH, OK, PA, RI, SC, SD, TN, TX, UT, WV, and WY.
We'll be adding more states in the future! 
@_date: 2018-10-23 20:25:31
Our pricing is competitive with cryptocurrency ATMs and the ubiquity of locations compatible with our service makes it superior in our (obviously completely biased) view. The banks are, somewhat obviously, the ones responsible for making physical cash tender USD-&gt;BTC conversion extremely expensive. But the personal liberty achieved with cryptocurrency, once obtained, is worth every penny.
@_date: 2018-10-23 17:33:40
The states we don't support have more challenging regulations with regards to cryptocurrency businesses. We are working very hard to make our site accessible everywhere. 
@_date: 2018-10-23 19:46:21
The rate is currently set to CoinMarketCap +10%. 
@_date: 2018-10-24 00:47:00
All you need is a phone number! There is no registration required. 
@_date: 2019-11-14 18:32:20

Awesome! Make sure to keep the card, packaging and receipt for a smooth hassle-free transaction.
@_date: 2018-10-23 19:47:06
That's exactly correct. We are working closely with our compliance team to support higher volume tiers in the coming weeks. 
@_date: 2018-10-23 19:04:20
You're right! We should have written "almost every."
@_date: 2019-10-04 02:56:01
One small mistake! We are US based, not Canada. Thanks for making this :)
@_date: 2019-06-28 22:25:39
Thanks for the vote of confidence cointastical! You're exactly right, we don't actually attempt to settle the card's funds until after we have verified the legitimacy of your order. We're a federally regulated Money Transmitter so we would be held accountable for any sort of shenanigans that occurred through our service.
@_date: 2019-06-28 22:23:49
Hey there! We're happy answer any questions you have about our service. Our main advice to you is to make sure you carefully open your card's packaging and keep the receipt because it's required during your order process.

Cards that you don't have to register are generally a more pleasant experience. One Vanilla (Visa/Mastercard) or Vanilla Gift (Visa/Mastercard/Amex) are widely distributed and do not require registration. Do note that some retailers require a one hour activation period for the cards after purchase (e.g. Walmart, Family Dollar).
@_date: 2019-12-05 22:25:38
Not quite true!
We sell Bitcoin for prepaid Visa/Mastercard/Amex cards. For smaller amounts, all we require is SMS confirmation. You must have your receipt in hand and be prepared to take photos of the receipt and the prepaid card for verification. 
Please read our Terms of Service before using the site. While we don't do an age verification for smaller amounts, we only accept customers who are 18 and older.
