So wait...now you're publicly admitting to lying on an application for a bank account to utilize it for a money services business without disclosing it to the bank?
Are you also not registered with FinCEN? If you are, do you have a written AML agreement that you've disclosed to your bank (obviously not), filing and retaining CTRs and SARs as required, and asking for customer information pertinent to the Bank Secrecy Act, like requiring a SSN per the "travel rule" requirement for transactions over $3k?
So what you're PUBLICLY saying is...you're more than likely smurfing/structuring deposits into your bank accounts, to facilitate your illegal money services business, whilst not being registered (and perhaps not licensed if your state requires) and a handful of other money transmission violations you can LITERALLY go to jail for?
Man, honestly....some of you kids today are retarded. Is social media THAT important that you feel compelled to confess to your crimes and/or shady activities with it?
Like the moron in San Diego that got caught selling BTC from an undercover that said he was buying hash oil. **You will have the same fate if you don't stop talking so openly about your crimes.**
...and yes, believe it or not....what you are doing **is** illegal. Consult any lawyer with a background in money transmission if you don't believe me.
Goddamn amateurs, I swear.

Get over it, Wendy.

Cool story, bruh. 
You took the first step: Deleting this post...and public admission.
Second step: Stop telling other people what you do for a living....it will only come back to haunt you.
