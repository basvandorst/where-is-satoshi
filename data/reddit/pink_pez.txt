What is your box made out of and how big is it? Im really scared that if I was to put my rigs (I currently only have 4 with 6x amd rx570s) in a box it would dramatically decrease the airflow which would increase the temperatures of the cards dramatically which wouldn't be good. Im also scared that box made out of wood would catch fire.

Im actually considering renting student studio with electricity included in rent (aka free electricity) from HOAS (the organisation providing student housing in the capital area). 
Im currently living with my friend in three room apartment. I would officially "move" to the studio costing under 350€/month. In reality I would fill the studio with miners and would live with my friend as a "dark" under-tenant. Official papers would just point that I live in different location (at the studio my rigs are located).
I calculated that I would need to use 10 kw of energy every hour to make it worth more than the rent. 
That would be either 7 DragonMint 16Ts
14 Ethereum rigs with 6x amd rx570s
or 12 Antminer L3+s
Only thing Im wondering is do you think my neighbors could stand the 80dB-81dB noise 24/7 the rigs would make?

Or then you buy saint kitts &amp; newis's citizenship for $350k and give up your other citizenship. 
This is what Riger Ver did to avoid IRS. After getting Saint Kitts &amp; Nevis citizenship he moved to Japan.

$100k coins would easily make Satoshi world's richest person. This is if we assume s/he is one person instead of a group, still alive and hodls about 1.2M coins. 
Satoshi's bitcoins would be worth about 120B. Also if we consider all the recent shitcoin forks (Bcash, Bytether, Bitcoin Clashic, Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Diamond, UnitedBitcoin, Bitcoin Hot, Super Bitcoin, BitcoinX, Oil Bitcoin, Bitcoin World, Lightning Bitcoin, Bitcoin Stake, Bitcoin Faith, Bitcoin Top, Bitcoin God, Bitcoin FILE, Bitcoin SegWit2X X11, Bitcoin Uranium, Bitcoin Pizza, Bitcoin All, Bitcoin Cash Plus, Bitcoin Smart, Bitcoin Interest, Quantum Bitcoin, Bitcoin LITE, Bitcoin Ore, Bitcoin Private and Bitcoin ATOM) and count them in the net worth would increase by approximately 28%. In that case scenario Shatoshi's hodlings would be worth easily over $150B.

Im not scared of box catching fire that way. Im more concerned my usb riser would melt and catch fire due to poorer air flow. And if cable catches fire while having flameable material all around it that wont most likely end well.
I didn't even think about making a double box before you mentioned it. Now that I think of it I could make inner box out of wood and outer box out of some sort of material that doesn't catch fire. For example I could use steel or something similar to the outer box. Wooden box would block the noise and steel box would block the possible fire. That way I would be 100% confident leaving my rigs in a wooden box.
Is your outer box hot? I'm wondering because in that case metal for outer box would be bad idea.

Its decentralised so it cant be shut down unless there's global power outage. By that time there will be other things to worry about.
Its very unlikely that multiple major government will ban cryptos since they have already "regulated" them (little do they know decentralised things are impossible to regulate). For example Japan's government seems to be very positive about cryptos and multiple others are spending big money doing studies about them.

AMD RX470 rates:
* ETH 85 WATTS 29.0MH/S (2.93W/MH)
* XMR 85 W 750H/S (0.1133W/H)
* ZEC 85 W 270H/S (0.315W/H)
Nvidia GTX 1070 is best Nvidia card for ETH
* 135 W 27MH/S (5W/MH)
Nvidia GTX 1060 is best Nvidia card for XMR and ZEC
* XMR 110 W 420H/S (0.262W/H)
* ZEC 130 W 320H/S (0.41W/H)
As you can see AMD is far better power consumption wise as I claimed on my previous comment. 
You can't really claim that AMD or Nvidia produces more heat since there are so many different cards by different manufacturers with different cooling in the market and they all differ from each other.
I wouldn't even consider lifespan of the cards too much as long as they reach the ROI. Also since AMD cards are more efficient than Nvidia cards its acceptable if they have shorter lifetime. 
Also you need to remember that current gpus will eventually be useless for mining thanks to epoch file or newer generation gpus.

Basic attention token (BAT) tries to revolutionare online advertising. Cuts out middlemen that makes advertising not worth it. People get rewarded if they turn ads on instead of using ad blockers. Founded by creator of javascript. Aims to be functionally on their own browser (before being added to other browsers via extensions) by Q1/2018.
Ethereum (ETH) you can build decentralized apps on top of it. Huge update expected before Q1/2018.
Dubaicoin (DBIX) you can code decentralized apps on top of it in arabic. Recieving updates monthly. Dubai is aiming to move all government documents to blockchain by 2020. 
Neo (ANS) decentralized apps in china. 
Presearch decentralized search engine. Rewards people for using it. Still under development
Status (SNT) basically mobile ethereum platform/os
Other picks:
Steem: decentralised social media
Golem: decentralised super computer
Siacoin &amp; burstcoin: decentralised cloud storage
MobileGo: decentralised mobile app store
there are multiple more but Im too lazy and you probably get the idea.

[From wiki:]( 
Prior to SegWit, there was a max block size of 1MB. After SegWit, the concept of max block size was removed and replaced with max block weight. The current max block weight is 4MB.
Normally, each byte in a transaction counts as 4 bytes of block weight. However, if a byte is part of the SegWit witness area, then it receives a discount, and only counts as 1 byte of block weight.
ELI5: Block weight means how big block would have been if the txs inside it were in a legacy block instead of in SegWit form.

In theory its taxable. Jurisdictionally you can't cancel taxable event. 
But in some countries if you have fiat inside exchanges the taxable event haven't occured because the fiat haven't been transfered to your own local account. In that case you could buy back in btc and get dual citizenship to low tax country and then sell it all.

Easiest way is to participate to ERC-20 token ICO. 
That means the token is built on top of Ethereum.
You just simply send the ICO contract address your Ethereum and they send you their token. 
Since the token is Ethereum based ERC-20 token you can just hold it in the same non exchange wallet you are holding your ether.

In Finland cryptos are taxed as income instead of capital gain. Therefore if you make loss with them you can't get tax deduction.
This means if you first make 1000€ profit with crypto and then lose 2000€ you have to pay 300€ (30%) tax for your profit even though in reality you made 1000€ loss. They don't care about loss because its considered income instead of capital gain.

There are ASICS designed for SHA-256 (Bitcoin) so GPU mining is not worth it
Nvidia cards wont come even close to AMD cards in ROI. They use more electricity and have less mining power.
Edit: Rumor says that AMD RX Vega 64 and 56 will perform really well in mining (70-100mh/s on ETH).

Yes but it depends on which exchanges want to list the token.
You can check exchanges for specific tokens here:  
In general for example poloniex, bittrex, kraken and liqui have some tokens listed.

Visit the isle of man and create company that is based there. 0% corporate tax there. Then move money to that company and pay salary to yourself with 20% tax. 
There are also other legal ways to do this but Im not too familiar with them. I only know that if you would become citizen of cayman islands you would have 0% tax but citizenship costs $1.5M or something like that.
Other legal options that are good with 0% tax (idk about other costs) are: Sark, Kuwait, UAE, British Virgin Islands, Qatar, Oman, Monaco
If you want to avoid taxes illegal way you might want to consider opening a bank account to Switzerland, Luxembourg, Hongkong, Cayman, Singapore or some States in USA. Those are considered safest tax havens in the world.
Also you can just buy bitpay visa and ignore taxes that way but that's also illegal.
If you want to stay in the legal zone I recommend creating a company to area with low corporate tax (and possibly low income tax) and just pay yourself salary from that company. Or you might want to become citizen of area with low income tax and just cash out your money.

I was very interested when it was worth $8 but I considered it too risky.
I was very interested when it was worth $15 but I considered it too risky.
I was very interested when it was worth $50 but I considered it too risky.
When I finally got into ether it was around $150 and I bought in heavily when it was $200.

"What is the most tax efficient way to withdraw that money?"
He becomes dual citizen before he withdraws the money. I understood he haven't turned the crypto to fiat yet so the taxable event will occur when he does so. As long as he is holding his wealth in crypto he can't be legally taxed (expect income tax from mining profits?).
@_date: 2017-08-07 12:59:27
Its usually up to free market. 
Depending on contract (&amp; whitepaper) business can dump more tokens to the market

You are actually comparing $700+ GPU to ~$250 GPU?
1080 Ti can mine 670sol/s with 250W usage and electricity price of $0.10/kWh that equals 315 days ROI
With the price of one 1080 Ti you are able to buy ~2.5 RX480s. RX480 can get around 270sol/s so with 2.5 (I know you are not able to buy 0.5 GPUs just used for calculations) you are able to get 675sol/s which is about the same as 1080 Ti. BUT the thing is RX480 will only use 85 watts so 2.5 cards would be using only 212 watts compared to 250W of Ti. This will result in ROI of slightly under 300 days.
Also what comes to Fury it's about $600 card and it can get you about 450sol/s while using 220W. This will result in ROI of 437 days. You are able to get 540sol/s with 2 RX480s for $100 cheaper. Therefore RX 480 is better as I claimed. 
Also you need to remember that if you mine Ether instead of Zcash with your RX 480 it will result in smaller ROI of 120 days.
edit: typos

I buy into ICOs that I think have high potential. I do agree there are multiple scams and its usually impossible to tell them apart from legit ones.
I usually just dumb the tokens as soon as I have made enough profit. I only hodl the tokens if the project has very trust worthy team and I believe in the project. (BAT for example)
There are currently 2 upcoming ICOs Im interested in: Presearch (lot 2) &amp; BitDice
There are also multiple that havent annouced date yet.

There is very little regulation regarding cryptos. General recommendation is that you don't need to report your profits before you have them in your bank account. This is due to chance of exchanges getting hacked etc. and you losing your fiat.
@_date: 2017-08-07 10:06:48
Ethereum is platform. If you buy into Ether based token you buy into a project/company built on top of the platform. For example if you buy steem you are buying a social media project built on top of ether. It's kinda like if you bought facebook instead of buying internet (the platform) needed for the facebook to work.
Split depends on token. In theory yes they can split but its really unlikely because the projects have teams. So projects basically have some sort of centralisation. 
The tokens itself can have value. Just like Facebook has value. The ethereum platform itself will benefit when there are more projects built on top of the it because the platform will rise in value.

I personally think bitcoin will pass US M2 Money Supply in 15-20 years. 
US M2 Money Supply is estimated at $13.5T. Divide that by the max. 21M bitcoin and each would be about $650,000 per coin.

You have to remember US M2 Money Supply isn't even the whole US Money Supply. Also I might be a pessimist because I think bitcoin will only be worth $13.5T of world's $90+T Money.

It depends on which country's citizenship you have.
I would personally buy Saint Kitts &amp; Nevis's dual citizenship for $200k since if I wanted to cash out $1m in Finland I would need to pay $400k-$500k tax.
Edit: I would need to pay 51.8% taxes out of that $1m so $518k would be taxes if I paid taxes to Finland instead of getting dual citizenship.

Taxation in Finland currently considers profits made from cryptos as 'earned income'. Earned income tax is progressive. This means if your cash out profit amount &amp; your salary from your job exceeds 73100€ ($87230) in a single year you pay between 56.96%-61.96% tax (varies based on your municipality) out of your 'earned income'.
If profit made from cryptos were considered 'unearned income' there would be flat tax of "only" 34% if you were to sell more than 30000€ on profits ($35800) in a single year.
Edit: therefore even if bitcoin profits were considered as unearned income you would safe around $100k ish if you were to buy Saint Kitts &amp; Nevis dual citizenship for $250k compared to taxation of $340k.

Back in 2013 I had huge interest in Bitcoin but I was so young I didn't have bank account. I also had shitty laptop so I wasn't able to mine coins either.
Few years pass by and I start investing in stock market and get really interested about it.
In January 2017 my country's biggest TV news reported that "World leading cryptocurrency, bitcoin, has collapsed by 30+% from $1200-$1300 (cant remember exact price) to $900" 
That report brought the memories of the mystical cross-border internet money back to my mind. I bought some for 900s and started studying so I could learn more. Few weeks pass by and bitcoin hits like $1100. At that moment I had studied bitcoin so much I understood it would be something revolutionary and decided to invest heavily into it.
After that became the fear of security and I decided to grab Ledger Nano S to secure my keys. After I saw Ledger supports multiple currencies I realize there are other cryptos. I still consider ETH, LTC, DASH, ZEC too risky. When ETH hits $180 I feel like Im missing out of something and start studying it. Price dips to $160 and I buy some.
After hearing about BAT I understood there was potential smaller coins. I go in like 90% of my portfolio.
Since then I have invested in multiple different alts including overhyped shitcoins (due to greater fool theory). These days I consider Bitcoin the safe haven of cryptos because alts are so small market and super volatile.

Also shitcash will most likely be pumped in price to make it more appealing for miners going for short term profit. Don't support this operation by pumping shitcash by buying it. 
Thinking short term profit and buying shitcash now would be really selfish and will decrease your long term profit.
This pumping operation would currently cost $12b to be successful so "authorities" can't do it by themselves.

There's most likely nothing wrong with the movement. I just mean it's really cheap movement. This means that for example frequency of second hand isn't well as frequent as in better movements which makes it look ticky instead of sliding. Also the accuracy is not as good as in better movements. These are really important factors for watch enthusiasts but most of the "normal" people probably won't even pay that much attention to them.


They are currently making another collection called HODLER which uses exactly same movement, bracelet, clasp, second hand and case. Only the dial has changed. Oh, also the price is the same $800. They haven't put any more effort to HODLER collection and they are using the same cheap parts. 


I can see the powerful story and meaning behind the limited piece and can understand why it means so much to some. It would be super cool to have a limited piece these days that tells you were super early adopter of internet. I can imagine this piece as a status symbol in few years if bitcoin reaches the mainstream adoption (I mean it's already sort of status symbol stating the huge price growth).


Oh boy! You don't even want to know.

I know plan of becoming economically independent might sound pretty weird since I'm still under 20 and have only worked part time jobs so far but I have always thought that meaning of life is to do things that you enjoy &amp; love which certainly doesn't mean working from 9-5 for rest of my life. This means either living minimalistic way or becoming economically independent early on. I prefer the latter option.

watch enthusiastic here to drop my opinion
Second hand looks really dope with the B and the 1s and 0s telling the time on the edge of dial is really creative and nice. The white color in dial is really ugly and doesn't fit the rose gold/silver color scheme. I personally love watches that are skeleton.
Crown with B looks really dope.
Case is fucking Stainless Steel 316L with PVD Red Gold coating. 316L is great steel but Im dissapointed that Red Gold is just coating (at this price point understandable to be just a coating instead of solid gold). I love the engravings on the watch that say 'In cryptography we trust' etc.
Anti-Reflex Sapphire crystals on front and back are huge + IMO.
Bracelet looks cheap and weak but I can't really give accurate opinion if I haven't seen the bracelet in person. Butterfly clasp is my favorite clasp type so that's huge + IMO.
Cryptomatic is using miyota 8N24 movement. It costs under $50 and is really shitty movement. Accuracy is really shit ~+20secs/day. But atleast it's mechanical.
All in all pretty decent lower end watch. My taste of watches has most likely been spoiled by high end swiss luxury watches but I would never pay $400+ for watch with such a bad movement + some ugly details in overall design. Im fine if you have extra money to spend but I personally wouldn't buy such an overpriced piece.

It was back in the 2016. I can't remember the exact rate &amp; date but I think it was in the middle of May 25th - Jun 20th spike (from $450 to $760). I probably bought around $550 with huge premium (I remember I used my credit card with blockchain.info wallet which had like 7-10% premium).
I forgot about my coins until early 2017. Jan 5th one of my country's leading tv news told that "World's leading cryptocurrency bitcoin has collapsed in price". According to coinmarketcap the drop was from 1200ish to sub 900s. The piece of news didn't mention anything about the huge rally from sub 600s before the correction. 
After hearing that piece of news I invested heavily into bitcoin dumping almost all my fiat I had laying in my bank accounts (I was 17 during this time). I was "unfortunate" because price went up from sub 900s to 930s while exchange was processing my bank transfer. 
I have been into stock market since summer 2015 (I started when I was 14) and started feeling bored due to my really low return. January this year I truly started educating myself about crypto space and huge potential of it. I immediately understood the huge potential of the space.
Edit: I had been lurking around since 2012 or 2013 because I liked the idea about money of internet. Unfortunately I was still too young (12) back then to have a bank account.

What does this have to do with anything?


Bitcoin has higher volume than biggest gold futures.


Who the fuck has enough wealth to protect themselves with enough gold? Also if you had that wealth you would have better methods of protecting yourself.


Please go ahead and hack my BTC stored on my Legder Nano S


If you buy gold as an investment you will most likely buy bars because they have smallest premium. How often you wear these bars?


Bitcoin is not metal how is this argument relevant?


Bitcoin hasn't been out of fashion either. Again irrelevant argument.


Bitcoin can be received via satellite and sent via sms 


I don't understand how this argument is relevant.


So you can eat gold?


Can you prove it's in bubble? It's new technological innovation after all.


I know nothing about gold but I just read from fuckgoldisshit.org that gold is useless. It must be true because it states so in that site.

@_date: 2017-05-05 13:20:23
I wouldn't say it's pipe dream. Lets say you buy 10B͈̎ @ rate of $1,500 each. Annual return last year was 232% (adjusted for inflation) and 2015 it was 143%. Also return since beginning of this year has been 163%. Lets assume bitcoin would have annual return of 200% (doubles in price annually) for next 3 years and then the growth would slow down to 20% (some experts say 25% is realistic). Lets assume you are 27 and you are retiring at 65. This would mean you would have 10x$1,500x2^3 =$120,000 worth of bitcoin when you are 30. If we assume bitcoin would increase ~20% in price a year after that you would have 10x$1,500x1.2^10 =$743,008.37 worth of bitcoin when you are 40. Let's assume bitcoin would increase "only" 10% a year after that for next 20 years (shares increase ~8% a year). At the age of 60 you would have $4,998,585 worth of bitcoin. I didn't include inflation of fiats and decreased buying power in calculations but you get the basic idea. I'm 17 y.o. student and I'm holding only a couple of coins but if the good scenario happens I'm able to retire at around age of 45 Edit: you can also google about calculations that if 5% of capital that is invested in gold moved to bitcoin or if 1% of money in fiat moved, etc. etc.

If miners wouldn't block SegWit Bitcoin wouldn't dip and miners would make more from the block reward. Also SegWit would make it possible to fit more transactions to blocks which could increase the tax revenue. In the other hand 2. layer could be implemented but higher block reward (via price not crashing down) would outweigh the smaller taxes collected from people thanks to 2. layer and block weigh increase.

I had this plan way before I got into cryptos. Got the idea when I was like 15 and started trading stocks. My dad used this "strategy" and he managed to retire with slightly less money but he has an extra apartment he rents out. My parents also have some other passive income but I wont go to the details. My parents worked average jobs and my dad used to trade stocks so nothing special they just were very economical. My goal is to retire before my dad dies so I save up quite a lot and I try not to buy useless things. If that goal fails heritage might give a nice boost to my retirement plans. edit: I have also considered moving to other country in the Europe that is decent and has lower cost of living when it's time to retire so I would be able to retire earlier.

More I think of it,  more I start to like the idea of pure 2MB fork but I still think there should be other things included in hard fork other than just a pure blocksize increase. Hard forks are too risky to execute for the sake of a pure block size increase if SegWit alone fixes the problem for now. Add for example NIZKP or other improvement to the fork and Im interested. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 11:07:24
read the twitter I linked
@_date: 2017-07-17 10:20:16
I do know hard forks are less risky in general but SegWit has way bigger economical support compared to XT/Classic/Unlimited/EC/ABC which makes SegWit way more appealing. Another thing is SegWit adds is second layer which is needed to compete against alts with shorter block time (personal opinion). Also it seems bitcoin miners can never compromise.

here are my node's stats 
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:17:49
I do know if bitcoin goes mainstream we need to scale ALOT. But right now I think technology isn't advanced enough to support something like 4MB blocks, 8MB blocks or even 32MB blocks. 2MB is maximum technology can stand right now. If blocks were bigger than that it would require too much storage which would wipe out too many nodes. Also bigger issue would be internet connection and latecy. Latecy would increase which would increase the risk of double spending. My personal opinion is that hard fork that contains only pure block size increase is stupid because there are better options for scaling and if we take the risk of hard forking why not add other benefits on top of the block size increase that require hard fork? 
@_date: 2017-07-14 15:10:15

@_date: 2017-07-16 19:18:18
No! Price is dropping because of the uncertainty. There are still many possible outcomes to the scaling problem during next few weeks. If the miners had activated SegWit earlier users wouldn't been forced to start supporting UASF and devs wouldn't need to rush with the code to finish it before July 27th. Devs already struggled to stay in schedule which resulted with even more uncertainty. As I said had the miners activated SegWit earlier there wouldn't be uncertainty or scalability issue (for now). It would also support tps and adoption.

@_date: 2017-07-18 09:42:05
Finding perfect block size is very challenging. On the other hand you have to fit transactions into the block on the other you have to remember that bigger block size also increases latecy and latecy increases risk of double spending. Also bigger blocks take up more space so storing them to your node is another question. My personal opinion is we should try to increase block weigh as much as possibly as long as its safe instead of doing block size increases.  I also think we could increase block size from 1m to 2m because it makes little difference with the current technology but anything above that could be too risky.

Miners have made agreement to HF 3 months after activation of SegWit but there's no need for them to follow the agreement. BIP 91 alone doesn't mean hard fork later on. So yes you are playing stupid...

My parents are sceptical about whole crypto thing so I would prefer not to get them involved in this. They are not against it since it's my money and they accept it as long as it doesn't get too big weight in my portofolio (I'm from trader family and have been trading stocks since I was 14). My dad also ask me questions like "how can you be sure nobody hacks your coins from Ledger Nano while you sleep" and "how you can be sure price won't hit 0$ tomorrow". I would prefer not to use local bitcoins since traders have so high premium here.

Why should we hard fork to bigger blocks when we could just soft fork SegWit? Hard forking is way riskier that soft forking. And if SegWit activated you wouldn't even need to use the new features and you would still benefit from it. I do think we might eventually need bigger blocks but why would we risk it if we are able to solve the problem less risky way that is proven to work? Also wasn't SegWit the reason LTC increased 12x in price?
@_date: 2017-07-15 17:31:58
is it? Litecoin 12x in price after SegWit and it didnt even solve scalability issue

Hi redditor for 0 hours! Yes I do know what LN does for us.
@_date: 2017-07-16 19:55:51
My personal opinion is that technology isn't too advanced for bigger blocks than 2MB yet. If blocks were increased any bigger I feel like way too many nodes would be wiped off. Do you know how much storage 4MB or even 8MB blocks would take up each year? Average Joe wouldn't be able to run a node for long would he? Also latecy would increase which would make double spending more likely. Also running a node would need faster connection and if I remember correctly this would be an issue in some part of China which are known for mining.

@_date: 2017-07-11 18:36:07
I dont agree. There are multiple good alternatives to bitcoin. For example Litecoin is very good especially if the scaling solution won't get solved soon. I have invested heavily into alts since blocks got somewhat full in March. Before March I saw bitcoin as the only potential crypto. In March I read about ERC-20 token that I had very high interest in but since I didn't fully understand the concept yet I just bought ETH because it will benefit from such projects.  Gains (and loses) are way bigger in alts because they have smaller marketcap. I think my best day has been like +160% and worst -40%. My current strategy is to buy smaller alts that have very high potential to go mainstream or are otherwise very interesting.
@_date: 2017-07-27 18:46:14

* 1. Bitmain is signaling BIP91 (SegWit2x). Most pools will start signaling it July 21th and before that they only signal intention of signaling. If SegWit2x fails and BIP148 (UASF) happens Bitmain has said they will perform UAHF and split. 
* 2. 33% of hashing power is signaling BIP91 and 88-89% has intention of starting to signal it by July 21th. BIP141 (SegWit) has failed by this point because activation period is 2 weeks so there's no time to gather 95% of hashing power before August 1st. BIP148 has support of ~0.1% or so but if BIP91 backfires it will most likely get support. SegWit2x can also be activated via BIP148 without BIP91 if necessary. 
* 3. 2x will have chance of 2MB hard fork in 3 months. edit: SegWit2x needs support of 80%. UASF happens with 0.1% support but without 10+% support the chain will most likely never survive. There are some other details that are different but Im not going too deeply into them.

Miners aren't forced to use specific code for mining. Therefore they can just stop using SegWit2x code after the SegWit part if they want to and start running core code again. Code they use is completely up to them and they can which the code they are using whenever they want to.

I don't live in US so can't confirm but yes
@_date: 2017-07-17 18:22:38
There must be 269 out of 336 blocks signaling to lock in. After lock in there will be 336 blocks before segwit activates. This gives rest of the miners time to start running segwit software.

I mean I support 2MB blocks but incase of a hard fork there should be also something else that is useful implemented by the hard fork. Hard forks are just too risky in general and that's the reason we should avoid them if we can soft fork instead. That's the reason why I support SegWit and 2nd layer over anything. Easiest way to solve simple problem.

I meant when SegWit locks in we are sure that we will get SegWit after another 336 blocks. Also I totally forgot about the orphaned by the 2x miners part.

Well my biggest alt hodlings currently are Dubaicoin and BAT. I have invested in both because I believe in them long term so I don't really care if price goes up or down 30% every now and then. Grabbed my Dubaicoins around $2 each so Im up about 1200%. BAT price movements doesn't matter too much because I will keep buying as long as its under a dollar and I don't expect anything big before late Q3 or early Q4.

forgot segwit needs to lock in before activating check the edited dates

Bought more today and yesterday but do I care? No! I will keep buying at lower price!

that is BIP 91... from the BIP 91 code:
    // Deployment of SEGSIGNAL
    consensus.vDeployments[Consensus::DEPLOYMENT_SEGSIGNAL].bit = 4;

Let's face it in a long run we need more scaling than just SegWit. The 2 MB fork code can still evolve before the fork. If you think of it 2 MB blocks aren't that bad idea after all. I just don't see why we should hard fork only for pure block size increase. IMO there should be other benefits included in case we are risking it by hard fork for example NIZKP would be nice. I think 2 MB blocks with SegWit is actually quite good idea (and NIZKP on top of that would be perfect) because in the long run we will need scalability. Upgrade from 1 MB to 2 MB wont most likely eliminate too many nodes and it wont increase latecy of the network too much which would increase risk of double spends.

My plan would be don't buy cryptos with all the money so it wont be too suspicious. Bitcoin is not anonymous enough IMO. There is too high risk of getting caught (not likely but still). You should buy more anonymous altcoin like zcash or monero. Then incase you want to swap to bitcoin create new exchange account (using vpn) to exchange that doesn't require ID and fill forms with fake info. After that if you want to cash out large amount of cryptos without getting caught and without having to pay income tax do it via cash trades.

Second layer is required or we aren't able to compete with alts with shorter block times. Also economical majority supports SegWit over big blocks. There are also some other disadvantages big blocks have including increased latecy which increases the risk of double spends.

well f2pool or gbminers + something else then

I visited China (Shenzhen) last October. There were actually some brown people. One that I met taught English in one of the best schools nearby and was from USA. He spoke fluent English and Chinese. Other taught physics in the best boarding school nearby. There were also some others but I cant remember much about them.
