Call center work is what you get around here too, that is how I paid for the career, I have 7 years nightshift customer service experience, It is the long calls that have a similar component, Psychology and Customer service online compliment eachother, Ive had all types of caller too, specially on the sportsbook ones, amazon was nicer but there was much more work to do.

I am a Psychologist, I have to explain things to people sometimes, I dont do it for fun anymore, I have found that if people is not paying for your opinion they will never ever change their mind based on shit you say, it is 100% pointless to try and change anybody's mind on any topic, unless they have somehow surrendered the steering wheel of their thoughts to you voluntarily in advance.

I think segwit is the one dog being wagged by the tail not BU, BU wants what is best, on chain scaling, while segwith wants to achieve development control over the whole currency, if they are the only ones allowed to make any progress they will be able to change it to their advantage anytime in the future, they are people and will be (may already be) compromised. Let the market choose the one that truly decentralizes better, we will only know by testing both live with the world, this is virgin ground, your outdated models wont fit, it was not trough risk avoidance that bitcoin has come to exist, let the fork happen and may the best coin win.

I think the EU is getting more and more control of the countries and globalizing as fast as it can, from its beginnings it was sold as a simple trade treaty for the European Coal and Steel Community, it was designed to be s slippery slope into  economic and regulatory unity and loss of Sovereignty and it has achieved that on every step almost without friction. 
It is easier to buy and influence the whole block if you only have one group of people making decisions, as opposed to various parliaments comprised of hundreds of individuals, it is also cheaper.
Because of this there is net advantage of being autonomous, you know that the leaders are a bit less likely to be manipulated, even if it is just a bit, it makes a difference for the better of the local people. 
The disadvantage of the Brexit is only on the short term, and is the revenge of the powers who lost, they are blasting on the media they own, manipulating the markets as much as they can, trying to scare people into supporting their interest (to have power centered in Brussels where is more easily manipulated for less money), I predict this effort will ultimately fail, when France and others exit and the British are hailed as the first to take independence, they will feel proud of the decision and a statue will be erected to honor Boris Johnson.
I do feel qualified to make these statements based on my study of the origins of the European union and my lifelong knowledge of world affairs in general, though I admit politics is more of a general interest of mine, not my profession.

I see what you mean, I would be able to appreciate more If I thought she deserved it, you could argue she is supposed to be an expert, she never claims to have the technical chops.
I think she was under the impression that this was one of those low tec, much hype, "how can I bitcoin?" intro episode of random podcast.
She lost credibility big time because she did not have the technicals ready and that is all the guys cared about, she will recover and yes her being attractive will help tons, the Streisand effect trigger was a mistake on her part, I bet every lawyer on earth knows better but goes along with the outrage anyway haha

Brexit is what happens when the good people who opose corporate interest are influential enough to make the fools vote in a way that benefits them, then said fools might be scared by the corporate owned media into regretting the decision since they never understood in the first place, ultimate good in the long run to have a local government instead a remote un-elected ruller on Brussels  making the rules for them

They are getting the leave itch again because of the vote, yes, but once they see all the other countries leaving and praising Britain for being the first, they will be content being out of the EU, also the momentum of the leave petition will make it succeed this time, so at the end Scotland will be out of both, according to my predictions
@_date: 2016-06-28 06:45:45
They will be able to influence more the rules that affect them locally, as opposed to the way it is with other countries where they have to take decisions made in Brussels more seriously, that is until they exit as well 
@_date: 2017-01-11 08:56:07
It Used to be that you could not send money over the internet because it was easy to commit fraud, this is why we used to need western union, visa, paypal and banks to process transactions, now with bitcoin you can send money online anywhere in the world without risk of fraud or a middle man who gets a cut, It works by using all the people who download the bitcoin program to confirm there is no possibility of fraud automatically, this program has been downloaded on many many computers already so at this point is safer than any other method ever.

The best of them all is  only with them you get a true understanding of the "Natural-ponzy" effect, why every other altcoin is shaitzen so far and why bitcoin is our only hope, please power through the horrible and disrespectful treatment of the guests, and you will realize that there is a reason for it, the people who just jump on the hype of a ponzy with little or none technical knowlege are causing a great evil to other dumb people, these people are respected if they admit ignorance and the facts and should not be dealt with too much patience if they dont want to understand why they must stop pumping lies even if they used to do it with good intention, the more episodes you can tolerate going back to the better.

Circle is credible, they have great customer service and your transaction will go through eventually, make sure you are on one of the allowed countries and certify your account with your ID and selfie, this is necessary for them to send anything over $30 most of the times

Very welcome, you can check the state of the network here   when Mempool size goes over 1.00 it is going to be a bit slower, if it goes over 10 it will be over a day for low fee

Its good to get people exited about fiver and all, but they have accepted bitcoin for a couple of years now it feels

Electrum is good and has a nice Icon but I prefer Mycelium for android and copay for IOS they simplify this whole fee business a bit more, user friendlyand have many useful features, also if you will store more than one bitcoin order a hardware wallet for use with mycelium, to stay on topic, I recommend doing a normal fee if the network is normal, but high fee if the transaction is over $20 or if the network is too busy ,"dynamic fees" on electrum tends to backfire like that when the transactions are too many, this has happened 5 times this year, today was worse than ever at some point around 4am ET. you can check the state of the network here: 
@_date: 2016-11-24 21:28:27
Very welcome! xD, Just like quantum physics explains better the universe than Newtonian classic, but we still use Newtonian to explain daily situations because it is practical, taking about you sending a high fee when the network is busy and when sending over $20 is just a matter of convenience for understanding, the very technical explanation will help more when you are trying to develop for bitcoin not for the use of applications that already exist
@_date: 2016-12-09 05:29:06
@_date: 2016-11-24 11:08:17
This is normal for today, check the "mem pool" size is 50MB when normally is just 1MB

I hear them all, just to make sure I dont miss anything, best is always bitcoin uncensored, the most educational, less boring (no pun intended) and the only one who calls out the alt coins and people who only pretend to know a lot, but are actually just buzzword echoes. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 21:54:43
Hands down gemini.com if you have debit card, paxful.com if you have prepaids or paypal,  to store the bitcoin below $100 you can use Mycelium on android, copay on iphone, for amounts over $100 must use a trezor for best results. 
@_date: 2017-01-26 06:09:50
please tell me about your experience with xapo once you have tried them, I can confirm gemini.com is very similar and the best alternative to circle for now
@_date: 2016-11-25 12:51:39
Scam 
@_date: 2016-12-26 11:17:48
The best time to withdraw then, would be when the price is lower or equal to the time you deposited, this way you get more bitcoin for your USD, if the price increases after that point you would have more USD, and if it happens to decrease your losses are temporary until it starts increasing again.  I think you would benefit of calculating how much is your waking time worth, this way you can track the value of your USD when there is work and wait time involved 
@_date: 2016-11-02 11:19:47
have you looked into wirex? the user youtube trials for euros appear to be doing fine with it, I understand it can be used in GBP too
@_date: 2016-12-26 11:03:06
I Understand what you mean, you are worried that If the price is increasing and you deposit an specific bitcoin amount that represents the USD you want to have, you will have more USD to deposit the longer you wait to make the deposit, and if the price keeps increasing you loose USD the longer you wait.

They are not going to do this, cause it will take people to bitcoin faster, globalist are scrambling to implement cashless as fast as possible now, time is of the essence, what they will do is put up a "surveillance wall"  instead of a real physical wall that would be much easier to skip, automatic police drone cars, dog drones, and good old flying drones patrolling automatically the border with literal iron fists, and sensors capable of detecting ants 100km away.

Better keep out of the exchange all together, they close your account for the minimum indication of sportsbook patterns 
@_date: 2016-11-24 10:54:15
I have an Idea, start a pool that takes low fee transactions, if you pay me, that way I still make profit and if you added a low fee by mistake it can be corrected.

@_date: 2016-12-26 10:55:31
Then the price fluctuations of bitcoin should not be a concern, they will convert the bitcoin you send to USD when you deposit, and back into bitcoin when you request a payout, once the bitcoin are in your hands you can start worrying about converting those into Nubits with a value pegged to the USD  or convert to USD using one exchage, a third alternative is to just keep the bitcoin on your wallet.

Everybody knows this, just make a quick reddit or google search, known offenders are coinbase and circle, easy to prevent just by using a personal wallet between the exchange and the sportsbook, multiple addresses is another option 
@_date: 2016-11-10 07:33:22
Hahaha dont be too hard on yourself, this is a misconception they dont discourage on coinbase and circle, might even be intentional, stick around and browse the archive of r/btc and r/bitcoin, listening to every bitcoin podcast out there helps too

Circle, coinbase, and gemini.com have been known to block users accounts because they have detected funds from betting, you can avoid this using a personal wallet like mycelium for android or copay for IOS, between the exchanges and the vendors

I think a better approach would be to somehow track every pixel and its color and account for any changes every fraction of a second, then you could encrypt and add this data into a bitcoin transaction, an specialized block explorer could put the original video together, I think.
@_date: 2016-10-09 06:40:46

Hopefully education will also be decentralized? then the people would be smart :)

doesnt even demand that you create an account, though you can if you want
@_date: 2016-07-20 05:11:41
Do they ask for kyc forms and ID and UB before you can buy bitcoin? I have always wondered
never used them
@_date: 2017-07-10 04:02:55
I love your reaction more ♥
@_date: 2016-07-24 14:41:36
Bitcoin scams hurt us all, lets report the hell out of them, or create a rating system for coins much like coinmarketcap, but more decentralized 
@_date: 2016-07-02 07:52:03
Coinmarketcap.com is very legit, dont have any other favorites for now, lots of likes, some affairs but I wouldnt marry 
@_date: 2016-07-07 09:16:16
coindesk app

nice try FBI

Bitcoin will grow regardless, none of them affect that much
@_date: 2018-12-10 16:10:20
Booo Booooooooooooooooo
@_date: 2016-07-04 08:08:01
I jump from obsession to obsession, Been doing it ever since I can remember, those last 3-4 years on average, Im on the 3rd bitcoin year, wonder what will get me out of it... hope is something profitable

I'll make it a drinking game
One reference to any crypto currency = one drink

I guess selling your soul to the devil DOES in fact work, those religious propaganda releases about pokemon all made it look like it was a bad thing
@_date: 2016-07-11 04:29:18
good to know
@_date: 2016-07-21 12:50:48
I have done this with  JW and Mormons,  I can keep a straight face for like 15 min xD
@_date: 2016-07-16 16:26:33
I think Satoshi did it for shits and giggles, but yes we have the power and the responsibility now to use it for good, we must use visa bitcoin for now but the change is inevitable, they are just trying to delay, banking will be decentralized.

Beautiful website
@_date: 2016-07-20 09:39:26
It may be because you are calling circle.com "bitcoin", as if they represent "bitcoin" nobody likes that, I would ban you from my site for a while too for that
@_date: 2016-07-13 17:19:39
Ive heard cex.io is good for the USA, hundreds of customers at my job use circle.com but those 2 require ID, you may be able to buy at paxful.com without ID 
@_date: 2016-07-15 04:17:01
This blows my mind
@_date: 2016-07-12 12:55:43
@_date: 2016-07-01 09:17:35
Thanks for your wisdom
@_date: 2017-07-27 14:44:29
Check other subreddits to cross reference always
@_date: 2018-12-13 13:46:20
get a phone and use it only for bitcoin wallets, memorize a and/or save the cellphone wallets mnemonic word passwords 
@_date: 2016-07-09 08:45:45
You could also prove it by sending another small payment to the same address from the "-250" address
@_date: 2016-07-07 09:10:46
Thanks for the heads up

Mining equipment has been improving over the years faster every time, but we have hit a limit and the next update may take 1-2 years, this opens a small window of time when you can have the most updated equipment and get a return on your investment before it becomes obsolete

You go meet him in person
@_date: 2016-07-25 06:17:58
They are reputable, try calling customer service, let us know how it goes if you dont mind :)
@_date: 2017-06-10 20:56:06
Love you man. But your comment is disrupting the accepted bank funded narrative so it will be attacked 
@_date: 2016-07-10 04:52:46
@_date: 2016-07-16 18:17:05
Dude, sounds like you dont know about I am a fan they had the DOTA2 Manila Major 2016  but it appears that is over 
@_date: 2016-07-06 08:21:24
It happened to me, they woulnd't let me withdraw any bitcoin directly, they had no problem converting to Nubits then sending them to me. 
Please try that, later you can take your nubits and convert to btc somewhere else
@_date: 2016-07-01 07:49:29
They will be fine, maybe more than fine
@_date: 2016-07-30 08:42:22
You got some reading to do about the bitcoin network :), yes once the sync is over it will show 
@_date: 2016-07-10 05:15:39
History rhymes
@_date: 2016-07-16 09:13:53
I am able to confirm they do this at circle.com as well, if they find out they close
