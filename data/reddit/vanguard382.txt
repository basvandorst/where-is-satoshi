I'm struggling to fully understand private and public key and was hoping someone could help make it clear. So you have your public blockchain key or address and want to send bitcoins to a friends publix address. Does each bitcoin have it's own private key or does your wallet public key have a private key to go along. If it does how does one find it out in the first place?

Alright I think I'm beginning to understand. The only other thing that troubled me was if I create a new blockchain account I get the public key (address) but I never see anything about a private key. Is this blockchain doing something on there end to make it easy on users or did I miss something. My main concern is that I'm not properly backing up my bitcoins, I've used there backup feature and get that wallet data in a safe location bit should I be getting another private key as well? Thanks for all the fantastic responses as well it's greatly appreciated. Information is power!

First impressions: Very nice interface, clean and easy to use. Badge is a great feature as well. Would love to see support for some alts and ability to select which one you showed via the badge.
I see a bright future for this app!

Gotta jump through some hoops but  create an account, deposit USD with paypal, purchase SLL with USD, then purchase BTC with SLL. Your going to get loads of fees from converting making this option extremely expensive but it is quick and dirty. 
Hope this helps.
