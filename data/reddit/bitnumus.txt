Thats complete rubbish, talk about reinventing the wheel. Also how this even be called a price index when it includes only a few exchanges.

Its NOT a UK exchange if it doesn't support faster payments/domestic transfers. Would you cal Bitstamp a UK exchange because its a UK LTD company?

As much as I am an advocate this is just stupid
@_date: 2014-04-30 15:17:26
Yet they only use one exchange for USD data? And one that refuses to supply volume data to  ?
@_date: 2014-04-15 17:33:08
How is this different to other apps already out there like bitpays own?
@_date: 2014-01-04 11:38:27
I don't think it is anymore, more and more are using a weighed average of exchanges around the world. Just recently kitco.com added a ticker and used  's source for it.
Point being that yes a lot of code already out there like tickers on sites probably will need changing, but I think new tickers and sites will see that mtgox is not the go to price anymore
As for the bitcoinity comment this is totally different as they are just charting a bunch of exchanges and as far as I know they list them based on volume
@_date: 2014-08-25 08:11:51

We need this. Being able to receive an invoice to pay by someone in the US via coinbase who doesn't wish to hold BTC works so well. 
Paying someone here in the UK using Bitcoin who doesn't yet wish to handle, hold or try to convert it is very difficult

Yes they risk their freedom and as such you admit they could lose that freedom at any point. 
I don't then think it's fair to say they are better to purchase from than an exchange conforming with aml/kyc. The title does not ask about anonymity and most would rather have less risk for this luxury

@_date: 2014-03-27 14:49:49
Its not about being compliant with UK law, there have been plenty of outfits who have. Banks are not taking on clients who operate this type of business as its considered high risk, and previous exchanges haven't been totally honest with their bank. Let's hope they are different but I'd like to know why a bank would favour these over all the previous exchanges. There aren't that many banks that it could be so there may be a case for discrimination against previous businesses!

@_date: 2014-02-22 18:31:19
It doesn't matter how you operate, who you explain your business model to, or if you're operating well within current regulations, if head office says no unfortunately you don't have a leg to stand on.
The problem is there are only a handful of banks in the uk, if they want to remove clients who have anything to do with bitcoin they can and are well within their rights to do so 😞
Note: sorry for being so negative but that's just how it are right now, hopefully this will change in time ☺

Https://bitcoinaverage.com shows global daily volume for exchanges that are integrated. Until a smart way to mix exchanges with and without fees is conjured up, using Chinese exchanges is a little misleading imho

Don't use just 1 exchange (I don't think coinbase is even classed as an exchange?), you should get your rate from BitcoinAverage.com
@_date: 2014-05-08 14:20:54
If they wanted to go down the route of using coinbase, i don't know if bitpay offer this also.
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:10:01
Coinbase is just an online wallet, your coins aren't stuck there you can send them to any other address you wish.
@_date: 2014-01-19 17:10:22

This is due to a few exchanges about to start trading it and people buying so they can do exactly that, also probably betting the price will go higher on one of those exchanges. It has nothing to do with much else imho, nothing new is going on in ltc

When you pay on your card it doesn't take 10seconds to settle with the merchant.
There are methods that are being used by for example BitPay, that don't require any confirmations but are based on network propagation, take a look at this link:

I've used them since their conception, generally they have done a great job. However, I feel them becoming slightly distant recently with the influx of new users. 
They could do more, but then again so can everybody, at least they make announcements on the most important topics.
My one wish is that they improve their trading engine soon, they have done a decent job on regulation as much as people get annoyed with KYC its needed, but their software is suffering with all the time spent on this. 
Overall I'm happy and will continue trading

Hi, take a look at  it averages out exchanges from around the world.
It doesn't currently include mtgox in its calculations because they are not allowing bitcoin withdrawals, and fiat withdrawals are also limited. This is the only exchange where the price has ventured this low for the reasons outlined above.
I can't advise on whether they will enabled withdrawals again or not, but only invest what you can afford to lose, obviously depositing to mtgox right now would be higher risk
@_date: 2014-01-06 17:25:50

They need to be open about passing through to bitstamp. Bitstamp no longer has the liquidity to handle this like it used to, so they need to handle their leveraging in house.

@_date: 2012-11-29 15:28:16
More profitable than mining bitcoins with a GPU. Though mostly everyone mining litecoin just sells them for bitcoin, there are very few uses for them, places to spend them etc.
Litecoin is just a joke anyway, as far as I'm aware it was originally setup to be mined only with CPU and already people have been using GPUs for months

Your wallet file is your private keys what do you mean exactly?
@_date: 2012-12-02 10:58:10
This is why it didn't work for you, you can also find out what random port its running on using netstat but that's just a pain
You could also run tor/vidalia independently if you don't need the browser etc
@_date: 2012-11-29 15:25:31
They make it quite clear that you may have to go through AML procedures. Its getting annoying with the amount of people claiming mtgox are 'stealing' their bitcoin. Don't use a company that has to be regulated if you want to protect your privacy!
@_date: 2012-12-10 16:02:40
No, this isn't what I'm referring to, there is a snapshot of the block chain on the official hit for 170k blocks, you replace these files and run it from therethere
@_date: 2012-12-21 07:33:26
As far as I'm aware their system is open source so feel free to review it yourself or get someone here who is familiar to explain
@_date: 2012-11-30 08:52:40
The point still remains the same, why would the OP send bitcoin with no intention of trading them on the exchange? I am not well versed in AML procedures but you sound like the expert!

Bloody brilliant hahaha
@_date: 2012-11-29 15:23:10
Yea just a joke, I wrote the editor an email noting my disgust!
@_date: 2012-12-09 22:02:47
On this point you can download a snapshot of the block chain via torrent, and its on the official github I think? Like 170,000 blocks last time I used it.
Not sure why this isn't mentioned more as we know now its the database system that's bottlenecks and not the downloading.
@_date: 2012-12-03 23:09:09
So much negative press towards an exchange that everyone bases their value of bitcoin on, due to lack of user security. That's not my idea of good/helpful news. Maybe it should help people realise they need to take proper precautions but all it does is turn people away because if their fears of being 'hacked on mtgox'
@_date: 2012-11-10 17:00:10
This is true, its also why you must encrypt it before any data is written.
@_date: 2012-11-21 07:49:09
Its fully public that mtgox have to comply with AML regs, it is also known that connecting through TOR will flag your account for this.
Next time read the FAQ of the site you are sending money to before you point fingers, I feel you are to blame for your loss.
@_date: 2012-11-30 19:30:34
I can sell you half a bitcoin for UK bank transfer!

There is no problem selling BTC for GBP on mtgox, or withdrawing it, it just gets sent as international transfer.

@_date: 2012-11-25 14:23:45
Who cares about BFL? They have to match bASIC specs to not look inferior, they have already doubled their units hashing power because Tom did. This time the reason is because of board layout etc and they need feel the need to match it. Josh is an idiot and reason enough for me to buy nothing from them.
@_date: 2012-12-18 13:00:39
Title misleading, there is a minimum fee of £15.
I can do a far better rate than this :)

@_date: 2012-12-03 18:47:09
I don't think this is very common, if someone gets hold of your wallet.dat of which doesn't have an encryption password then thats all that needs to happen. If your wallet is encrypted with a decent strength password its near impossible to crack it, in this case you would need some kind of key logger installed on your computer by the attacker to steal your passphrse

@_date: 2012-12-02 15:59:27
I have withdrawn via international wire quite a few times which is the same process, takes 2-3 weeks and costs £25.
They need to sort their UK banking issues! I think for you it's cheaper to do a SEPA, also takes less time about 3 days.
If you want to buy only a few bitcoin I am in UK and can prob help you out
@_date: 2012-11-18 11:39:23
This guy should have his picture in wikipedia under 'moron'
@_date: 2012-11-08 08:49:51
For me almost all the exchanges with UK bank accounts have let me down. Wire transfers are just too expensive and take too long, so I would advise an over the counter trade. There are plenty of people here in the UK who will trade for a bank transfer.
I have recently set up a UK based forum especially for helping people meet for this purpose, make a thread and see how it goes, I for one can sell you a handful :)
@_date: 2012-12-02 10:50:25
When such issues occur turn to a local! I can normally do a few bitcoin for same fee as blockchain via a bank transfer or pingit :)

Find somebody local that has some to sell to you, mtgox isnt the only way to buy bitcoin
@_date: 2015-04-13 16:29:42
There have been bitcoin exchanges/companies that have become FCA regulated prior, even when as you say there was no need, it was not required by the FCA. The same goes for MSBs. As a bitcoin exchange in the UK both of the above would be the most that could be done to be considered "regulated"
Knowing the above, what the hell is your article/headline even attempting to say? Coinbase have come up with their own regulations? There is a special bitcoin regulation that nobody else is aware of?
@_date: 2015-04-02 07:18:29

@_date: 2015-04-29 09:35:12
o look nothing to do with UK banking or regulation. This is NOTHING new.
@_date: 2015-04-29 09:54:30
Its no different that using bitstamp or any other exchange that accept SEPA, other than that they have a GBP book.
This sort if thing is nice to hear (expansion), but until the UK has an exchange that utilises the FPS, nobody is going to get excited....
@_date: 2015-04-23 07:01:22
He is probably talking about future
@_date: 2015-04-17 15:18:25
@_date: 2015-04-12 07:02:11
Then you have no idea what you are reporting. There have been many "regulated" exchanges but this all means nothing at all in the UK because the banks just aren't interested. This forces the "regulated" exchanges abroad, like Coinfloor
@_date: 2015-04-29 09:55:52
No because you get hit by FX rates twice, the SEPA transfers in EUR. Its cheaper to do a standard wire generally.
@_date: 2015-04-12 07:00:22

The OP is thinking it will take this long to sync. You do realise it doesn't take this long right?
@_date: 2015-04-30 14:14:45
I don't debate often so when I read this blog post this conversation was the first thing that came to mind. There is no banking partner or new regulation here which is the point I was trying to make.
As for the FCA registrations as pointed out its not needed but some still went down the route in hope it would aid them in getting a banking partner. One example of this is coinpay.co.uk that since went bust for the exact same reason as every other UK exchange

Not sure what you are finding difficult, if you have a hotwallet on your phone just scan the QR code and its done. 
If not I believe the invoice page likely uses a bitcoin uri, so you should just be able to click it and it will load your default os wallet if you have one. 
Failing that use your web wallet and fill the data manually, either way I don't see what your problem is?

Take a look at  for volumes.
There aren't any that utilise the FPS, apart from the latest startup lazycoins. Personally i wouldn't want to be the guinea pig here.
Most "exchanges" in the UK are p2p based, like bittylicious, localbitcoins and bitbargain. Coinfloor are doing a decent job, they don't have UK banking but i believe have free SEPA deposits to their bank in poland? You'd need to check that

@_date: 2015-03-30 14:19:17
Getting licensed as a MSB means nothing, even being fully FCA regulated means nothing.
The only real value is a banking relationship which they do claim, however refuse to disclose (kind of pointless seeing as only the sort code is needed to find out the bank).
There have been other UK exchange startups that have failed because their "banking relationship" was fake, in that the bank didn't actually know they were operating a bitcon exchange, only time will tell here.
@_date: 2015-02-05 12:04:31

They don't, magicaltux and others have told me directly that this is against MLR. Deposits must come from a bank account bearing the account holders name.
Your comment about knowing business, well I have no idea what that was supposed to mean. Did you read their TOS yet?

Get real, mark didn't lie on his paperwork, he filled that out in 2011 for Christ sake. They publish some guidance which isn't even law, and 2 weeks later slam a non-US business with breaching it. As you point out there are plenty of businesses in the US probably in breach of this new 'guidance' yet nothing has been done.
You are also naive to think just because they got a few million in backing that they are more competent, mtgox do not need investment they already have millions.

This is false, on the satoshi client it generates a pool of 100 keys per time. So you are good for 100 transactions if you use a new address each time.

Imo this is rubbish, this is just saying a bitcoin exchange doesn't fall under them as a supervisory body for MSB.

Based on the first weeks dividends (which obviously is a lot higher than probably future earnings, was about 20coins for 1000 shares, since down to 6coins) you would need to spend 35btc to make 1btc per week at share price of 0.7btc. So I have no idea why people are paying that or some even over 1btc for a share! Just stupid.
I would say around the 0.4 mark maybe .5
@_date: 2013-06-09 17:46:02
I'm sorry but you say there are some 'big' issues, your example is 'huge technical weakness' yet you don't want to discuss them and just say it's down 35%.... What did you even post this thread for

@_date: 2013-02-21 07:14:30
Exactly right, the developers controlling the supply is just stupid. If you want to buy 100,000 XRP for 1BTC the developers have just created 30million USD as of now. I played with the system for a few days and really do not see the point of it.
@_date: 2013-01-28 07:10:52
I have never used any of the methods mentioned so far. Just store your wallet in an encrypted container using something like truecrypt, and store this on a few different flash drives or storage of your choice. Maybe in a few different locations 
You should also take regulars backups, at least every 100 transactions (if you use a new address for each incoming)

Is the point not that you still have more USD value in the coins you have left? Sure it must be killer to loose half of your coins, but the price increased 6x. If everyone has this mentality nobody will spend/use them and I'll continue to repeat this

What exactly is contradicting here? You are comparing apples and oranges. International wire != SEPA transfer, they are coming from totally different banks.
The problem with their Japanese bank is the number of daily transactions and the issue with the polish bank is weekly volume.

@_date: 2013-03-31 10:34:31
Be warned this goes against money laundering regulations, and bitstamp will likely been punished for it in the future.
There is a reason you CANNOT use something like TransferWise to send to mtgox. That is because it doesn't get sent with your name, from your bank account.
For those who don't care about MLR that's fine, its your choice. But don't be shocked if bitstamp become regulated and have to freeze accounts until AML documentation is provided. Again just like mtgox do if you try this there.

An alternative 
I know this includes mtgox but I don't think it right to totally exclude them just yet. Yes they have issues and many people arent getting fiat out, but yesterday I received a decent size international withdrawal  that I initiated on the 6th of Aug so hopefully things with their bank are getting better

@_date: 2013-02-12 07:36:33
Im still against your point, maybe we have it right here in the UK with the transaction I was referring to. Its faster than using a credit card and no bank needs to be linked.
You can send GBP via a mobile app called pingit direct to a mobile phone number, 0 fees and instant. We have a small marketplace where plenty of people buy btc I think because of how fast it is.
What does linking to a bank account and using an exchange have to do with it, start trading with real people and you will notice the benefits
@_date: 2013-12-31 14:43:00
Sometimes larger transactions take a while if their hot wallet is low. Sometimes they have issues broadcasting transactions, there is an API that lists these that can be found in their wiki, sorry I don't have the link handy but you can broadcast it yourself using the RAW transaction if you find it
@_date: 2013-01-18 23:12:52
I recommend using bitbargain instead, most days you can get better than blockchains rates, some days even spot, and you are dealing direct with UK residents/sellers, like me :-) 
Or course you can sell here yourself also
Try it out :-) 
@_date: 2013-05-01 18:21:53
I don't see why everyone thinks the price rises on a daily basis, I think the mania is over and we can finally see some stability maybe in a few weeks
@_date: 2013-01-28 06:55:41
You are buying from other people not from an 'exchange' so if the sellers have a lot of coin prices will be lower. I have sold for spot there a few times and there are other sellers who do this more regularly.
The speed is a huge factor for some people, I have sold coins in 1minute start to finish.
@_date: 2013-06-05 12:47:09
Exactly why I dislike it, there wasn't a level playing field from the start with the developer and others GPU mining 1000s of coins while schmucks were mining away on CPUs
@_date: 2013-01-29 14:35:34
Being a great contributor doesnt make you King fucking Kong.
@_date: 2013-10-04 11:43:55
Or  :)
EDIT: (due to comments) there is a separate API for this temporarily. Take a look at the API docs
@_date: 2013-05-14 21:19:17
you have to store it there to buy and sell, there are many traders who use mtgox far too much for this to be an option
@_date: 2013-06-20 17:22:08
Then use something else, and don't complain if there isn't an alternative as you clearly don't realise how difficult it is to get a regulated exchange up and running
@_date: 2013-09-23 11:44:14
The answer, unfortunately, is no

Please do some more research, there are plenty of 'dormant' function already coded by satoshi that can be used by anyone who wants to code their own client or by the developers of the satoshi client.

I also have been paying for my online services for over a year, and have made many other purchase with btc. So I cannot agree with people that suggest nobody spends them
It really has to do with what people think they are worth to them. I was happy spending at $5 just the same as now.

Not totally sure what you are trying to do, or why you went this route if you are trying to buy bitcoin in the uk.

That's bull, they are not worth 90coins because BTC was 'cheaper back then' it works the other way. They are greedy
@_date: 2013-04-10 07:05:50
Companies like bitpay already do this, if there are 1000s of people who want to spend bitcoin, its extra revenue for the merchant, hence why tons of smaller merchants are picking this up.
By the way, fees are cheaper than credit cards for merchants.
Fiat fantasies

Yes. This is one unit and people won't be getting them for a long time yet.
Why is everyone missing the fact they should have been delivered in October, its a little late to be giving these people even a slice of praise, they are a bunch of conmen.

Yes or   :)
@_date: 2013-06-23 09:04:00
Calm down.
The reason for the issue is the UK banking system, you cannot just start a business in the money transfer sector here and expect it to be plain sailing. Trust me it's not and current I'm unable to trade due to lack of s bank account. 
If you think you can find a cooperating bank please do contact me.
@_date: 2013-07-17 06:45:27
Do they process USD withdrawals then? (Btce). They are always cheaper there becauae its next to impossible to fund with fiat
@_date: 2013-07-06 09:14:15
Deeply inside the community posting from a throwaway. If you think you and your opinions are so important why hide behind a fake alias
@_date: 2013-05-14 21:22:58
yup, once people realise they aren't panic selling BTC but actually panic selling USD, the price will rally :)
@_date: 2013-02-05 17:00:56
The USP should be a cheaper price :)
@_date: 2013-09-26 17:16:08
Its  as far as I'm aware. Also I've spoke to them in the past and also the cooperative bank and have a formal response stating they wouldn't deal with 'a business of this nature'. So seems they got special treatment :)

Omg is this what's been stopping me compiling on ARM for the last week? When I copy chain it always requests reindexing or says the chain is invalid. I've literally tried everything and didn't expect it to be a bug, can anyone clarify?

It's not good enough people have to post on reddit before you take any notice. Check your inbox or hire someone to do it for you
@_date: 2013-04-09 06:40:18
As we've seen these kinda of companies just do not 'get it'. Amazon already have their own coin and its not crypto. 
Bitcoin will dominate this space for years to come. I have faith in the developers, Gavin is an outstanding guy and any issue the OP has pointed out can be worked on with concensus from the foundation.
It has taken us years for people to understand and embrace this ideology, don't be so sure a popup crypto by some large corporation will take its place. There mere fact the OP states this shows he doesn't understand the TRUE driving force behind bitcoin, its not these newcomers or investors that have jumped in the past 2 or 3 months.

I see what you did there.
@_date: 2013-05-22 07:21:20
Along with asicminer shares. The prices people are trading these at are just stupid, someone didn't do the math
@_date: 2013-11-29 09:25:50
Yes someone email these news outlets and point them to  or something similar, using only mtgox still is just madness
@_date: 2013-09-30 07:06:15
5% is correct I've used this service
@_date: 2013-02-17 22:02:37
That last sentence is an amazing fact
@_date: 2013-10-29 12:19:21
I'm reposting this on every repost.
If they do not bank in the UK, it is not a UK exchange, just like mtgox and Bitstamp are not UK exchanges
@_date: 2013-04-17 08:51:30
I'm sorry that's total rubbish!

Coingenuity I believe owns the business and has been around for years in the community. He has prior of doing this though so this should be made visible until resolved
@_date: 2013-02-25 07:29:46
Just to answer the importing question, you don't have to import the wallet.dat file directly into another client, though I thought this would be possible myself. You can dump the private keys from bitcoin-qt using the console window. Then you can import there anywhere even to mtgox for example.
@_date: 2013-07-15 16:35:20
Some great articles coming out if coindesk, keep it up!

If I could put words into the guys mouth I would say a SPV reference client of sorts would be amazing. As good as electrum is, its just not as stable or well supported as bitcoind

blockchain = cannot buy in the UK anymore.
Every single UK bank (yes all 5 of them) are blocking usage with bitcoin right now. I today had an account application declined for running a bitcoin related business.
@_date: 2013-07-03 06:48:38
@_date: 2013-02-13 06:50:28
No? Why are you assuming this? The people I sell to could be 100s of miles away, even thousands. They just need a UK bank account and there is nothing strange about trading with people in your own country.
Entering all your details etc is not as fast as ping it which is a preloaded bank account ewallet effectively

I for one would love to see a better GUI, not for me but for the people who love apples products. I know this will be at the bottom of the devs list, but it could go a long way to making it more relative to the masses
@_date: 2013-07-03 06:26:22
Why are people downvoting this, because you hold shares? It's exactly right and the comment from the OP shows why. 3years ROI from dividends, do you know how stupid that is in bitcoin? If you aren't able to sell your shares for a decent amount you will loose.
@_date: 2013-04-03 08:40:56
Go easy, if mtgox hadn't been around as long as it has been bitcoin wouldn't be thriving today. Give credit where its due, sure they have some issues, but there is not another exchange that has been around as long and with so few major issues.
@_date: 2013-07-07 15:30:52
I agree, and that's why I'm buying. At some point this year I am confident it will be higher than the prices I just purchased at on the way down, so its all good!

Ripple is a joke, the distribution of the 'credits' hugely favours the developers to the tune of 50%.
I'll not be using it

I spend my coins all the time, just buy more back occasionally. As long as your average buy price is lower than what you spend for its all good

Not a UK exchange then

Most of your comments are related to the site being new yes.
I really don't know what you mean about the main site feed being a mess though, every entry explains what it is, who it was by and where it was posted. If you only want to see updates relating to ASICs for example you should filter it by this group. You can goto the groups page and view its activity stream and its forum, or you can add this filter to the main activity feed.
I think the structure of the site maybe a little more than you first see by clicking through the menu items, and without a fair amount of content I guess it will be hard to see all the features at work.
The chat is something I am playing around with, I hate that current app so will likely take your advice and go for embedding irc.
The ads again as just there for now, I didn't want to waste space in the sidebar or clutter space in between posts just yet.
Thanks for the comments hope that helped

From the uk it costs £10 from most banks to send a SEPA transfer. You can also do this with mtgox so what's better in your opinion? 
I'm yet to try it purely because they are based in Slovakia and I feel I would have a hard time sorting out any disputes.

There are obviously lots of exchanges and places where people trade bitcoins, you can see most of the individual prices for a lot of them, and a weighted average per currency at
