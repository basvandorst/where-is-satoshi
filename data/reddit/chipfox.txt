You're not the only one... This sub is really turning me off BTC which I didn't think could be possible.
@_date: 2014-09-18 19:06:44
It seems impossible for that to happen, sort of. Anti money laundering would really hinder this I think... maybe not though. Hopefully... I wan't instant 0 fee BTC :(
@_date: 2014-09-26 16:07:53
This is absolutely ridiculous. As if catching a falling knife wasn't bad enough, you have to pay 20%+ for the privilege of getting your hand cut off.
@_date: 2014-09-18 12:29:13
BTC has dropped 5% over the last 24 hours! Even if a merchant was offering a massive 5% reduction and could acquire BTC for 0% fees then it's exactly the same as paying by debit card, or with cash.

I think 7,000 might be a bit on the low side, but there was nowhere near 30,000 coins traded. Everyone is ignoring that part?
@_date: 2015-01-04 12:28:02
That is so of unbelievable...
@_date: 2015-01-04 12:40:19
It would be so cool if pools could collate anon user data to get a better understanding of the miners used. I doubt everyone uses S3s, and I'm sure some are already using S4s. I think 1/10,000 is a safe enough figure.
Still though, crazy stuff.

You are buying their products just to broadcast the word Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-06 19:39:49
At this stage they would be best off pretending Bitcoin didn't exist and let the miners and traders bring it down themselves.
Keep the money

I'm not doubting it, I just wouldn't have believed it without seeing the numbers.
Bitcoin using up to 1/10,000 of the global energy demand is fucked up.
@_date: 2015-01-05 17:21:32
Who are "they"?!
I would suggest that stealing bitcoins is essentially risk free. You can't pin it on anyone, you can't prove it to anyone, and if you don't own the private key you don't own anything.
If it was just one hacker I imagine they are sitting happy without a care in the world, certainly not worried about law enforcement.
@_date: 2015-01-05 16:43:00
Yeah right, offer them 50% of the 100% that can't be taken from them, good luck!
@_date: 2015-01-04 18:07:42
You're not going to jump many hurdles if you intentionally obfuscate your points.

What has this got to do with bitcoin? Target red card can be Visa/Mastercard. Amazon too. They're just loyalty credits.
@_date: 2015-01-04 15:01:59
What is the reality check? I don't know that mining has very little to do with the drop and you don't either.
When there were 50 BTC blocks the price was mostly under half of it was now so it doesn't really make sense.
@_date: 2015-01-04 18:44:27
The biggest bagholder of 2014 wants people to pump his holdings? Yup.
@_date: 2015-01-04 18:16:43
Have you ever looked at a GOLD:USD graph?
@_date: 2015-01-04 18:32:01
Bitcoin is what it is. If it's different to different people then some people don't understand what it is.
You keep saying there are so many killer apps but yet you never actually name one or even suggest what it could possibly be like. That makes me very skeptical honestly
@_date: 2015-01-04 18:10:57
Makes sense. I'm starting to think it's leveraged trading instruments that add huge liqudity to a market that it got it's high spot price almost exclusively because of lack of it.
@_date: 2015-01-04 12:44:07
It's hard to say. Seems like a huge use of power for not really that much activity. Proportionally at least
@_date: 2015-01-06 22:30:11
Fair enough. I thought you meant buy one specifically to do it. That would be stupid
@_date: 2015-01-05 18:19:34
It is risk free, you can just deny you stole them. In that aspect it's case closed, they're gone. No exchange will ever take a customers funds. If they did essentially all bitcoin users from 2011/2012 would already be penniless or in jail for drug dealing. They don't give a shit about the source of your coins.
Why do you keep repeating fungibility in that context? A bitcoin will always equal a bitcoin. Exchanges going belly up has no impact on a bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-04 12:26:38
I imagine the business is run like intended. Mine bitcoins for profit. It's a huge leap to assume that these huge data centres are making those sort of bizarre risks in already a very risky business.
@_date: 2015-01-06 21:13:30
Who does that help apart from people who sell routers?
@_date: 2015-01-04 13:19:07
Like what?
@_date: 2015-01-05 20:19:20
Any large BTC transaction gets high priority with 0 fees. I don't know what large is though, the limit could be 1,000 or 10,000 but I've definitely seen this a few times before.
