for some people having 20k is saving up for 10 years. if you struggle to pay rent isnt it understandble? you sound like a cunt and people rally behind you. if theres any sign that this might be a bubble its comment trees like this. very weird vibe in here.

ok so im one of those guys who got bored and high and obsessed about bitcoin few years back and like put 100bucks into it just to fuck with it.
now its like 2k im like LMFAO, already made 4 people install a wallet on their dumb phones and sent them a bit of cash. they all think its neat.
SO IM DOING MY PART. anyway..
i dont push my worldview on people when i do so...  cus im not a fucking asshole. thats why. and i like a legit reaction. "oh that was fast".
YE NO SHIT SHERLOCK ITS FAST. 
but yeeeee dont be one of those guys talking on and on about how its gonna change the world for the better and every underfed kid in africa gonna rock bitcoin on a nokia like cmon dawg. ye maybe its gonna happen maybe not who knows.
also i have no fucking clue how cryptographic shit works. tried reading what segwit is ye LMFAO no dude i dont get it nor will i ever. so whenever i talk to people about crypto in reallife i say them straight up "i understand it better then you probably ever will dumbass but i still have no clue whats actually happening".
super cranky sorry waiting for my doctors appointment.
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:10:12
thats me just being bored af tbh
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:21:01
my guess is like people buying and selling and uhm price going up and down sometimes not moving much.
youre welcome.
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:30:18
how come everyone said 100k would mean mainstream adaption as a currency and now people hype 1 million because of 5 minute interviews on youtube.

@_date: 2017-12-12 20:30:26

arent most coins dead? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:22:33
its still lucky the price did shoot up like that lol does absolutely not correlate with the personal motivation why someone bought bitcoin.
also how it will factor into the political system is yet to be seen.
try to make more elaborate points of your view instead of doing the good ol "WHERES MY BAILOUT" bullshit. yea its a good point. where is my fucking bailout. but you just sound like an idiot if you do it and no one will take you serious.

how does that diversify. do you think if bitcoin drops to 8-9k it wont affect those other coins?
imho diversity in cryptos is simply betting on a few horses for massive gains.
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:12:03
i think regulation is often seen as an evil. yet people fear that bitfinex is fraudulent and does some shady things with ether.
cant have it both ways. regullation becomes a problem when the regulators dont have the peoples interest in mind. like in NYC : )

you can also download the new client and copy paste the wallet .dat into it and download the blockchain.
make sure to backup that wallet.dat evenif its just a usb stick in case your HD fails ot something.
good luck :)

@_date: 2017-12-20 09:15:53
ok you know this blockchain thing? it confirms that you (your private key) owns a certain amount of bitcoins.
all that stuff about decentralized and proof of work goes out the window when you have it on an exchange.
see its like that. when buy bitcoin on an exchange, you dont really own any bitcoin. all you own is a oldschool database entry that say arlette_123 = 1 bitcoin.
only when you want to withdraw it in either a hardware or software wallet, it truly becomes yours, protected by this boring thing "blockchain" everyone keeps talking about.
you should know what you are buying. start to read into some basics at least.

@_date: 2017-12-17 10:22:41
maybe you would have been mtgoxed, maybe you would have panic selling. who knows you would actually made it to 19k per coin?
a lot of people say "if only back then", myself included. but how many of those would have cashed out as soon as they make 30% gains? all of them.
do you have balls of steel or a gambling addiction? if not you probably would have cashed out early early on.

@_date: 2017-12-17 12:13:32
oh boi thats a lot of money UwU
sadly dont live in the US.
but kraken lets you withdraw 200k with tier 3 verification which is your face with an ID next to it.
it took them about 1 week until i got the clearance. and no i dont have that much money i need tier3 cus of the country i live in.
edit: daily withdraw of 25k, 200k in a month
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:10:19
ok correct me if im wrong but afaik.
if you have your btc on an exchange, you dont really own any bitcoin in the blockchain. its just a database entry linked to your account.
read into what happend to mt. gox. only keep your money on exchanges if you either dont give a fuck or you actively want to trade.
if you have a wallet you own the private key (string of digits/letters) to your bitcoins. you then are responsible to not fuck it up. but at least no exchange can run with your coins.
no coinbase is not the only place to purchase cryptos.
im not an IT guy, i do graphic stuff for a living so you really should get these basics down and at least understand it on a basic level like i do before you get into it.
its interesting and fun to learn. do your homework.
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:11:10
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:53:14
thats uhm. buying coins and selling them in the future at a certain price? right?
so i buy at 10k, i tell you in 4 months im gonna sell them back to you for 12k, you agree. if the price is 14k i made 2k on each coin. if not im gonna jump out the window?

what you do is: go to verfication, you click on what you have in mind and press "next".
then it tells you if you need verification or not.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:02:02
i cant stop.

its still peer to peer &gt;.&gt;
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:19:19
afaik if you actively trade (hodl less than one year). idk what the exact taxation is. google it. no if you buy and hold and not pay out you havent made money. its seen as a currency.
afaik it doesnt matter if you are a "non EU nation" whatever that means. i am neither and my ID verification pic on kraken was no problem. 
so unless you are illegally in germany no exchange should care as long as you have an adress and shit.
you make this way more complicated than it is.
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:03:26
kraken took about a week, but be prepared for the website to spit out an error every second click.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:17:54
busted. shut it down guys.
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:25:13
what i should feel bad now for bureaucracy wtf is wrong with you.
they have to innovate or we move on without them. i have to do the same with my profession so why wouldnt they,
its fucking time for an overhaul. its such a non issue for now.
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:30:33
oh look another shitty website about cryptos who has nothing to offer and just wants a few clicks for ad revenue.
this should be considered as begging imho.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:58:44
im just gonna repeat what ive read a lot.
its fine to take some profits.
dont loose more than you can afford to.
no one knows what the price will do.
also, breathe.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:41:20
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:17:29
paypal wont work.
see.. transactions in bitcoin are currently not reversable. once you do a transaction its done.
with paypal you can be a cunt and say that there is a conflict and halt a process.
so the possibility to scam btc &lt;&gt; paypal is way too high.
my advice is, first learn what you are actually buying. then understand why you need an exchange where you have to provide all your personal info to buy bitcoins and if thats something you want to do : )
always know what you buy!
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:14:46

do you still do it for fun on the side and how long would you say it would take a newcommer to make.. lets say 200 bucks a month as a fun side hussle after work?
how much training and effort did you put into it before making it a profession?
looks like the most fun browsergame out there to me. im curious.

maybe, maybe you can repost once it hits 100k.
who knows. i dont.
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:42:34
i dont think this is an argument for either one. one could argue its just people who want to ride the price but all will panic and sell causing the "bubble" to pop or you could argue that its because its mainstream adaption, people being fed up with current affairs of how money works.
so you are on the same spectrum of "yellers".
fact is that they have 100.000 accounts opened daily. and even that is simply taking his word for it (trust).
that adds even more hypocrisy to your statement, since im sure you praise bitcoin for being a trustless system.
without any statistics, especially geographic statistics, its impossible to draw any conclusion from that tweet.
mainstream adoption will start in countries like venezuela, greece and so on, where there is very little alternative to save your belongings. it wont be the US or old europe. at least thats my opinion and of course i could be wrong. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:46:57

it will in some countries.
some middle class guys here buying a new car because they simply got lucky has nothing to do with the reality of how most societies on this planet struggle to not die of reasons you and i cant imagine.
its really unspectacular that some people get rich. happens not just in crypto, you know. just here you have a lot of idiots who get rich.

its not always the most efficient and superior tech that wins the race buddy.
but i do like the idea that wall street is investing and not just trying to make a quick buck and fuck us over. that be indeed a huge step for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:30:13
ok thanks a lot. i think i made my pick. thanks really for taking the time. for now i just want to get verfied in case i need the money for an emergency.
thank you thank you.
edit: also not trying to sell when i will actually be able to. why do i do this to myself....
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:17:44
i got my bitcoin cash by having a wallet before the split.
i then had to import my private key to a bitcoin cash wallet.
simple as that.
but i did not do any transactions from the fork on.
there are instances and i havent learned yet exactly which ones where the private key changes. so if i ecrypt my wallet it will generate a new private key and therefore, if im already moving in the post fork chain i cant turn back.
so i guess periodical backups from your wallet should be good practice. 
i think there is a sub for this. bitcoin airdrops or something
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:37:05
cmere lets hug it out
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:04:52
yep if you didnt sell you didnt double simple as that.
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:08:35
i see what youre doing.
i payed a shitton of fees back then because i used paypal since i didnt have a CC back then. no idea now i havent bought any btc since then. 
monies tiiight.
i guess trading in person would be the way to stick it to the men. if this thing ever calms down i probably try to arrange a in person meetup with someone and have a coffee geek out on bitcoin and do a trade.

exchanges have nothing to do with bitcoin itself. one bitcoin is always one bitcoin.
when despositing bitcoin on an exchange you effectively own 0 bitcoins in the blockchain. all you now own is an oldschool entry in the database of the exchange where there is one database entry that says GuitarManGod = 0.1 bitcoin
its completly outside of the blockchain.
and since there are different exchanges there are different prices. just like if you have 5 guys standing on the street that trade BTC/USD everyone of those guys would have people standing around him buying and selling and shouting. but the 5 guys who exchange dont talk to each other.
its the people around them that say how much it is worth.

what do you hope to achieve with this?
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:49:20
im so gonna hate myself for not selling now and that after i hate myself for not buying a good chucnk in 2015.
i hate this.
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:20:53
OK THANKS FOR LETTING US KNOW
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:22:04
its fun to think about this isnt it?
when i get my paycheck the state takes a % of it. by law. and thats good. its for when i get sick its for when im out of work and need money to pay rent so i can look for another one etc
but that doesnt have to change just because my money doenst get wired by a bank. i still want my insurances and especially my retirement money. but id much more prefere that money isnt horded by an institution that fucks me every chance they get. there will still be borders and states and governments. we still need democracy. but we dont have a rotten financial system behind it.
for banks starting coins i cant see. andreas anotnopoulus had a wonderful talk about that those systems would fall behind in security, that they arent as robust as bitcoin living in the wild.
and that if banks would put up a faulty system with the current tech if the blockchain would leak you basicly can see every transaction that bank has ever did.
hashing power is interesting tho. i have no clue about cryptography this is way beyond me but i hope there is a way for something like bitcoin without taking this much energy, something more green. but right now transactions are more important to solve first and you can see lightning network probably being introduced soon.
after that the next problem will get tackled!
@_date: 2017-12-16 09:54:31
thats not fully true. the transaction in bitcoin is instant (network recognizing your transaction) but the clearing/confirmation takes time, yes. 
im not sure about wires but i think the banks step in as a security measure, if i would wire you money and one day later id freeze my account claiming identity theft, what would happen to that wire?
now the fees are a huge problem. but you have to realize before the big hype fees have been an non issue. you could aend millions in btc for a few cents. right now is the perfect definition of growing pains. this problem of high fees will be solved in the future i can promise you that.
there are rven other cryptos who completly resolved that issue from the get go.
i think its a bit narrow minded to jump into cryptos right now and critique it for growing pains, you have to see the bigger pictures. its like saying "oo i have to download an mp3 for 5 hours on napster, it would be faster just to go buy a CD at my corner music store".
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:07:19
every crypto is not doing to bad rn thanks to one very special coin :3
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:30:00
do it i dare you
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:39:52
i think we are  way past the stage where being mean in a subreddit will affect bitcoin :D 
but i agree.
its actually interesting to see what fears and struggles appear in here.
have my own fair share so. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:50:08
there are too many shitty crypto newssites
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:10:43
do whats feels right to you. since ur in debt its maybe a game you dont want to gamble on anymore. i only have a handful 1000s riding on this that originated from 100 USD i couldnt care less so i HODL
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:51:41
i fucking love the onion
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:24:43
thanks! will read into it. feels good to be back.
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:00:10
god i hope its some stupid drama stuff like bitcoin cash where i can get 200 USD for free. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:04:05
is there a possibility for mods to stop bots from posting links to "news sites" that are full of ads?
while people complain about questions regarding bitcoin and its price, i myself, browsing new, am bombarded with links that lead to very amateurish newssites clearly only targeted to generate views not spread actual information hence i feel like semi legit newssites should be banned.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:36:43
its not an adaption curve.

ok gimme the breakdown
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:04:32
which would be mainstream adoption if you believe the opening sticky.
i did the same amount back before mtgox crashed. its now worth around 2k USD which is a lot of money for me since i do paycheck to paycheck.
BUT the real value i got out of this is reading into different things. learning. about society about the current financial system about bitcoin about the blockchain and so on.
you wont get rich with 150 USD but i bought i out of fun to see what the big deal about bitcoin is and actually get my hands on a wallet and i did some mining in other coins just to see how my GPU heats up to 100% and see coin flowing into my wallet.
this is whats fun for guys like us you know.
those guys showing their new car in a rich neigbourhood and get like 4k upvotes. let them have fun, let them cry when they piss away their money and their wife shouts at them.
bitcoins true value is that when we hit retirement we wont rely on a currency that isnt worth anything anymore and we worked our hole lifes just to end up in poverty.

by changing positively you mean some fools get rich cus they got lucky?
bitcoin has no effect on the greater public whatsoever.
especially not for the people who actually need it.
OP is the equivalent of a drunk guy in a bar shouting nonsense.

i remember waaay back in the day when all of those fancy exchanges were not around people buy linden dollars (second life currency) and traded it for btc and they accepted paypal.

two factor authentification.
change your passwords.
you can also check if your email and maybe even password was scooped cus of security breaches.

man this better be fucking good im bored af.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:31:18
so your mad at everyone else who does the same thing as you but also mad at you for doing what everyone else does.
maybe dont do it.
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:17:06
im right there with you.
i still dont get why i have to pay fees too. like you pay someone money so that they have all your money. whaaaaaa. i know im breaking this down way too much but the concept itself always messed with my head.
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:18:21
oh yea makes sense. so the counter party is shortening then? how does this make the price less volatile tho? is it because its less daily trading and more betting into the future "calming" down the price?
thanks for taking the time.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:25:28
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:01:24
gladly the network does not care about what we think. :)
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:50:16
even tho im not qualified really to answer that my guess its gonna take over yes. and it hopefully will put a lot of power out of corrupt governments so people dont loose all their money after working hard for 50 years. or simply lift countries out of poverty.
i mean if you think about how much shit you have to do to send money to someone living in another country and yet you are sitting there videochatting with them its really a no brainer things are gonna change.
but i have this dystopian future in my head where superpowers have an arms race for hashpower and wars are fought over miningfarms.
but thats just me. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 08:41:43
economical nightmare considering the waste of energy there.
wont happen. i mean i hope all my worldviews i project on crypto (like everyone does) one day come true but its very unlikely this particular coin will be the default currency considering even an idiot like me could see that keeping up the network and the politics behind that network would be a nightmare. cmon we trying to go green here lets dont forget about that part of our morals. 
by the way did anyone ever do the math how much energy it would cost to power bitcoin if it was the default currency and how that compares to the current system?
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:03:03
if i did i wouldnt care wbout btc tbh
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:53:24
whats your point?
im saying it doesnt have an effect on society YET.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:35:40
you are like an incompetent boss that doesn't care about problems until they start to be an inconvenience to him then all of a sudden its super important to get resolved ASAP.

its hype has gone mainstream, as it did before mtgox crash.
and the financial sector is getting into it.
the tech is sadly no where near mainstream. you know its mainstream when you buy your first coffee with it.

@_date: 2017-12-12 20:45:36
depends. your email is in several lists fulllll of emails that get handed around for possible brute force attacks.
as long as someone cant link the password to your username and your passeword isnt "daddy123" AND you changed your password since the breach, you should be good.
but its the reason two factor auth is so important. because no database where your username and pw sits is safe.
i have different passwords depending on how important my account is. lets say some dumb online site where i have to register just to do something but no REAL value is behind (like crypto or nudes) i use a real simple stupid password. i dont give my real complex password away to every small sites who probably are easy to crack.
