People will be allowed to place bets on what they think the price will become, like is possible with stocks today.
It is not a fork. Bitcoin Core is simply a large group of people that contribute to the Bitcoin protocol, it is not an organization. But what do futures mean for *bitcoin*? Good question. The price of Bitcoin may become more volatile. No one is certain what impact it will have on today's price.

This might be a stupid question, but aren't all cryptocurrencies based around the premise of a public blockchain?  If that's the case, shouldn't every transation in every subsequent currency be viewable given the investigator has enough time and resources to do it?

I haven't been trading for a long time but historically BTC-E was perceived as a bit dodgy.  IIRC the hosts are unknown and it's always had the lurking possibility that it could end in a Gox fashion.  Hence, you get coins at a discount for taking on additional risk.

Order books show you exactly how many coins you can buy or sell at a given price. When an order is filled the market price per coin is raised or lowered based on the price per coin in the latest filled order. When the market purchased 4K coins the order book spread was so great that the overall price grew substantially, ~10%.

I think bitcoin competes with debit/credit cards more from the merchant side than the consumer side.  With consumers, the cashback/points incentive is real.  But as merchants owe ~2-3% of their revenue to processing, they can and will be the ones that need to push adoption by offering slightly discounted merchandise for bitcoin, just as may places offer discounts for cash purchases.

Millions worth is not, generally, life changing money.
*Edit for the downvotes and the fiscally irresponsible:
Millions of dollars are easy to piss away. Life changing implies that you can change your lifestyle forever; not just for a few years. Look at lottery winners. Tens or hundreds of millions of dollars get taxed, spent irresponsibly, and otherwise wasted *all the time*. A million dollars 30 years ago was a huge sum of money but it does not go nearly as far as it does today.  By no means am I a millionaire; I'm not. But even if I got a million dollars tomorrow I wouldn't be able to quit my job b/c I couldn't continue to pay for my mortgage, childcare, expenses, save for my kids' college, and also save for *actual* retirement with that amount of money.  Get over yourselves.

Give them a paper wallet with nothing on it, but tell them there's $25 worth of a BTC there. Odds are they won't do anything to cash in on it. If they do, and find out it's empty, then send them the BTC that would have been $25 worth today (or the day you give it to them).

Definitely not trying to get into a block debate but as I understand it if you had full SegWit adoption we wouldn't require your suggested block size increase. With LN we certainly wouldn't. The danger of increasing the block size has alway been the threatening centralization that comes with it. Increasing the block size makes it harder for individuals to run full nodes.

Good question. At a high level it's because Coinbase can be thought of as a bank and Breadwallet or other wallet apps can be thought of merely a way to access the blockchain/transfer your coins when you please.
The fact that you had to create a 12 word seed to create your wallet means you can recreate the access to that wallet anywhere. You can't do that with Coinbase.
I'm not sure that explained it very well; someone else should chime in. I'm about to go to sleep and def not functioning at full speed.

It's probably lots of things. I heard someone mention that since it's a holiday weekend (in US) that maybe some transfers are being held up. The weekends tend to be wonky in general. Usually when there is a large discrepancy between exchanges it's because there's a range of risk with the exchange itself and/or the ability to get cash *out* of that exchange. Give it a few days and it will even back out.

As others will say: when your coins are stored at Coinbase, you *do not actually control those coins*. Breadwallet is better. A hard wallet/paper wallet are best. Either of the latter ensure you have the private keys to your coins.
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:40:58

Well yeah, possible. Everyone seems to believe that we’ll see another boom/bust cycle that’s magnitudes higher than previous cycles, because that has happened several times before. The real question is when. But no one truly knows, or even knows if that will happen. I’m just a guy on my sofa not a wizard.

It’s a logarithmic scale

True but everything is more ready now than it was for the last bull run. 
Previous bill runs didn’t have LN, or segwit, widespread user friendly apps, a plethora of on-ramp from fiat.
I’d imagine it’s actually good through these cycles that demand outstrips network capacity by a bit because it could spur continued work on the project as the achievable now seems within reach.

They won’t be able to buy mine either! Probably because I sold before that ����‍♂️

Why use 60 min when 13 min do trick?

That is the struggle. You're essentially asking the community: do you think the price will go up or down; and the answer from *everyone* is a collective, "we also can't see the future".

What's wrong with Coinbase/GDAX? I'm in WA and they work for me.
My buddy on the east coast trades with Poloniex but I've never used it.

The boom/bust cycle will continue to happen and it’s good for bitcoin ^^tm

Like any bank account or other “trusted third party”, they are the ones with real control over your coins. They can close your account and your money becomes their money and there’s nothing you can do at that point. Trust them as you will, but know that a large point of bitcoin is to be able to move money without having to trust other people/entities to do the right thing.

But you’re presuming people will be correct when they think it will rise or fall and they won’t be. Retail investors are notoriously bad at trying to time the market. HODLing takes out the guesswork.
