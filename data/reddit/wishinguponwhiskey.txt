Don't believe me? Check the log and you'll find the post that started all of this with Patrick.
I mention this not because it's special, but because it's relevant to the  fact that this hype is nothing but lies. Overstock hasn't chosen to launch on XCP at all.
If you are disillusioned with NXT due to a privately ran exchange, then I am sure you are equally disillusioned by Bitcoin due to MtGox too, and obviously Counterparty due to Poloniex' hack early on?
The decentralized exchange of NXT sucks? lol nice troll
@_date: 2014-02-14 07:00:45
Bitcoin will inevitably be overtaken by a crypto 2.0 like NXT that is 100% decentralized. 
NXT has a decentralized exchange BUILT into it, meaning you can sell/buy without ever worrynig about a third party fucking up like MtGox and several others do all the time.
It also has a Asset exchange, meaning you can do Silkroad deals without ever consulting a third party that bails with all your bitcoins like BlackSheepMarket and Silkroad 2.
Bitcoin had a nice run though and showed us the path, now NXT and the other crypto 2.0s take over
@_date: 2014-08-02 20:12:05
You mean posting the single most relevant post in this entire thread is "pumping" NXT?
No, see, it's just the truth. NXT started this, not Counterparty.
NXT has been in contact with Overstock in the last couple of days and Counterparty has not been chosen whatsoever. It's just lazy journalism and a desperate community being unprofessional as hell.
NXT is the third most succesful crypto (only succesful 2.0) in the world and has been since December. Sorry, we do not need to pump anything. XCP isn't even relevant and hasn't been, ever. Stop trolling, thanks.
@_date: 2014-08-08 04:43:55
So it's like NXT Marketplace with TOR?
@_date: 2014-08-03 11:07:42
Not true at all. This is a frequent, but forever inaccurate misundestanding of NXT.
NXT is Proof-of-Stake, so the term "premined" is completely void of meaning.
All the coins are available on the market from go, it's non-inflationary. Supply &amp; demand decides the valuation, like it should. Everyone is aware of how many coins is in existence at all times and make their buy order accordingly.
@_date: 2014-08-09 10:43:32
No, NXT is far from buying and selling crypto.
NXT has marketplace for any type of goods Asset Exchange (even Overstock is considering listing after we contacted them in May), Smart Contracts under development, Credit system, Monetary system etc.
It's like a crypto OS more than anything
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:43:06
I think this and the silkroad issues only prove 2 things:
1) Bitcoin was the beginning,  NXT//Ethereum/Other 2.0s will continue with the decentralized exchanges that makes these fuckups impossible.
2) The reality of decentralized currencies are here. It's only when people lose the asset that the true value is recognized. A lot of people have been living in a fairytale. No idea why any of you kept a decentralized currency in MtGox or any other centralized exchange.
@_date: 2014-10-01 07:25:45
Yes, when someone comes along and makes you aware of a superior technology that you aren't invested in, they are pumping. 
@_date: 2014-06-06 20:38:11
Except it's not.
Are there big early adopter-stakeholders ? Yea. So is there in Bitcoin. NXTs distribution is actually better than Bitcoins already :)
I suggest you actually do some research.
@_date: 2014-07-30 21:40:19
Given that I am the person who started all of this by getting Patrick Byrne interested NXTs decentralized exchange when he held his AMA here on reddit some months ago, I just have to laugh at the desperation in your title.
It's beyond obvious that you're just another pump and dumper trying to squeeze some money out of your XCP investment with your fallicious and misleading title.
Reality: NXT got Overstocks attention for the decentralized exchange. Patrick Byrne even mentions in his keynote in Amsterdam in May that they are in talks with NXT (which they still are to this day). Overstock has not decided which platform to use yet, they are evaluating which is the most efficient and suitable for their use. Counterparty has not been chosen whatsoever. 
This article is the result of bad journalism, how the journalist failed to even approach anyone in NXT for comment is just plain laziness. 
We have strong faith in the NXT platform, XCP sits ontop of the Bitcoin blockchain and is thus vulnerable and way less efficient and secure than NXT. 
@_date: 2014-10-07 06:35:26
What the hell does that have to do with anything? Branding is branding. The denialism in here makes me puke
@_date: 2014-08-09 20:12:01
NXT already has this integrated in the client, no idea why Bitcoin hasn't
@_date: 2014-10-07 01:22:23
I have personally spoken with the Overstock team several times about this and they've not raised a single concern regarding NXT, quite the contrary.
But clearly they've established a relationship with XCP and then felt that this was the safest route. I still believe it's a mistake, but we'll all have to wait and see.
@_date: 2014-10-07 01:48:39
Crypto 2.0 is a year old and has hurdles to overcome. Naturally it'll take time
@_date: 2014-10-01 08:08:21
It will support whatever technology makes their life easier. 99.99% of people don't care if their software is written in JAVA or C, whatever makes their life easier is the only thing they care about.
People wont even know what the blockchain is and still use it. There is virtually zero hinderance in going from bitcoin to NXT or any other crypto. NXT is exceedingly easy to use, intuitive to understand, light etc. so yes I am confident that NXT stands a much better chance in actually being useful for people and businesses than Bitcoin.
In NXT you can already use the decentralized exchange, we got a built in "Open Bazaar", you can send encrypted messages over the blockchain (very useful for proxy statements when issuing shares), you can soon create your own sub-coins and back them by an asset on the blockchain etc. 
Have a look at the tech tree for yourself  then tell me with a straight face that NXT doesn't offer infinitely more to the general public.
@_date: 2014-06-06 18:11:05
This statement is kind of cute.
NXT isn't a real coin because it's Proof of Stake and a pioneer second generation instead of inefficient old technology like PoW that is inefficient, costly and vulnerable ? :)
@_date: 2014-06-07 09:44:47
No, it was 73 people who invested before the coin existed. Given that it was proof of stake they ended up with all of the coins at the time, yes. Now there is ~37 000 accounts.
Are there still big holders? Of course, but not as bad as Bitcoin.
Is this optimal? Of course not, but it's far from any lethal problem, as the price goes up they sell and distribution gets more even. There will always be some lucky guys who either see the potential or just straight up luck out before everyone else. That is called "life".
@_date: 2014-10-01 06:14:59
Or just launch ontop of NXT who has had a working asset exchange for this exact purpose for half a year which trades millions daily internally in the system.
Also criticizing other cryptos for being volatile (though they are not really that volatile at all when seeing the long run), after Bitcoin's 5 year volatile rollercoaster is just weak.
Projects like NXT offer so, so soo much more, as is evident in how NXT got Overstock interested in the potential of the decentralized exchange.
It's quite sad to see how bitcoiners only care about their own profits and not in building the absolute best blockchain technologies. Bitcoin is also slow as hell compared to NXT due to Proof of Stake vs Proof of Work.
**Edit: sure keep downvoting the rational arguments and ignore the true revolution of the blockchain technology while clinging to your hopes of one day owning a 100 000 USD Bitcoin.**
@_date: 2014-10-04 11:52:49
Indeed. Crypto 2.0 has already arrived a year ago. The chances of the first incarnation of any technology being "the one" is just naive as hell. Google was the 15th search engine.

They didn't go with Counterparty at all. This is just goes to show how desperate they are to exploit this oppourtunity.
Infact all of this started with NXT. NXT (specifically me) pitched the NXT Decentralized Exchange to him. Then this ball started rolling. NXT had several mails and calls with Overstock and even met with Patrick in Amsterdam a whole month before Counterparty even got involved.
NXT decided to keep it professional and not try to exploit the PR. We know we got the best platform and we're confident that will be the deciding factor.
@_date: 2014-10-07 01:11:20
Well you are, NXT already has IPO's daily and million dollar transactions weekly. Also NXT got this whole thing started with Patrick Byrne in the first place. He was convinced by Counterparty devs to go with the "safe" blockchain. Which is obviously lame, but that's how it went

How is that a con? The concept was open to anyone who wanted to invest, some invested earlier than others, these earned more. That is the law of economics. If you started mining back in 2010 you would be richer than someone mining today.
What you are indirectly suggesting is that everyone in the world should get the exact same amount of coins,no matter what. I.E. a communistcoin

Well, if your understanding is deeper, than I apologize for my assumption, but it's odd to me that you don't grasp the decoherence issue then or the severity of the Born Rule problem. Postulating fixes is no better than postulating collapse.
But I'd love to hear your thoughts on retrocausal models

Again, no you seem to have a very superficial understanding of MWI and it's problems and you seem to be reading of wikipedia.
Here is a pretty down to earth explanation of the preferred basis problem that you seem to think is a feature: 
@_date: 2015-01-14 06:24:58
Great initiative, spreading Bitcoin is undoubtably the best move. This is what got Bitcoin this far in the first place
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:57:41
Now I am not taking a position on this, but I just need to point out how flawed your thinking is.
Nothing in Ted Bundys bio would lead you to believe anything either. At the end of the day, facts will talk
@_date: 2015-01-14 06:38:03
No, they did not. Bitcoin was a big and thriving community way before it was a billion dollar industry, way before over half a billion dollars of VC money was put into it and way before these speculators used it.
Sure a lot of people are only in it to get rich, but these overshadow the real purpose of crypto.
@_date: 2015-01-20 09:23:45


Yea... no. MWI is accepted as a philosophical interpretation, but faces a lot of problems like Born rule probabilities not being compatible as well as preferred basis.
In short summary if the Born Rule (which is the reason we believe QM in the first place) gives you an asymmetric probability of something occuring, you run into problems. Say Outcome A is 1% to B 99% and you conduct the experiment. According to MWI there is now 2 universes, which would make the probability 50% vs 50%, but we know from infinite measurements (Again why we believe in QM) that the probability is 1% vs 99%. This has lead some to go in desperate hunts of solutions, but none are accepted as valid.
Then you have the fact that if all there is is a wavefunction, you have no way for decomposing. There is nothing that says "This is a system and this is an environment" so the decoherence programme can't account for why we percieve clear outcomes and not a fuzzy mixture of outcomes.
Plus MWI predicts literal immortality, since there is always a non-zero probability of you surviving ANYTHING in at least one branch. So the probability of you being below minimum a few billion years old is vanishingly small...

We disagree. Bitcoin anno 2015 does not have a solution, it has a lot of proposed solutions which all suffer from some problems. There is nothing wrong with creating a new network for m2m payments, just like there is nothing wrong with a new network for smart contracts or other features. EVERYTHING doesn't need to be on Bitcoins network.


On the other hand, research is always ongoing on how to decentralize mining further. One idea I think could have potential is 21's efforts. Let's see what happens in the next 1 year.
The world doesn't wait, the show must go on. The market finds a way. 21 Inc's currenty business strategy is very odd and makes no sense for IoT. IoT devices will often need low energy consumption, it makes NO SENSE whatsoever to fill a device with an ASIC just to have a few satoshis in it at all times. 


We (team of IOTA) actually came up with the concept for this crypto as a result of our semiconductor start-up that is creating a processor to address some of the issues with Moore's Law, so we are painfully aware of this market. Moore's Law has been exhausted, in fact it was NEVER a law to begin with. It was INTEL's SMaC recipe, there was never anything inevitable about it and now quantum mechanics is starting to say: "Sorry, think creatively to move ahead".


And you see this as something that is easy to achieve, why?


Which trade-off comes from IOTA's quantum resistance?

Lightning network is a really interesting approach from an academic point of view, but it's not without severe flaws. As can be read in this [paper](
Additionally Lightning Network, even if they could resolve all its own problems, does not answer the other problems of the blockchain as mentioned [here]( in the Tangle vs Blockchain section.
Ultimately IOTA is designed from the bottom up to be a pure micro-transactions currency that solves these issues rather than trying to patch a completely different design which only leads to severe deficits on all regards (flexibity trade offs).
Lastly you presume that Lightning Network will somehow be implemented within 12 months, what do you base this on?

@_date: 2015-03-09 15:23:59
You should not go by market value or market share. Bitcoin is miniscule on all scales compared to other payment methods and the reply to this is that "bitcoin needs more time, but has better functionality". Well alts like Nxt, Bitshare, Ethereum etc. all have better functionality than Bitcoin, so if you're going to dismiss them due to their relative size to Bitcoin, then you also have to dismiss Bitcoin vs all other financial instruments.
@_date: 2015-10-31 23:29:42
I wouldn't really say you answered his/her question.
The whitepaper is written by a math PhD for a deeper understanding, because it's a whitepaper, not a layman explanation. No idea why you would expect something easy to understand from a highly technical whitepaper. Whitepapers are for academics and skilled devs to evaluate the validity of a proposal, not for mainstream adoption.
The layman explanation is easy to understand for anyone with basic understanding of how blockchain works. IOTA is exceedingly simple, way simpler than Bitcoin to understand. It's pure transactions, nothing else.
It can still communicate with Bitcoin's blockchain via checkpointing transactions or acting as an oracle for bitcoin smart contracts, if bitcoin ever adopts something like Rootstock. 
Currently (and for the forseeable future) bitcoin wont be a micro-transaction platform anyway, so it should start looking for projects like IOTA to work in synergy instead.
@_date: 2015-03-12 16:48:46

@_date: 2015-03-09 16:22:39
Nxt, Bitshares, Ethereum.
Nxt provides all the functionality that Bitcoin *hopes* to have in 5-10 years, plus it's ~10 times as fast.
Bitshares is similarly a platform with a lot more utility already existing.
Ethereum promises to be a great platform for developers with the use of Smart Contracts.
Thinking that the decentralized revolution that the blockchain enables is only contained to p2p transfer of currency is extremely naive. Almost as naive as thinking that the first iteration of a brand new technology is the best one
@_date: 2015-10-31 23:19:35
IOTA is not meant to replace blockchains, but supplement them. IOTA has no fees and allows for a very high # of tx per sec, making it ideal for micro-transactions.

Did I ever say Bitcoin is bad? I hold a 3 digit number of bitcoins, so no I have a lot of faith in Bitcoin, but this denialist logically fallicious way of arguing in favour of Bitcoin while ignoring real innovation of competing platforms makes Bitcoiners look bad.
Also I am not talking about copycat coins like LiteCoin or DogeCoin. Let's take Nxt, it's WAY simpler to use than Bitcoin, it's 10times faster than Bitcoin and you have a 100% decentralized store ( Yes exactly like Open Bazaar, except it already exists and works ), you have a decentralized Asset Exchange that has been operational for soon a year etc. So ignoring it just because it's smaller than Bitcoin would be downright stupid
