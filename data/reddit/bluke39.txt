This is why multi-sig and also decentralized marketplaces like OpenBazaar and ShadowMarket are needed to solve the problem with decentralization and a trustless system.

We need decentralized marketplaces like Open Bazaar, and ShadyBay.

Why Monero, and not one of the other cyrptonote clones?  Monero has significant problems.  You must use mymonero web wallet and give away your anonymity if you want to hold Monero. They don't even have a functional GUI wallet for beginners. Also it has significant blockchain bloat. 
ShadowCash is a much better solution and implements ring signatures onto a bitcoin blockchain.  They also use a token system similar to zerocash, and will be implementing zkSNARKS once they are fully out and trusted.  Also they are implementing a decentralized marketplace similar to Open Bazaar and also have encrypted chat messenging right within the official HTML wallet (first of its kind.)
Also you mention shapeshift.io.  Notice they have not implemented Monero, yet they do have ShadowCash.  That is because Shadow is on a bitcoin blockchain and can plug into existing infrastructure much easier.  Also Shadow is not just a clone of cryptonote, its an original system designed by the devs.

There is also [ShadowMarket]( in progress too.  ShadowMarket will use ShadowCash an anonymous currency using elements from cryptonote ring signatures and zerocash minting.
They already have encrypted messaging implemented within their wallet as well.  I like it better than open bazaar because of the anonymous tokens, and also the marketplace will exist right within the official wallet.

Hopes and promises. Why use MyMonero web wallet and give away your privacy?  I thought Monero was supposed to be for privacy.  ShadowCash has already delivered on the GUI HTML wallet.  Plus they have a better roadmap and will implement zkSNARKS in the future when they are fully out and trustless.

Also good for [ShadowMarket](
