**Think a Bit Different**
[here are my two cents]( inspired by the golden comment from &gt;"Here's to the greedy ones. The conformists. The fatcats. The soft-fascists. The chisels forcing all the pegs to fit in the square holes. The ones who will make you see things their way. They make the rules. And they protect the status quo. You can support them, cooperate with them, worship or fanboy around them. About the only thing you can't do is compete with them. Because they run things. They keep the human race in line." – Apple, Inc. (translated into plain English from sloganese)
