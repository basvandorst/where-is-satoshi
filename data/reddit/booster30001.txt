Yeah, and there MIGHT be a floating teacup up there in space, right next to Pluto 
@_date: 2014-01-06 17:51:53
lol, how old are you?
@_date: 2014-01-07 00:39:59
Until you have both your feet on the Caribbean, you got scammed

Fastest is Coindrip but it's pricy.

No, you don't get me. People are telling you to post a draft here of the article. I highly suggest you don't do that. I know people who went on other websites to ask for critiques of their rough draft. When they turn it in, they get it back as a fail and they are considered to have plagiarized. It doesn't matter if they can prove they are the ones who put it up themselves, they plagiarized from themselves. Sounds retarded but I know plenty of people who got busted for this.

Does Mt. cox even count anymore? It's shit
@_date: 2014-01-13 23:32:35
Then they will just say he plagiarized
@_date: 2014-01-07 00:48:01
I don't. It's just nigger cacophony.
@_date: 2014-03-10 04:17:41
What a terrible explanation. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 00:38:26
Clear scam and the fact that you think people would even fall for it makes me lose faith in humanity 
@_date: 2014-01-07 00:56:29

It's currently at 32% and climbing. So, in five days are we going to get that mass panic again?

The more people mine in a pool, the more frequently they get rewards. If they split up, they split up their rewards.

Again, a simple question that gets reposted a million times everyday.
@_date: 2014-01-09 15:53:29
I don't need to.
@_date: 2014-01-08 20:09:41
It isn't and your disbelief is stupid.
@_date: 2014-01-06 18:37:46
Ponzi scheme. SCAM!!!!
@_date: 2014-01-07 00:46:15
So basically show them how insecure bitcoin is? What a wonderful idea 
@_date: 2014-01-06 23:08:18
Oh, look, the same old tired ass question that's posted a million times a day.
@_date: 2014-01-13 00:16:34
Your father died? AHAHAHAHAHAHAH
@_date: 2014-01-07 00:45:05
What? I am aware he is reporting
But it's pointless that he is reporting. It's like me saying "IF SOMEONE SAYS TO HAND OVER YOUR MONEY THEY WILL STEAL YOUR MONEY" like, no shit
@_date: 2014-01-14 00:03:22
Sorry, but what an idiot. I like bitcoin but why would anyone do this
@_date: 2014-01-08 19:44:00
So edgy
@_date: 2014-01-07 00:58:13
So basically promote this day trade bullshit?
@_date: 2014-01-07 00:57:44
Shitty scam, move on
@_date: 2014-01-06 18:08:05
6 months? 1,400.
1 year? 2,300
5 years? 7,000

Mining is not profitable anymore.
@_date: 2014-01-06 18:02:31
How do I know you aren't going to scam me? It'd be very easy to do so.
@_date: 2014-01-07 01:19:27
And the last
@_date: 2014-01-06 18:23:12
@_date: 2014-01-06 17:55:04
So say that I had Bitcoins to sell to you. If I get the payment within hours, how long will it take for me to be able to completely access it on my bank?
@_date: 2014-01-09 20:35:10
Exactly as the other guy said. I'm about to buy a TV with bitcoin and I'm gonna show my parents so they can see how this "fake money" can get us real and useful items. I see the option too and I smiled as I saw it
@_date: 2014-01-13 19:22:40
I left just because it asked for my age. What is this, some porn site?
@_date: 2014-01-07 00:47:25
Saw the guy in the guy Fawkes mask and cringed. 
@_date: 2014-01-13 22:41:28
Any trips by bus?
@_date: 2014-01-16 16:01:22
It won't be "at least a year". That's way too much. My instinct says 3-4 months. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 23:05:17
At least you're reasonable unlike all of hear virgins here.
@_date: 2014-01-07 00:58:41
@_date: 2014-01-07 00:48:40
Yeah, take this nerd shit out of this sub
@_date: 2013-12-06 06:20:48
I agree. This website was started by a Redditor, I believe, and I thought it was sketchy from the start.
