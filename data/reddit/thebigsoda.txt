Yep. Had people today going on about how they "told me it was a scam!", not realizing that I've *spent* more USD worth of Bitcoin than I initially bought, and I'm still at a decent profit.

I can absolutely concede that - making money off of it doesn't make it not a scam. I think that a decent portion of people holding any sort of crypto *knew* that there was a huge bubble. Any reasonable person could see that level of growth was unsustainable forever.


Agreed entirely. It seems to be cryptos are viewed as crashing (and therefore a scam), rising slowly (and therefore meaningless), or skyrocketing (and therefore a bubble) with no level of in-between. Everything is still new and volatile enough to where it's really hard to tell exactly *where* something stands and where it will go.

IIRC from the story, he paid someone the 10k BTC to purchase the pizza, but didn't send it to the pizzeria himself.

Morally? Probably not. But it probably speaks a lot about someone's mindset. If someone else is doing something for you, it's easy to distance yourself from the reality of it.
