For btc to make sense as a currency the price has to stabilize. Bitcoin as a currency and bitcoin as a get-rich-quick investment vehicle are mutually exclusive.

By this definition none of the events that are known as stock market crashes have been crashes. Do you think that is a sign of a good definition?

I see! Thank you for pointing that out, that went right over my head.
I linked to a standard google search with the terms "silent circle warrant canary" to  emphasize that OP could have easily found a source on their own. I will make sure to directly link to an article in the future. That is also less passive-aggressive.
As for your points towards the topic of this thread, I think the much more basic truth is that the effectivity of warrant canaries themselves is somewhat doubtful, [as their legality has not been tested in court]( [they are in fact banned in Australia]( and [securtiy researcher Moxie Marlinspike has come out an said that " that having a "canary" you remove or choose not to update would likely have the same legal consequences as simply posting something that explicitly says you've received something."]( Now I don't know jack about the credibility of that researcher, but I know that courts aren't dumb, and as such I find it plausible that warrant canaries just plain don't work.

Since the Google search I linked to found plenty of articles on ops question, I don't quite get your point, sorry.
Edit: Reread your post, you are correct, I do not use Tor. I don't know why you think this is important, but you are right.
