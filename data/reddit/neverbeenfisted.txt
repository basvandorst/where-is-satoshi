I initially tried NAB Visa Debit &amp; Credit, ANZ Visa &amp; even my GO mastercard (not that I was going to use it), all failed.  Spoke to NAB &amp; they told me they accepted the request from Circle &amp; it was them rejecting the card.  Now on Circe if I click add funds I get a message that my country isn't supported &amp; no option to even try to add funds

You dont get the option to add a card, when you click on Fund Account you get a message your country isn't supported

I tried them for the first time the other day but the one person that offered a decent rate didn't respond to messages.  Currently trying Igot but takes a while to become verified.

Well now the Tax office has decided that 10% GST (Goods &amp; Sales Tax) is payable on purchases, the exchanges had to incorporate it. 
So unless you are happy paying 10% extra on BTC price the answer is with great difficulty &amp; frustration

Circle doesn't work for me in Aus even though for others with the same issuing bank and card it works fine.  There support tell me that it's only supported the the USA.
