I doubt he has EVER received a bitcoin transaction. It'd cost like $10 in fees lol.

If a fork happens don't move your coins, you're gonna have them in both forks. Then wait a long time to see which one is better

That's sad. I'd recommend trade using BitSquare, and I think there's even a solution in where a third party can act as a judge and revert the bitcoins in cash transactions, but it'd be easier if you guys did it all online via the banking system

THAT's why I ALWAYS tell companies like 1password.com to buy an EV SSL certificate, but they won't. shapeSHIT could have an SSL certificate too, but not an EV one... I bought 1passvvord.com just to show them this but they refuse to buy it. EV is the answer.

the fake domain could have a SSL too, don't know why it does not, since the process is automated and free. The answer is to have an EV certificate, that appears as the green bar.

a wallet is just an abstraction, the thing that really exists are addresses, each one with its specific private key. Some bitcoin wallets though will generate these private keys from a master private key, so you don't need to backup all of them, just the 'seed'. To make it easier to write, they'll generate a seed made of english words, so you can write into a paper.

When it'll be possible to spend entirely through SMS? That's the only way people would really use bits they received. I guarantee majority of people will not download it just to spend some bits
@_date: 2017-03-27 04:17:45
When mobi was advertised, it was promised that anyone in the world would be able to receive bitcoin; it was implicit that anyone with a SMS device would be able to spend the bits. As of today, sending money through mobi is the same as sending a SMS to a friend saying that he should download copay or breadwallet, with the only downside being asking him to send an address back. 
The only thing that justified inducing the receiver to not truly own his bitcoins was that it would be much easier to use by sending simple SMS commands. In the way it's today, there's no reason to induce a bitcoin newbie to have his bitcoins in the cloud. First because it's against bitcoin's purpose, and secondly because of the potential of it being stolen. So the only possible reason why I would induce a newbie to have bitcoins in the cloud was because of its extreme ease of use through SMS. If an app is needed, there's no reason for the bits to be in the cloud (except because of today's high fees, so it's easier to not transfer between addresses, but just change ownership in the server, but that's gonna change in the future).
If I put some bits in a private key (a 12 word phrase for example) and send it through twitter, telegram, or even SMS, telling the person to download copay, breadwallet or any other app to use it, that's already better than mobi, because I wouldn't be trusting any servers, and I didn't even need any infrastructure to do it.
In fact, a simple SMS service that consume private keys to send to other bitcoin addresses would solve this all. I just needed to send an SMS, telegram message, or direct message with the following: "Hey, I just send you x bits, send [private key here] to [sms_service_number] to spend it", and then the SMS service number would start a dialog asking for the address to send to.
Even if mobi is what is supposed to be what is now, I don't see a reason why the person won't get his bits to a private key owned by him inside mobi's wallet after he downloaded it. It's much more secure, the mobi's server would only hold the bits until the receiver downloads the app. 
The only reason I kept mobi installed was because I thought this SMS feature would be included. When I used changetip, people wouldn't even authorize changetip to access their twitter accounts (just basic info) in order to receive the bits I send them, which is much more convenient than downloading an app, so I'm sure they will not download mobi for the purpose of receiving bits.
If, however, the true purpose of Mobi is to be a virtual card app, I like it, but other solutions like Tenx and Plutus allow (or will allow) me to truly hold the coins unless I pay something through the card (instant conversion), which is much more secure.
Also, Mobi keeps running in the background of my Android. I don't see a reason for that, and it it's extremely annoying.

too dangerous
a mobile app would boost the usage and still be descentralized

how can you be so smart to have 125 BTC but so dumb to leave them in an exchange
@_date: 2017-04-22 09:17:45
These math problems can be anything hard to compute, so you can prove that you did a lot of work. It happens that cryptographic hash functions are good for this, because it's extremely hard to find a number that is mapped to something interesting like a string with many zeros or a string with SatoshiNakamoto12356 or anything that would appear only one time in a zillion, but once you find such number that maps to it, it's easy for people to verify that this number indeed maps to this odd string or number. Based on this, they know you spent a lot of computer power to find such string/number and will accept your mined block. You cannot generate new coins because the entire network entered in consensus about the rules of the game: only the person that found this magic number/string can generate coins, but a limited amount of it (12.5 bitcoins currently). The difficulty of finding such number/string is adjusted based on a rule that everyone agreed, so only one block is generated every 10 minutes (approximately)

I agree that there's no incentive for Ledger to be malicious, but as I also mentioned in the post, there could be bugs in the ecdsa signing implementation, which doesn't require economic incentives. Also, there is a really big economic incentive for hackers to invade Ledger and somehow infect the  firmware. If the firmware could be built byte-to-byte on any machine then it'd eliminate this problem.
@_date: 2017-09-03 04:54:28
Yes, when I received my Ledger, I immediately thought about random number generation having flaws, and did the seed input myself. They say that the signature is deterministic, but you cannot be sure it'll always be. As I said, rich Bitcoin addresses could be targeted, or vanity addresses could trigger a backdoor. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 15:13:53
Did you read the part about the ECDSA? It's not trustable unless you see the source code. A secure chip is as secure as the firmware that runs on it. 
Also, you shouldn't need to blindly trust a wallet, that's why the others are fully open source. For example, if Ledger really wanted, they could simply release an update with all the mentioned flaws and no one would notice until it's too late.

Google has thousands of nodes around the world. They're descentralized then?

Only one person can compile the app, so it's enough for the compiling computer to be infected. No need to change the source code, they just need to alter something in Gradle or even in a repository that is pushed through Android Studio. Remember when this exact problem happened to the Transmission BitTorrent app on OS X, and lots of iOS apps got malware injected into them by a malicious xcode version. We can't trust hundreds of thousands of bitcoins in the security of just one developer's computer. No matter how smart the developer is, there is a millionare incentive to infect his computer, it's much more than the cost of a 0 day exploit. Being smart can't help against unknown exploits.
