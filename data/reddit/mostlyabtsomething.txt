What is the average costs of a BTC transaction vs a BCH transaction?
@_date: 2017-10-08 20:44:49
No. The difficulty on the Bitcoin Cash network is much lower.

With Electrum you have to connect via a third party server, you request the balance for each address you own. So you will follow whichever chain that server is following.
You are free to connect to servers which will be following the longest chain however. No new client side fork of Electrum will be required since no changes to the transaction format has been made. Users will be able to connect to which ever chain they wish to. But as there is no replay protection users will have to be careful if they don't want transactions being replayed on either chain. 
"True" spv nodes (such as Breadwallet) will connect to the Bitcoin network directly and randomly connect to various nodes, and request transactions via bloom filters. Offers slightly better privacy if that is something which concerns you. 
Once your SPV client connects to a node which is following the 2x chain, it will see this new chain as the longest chain with the most proof of work. After this it will not follow the 1x chain, so long as the 2x chain remains the longest.

SPV clients will follow the longest chain with the most proof of work, they do not verify the size of blocks. 
If a chain comes along which has blocks 2x, 3x, 8x, so long as it has the most proof of work, SPV clients will follow this chain. 
As the majority of users have these types of client, for them, Bitcoin will be whatever the longest chain is with the most proof of work.

Difficulty increases by a set algorithm. 
SPV nodes know this algorithm. 
Difficulty is measured by the number of leading zeroes the hash of the last block header must contain. 
For Bitcoin Cash, the number of leading zeroes the hash of the last block must contain is much lower than the main Bitcoin chain. 
SPV nodes download the block headers from full nodes, they can verify that each block they receive contains a valid hash of the latest block they have, plus that it matches the current network difficulty. 
As the difficulty is much higher on the Bitcoin chain, we know more work/effort has gone into finding blocks in this chain, than on the Bitcoin cash chain. 
Therefore Bitcoin has the longest chain with the most proof of work. 
It's not just the block height which matters. It's height+difficulty.

btc1 was an agreement by many of those involved in Bitcoin to first activate segwit, and then to increase the blocksize. 
Without the agreement, segwit wouldn't have activated.

What sized block do you believe a RPi can handle now?
@_date: 2017-10-08 14:27:40
Isn't the aim of the NYA to increase the blocksize and reduce transaction costs for all?
I guess we should thank them.

Do we have a good way to measure consensus?

Could it not be argued that a single git repo with a select number of committers, is also a form of centralisation?
@_date: 2017-10-17 17:53:20


Can you explain this further? What sized block do you believe a RPi can handle now?
Furthermore, why is the RPi the yard stick which we decide how big the blocksize can be?
@_date: 2017-10-07 12:56:24
You could have said the same thing about Segwit I guess?

But won't they have Bitcoin from before the fork that they want to spend over time?
Perhaps they still receive Bitcoin from other people as payments?
@_date: 2017-10-17 17:34:29
Some might argue this is already happening. 
@_date: 2017-10-07 13:57:38
Perhaps they just want lower transaction costs so they can spend the Bitcoin they have without losing too much in fees?

Longest chain **with the most proof of work**. 
Bitcoin Cash does not have the longest chain with the most proof of work.
