It's a 2of3 wallet where coinbase has 1 key for convenience; they can't steal your coin with 1 key and you don't even need them to spend the coins. Others in this thread have linked to the official page about it. 
@_date: 2016-08-24 19:24:19
Actually that's exactly what it does
@_date: 2016-08-19 18:03:31
I totally agree. My first PR for the project was to get tests started. It was merged but it took awhile so once it was I didn't have time to contribute anymore. 
How much are these concerns reduced by the 2.0 branch? 
I still have some concerns with coinjoin in general since other participants actions after I've made my transactions can reduce my anonymity.
It is nice bring a maker and earning some coin though.

Websites only treat you differently if you are running an exit node. I run a relay that doesn't allow exits and a hidden service. When I had it configured as an exit node there were definitely sites that made me solve captchas constantly.

Have you read the study showing the hardware requirements for 1TB blocks? While it’s expensive, it’s possible with today’s technology. What makes you so sure block size increases aren’t a sustainable path?
Also, that isn’t the only scaling they have planned. Check out the various roadmaps. 
The core team plans on keeping block space very expensive because they believe that is necessary for Bitcoin to function. That will always be a major difference between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. 
Of course small blockers believe that block space will inevitably becomes of expensive in the long term regardless of the Cash developer’s desires. I’m glad Cash exists so that we can find out if that belief is correct or not. Lots of people had believed Bitcoin impossible until they saw the code actually working. The same could happen with Cash.

Even the LN whitepaper says we need 133MB blocks to support the world. But that is counting people and I thought that cryptocurrencies were supposed to open up a whole world of machine to machine payments. That means that we will need even bigger blocks than that, right?

I’m simply calling you out for saying “Bitcoin Core was worked on by Satoshi himself and is the true Bitcoin, not XT and not classic.” That doesn’t make any sense. Satoshi worked on the client before it was even called “Core” and so contributed equally to all of them. 
But actually yes, I think Bitcoin Cash is more Bitcoin than Bitcoin Core. The white paper title says “cash” not “settlement layer.”

Running a core node won’t help you setup lightning. It uses a different backend. From the LND readme:

Well you saw my reply, so automod rules must have lightened up. I’m not going to change how I talk here for fear of bots or mods. Core fees are insane and not a sign of success.

Block headers don’t scale with the block size and verifying with SPV security is plenty sufficient for most users. Sure, we shouldn’t jump to 1TB blocks today, but there’s plenty of numbers between 1MB and 1TB. Have you seen this?

There is an open issue on their GitHub 
@_date: 2015-06-27 17:05:53
Oh I didn't realize that was the 2013 link.
Here is a quote from 2015 that made me want to look up the show notes in the first place ( "I mean, it blows FIDO away. The guy who designed FIDO said SQRL blows it away."
Key lifetime management is extremely important to me. If I need to migrate from one key to another or revoke a key for any reason, I don't believe FIDO has anything to handle that.
He talks about key management more in  "There's a lot of problems with FIDO. For example, FIDO doesn't have any identity management at all. That is to say, if your identity escapes from you with FIDO, there's nothing, there's no mechanism in FIDO for remediating it, for recovering it, for pulling it back. All of that is built into SQRL. **So this is why Brad Hill, who was one of the chief architects of FIDO, said he thought SQRL was the best-thought-out system that he had seen.**"
 goes into more detail
He has talked a lot about FIDO vs SQRL this year as SQRL gets closer to being complete.   and more.
@_date: 2015-06-26 16:22:30
SQRL keys are derived from a 256 bit private key very much like bitcoin addresses from an HD wallet.
There is also some shared crypto. 
@_date: 2015-06-26 16:20:11
SQRL has support for revoking and replacing keys. I don't think BitID does and that seems like a big problem to me
I think someone should make a SQRL client that uses an HD wallet mnemonic and then the backups of my coins could also be used to backup my identities. I already have to store 24 words securely offline so I think we should make the most of them.

From 
● Concerns:
○  Hardware token based, so never free.
○  Per-site storage in the device, or a kludge to hand off to server.
○  No handling of key lifetime management
○  Appears to be MASSIVELY over designed.
○  Still a second factor.
○  Entrenched Biases:
Google wants multi-factor in browser
Yubico wants hardware token.
Everyone has their territory to protect.
○  $25,000/year "dues" to have any access to what's going on.
●  SQRL *feels* more like the Internet -- clean, simple, lightweight, open and free.
○  No per-site storage to copy between devices.
○  100% free.
○  Extremely lightweight
●  I think there’s room for SQRL even if FIDO happens.
○ SQRL is SO LOW FRICTION that it can be easily used.

I guess it does give an incentive to hosting, but it's a disincentive to mine so you will be paying fees to people that you could mine just fine without.
Why is spreading the rate around needed if p2pool is "at critical mass?"
Edit: oh. Not all miners would be automatically routed, just some portion that use the modified p2pool.  I think some sort of proxy that picks the "best" node would be good. Then low resource systems don't need the full share chain and all that (I think it's around 400MB of ram on my public node)

I think it will require a few code changes. Right now there are public lists of public nodes, but they are all hand compiled and p2pools peer list endpoint shows the p2p port, not the worker port.
I started adding a flag to run_pool.py at 
It doesn't work yet, but Once it works, it should be possible to discover public peers in a more decentralized fashion. 
From there I think bundling a proxy into p2pool that ranks the known public nodes somehow could work.

That hash rate is based on the pool, not the node. The pool shares that difficulty the same way Bitcoin network does, but the difficulty is set to keep the pool mining a share every 20 seconds. It used to be 10 seconds, but it was increased to support mining with some newer hardware at higher intensity.
The only difference you might see between the different nodes is fees and maybe network/bitcoind latency
@_date: 2014-03-18 02:10:18


If the tips are off-chain, I don't see how this could possibly work.  They wouldn't be able to give you a private key that controls only your coins if they aren't on chain. Maybe they keep it off-chain unless you've exported the keys?  I don't see anything about that in my searching though.
@_date: 2014-03-11 04:30:44
@_date: 2014-01-09 05:47:03
Most traditional pools pay based on difficulty 1 shares.  p2pool pays based on a floating difficulty that keeps the miners getting 1 share every ~20 seconds.  This floating difficulty is currently 946000.  If you put that into a mining calculator as the difficulty, the calculated time to mine a block will actually be the a time to mine a p2pool share.  
I put in 3 GH/s with difficulty 946000 at  and it gave me "Average generation time for a block (solo):	15 days, 16 hours (can vary greatly depending on your luck)"
That means it will likely take over 2 weeks to find a SINGLE SHARE with 3GH/s on p2pool.  Now when you find it, that share is worth more than a difficulty 1 share on a normal pool, but the variance is too much for most people to handle.  Plus the fees on a ton of tiny payouts aren't great

I think Silk Road gained strength through the *required* use of Tor. Running this with Tor and setting up hidden services is more work, but I think is necessary for a secure trading platform.
Ensuring it doesn't leak anything sensitive like an IP needs to be something thought of from the beginning. If Tor is required, there is no chance of users connecting improperly and exposing their IP to peers. If it's optional and not used for everything, less people will use it.
If this is just a prototype to show off how the basics can work and what libbitcoin can do (as the video suggests), I hope subsequent projects use Tor or similar to improve the security.

I don't see any reason to spread the hashrate across different nodes. I think one of us is missing something. What problem are you trying to fix?
If there were 100 p2pool nodes and only 1 miner, it would be fine for that one miner to mine on only his node. The other 99 nodes would still work to validate shares and broadcast blocks and transactions. No network security is improve by spreading the hashrate around different nodes

I've been looking at decentralized storage for a long time, but they all have problems of some kind and usually don't have incentives to keep a drive online. I'm really curious how you keep people providing storage.

"B. an open-source pool that allows cgminer/bitminter/etc connections, like existing pools, but on the back-end it's P2P"
p2pool seems to fit this, doesn't it? I mined with cgminer on p2pool back when I mined. Saying "read the post" is not helpful. If people are asking questions, they clearly need more information.
What part of p2pool is the least user friendly for you?  I assume git cloning something and running python from the command line is already too hard for "an idiot" and I agree with you there.
Do you just want something like p2pool-magic-miner.exe that you double click and it starts mining with whatever hardware you happen to have without configuration? Do you care about having to wait a day for the blockchain?
Ensuring the right drivers and such is not exactly trivial.  If you really want it idiot-proof, you will probably have to bundle a lot of things into this.  bitcoind + p2pool + drivers + cgminer is a lot of things to setup plus you need the ports open on your firewall, too.
Not exactly the unix philosophy to have all these in one executable.

I don't think being deflationary is bad. However, I also don't think being inflationary is bad. What I do think is bad is uncertainty. With crypto currencies, the rate of deflation or inflation is known. And with known rates, everyone is on equal footing and can make informed decisions about the value of their money in the future.  This is what I find valuable compared to fiat where the inflation or deflation is subject to the whims of a government.

They aren't impervious to hacking, but if they get hacked then the hacker only has 1 key and with a 2-of-3 wallet, you need 2 keys. The hacker would have to hack you and coinbase to steal your coins in coinbase vault. 
@_date: 2017-02-10 06:14:21
You have to wait if you want coinbase to sign the transaction. You don't have to wait for that though. You can simply use the 2 of 2-of-3 keys that you hold and you can move your coins immediately without having to wait for coinbase at all.  Normally that second key is kept offline, but it's available for you to use any time you need. 
If coinbase disappeared right now and all their servers were deleted or leaked, your coins in coinbase vault would be perfectly safe unless you also got hacked.

Okay. Perfect is asking too much. You (and lots of others in this thread) present Web of trust with some undefined weighted feedback and Multisig transactions like they are enough, and I'm not convinced.
While a Web of Trust and Multi-sig escrow help prevent some fraud, do they really do it any better than moderated user reviews and a centralized group who have powers like eBay's fraud team has over eBay's user accounts?  Can it even do it well at all?  We'll see once OpenBazaar gets more developed, but I've yet to see proof.  Fighting fraud is a constant, ever-changing thing that costs eBay lots of money and frustrates a lot of users.  I think it will be harder, not easier, in a decentralized market.
I think that for a Web of Trust to work, we need a good way to actually browse it and see where the trust is coming from.  Does anyone know of any tools to actually do this?  A graph like  is not enough, and sig2dot is the only thing I've seen and it isn't very featurful or interactive.  Just having the web isn't enough.
We also need a tool that makes finding trusted arbiters inside your Web of Trust easy.  I think OpenBazaar is already working on this.

But how bad would that even be? Let's say there are only 2000 open full nodes only run in data centers but still spread around the world. What is so bad about that?

While I agree that the blocks would probably not immediately jump to 8mb, no one can say how fast they would take to fill. I don't think looking at historical adoption is a good way to know. When things go big in the Internet, they seem to go big really fast. Some cool blockchain-backed service 10x more popular than satoshi dice could come out and fill all the demand that big blockers claim has been stifled by small blocks and we could be at 8Mb really fast. 
I'm really not sure how big a deal initial block download and sync really is. It seems to be the latest boogeyman of small blockers though. I'd think measuring at what point a new low powered node could never catch up would be useful data, but I haven't seen those numbers.

Yeah... exactly...
Unless you are running an old version of core, you will be downloading the Segwit data and will end up using more bandwidth. 
Both bigger blocks and Segwit increase both network and disk usage. AFAIK the code to prune Segwit data is not written yet. Even when/if it is written, you still have the bandwidth increase to deal with. 
If your node can't handle 2mb BU blocks because of the traffic increase, it isn't going to be able to handle Segwit blocks either. Sorry

@_date: 2014-01-10 05:30:35
Yeah. But that's not the clarification I was looking for.
I think Kerstn is talking about having p2pool automatically spread miners around the different nodes.  I think this is targeted at miners who can't or don't want to run a full p2pool node and bitcoind but still want to mine on p2pool. I'm not sure if I'm reading it right though.
Maybe someone could write a little proxy that finds the best available p2pool based on things like fees and latency and I guess hashrate to reduce the chance of one node having a high percent of the pools rate?  I guess this could be rolled into p2pool directly. Might be a fun project.  I bet one of those old pool hopping programs could be modified to do this.
Edit: re-read another of kerstn's post an I think a proxy like this does make sense
@_date: 2017-03-03 20:10:10
But then you have to keep digital information safe. I find it much more comforting to trust an envelope with at least waterproof paper (or pressed metal) of the mnemonic in it than to trust a computer. At least when it comes to my end-of-life bitcoin plan.

I definitely think figuring out real data on if miners filling their own blocks with spam is worth doing. The cost isn't zero though. The cost would be the loss of transactions from others. But it feels like there should be some equilibrium when it would benefit the miner. Like maybe if they only did it when the mempool wasn't already full, or was full but only with very cheap transactions? I'm not sure. 
My gut says at least one miner must be trying something like this, but I don't have data to support it. Does anyone? I've asked before and got no reply/was downvoted.  I've seen data on all sorts of other selfish miner attacks.

Correct. Miner block count matters more here than node count but in theory miners should follow the rules of the most popular clients. 
I think old miners will be pretty much guaranteed to mine invalid blocks once segwit activates because a single malicious transaction being in their block would invalidate it and they'll have no way to know if segwit transactions are actually valid or not without upgrading. I hope no assholes spam invalid transactions with segwit outputs, but given all the other foul play in crypto, it seems a given.

How much space does coinjoin save? Joinmarket transactions are definitely larger than standard transactions, not smaller. What am I missing here?
Also, I'm not that impressed by 6x growth on top of 2-3 TPS. Every bit helps, but I think we need orders of magnitude more than that. Hopefully lightning will work well enough that most transactions don't end up on chain. 
I still think 2 or 4MB blocks should have happened years ago and then we could add all the things you've listed as they become production ready. Oh well. 
Also, any source on timestamping standards? That sounds interesting. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 01:52:07
So you don't know enough about the protocol to say if SegWit's increase to 2 MB is dangerous but you do know enough to be sure a hardfork is bad? Seems odd to me. Please explain how you can be sure of one but not the other. 
First, you should look at all the data that people have released about larger blocks such as the stuff Toomim presented at the Hong Kong stalling conference or the paper from Cornell. 
@_date: 2016-11-27 01:45:01
I figured. I have something that is likely doing the opposite. I've noticed a large number of nodes that appear totally fake (subvers that make little sense given the IPs) and so I've been banning them. I'm not sure what their goal is but I think many of them are not listening

Let's try this again


But that is almost Satoshi's exact words. He changed his mind once the network was running, but they are his words and the original idea. 
The white paper has zero mention of ASIC. Can you please include a quote or source from the white paper where the original idea came from? I agree that he did start talking about them in 2009-2010, but this isn't how the word "never" works. 


I didn't say that at all. In fact we are both agreeing that he **changed** his mind on how mining would work. He had no idea that pools would exist in the beginning (his use of the term in the white paper is very different than what we have today) and so bitcoin changed to fit that model. It doesn't mean that the model was "never 1 CPU = 1 vote"
@_date: 2016-11-13 01:49:10
You say Option 3 breaks the Bitcoin security model and I agree. The problem is that miners are doing this today. It's called SPV mining and you can see a couple blocks mined every day with just the coinbase transaction in them that are very likely the result of this.
Do you know if 2, 4, 8, or 20 MB blocks get us to a place where a transaction could cost 10 minutes to validate? Do you know the worst case validation times for those blocks (or even 1 MB blocks). I remember there was a big cleanup transaction that filled almost the entire 1MB before.
I think there is an Option 4 for miners. Accept the block without validation in transaction in it (like many miners already do today) and start validating the block. If there is a high validation cost transaction in the block, switch to Option 2. Why exactly would attempting to orphan a block if you find a transaction that takes more than some factor larger than the median or even the p95/99? That seems like it would actually help prevent the "nightmare" scenario you are describing. I don't understand how you can say for sure that this issue would be exploited gradually. To what end exactly?
And even BU (which I believe is what you are referring to when talking about those who advocate "no limit at all") isn't really no limit. There are still some soft and hard limits designed to prevent a malicious miner like you are describing, so it seems the big blockers do actually have some understanding of the problems here.
@_date: 2016-11-13 02:12:50
If the lone entity is the miner, than they can do this "attack" right now, right? And even if they don't include anyone else's transactions, they are still adding confirmations to the main chain so it isn't completely worthless.
And it isn't cost-free storage if they are a miner. A miner has to spend a lot of money today on hardware and electricity in order to actually find a block. It may be a cost that they don't have to continue paying, but that isn't cost-free.  Do we know what that cost is today? That would be a great number to have to figure out a fee that would keep us safe from this kind of malicious miner.
It seems like if a miner like this were to appear and actually starts causing a real problem, than other miners would figure out a way to orphan their blocks. After all, they are fully validation nodes, too.
Also, there is no need to be condescending and tell me to use Google.

@_date: 2016-11-06 02:45:23
I don't think it was clear what I mean. 
1. Segwit activates with some miners not upgrading
2. Segwit transactions are confirmed in the blockchain
3. Malicious user writes a transaction that uses these anyone can spends that are in the blockchain to confuse old nodes as they don't actually have the ability to spend them 
I don't think it's a big problem for the network because a chain with a transaction like this would be orphaned quickly, but it seems like unupgraded miners won't be too happy 
@_date: 2016-11-18 01:23:12
I agree that it is a sign of support, but it isn't proof of adoption. 
Every time someone posts about how XT/Classic/BU was gaining traction on that node count graph these same arguments are brought up. There's multiple pseudo-client implementations on github that have been out for awhile that can easily spoof any version they want.

They run a LN hub or help the banks that they setup with liquid run hubs and then they get fees that previously went to miners without having to spend energy mining. Way less power to buy coins and run a hub than to mine for coins.

This is nothing new. Pools have always competed to pay miners more. I remember old pools that paid 140% PPS (70BTC equivalent blocks). The whole reason Bitcoin works is that miners are motivated by greed.

I've always wondered if a naughty miner has ever made inefficient transactions and spam to raise the average fee. Part of the time the miner would get the fee anyway if they mine it themselves and so I wonder if there is an amount that makes it profitable to spam.  The larger the hashrate the miner controls, the more possible it is I think. 
@_date: 2016-11-06 17:15:52
Thanks. That's good to hear
@_date: 2016-11-24 18:33:47
Well if they only put their own spam in the block then they aren't going to get paid anything but the block subsidy. Any rise in fees caused by that block being full won't go to them.
I'm wondering if there is a mix of your own spam along with other peoples transactions that would benefit the miner.  I don't think that the supply/demand curves for blockspace are linear and so it seems like this could be possible. 
Maybe I'll do some math later but I was hoping someone else had already thought of this besides OP and me. 
@_date: 2016-12-03 17:36:26
Node count in the early days was way higher because running a node was the easiest way to have a wallet and mine. I personally had over 20 nodes for a short time because I was CPU mining on that many systems. When GPU and then FPGA miners dominated, I stopped doing that. The block size has nothing to do with that decrease in node count.
Now I don't mine and I run 2 nodes and only one of them is open to the Internet. The other is still a fully validating node, it just only has outbound connections.

There doesn't seem to be any way to do this with just bitcoind. 
What you could do is run HAproxy or something like it on port 8333 and then have it setup with a backend to your bitcoin nodes. Then you would add your upgraded node to the backend once it's running, remove the old node, and reload haproxy. From the outside there would be no downtime.

I'm not sure you can have decentralized immutability without the currency. That would be a blockchain without a direct incentive to secure it. Without mining being directly profitable I have a hard time believing a blockchain would survive public mining. 
I trust Bitcoin because I trust miners to be greedy. The greedier they are the more they secure the chain.

All solutions are can kick solutions. No solution will ever exist that will be done once and then allow scaling forever.
Even the LN white paper says it needs 133 MB blocks to support the world population. Ignoring the fact that there are way way more computers than there are people (meaning I think this estimate is low), we have a long way to go to scale and every step that increases transaction throughput needs to be considered.
Also, if we were able to hard fork and everything worked out, then what exactly would be so wrong about opening that door?

Did you read AB129 or just the clickbait headlines? The law that explicitly banned you from making alternative currencies (like bitcoin, second life lindens, store points, etc.) was repealed. AFAIK, there's no California law that says "Bitcoin is formally legalized" whatever that would even mean. 
It also doesn't do anything to change any of the regulations that surround money transmission and money service businesses. 
I think the point of this law is to be able to regulate all the scam Bitcoin wallet websites and poorly built exchanges that lose/steal thousands and thousands of coins every year.  Everyone here clamoring about how the government regulating is a horrible thing don't seem to have a solution for getting back coins lost at Gox or Pirate massive pyramid. The free market doesnt stop those losses.
I haven't yet had time to read all of this article, but sane regulation could give a legal path to help recover stolen funds and stop disreputable businesses that have the capability of stealing or losing customer funds from becoming large in the first place. A bitcoin business built in a way where the customer is always in complete control of their funds (which is how near all Bitcoin services should be built now that people are figuring out multisig) should be exempt from regulation if this law is Sane. From most of the comments here though it seems like no one got past the reddit headline.

The white paper ( page 19 says lightning will need bigger blocks: 




I have a few problems with these numbers:
1. The average transaction size is closer to 600, not 250 bytes. So instead of 24 GB without LN, it should be 2.4x that
2. I'm not sure the average with lightning will be 500 bytes so that will change the LN number too
3. I'm excited for machine-to-machine payments in Bitcoin, but both these calculations use 7 billion **people**. This looks to me like the same mistake that we made that led to IPv4 being far too small. I have at least 5 devices (laptop, desktop, phone, home server, cloud sever) that I can see using payment channels. I also hope Bitcoin will create additional use cases that mean I will have even more devices with their own channels. Assuming all my devices should have a channel open, that brings the max expected up another 5x to support LN. Although expecting the whole planet to use it is also odd. Maybe we should drop that to 3 billion people to match how many people have Internet access?
4. I'm not sure channels will actually last a year

Uber surges to bring more drivers onto the system more than it surges to deter customers. Deterring customers is not a good thing.
In your analogy you are changing the price (transaction fees) but the supply (block size) is fixed. With Uber both the price (surge) and the supply (number of drivers with open seats) are dynamic. 
Blocks should be bigger. 1mb is tiny.

If everyone sends their inputs to a shared address (Ti), then how is this better than one big transaction? Isn't address reuse with a bunch of identically sized inputs and outputs something that would stick out to people analyzing the block chain?

If it's the former, I fail to see how this is more anonymous than coinjoin. Someone could just look for addresses in the block chain that have a bunch of same sized inputs and pretty much know it's coin party as every wallet avoids address reuse and there isn't any real reason to send multiple same sized inputs to the same address besides this mixing strategy that I know of
EDIT: also, doesn't that mean that coinparty isn't really 2 transactions, but 2 transactions per participating node? That's a much bigger number. I still think I prefer the mixing methods that use group transactions if that's the case

No one is saying your second statement. Over and over I see this straw man. A proper way to honestly word what people are saying is "oh no, bitcoin is hurting, the fees are too high and so a lot of people who want to use it have to use something else"

Coins in coinbase's self-managed vault have keys that are controlled primarily by the user and so coinbase doesn't have to do anything special about those since they don't even have the power to move them.
We do need an answer for the other coins on coinbase though.

Cold means never connected to a computer that touches the internet. So no, a USB key is not cold storage unless you have an offline computer too. It is more secure than a wallet on your normal desktop computer though.

I've used that same combination in the past. My concern is that the electrum server could easily connect all my addresses. Is electrum doing anything to hide addresses being connected when requesting balances? Last I checked it wasn't.

Why wouldn't that lead to this exact same situation? We will just have some other ASIC manufacturer able to take the lead.

Regardless of your thoughts on compact blocks, I still wish it was easy to update that paper to match today's nodes. At least mine is far more capable than when they published. I'm sure people have added little raspberry pis, too.
I just want updated data. The 4mb number gets said a lot on both sides and it would be nice to have something that matches today's network better. 
I'm most interested to know how much bandwidth is available.

I hope to not have a single key able to transfer the entirety of my wealth if my coins are worth anything close to Gate's net worth.
Bitcoin doesn't really stop ransoms though. That's a physical world problem that doesn't care if you have crypto or fiat.

You quoted a small portion. The context matters.

So it would be a hard fork with the explicit plan to fork again if ASICs are developed? Or only if the main producer disagrees with some  developers and users?

More miners != more supply. Blocks are still 1MB and about every 10 minutes no matter how many (or few) miners. More miners means more security/difficulty, but not really any more supply.

I'm tired of seeing this. Uber surges price to **attract** drivers, not to reduce demand. Reducing demand is crazy. Once more drivers are on, surge goes away. 
Bitcoin fees do nothing to increase supply. All they do is quash demand.

"Like Bitcoin itself, Coinpunk is 100% open source. If you're a developer, you can add features and improvements and we'll merge them in. If you don't like how we're doing, you can run your own Coinpunk server."

I assume these docker instances are in regtest networks. Can you link to the code to set this up? It sounds like a lot of fun to play with and I've got a server with docker and RAM to spare.
Also, with thousands of nodes, how many coins are being locked up in each channel? The upfront capital costs are my main concern with LN.

In my experience at a large company with employees all over the world, flying around as an engineer has been incredibly helpful for both morale and productivity. Meetings over webcam (especially to another time zone) just aren't as good as face to face meetings.

Very nice, but you should definitely look into using a newer version of openssl rather than the version that comes with OS X.  You will get a noticeable speed improvement (I get ~340Kkey/s on my macbook air).  I don't have much experience with macports, but I'm sure they must have OpenSSL 1.0.0d+




I've also compiled VanityGen on Mac OS X, but I used brew instead of ports. With brew it's just `brew tap WyseNynja/bitcoin &amp;&amp; brew install WyseNynja/bitcoin/vanitygen`
Also, samr7's repo hasn't been updated in months and has some bugs in OSX, so I looked around at all the forks on github and pulled all the interesting/bugfix commits into my own fork at

p2pool has all the network benefits of solo mining with reduced payout variance.  It sounds to me like it's exactly what you want.
You mine on your own local bitcoind, so there is no trust in the pool.  There is no chance of someone using your hashing power to merge-mine attack an alt-coin like Luke-jr did to Coiledcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-29 01:32:47
All coiledcoin did was enable OP_EVAL. It's already in Bitcoin, it's just disabled since it's potentially dangerous. Changing the generation rate and enabling a disabled feature do not make coiledcoin innovative. There are definitely some cool things that can come from OP_EVAL, but more thought should be put into it than just blindly enabling it and releasing a coin.

No proof? It's from early 2016 and crypto and tech in general change fast.  When that paper was written, my node was a 1.8ghz atom with 50kBps available to it. Now it's a 3.0ghz Xeon with 300kBps available to it. So I know at least my node is more capable. 
Also, I remember one of the authors commenting more recently about how the average speeds on the network has already changed a bunch, but now I can't find that

Luke-jr used his pool to merge mine coiledcoin before it had any other big miners and he had far more than 51% of the network. He set his pool to only mine his pool's blocks and reject anyone else's and also required a fee of like 100 coins to accept a transaction. None of his miners were able to tell this was happening because getblocktemplate wasn't a thing yet. It was a jerk move, but he did it to prove that pools needed some transparency and then wrote the code to allow that transparency. Sucks for coiledcoin, but it was just a pump and dump scamcoin anyways and mining of all coins is improved because of it.
