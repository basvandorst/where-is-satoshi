thank you! i confused address and public key, and i was wondering why/how the *exposed* receiving address would be any safer than the address i am spending from.

thanks for the explanation.
@_date: 2019-08-22 14:13:53
any tips on what should i search for?
@_date: 2019-08-22 13:58:56
i am about to receive a btc payment and i need a wallet soon. i don't want to use coinbase and the like.
@_date: 2019-08-22 17:26:52


how do you know that keys a wallet created is actually yours? do people who use spv wallets actually review and understand its codes?


which one?


interesting. i didn't know this is something you could do in bitcoin core.
@_date: 2019-10-09 02:06:53
thank you, i'll try that. is it also possible to run it without connection in an offline system?
@_date: 2019-10-09 02:04:59
thank you!

thank you!

they sure did. these forums are great and many of my questions were answered. regarding hardware wallets, i cannot afford one at the moment and i am also not convinced that they are more secure than a software wallet on an air-gapped system, after all hardware wallets too use someone else's software which has to be trusted for creating private keys, not just managing them, right?

thank you!

could you please check this new related question: 
@_date: 2019-08-26 11:02:12


i though only the download is time consuming. can you turn off and on the device and resume the process?
@_date: 2019-10-09 02:08:49
thank you!
@_date: 2019-08-26 10:10:24




if it is possible to prune blocks, why do i need the initial 200 GB download?
@_date: 2019-10-03 23:29:04
that's not what i asked... but how? it doesn't seem to be possible.
@_date: 2019-08-24 17:32:52
thanks for answering all my noobish questions :)


can you please tell me more about this or tell me where I can read about it. is it not possible for a wallet to create compromised but functional keys that could be reproduced latter by its creator? like having a master key, if that makes sense.


does this converting require a third-party application?


on different systems? does it make sense to create multiple wallets with one application on single system?
i just checked [bitcoin.org]( any ideas why they have listed bitpay but not copay? other than centralized validation, how do you think bitpay compares to electrum?
@_date: 2019-10-03 23:40:47
when i open it, the first thing it asks is to set a location to download and save files. it says it needs 200 something GB free space. how can i skip this?
@_date: 2019-10-09 02:10:03
thank you!
@_date: 2019-08-22 17:31:23


is it compatible with bitcoin core?
@_date: 2019-08-22 16:08:57
bitcoin core user's are more advanced than most spv wallets and its code is reviewed by more people, so it seems easier to trust.
also i hope to be able to set up a full node in the future, and i prefer not to move coins if possible.
@_date: 2019-08-26 10:52:55
my laptop has a one tb hdd so i think i am good for several years, but out of curiosity, is it not possible to move the files from one storage to another? i guess it wouldn't be simple if the disk is encrypted.
@_date: 2019-10-09 01:55:51
thank you!


do you recommend using a linux distro with fewer packages? like [ubuntu mini](


do you mean [like this]( does doing that install the 3.3.8 version or an unreleased version? because it seems many things have [changed]( since 3.3.8.
@_date: 2019-10-09 02:09:40
thank you so much!
@_date: 2019-08-22 13:49:35
i am not familiar with the terminology here. i meant to import the private key (swipe? restore from seed?) so the hd wallet would be fully functional.
i just don't have the resources to use bitcoin core at the moment, but i also don't intend to spend any time soon. so i thought i might be able to set up bitcoin core for now and if i needed to spend, i could use electrum or another spv wallet.
@_date: 2019-10-09 02:04:57
thank you!
@_date: 2019-10-03 23:57:55
thank you, but it seems you misunderstood my question. please go to the links in my original post and see transparency section/column.

thank you, i had no idea about this.
@_date: 2019-09-27 15:43:23


i had no idea about this.
so, for example, when i broadcast a transaction from a multisig r/Electrum wallet, could the recipient or electrum servers know that what kind of wallet i have, standard or multisig?
@_date: 2019-09-27 15:46:37


which observers? other cosigners? tx recipient? in case of spv wallets like r/Electrum, can servers see this too?
