The only problem I'd have with this is the calculations in fractions, given the btc value.  (trading for 0.0001 btc for example) I guess this could be adjusted somehow to make it easier, but I dont know enough about it.

Exactly, it will be interesting. There was a conversation that happened yesterday around the concern of groups in lower economy countries farming on the cheap for less coins than others can afford to do (sound familiar?). But even this has it's bad effects, as their mining efforts go cheap, they increase their risk (the difference between the real world economy and this one when that happens, is in this game you could lead a posse who's job is to take out the undercutting miners, or offer the miners protection for a cut etc etc) it's going to be very interesting.

An unfortunate step. (This is what stops someone registering thousands of blank accounts to vote).

Just a player, not really affiliated but I think I can answer.
I think the question around faster travel etc, will come down to the invention mechanism. A player may invent a certain drive for example that's faster than anything anyone else has come up with. That player could then sell the knowledge, or just keep it for themselves. 
It's asteroidesque, at least the public test is. I think it's safe to assume it will continue this way.

All due respect, someone who works on these type of projects would know that living expenses for a project like this would be far greater, and that amount is a small bump for something this ambitious.
