I'm just a basic bitch. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is not Bitcoin (BTC). They are both 2 different versions of the protocol, but they both exist independently. Saying "both should be bitcoin"... okay they both are technically bitcoin, but they are both 2 independent systems at this point.

I should have put a "/s". Trying to show that even saying "don't buy all at once" is equally a silly thing to advocate due to the fact that no one knows. DCA and spend/replace are my 2 mantras.

24 months!? You gotta pump those numbers up. No joke, I think the 9-year DCA plan is worth the gamble. This time frame encapsulates the upcoming halving and 2 more after it. I hate thinking about waiting that long, but I really believe $100 worth of bitcoin today will be worth $100,000 in 10 years. And we honestly don’t know how high it could go, considering global debt is currently racing toward $150 trillion.

Ledger nano x my man. You won’t regret it. The wallet app ledger live has been great for me as well. It’s worth investing $120 into a hardware wallet if you are sitting on that much bitcoin
@_date: 2019-07-18 11:40:56
For small amounts of Bitcoin, depending on where you live, the cash app isn't a bad option. Also, if you are already using coinbase. If you log into pro.coinbase.com (formerly gdax.com), you can access your bitcoins from your coinbase wallet, and when you move them to another wallet, coinbase will pay the transaction fee. But only if you are doing this from their trading platform, pro.coinbase.com

I was here when it was sub $5. And even then most people were saying it was a fluke at best and a scam at worst. I unfortunately only developed strong hands a couple years ago, so I’m not sitting as pretty as I’d like.

no one would have bought it if it did not have "bitcoin" attached to the name. Roger Ver may be without a moral compass, but he's not dumb. I gotta hand it to the guy. He's pretty fuckin smart, and was on this train WAY before most of us were. To be super fucking honest,  he was the FUCKING MAN way back when. One of the only people putting it out there that BTC is the future. I just think he realized how much money he could sit on if he were to get control of the network. And at this point, I don't even know if he cares to have bitcoin cash take over bitcoin. His coin is currently in the top 5, and I'm sure he's sitting on an ASS load of BCH. lol jesus I hate the guy as much as I use to love him back in the day.
@_date: 2019-07-31 18:10:36
Okay, here's my advice. Go ahead and put $1,000 in (only if losing it won't ruin your life). You will lock down roughly .1 BTC. Many people here believe that in the next 10 years, Bitcoin could be worth MUCH more than it currently is. I believe in the next 20 years, .1 BTC could be enough to retire on. 
Now that you have your .1 BTC, go ahead and pick a fixed number $10, $20, $50, or $100 (depending on what your paychecks look like each pay day). And buy that amount of Bitcoin each paycheck. Dollar Cost Averaging will allow you to slowly accumulate without breaking the bank. 
Your question "Is 10K a good price for BTC". Well, about a year ago you could have gotten almost a third of a bitcoin for $1,000. Hindsight is a bitch, and it's not worth focusing on. Thinking this way could go 2 ways.
 1)You wait, the price goes down to $6,000 just like everyone here said it wouldn't (wouldn't be the first time this Sub didn't correctly call the future). You then buy in and are happy you waited. 
2) You wait, the price spikes to $42,000 early next year, and you're $1,000 will get you 1/4th of the Bitcoin that you could have gotten at $10,000. 
It's all up to you, and you should do your own research. If you are interested in buying in, but are hesitant, you should do more research to build the confidence in your decision. There are a lot of people that don't believe in this blockchain shit or it's ability to transform the future. 
There's a popular Chinese proverb that says: “The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.” This is how I feel about bitcoin. In 20 years, you may look back thinking "shoulda woulda coulda". No one knows for sure, and I'm willing to gamble money I'd normally spend on booze, cigarettes and eating out (food you pervs), for the possibility of financial sovereignty in the future.

What's really wild is I keep hearing politicians say shit like "If you want blah blah blah changed, go tell the legislature". In order to play ball, everyone has to play by the rules, and the government is so apathetic and complacent that they would rather wait for a revolt from it's citizenry than be proactive about changing the rules. The way these politicians were talking about bitcoin had me hopeful though. Facebook is just another company and they have to play by the same rules that all American companies play by. Bitcoin, being decentralized, inherently CANNOT adhere to these standards. These politicians seem to be aware of this, and don't seem interested in stopping it. That is incredible shit.

I'm fine with it being here, it's just sickening how Ver and everyone else get to claim "this is Bitcoin (bch)" and NOT "this is bitcoin cash (bch)". He does this because BTC is open sourced, and there is no one to defend the system from this type of abuse. If you want me to be honest, it would have happened sooner or later. A corrupt attack to subvert the network by a few (evil) key players. If Bitcoin can't survive bcash, it doesn't deserve to live.

I've never seen it before, but there, I'll leave a comment, someone will reply with an insult, and when I try to comment back I get a message that says "you are doing this too much" literally after one comment lol. And then the person who just cracked the insult has their comment at +10 before I can get my reply back. Part me of me thinks this is a strategy, and they hope that people just say "fuck it, i'm not waiting 10 minutes". And when people are looking at the conversation it just looks like an overwhelming majority of people agreed with the insult, and the person never came back to defend themselves, so they must have just left out of shame.

For sure. My limited understanding is that the block size limit will be increased AFTER as much efficiency has been packed into the current system. That way,when increasing the block size becomes necessary, it will have a compounding effect due to all of the efficiencies previously implemented.

No one is guaranteeing there is a return. But statistically speaking, every market cycle, bitcoin is worth orders of magnitude more than it was before. Many people that day trade are not experts and do loser their money. Out of everyone I have known to trade, only 1 person is still in the positive, and barely just. You can say "but $10 worth of BTC just isn't much, and holding it won't get me anywhere". In 10 years that $10 worth of BTC could be worth $10,000.

Yep, and it’s amazing how quickly the time comes when you realize that the $25-$50 you’ve put into BTC each paycheck is now something quite substantial, outperforming every other investment vehicle available to me. I didn’t do much of anything and now I’m (technically according to some) over invested in btc with the heights it’s reached compared to things like my Roth or 401k. I’m not interested in spreading the btc gains among my other investments. Will just keep watching it in disbelief. Hopefully in 5-10 years I’ll be able to just live my life and work how and when I want (my idea of retirement).

I've used it once, turned it off, and then weeks later turned it back on to mostly full battery. There have been times when I was using it pretty heavily and the battery seemed to drain fairly quickly. If I had to guess, I'd say the battery could like around a few hours of continuous use.

People still don’t get the power of bitcoin. In the near future, retirement portfolios will be putting a percent of their 401ks into a bitcoin backed fund that is partially matched by their employer. They will be dollar cost averaging in, every paycheck. When governments start hedging their bets, and start mandating that a portion of their yearly taxed money will go to buying BTC and storing it as a reserve. It will be economic suicide to not participate.

I had both for a while, ended up keeping the ledger due to it supporting XRP but the trezor didn’t. Idk if the trezor still doesn’t, but that was the reason I went with the ledger nano s and never looked back. Getting the X soon and I’m pumped. I’ve been in this space forever and can’t believe a device like the nano x exists and functions with an app on your smart phone.

$1 in Bitcoin absolutely could be worth $1000 in 12 years. Like many, I believe we are still quite early and no one really knows the potential price. I feel bad because you are too young to have had the holding experience some of us have. If you can learn it this young, you will retire early. Just hold, and invest elsewhere and hold that too! (Property, Roth IRA, 401k). It took me until almost 30 to start playing smart. If you do it at 18, early retirement is not just attainable, but highly likely!

What an odd thing, out of ALL THE THINGS, to come in here and whine about. 
I love stacking sats btw. Keeps it all in perspective. Also, just so you know, I’ve been thinking “I told you so” for quite some time now. I never say it though, because that’s something for assholes like you to say ;)
@_date: 2019-12-13 13:10:58
eh, i'm good. I'll just keep holding. I wouldn't have the stack I have now if I were aggressively spending it and replacing it just for the sake of it. So i'll just continue to stack.
@_date: 2019-12-03 04:59:56
“Let’s not hand it over to millionaires”. You do realize bitcoin is decentralized right? No one can stop the wealthy from participating. No one can stop the banks and FIs from participating. No matter how much your panties are bunching, it’s just how it is. And no other decentralized crypto is beyond that either. 
So what are you even flippin talking about?
@_date: 2019-06-26 14:25:53
It honestly makes me feel bad to have hands this strong at this price range. If it hits $200,000, I'll be hard pressed not to sell it all, pay my taxes, pay off EVERYTHING (house, cars, debt).
@_date: 2019-12-13 13:20:45
Stacking and holding does nothing? lol. As opposed to what? Spending when you don't have the money to replace just because some goober on reddit told me to? 
Again.. I'm good. You do you dog, and I'll do me. That's what makes a decentralized currency so awesome. I can use it however way I wish. No matter how sad it makes a goober like you!

I don’t though. I’ve been slowly buying in what I can afford. But back then I had several mining rigs with 6950s mining a handful of btc a day at the beginning. I probably had anywhere from 150-200 btc pass through my possession. There was a point where I was putting 1 btc on a laminated paper wallet to save for family and friend. But it turned out I needed to sell to keep my life on track. It sucks to think about now, but I’m in the camp that believes that even .1 btc could mean an early retirement in the next 10 years.

I had both too! What cracks me up is when I finally convinced my friend to buy some BTC I was so excited I just gave him my trezor. Been really eyeing the nano X lately though. From what I’ve read it’s essentially the same security with increased convenience which I’m all for.

Jeez man, inside voice lol. "The timeline on all this shit is way longer than any of you kids that witnessed 2017 understand." Don't act like you know the timeline either. None of us do. If it hit $100,000 tomorrow youd probably leave a comment to us "kids" saying "Learn a fucking timeline, I knew this was going to happen, GET THE FUCK OUT AND STOP TALKING ABOUT THE PRICE". You are ridiculous to think that your comment made any impact on people talking about price, so maybe your best bet, if you don't like seeing all the price talk, is to get the fuck out of here?

People are ridiculous. Tell you to buy at $19,500 but say it’s going to $0 when it’s at $3200. They don’t even look at previous market cycles. I know past performance is not indicative of future results but damn. I remember when it broke $20 the first fucking time. And now some goober that started paying attention to CNN talking about crypto’s last week is saying it’s going to $0. Give me a break. My family is like this, and it’s something I use as an indicator myself. When my family says buy, I know I should sell. And when they say “I knew it was a scam” I just buy some more.

My wife and I went to Vegas for a weekend trip. We go to in and out to buy some food and a t-shirt. Card gets locked because they said we didn’t call them to tell them we’d be in Vegas. Okay fine. I call them and it’s unlocked in 5 minutes. A year later and My wife and I were on a family trip in mexico when my card was ran for $750 by a thief. All transactions went through, even 5 in a row for $125 back to back. They told me I’d have to get in touch with their fraud department. Last month I was told I wouldn’t be getting my money back. I asked them why they would freeze my card in Vegas but not Mexico, and all I was told was “I understand you’re frustrated, we are looking into this”

I agree with you. Everyone saying "any day now" would do better to just to forget about it. Right now, my earliest pull out year is 2028 (if I can keep my hands strong).

@_date: 2018-11-20 11:49:38
I see it mentioned all the time, but when the price drops the advice just disappears. If you believe in Bitcoin longterm, then DCA is your best friend. Especially in times like this. For me it's about $50 a month ($25 a paycheck). I'm digging the lowered prices, and wouldn't be upset to see them go even lower. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 13:53:14
My first time seriously quitting was this way. Use to be a pack a day smoker for about $5 a pack. Decided that I would put $35 in bitcoin a week instead. It adds up. If you have the will power and patience you will be surprised how much money you were throwing away on cigarettes. 
@_date: 2018-11-02 20:25:15

Same. There were several times where my room mate and I were both putting up 35 to 40 bitcoins a piece to buy shit off of the OG Silk Road. 
@_date: 2019-01-28 22:26:30
man, I bought a little when it hit $1200 the first time, and then the price slowly fell to $200. It was a big loss for me. And it was slow, and it sucked. Everyone I was bragging too when it hit $1200 were rubbing it in my face. Everyone that was talking shit about bitcoin then wanted to know how to buy it when it was at $19,000. Now we are back at another low, and everyone is sad, or saying "I told you so". And I'm just buying $50 worth every paycheck thinking it's gonna ramp back up to another crazy ATH one of these days. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 19:39:39

I agree we are better prepared, but I still think the numbers we previously saw, will be nothing compared to whats to come. I'm not saying this will DEFINITELY happen, but I've thought about banks, and big FIs opening up large lightning wallets, and charging a premium to convert cash in their existing customers accounts to bitcoin, through an interface they control. They would make some bullshit charge card, that would actually sign transactions on updated credit card machines, linked to the lightning network. And then charge as much maintenance fee's as they would a bank account. It sounds fucking insane, but I honestly think there is a big opportunity for banks to make a fortune off of a bitcoin run as well.

You can say that, but until you have a friend or family member say "I finally bought that bitcoin thing you've been talking about, a whole one!". I'm not going to say I see it every day, but I've been talking about this shit with people for years. And I've seen it happen a few times. 
You do realize that once a week we see scams posted here that say "Give me 0.1 BTC and I'll give you 1.0BTC in return, it's easy!"? 
And I agree, if it's too good to be true, people should be skeptical and figure out what's going on. You can call them ignorant until you are blue in the face, it doesn't matter. Those people still exist. And the ones I know went to bitcoin.com. 
I even said "why would you go there? Would you go to tv.com if you were trying to buy a tv?!", but shit, that doesn't make anyone feel any better. All you can do is say "well... do you want to keep the bch? and just buy the real stuff? Or sell the BCH for the real stuff?"
And then to have friends say "I've seen people say online that Bitcoin Cash IS Bitcoin". Then you find out that they have been going to r/btc lol. The struggle is real for some people. I just try to keep the people I know and care about informed.

Now I get to hear my dad bitch about how “it just doesn’t make sense that it went back up”. And now he’s hell bent on not buying until it’s back to $3,000. I guess we’ll see how that pans out

It’s amazing to me that the people I personally know with the strongest opinions hold no coins. The next set of strong opinions come from friends who lose money day trading (I know they lose because they tell me). Then there are people like me that only hold. With no strong opinion one way or the other outside of just buy and hold. I have my current position looking much better before the halving than I did last time, so I have that goin for me I guess.

I was mind fucked when an old friend told me “you must be rich now, I bought 50 eth 100 Ltc, and 10 btc after we talked a few years back! What do you have”. At that point I was about to throw up on my friend because all of my bitcoin was sold a year before to get my life sorted lol. Most guy wrenching Waffle House run in I’ve had to date. Fuuuuuuuuuuuu.

If that’s how it looks, than it most likely is too good to be true. No joke, that gut feeling will save you so much time and energy. Eventually you’ll stop giving a damn about pipe dream offers from these mining contracts and will realize that nothing is stronger than just buying and holding securely off of an exchange. Even if the amount seems insignificant now. It’s still yours, and you control it.

Sometimes y’all are able to do well, but that right there is what keeps me from trading. I’ve been burned a couple times and would rather just buy and hold. Treat it like a 401k that I won’t even think about touching for at least another 10 years.
@_date: 2018-12-12 13:38:48
If $1 goes up %100, it is now $2. If that $2 goes up %1000, you have $20. If that $20 goes down to $0, you have lost %100. You didn't lose %1200 because that doesn't make sense. Get it?
@_date: 2018-12-05 11:43:24
Bored is a good way to put it. I too have been around since 2011, unfortunately for me, I never had strong hands. I remember saying "i'll ALWAYS hold onto these 50 BTC" then it was "I won't sell this last 20 BTC". Then I had 0 BTC for a while. Bought 10 when the price was around 200-300. Eventually sold all those when I got married and bought a house. I'm now back up to JUST OVER 1 BTC. I just want to retire, lock myself in my home studio, and record awful music until i'm dead

I had always wondered how big the list of words was. 2048. So if we are going on 24 word seeds, the chances of finding someone elses seed randomly is (2048)^24 right? or 1 / 2,048,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000

heck yea, thanks!! Honestly, I feel crazy saying it, but I think even owning .1 BTC could be very significant in the future. My friends said they were waiting for a crash to buy in cheaper than 5 figures.. well .. here we are. Only one of them is buying. Everyone else is saying "why would I buy that?! It's crashing"

Well... I guess you could just go to an exchange, and see how much someone else is willing to sell you one for. And if you refuse, believing that it "shouldn't be that expensive", that's fine. There is someone else paying that amount.

I've heard that quantum computing could eventually destroy the elliptic curve cryptography that Bitcoin utilizes. I've seen people say that it shouldn't be a problem, because the code can be adapted, but that stuff just goes too far over my head for me to say for certain whether its true or not.
@_date: 2019-05-07 17:11:36

ah, forgot to add the "1/" before the (2048)^24. Gotcha. How small would the base amount of available words need to be before we would start to be concerned about finding an address with some coin in it?
@_date: 2019-05-04 16:13:32
Yeaaa. So I preach bitcoin to close friends and family. If the price hits a certain point, when people say “you must be rich!” I’m going to say “I sold too early and didn’t see the rise, I was only able to pay my car off! Dang!!” And then just keep it a secret that I have anything. Hopefully this works, and no one comes at my knees with a fuckin wrench.
@_date: 2019-05-29 11:00:29
Have you looked into XRP? It’s faster and cheaper than BCH. But people here aren’t interested in those crypto’s (should be obvious, this is r/bitcoin).

so when it hits roughly $150,000, swap your holdings into a stable coin, and then buy back in at $50,000. Got it.
@_date: 2019-05-28 12:57:12
The intrinsic value is in the security, and decentralized nature of the system. It's immutable. No one can stop you from moving numbers from your address to someone else's address. On top of that, it is IMPOSSIBLE for you to fraudulently create new numbers and send them to people. "Intrinsic value is the perceived or calculated value of an asset". For me the intrinsic value of Bitcoin comes from everything that I listed.

I think it will be interesting when people start having access to things like the Forbes FB10 list as a type 401k opportunity. If people start putting a fraction of their retirement into something like that as a diversification strategy, there will be constant demand on a limited supply.
@_date: 2018-12-07 18:59:34
I know you were asking for expert advice, but I'm no expert. I have been in the space for a very long time. It was brave of you to drop that kind of cash when the price was literally flying out of control. Like I told a friend earlier. We are at an %85 crash from the last ATH. I know hindsight is a bitch, but for most people (not me, I Dollar Cost Average and buy in the same amount every paycheck) the game is Buy Low and Sell High. Historically speaking, around now would be a decent time to invest (I HIGHLY RECOMMEND DOLLAR COST AVERAGING AN AMOUNT YOU ARE COMFORTABLE WITH). I use to smoke cigarettes and eat out at fast food joints several times a week. I no longer do that, and instead put that money into BTC. Sorry to wait until the end to answer your question, but like the top comment said. How bad do you need that $150? 
@_date: 2018-12-21 12:58:47
Man, is that a periphery enthusiast throwing out lightning tips in r/bitcoin?!
@_date: 2018-12-24 22:21:56
That’s my thought. Lowered my DCA amount and am looking forward to the market declining a bit. Just started the 401k last year. Getting started on a down swing is a good thing to me. Just as log as it’s not all mad max and the thunderdome between now and my retirement

Lmao I just noticed my phone autocorrects jihan wu to johanson. Weird. I don’t believe they do. They are only interested in positioning themselves into a spot of power and wealth by manipulating Bitcoin with a hard fork. But if you like it, buy away! I just don’t think you’ll have much luck convincing anyone here about why they should listen to you.
@_date: 2018-12-22 01:53:20
Hell yea to getting in! Want some advice? Don’t let a single subreddit decide for you what you should invest in. This place is an echo chamber (and that’s not necessarily that bad a thing). what is best for you to do, is research independently and then make a decision. The best advice though is dollar cost averaging!

Reverse what's lost awake the song within you
Rejoice aloud Let these words imbue
Shape the future

Give them hell for existence
Pouring blood on the path they've set in stone,
As we reclaim our position to the throne
Yes, we reduce them all to bones!”

Now we are treading in unknown waters. As of right now, the federal banks around the world are just printing more and more fiat. Inflation, by nature, occurs in the current system. I'm VERY curious as to what will happen with something like BTC, which has a finite supply, making it deflationary by nature.. IMO, as long as BTC is being compared to the USD, and as long as the USD is being printed to infinity, BTC will ALWAYS grow in value. Berkshire Hathway A is currently worth $303,300.00. I don't hear anyone question it. It is my belief that Bitcoin will, over a long enough period of time, will make that look like chump change.
@_date: 2019-05-24 18:15:21
Could be! I too think it will go up, but if you are trying to "time the market", at some point it will catch up to you and you will have a bad time.

You sarcastic rude ass! Lol
@_date: 2019-05-28 12:14:29
lol. Maaaaaan. Time in the market &gt; timing the market. DCA is the best strategy. BUT, I do think now is a good time to invest OVERALL. I think in the next few years the price will be well above it's past ATH. At the same time, the price is past doubled in the last few months. So someone trying to time the market may look at this and say "it's up too much too soon, it HAS to come back down". I don't like playing that game, so I just put $50-$100 every paycheck in, and just forget about it.
