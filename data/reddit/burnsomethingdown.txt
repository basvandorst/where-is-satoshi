So many reasons it's hard to pick one or a few. Whistleblowers are now enemies of the state, at level with treason and terrorism. There is no one a whistleblower can turn to inside this system. Trayvon, the people who actually told the truth were fired and received death threats. The shadow government the NSA operates inside. The Pentagon's accounting. Christopher Dorner. MKULTRA's product The Unabomber. The taliban &amp; Al-Qaeda CIA product. The massive renig on september 11th 2001, and subsequent strong-arming of the middle east. The president of the united states reinterpreting law how and whenever he sees fit. Clinton's treason. Bush's not-war on iraq. The mad arab. russian intel on the boston bombers.
humans can no longer handle the mess we have created.

it's the only way we are going to get out of this without burning the land, air and sea.

Well, the idea of writing updates to remove exploits and flaws in the code is one. As well as the idea of keeping to best coding practices. Commenting code so it's legible to humans. But the best reason, there only needs to be one interpreter.

At baseline I believe they would be better at it. Since we now have politicians writing laws with exploits embedded in them. 
It's exactly like everything else, doctors/mechanics/teachers/scientists/employees a whole bunch of them are shitty, that's why you seek out and hire the good ones.
It's like if you needed a psychic and for whatever reason, you believed in that. You wouldn't just pick up a phone book and expect whichever one your finger hits is the one that's going to tell you where your gold is. You do your research. Just like, you wouldn't take your car to a mechanic that has 99% bad reviews and you wouldn't trust a dentist to give you a cock transplant.

It's the nature of the beast. People who are drawn to bitcoin are already or will become scammers. It's just how it works. Humans naturally destroy everything they touch.

He had made multiple stash spots/safehouse type places in tokyo and other places in case things went sour.
This is partially why he was doing the travelling that pissed everyone off, he was going around collecting the cold storage.

The fact you were downvoted to the point your post was hidden declares absolute proof of the collective delusion these bitcoiner's share.
