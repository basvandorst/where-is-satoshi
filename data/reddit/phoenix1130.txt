There was a story last year of people counterfeiting gold. They do that by making a gold bar with gold in it but with high impurities and then selling it as 99.9% pure gold. The only people who noticed were jewellers who actually melted it down to work it.

No idea. I guess you could say first one with an office there then.  They did a job of hyping themselves up which is probably why they are on the sign more then anything.

It’s the first “British” crypto. That’s probably why it is accepted.

If you use Authenticator you need your old phone at least for iPhone and update all the accounts manually. It’s a pain but very secure.

Cash to btc ? Seems to be untraceable

They probably have a scanner that tracks back x number of transactions and looks for wallets they have blacklisted. It’s probably a pretty automated thing that they can point to if the government came around and said hey look we are doing it. Then they ignore everything else.

If bitcoin hit that alt coins would be worth much more but still lag behind it significantly. It will be interesting to see how Bitcoins role in the crypto market evolves. It is clearly the leader now and if it hit 1 million it would mean that bitcoin stays entrenched as the top coin in the crypto world. My personal opinion is for this to happen bitcoin will need to establish a use beyond speculative investment. As crypto markets mature in general  coins that have no use other then speculation will start to die off. (Probably years away still) So if btc hits a million many alt coins will probably be worth roughly what they are worth today these are ones that haven’t been able to establish wide adoption and have no real use. A select few will be able to establish a foothold in the wider market or have a compelling use these will be the coins that will appreciate with btc. That being said if btc ever hits 1 million I think it will be as much because of the depreciation of the USD as it is the appreciation of bitcoin .
