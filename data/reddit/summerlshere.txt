yes please, can I have a link to those videos ?!
@_date: 2019-07-06 07:21:44
I actually can't move outside of Iran  
@_date: 2018-09-09 22:00:29
We'll try our best to be a part of that circle. As a long time freelancer, I myself have understood that the best way for us to earn bitcoin is to offer services with bitcoin. Big institutions and Corps are deeply involved with fiat, they won't be the ones who start accepting bitcoin. It will start with us.

great. when Arabic ?

@_date: 2018-09-09 21:54:21
Thanks for the suggestion. we'd definitely do that.

That's some extra level opsec :) but I agree, I myself do that sometimes. I even ask a higher price for altcoins then shapeshift them to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-05 12:32:36
Cool, I wish more people like you would share their experience here. It would really help me

Hi, I'm trying to do something similar here in Iran. It's meant to sell goods to foreigners.
@_date: 2018-05-23 10:01:27
Iranian enamel (meenakari) pottery - dried goods - clothes - sweets - books - saffron - Termeh - etc... the list goes on and it includes all Iran-brewed stuff that people from abroad may want to buy. This has significance cuz the annual salary for a moderate person here is about 4000 usd so we can make much more by selling stuff to foreigners.
@_date: 2019-03-09 20:54:11
One thing that comes to my mind as an Iranian is that we here and other countries which suffer from inflation like Venezuela, (which are also heavy on censorship and to make it worse, even cut off from the financial world and in need of Bitcoin), buying the cheapest of computers would take at least 1 or 2 months of income! so, you could think of this as another reason for not being able to run full nodes!
@_date: 2018-10-01 15:33:56
I can confirm what u/iVah1d says. another Iranian here :)  
 I explained this to twitter users before  
@_date: 2018-10-01 15:27:28
yea exactly, I explained this before for twitter users
@_date: 2018-10-01 15:26:52
check this explanation from an Iranian bitcoiner 
@_date: 2018-06-16 12:09:52
WoW that looks like a Trezor =))

Most Internet services are BLOCKED for us (Iranians) both by Iran government/US sanctions. I mean like EVERYTHING ON THE WEB. besides hodling, I use Bitcoin to pay for vpn/vps/domain registering and also a lot of other stuff. I'll benefit from lightning for micro transactions..+ there's some good tech (for future) going on with lightning. [the case of censorship for me is not like yours. we are excluded from the world. I use bitcoin (and any tech related to it in the future) to pay for the VPN that let's me use Reddit to give u this answer]
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:20:24
yep I can. but how do u recommend I send it?
@_date: 2018-06-16 12:07:09
they take the money out of your pocket. no ICO can beat that.

DC or AC, which one's the true vision?
@_date: 2018-06-14 19:30:24
Agreed. Let's put all that energy in building
@_date: 2018-06-14 19:36:11
A True Hodler After the 4th crash, should Buidling too.
@_date: 2018-06-14 19:34:48
since you're hodling, I suggest we put time/energy in Buidling ;-)
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:36:02
I'm from Iran (inflation, censorship). Anything that helps me use bitcoin instead of fiat benefits me. I don't care about the rest of people ;-)
@_date: 2018-06-16 12:10:32
go search for Fiat money. it looks the same
@_date: 2018-06-15 10:01:39

How many days did it take him to roll out code?
@_date: 2018-06-14 19:30:00
He's great for motivating people. We should ask him to do videos explaining bitcoin to people!

Are u insane?! [Iranian here]
@_date: 2018-11-13 21:20:55
Yes. But note that the central bank of Iran issued a ban on Bitcoin for Banks and financial institutions in Iran, about 6 months ago. This was very odd, cuz such institutions haven't been using Bitcoin in the first place. This made us think that there may have been some use by Banks and that's why the CBI declared such a ban. [Iranian here]
@_date: 2018-03-03 13:07:37
btw, What's the name of that blockexplorer?
@_date: 2018-11-13 21:35:58
If u call a guy who's banned from exiting Iran just cuz he's not willing to do the gov's mandatory military service a fake person then you're right !
It seems that imprisoning innocent people is not a dictatorial behavior.. right?!
@_date: 2018-03-12 08:47:57
How did u know that I'm from Iran ��
@_date: 2018-03-12 08:38:25
yes, I'm reachable in the "join the network", 13 connections, 0.16 Bitcoin Core. However, I still don't see myself on the map. I guess that map is updated every once in a while, so let's give it time
@_date: 2019-01-30 09:56:19
Yes it's true.. But not that easy.. actually the rate is a bit higher of u want to scale to more than 1-2 MW
@_date: 2018-03-11 16:38:59
I enabled "Map port using UPnP" and now I'm getting about 13 peers and it's reachable, However, I still don't see myself on the live map. I think there are many nodes like that because I see 7 nodes from Iran but 3 are shown on the map.
@_date: 2019-01-30 10:13:58
I am.
@_date: 2019-01-30 10:02:32
Yes. The price would be a bit less than 2 cents..
And you could see me, and an 8MW farm in this new York times article ;-)
@_date: 2019-01-30 10:00:40
That's me in the pic :))
@_date: 2018-11-14 05:15:32
No ! Almost all of the Bitcoin exchanges in Iran still work. And they don't have ANY problems with their bank accounts. The ban declared explicitly that Banks should not use Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-11 16:39:22
thanks for your help,

@_date: 2019-01-31 10:52:59

Thanks for the nice words..We'll be happy to have you here 
@_date: 2018-03-11 20:00:04
where's this "join the network"? and yes bitcoin core, 0.16
@_date: 2019-01-30 15:59:55
Tell me about it..
That's why we launched Iranbybit.com too.. we accept Bitcoin for issuing credit cards which give u the same functionalities as my own bank card here in Iran.
@_date: 2018-02-19 14:30:25

I already run 6 full nodes 0.15.1 / two of which are locally on my pc and my laptop - and I'm encouraging everyone around me to run their own nodes
