This seems like an unnecessarily rancorous post. They're reasonable questions and I can't help but notice that you do nothing but attack OPs background without contributing anything to the discussion.
You don't have to be a fire marshall to see a building on fire and understand what that means.

I suppose it isn't actually the most appropriate analogy but regardless there are problems down that pike that need to get solved and it doesn't take a specialist or a genius to recognize that; some basic reasoning and common sense will tell you that it doesn't make sense to keep a couple thousand full copies of any database.

Why are you browsing the internet on a machine with your live wallet in the first place.

Like guys I like Bitcoin too but this is just insane. Can't we just say that some energy wastage is an acceptable side effect of the advantages Bitcoin brings without trying to convince ourselves it's actually a good thing?

Yet again we have someone using a clickbaity title to make insanely optimistic predictions about blockchain technology being applied to industries it has no real application in. Games like Cryptokitties are only interesting because it's a novelty that they're on a blockchain in the first place.
Most of these suggestions are just pleas for greater transparency, accessibility, and accountability from games studios. There's no reason why a new technology is needed for any of these things. 


Nothing is stopping them from implementing this now without using a blockchain. Traditional storage engines are much cheaper and faster.


Same argument applies. If they wanted to allow importing of characters from other games it'd be easier to do without getting a blockchain involved and there is just no incentive for them to do so. Silly article.
