READ! What if they are the current tide?

Haven't you checked out the new model yet? It's called RaiBlocks XRB. Don't get me wrong, I'm a true BTC hodler and believer, but let's not be delusional. For the sake of an argument, try transacting in XRB just once.
Learn to face the truth, I know I'm be flamed for this :(

Bitmex doesn't have any volume. Are you really comparing bitmex and CBOE/CME?
Cmon I think we're now just underestimating the effect of wall st jumping onto this train

Law? What law are you taking about when dumping in an unregulated market? You really think they care?
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:12:04
Bitcoin being so volatile is the very reason they'd want to and be able to do this, no?
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:06:35
I'm talking about hedge funds which are for accredited investors only. Cmon, let's be realistic and not delusional. These hedge finds literally invest into "art", what makes you think they can't in bitcoin?

What are you talking? Bill Gates and Richard Branson won't be using all of their money to bet on or against bitcoin. Why do you think Winklevoss wouldn't do it themselves?
"Just because someone makes a lot they're 95% likely to be bearish or want to destroy it? That's silly."
-No they have tremendous upside to try to destroy it, no? They can make more money by destroying. Do you really think these hedge funds care about the tech or want to make money by HODLing like you and I?
You may be 100% correct, all I'm saying is that when they have pockets deep enough to swing the price in their favor and deepen their pockets even more in the future, why wouldn't they?

Who others with billions? You mean you and me and redditors? Cmon man, let's be realistic here. Their fucking executive salaries are more than what we'd EVER make and good enough to cause fluctuations in a $200 bn market.

I hope you're correct and we, believers, win at the end :)
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:37:41
Thank you, that's a very interesting angle :)
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:52:36
I bitgasmed when you called our bitcoin "she"!!!
I hope we all bitgasm when wall st. mourns :D
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:47:02
Hell yes, I agree! And even hope that they burn and the power comes back into the hands of the people :)
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:44:47
I agree with you comments for the long term. But short term can't they manipulate everything?

Yes you are right, someone has to open the long. I can't fingure who that may be in my tiny puzzle.
And the dump loss is taken by us and them. But their net loss/profit from the dump would be minisicule compared to what they could potentially make from shorting. Like Trump says "BILLIONS", no?

1. By storing it offline, doesn't it lose all the properties of being a "cryptocurrency"?
2. Even though I store it perfectly well offline, the minute I want to move/transact it, I have to take it back online right? What of that device is already infected??
Thanks for the advice but that doesn't answer my question :)
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:24:15
Ok I agree with the above.
But don't you think such a system (like in my question) would give the users more confidence to invest in and transact in? How many people can realistically do what you mentioned above? Yes everybody when crypto is used as a "store of value", but when a currency?? Wouldn't it be inconvenient?
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:45:15
I feel so dumb :|

"...old fart set in new ways" lmfao ����
@_date: 2017-10-27 05:02:55
Agreed! But you still need the fiat onramp atleast till Bitcoin is wholly adopted and accepted for goods and services, right? Am I missing something?
@_date: 2017-10-27 05:01:13
Thanks a ton for your detailed answers.
But, for the unbanked to trade entirely in bitcoin, we still need adoption, right? Otherwise nobody would accept bitcoin for godds and services. But yes, I get your point. Thanks again :)

ATMs? Really? ��
It's actually a great idea! By the time he cashes out, we'll see 1 BTC = $10,000
