KYC nazis, almost impossible to get verified with them as an American. They above the legal mandate to validate US information so I think they only care about EU customers.
No ACH support either.

There are already many many nodes in EU....Yes geography makes a difference because we want them to be as spaced out as possible (resilience). SA probably has very few nodes so it is proffered and more beneficial for the network if you kept yours there instead of migrating it to the EU.

I am not surprised at all...Like many of us have said, Gemini are KYC NAZIS!!
They did this to me too and STILL refused to verify my account. They go ABOVE AND BEYOND THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS to get client information....Why? Nobody knows....Stay away from them if you value your privacy at all.
@_date: 2017-03-21 16:28:54
You are lucky they asked you anything....The app is basically useless. I have a verified US Bank account linked that was previously working fine for smaller amounts. I did 1 $500 USD deposit and it got blocked, and now they are;
1) Not telling me why it got blocked (got the money on the account)
2) Cannot cancel it within the app (still shows as pending)
3) All future deposits are blocked as well (probably they said)
WTF Abra...So soon after launch, yet so many problems....Tried 1 transaction and I bricked my entire account...Useless app tbh

Very cool! What bar? :)

Unfortunately there is likely nothing you can do....Many many of us have similar issues. Gemini are KYC nazis and require way more information than coinbase even. For example, sometimes they actually verify proof of employment (call your boss) and in my case, they blocked my registration completely because my cell number is not with one of the big 3 providers....
@_date: 2017-03-10 12:10:46
Just tried it and it is bullshit....
1) $500 ACH daily limit
2) You have no idea what the rate is in advance....And that is by design!!! That is crazy, but it is true (just confirmed by support). You send them $500 today and 2-3 days later when they receive the funds, THEN you find out what the BTC rate will be, and only then.
Are they mad? All their competitors do it at the spot rate when purchasing, not transferring funds!!!
@_date: 2017-01-22 14:30:45
Their USD exchange is unaffected FYI and still provides a rebate actually.
@_date: 2017-01-18 16:52:06
A little of a confusing model, even for me....
I understand I can fund my app/account with them with USD from my US bank account via ACH.....But what then? Can I convert that to BTC directly within the app and then transfer the BTC out or no? Can I meet with another Abra user who has BTC in their app and make a BTC for USD trade within the app?
Do I have to meet with them personally or can we handle the trade remotely?
@_date: 2017-01-22 14:27:00
USD funding options?
@_date: 2017-01-16 22:50:59
What are the funding options from USD?
I have USD in a US bank account for example.
@_date: 2017-01-07 00:31:33
NO, they are KYC nazis!!! They go ABOVE the legal requirements, do NOT support a company like this!!
You cannot even sign up with them if you aren't with 1 of the 4 major carriers (like me).....They automatically reject your number.
@_date: 2017-01-08 18:37:34
How do we report this to Apple?
@_date: 2017-01-20 11:04:25
Similar experience....You are lucky you got even that far. They basically wanted a DNA sample from me to open an account....KYC nazis with horrible support and pricing, no thank you....
@_date: 2017-01-25 18:20:38
Horribly slow support....Sometimes it takes their non existent support team 8-10 business days to simply reply to a ticket.
@_date: 2017-01-08 16:52:55
Horrible KYC nazis....
I am from a supported state and yet still can't sign up because they go above and beyond the legal requirements to verify their customers.......If you don't have a phone number from one of the big 3/4 carriers, you can't even  use their service.....
Fucking BS
@_date: 2017-01-25 20:13:42
I always get same day responses from Coinbase and Kraken....Uphold ALWAYS takes days to respond. The record so far on 1 ticket has been 10 days...Many other 8 day or more recently (as of today) a 5 day old ticket that has yet to receive a single reply.
@_date: 2017-01-25 18:22:27
Then don't use a service that is run by liars? Even if it does financially hurt them....
@_date: 2017-01-03 18:52:11
+1, Kraken is a horrible platform who goes above and beyond AML/KYC legal requirements....Why would any company go above and beyond the government requirements is beyond me but they do and are proud of it...
I still have have money trapped on there that they refuse to release....They WILL take your money, stay away!!
@_date: 2017-01-18 20:25:05
Are they planning to release the USD-&gt;BTC feature soon? Just signed up for an account and downloaded the app but I don't see it anywhere :(
@_date: 2016-11-30 12:04:16
Any services like this where you get to keep the number for 1 year for example? $9 (or more) per year for example...I don't need a temporary US number for sms, but a semi permanent one.
@_date: 2016-11-16 16:26:31
Kraken can't fund via ACH or even U.S bank wire....They basically serve only EU customers at this point....
I'm in the same boat as you...Only want to use ACH because wire transfers cost too much from my bank. So far the only options I've found are Circle and Coinbase....And Uphold will add ACH funding soon apparently, if we all bug them enough..
@_date: 2017-01-22 18:19:53
Link for more info?
Namely what bank/country, fees associated, does it stay in USD, etc.
Thanks in advance!

HaoBTC single handed added 40,000 TH/s this past week....How? From 70k to 110k now....
@_date: 2017-01-18 15:03:07
Be happy you got even to that step....They won't even let me register because I don't have a cell phone with one of the big 4 providers.....They've become Coinbase  KYC nazis.
@_date: 2016-12-18 16:46:41
Yes indeed, Celery just raised their buy and sell fee to 10%. Means at the current market price of ~$790 per bitcoin, you actually have to pay them 869 USD for it.
I am closing my account now and looking elsewhere....
@_date: 2016-11-18 22:05:54
Or better yet, don't use their shitty service at all. They will almost certainly willingly hand over all your information to the IRS anyway....

1) Whaleclub.co - Investment platform fully funded (deposits/withdrawals) in BTC
2) HaoBTC.com - BTC Interest savings account with 6%+ annual interest rate
Been using them both for months and making some nice additional profit vs just HODL'ing.
@_date: 2016-12-07 16:33:30
Would love to use Gemini but they don't want my money....
Way too strict KYC requirements....If you don't open your home/apartment (bill in your name), you can't sign up with their service. If you use a different phone provider (not AT&amp;T, T Mobile, or Verizon) you can't sign up...
Wtf? Why do they fucking care what number my provider is from? Fuck them....

How is Tangerine connected to TD Bank at all?

BTCC USD Exchange (it's instant USD-&gt;BTC-&gt;USD)

"QuadrigaCX has one of the most demanding KYC/AML client verification procedures in the industry, requiring clients to complete a credit verification via Equifax."
This couldn't be more true...It is IMPOSSIBLE to open an account with them. They go way above the legal mandate to hassle potential customers for more and more private information...I ultimately gave up and asked for them to delete my account and I definitely won't be going back to a site that doesn't respect users privacy....
@_date: 2017-05-08 22:43:52
Same issue here, not a good sign...
Withdrawing all my funds ASAP
