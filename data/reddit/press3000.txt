Is it limited technology or refusal to adapt?

Two wrongs make a right.  Likewise two bads make a good.

Well man,  I'm pretty sure I've learned about all there is to know from this post.  It's not gambling if I know I'll win,  right?  I'm going to keep my eyes on how things zigzag around and get rich soon enough.  I'll take you on that bet!

Thank you so much!

Eh, yeah, I'm getting the hint that it's all still gambling.  But,  I'm still young and stupid. I got the money floating about. Maybe I'll be the lucky dumb ass that scores big. If not,  lesson learn.

Haha,  I'm just watching it.  I wish I had started like a week before that post.  240 dollars all the way to 300 dollars for a bitcoin! I'm pretty sure it's just a spiked interest from the Eu act making it tax free or whatever.  So I'm just playing the waiting game and doing a little studying to make sure I don't mess up.

I'm guessing this is going to be me 
@_date: 2015-10-18 12:55:30
Thanks man,  I'll look into it

Any other site recommendation? I can do the instant buy with coinbase and have my usd wallet set up with them. I'm just not sure if they have any hidden fees whenever you converge the money.  I'm not looking to go crazy gamble with this.  I see that it zigzags  between 240 and 250 and any extra buck could really help.

Yeah,  I'll probably end up taking this as a learning experience.  Might look into poker after this
@_date: 2015-10-18 07:43:32
Is their a detailed guide I can look into explaining the in's and out's?
