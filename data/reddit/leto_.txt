I agree on the *new users* part 
@_date: 2017-03-28 06:56:28
could someone point me to something so that this starts making sense - I just don't get what's happening / weird here
@_date: 2017-03-28 07:23:47
oh, thanks a lot for this rundown - I have a lot to experience(and learn)
@_date: 2018-10-30 07:02:49
haha, this is quite funny - you should also have a hard fork &amp; a soft fork represented!

Absolutely aware of the things DABFI is doing and that's great. I'm just concerned about the way politicians have been dismissing, rather speaking against Bitcoin - calling it schemes, laundering etc. Hoping that you guys are bale to convince them right by making them understand that this is the future tech and as with everything, there are pros which outnumber its cons. All the very best and keep going ��

either one

I really don't think so (but this piques my interest!). What I'd say is that it would show both but(because their BSSID -mac address- would be different) may connect to anyone.
Will try this and get back in case I'm wrong!

yes, me thinks. Plus OP also seems to have removed the password, so an open hotspot.

let's see what the Indian govt comes up with. My guess is, given the nature of politicians in India, the take would be that it is something we don't understand, hence it is a ponzi scheme, hence illegal.
Hoping I'm wrong

You're not asking what the point is.
At all.

ok, that was my (failed, obviously) attempt at sarcasm. 
The text says that money can be created by bank at their will (slips of paper, new money) just like *that*.
And after reading that, what comes to mind is *Is the money really valuable in that case?* 
hoping this helps, peace.

i shudder to even think that!

Well finance should be an exact science, no?
But yeah, the sckeptism is valid given that this Bitcoin is an aberration from the usual instruments. 
I wonder why you are so certain this is unsustainable though. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 08:55:22
well, you may be right but... a lot of finance basics are getting pulverised these days
@_date: 2017-05-05 08:59:53
sorry for the n00b question, where the 2mn BTC gone, links pls
@_date: 2017-05-05 13:59:46
Haha, I wish that too - haven't participated in the buying yet, so I guess I'll hold at this phase 
@_date: 2017-07-19 12:58:21
hahaha, nice fix!
@_date: 2017-05-05 08:54:32
wow, happy for you!
@_date: 2017-05-05 13:30:01
what you're saying makes sense - conventional wisdom - and honestly, I wouldn't argue on financial markets (cause I really am no expert). Time shall tell what happens to bitcoin - but the ride so far has truly been crazy.

Yes, elucidated info will always help. Hope you read the comment by @_date: 2019-05-02 11:34:31
