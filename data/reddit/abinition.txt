ok....  might dismantle,  but its probably fine, as ot is extremely well ventilated , 
Miners dont have lithium ion batteries,  i don't see them exploding in flames, they are cool and the electric being supplied is heavy guage wire, properly breakered
@_date: 2019-08-16 17:53:08
hmmm, yes, put the shelf to the top, miners on top, pipes run downwards.   I like it.
@_date: 2019-08-17 16:39:23
70Th/s ... not too shabby
and if I sold the miners today, wow just looked, I'd make a $1000 profit.

The cat sleeps in the garage,  the pipes resonates the sound, so its quieter.  Needs more work on the exhaust part.
Solar panels may justify the satoshi's earned. otherwise im just a baby boomer who has too much free time on his hands.
Sh*t post for your amusement.

Cool. I'll look for that. Thanks.

not, hot air blows out bottom, pipes are intakes only, closed space is cool air
@_date: 2019-08-16 14:52:32
acoustic reasons.  air goes in the pipes and hot air goes out the bottom.  simple actually,  but guess its not obvious..lol
@_date: 2019-08-16 15:01:56
thank you.  safety first.  good idea.
@_date: 2019-08-16 02:23:18
70Th/s, 2 S9's, 1 T17.  It blows hot, but ill add a 10" hose to send that plus extra noise outdoors.  Cat doesn't like it now, but wait till winter. ha.
it is mining well over 100,000 satoshi's per day.
going to HODL them....
@_date: 2019-08-16 15:00:26
the cat rules, he will get his domain back soon enough I think
@_date: 2019-08-16 04:56:13
They are on 240v receptacles (more efficient), estimate 3000+ watts total. Not sure how much the solar will offset the cost, but doubtful it's profitable,l. If 1 satoshi ever equals 1 penny, then I'd be pulling in $1000/day in future earnings.  Honestly, brand new minted bitcoin is intriguing. Created from mathematics.  Never to be repeated.
@_date: 2019-08-16 14:50:32
hot air is blowing out and ends up outside, entire apparatus actually maintains a cool temperature, no circulation going on

@_date: 2019-08-16 14:45:21
thanks for your concern, but electrical sockets are breakered properly,  exhaust is all blown outwards,  temperature around miners is ambient, and decorative pipes are intakes only.  Hazzard from what exactly?

Well, logarithmic is great and all, but is it sustainable. Is it really tending long term? Seems we are off that path now.   (Or else are due for a major correction).  I think the equation has changed.  Quadratic now.

The real spoiler is that Spider-Man is really Satoshi Nakamoto and the pass phrases died with him.

I stand corrected.  Neutron bombardment. Wow.

No gold "absolutely" cannot be made at nuclear facilities from other metals.. Omg. Only supernovae create gold.   What you are thinking of is some electron valence fidgeting. We are not added neutrons and protons to other elements.
@_date: 2019-09-04 01:25:35
depends on whether its satoshi's to pennies or satoshi's to dollars, in all fairness lets go after the penny first
@_date: 2019-09-04 01:26:56
give the copper penny some credit,  lets not skip that parity

Theoretically, with infinite (enough) hash power, you could rewrite any N blocks back.  The longest chain wins when majority concedes.

FB membership peaked at 2.4B, that's 114 times greater than 21M, therefore one BTC is worth 5K x 114.  Actually. more, because it's a fire sale.

BB are more receptive, they listen, they nod, they do nothing. Millennials listen, ask questions, do nothing.  ATM just down the street from the brewpub, easy $40, exciting like your first time.  Nope.  Nada.  Fad, fantasy.

I had to subscribe and pay to use that curve fitting feature. :-(  
Not surprising math heads are all over it.

Better luck probably with a funny meme.

We mere humans perceive growth in a linear progression. We will never get used to exponential growth, always taking us by surprise.  A single nexus event could easily explode us upward, if not for the steady growth of the fundamentals.

Ahem.  Hhmph. Phfft.   Pretty much everyone is in denial or delusional.   I am a 57 Chevy, grayefil to have found this revolution.  Its harder than ever to educate anyone on this topic, except my Hispanic friends who have family due south, they get it totally.  They hug me and slap my back.
