Pretty much exactly the same story here.

I understood that as a way to illustrate the point.

The current price of Apple is probably only temporary. Fundamentally they are massively undervalued, and the only way for the stock price to make sense is if they start with substansial decline in earnings. Perhaps they will, but probably not.

I don't have that much experience. I moved a small amount there and bought some, I've had no problems. Haven't withdrawn yet.. 
They seem respectable enough, but I'm in no way an expert..
Inga problem =)

Lol, that's a lot of diverse questions. 
I'm waiting for the bottom, when I'll invest (gamble) for a very small amount..

As I said, if their earnings start do decline a lot their stock price makes sense (according to sound fundamental metrics a la Graham). Perhaps you're right that that will be the case, I don't think so. Their markets are hardly saturated and some (China, India) are growing fast (even in the US the markets are still growing a fair bit). So if they retain market share and margins they'll earn more.

You hate people for buying what they like. Who's the douche?
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:15:19
How can you talk about fundamentals?..
