The two graphs unfortunately don’t auto update but everything else does. If I can find the raw data or a way to pull it with an api I will make the graphs so they are dynamic

Yeah that’s a good question based on what I’m seeing right now it doesn’t really make sense to start mining bitcoin right now. You would only be mining at a loss if you you can’t earn enough to cover the cost of electricity, but the payback period is so long it isn’t worth while because you’d end up with more bitcoin if you just purchased it on an exchange with the same amount of money you would plan to spend on hardware and electricity cost.

What is the impact of breadwallet decision or views on this matter? I guess more specifically what are the implications of leaving your bitcoin in bread wallet if they have this view?

Based on my understanding of what I just read from the links you shared it seems like it would be logical to move your btc funds to a different wallet or maybe coinbase temporarily until the range of possible scenarios with breadwallet plays out? Is that rational or am I missing the big picture implications?
