95% of their users uninstalled the app because they removed this feature. I'm speculating that percentage, but seriously why remove such a powerful feature? Couldn't they have kept it as a supplement to their new features? 
I personally uninstalled it, spare change was the only reason that I wanted to use Lawnmower, and even with the new features, I'm just not interested if Spare Change isn't part of it.

[Ron Paul agrees with Trump Re: The Federal Reserve](
I would argue that Trump is the most favorable candidate possible at this time toward cryptocurrency because he understands that competition makes all things better. For this reason i don't think he's someone who would regulate Bitcoin in the way that people think (I don't think he'd regulate it at all), I think he'd be very hands-off.

My dad was talking to (insert major corporation here) regarding an incorrect late charge on his account of 30 years while the person on the other end (obviously new to this) told him the way things were going to be with his account.  Long story short he told the representative that if they looked at his history they will notice that he had never been late on a payment on the past 30 years and had been a high volume customer over that entire period. The rep was dismissive and my dad began threatening to withdraw his business from them, at which point another agent came on the line who had been there for much longer and began to beg and apologize to my dad regarding this behavior and even offered to credit his account to keep his business.
In the end, unless we live under government sanctioned monopolies, the customer is still king. This guy could have taken his business elsewhere, or at least threatened to do so.

This is the desperation of statists coming out saying "We need regulation of X because X will buy Y for group Z, and Y in the hands of Z will kill your family."
It's all propaganda tactics, just like how the word "Anarchy" was gradually fed to us alonside pictures of molotov coctails and violence to incite fear in us whenever we heard it (since government wants us to feel as though we can't live without it).  This is exactly where government will take the word "bitcoin", because if the mainstream media start feeding the propaganda of violence and shady business along with the word bitcoin when that word becomes more prevalent, you'll know it has already begun.
