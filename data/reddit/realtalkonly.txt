Well no shit tax money is used to provide for society. 
It looks like you misunderstood my original comment. By "contribution to society", I'm referring to doing work that contributes to society. This could involve providing valuable labor, creating businesses/jobs, etc. [I stated elsewhere in the thread]( that I believe that with great power comes great responsibility, and the simple act of spending money on frivolous things does not earn my respect any more than that of a lottery winner who blows it on lambos and cocaine. 
By your definition of "contributing to society", some trust fund kid who spends his entire life not working and buying shit is contributing to society. That's not how I define "contributing to society", taxation notwithstanding. Anybody else gifted with the same access to money could do the same thing. Nobody is going to go down in the history books for having "contributed to society via sales tax paid on selfish consumption".
Regarding your attempt at discrediting my argument via personally attacking me, no I'm actually not a starving artist on welfare, I'm an engineer with a $150k/yr salary, not that that has anything to do with the topic at hand.

I'm a huge believer of "with great power comes great responsibility". I don't respect this guy any more than I respect some random lottery winner who chooses to spend the entirety of his fortune on selfish endeavors.

I never said he was selfish

So buying a $10,000 handbag equates to contributing to society because there's sales tax?
I hope you don't get rich, because that'd be a pretty dire societal misallocation of resources.

the mental gymnastics people undergo to rationalize this false belief that money received = contribution to society...

right, because any questioning as to why you guys are jerking off some rich guy means I'm merely just expressing my jealousy
