Wow there was a fork just about every day in December 2017. Wonder if anyone made money off of those.

Thank god finally the definitive proof I needed to know we are near a bull run. Time to invest my life savings!!!

I dont know, looks like the place shut down.

Yea for real. When either the longs or shorts pile up things get manipulated and causes these bets to liquidate.

Can we stop with the "which one of you redditors did this" bullshit posts. Not everyone who is interested in bitcoin is on reddit, let alone this sub.

Looks like Jesus to me

Yea no better way to "discredit the corporate system" by giving corporations and the people that run them a massive tax break. 
The people that see Trump as some sort of hero or "Snowden" (lol) are fucking delusional. 
@_date: 2019-01-02 01:58:51
What do you see in the near future?
@_date: 2019-01-05 17:57:11
Fair enough. I just dont get why people think Trump is the catalyst or even supporting of such a scenario. 
@_date: 2019-09-28 14:47:39
I agree. I cant stand stupid posts like this that try to dumb down fairly complicated economics into a simplified image like this.
@_date: 2018-07-24 22:01:51
Then we are back to square one (see above)
@_date: 2018-04-02 15:27:03
The license plate says Washington DC...
@_date: 2019-05-05 18:28:06
