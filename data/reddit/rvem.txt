There is definitely an increased volume.
Highest since the "flippening"

Bittrex. 17 days and counting.
Stay away from that dogshit exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:50:55


On bitthumb?
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:40:36
That was a correction. 
~23% dip is a correction.

I signed up in November, took me less than a day to get verified.
I'd bet the delays are due to the huge influx of coinbase refugees.
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:54:27
Thank you, that was succinct.
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:39:48
That sucks man.
Just put your coins in a hardware wallet and forget about it. 
Don't listen to news, don't visit any forums, just leave it alone. 
By now you must've learnt that nothing can kill bitcoin so hodling will have just become very easy for you.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:59:23
It is a korean exchange with 0 fee trading.
The easiest exchange to pump and dump.

To anyone interested in an extensive FAQ of tax implications of trading bitcoin, here is link I saved:

Sell? 
Sell for what?
You won't need to sell.
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:19:13
Yeah, no..
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:32:09
Hey, this might be easier to get: 
@_date: 2017-11-04 04:08:33
Until the question becomes irrelevant.
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:11:07
I just don't feel like the time and stress is worth it. Yeah, you might save a few bucks or a hundred but in the long term they are just peanuts. Just buy whenever you have the money and hold on.
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:48:52
We need that sub to keep the shills and the deceivers contained.
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:04:52
I hope you got back in.

The Ripple protocol is mainly used by banks for processing transactions and looks promising but I can't figure out why the hell the XRP cryptocurrency is in any way relevant (besides it utility within the ripple ecosystem) or why the hell it even is a cryptocurrency. 
If I wanted to get some Ripple I'd buy shares of the company instead of the "cryptocurrency" but they are a private company so I can't do that.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:19:03
Yes, that's how percentage increments usually work.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:14:06
It is generally a good idea to diversify and Ethereum is a good choice. 
If you are feeling adventurous you can try Monero. 
I feel like litecoin's price is too tightly coupled with bitcoin's and rest of the alts are shit.
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:38:41


This is just retarded and I do not use that word loosely. 


That is how you sound. There may be valid arguments against crypto but yours is definitely not one.
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:41:02
Every single desperate attempt at shilling and attacking only makes us stronger.
Thanks for testing the resilience of the coin and the community. 
And you did all of this for free! :)

@_date: 2017-11-14 18:50:55
I used to be like you until I truly gave into the HODL philosophy.
Real hodl-ers don't give a fuck what the price is doing short term, the are just chilling doing other things.
Every single failed attack only pushed me further into the hodl-ness. 
Give into the hodl-ness OP, achieve Zen.
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:46:52
Also don't forget "clean" coal shilling.
@_date: 2017-11-09 06:03:34


They *tried* to seize control of a decentralized currency.
Are you suggesting that only the magnitude of effort to try and do this is the only thing that is relevant here?
Fuck them for trying to destroy the vision of a decentralized currency. 
Fuck you for trying to defend these assholes.
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:47:24
Jesus! They keep making up new shit. 
Is the new series any good?
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:45:46
Today was a good day!
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:14:10
Well, the first one came true, so I guess you are 50% accurate.
@_date: 2017-11-04 04:02:54
Not only did that guy trade altcoins but he "learned" TA.
And he calls the hodler's retarded? lol
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:04:05
Legitimate accounts are being hacked and used for vote manipulation. 
Maybe banning legit user accounts, even though compromised, might not be the best course of action? 
Think of this as a dip in the bitcoin community, it'll just blow over because we are the motherfucking moneybadgers of crypto.
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:28:16
News, talks, updates, roadmap discussion and maybe price discussion without memes?
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:29:42
I wouldn't consider LARPing a job.
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:26:34
If B2X attack wins then then bitcoin is a failed experiment and I will be pulling out all the money I've invested no matter how high it could go.
I invested in the vision of a decentralized currency not more of the same bullshit we already have and been subjected to.
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:41:52
Applying laws of thermodynamics to economics is like applying freudian psychology to bass fishing.
Please put at least some effort into learning about bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-09-28 06:13:58
Astute technical analysis, my friend.
@_date: 2017-10-08 23:47:34
I use gemini due to their low fees, GDAX has lower fees too but the verification didn't work for me. Gemini got me verified in ~12 hrs. 
Coinbase will kill you with their fees.
@_date: 2017-09-29 23:19:36
"How would one know this is a legit business meeting?" you may ask.
Just look at that naming! of course it is legit. No one pulls out such shitty terms out their ass, so masterfully, like a bunch of MBAs.
@_date: 2017-10-10 06:29:32
Because windows is an un-secure piece of shit OS. It is basically malware that also acts like an OS.

It looks good!

Bitcoin to the SUN!!
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:17:00
That's a real gamble m8
@_date: 2017-10-24 06:37:56


Yes. Otherwise the entire thing is a failure.

Fucking hell! I laughed out loud like a moron, everybody in the office is looking at me right now.

"During" November according to this: 
@_date: 2017-09-29 23:09:10
Next thing you'll hear is his firm placed a buy order for 10,000 coconuts on the down low.
Sneaky bankers man..
@_date: 2017-10-01 05:24:47
I feel you man. 
My favorite Robinhood theme was red when I dabbled in stocks.
@_date: 2017-10-15 04:30:50
I'm in Washington, I used gemini.
@_date: 2017-10-23 07:45:10
What is that? I'm interested
@_date: 2017-10-08 04:01:51
big if true
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:06:05


Can I have your private keys then?
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:37:40
Never ever use coinbase, that fee is so easily avoidable that it baffles me when people still use that site to buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-13 00:02:47
I just came on here to say that we are at $5426 right now.
Fuck the moon, we are shooting for the sun!
@_date: 2017-10-05 05:35:10
I am sorry, but you are advocating to give a person who is a proven fraud/fame-whore a platform, I don't think you came here for a "reasonable" discussion.
I think we have enough of those people running our government and the banks. We don't need them in our bitcoin community.
@_date: 2017-10-10 03:41:34
Why do you say this is the worst time possible? 
I legit want to know, pls respond.
@_date: 2017-10-06 17:19:24
Didn't follow the bcash thing, did people really trade that shitcoin for btc 1:1?
@_date: 2017-10-15 04:12:33
@_date: 2017-10-10 02:16:41
It would be valued in negative USD, you'll pay to lose money.
@_date: 2017-09-28 06:42:26
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:38:41
Gemini or Gdax if you don't want to pay huge amount of fees.
@_date: 2017-10-11 00:46:20
Just do what you like man. 
If the butt load of posts and articles that are already out there didn't convince you I doubt a few more comments will.
@_date: 2017-10-15 08:06:24
Your phone just time traveled.
No big deal.
@_date: 2017-10-01 05:18:39
Waiting for that FUD dip due to S2X to load up big time. I'm guessing it'll start from mid October.

Hodl my bits
@_date: 2017-09-29 23:11:32
So are miner fees not accounted for in the exchange fees for gemini?
@_date: 2017-10-24 17:04:04
Yup, I guess I'll have to buy a Trezor now.
@_date: 2017-10-11 00:42:06
You dropped this -&gt; /s
@_date: 2017-10-10 04:38:13
Why do you think there is going to be another correction?
@_date: 2017-10-15 06:12:58
Is that really the conclusion you came to, after reading that page?
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:46:31
It was the constant shilling on /biz/ that initially pushed me away from it.
@_date: 2017-10-14 00:41:57
He is terrified.

^ The only acceptable valuation.
