Hodlers of the world, untie!

Bix Weir found article from Dean of Wharton School of Business. The dean apparently visited Silicon Valley attending series of fin tech meetings, said everyone so bullish about Crypto/Bitcoin. It's all they talked about. Dean was old guard, steeped in traditional finance, has new views/awakening. Believes we are facing the end of money. Weir added disruption in crypto coming from investors transitioning out of Innovator phase of market penetration and into Early Adoption phase. Uplifting article/video. Look up Bix Weir. You won't FUD if you have a big pix perspective. Hodl is key to winning whether up or down. Remember, CME derivitives settlement is Friday. Buying opportunities.

Buying doesn't interrupt HODLing. You can do both. But sell and you instantly become a non-hodler. (No selling my ETH. *Bullish*).

Yeah. In 2014 Bear Whale cashed out 30,000 bitcoin at one time @ $300 bc he tired of them staying at that level. Great YouTube video of the chart activity set to music. Epic.

Gemini has never failed me yet. �� Gemini!

Me: missed APPL in '97 at $37. Thought Steve Jobs was done. Sigh. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:58:50
Wow. Great stories here. I'm 63, female. Alone w/no kids, family or even friends in California. Lost sight in one eye. Got cats. Regret a missed chance at APPL for $36 in 1996. Never got over it. Struggled thru the yrs. Two months ago, found ETH and now hodling happily for 3-5+ years as it develops. It's like MSFT in 1979. It took nearly 30 years to find this new opportunity. So, never, ever give up. Remember why God made the world round: So we can't see too far ahead.

Don't forget the chances for loss were much greater back then. It truly was the Wild West. We forget that.

Yeah, my new ETH portfolio just went over $1000+ in profit.  Bitcoin and Ethereum are both scheduled for big $ derivative market action prob 1Q 2018. I hodl.

Had my Ledger Nano for over a month. Still in its unopened box. Terrified that I'll mess up the device or my transactions. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:07:53
Yep. Gemini. In NYC. FDIC. They treat me right!��

Well, I live alone and am investing in crypto all by myself at age 63. I'm not exactly savvy under the hood, so to speak. However, I am advantaged with a solid background in advertising &amp; marketing and was a tech innovater as far back as 1984. Soooo--here I am again. Another learning curve which gets more difficult to manage as one ages. But this time, I cannot make transactional mistakes or I lose all my coins. People getting into this should be aware that nefarious players on the sidelines are just waiting for the herd to make wrong moves. Taking coins off the exchange and placing them elsewhere invites error. It just does. Every time. That's why Coinbase scares the Hell out of me. I'm an ETH hodler on Gemini supported by 2FA through Authy. I would not live long enough to recover from a monetary failing and so far, so good. You guys in your 20s have "forever" and you can recover. I can't. So, my fears are age-related. And I don't have anyone to ask for help. It's the wild, wild west and I'm alone out here except for the internet folks.

It's a dirty trick of bait &amp; switch -- rigged so their self-serving, centralized and unpopular new version (2X) becomes falsely labeled as the winner. Right? If so, very cunning. You gotta know these guys will try to gain control of Bitcoin by whatever means necessary. Their interference will destroy it.

Thanks for your nice reply Classicpass. I woke up to ETH $506 this morning. What an early Christmas gift that was! Onward, my friend. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:06:17
But apparently the process is set up so the exchanges do all the government's dirty work. Gov maintains stranglehold with their centralized exchanges which are, by necessity, connected to our money when we buy Bitcoin. No getting around them en masse. And no wonder they made Coinbase so user-friendly.

This is why Trump will audit the Fed. Audits will tell an astounding story.

HERE. IS. THE. PROBLEM. (Everybody ready?) We are all excited about our wonderful decentralized Bitcoin/ETH  blockchain benefits but we are allowing centralized systems to handle the administration. Centralized!!! Staff? Wait times?? Webcams??? Are you kidding??? I'm waiting for Kyber, the ICO Ethereum-based decentralized exchange which employs smart contracts and eliminates all the bulky stuff. PLUS: NO MORE PLUNKING DOWN FUNDS AHEAD OF GETTING AN ACCOUNT! And Kyber is recommended (backed) by Vitalik Buterin, ETH founder. However, it's not in the US yet. But another decentralized is worth looking into: 0xProject. Same kind of situation. I think this is the future. Smart Contracts via ETH. Yea!!!

Thats bc our US patent attys and government overloards are corrupt and steal the ideas, fund them through the CIA and rewrite history. *cough* Facebook technology *cough* stolen from Leader Technologies...

In crypto for a year. Only bought. Never sold. No lost coins. Happy.

WE ARE A REPUBLIC-NOT A DEMOCRACY! The left is intentionally--and erroneously--describing America as a Democracy hoping to one day crush individualism, they're trying to change the narrative. A republic honors and protects the rights of the individual which they disdain. A democracy is the same structure, but it honors and protects the group. THEY ARE PUSHING MARXIST,  COMMUNIST GROUP-THINK. We must call them out on this error every time! It's a slippery slope. They're taking over subconsciously, incrementally--one small piece at a time. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 15:47:51
Yikes for sure. This gruesome Satanic practice takes place all over the world including here, even as we speak, "right before our eyes" yet it remains under the radar because of personal threat of death to those who dare to speak. It will come out but most are hiding this practice among their elite peers. Its believed that reg Americans wont be able to handle the truth. Cannibalism is reason no one can find the missing 800,000 missing children from Virginia. (Washington DC is a cauldron.) Hint: Spirit Cooking!
