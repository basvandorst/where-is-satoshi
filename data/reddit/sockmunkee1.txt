Totally cool!  Baby Satoshi is gonna have many 'Ninong/Ninangs' now!
BTW, I just 'joined' Bitcoin PH thanks to fimp's OP.  Didn't know of your FB group.  I'm in the States, though (Fil-Am right here).

Well, I'm glad the identity thing has been settled!  I hope all is well, Arthur!  
@_date: 2014-03-10 12:56:37
Well, I'd  like to believe this is Dorians brother. The OP did seem sincere and just wanted to "thank" the community.  And, he wasn't asking for anything.  I do hope it's not a troll.  I wish he would take my offer and post a bathroom selfie holding a sign "free lunch" while holding his drivers license and his business card and today's date! :)

I'll think I'll be driving down to TJ next weekend to check it out!  It's  a painful wait at the Border coming back up to the US.
@_date: 2014-03-10 07:32:03
He's the real deal.  Arthur posted his drivers license, business card and photo at the bottom of his first introductory post a few days ago.  Look it up. 
@_date: 2014-05-14 06:03:36
Better not tell Newsweek magazine - especially that whacko reporter lady. They might claim he's the founder of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 07:50:44
I see your point. Maybe he could do a selfie holding a sign: "free lunch!"
@_date: 2014-03-24 16:47:34
I will do the same.  Great idea!
@_date: 2014-05-14 06:05:21
And, Congrats on your new bundle of joy! Get the baby a QR code addy now!

I'd be curious to know/wonder if this ATM is subject to KYC banking regulations down in Mexico.

I proclaim thee, "CEO of bitcoin!"
I think I'll have to add that title to my resume and on my business card. 
@_date: 2014-05-16 17:55:40
I thought I read his name as "War Hammer."  I was going to say nice name!
It's "Hammer Time."
Anywayz, you got my support.  Good luck!
@_date: 2014-03-11 02:26:39
You non-believers owe him some free lunch now...Imma just saying!
@_date: 2014-03-09 05:58:20
Free lunch and model train parts!  "Oh, Myyy!"
@_date: 2014-03-30 14:48:07
Interesting info. 
IMHO you might also get some good feedback from several 'experts'  over at:  
Or, one of the other IT support subs. 
Good luck.

Now I feel bad, I only sent 0.0012345 of BTC!  Maybe Dorian can get a senior discount coffee at McDonalds with this small amount...
@_date: 2014-02-20 17:06:01
Thanks for the info!
@_date: 2014-03-19 17:52:38
+1. I like it!
@_date: 2014-03-30 14:19:16
Did he replace the last "Bicoin CEO" after she allegedly committed suicide a few months ago? 😉
@_date: 2014-03-08 22:08:39
Great video!  I've sent some 'bitswana' coins to you, 
Much success to your mission!
@_date: 2014-04-22 21:11:50
Darn, I almost shed a tear.  
@_date: 2014-03-09 13:19:28
OP, that was very generous of you and glad to see it didn't turn into a big flame war.  Great debate. And, I can't believe I used to be a clueless WoW player back in my "younger" days!  Some of them def need to be b!tch slapped!
@_date: 2014-05-14 14:03:15
Yup, I agree, it is a nice name.  Yes, it may seem strange/weird at first, but this is our little BTC world we are in.
Now, all you critics and haters, leave Baby Satoshi alone! 
(Actually, if Baby Satoshi were born in Japan I don't think it would be weird at all.)
@_date: 2014-04-04 14:47:42
Let's see. I think it's  more like "locations." One in TJ, Mexico.  One in Silicon Valley. And, "several" units in Vancouver if recent memory serves me correct.

It's supposed to be in Mountain View at the address here:
It was first featured at the Bitconference meeting up there in Mountain View recently:
@_date: 2014-04-06 10:17:14
Okay, here it is...and the latest info.  It's operated by Coinage, LLC but at  place called 'Hacker Dojo'
see link below with the EXACT address!
@_date: 2014-05-31 19:38:13
Finally, they did something right. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 06:22:15
Sweet. I need to order me a few!
