I just posted something on the Norwegian bitcoin story, but it's kind of ridiculous the way these things work. My father has spent the last 25 years of his life working massive days, taking enormous risks and taking one week's holiday every year, owning his own business. He's employed many people throughout this time, weathered multiple financial crises and designed and patented multiple high-tech products.
But he's never pulled a profit, never been able to pay himself a proper salary and was always too far in to give up (the life of a single director). Finally his company's been forced under and he'll spend the rest of his life in debt, not to mention the enormous hit on his pride in never being able to provide for his family in the way he wanted, or being able to realise his dreams of leaving a mark on the world through popularising his products (which would truly be a game changer for many in the non-developed world).
Meanwhile, guys like you will likely never have to work again.
I'm a pretty staunch libertarian, but I struggle to rationalise how people can be staggeringly rewarded completely out of line with merit, or endeavour, or taking risk. Good on you if you were smart (lucky) enough to get on bitcoin early. But I hope you do something amazing with your newfound wealth. Regardless of how much research or time you put into Bitcoin, the primary reason that you're rich is still luck. I'm not proposing that your money isn't yours, but I hope you appreciate the crazy set of circumstances that have led to you being wealthier than people who will spend their entire lives struggling.

Great idea. Just had a look at other charities/initiatives that accept bitcoin, here's a great list:
