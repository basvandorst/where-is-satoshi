Every encryption scheme relies on a particular piece being "hard"  to compute. I believe RSA and DSA rely on factoring large numbers to be hard.  ECC relies on the discrete logarithm to be hard.  The reason that paper is cited is because they show that quantum computers not only can factor large numbers but they also make it realistic to solve the descrete logorithm.

User wanting a vanity address generates a private-public keypair Q=q * G and hands Q to server.  Server repeatedly guesses for new v and computes (v * G)+Q=Q'  until Q' matches the desired pattern. Once found, server then sends v to the user who computes (q+v)=q'. q' is the private key to the vanity Q' and only he knows it.  The ecdsa math isn't hard.

Is not really what happens, though it's an accurate close description. The truth is the work continues on the chain with the *most work* done on it.  Thus, if a chain with fewer blocks had a higher difficulty and the sum of the work in those blocks was more than the work in the longer-but-less-difficult chain, the shorter chain would be the target. This is why, if you browse the bitcoin source code, the terminology used is "Best Chain", not "Longest Chain".

This is why I wish the nLockTime field was part of a txout rather than the tx itself. Because then it could be included in a block and the network would use nLockTime to prevent it from being used as an input (spent) instead. 
It could even have been done with the scripting system with an opcode like OP_GETBLOCKHEIGHT or OP_GETBLOCKTIME.
@_date: 2014-10-06 16:58:42
You are right.  Difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks and it's limited in how fast it can change.
If there was a drastic decline in hashing power, say, 75%, block times would slow to a ridiculous 40 minutes. The readjustment would then happen within the next 8 weeks later instead of the typical 2.  And (I don't have the math handy), the adjustment *might not* even bring it back to 10 minutes yet.

It depends on whether Bitcoin is to be classified a currency or an asset.
If it's a currency, you'll need to report income tax; if it's an asset, you'll need to report capital gains at the time you trade it for goods or fiat.  Until the government gives guidance on Bitcoin-as-a-currency, you'll have to make up your mind on how you report.

Not really.  A towing company can move your car for you.
Edit:  I love talking about what it means to "own" Bitcoins. I think everyone here realizes that in order to transfer Bitcoins you require the private key.  If you "own" anything, it's the knowledge of the private key.  So the question becomes, can you own a number? I don't think you can technically own it.  But, you can be lucky enough to be the only one to *know* it. 
Thought experiment: think of a number between 1 and 100.  Don't tell me.  Now, do you feel that you own that number?  You *know* the number, but you probably don't feel like you *own* that number.  It's just a number. Now think of a number between 1 and 2^256.  Do you own that?
When it comes to Bitcoin, what you have when you know a private key is the ability to convince a network of computers to execute a specific program (recall that the core of Bitcoin transactions are scripts).  The only parameter to that script is a value between 0 and 2100000000000000 and that parameter is called the *amount* (of bitcoins).  It's indeed interesting to ask, do I own those bitcoins?
As another point of view, take the brain wallet pass phrase "crazy horse battery staple".  It hashes to the private key e8e6d05fa45f08d89851e1b94d9802bbb689429dab26977bbace8cdef488f73f.  Now you and I both know the key, so if someone were to send bitcoins to the associated address, who owns the bitcoins? You or me?

The blockchain is indeed a general purpose database.  Each output is a  series of bytes that are fed into a script processor that does things, and the script processor is content agnostic.  As long as you're paying the fees for the CPUs to process these instructions, then you're using the blockchain **as it's written**, even if their intent (of non-generality) was ill-described in code.

In order to handle visa's 2500 tps, Bitcoin's block size would need to be at least 2500 * 60 * 10 * 2000 / 8 (375 Mbyte) in size. And the bandwidth to transfer those blocks.. to every node...

I've never thought about it like this before but here's an enthusiastic YES TO THIS. 
What's a great way to get a bitcoin wallet onto the computers of lots of people? Why, you integrate it into software that millions of people already have installed and have it automatically update. 
Imagine sending money over Skype? A lot of people are already set up to buy Skype credits. If Microsoft would allow you to buy BTC with Skype credit, and then send it anyone in your address book (or withdraw it), I have no doubt that it would destroy PayPals business model.

Why does everyone think that a growing mempool is a problem? 


The fourth case is that we write a few lines of code to throw away (i.e. free up memory) old/nonpriority transactions from the mempool before running out of ram.
Also, my 5yo desktop machine has 8gb ram. Transactions are usually less than 500 bytes. That's a lot of transactions. I won't run out of ram from mempool next year.

I believe Eligius will still try to mine any valid script; so you could technically do any valid M of N, just not publish it to the network and expect it to be relayed.  If you contact and/or push through eligius, the transaction would likely get mined in the next eligius block.

The ability to do something without someone else's permission is kind of what defines an inalienable right. Your mouth and mind allow you to speak whatever, which is proof enough (for me) that free speech is inherent to your existence and not a privilege of your locale, for example.

It's clear you don't understand and this my last response. If enough hashing power drops such that block times fall to 100 minutes/block, then coin production time falls as well and the above may come into play.

I wonder if a debit card is in coinbase's long term strategy.  They've set themselves up to do this too: they have money transmitter licenses, have an account/brokerage system and now they're connecting an exchange to these things.  If you have BTC in your account and a debit card, Coinbase could easily insta-sell to cover any debits on a debit card.
@_date: 2015-01-15 08:02:21
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:33:55
Nice post.
An interesting side-effect of a lower TPS is fee competition. If we fall to something like &lt;1 TPS you can bet your pearly pants that fees will rise just to be sure your tx makes it into the block that's 100 minutes away. Higher fees (at least theoretically) should encourage more mining.
And yet another cool side-effect of long block times is that miners won't be dumping as many coins onto the market, reducing supply and creating some upward price pressure. 
In an efficient market, all of these really interesting forces should come together somewhere to create price equilibrium.

But not by you, so why do you care? Only the fully verifying nodes (miners, companies like exchanges) need to store the blocks long term. Even then some can enable pruning to delete old txns from disk. SPV and watch wallets don't need to care about blocksize nor "type" of transaction others are making. 
Your post is teetering on centralized planning by saying not all transactions are created equal. They are all valid, regardless of fee. The fee serves as an econimic bribe to miners to include the tx in a block. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 10:49:33
Someone supporting the BTC side could do the same and dump 300k BU coins crashing the BU price as well. The argument in your post goes both ways. If you're a believer that BTC is the winner, you should buy up all of Ver's coins, since they'll (by your own argument) be cheap. 
The smart move is to hold  your split coins on both chains until there's a clear "winner". 
Now if you like gambling with lots of risk, sell all of one split and hold the other.

Uhm, no. The blockchain will be 864GB, requiring only a 1TB or 2TB drive but in 15 years 30-50TB will probably be common and cheap.  Downloading 864GB on a 1Gbit/sec connection (which also hopefully would be common place in 15 years) would take about 2 hours.
CurrentBTCChainSize = 130 GB (approx)
RateOfGrowth = 1000000 bytes per 10 minutes
YearlyRateOfGrowth = RateOfGrowth\*6\*24\*365 = ~48.9 GB/year
FinalBTCChainSize = 130 GB + 15 \* 48.9 GB = 863.5 GB
Edit: For the time for download calculation:
FinalBTCChainSizeInBits = FinalBTCChainSize \* 8 = 6908 Gbit
DownloadRate = 1 Gbit/sec
DownloadChainTime = FinalBTCChainSize / DownloadRate = 6908 Gbit / (1 Gbit/sec) = 6908 sec
TimeInHours = 6908 / 60 / 60  = 1.92 hours

Mining on a block is happening 24/7 even when blocks are being downloaded. When a new transaction comes in worth adding to a block the transaction is probably added to near the top of the list because merkle root is cheaper to compute -- two hashes, instead of thousands.  If BitcoinCore software doesn't do this and wastes computation just to order txns by fee, then ¯\(º_o)/¯

You'd have to aim for something like 1 hour, 1.5 hours.  Variations in solving the block would mean if you tried to aim for 1.99 hours you'd eventually mess up and EDA would hit.

Better, would be zero inflation, and a money supply that adjusted to match actual economic output of the community - but that sort of system seems to require god like prescience ... making it rather unlikely.
I don't think that's true at all. The market would set interest rates on loans (positive in an inflationary period, negative in a deflationary period).  I think you're making the assumption that interest rates are always positive.
In an era of free market money that may mean that if your savings were increasing (period of deflation) yet wanted a loan, you may only have to pay back some amount less.
It would be lenders' job to analyze prices in the market and figure out the "price of money."

A simple whitelist could be used for larger websites (say, mtgox or coinbase) and then a more complicated trust system could be used with individuals and smaller businesses.

FWIW, Bitcoins don't actually live in your wallet.  In many ways, the Bitcoin wallet isn't a wallet at all, but instead a store of private keys associated with your Bitcoin addresses.
One might also conclude that your coins are stored on everyone's computer (that runs the full client) in the form of a transaction in some block.
Once you grasp that concept, it makes sense that you can have coins delivered to you when your computer is offline / not synced / etc.

Another key thing to be concerned about is anonymity.  Since it's up the merchant who he trusts, he *could* trust self-signed certificates, allowing customers to prove they are the same person from last time but still remain anonymous.   
@_date: 2012-11-22 02:45:59
That requires trusting the merchant with a private key of yours, a solution I'm not sure I find appealing.
@_date: 2012-11-21 15:42:38
Right - SSL is just a secure sockets layer, but I did mean to refer specifically to the https certificate issued by trusted signers, so that the certificates and public keys are easily fetchable from companies that you choose to trust.
Another interesting extension would be continued-business-trust.  If you have a customer who comes in repeatedly, require your default 1-or-more confirmations on his first few transactions, and then after successful business, add his public key to your database of trusted individuals.

The thing that I don't get is how it can even be considered.  I'll tell you why:
I run a mining node and I won't adopt any software that allows for recovery of "unused" coin.  This decision, by me alone, would cause the blockchain to fork if others chose to implement unused coin recovery schemes.
And because I'm not alone, the blockchain fork will be major.  Changes to Bitcoin infrastructure like this instantly divides the network into two blockchains.  
Like silly Statist laws that make drugs illegal, you cannot *force* everyone to comply.  It's a fantasy and a complete disregard for reality.

gotta realize too, that the block difficulty won't adjust right away.  a small number of miners (in the isolated network) will be solving a tremendously difficult problem.  The length of the isolated chain isn't likely to get very long very fast, and thus very few transactions will have inputs from the new blocks.
if iran is cut off for a long enough time that this becomes a problem, I think there's probably bigger issues at hand.  
it would also only take one node who has an outside connection (sat, wimax, etc) to bring in the outside blockchain.  the scenario seems particularly unlike.

I read the entire paper on NG, and while I think they have indeed proposed a cool new improvement I just don't see how it addresses the block size issue in entirety. 
The constant-size key block is pretty nice, but the microblocks (why are they even called *micro*?) would scale in size per tx in the exact same way as Bitcoin with the advantage being that you can broadcast the POW in constant time regardless of tx rates.

1. You're delusional if you think the entire network will go UASF. 
2. Your difficulty adjustment will take too long to matter. If you somehow manage to get 10% of hash power it'll take 20 weeks for an adjustment. Meanwhile you're mining blocks once every 100 minutes. Lul backlog. 
3. "fuck miners"! Ha! They've spent millions producing more and more hashes to secure your coins. See if they care if you fork yourself off the network and have no more confirmations for anything.

I think you missed my point.  These microblocks still have to have a block size limit.  But what is that limit?  1MB every minute isn't *that* much different than 20MB per 10 minutes.  You don't have the block (header) latencies but you still have chain bloat and bandwidth requirements.
@_date: 2016-05-08 13:51:08
There's not ever going to be a clear answer to this question but, I'll do what I can. 
1. Realize that you're never going to trust the code 100%. Even if the program is 5 lines of code printing "hello, world" you still have to trust the compiler, assembler, linker, libraries, operating system and hardware. You'll never be able to read all this code yourself. 
2. I follow the bitcoin core patches regularly. It helps me feel a bit comfortable with what's going on. 
3. Other people do too. If there's a bad thing that ends up being part of the code and I miss it, it'll likely be mentioned on the public forums somewhere. 
All in all, it's not a big deal. There are so many eyes on this code that if anything ridiculous is added, we'll know.

Right.  And...
You will want to reference the previous emporors microblocks because you get 60% of the fees and only 40% of your coinbase.
The paper mentions there will almost always be *some* micro blocks that are orphaned when a new key block is found.
Edit: also why wouldn't you update the prevBlockHash every time a new microblock is released? It's no different than changing the nonce in terms of randomness and you stand to make money by doing it.

This doesn't follow from your assumption.  If Bitcoin has widespread adoption with a low block limit size, you can easily assume the blocks would be full. And with only high-value transactions occurring (as the OP is assuming) then you're likely to have a lot of hashing power backing the network (because fees would be higher).  
With a lot of hashing power, it's trivial to set up a merge-mined coin with much larger block sizes.  There's no reason we couldn't have a fully utilized and vibrant Bitcoin with 1 MB blocks alongside CoffeeCoin that everyone uses for day to day transactions and yet still be secured with some large % of the Bitcoin miners' hashing power.

I think most sane people don't see these two items as incompatible. 
Larger block -&gt; lower fees. I think most agree on that point. Lower fees and more tx throughput probably means wider adoption. Wider adoption means more transactions. More transactions means more fees to the miners.

Absolutely not true.  You can buy CoffeeCoins and use them without ever having to transact in Bitcoins.  If Bitcoin is the world's high value transport network and CoffeeCoins the 1GB-per-block-with-low-fees layer, they can co-exist without you ever needing to use the other one.  *Some* people would transact on both. *Some* people will transact with institutions.  Neither are requirements.

Coinbase either does this themselves or hires someone who's better. But it works like this:
Coinbase (or hired company) sends a small amount of bitcoin to whatever gambling website and let's it sit there for some time. They monitor the money with an automated program. 
You also, at some point, send money to the same gambling site. Let's assume you lose the money. 
At some point in the future, the gambling website moves all funds from their hot wallet to cold storage, or they pay out a big winner or something that ends up collecting YOUR bitcoin AND coinbase's into the same transaction, thereby giving coinbase enough "evidence" that you sent money to a gambling service. 
They (coinbase) could also issue a withdrawal and if your address ends up as an input in the same transaction, they can make a pretty good assumption that you sent money to a gambling service.

However, an actual block size increase allows more transactions than that. The segwit discount gives what, 1.7x more transactions with 4x the blocksize. Whereas a "standard" 4x blocksize increase would give you 4x the transactions.

If you're a miner, trying to earn coin on the Bitcoin network, you need to take into account your network accessibility.  Mining solo behind a tor wall with a 50KiB downrate would be one of the stupidest setups I would ever hear of.
But maybe that's the point: that the block size effectively squeezes out people with inefficient hardware and network access. That's fine.  I don't see how that cartelizes anything, though.

The point is you need to trust a third party to give you the requisite signature **OR** you keep copies of those keys, in which case adds no better security than 1-of-1 wallets.

I didn't downvote anyone in this thread, even though I disagree with the majority here.  I want to get my voice heard on this, despite really not being a major player in the Bitcoin dev field.  Here are my thoughts:


This is true, however, if miners want the latest code and bug fixes, they will indeed need to upgrade.  Over time, most miners will. Miners will not be required to use any specific value for "non-standard" transactions, but the *default* value is an important number.


And **default** is the key word here.  *Most* installations do not deviate from the default.


And I call bullshit here.  The vast, **vast**, majority of the network will leave the default values unchanged.  That is, there's a 90% probability that transactions containing less than the 54ubtc output range will be dropped by your peers. **This is terrible**.


It does no such thing.  It draws mapping between the value of a transaction to the **size** of a transaction.  As any non-brain-dead Bitcoin developer would know, the value of a transaction plays zero baring in the size and importance of a transaction.  I could send 100k Bitcoins instead of 1 Satoshi in the same amount of bytes. I could include fees of high or low amounts in either transaction.


At whose discretion?  Gavin's?  It really shouldn't be up to him to "adjust dust settings".  This is noise that a free market is capable of handling.

You don't get to make this decision by defining a "social contract."  Human nature dictates that people will go for the profit motive, in general.  
So you must somehow use the profit motive to produce a healthy network.  Transaction fees do that.  Spamming the network with high fees costs money by the producer of those transactions.  Low txns will get ignored.  It's really quite a genius solution.

There were two common hash functions in the code: one that double SHA-256'd and one that did SHA-256 followed by RIPEMD-160.  My best guess is that it was convenient to just call hash(Address) to be more consistent with the rest of the code than to implement a third SHA-256-only hash function.  In fact, introducing that would mean you'd have to make a distinction between the double and single SHA-256 versions and could lead to various bugs down the road.

What is so hard to understand is why you would WANT to hand over trust to a third party to allow you access to your wallet! The *whole point* of Bitcoin is to eliminate third party trust.  It makes no difference whether there are 1, 10 or 100 servers, 2-of-2, 2-of-3, or 101-200 keys.  Multisig wallets offer no improvement to security, **whatsoever**.

This is where I think most are wrong on this topic.  The majority of miners and regular Bitcoin users will stick with the default Bitcoin-QT (or bitcoind) installation and leave most settings at their default.  Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think so.


Agreed.  Satoshi knew this way back when: the way to prevent blockchain bloat and network spam is DoS detection combined with a price to enter the blockchain--fees.

The masses won't be so inclined (or knowledgeable enough) to do this and I shouldn't have to go out of my way to send a transaction that the network can clearly support.  
IMO, miners need to base their decisions on fees and txn size and nothing else.  Relayers, also IMO, should only relay transactions they believe have a chance of being included in a block.

you should reread what I wrote.   Bitcoin addresses are hashes of public keys. Shor's can't be used to invert a hash.  Since the public keys aren't revealed until you spend, you've got nothing to factor.  This is why people recommend using a new change address for each transaction.

To be fair, I'm a programmer as well and read the actual source code changes to the client.

If the majority of users upgrade to this (which I suspect they won't, given the latest chinese download surge), then it would effectively cripple transaction outputs of a certain value (read: **not** size, which is really what's important).

    return ((nValue*1000)/(3*((int)GetSerializeSize(SER_DISK,0)+148)) &lt; CTransaction::nMinRelayTxFee);
Most transaction inputs are 148 bytes, tx outputs are 32 on average bytes.  If you were to output 1 satoshi (nValue=1) then the result of the division is roughly 1000/548, and that's far less than the 0.0001 min default requirement for relaying.  It's not until nValue=5480 that the comparison passes.  
It also kinda blows that the only values you can use for nMinRelayTxFee is 0 or 1 Satoshi -- which is kinda bullshit too since the variable name has *fee* in it and this compares nothing of the fees.

Because it is *very likely* most people won't change that default value, then it is *very likely* satoshi-valued outputs will not be relayed by a large fraction of the network.  **This is a problem.**
Not only does it cause quite a bit of strife amongst Bitcoiners, it doesn't address the *real* problem, and that is firstly, putting a price on relaying large transactions (something Satoshi never really mentioned) and secondly, dealing with data in the blockchain.
I don't think the second part is an issue - as the number of txns continue to grow, the price to get included in the chain will increase.
For the first I think that if relayers followed the same criteria as miners that things would work out just fine.

You know, I've already been contemplating forking Bitcoin-Qt, even at this point.  I hate the fact that some of the core develoeprs are bringing politics into a protocol that should remain neutral. Some points of note:
1. I dislike the idea of "standard" vs "non-standard" transactions. Bitcoin of the future shouldn't ever need to analyze scripts (except for user-friendly display for destination addresses).
2. LevelDB is pretty badly integrated, and there's no reason Bitcoind should be using it. Software is better when separated, so I believe bitcoind should be either dynamically linked against leveldb (so fixes can happen in parallel) or another system, like MongoDB, should be used instead.  BDB is also still hanging around for legacy reasons. 
3. Bitcoin-Qt should not exist in the same archive as bitcoind. Bitcoind should focus on being a production piece of software, the RPC command interface should be scrapped and replaced with a "libbitcoin" (analogous to how MySQL and mysql-enabled C programs work) and Bitcoin-Qt should be built on those libraries as a separate project.  Bitcoin-Qt is quickly becoming too many things for everyone and not really good at anything.
4. As *a* reference client, the code should be migrated to C-only over time, not C++.  In C, you gain the advantage of being ABI-compatible with nearly every other programming language out there.  C++, along with boost, have questionable performance.  The code is also in a pretty sad state of affairs: examine main.cpp and you'll see immediately a significant amount of global state, which is fine, but it isn't a particularly great either. And in main.h, you find a lot of classes that should have been split in separate modules long ago (CTxMemPool, CBlockFile*).
5. The fee structure needs fixing, BADLY.  The "dust" decision was mostly political in nature, included core developers value judgments about coin value and barely had any technological reasons for its implementation.  There's no reason why it hasn't been fixed already, Except that the core developers have been working on useless non-bitcoin-protocol code like:
6. The new payment protocol should **not be part of bitcoind**, but could be part of Bitcoin-Qt if, and only if, Bitcoin-Qt was separated from bitcoind as mentioned in point   
If bitcoin is to grow and prosper, it needs a client that is geared toward production systems.  These systems don't care if they have a GUI interface, QR codes, and others. They want a reliable, fast, neutral and secure implementation of a full SPV node without all the extra fluff.  
That being said, throwaway-o, if it comes to forking Bitcoind in order to maintain neutrality I'll be the first programmer to sign on board and work with you to maintain that goal.  I'm already quite familiar with the bitcoind code and development process.

It actually had to still be solved ("mined"). It's technically a block like all the others.

So where can I buy a copy of the book in pdf format using Bitcoins?

I'm in too!

No problem:)

So there is no problem, and the code need not change?

Suppose you could by a bond/CD with a guaranteed rate of return higher than the interest on your debt... Then no, paying off the debt is not the best investment.

Bah. A third party does not control your coins, but they can *refuse* a signature so that you *cannot* access them.
But of course you will reply with the ol' "then put more keys in a safe or on another server" to which I will reply **yet again**: there is no gain in security provided by this nonsense.


It's not my fault you can't read what I'm saying: I *never* said someone else could spend your coins.

No intrinsic value.  Pig intestine may be food, but I sure as hell won't eat it.  Water?  I'm satiated, thanks.  Value is what something is worth *to you* and you have no right (nor ability) to force your idea of value onto someone else.


Usually people ignorant of subjective value have to resort to name-calling because they've got nothing else worth saying. 
And for what it's worth, not **all** food is valuable to everyone.

As far as I can tell, there's no such thing as artificial demand.  Either things are wanted, or they're not.  
OK -- I'll be fair -- the only artificial demand that I'm personally aware of is the FRBNY buying US Treasuries with printed money.  That's some artificial shit right there.
Coins just sitting and appreciating is good for the people who will be using coins to buy things -- it's a positive externality on the entire network.  If person A's hoarding causes person B's purchasing power to increase, that's a Good Thing(TM).

In Japan, what do these machines look like and where can I find them? Are they just standard looking ATMs?

There is a risk the currency could crash tomorrow, in which case NOT paying off debt and buying something else would have been better.  Paying off debt IS slightly risky.

Exchanges are not full economies!  Fucking with liquidity on an exchange, or even multiple exchanges, doesn't have to have a huge effect on the full bitcoin economy.  People will value them and trade goods and services regardless of the exchange rate on gox.

Intuition isn't always the better choice. Sometimes the maths just don't lie.


Sure, why not?  You have a lot of choices to weigh when making decisions like this...

I'm sorry, what's a country again?  How do countries "do things"?  How does a country start a bitcoin organization?  
@_date: 2013-12-14 14:05:34
Exactly.  The fact that 64-bit cpus natively interpret 64bit numbers doesn't mean that computers can't handle bigger numbers. secp256k1 uses 256-bit private keys, and they work just fine.  The serialization isn't an issue either, since variable-size ints have been supported in the code since day 1. And anyways, only novice programmers use floating point arithmetic for money programming.  You should always use fixed point ints/bigints.

Is he?  I'll take note. Thanks:)

Do you know how many addresses start with HiMom?  I don't, but I'm guessing it's in the hundreds of trillions range.

You can claim it as yours for all it matters to me :)  I think that makes it public domain?

The IsDust computation uses a "Fee" variable to compare something that is not fees.  It's stupid code.
And other peoples' decisions will affect my (and your) ability to relay transactions.


They are points of failure.  Relying on specific nodes is a terrible idea.

Wow, thanks for that information.  I've never really been a fan of the EFF but it's good to have a legitimate reason for that dislike.

That's silly. If I hold enough keys to execute a transaction, how does this do anything at all for security?
I repeat: security theater.

Yeah, some guy put out a press release saying it was illegal.  It isn't though. His presss release didn't refer to anything official. And as you can see, other bitcoin businesses continue to operate. We have a number of reputable dealers on LocalBitcoins too.
