No BTC link ... It may have had a youtube link though now that I thin of it. Probably the reason, huh?

 it was removed because giveaways are against the rules of the sub and the sole purpose of the giveaway was self promotion  - - - - - Not the sole purpose, but okay, Ill take that one with a grain of salt. Doesnt everyone here self promote with predictions and "read my better statements" ... 
 something we only allow once per new business or major new product. You can see these rules outlined in the sidebar.  - - - - - - I did not make multiple posts?
Thanks for your explanation though

I understand the skepticism.  Ive been dealing with bitcoin related paranoids ( including myself ) for several years now.
But why delete the post based on skepticism? If thats the case every prediction thread should be deleted. Who can prove that the outcome of their prediction?

Simply put, Yes!
