Banks started out as forts where you could store your gold so people wouldn't steal it. They gave you receipts so you could redeem it when you wanted to trade for something. Then people figured out that it was easier to just trade the gold receipts. Thus paper money was born. The people running the forts figured out that since not everyone came in for their gold at the same time, they could print receipts for gold that did not exist. Thus began fiat currency.
When you store your private key with some central service they will follow the same path and bitcoin, or what they will falsely call bitcoin, will be just another fiat currency. I say if people want to store their bitcoins with some third party then go for it. I'm keeping mine. They will be real coins under my possession and control. I will come back here and laugh when you they get goxed.

Bitcoin is a virus

Hah, you just need to be persistent. The first time I installed Linux was on an i386 with 8M of ram via 42 floppy disks. A day later, after I booted the first time, I entered root at the logon prompt. After about a minute of chugging away, and before the password prompt was displayed, the logn timeout elapsed. There was no way I could even log in :-( After shelling out about $500 for 8M more ram I was able to finally log in. :-)

I remember the joke about Linux taking over the world. Some believed that but most were just having fun with the idea. But it happened in a much bigger way than anyone ever expected.

Why so many downvotes? Bitcoin is a virus that is attacking the government controlled fiat currency. It is a GOOD virus!
