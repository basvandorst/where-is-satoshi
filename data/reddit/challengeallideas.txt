Is this a serious question? Every government that has ever had a standing army has prevented it. How do they pay for that army? Through taxation.

Seems I was right, just a little bit off. *In fact*, things are worse than I predicted.

That's not really an answer. Yes, the threat of war is a cost of the state, but there's no denying that without a state violence becomes the only option, violence that you're not likely to be able to defend against on your own.

How do you prevent entities more violent than you from taking what you consider yours? 
Society is peaceful when the threat of violence exists and is held by a third party that only uses it to maintain that peace. You as an individual cannot stop a single person from invading what you call your own, neither can you stop a gang of 10, nor can you stop an invading army of 100,000.

Damaging how? You can't just make claims like that and pretend like it's true.

It's a stupid point. One is weak and fragile, and likely had to starve herself to get there. The other is gigantic, powerful, muscular. One is about destroying your body to look good, the other is about improving your body to look good. They're obviously not comparable to anyone with half a brain cell.

I did spend some to help me move when I got out. If I hadn't I would have hit the millionaire mark much faster.

Not sure if I want to put my face to it, to be honest it was originally a way to hide funds from a nasty divorce (ex was cheating on me while deployed).

I plan on donating a large amount to the wounded warrior foundation and red-cross, who helped many of my injured battles get messages home while we were deployed.

I think you just supported his position though; that bitcoin has no real value, that early adopters are the only ones who really profit (much like a pyramid scheme) and that it's simply a fad that will disappear (or be crushed by governments who see it as the threat that it is).

You should hope you're wrong. If it doesn't crash to 200 within the next week then it isn't going to get back over 1k for a very long time. 
If in fact it doesn't crash to 200 in the next few days, we will see a slow up and down that will eventually end up at 350-400 in a few weeks, from which it won't recover, and it will slowly drop over time to 200 or bellow. The market will never spike like it did this time because there is simply to much risk and too much history of risk - the perfect predictor of this is the emergence of hundreds of other forms of crypto currency. New currency at the moment appears to mean "new profits", and bitcoin, while still powerful, will become abandoned completely.

Yes, I predict 200 by the end of today. 2k by the end of next week (from people buying it at 200)
