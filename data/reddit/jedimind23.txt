Long ride for sure.

I can see why you'd say that.  If I had more to invest I wouldn't even have posed the question and would have jumped right in.  Since I don't, I'm mainly curious about forecasts of a retrace in which I could maximize what little I do have and get a bigger portion of a coin by timing my entry better instead of just jumping in now.

Thanks for the input.  I also believe in the technology..Though like you said, it's good to have a healthy awareness of the volatility we'll continue to witness. 
That's awesome that you get to use it for Chinese food, haha.  
I've done a good amount of research and it seems a pretty solid bet that it's going to continue to rise quite dramatically. 
Any thoughts on John McAfee's extreme predictions for 2020 of 500k-1mil? For 2018 I believe he predicts 78k by years end, which I don't think is too unreasonable.  I myself expect 40-50k.

I forgot, it will stay at a 90 degree angle with 1,000% yearly increase forever.

The price increase has been so dramatic, I just can't help but think we'll see a decent pullback in the near term future.  I'm used to trading forex which has some huge price swings, but percentage-wise, nothing like this.  It's uncharted territory for me.
 
In any case, I'll probably jump in.  If it goes to where I think it will, a somewhat better deal on entering won't matter, truth be told.

Well written and spot-on.  Anyone who's traded at any sort of serious level would agree with this list and have experienced the same lessons for themselves.  
I'm more experienced in trading forex than cryptocurrencies, but these ten things apply to trading forex just the same.

I am torn about investing now or waiting for a pull-back, profit taking, etc. to get in at a better price.  Of course it seems like now's the time because it's showing no signs of slowing down.  
I do believe in 2018 we will see quite an increase but I can't decide about how to time getting in in light of the upcoming CME and Cboe debuts and how that may affect price.
Any advice/input greatly appreciated
