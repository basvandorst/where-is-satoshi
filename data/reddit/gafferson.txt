The hashrate has consistently been above the difficulty throughout the life of bitcoin, so much so that we actually have something like 9 minutes 30 seconds block time on average.
@_date: 2018-01-11 15:21:33
Thank you. I feel like no one is even mentioning decentralization. It's like the initial principals of Bitcoin and the blockchain has been forgotten and it's just all about a viable currency.
@_date: 2018-01-10 05:36:11
Yeah it is, nothing wrong with it imo, just shows high demand.
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:24:38
Its worse than you thought, I believe the words were already scratched and revealed when he received it.
@_date: 2018-01-15 15:33:12
I think he has probably bought a lot, I have heard him say on an interview he recently sold more of his bitcoin for bitcoin cash. Someone has to keep the price afloat. 
Edit: good on you btw I dumped all at 300 on principal
@_date: 2018-01-10 03:28:08
It is the same hashrate, miners get new coins+fees for mining a block.
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:45:45
Yes I'm aware. I figure there will be much less on chain transactions going on, and the scaling is going to be a continuous journey, as it is with most things. Lightning, RSK, Schnorr etc are massive steps in scaling that will bring us into a new tier of adoption. Basically, we will cross that bridge when we get there I suppose, or not, time will tell.

Traders gonna trade. Have a heart, jesus christ.

The first two are similar issues, in which several innovations have recently been released. The third isn't an issue at all. Bitcoin mining projects are currently being set up which take advantage of excess power from hydro electric dams. This power is usually wasted because massive batteries are too expensive,  so in this way bitcoin essentially becomes a battery.
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:38:23
Lol you can't read the website. It has multiple outcomes.
@_date: 2019-07-20 03:10:14
Fuckin a that thing is beautiful.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:13:18
Sure, but even if some people started it would help relieve pressure and it would get the ball rolling.
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:17:11
Fwiw I did about 6 segwit paper wallets for Xmas each with about .003 and paid 4-5 dollar fees sending from a segwit wallet. Confirms in 8-12 hours. More fee than I would like but it did work!
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:50:18
Oh those are sick. Here's to hoping.
@_date: 2019-07-26 01:38:56
I believe he was only into gbtc so I'd guess that's probably easier to access as family... not sure though.
@_date: 2018-09-11 14:34:08
I believe he is saying it is centralized and changing major parameters of bch chain is a trivial thing to do.
@_date: 2019-07-24 19:32:29
Most important factor is your power cost
@_date: 2018-09-06 14:29:08
Also It was actually said by Royce Da 5'9".
@_date: 2018-09-01 02:38:37
I think it may be a double meaning, Royce da 5'9" is aka nickel nine. "Biting" in rap is a term for copying anothers style.
@_date: 2018-08-07 15:58:31
Take a look at some of the resources slepyhed has posted, very valuable information. We aren't going anywhere so take your time and learn learn learn!
@_date: 2018-05-19 16:54:48
That's what I was wondering as well, could be asic but that looks more like a gpu rig lol.
@_date: 2018-08-01 23:45:26
They covered the entire pole like they own the place...what a fitting metaphor.
@_date: 2018-05-30 19:34:43
You mean the plethora of upgrades that are being worked on as we speak? RSK, bulletproofs, etc. I'm not a dev just a curious holder, but what I see going on is real development on btc and a pack of lies and hype from most (if not all) other projects.
@_date: 2018-05-13 18:24:23
In other words, what is being held long term, but is not lost/burnt?
@_date: 2018-05-30 18:31:26
Mike got his come up from eth gains, I doubt he will see the light anytime soon.
@_date: 2018-05-24 03:33:39
Due to network costs... what do you mean?
@_date: 2018-05-22 15:36:11
Schadenfreude maybe?
@_date: 2019-03-01 22:41:49
That's the one.
@_date: 2018-10-24 23:57:09
Yeah totally, believe it's called better hash.
@_date: 2018-10-13 17:02:17
Not if you set it priced in btc instead of usd
@_date: 2018-10-16 14:08:46
But it is down about 75% from that snapshot to now if you set priced in btc not usd.
@_date: 2018-10-23 02:16:42
Are you implying he invented smart contracts?
@_date: 2017-08-16 05:58:56
Yeah wtf makes no sense, Forbes has a crypto podcast called unchained, which is pretty good actually, considering it's from Forbes. Its not like they are uninformed.
@_date: 2018-06-18 05:56:37
The block is like a train car, a new block is added to the end of the train every 10 minutes no matter what. Your fee determines whether or not you get in the limited space of the block, or if you wait in line until there is space for you on another block.
@_date: 2018-06-01 21:59:41
Same boat I'm in! I googled the definition (even though I thought I knew it) and I guess that means by digital decree basically? Guess that is accurate lol.
@_date: 2018-06-09 02:35:43
One great example I can give you is renewable energies such as hydro electric and wind/solar. These methods are common place but carry with them various issues, mainly that the power coming in varies based on different factors and storing the energy in a battery is too inefficient and costly to be worth it (in large scale, not a home). Bitcoin can become a battery for these companies/utilities. Assign any excess power to mining and use bitcoin to pay for power when you have a electricity deficit.
Another example is using wasted natural gas in oil rigs for bitcoin mining instead of literally wasting it.
Any who attempt to just set up a mining farm without finding every efficiency possible will be pushed out by those who are smarter than they are.
@_date: 2018-06-01 16:43:00
I know! I'm sorry! It does say digital fiat in the bottom right corner though.
@_date: 2019-08-09 01:47:37
@_date: 2018-06-26 14:42:23
My advice is to buy just Bitcoin as you plan to and try to spend time understanding the tech behind it. I would steer clear of most (if not all) altcoins, the space is frought with lies, and incompetence, finding an actual project is hard. If you must feed the greedlust in the shitcoin casino then keep a significant portion of your holdings in Bitcoin. Best of luck!
@_date: 2019-08-01 21:41:20
Wow how strange I thought this was a comic convention or something. The riot police dudes actually looked phased by this man's powerful force.
@_date: 2018-06-01 05:10:45
Digital fiat? Sounds so dirty, maybe I've just been trained that's a bad word?
@_date: 2018-06-02 04:14:03
Hmm very interesting. I will have to process this.
@_date: 2018-06-09 01:18:18
Yes it is amazing for the planet. It is causing an incentive to be as efficient as possible. It is causing gamification in energy like we have never seen before.
@_date: 2019-06-10 17:10:40
I thought we were all lunatics
@_date: 2019-04-05 20:00:58
Yeah that's true, he would have been a better character there instead of Vitalik.
Hal seemed to have a weird role in the cartoon actually, feel like he was kind of misrepresented.
@_date: 2019-04-05 18:40:07
I agree, although I did like the cartoon otherwise. Saw someone say it should have been Peter Todd, would have been much more appropriate.
@_date: 2019-04-20 15:07:37
Didn't Adam Back invent proof of work to mitigate email spam?
@_date: 2018-11-04 02:27:21
I believe it starts December 12th pending CTFC approval.
@_date: 2018-11-20 19:49:14
Basically yeah, some reckless savage started loading a bunch of channels with 20 btc each.
@_date: 2018-03-30 21:39:24
Refer to above.
@_date: 2018-03-30 21:35:01
Yeah, but I'm a brainlet.
@_date: 2018-02-17 22:56:11
They are having some kind of upgrade fork coin called Callisto coming early March.
@_date: 2018-03-30 21:03:02
This. I have learned when I see loose it doesn't mean the person is dumb, they just aren't a native speaker. Your good man I appreciate the post, lots of good info.
@_date: 2018-02-17 22:53:13
Roughly 55k per bitcoin for a 1 trillion market cap.
@_date: 2018-11-16 18:15:03
He did say "Predicate is a long and unfamiliar word so I called it script."  
Is this for Satoshi's sake or for others?
@_date: 2018-03-26 16:36:01
World Crypto Network has a lot of good stuff.
@_date: 2018-02-23 23:13:44
You may have already heard them, but Team Hodl has some pretty good rap also... 
@_date: 2018-02-23 22:09:31
Ode to Satoshi, anyone remember this? 
@_date: 2018-03-23 00:14:49
I usually look here 
@_date: 2018-07-16 19:02:52
Unfortunate last name of that business owner....sick hood ornament though ;)
@_date: 2018-07-12 16:19:53
Faster block time is not equal to better scaling...
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:34:48
Its a dangerous game. If you sell and btc continues going up you will have messed up further. Just hodl bitcoin and literally forget about it til 2020.
@_date: 2018-04-30 23:30:56
Was some of that due to shifts in btc price? Too vague using usd.
@_date: 2018-04-27 17:28:42
Not sure what you really want people to tell you, seems like you want to hold, and so you should. Only really you know if it's financially feasible.
@_date: 2018-04-20 15:41:10
It's a metaphor.
@_date: 2018-02-23 23:05:24
Yeah love that.

It's just a seasonal cycle, come spring this baby will bloom again. Naddadimean.
