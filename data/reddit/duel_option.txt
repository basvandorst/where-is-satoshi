The problem with that type of thinking is that you’re only really seeing the issue from one side. 
For example:
Silk Road provides drugs to customer
Customer buys and used
Win/win as it’s one less Violent street crime. Saves tax dollars, and keeps the profits away from gangs
Another reality:
Silk Road offers bulk quantity items
Gangs cut product, and sell adulterated items at a cheap price
People get hooked to said product 
Families, women and children are affected 
You simply don’t realize the impact drugs can have. You’re whole argument is that it’s up to people to decide what they put in their bodies with absolutely ZERO understanding of addiction, poverty or education.
I support and use the darknet for personal use. But it’s laughable to say that it doesn’t affect millions and is a criminal activity.
Open your eyes a little

So what kind of verification are you looking for? Are you waiting for a collective of geniuses to tell the world this is the future?
By the time that happens, the price would be astronomical.
 
It’s up to YOU to decide if this looks like something the world can/will adopt. 30 years ago, people would’ve called Steve Jobs crazy thinking he could redesign the telephone and people would drop their palm pilots for an apple phone. 30 years ago, people would’ve called Elon Musk an idiot for thinking he could create 100% electric vehicles. 
If you would’ve invested in those companies at the start of their business, you’d have a hefty sized chunk of change. But EXPERTS weren’t telling you that then. Nor are they telling you bitcoin is the FUTURE now.
Convince yourself yes or no. That’s what really counts.
