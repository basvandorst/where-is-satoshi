AS a Venezuelan: Everybody in Venezuela is buying Dollars. Dollars are the best investment in there because our hyperinflation. Oil and imports are bought with Dollars. Nobody is hoarding Dollars. People here are using it as a de-facto money to be exchanged to Bolivars.
The fact that people are actually using Dollars and not HODLING it forever is what makes it a nice, useful currency.

Yeah, because the powerful/oligarchs/corporation are shitting their pants for a coin that's probably going to be worth peanuts in 2-3 years...

Take as many loans as you can get, mortgage your house and buy all the dip you can. HODL for as long as you can until you get evicted. This is good for Bitcoin!

Is not that Venezuelans are using BTC as currency. There a lot of miners there that made a big, quick buck, but nobody is using it as a currency, specially when the internet there is so shitty and black market dollars are more accessible and not dipping its value.
Así son las cosas...

A currency accepted only by the darknet and a handful of indie coffee shops is hardly what you call a "globally dominant in the currency world".

You can store your value on bitcoins and realize you have way less by next year.

Nobody is going to pay you for being a technology holder. Once you see past that you will then fully understand you lost money.

Yeah, we should wait two months more until it gets -40%.

Bitcoin will die when there's no buyer that trusts its value enough to keep investing in it, which is close to what's happening now. The moment you see everyone HODLing, not investing, not selling, the market will stagnate until loses any importance to other investments.
Bitcoin won't die per se, but its value will become negligible.

Don't panic. I won't be selling even at 1000$. I am in the 10 million debt club.

Lies! There are like a dozen indie hipster coffee shops around the world the use it... oh! and the dark web. Bitcoin is stronger than dollars. Case closed.

Thanks for this post. I always wanted to get rid of money but burning cash is not cool enough.
