See you at USD 3500. Never catch a falling knife!
@_date: 2017-08-15 06:16:39
A correction is more than due. That being said, after we passed USD 5000. ;-)
@_date: 2017-08-19 12:37:20
Double-bottom reached. Time to buy back in!

Last time that guy tweeted about crypto, prices crashed on the next day. Market top in? ;)
@_date: 2017-08-14 12:20:11
Now that would explain why they insist on small blocks. ;-)
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:41:23
And another option if you're willing to throw some cash at it:

This:

Don't listen to concern trolls. :)
@_date: 2018-06-15 04:06:23
Besser wirds nicht. Was sollte man denn erwarten dürfen? ;-)

Never experienced that before. I don’t even see where one could register a node on earn.com
@_date: 2018-06-16 05:25:27
Okay, I know that one. But that doesn't make you part of the earn.com network. It's just a possibility to query if your node can be reached by any other node. No harm in entering your IP there. I'm also doing it regularly with no side effect.

Miners will not be stupid enough to jump onto the BCash chain, just because Jihan &amp; Roger have pumped it for a few days.

Just add uacomment=&lt;cmt&gt; to your Bitcoin Core config file.

Other resources:
Google it, a lot of tutorials around
The Raspberry is though DAMN slow - the first sync of the Blockchain might take literally forever. So maybe perform the first sync on a PC and then move the storage with the blockchain already on it to the Pi.
You can also buy a preconfigured full node at Bitseed:

Should be happy that he didn’t fall for Bitconnect (yet) ...
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:18:05
Not really. Justice! Www.mtgoxlegal.com
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:10:22
Never trust Roger. He‘s got plenty more in the stash. Place a buy order at a cheap price. You might get rewarded in the coming weeks.
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:37:20
Let's buy his coins at maximum discount later today. He's gonna get rekt.

Next stop 21 club!
@_date: 2018-03-13 10:18:33
FUD. A civil rehabilitation is the most likely case from now on.
@_date: 2018-03-13 10:52:14
Jup. You can join mtgoxlegal to know more
@_date: 2018-03-12 16:03:04
According to those data none have been sold yet. Strange ...
@_date: 2017-09-26 13:50:59
FUD post.
@_date: 2018-03-13 06:48:34
Just go on Mt.Gox com and read the official documents
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:49:29
I am not. Still waiting for my money from GOX. lol
@_date: 2017-09-25 16:05:45
Bad news time over - time to buy back in ��
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:27:06
This is gentlemen!

If  tries to sell the fakecoin as Bitcoins, he'll get into deep trouble. Sure there will be more than one person suing him in Japan.
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:35:24
Roger would make a good villian though ;-P
