buy in a exchange then, better to be safe. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:51:10
ikr, totally bummed me out
@_date: 2017-10-19 18:00:47
of course all tranfer is wallet to wallet but that are companies that does that for you. like u pay money and than they deposit bitcoin in your wallet with fees of course. i thought those fees were the only one
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:11:16
good time to buy that's for sure!
@_date: 2017-10-24 21:17:32
no because the fees are only a small percentage
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:05:37
ikr, i never trade or anything, i just hold, but i enter the coinmarketcap every single day to see the prices
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:39:16
there is no transfer fee when you deposit in another people's wallet. it makes sense just as paying with regular cash
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:45:01
i'm trying to learn, that's why i asked
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:04:25
no we would value like we value current money, if you current currency is dollars for instance, you probably think that a new t-shirt is 10 bucks. if bitcoin tottally replaced it people would get used to think that a t-shirt is 0.0.. something bitcoins
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:48:52
most exchanges do ask for documents, that's normal. but wallet to wallet transfer don't require any documents at all
@_date: 2017-10-18 15:12:16
ikr, i'm enjoying it
@_date: 2017-10-24 23:43:23
it's gonna go up for sure, as long as you don't struggle with your current &lt;40% you're gonna make money
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:30:44
hopefully :)
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:48:47
hmmmm i see, but what do they want to infer by refering it as a buble?
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:28:33
@_date: 2017-10-19 18:29:43
to the miners that proceed the transfer in the blockchain
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:48:26
what's a tulip mania?
@_date: 2017-10-30 15:54:45
buying from other people or exchanges
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:00:23
yes, bitcoin is limited to 21 mln, somebody can easily start another criptocurrency with the same features, and if it got popularity, it would compete as an equal
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:11:28
just put it on google drive and that's it
@_date: 2017-10-24 19:59:44

@_date: 2017-10-20 19:13:19
nowadays bitcoin is closing in 6k, u make money by buying it and waiting the price to go up. or you can trade, buying cheaper and selling a little bit more expensive.
