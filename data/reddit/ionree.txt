Came here to say this. It's remarkable how three hundred years after the first true bubbles the scheme is still always the same.
Fundamental premise of technical analysis is the fact that markets always repeat the same patterns. Turns out that that's still true over the course of three hundred years of innovation, including the cryptocurrency revolution.

Looking at the history of this years rise and how the market reacted to 2X, I think we have encountered a peak for now. Then it's just a matter of applying a classic head an shoulder model and some fibonacci spreads. Then at some point we will get 2X 2.0, but this time properly, which will give us a nice boost and future stability. After all, the bitcoin price will be based more and more on fundamentals as the crypto market matures, and since massive circulation is pretty much the only thing that legitimises bitcoin, solving the scalability problem will definitely help.

We shall see.

Nah I'm mainly alts, only doing btc to snatch some side profits when I see a quick rise or drop. Made good money off of 2x.

The guy is too smart not to see the obviously improbable. He probably just has personal interests in popularising Bcash.

In three years, there will be 18 million bitcoins in circulation. If each bitcoin is worth half a million dollars, that makes 18e+6 *.5e+6 = 9e+12 dollars.
The GWP (GDP of the world) was [$75.59e+18]( in 2013. Assuming 3% growth per year, that makes approximately 75.95e+12 * 1.03^(7.5) = $9.48e+13 by 2020/21.
This means that 9e+12 / 9.48e+19 = 9.5% of the GWP would be in form of bitcoin. That seems unreasonable.
More interestingly, consider the amount of money that would be replaced by bitcoin:
The global supply of physical money (M0) is roughly $5e+12 (i cannot find any better source than [this]( and am too lazy to do the math myself). Thus, bitcoin would make up almost twice as much as all current physical currencies.
Including money stored in bank accounts (M1), we get a global currency of $25e+12. Thus, bitcoin would make up 9.48e+12 / 25e+12 = 37.92% of all global currency plus digital money on all banks' servers. That seems unreasonable.
Basically, we will most certainly get to see McAfee eat his dick on national television.

Remember to correct market cap with price increase. If the price of btc increases simply through high trade volumes, then so does the market cap. This however doesn't give you any long-term indicators. What really matters is the effective amount of backing that BTC has, which has gone up significantly (doing some back-of-a-napkin math by ~40% over the last couple months) but not quite trippled.

I don't mean to offend, but let me be brutally honest: If you got into bitcoin in Q3 2017 without being fully aware of it being a bubble and having an according exit strategy, then you are in no position to make better investments elsewhere. You will end up loosing even more.
If you can afford to HODL for the next couple of years, you can almost certainly sell at a profit. If this is not possible, get out at the next uptrend, because it's only going down ever so slowly from here for the foreseeable future.

Yes, simply scroll back in time on the bitcoin chart to the last time we saw a somewhat comparable pattern, or look at any bubble ever.
The only debatable thing here is whether bitcoin is dead or not. Considering how a major factor in the buldup to the bubble, namely fees and delays, is slowly being solved, I believe bitcoin will see a nice comeback in the future.

And I (partly, and certainly not for that kind of 'reasoning') agree. I think you misunderstand what I said.
