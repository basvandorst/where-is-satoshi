Perhaps the hacker was able to change the limits too. In any case looks like BitGo's security model is flawed too.

He's acting exactly as Gavin had described him. Touchy and quick to anger. Wright is Satoshi. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:00:00
According to this it's 125K BTC. 
That's a 1/5th of Gox

Yes they do still stand by what they said. Gavin only said he regrets making his blog post. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:01:46
They got access to the offline keys too. 
Finex said BitGo wasn't compromised. That means the 2 keys they hold were.

Actually no. When people get that emotional and stay that emotional it means they're saying the truth.    
There's a difference between being defensive with logical arguments or responding with emotion. The latter implies honesty. Craig is Satoshi.

He has proved it, just not publicly. 
He has absolutely no desire to prove it publicly. 
@_date: 2016-08-25 17:30:33
He controlled all the keys though
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:07:29
Sounds like an inside job. Ultimately such hacks are impossible to prevent.
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:03:21
Other than that he proved it to Gavin and John Matonis. And other early adopters say it's him too. Must be a big conspiracy.
Just because he didn't prove it the way you want doesn't mean he's not Satoshi. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:30:17
They were all multisig wallets with 1 key offline. Hence likely an inside job with someone able to gain physical access to offline keys. 
(BitGo held the 3rd key, but apparently they're not compromised)
Alternatively, someone was able to hack in and also able to fool BitGo to sign off on these transactions.
@_date: 2016-08-25 17:28:35
Because the alternative requires technical know-how that most people don't have. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:36:28
Could be they dont have enough in their hot wallets to handle withdrawals so halted trading?
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:07:10
That's what I thought at first too. But according to Zane, the offline keys were not compromised, which means the hacker was also able to fool BitGo to sign off on all the transactions.

Just what I was thinking. Also can't you essentially do this with Coinbase too? Although the denominations may be in bitcoin, don't remember. 
@_date: 2016-04-05 18:49:36
I'm not saying it won't--it's just that it's not enough for mass adoption. I don't know the numbers in terms of how long payment channels are expected to stay open for, but let's say on average they are open for 48-hrs. And say the entire bitcoin is devoted to LN Even in that case, there can only be around 350,000 payment channels open at any given time (assuming opening and closing requires 1 transaction each). That's not enough for a global payment network. 
Again I think LN is great. Just saying it's not the end of the story. 
@_date: 2016-04-19 02:48:44
Can someone bring me up to speed on how SegWit is  allowing such large blocks? I thought the blocksize is capped at 1MB, and only the number of transactions squeezed in increases with SegWit. 
@_date: 2016-04-05 13:32:54
Coinbase or Circle or Gemini. 
@_date: 2016-04-24 04:42:34
Perhaps the 600,000 gox coins. 
@_date: 2016-04-05 15:51:48
LN can't actually make this happen. It can only scale the number of transactions per user, not the number of users.

Really is mind-boggling that he thinks money today is already digital (and the laughter from the interviewer!). We have digital accounting, nothing more.

My favorite wallet is Copay. 
Other popular ones are Mycelium (for android) and Breadwallet (for iOS). Try them and see which you like best. 
I don't know which of those (if any) allow you to add a watch-only address, but with Copay you can create a multi-sig wallet so your coins are very safe. 
@_date: 2015-12-09 22:45:14
Not true. They need to keep 0.1 bitcoin per share. 
@_date: 2015-12-08 14:18:12
But the price is going up, so there's more demand than supply. 
Also since buying/selling on localbitcoins is at a premium, it's unlikely the same coins are being recycled. I would think the vast majority of coins being sold on localbitcoins come from outside localbitcoins (during a bull market), ultimately coming from miners.

You don't need a bank account. You just need a wallet to hold your bitcoins. Copay is my favorite. The ATM sends bitcoins directly to your wallet. 
Note that bitcoin ATMs have a high fee and most only let you buy bitcoins, not sell them back for usd.

Coinbase and itBit are the most reputable and 40,000 is a drop in the bucket for them. Gemini is trustworthy too, but 40,000 might possibly be too much for them to swallow in one go. 
I don't know about escrow services. I would contact itBit and see if they could help. Coinsetter is another reputable option. 
The rub is that since all the exchanges have to follow a lot of compliance it will take some time for them to trust *you* and ensure you're not up to something shady. That's why a phone call will speed up the process. 
@_date: 2015-12-06 22:37:31
Not to side with GS here, but my understanding is that with SETLcoin the trade is the settlement too. Private blockchains are missing quite a lot, but not that.

You might want to explore bitcoin from the perspective of a country without a stable currency like Argentina. Check out the books Digital Gold and The Age of Cryptocurrency which talk about this. The books themselves are a little light (esp. Digital Gold), but they have both thorough bibliographies which would give you a lot of leads.
@_date: 2015-06-11 16:03:09
Youre hypothesizing too much when you don't need to. Why not check their website and compare their spot price to Bitstamp? You may still have a valid point but some real numbers would help your case. 
It looks to me they are making nothing, but I don't think they're losing money per trade. They likely have various hedging contracts set up among all the currencies. They're paying out of their own pocket for these contracts, but prob don't care how much things move around internally.

If you're near a LibertyX location and willing to buy $50 worth, then go with that. Cheaper, easier and safer than localbitcoins.

@_date: 2015-12-01 16:50:34
If you're in the US, LibertyX is by far the best option, but it's a $50 minimum. Otherwise google for a Bitcoin ATM but those have 5-10% markup. Or localbitcoins if you don't mind a little more legwork.
@_date: 2015-12-27 01:47:30
There is no transaction fee when sending from circle or coinbase. Or rather they pay the transaction fee for you. You should see the exact bitcoin amount show up in your wallet. The dollar amount is likely less because because circle is using a slightly higher exchange rate. This is how they are able to offer "free" bitcoin purchases. It's not free--they're hiding it in the exchange rate. 
@_date: 2015-12-06 13:49:02
I agree. I meant to say that those who bought at 800 aren't getting rich by a rise to 650. 650 isn't so high when you consider bitcoin was once almost double that.

It might be they only hold small portion of fiat. Since they only move in or out BTC, it might make most sense that they're just keeping nearly everything in BTC, and just have separate contracts to hedge against the other currencies.

And who's the Oswald in this case, Karpeles? So has he even been charged with stealing the coins? The fact is there is 0 evidence that points to him. There is 0 evidence that points to anyone at least publicly. 
So yes all we are left with are conspiracy theories. A government coverup is not that far-fetched when you read the stuff pulled by the corrupt DEA and SS agents in the Silk Road investigation, especially considering they had some links to Mt. Gox. Fact is the same agents that were interacting with Karpeles, stole around a $1million of bitcoins from Silk Road. Have you read that criminal complaint?

If you live near a LibertyX location, try them. They're the fastest, cheapest and safest way to get bitcoins.

As others were saying, try to do as much of the demo before your talk. Here's what I would do:
* send them an email to download Mycelium (or whatever), set it up, and email you back *their* bitcoin address
* send them each a couple bucks before the talk 
* at the talk, show them on blockchain.info a transaction you made to one of their wallets 
* now that they all already have loaded wallets with many confirmations, show them how to spend bitcoin
* for this I recommend everyone donate a dollar to United Way:  (perhaps send them this URL in your initial email, or you can google "united way bitcoin"). What I like about United Way is that they don't ask for any information, so you really get to experience the ease and speed of bitcoin. Also it's a charity, so you get to show bitcoin's good side ;) You can mention Greenpeace, American Red Cross, Wikipedia etc accept bitcoin just like this too.
* Perhaps show a transaction to United Way on blockchain.info too. I think it's important that to an AML crowd they see the openness of bitcoin transactions. Perhaps even include a slide on how IRS Special Agent Gambaryan Tigran uncovered 2 corrupt federal agents (DEA and Secret Service) by plotting their bitcoin transactions  They're now awaiting trial. 
Good luck!
Edit: just want to add if you do the united way demo, then by clicking on the QR code it should pop open Mycelium. Or you can have them buddy up and 1 person scans the code on the other's phone. What's cool about this is they can both immediately see United Way showing "payment received". And the notion of person making a payment on someone else's phone with just a scan is pretty revolutionary.

Longer chains always win.
So with 51% you are *guaranteed* to get a longer chain over time. You can do it in secret for months and then publish it. All the other nodes will have drop their chain and adopt yours. 
Say after a month the network has created 4300 blocks, but you have (in secret) created 4400 blocks. Not only are you 100 blocks ahead, but you could have really messed things up with all 4400 blocks (like having them all empty of transactions).
@_date: 2014-11-24 16:24:28
Used it 4 times with great success. Almost too good to be true. Started with 14% off, then 20%, then 25% twice. Never had to wait more than 15hrs, although your reputation grows gradually so if you start with trying for 25% off you might have to wait a while.
My only problem with it is that likely there is some fraud going on, but probably not much more than Amazon has to deal with in general. BUT don't buy Amazon gift cards, because if it does turn out to be fraud, Amazon can revoke their value weeks later and you'll have no recourse. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 02:35:24
Well said. 
Charlie Shrem commented last week that he's having a lot more OTC clients that want to buy than sell. Assuming Shrem's not lying or unique, then there's actually more demand than supply out there. It's just the big players / Wall St. types not wanting to go through an exchange and drive the price up. On the flip side they must be doing as you suggest selling on exchanges to push the price lower. 
Unfortunately the market cap of bitcoin is tiny (~5 billion) compared to what's going on Wall St e.g. $220 billion Alibaba IPO. Big timers won't pick up the phone for a trade less than $100million. Bitcoin can't accommodate that (yet). Stand strong my brothers and sisters and wait for the tide to turn.

Many bidders went though Silbert's group, i.e. someone can place a bid for 100 btc (or maybe you needed to bid on a whole lot of 3000, not sure) In any case there was only 50,000 on offer so there'll be a lot of losers and likely a high winning bid. This is just 1 syndicate-- there are many others, Draper's group, Pantera etc.

Nah mon. Nothing conspiratorial about someone trying to buy $100m worth of bitcoin and doing it smart to save $50m. Anyone but a saint or a moron would do the same. The bitcoin market is tiny--easy to manipulate. ($4 billion bitcoin vs. say Alibaba $220 billion)
Sometime trying to get out doesn't (1) dump 30000 at 1 price (2) go through an exchange (3) and put up and down the wall --are they selling or not?

It's clueless "experts" like this that give me even more confidence in bitcoin. 
He a says the blockchain is great for remittances / currency conversion but bitcoin itself doesn't have to be worth anything. Explain dear sir how this is possible? You're saying I can put in my $1000 onto the blockchain (by exchanging it for bitcoin--which you argue can be worthless) and be able to take out euros on the other side. Pray tell how I exchange these worthless bitcoins for euros of value.

It's a lot of fun, and we're going to do it again tomorrow morning (Mon 8:30am) in Rockefeller Center. Message me if you can join us--could definitely use more people. We can cover the bitcoin cost.
Also thinking that It would be cool to turn this into a global event of handing out bitcoin in the streets everywhere, and we can have a website where we upload videos of us doing this. I registered the domain bitcoininthestreets.com (BITS) for this and plan to make it open for anyone to post their YouTube videos. (Btw, if you can help me with the website, let me know. I can pay you in bitcoin.) Let me know what you think!

Not sure how you would monitor for this. Hypothetically, say North Korea wants to do this. They can make their own ASICs, get whatever power etc they need under the radar and then unleash it when they're ready. Personally, I don't think there's motivation for them (or anyone) to do this today. But not hard to imagine in the near future.
Once it happens, it's too late to do something about it. People's confidence in bitcoin will be destroyed.
I'm not trying to be a downer, but think this should be high on the list of protocol changes to make such a possibility much harder. There's plenty that can be done to fix the situation.

One guy asked me if he can see one, because he was curious what they look like. ;)
The thing is, those that stopped already had some notion what bitcoin is, so they we're just asking basic stuff like how are we sending them the bitcoin, etc. 
Most people (90% I'd say) have never heard of bitcoin so aren't even interested in stopping. They think we're handing out trinkets or something. We even had to modify our sign to say "free money". Of course we're only showing those that do stop in the video.  
Then there's the case where you have an educated older gentleman who's never heard of it but really curious. And I try to explain it, it's potential, but there's no way to do it without sounding like a madman lol. It's very frustrating. Like imagine someone telling us of all the power of bitcoin back in 2008. We'd think they're nuts too.

The thing about Shrem is that it's not just his opinion. It's his personal experience. Say what you will, I don't believe he's lying, nor is he unique in these claims. The OTC market is strong and transacts more bitcoins than all the exchanges. BitPay, Coinbase etc they all deal OTC.

They should have contacted HIM. 
Coinbase can't just go cancelling orders at the whim of an algorithm. That's pretty entitled of THEM. They're not a free service. 1% in fees adds up to a lot of money and to have a flagged account reviewed by a human before canceling is the least they can do.
I speak as someone who has had similar experiences with Coinbase and have probably sent over a dozen emails to them about canceled orders. Yes they're very helpful over email, but why should it even get to that point?? It's totally out of proportion. Especially when you consider I've paid them hundreds of dollars in fees.
@_date: 2014-12-19 16:00:52

Crux of it is selling on exchange which causes downward pressure, and buying OTC which doesn't have the equal effect of upward pressure. 
People have figured out how to use this detail to their advantage. There are books on this. Works best in the bitcoin world because OTC transactions don't need to be reported and there are always miners that must sell out necessity.

Decentralization allows for platforms like Changetip to emerge. Ultimately I think there will be many more centralized services "plugging in" to the bitcoin backbone, especially when sidechains are implemented. So it's the backbone that's decentralized, and you're probably right, not very good to use for microtransactions directly.

You're safe with Circle no? It's insured against widescale hacking/theft and if you have a strong password + 2FA you're protected against individual hacking. 
I use Coinbase's vault. Seems almost impossible for someone to get to. Granted you still need to put some trust in these companies, but still better than the alternative of paper/hardward wallets imho.
Xapo is another good choice too.

Circle seems to me would be more vulnerable since they don't have the fraud detection systems Amazon has (although one day I hope they will). Also with Amazon the scammer has to ship to an address that doesn't match the credit card's--red flag. And Amazon still has a few hours at least to cancel order before shipment. Circle doesn't have that cushion.

I agree still a ways to go before bitcoin is mainstream. The average person on the street barely has any idea what it is. I was in a (hip) coffee shop this morning that uses Square register and I made a comment, "cool you use Square--I heard their next version will be able to accept bitcoin payments." And she said "oh god I hope not! I'm not ready for that." She was panicking like it's some complicated payment system she's going to have to learn. 
Although I admit the change will likely happen fast and furious. Like the way Facebook, Twitter exploded really fast once they hit critical mass.

Oh yeah this seller made a really bad bet, underestimated people's demand for $300 coins and got clobbered. But in general this is how in breaks down.
OPTION 1: 
BTC price $600, buy all $80m at that price = 133,333 BTC
OPTION 2:
a. Buy $20m at $600, sell them off at exchanges pushing price down from $600 to $300. Say average sell price of $450. Taking a loss of $5m. $15m left over.
b. Once price is at $300 buy in $60m (yes I'm assuming lots of liquidity here, but the point is that this heavy buy is OTC so won't have a equal effect of pushing the price back up to $600 or above) = 200,000 BTC
c. There's still $15m left over at the exchange, which can be used to push price back up to $600. Say average buy price is $450 = 33,333
Yes, I'm oversimplifying, glossing over a lot of details, but in this scenario it's 133k BTC vs. 233k BTC.
@_date: 2014-10-21 22:17:05
Yep and they can add with $1 you could buy 2.5 milli-bitcoins
Aghh nevermind. We need to change the terminology. 
@_date: 2014-10-03 18:18:52
Personally I don't buy the argument that merchants don't hold so there's extra sell pressure. Merchants like Dell, Expedia never really have bitcoin in the first place--everything is handled on the payment processor side. People pay e.g. Coinbase which pays Dell. Essentially this is an off exchange transaction (sometimes off blockchain transaction). Maybe not exactly, but shouldn't affect the price any. 
The only way it does affect the price is if people are spending their bitcoin and not replacing them because they believe the price is dropping anyway--again playing the trend in a way. I'd like to hear if people are doing this too.
@_date: 2014-12-24 02:04:52
Yes they let coinbase pay them in dollars while you pay coinbase in bitcoin. But as a consumer I get my product either way so I'm happy. The more merchants that do this, the more useful my bitcoin.

True they can make 2 accounts. I'm suggesting they only allow the bonus to work once. So if you buy 5 bitcoin with a fee then you can buy 5 bitcoin without a fee if you spent the 5. Bitcoin received/purchased without a fee wouldn't entitle you to get more without a fee.
Also I would point out Coinbase has pretty strict controls over having multiple accounts. I've learnt that the hard way when my phone was listed as a backup number to my Mom's and brother's accounts (I set it up for them). They locked down all 3 accounts until we verified we're 3 different people.

they're manipulating the market. gearing up to buy boatloads more OTC at the reduced prices. prob some hedgefund or bank making a big play. this is no bearwhale trying to get out. 
for a number of other reasons this reeks of manipulation. 
all you can do is take advantage of the situation and buy that whale down. worse thing for anyone to do now is sell

More like the money is lost on the price drop of bitcoin, not on the purchase itself. Although I agree it costs money (~1%) to get more bitcoin. This I believe is the root of the problem.

Transferring it electronically still usually involves physically shuffling/transporting money somewhere on the back-end. And you need to trust your bank/government to do this--that's another story.

It's harder than you make it out to be. We already have better alt-coins yet they can't overcome bitcoin's lead and they're losing ground every day. 
Initial distribution of coins is a BIG problem too for any future alt currency.
Microsoft sunk $250 million into X.25 in the 90s because they felt it's better than TCP/IP. They were right, it is much better. But TCP/IP already had it's grip. As does bitcoin now.

Hmm good points but not convinced it's an even wash. The way I see it
(1) Yes they're bidding against each other but not to the levels that would happen on an exchange where there are many more players. 
(2) They could, but even the early adopters, the ones flush with bitcoins don't have the muscle to play the game the way Wall St. investors can. I mean some of these hedge funds can buy all of bitcoin, lock stock and barrel.

How can you say it's easier for a scammer to use Purse.io than Circle? The scammer isn't dealing with Purse they're dealing with Amazon, one of the largest retailer--and tech company--in the world. They likely have the most sophisticated fraud detection systems out there (besides the credit card company themselves). Circle doesn't have a fraction of Amazon's sophistication (although one day I hope they will). And a couple more points: On Amazon a scammer is shipping an item to an address that doesn't match the credit card--red flag! Also Amazon has hours or days to cancel the order before shipment. With Circle it's instant.   
@_date: 2014-09-29 19:33:27
Um, I don't buy that argument. How is Circle any less susceptible to credit card fraud? If anything Purse.io is more protected--since you're not using your credit card on Purse but on Amazon. And Amazon probably had the most sophisticated anti-fraud detection systems out there. Not to mention it's not instant like Circle--they have a few hour window at least to cancel the order.

Wall St. Journal
WASHINGTON—A U.S. Senate report on commodity-market activities at big Wall Street banks accuses the firms of being so powerful they were able to influence prices, gain trading advantages and put the broader financial system at risk by entering volatile businesses such as uranium trading and coal production.
The two-year, bipartisan probe by the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations is the most extensive look at how banks like Goldman Sachs Group Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. and Morgan Stanley built up voluminous inventories of aluminum, copper and other commodities. The report said the banks often exceeded regulatory limits on the size of commodity holdings. It portrays banks straying far beyond their traditional business lines to dabble in lucrative but risky activities that posed legal and financial threats to the firms.
The findings are likely to put additional pressure on the Federal Reserve as it considers whether to restrict or reduce Wall Street banks’ role in physical commodity markets. A two-day hearing on the report begins Thursday, with Fed Gov. Daniel Tarullo expected to testify on Friday. The Fed, which is reviewing its oversight of banks’ commodity-market activities, declined to comment.
The banks identified in the report said they adequately manage risks of the activities and don’t use their commodities business to gain an unfair advantage. All three firms have moved to reduce their commodities holdings amid congressional and regulatory scrutiny.
The Senate report also depicts the Fed as failing to stop the bank buildup of commodities, allowing firms like J.P. Morgan to hold assets well in excess of allowable limits. The Fed restricts commodity holdings to 5% of a financial firm’s high-quality capital, but the banks used loopholes to hold far more, the report said. At times, the report said, the Fed was simply unaware of how much oil, aluminum and copper banks were stockpiling.
Investigators found J.P. Morgan exceeded restrictions on copper holdings by defining it as a precious metal despite its widespread use in industrial applications and exceeded aluminum limits by holding it as an asset of a subsidiary instead of the parent company. Precious metals are exempt from a federal rule that only 5% of banks’ financial trades can end with physically delivering a commodity. Morgan Stanley held 55 million barrels of oil-storage capacity, enough supply for nearly three days’ worth of U.S. consumption. Goldman, the report said, engaged in “merry-go-round” transactions involving aluminum for its own financial gain.
The report also cites a previously undisclosed Fed staff review that in 2012 recommended higher capital requirements for big banks engaged in commodities, closer monitoring of those activities and tougher reviews of whether the activities were actually complementary to banks’ normal lines of business. The Fed hasn’t identified how it has implemented any of the staff’s recommendations, the report said. The Fed earlier this year asked for public comments on changes to its commodities policy.
The report didn’t offer an overall estimate of profits the banks made as a result of their physical commodities holdings.
Democrat and Republican lawmakers said the report shows additional restrictions are needed to rein in Wall Street’s role in raw-materials markets. The report recommended a series of actions that could shrink bank trading and strengthen oversight. While none of the activities highlighted in the report appear to be illegal, officials said they hadn’t yet decided whether to refer certain matters to enforcement agencies.
“We found substantial evidence that these activities expose major banks to catastrophic risks that are poorly understood,” said Sen Carl Levin, (D., Mich.), who chairs the subcommittee and will hold the two-day hearing. Executives from Goldman, J.P. Morgan, and Morgan Stanley are set to testify. “They are raising costs and uncertainty for the end users of commodities, which hurts American manufacturers and consumers.”
Officials are concerned banks’ ownership of volatile commodities poses risks to the firms and the financial system, saying a catastrophic event similar to the Deepwater Horizon explosion or the Exxon-Valdez tanker spill could expose a bank to legal and reputational risk. As liabilities mount, lenders and trading counterparties could withdraw credit and refuse to do business with the bank, posing a risk to the entire financial system given the size and scope of big Wall Street banks.
The Senate report focuses heavily on events that led to a 2010 logjam in wait times to remove aluminum from Detroit metal warehouses operated by Goldman. In September 2010, wait times at the warehouses began to spike to unprecedented levels of as much as two years, which the report said led to a supply shortage that drove up aluminum prices and prompted complaints to lawmakers from major aluminum consumers like MillerCoors LLC.
The report points to agreements between Goldman’s warehousing subsidiary and Deutsche Bank AG , London metals hedge fund Red Kite Group and Glencore PLC, a Swiss mining and trading company. Goldman gave the companies incentives to sign contracts to keep their metal inside the warehouse system—increasing warehouse revenue for Goldman and benefiting its trading position, the investigators found. Under the merry-go-round agreements, the metal would merely be transferred between warehouses.
In a report posted on its website Wednesday, Goldman said the activity at its warehouse reflected the desires of its financial-market customers and didn’t affect aluminum prices or the availability of aluminum to the broader market. Goldman is now pursuing a sale of the warehousing firm, Metro International Trade Services. Representatives of Deutsche Bank and Glencore declined to comment. A portfolio manager at Red Kite couldn’t be reached for comment.
The report said Deutsche Bank executed the first such deal in September 2010, asking for delivery of 100,000 tons of aluminum in a single transaction. The amount of metal was the largest withdrawal in the history of the global market for physical metal at the time, and 80 times more than the usual daily flow out of warehouses in the area. The wait time for clients hoping to get their metal ballooned from 20 days to four months.
Senate investigators pointed to weak oversight by the Fed, which they said allowed companies to hold commodity assets well in excess of regulatory limits. J.P. Morgan’s physical commodities holdings as of September 2012 were at least $17.4 billion, or about 12% of the high-quality capital it had maintained to absorb losses and avoid needing a taxpayer backstop, according to the report. That was more than twice the 5% regulatory requirement.
J.P. Morgan circumvented the rule “by excluding and minimizing the value of various assets,” the report said, adding that the regulations are “riddled with exclusions, poorly coordinated, and currently ineffective to protect taxpayers.”
The Fed’s legal department hasn’t objected to J.P. Morgan’s capital calculation, the report said. In a summary of its testimony to be delivered Thursday, J.P. Morgan said it has “robust risk management” in line with Fed rules.

Nope. 
It's Wall St. gearing up to get in on bitcoin my friends. 
These are powers greater than exchanges, miners, bitwhales etc.
Before they make a big play--I'm talking $100s of millions--they're depressing the market. 
Here's how it works:
1. Hedge fund or bank wants to put say $80 million into bitcoin
2. They buy $20 million OTC
3. They sell that off on exchanges at opportune times to create downward momentum
4. They buy in with their $60 million OTC at now 50% lower prices
5. They push the price back up on exchanges with the cash from their dumping manipulation
Wall St. is waking up to bitcoin. See e.g. 
Also Charlie Shrem and others are reporting more OTC demand than supply. What does that tell you?
EDIT: Adding this too

@_date: 2014-12-07 19:32:22
A few that reasons that come to mind:
Sometimes they sell your physical address too so you get more junkmail to your house.
Say I buy some sex toys and then when my daughter is using my computer I don't want her to see ads for sex toys or porn sites. There are many other examples like this. Like I intend to marry my girlfriend and buy a ring and then my girlfriend uses my computer and sees all these bridal ads and realizes what's up.
But there are deeper issues. For me, I'm just against advertising altogether. I wish there was a way for me to opt out entirely. Like pay a fee so I never have to see an ad. I don't understand why sites like Twitter don't have this option. Anyway, by allowing advertising to be more directed and more personal I am contributing to the "added value" of advertising. I want no part of it. And now Mastercard is selling the data behind our backs, really turns me off. 
There are many more philosophical arguments like this that are too long too get into.

Credit cards, bank transfers etc is not electronic money. When you pay someone with a credit card you are sending them your *credentials* electronically to withdraw some amount from your account. This is different from actually sending the money directly in number of ways. I'll list a couple. 
1. The receiver needs a separate authorization or relationship with your institution. If they live somewhere where they can't connect to your bank, credit card, or even to paypal, then they can't get at the money. Just imagine you have a friend from Lebanon come visit (as I've had) and you wanted to exchange money *electronically* with them, how would you do it? (hint: PayPal doesn't work in Lebanon)  
2. You have to trust them to not withdraw more money than you are authorizing, and trust them to keep those credentials safe. I remember when online shopping first started people thought it was literally insane to send credit card info over the web. Now we just shrug and think it's no big deal.

Agreed. The main issue here is that not enough people are getting paid in bitcoin. There's then a cost to spending it if you need to then re-buy on Coinbase with 1% fee. You can't expect people to spend bitcoin if effectively they're losing 1% on their purchase. Personally I'm often willing to take the hit, but it's not sustainable. 
I commend Overstock for their plan to pay bonuses to employees in bitcoin. We need more companies to start doing this.

In Gavin's own words, a 51% attack could "effectively stop all payments and shut down the network"
And according to James D'Angelo it won't necessarily be obvious it's happening until it's too late, if the attacker includes most transactions.
 
Even if 1% of transactions are left out, or even delayed a few weeks, that would be the death of bitcoin.

You admit then these satoshis have enormous intrinsic utility, moreso then gold or dollar bills. Keep in mind that the number of them is limited.
Consider this: A person in year 2020 has say $1m sitting in the bank. He converts these dollars continuously to satoshis to launch various services on the blockchain. Quite likely he will wake up one day and think "Why am I storing my money in dollars, where its value deflates, its value is tied to the health of the US economy, when I can just keep them in 'a shit ton of satoshis'." What happens when everyone has this same thought? 
Well it's starting to happen already and that's why the market price for a satoshi is now roughly $0.000004 . Pretty cheap imho. 
You can argue well you can make many many other blockchains. Bitcoin is just 1 of many. That may be true, but there needs to be enough miners supporting your new blockchain, and they need incentives to do so. I.e. the currency itself must have some worth. This is a very hard problem to pull off. Many have tried and failed. Once bitcoin's place becomes even more assured, it will be nearly impossible to replace it on a general scale. Like the other--and better!--web technologies that tried to overtake TCP/IP and failed.
I rambled there at the end.. as I tend to do when comes to bitcoin.

If there's a bitcoin option I use that. Just bought a Double Robot this week with bitcoin, which was cool because they sent me Coinbase invoice by email that has a link to make payment. 
In general though bitcoin really turned me into a much bigger saver. Quite frankly I didn't save much at all pre-bitcoin.

Thank you for the honest reply Erik. I see your point, but what happens if the market cap increases dramactically along with its overall integration with other services/technologies? Will the hashrate increase proportionally? Seems at that point to kill bitcoin will cause a lot of destruction. 
It there some official discussion where this is being addressed? 
@_date: 2014-10-06 12:52:01
Dude, this has been happening since bitcoin was in the $600s. Every time there's been upward momentum (e.g. PayPal), someone puts up huge sell walls on BitStamp, if you follow the order book. 
They don't need to buy the $60 million overnight (I'm not clear how you got to $100). Once the market is depressed for a while--like it has been in the $400 range--you have weeks or months to buy in at lower prices. 
@_date: 2014-09-21 00:01:31
haha. thank you!
@_date: 2014-10-06 04:54:07

Dude, no need to look at the blockchain. Just look what's going on on BitStamp today someone putting up a 30,000 BTC sell wall at $300 (yes 30,000!). Someone trying really hard to keep the price down. Tell me that's not manipulation.

Where does everyone keep their paper wallets? This is the biggest issue for me. You obviously need a couple safe locations. Other than hiding it at home, I don't know where to store it. I don't have a bank safe deposit box, and keeping it at work is really not ideal. Also what happens in a Katrina scenario where I have to evacuate my area. So really you need to keep a paper wallet in different cities. Seems like a lot of work.
Then there is another issue I have with paper. If something should happen to me--I want my family to be able to get my bitcoins. They know how to get to my online passwords, but having paper wallets that they can access is also tricky.
Coinbase vault is most practical for me. I trust them.
@_date: 2015-05-07 15:30:04

Yes exactly. Don't know why most people seems to ignore this point of an attacker "mining in secret". Hell, for all we know there could be a 51% attack going on right now. (Not that I believe that's so.) 
@_date: 2014-12-25 17:22:19
I did this once. Gave someone a paper wallet and instructions how to import it to a blockchain wallet. I checked it 6 months later and funds were still there, so I swept it. If she ever comes back to me, I'll give it to her again. But for now I don't want it to end up lost as has happened before. 
I no longer give out paper wallets because of this. Only email via Coinbase.

$20m on exchange, $60-$80m OTC. 
Unfortunately when OTC deals are made the parties look to the exchange price, but untimately the exchange price does not reflect the real demand. The difference is that on the exchange you see the actual bids and asks. OTC it's not advertised.

Bitcoin slips through all this regulation (for now). They're doing it while they can. 
See link Charlie Shrem's post. Good stuff. The point is that most trading is happening off exchange. So the exchange price is not a good barometer of bitcoin's true price.
EDIT: Also in the stock market OTC deals must be reported. Not so for bitcoin.

People made that same conclusion last time and lost. The thing is you can be right 9 out of 10, but you just need 1 big player to think market price is fair and clean up. Not so easy anymore getting this much over the counter. The OTC market is pretty close to spot. Plus the winner here gets an extra bonus of notoriety. Tim Draper is more well known for his win last time, for better or worse. In fact I wouldn't be surprised if he took it all again, just to make a point.
But I admit I'm no expert on game theory.
@_date: 2014-12-26 20:38:46
I think the power of bitcoin is that it's a **universal** open standard, one that no one owns. Most likely our everyday "bitcoin" services will be centralized, like changetip, but they'll use the bitcoin backbone to transfer data between them. It also makes it much easier for new financial services to be built because it's open to everyone without the need for permission. 
In this way bitcoin is like the internet. There were better communication networks at the time TCP/IP was introduced, but they were closed proprietary platforms. Every new entrepreneur that needed a network, chose the internet because it was available and free. The same goes for bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-21 12:35:19

Say denying 1% of all transactions. That's all it would take for everything to crumble. 
ie say someone runs a 51% attack for a month, generating blocks at a faster rate leaving out 1% of all transactions, and then exposes this longer chain. Once it becomes known people's transactions are gone, all faith will be lost.

Agreed that at this point the payoff of destroying bitcoin is not worth the investment. But in a year or 2 when bitcoin is say 100x it's current worth/utility, then a bad state might find it attractive compared to other warfare investments.
True, *most* of the coins don't disappear. Except the coins from the mined blocks while the attack was underway, since the attacker gets all the mining rewards from his longer chain.
@_date: 2014-10-06 03:13:31
Manipulation. 
Here's how it works: (1) Hedge fund or bank wants to put say $80 million into bitcoin (2) They buy $20 million OTC (3) They sell that off on exchanges at opportune times to create downward momentum (4) They buy in with their $60 million OTC at now 50% lower prices (5) They push the price back up on exchanges with the cash from their dumping manipulation or just wait for it to go up naturally.
Wall St. is waking up to bitcoin. See e.g.  Also Charlie Shrem and others are reporting more OTC demand than supply. What does that tell us?

Great writing. Reminds me of the opening to Karl Ove Knausgaard's "My Struggle". 
For the heart, life is simple: it beats for as long as it can. Then it stops. Sooner or later, one day, this pounding action will cease of its own accord, and the blood will begin to run toward the body's lowest point, where it will collect in a small pool, visible from outside as a dark, soft patch on ever whitening skin, as the temperature sinks, the limbs stiffen and the intestines drain. These changes in the first hours occur so slowly and take place with such inexorability that there is something almost ritualistic about them, as though life capitulates according to specific rules, a kind of gentleman's agreement to which the representatives of death also adhere, inasmuch as they always wait until life has retreated before they launch their invasion of the new landscape. By which point, however, the invasion is irrevocable. The enormous hordes of bacteria that begin to infiltrate the body's innards cannot be halted. Had they but tried a few hours earlier, they would have met with immediate resistance; however everything around them is quiet now, as they delve deeper and deeper into the moist darkness. They advance on the Havers Channels, the Crypts of Lieberkühn, the Isles of Langerhans. They proceed to Bowman's Capsule in the Renes, Clark's Column in the Spinalis, the black substance in the Mesencephalon. And they arrive at the heart. As yet, it is intact, but deprived of the activity to which end its whole construction has been designed, there is something strangely desolate about it, like a production plant that workers have been forced to flee in haste, or so it appears, the stationary vehicles shining yellow against the darkness of the forest, the huts deserted, a line of fully loaded cable-buckets stretching up the hillside. The moment life departs the body, it belongs to death.

Imagine for instance you have a colored coin representing the deed (your ownership) to a $20,000,000 building. You own that coin, you own the building. Say someone just sold you that colored coin for $20m, but then uses his massive computing power to undo that transaction. Effectively stealing the property back.
In game theory modeling with regards to bitcoin itself this won't happen, because someone with that much computing power would presumably just use it to earn bitcoins instead. But with this colored coins example, there is no such incentive. 
I think OP raises a very good concern. It may mean that colored coins won't be able to be used solely on their own for very valuable assets.

Also the perception of Coinbase is that they're the most trustworthy, considering that they have NYSE and BBVA investment, A+ insured, Gavin Andresen is an advisor, etc. Sure, your info would probably be passed on the the US govt in a heartbeat, but you can be sure you're covered in a hack or loss.

The mining company should just say hey we know there's ~50 ounces of gold this spot, and start auctioning it off. This saves on the extraction, refinement, transport and storage vaults. The massive savings in the "production" could be used to guarantee against inaccurate deposit estimates.

Ethereum crowdsale offered 1BTC = 2000 ETH irregardless of the USD/bitcoin price.
Similarly crowdfunders on Swarm (e.g. swarm.fund/project/coinspace ) are looking to raise 250 BTC. No dollar exchange rate comes into play. 
We're going to move more to fixed BTC as it becomes more stable.

That's true although I haven't found the difference that large--with Circle you're still paying about a .8% premium in my experience. And hey, Circle should do the same I suggest. 
At the very least least these companies should offer lower fees the more you purchase. People would be less reluctant to spend if they could buy back with lower fees.

I agree the crowd was very different from the usual suspects. There also seemed to be a big group of high-schoolers, or maybe college freshmen. Def on some kind of school thing. 
I was sitting next to an older woman (in her 60's or 70's) that said she's been reading about bitcoin and came to find out more. She was really on the ball and asked me a lot of good questions. Even taking notes during the talk!
I thought it was really good discussion especially for beginners which I think probably half the audience was. And no mention of Mt Gox and that stuff until someone brought it up in the questions. 
The best part was getting the inside jokes, like Gavin's reference to 21, where half the audience laughed and the other half sat their confused as to what they're not getting.

I commend you for making this post. I too have had problems with Coinbase and after I cleared everything up with them and had my account "whitelisted" things were fine. For a month. And then I got canceled orders again. Needless to say it's very frustrating especially when the price goes up (I think almost every time). But all I can do is email and be very courteous and walk with my balls between my legs because I'm so worried to not mess things up with them. (This was before Circle)
I understand they need to err on the side of caution and need to really play it safe and a lot of that is not their fault. But considering we're paying them 1% --that's a lot of money!-- they need to do a much better job.
Especially in cases like yours, when you're a long time customer, they owe you the courtesy at least of having your account reviewed by a human, and then call you about any concerns they have. Just canceling orders at the whim of an algorithm is just not right. They need to change their behavior and a post like this is the only way to do it. Ignore the commenters saying you should have called them. No, they should have called YOU. Attention needs to be drawn to this issue. I pay coinbase in fees more than I pay on my cellphone bill, my metrocard, and my Netflix combined. It's a lot of money. The service should match that.    
@_date: 2015-05-21 00:53:23
I think you're right--it would be very unlikely someone would be able to pull this off in practice. They would probably need to do a 51% attack and simultaneously gain control over (hack) the agency issuing the colored coins. Versus currently they only need to gain access to the issuing agency. Like the titling system in Guatemala.

Some people would argue all Facebook /Twitter has is a slick user interface. But not going to get into an argument about that. 
There are many many huge holes to be filled in our currency / banking system. And if I may be so bold I'll say in a couple years from now you'll look back and say I don't know how we ever got on with those ridiculous credit cards and paper money. Yes credit card fraud, stolen numbers, needing to punch in your credit card number &amp; address at every new site, needing to run to the ATM to get cash because some restaurant you're at is cash-only. Needing to go to the bank to deposit a check (as I needed to today). I mean these are just the minor mundane things. Yes PayPal can do some of this if everyone was on board with it. But bitcoin does it better. 
Once we start getting in the big things like remittances, micro-payments, b2b, g2b, other tech built atop the blockchain then things start getting really interesting. You may say this doesn't concern you, but just think of the international exchange you do have to do when you travel--the task of getting local currency and the then coming home with extra leftover. Imagine a world where bitcoin is used everywhere. Credit cards help but especially outside the US they're not used that much because they're quite frankly expensive for the merchant.

Does the sun have intrinsic value? I get the argument that the sun only has a utility to us (all life) on earth, but valueless to anything outside our solar system.

Keep in mind a transaction is only signed if it makes sense to move the coins i.e. it matches the orders on record.
Now BitStamp AND BitGo would have a copy of those records and would only sign if it all checks out. So stealing the private keys from one or the other would get a hacker nowhere.

**Many advisers lack the knowledge needed to guide their clients successfully in Bitcoin-related investments**
*Voices is an occasional column that allows wealth managers to address issues of interest to the advisory community. David Berger is the founder and CEO of the Digital Currency Council in New York.*
Bitcoin is a rapidly emerging asset class, one that people are interested in both because it has the potential to change the world for the better, and to provide a significant return on investments. Yet not many financial advisers have the knowledge base necessary to guide their clients successfully in Bitcoin-related investments.
In my previous capacity as CEO for the Americas at Campden Wealth and the Institute for Private Investors, I observed that high-net-worth investors and their advisers are especially eager to learn more about Bitcoin, but they don’t know where to start.
I founded and now lead the Digital Currency Council, a New York-based organization that offers online and live training, as well as professional certification, in digital currency for financial advisers, attorneys, and accountants. We spoke with hundreds of financial managers from large wirehouses and boutique firms. They helped us to identify the core competencies advisers should have if they want to help clients interested in Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is a technology as well as means of exchange and store of value. Advisers need to understand the technological underpinnings of Bitcoin, as well as how to hold, securely store, and utilize it. Advisers also need to understand the digital-currency ecosystem and the ways to evaluate risk and invest wisely within that ecosystem. They should familiarize themselves with the financial and tax implications, as well as the legal and regulatory issues—all of which are developing daily.
Adding to the complexity of learning about Bitcoin is the fact that there are many ways for investors to gain exposure to this asset class. These include holding the asset directly, investing in registered vehicles that hold the asset, investing in businesses in the Bitcoin ecosystem, becoming a limited partner in venture funds that hold these businesses, or trading on the price volatility of the asset. There are also new products being developed that will provide exposure, including at least one exchange-traded fund that is expected to be publicly listed in 2015.
Advisers who want to get educated about Bitcoin have plenty of options, but they should be discerning. There is no shortage of educational offerings from firms looking to sell a particular financial product, but those offerings should be evaluated through that lens. Advisers should ensure that any information they find online is independent, relevant to their profession, and up-to-date. Bear in mind that once you understand the fundamentals of this new asset class, you will need continuing education to stay on top of the latest developments.
Bitcoin investments today remain part of the high-risk allocation in a portfolio, but it is up to the adviser and the client to determine how much of the pie it will represent. That makes it all the more important for advisers to learn how to guide their clients responsibly. Those advisers that take the time to get educated about Bitcoin today will be the leaders of tomorrow.

Some people can do something like that. Buy BIT, wait a year, then sell GBTC. With 130% return that's a pretty good deal. 
Edit: Since I'm being downvoted I suspect people don't know what BIT is, or that when I say "wait a year" think I mean you're locked in for a year. That's not the case. If bitcoin shoots up 300% in 6 months and you want out, just sell your stake in BIT. It's a win-win.

When it comes time to pay your credit card, that's a push transaction too. In this case your credit card company is trusting that you're going to pay.
With bitcoin I believe there will be a service like this too. It may be Coinbase itself will have an option where they would pull from one of your bitcoin accounts whatever is needed to pay certain merchants (perhaps you specifically allow certain merchants with a cap per month). Maybe they'll even pull the amount directly from your linked bank account. Maybe if you're a user in good standing they'll even extend you a line of credit per month. 
I know all that doesn't exist yet, but it's likely coming soon.
Another option what Uber can do is extend you the line of credit themselves and you pay up at the end of the month. Just like you pay your phone bill or cable or electric.

This is good for bitcoin the currency. Very good. They are using small amounts of bitcoin in their implementation. 
Some may make the argument that since it's such small amounts it won't affect the price of bitcoin in any significant way. But while that may be true from a supply/demand perspective (debatable), it ignores the *intrinsic* value now bestowed on bitcoin. Bitcoin is now the oil that allows these other systems to run, a digital good (that cannot be arbitrarily manufactured) necessary for various functions. Now bitcoin becomes extremely attractive as a store of value.

I agreed with you in theory, but in practice it's hard to envision how they'll pull this off. 
Let take the use-case of having a blockchain to enable peer-to-peer payments (other use cases are less interesting). Off the bat this will not really be a global system. Countries under western sanctions, rouge states, questionable businesses, etc will be denied access, as obviously such a system will not be anonymous (for many reasons, one being they'll never make a system where payments cannot be reversed, which requires knowing the parties involved). 
Now there is going to be debate as who deserves to get access. Does China and Russia get access? A marijuana dispensary in Colorado? Etc etc. 
tr;dr Technologically it can be done and will have advantages. Politically it will never get off the ground.

I agree with you--just need some more clarification for my peace of mind. Say for argument someone is able to modify and lengthen the blockchain (suspend disbelief here). Now the miners and full nodes would have to accept/switch to this longer version, no? And this one has extra bitcoins going to a hacker. So how exactly would this be detected?
@_date: 2015-05-29 15:45:15
Agree, it's very rare. But it's happened a few times. 
I hit the lottery a couple weeks ago when I was in washington dc. Met a woman outside a coffee shop. She had only vaguely heard about bitcoin but was curious (she asked--I was wearing a bitcoin tshirt). She totally got it right away! We talk by email now and not only did she go through the Khan videos but is plowing through the cryptography and number theory. Obviously she's a rare person. Turns out she worked for the air force, military intelligence, Arabic translator, insanely high MENSA, DLAB, ASVAB scores. So she's way ahead of me. It's funny (and humbling) because I was spoon feeding it to her at the beginning until I figured out that she's smarter than me.

I wouldn't say it's irrelevant because bitcoin is also used as a store of value/asset class. So we can't ignore these uses which is actually bitcoin's largest use-case today. Tens of millions are being exchanged daily on the exchanges, we can't discount that.
For comparison, look at gold with which virtually nothing can be bought with, although a small amount of gold is used in drug transactions. This by no means discredits gold as a drug currency.

I too was in for a nasty shock the other day when I went to "withdraw" bitcoins and got hit with the .5% fee. But crap I wanted to withdraw asap after reading a post on r/bitcoin how they can become insolvent overnight. The comment that really got to me was one saying Halsey Minor just set up Uphold as a way to effectively "short" bitcoin without incurring any risk of losing funds in some Mt. Gox scenario. And this made perfect sense. Fact is they are taking a lot of the btc customers hold there and investing it in other assets. I.e. they're a fractional reserve taking people's btc, doing other stuff with it, and hoping bitcoin crashes so they can pay back lower. 
If bitcoin skyrockets that will be the end of Uphold.

Sure, although in terms of the "survival" of sufficiently complex systems it's negative feedback loops that are the stop-loss triggers allowing the system to survive. A rising price in bitcoin only helps it survive better. 
However, if the price of bitcoin were to rise too fast and aggressively then a negative feedback loop would kick in to protect the larger financial system as a whole. That is, if bitcoin were to grow so fast to dramatically upset existing financial systems, governments, or even societies, then *something* would kick in to knock bitcoin down. This is looking at the cybernetics of the financial system as whole. 
In fact, if I take another puff of this joint, you can say banks have become too powerful and threatened our society as a whole, and as a result bitcoin arose to knock banking down a notch, again, a negative feedback loop.

By PAUL VIGNA
Updated Jan. 20, 2017 9:08 a.m. ET
The race to get a bitcoin exchange-traded fund in front of retail investors heated up Friday, when a firm run by technology entrepreneur Barry Silbert filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to list its Bitcoin Investment Trust on the New York Stock Exchange.
The move by Grayscale Investments, a unit of Mr. Silbert’s Digital Currency Group, could expand the audience for the fledgling virtual currency if the fund is approved by the SEC. It also could prove an early test for how an SEC run by a Donald Trump appointee will greet innovations that may raise investor protection or other market-structure issues.
Bitcoin Investment Trust, first launched in 2013, already trades on OTC Markets Group Inc.’s over-the-counter exchange, OTCQX. With the new filing, the trust would operate as a traditional ETF, meaning that specialized traders would create and retire shares based on demand. These traders, called “authorized participants,” are pivotal players in the ETF market and keep ETF prices aligned with the value of the assets they track.
Two Wall Street firms, KCG and Wedbush Securities, are in discussions to serve as authorized participants, according to the filing. Additionally, the fund’s trustee will be Delaware Trust Co., and the transfer agent will be Bank of New York Mellon, according to the filing.
Grayscale Investments declined to comment.
The benefits of being first on a major exchange could be big, assuming that bitcoin does manage to establish itself as a viable asset class. The SPDR Gold Shares ETF launched in Nov. 18, 2004, and has $31 billion in assets. The iShares Gold Trust ETF launched on Jan. 21, 2005, and has $7.7 billion in assets. Gold, a commodity not backed by any particular government, appeals to investors for some of the same reasons that bitcoin does.
In addition to Grayscale, two other groups are seeking SEC approval for their bitcoin ETFs. Winklevoss Capital, the firm operated by twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, has been trying since 2013 to get approval for their bitcoin ETF, the Winklevoss Investment Trust. The SEC is expected to make a decision on it by March. Additionally, another group, SolidX, is seeking SEC approval for its bitcoin ETF, which also would be listed on the NYSE.
In recent weeks, trading in bitcoin has been volatile, with prices helped by uncertainty following the 2016 votes in the U.K. and U.S. This month, concern about Chinese demand hurt bitcoin, with the price sliding to near $900 from more than $1,100.
Some have taken to using bitcoin—a virtual currency backed by algorithms rather than pledges from national governments—as a hedge against dollars, euros, yen or yuan. But it largely has remained a niche product popular with technology hobbyists and coders, partly because of cybersecurity concerns among firms who deal in bitcoin.
The goal of a bitcoin-based ETF is to offer an product that will be easier for investors to access, and will mute at least some of bitcoin’s volatility—though not all, meaning it is still a riskier investment than other ETFs. “It appears there is significant pent-up demand from the investment public for such a vehicle,” Needham analyst Spencer Bogart wrote in a research report earlier this month.
But he also added the probability of one being approved in 2017 was very low, expecting the SEC could be cautious about such a risky asset.
Initially, the trust will seek to launch with $500 million, the filing said, though the target is subject to change. As of Dec. 31, it had about 1.8 million shares outstanding. Based on a net asset value of $89.39 a share, its assets under management totaled $164.2 million.

The blockchain holds the money and the 3rd party arbiter releases the money. This is far better then the system today where the arbiter holds the money too and can walk off with it 
Also it allows the 2 parties themselves to trust each other in a transaction by placing money in a blockchain "holding cell" thereby circumventing traditional escrow.

Why I like copay:

5. Allows you to start using without backing up. Ideal for introducing bitcoin to new users.

They're both very good. Digital Gold is more of a human interest story getting into Ross Ulbricht and Karpeles. Age of Cryptocurrency does some of that but goes more into the tech and even has a chapter on "Bitcoin 2.0", Ethereum, self owned cars, etc. DG is a breezy fun read, AoC explains more what bitcoin is and how it's going to change the world.

1. Stuff going on Wall St., Nasdaq, Blythe Masters' Digital Assets Holdings (what are they up to anyway??)   
2. Bitcoin-spinoff Ethereum  and the myriad startups building on it, ConsenSys is one   The vision is that eventually the 2 blockchains will be pegged together. Most likely many many blockchains will be pegged to bitcoin. Sidechains and all that jazz.
3. Check out a bitcoin conference. If you can make it to this one you'll get a lot of leads  Or go to a BitDevs meetup to really experience what's happening.
4. If you want human interest stories/conspiracies there are plenty of those. Start with the book Digital Gold and work your way from there. Here's one: It's been over 18 months and no one knows where the 650,000 bitcoins from Mt. Gox went. We do know that Mt. Gox was bullied by 2 corrupt federal agents who stole over $1,000,000 from Silk Road. By luck they were caught with that. Is there more they weren't caught with? $600,000,000 can go a long way in a cover up.

 has an integrated solution with unocoin. But they only let you work in increments of $600 at a time. 
So you can send BTC to unocoin directly as much as you want, but as others are saying, don't sell it all in one shot because unocoin may not be able to handle that much. Sell a few thousand every few hours.
Do you already have BTC? You can use  for that. Although takes a few weeks till they increase your standing to purchase $20,000 at a time (once you're fully validated they have a $50,000/week limit). You can email them to speed up the process.

I guess I don't really understand how multisig works. When you share the *wallet private key*, does that mean that an attacker can grab that key and set themselves up as a copayer?
Do we need to assume that when the wallet key is created it's not on a compromised device?

One option would be to send a changetip magic url e.g.  This will prompt the receiver to create an account if they don't have one. This way they have a quasi web wallet with bitcoin.
Another option would be to send a coinbase invite with some bitcoin. Once they download the wallet and create an acct, the bitcoin will be there. 
Not exactly what you want but it's hard to create a solution without btc being held by a 3rd party web wallet anyway.

Algorithms that are O(n) grow linearly, while those O(n^2 ) grow exponentially so are not scalable. 
For instance if you have 100 rocks and you need to count them, say that takes you 1 minute. Now if you have 10,000 rocks your task just increased 100x, so it takes 100min. It's linear, no big deal. O(n). 
But if you task was to sort rocks, and let's say again it takes you 1 minute to sort 100 rocks. Then with 10,000 rocks it would take you 100^2 minutes = 10,000 minutes. (Assuming the sorting method mentioned in other comment). This is exponential growth. Not scalable. O(n^2 ).

I use onename.com for this reason. The only disadvantage is that you need to periodically update your address there, otherwise you run into address reuse which is not best practice. 
You could even post your address directly on your twitter or linkedin or whatever. 
Alternatively, as others were saying, send your address by 2 or more avenues: text, whatsapp, facebook, reddit.
Edit: I should add that technically Onename can get hacked with an attacker replacing everyone's address with their own. So using 2 modes of communication is best.

I use it as my multisig wallet. Very easy to use and set up. Since it's multisig I don't mind copying to clipboard / emailing, as long as no 2 backups are on the same system. Although im thinking to move to a 3-of-x multisig wallet to be really secure. 
What I don't understand is how does copay creates a multisig wallet without knowing all the keys themselves and without one of my devices knowing all the keys? Can someone explain this to me? On setup the primary (creator) device generates a QR code that other devices scan to join the wallet. What's in this QR code that allows another device to hold a key, without the key being revealed to the primary device? If my primary device is compromised at the time I set up the wallet, can't all the keys be stolen?

I don't think using a service like Coinbase is any more complicated than learning email. There was a time when that was scary to the uninitiated too. Also if you want to keep control of your own keys a multi-sig wallet like copay.io (BitPay wallet) is not very complicated. I think the average person can learn it.

Coinbase is one of the biggest most trustworthy bitcoin companies. They have over $100 million in funding from big names in silicon valley and banks and the NYSE. And your bitcoin is insured too.
Circle is slightly cheaper and faster purchase. But Coinbase has more features. I recommend trying both to see what you like.
With Coinbase or Circle though most people prefer to move the coins to a wallet under your complete control (coinbase actually does offer such an option too). There are many such wallets -- copay.io is very good. Again try a few (mycelium, breadwallet, coinkite) and see what you like.

Does that mean that if the attacker gets ahold of this "GUID" then they can presumably make themselves into a signer for the multisig address. Does this mean that when I set up a multisig wallet it must be free from malware, or otherwise it's still a single point of failure?

1 confirmation (around 10 minutes) is plenty safe. Someone would have to be very sophisticated and devote a lot of resources to undo that transaction. As long as you trust the person even a little bit, then 0 confirmations (instant) is fine. 
However you may not be able to spend the bitcoin till about an hour later, because some wallets wait for 6 confirmations till they consider it yours for spending. With 6 confirmations even someone with $1 billion of computing power cannot undo a transaction.

Bread wallet and Mycelium are very popular for iOS. I like Mycelium best although it's temporarily unavailable in the app store. I use the coinbase app too which is really nice and good for buying too.

@_date: 2015-04-30 14:58:31
Been feeling the effects of this all year :/
@_date: 2015-04-15 17:42:14
First I agree it's a huge blemish on Mycelium's part to release something with bugs--obviously the bugs are device specific and didn't occur on the developers phones, but yes they should have tested on a full range of devices. (However users should still have the backup seed to recover their funds on a computer. If they don't, then they're putting too much faith in their mobile wallets. The best mobile wallet can't protect against a lost phone.) 
 
My philosophy is that mobile wallets should be like pocket cash. For this Mycelium wins for me. Breadwallet enforces too much security which makes it cumbersome for me personally. For instance, they require you have a pin lock on your *phone*. This is a non-starter for me, because I prefer to keep my phone unlocked. They require you write your backup seed first before using which I can't argue with, but I like Mycelium's approach more because when I want to demonstrate bitcoin to a new user, writing the seed down first kills the demo.
To your point about iOS being totally different from Android I don't know, but they're still the same company.

Recently whenever I make a simple factual comment like "Square said they're going to integrate bitcoin in their next register" it gets downvoted.

Anyway I would say there's an increase in trolls combined with Coinbase news perhaps not seeming like fresh news to get the needed upvotes to counter it.

Since Western Union is doing international money transfer their compliance/regulatory costs are sky high. This includes the audits etc they're required that they're solvent--so that they don't just take in a lot of currency and go "Oops".
With bitcoin you're getting the "international" movement for free and bypassing a lot of regulatory headaches and costs. With time bitcoin companies may be under harsher regulations too, but in the future, as you mentioned, there'll be less need to convert into and out of bitcoin altogether. 
@_date: 2015-04-02 21:56:55
Yeah you're probably right. I'm also thinking if there's a real concerted effort (by a government etc) to destroy bitcoin, then it's still probably more likely bitcoin recovers instead of litecoin taking its place.
@_date: 2015-04-13 17:07:52
In general I find the article way too pro-WU, but I'll make a few specific points. 
1. The article states "Fraud is the major issue in the remittance industry (e.g., the case of “employee impersonation” at Xoom), but it is not clear why a bitcoin-based provider might be much better at preventing similar types of fraud." There are number of ways bitcoin services can be better at preventing this type of fraud, not least because they're inherently compartmentalized. So for instance a rebittance service in Mexico can't move funds to the Philippines. 
2. As [you yourself said]( rebittance services are currently in a regulatory grey area allowing them to avoid huge compliance costs. This doesn't need to last forever, just long enough to get people over to bitcoin.
And ultimately **the fact** is that *today* rebittances is much cheaper than any other alternative. I've sent money to Mexico using SendBitcoin.mx and it's a few percentage points cheaper than any other alternative.

I used you guys for the first time last week and thought it's awesome. I usually don't go to Starbucks because my tastes are too snooty for it, but went special to try your app.
I think it's so good that I'm going to pitch it whenever introduce bitcoin to friends because it's a real tangible benefit that most people can use today.
I think the design of the site is good, but it's not clear what happens if the page gets lost/refreshed after you load bitcoin onto it. If I go reload the page from my history would the balance still show?
Also as others have said having a short explanation where the savings come from would make people less leery, because it really almost seems too good to be true. (I remember reading somewhere that you work off the gift card market. But for someone unfamiliar with this market the discounts can seem really puzzling.)
@_date: 2015-04-23 14:55:09
Is that your feeling too?
@_date: 2015-04-15 02:16:03
The gift card market is big. There are other companies built around the same model. E.g. foldapp.com does the same for starbucks offering 20% off and they deal exclusively with gift cards. Meaning they buy people's gift cards for something like 75 cents on the dollar and then make a profit on the difference. 
E.g. try selling a $100 gift card on  for instance, you'll only get $75. 
Anyway I've used purse a few times and know that twice (at least) the purchase was made with a gift card. 
Just adding this info to the mix because everyone yells credit card fraud, and I don't see why the fraud would be any higher than straight up Amazon purchases. Also Amazon has a very sophisticated fraud detection system. Probably not the place you want to go with stolen cards.

True you're probably fine. To be on the safe side though always clear out your bitcoin from circle and send it to an address you control, just in case Circle decides to lock down your acct one day.
The more I think about it, Circle is a good route to go, because you don't want to use a static bitcoin address for all your clients (then they can see how much you're making). With circle or coinbase your clients can't follow your money.

Does checking blockchain.info mean you're relying on a third party? Technically yes, but this seems like an unnecessary requirement. How is that different from relying on many other services you need to do anything on the internet?
Generating addresses and all that you can do on your own. Knowing if there's bitcoin at those addresses you need to either run a full node, or ask some 3rd party (e.g. blockchain.info).

Circle is not anonymous. If you're both using circle you don't gain much over using PayPal. However if just your client opens a circle (or coinbase) account sends bitcoin to your bitcoin address (off of circle), then you've gone a long way toward anonymity. If they're large amounts, Circle could potentially block your client's account if they get suspicious. 
Here's another option: libertyx.com. You tell your client to go to one of their locations; he pays cash to get a libertyx pin code and emails it to you. You log in to libertyx to redeem the code for bitcoin. This is 100% anonymous for your client. And very anonymous for you too because libertyx just sends you bitcoin immediately upon redeeming pin-- they only ask for an email address. The problems with this approach though is 1) your client needs to go to a physical libertyx location 2) he can only buy pin in increments of $50, 100, 200..
Hope this helps. 
Edit: I see now you're in Australia. Nevermind on libertyx then. I think theyre only US, but maybe there's a similar service by you.

There are various online or mobile wallets that let you import a private key. I believe blockchain.info and mycelium mobile app offer this. 
So once you extract the private key of the address sent to from your Bitcore Core wallet, you can import it to blockchain.info wallet and spend.

You mean use your existing address to send your circle funds to? Yes you can do that. (On your circle wallet of course you'll be assigned a new address). 
Keep in mind though that if you spend from your current wallet for things that have your information, everything can potentially be linked together. For instance, lets say you buy maple syrup using your current wallet and have it shipped to your home address. And say Circle gets subpoenaed for all their records. The government can see that your circle account moved idk say $50,000, and then they see it went to an address (your current wallet) which then spent some bitcoin on [Nuclear Nova Maple Syrup]( They then subpoena Nuclear Nova for the address they shipped to. And now have your true identity linked to your Circle transactions. So in general you might want to keep a separate wallet for stuff you want to remain completely anonymous, or use tumblers. If you're just holding on to your bitcoin as savings for a long time, then you're ok.

You could also just carry your bitcoin address with you, either on a piece of paper or photo on your phone. This way clients can send payment to that address but no one can take the money. (Only when you're home with your private key or seed)
You of course will want to be able to verify that payment was sent. Some apps allow you to enter a "watch" address so you can just see the incoming payments. At the very least you can use blockchain.info to look up your address.

Coinbase pays the fee so don't worry about that part (almost all wallets will automatically take care of the fee, but deduct it from your balance).
When you say 2 transactions do you mean the bitcoin being sent to 2 addresses in one transaction? This is normal. When you send bitcoin you send everything at a particular address and the change is sent back to a new address (meaning back to coinbase). Does it show one of those addresses getting .2 bitcoin?

Thank you for the coffees! One is more than generous. Sending one back to pass on to the next person. $1.50 The more I think about it, the more I like the idea of not pushing for the user to log in. It's just refreshing to be able to start using a service without logging in first. I really like apps that don't require it, and not because I'm concerned about privacy. Also, especially in your case where users are likely suspicious of some catch, people will think you're selling their email address etc or will bug them with other marketing, so I think it's better to steer away from email addresses. When you launch the mobile apps too, I think there should be a no sign-in option. 
 
The best would be if you identify each user based on their device fingerprint. There are js libraries that would give you a unique object based on user's device specs. This would be really seamless. 
 Anyway, keep up the good work.

The security shortfalls they're referring to are DoS attacks. This is from what I understood in the first session where Mike Hearn (and I believe Gregory Maxwell) were talking about these potential issues. The current SWIFT network for instance cannot fall victim to such attacks because it doesn't run on the internet; it's a completely separate infrastructure. Of course Hearn was ridiculing the impractically of the need to run separate wires for this purpose. 
This could just be my impression from how the talks went. The banks are just uncomfortable with these unknown variables, and term them "security" risks.

With a traditional 2-of-3 multisig wallet, I need to find 3 secure, *independent* locations to store my keys. This is not that easy.
With Coinbase's 2-of-3 multisig wallet I really only have to find 2 secure, independent locations. Here's why: I have 2 keys + passwords to access coinbase (this is actually multiple pieces of info: my coinbase login/password, my 2FA, and also my passphrase to unlock the encrypted key that coinbase holds). This is actually easier to store because if someone gets ahold of the Coinbase info, it's still protected by Coinbase's 48-hour delay on vault withdrawals. During this time they send you emails notifying you of the requested withdrawal. This all means that I could store my coinbase password together with 1 of my keys, because it would still be very difficult for an attacker to get my coins. They would have to circumvent 2FA and have access to my email acct.

1. First I use Google's Inactive Account Manager  which will send an email after your account is inactive for some months. This will send instructions to my family where/how to recover my stuff.
2. I use a password manager [Dashlane]( to store all my passwords and secure notes. This is worth is weight in gold, it makes keeping track of passwords (and creating new ones) a breeze. I highly recommend it. It's very secure--dashlane only stores your data encrypted on their servers and only you can decrypt it with your master password. This is the password to everything. If you lose it you're fucked. Dashlane can't help you.
3. Now I need to get my family my master password when I'm gone. This is where Google's Inactive acct manager kicks in to notify them of (a) my login ID (b) where to find my master password. You can write your master password in a physical location somewhere they can access. Perhaps written inside a closet in your parents house. Perhaps etched in the shed behind your brother's house. Somewhere where no one would notice it, or even know what it is should they see it. It's just a jumble of characters. Also a good thing about Dashlane is that you can't use if from a new unauthorized device. They would need access to one of your devices. (You can perhaps describe in the Google email how to get into your devices, if that's password protected too.)
With this approach someone would need all 3 to get your stuff. (1) google automated email (2) access to physical location where master password is (3) access to your physical device.
I like this approach because it's not just bitcoin specific. Within Dashlane you can have secure notes that details all the places you might have money: bank accounts, online bitcoin wallets, offline bitcoin wallets, brokerage accounts etc. And you can keep changing your wallets/accounts without notifying anyone or going to a safe deposit box.
Good luck!

You have my upvote. 
Reducing the blockchain to just a permissionless database is actually doing bitcoin a disservice. There is a lot of innovative tech in bitcoin that is not merely a permissionless distributed database. You may be able to call it a database for lack of a better term, but it has properties you won't find in conventional databases. The fact that it's a "write only" ledger and no party, no administrator, has the ability to change this is 1 such property.

Litecoin had a run up from about $1.40 to $8 a couple months before the halving and then came back down to $3. So on the contrary looks like the halving had a very positive effect on the price.

When miners create a block, they are allowed to assign themselves a specified about of bitcoins (right now 25, next summer it will be 12.5, and then continue to halve every 4 years). If a miner doesn't follow the rules the block will be considering invalid and ignored by the other miners.

Yes you most definitely need to use your real info. They will know if you don't. There's nothing illegal about purchasing bitcoins. Do you want to be anonymous in your purchase? Then try a LibertyX.com location paying with cash (only in increments of $50 though). Or find a Bitcoin ATM (Google Bitcoin ATM map) but these have a significant markup. Localbitcoins is another option but the other 2 are better generally. LibertyX is great.

Coinbase is fine but goes against the ethos of bitcoin. You're pretty far removed from the bitcoin network, but instead entrusting a 3rd party to handle everything on your behalf, including holding your private keys. The exception to this is Coinbase's *multisig* vault. In this case they give you 2 of 3 keys so you have control over the bitcoin directly. 
As others suggested mycelium (for mobile) and electrum (for desktop) are good options. My personal favorite is Copay (works on all devices). For large amounts use their multi-signature wallet. This way if 1 device/key is compromised, your bitcoin is still safe.

There is no one source. Each miner is connecting to many other peers that are sending them new blocks (and new transactions). Very similar to BitTorrent--it's peer-to-peer. The miner looks at it and checks that it's valid according to all the rules, and that all the transactions within are valid. If it passes, it's added to the miner's current chain. Note that each new block contains a reference to the previous block by encapsulating a hash of it. In this way blocks are "chained" together, hence blockchain.
The bitcoin protocol is designed that a valid block will only be generated every 10 min, on average, so all the nodes/miners will be in sync and have the same chain. Sometimes 2 valid blocks will be generated at the same time, in which case some miners will have one and some will have the other, resulting in 2 valid chains. But then whichever of those 2 chains grows longer first will be deemed the correct chain, and all the miners on the shorter one will move over to the longer one

It sounds like you want to pay a website directly from Circle. While this is easy to do, It's not recommended to pay directly if you don't want circle to keep track what you're paying for. Especially true if you're buying something the government doesn't approve of. This is because it's possible certain bitcoin addresses are known to be owned by various entities. 
Instead, first move the bitcoin from Circle to a mobile wallet which is in your control. Download Copay for this (Mycelium and Breadwallet are also very good). Then, from your mobile wallet pay the website.

It is illegal in New York to flag down an Uber car and hop in. This is still the reserved privilege of yellow taxis (and green taxis outside lower manhattan), with the medallion on the hood which costs nearly million dollars to acquire. 
However it's always been legal to call a car service to your location and be picked up. To run this type of taxi service it's far cheaper and this is what uber is--they have a standard car service license. It's only now with the advent of smartphones that it's easy to request a cab from anywhere and the lines are blurred. But if a cop sees someone flag down an uber car they will ticket him.

You can use *Coinbase Exchange* assuming the exchange is available in your state. This is geared for trading so you don't pay the 1% fee on each buy and sell. I don't remember what their exchange fee is but it's much less. Another new but highly trusted exchange is Gemini.

Youre supposed to ask that you want to purchase a *QPay* pin. Did you say this? Only then when they ask which carrier/biller do you say LibertyX. There are so many of them within the QPay network, they won't know them by heart. And they almost surely won't know anything about bitcoin. This was the case when I've used LibertyX. 
It's possible the location no longer supports QPay altogether. This happened to be a couple times where they used to have QPay but then they dropped them, and switched to EPay or something.

They're searching for a special number that will allow them to package a new block. Each new block needs the property that its hash is less than a certain target. They can only do this by changing the data slightly within the block--they modify a dummy variable called a nonce. Then they re-hash hoping to get a result that below the target number. Basically they are looking for the right nonce.

Yes every arcade machine should run on quarters or tokens where you need to first find the token machine and hope you have small bills to feed it. And then run out of tokens just when you got to a new level and wonder whether you can run to get more tokens before the 10 seconds are up.
It's also great to have staff constantly empty the arcade machines and restock the token machines. It's not like these places have any wifi connection for the machines to connect to. Only my local frozen yogurt shop can manage that.

Like others said it's not something you can just follow by eyeballing. You would need sophisticated tools and analysis to map out what's going on. Keep in mind nearly all wallets use many addresses under the hood, and generate a new return address for each transaction.
A scenario I could see being a problem is one day your uncle pays you $10 to your bitcoin address. The next day you win the bitcoin lottery and it's paid out to the same address. Then your uncle could be like whoa where'd that $50,000,000 come from? And then you have all your relatives knocking on your door for money. Or a less extreme example is that you sell your house for bitcoin and don't want your uncle knowing how much it sold for. But as long as you use a fresh address in these cases you're fine.
As far as Coinbase goes, there are a lot of libertarians in this sub, who don't want any corporation, any government, knowing what they're up to. Theoretically the US government could subpoena coinbase for their records. But coinbase was just an example; you could use any exchange deposit address. Although I do like coinbase's URL feature  and they automatically change this address every couple weeks adding more confusion to the mix.

I don't understand how they get this random state. Is it from how they're manufactured? Or are they somehow very sensitive to the environment?
In a couple Abstracts on SRAM I see:
"The identity results from manufacture-time physically random device threshold voltage mismatch, and the random numbers result from runtime physically random noise. 
In addition to identification, we show that SRAM fingerprints capture noise, enabling true random number generation."
and another 
"There are some research works to exploit the aggressive process variation for the identification of individual devices. They find measurable physical characteristics that are unique to each integrated circuit. Among them, device identification using initial power-up values of SRAM cells, called SRAM fingerprints, has been emphasized lately in part due to the abundant availability of SRAM cells in modern microprocessors. More importantly, since the cross-coupled inverter structure of each SRAM cell amplifies even the small mismatches between two inverter nodes, it is thus very sensitive to and maximizes the effect of random process variation, making SRAM fingerprints to acquire great features as a naturally inherent device ID. "
But still unclear to me.
@_date: 2015-03-24 14:39:38

Most likely the bitcoin exchanges in Turkey follow some kind of "know your customer" procedures (how rigorous I have no idea). And it is possible that the Turkish government could require extra monitoring of Kurdish nationals and ask for that information. And I imagine it's possible for the Turkish government to shut down any exchange if they feel they're being used to funnel money to PKK/YPG/YPJ groups. 
Maybe you can set up your own website/exchange to sell bitcoin for local currency? Or as I said , use localbitcoins:  I assume you would want to sell for Turkish lira?
If this all seems impractical, then I will offer 1 more extreme solution: use bitcoin as much as you can. Convince whomever you need to send money to accept bitcoin as payment. Anyone with a smartphone can download Mycelium and accept your payment directly in bitcoin. Sounds crazy now maybe, but wait a year and it won't.

Would you agree that money *as a tool* is useful? It makes exchanging value and keeping track of debt very easy. If we had no money "tool", commerce would be very difficult. Gold has properties that make it a very good as such a tool. US dollars are very good too. They're not perfect (gold is heavy, dollars can be printed at the whim of the government), but they're way better than other alternatives you can think of: wheat, wood, woodpeckers... This is their intrinsic value. Yes, paper money has intrinsic value. It's a tool created by the government that is a very good for moving value around. In this way bitcoin has intrinsic value too.

Whatever you decide, Google's [inactive account manager]( is good for sending instructions where all your stuff is, what accounts, online wallets etc you have. 
Then it's good to have a password manager -- I use Dashlane -- that stores all your passwords to online wallets and other financial accts. The master password to this you need to secure somewhere (in a safe-deposit box) along with private keys to offline wallets. 
Live long and prosper.

I guess it depends on whether or not you think law enforcement does more harm than good. 
Admittedly the whole "war on drugs" is misguided if not immoral, but that's not really law enforcement's fault. That's an issue with our society somehow being convinced it's a worthy war to wage.

Couldn't agree more. Everyone is clamoring for "absolute" proof without any thought that maybe Satoshi / Craig doesn't want to to provide absolute proof. He did try to stay anonymous for 7 years, didn't he?
@_date: 2015-02-03 21:42:48
Agreed. It should be locked-down by default and only after a user manually authorizes and sets withdrawal limits to 3rd-party apps can they be activated.  
I think the tacit assumption by a user is that they still have all the same strong Coinbase security/trust when they link a 3rd party app, but really the trust is only as good as your weakest link.
Anyway keep up the good work.
@_date: 2015-02-08 03:20:23
Then coinbase, circle or buttercoin. Really no reason to use anything else. 
Personally I use Coinbase because their wallet has many great features (Vault, SMS service, personal url...), and much higher buy limits ($50,000/day). But you might get a slightly better price on Circle. You need to compare the rate at time of purchase, and factor in the coinbase 1% fee.

I'm in the US (NY) and have one. They were running a promotion a couple months ago where they credited back the cost of the card (.2 btc) on first load of .9 btc. You can ask them if it's still running. The email interaction I had with them was with someone "Patrick" and seemed to be a native English speaker. 
Cost of shipping to NY was .065 btc.

It demonstrates though that you can lock-in any content to the blockchain. So in 10 years after 6 reprints they can prove what the original was. 
Granted not very necessary here but you can imagine the usefulness for tamper-proof databases. Like what [factom]( is doing.

Ahh any other time I would join you, but I'm out of the city for the weekend. In Fort Greene Bklyn there's Lean Crust Pizza--the shop that's in the Spurlock bitcoin episode.

As for where to buy Coinbase.com and Circle.com are the clear favorites. Personally I like the extra features on Coinbase.
And if you want a wallet that you can access on your phone/tablet/PC then you want a web-based wallet. For that Coinbase and Circle are your answer. They both have very nice iOS apps.

I don't have any experience, but I think you're right, best approach is to not use that multi-sig, cold wallet stuff people rant about. It's really not necessary and will just slow you down. Also you can cut out any customer service, just use one of those google voice numbers.

My understanding is that it wasn't exactly a centralized system in the sense it could be transferred from user to user without Citi's involvement. May have required proprietary hardware to make transfers, or authorized gateways.

The truth is we trust computer programs with a lot more than money--we trust them with our lives. When you're in an airplane, you're trusting the auto-pilot to not nose-dive the plane. And to a lesser degree we put our trust in rail and car computer systems. We also trust programs to manage our infrastructure and and energy systems. Computer programs can be made safe with rigorous procedures and fail-safes.
What computer systems are very bad at is keeping data safe, because then it's not a matter of making sure a program does 100% what it's supposed to do but also that it absolutely cannot be forced to do what it's not supposed to do. What you hear about in the news about hacking are really data breaches. It's is very very difficult to get a computer to protect some honey pot of information --namely because the program still has to allow authorized access and be able to differentiate it with unauthorized access.
However in bitcoin there is no honeypot of data to get at. All the data is out in the open. There is nothing to steal. What can be stolen are the private keys to access public bitcoin addresses, but these keys are not stored on the bitcoin network.
