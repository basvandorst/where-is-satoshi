Why is this a good thing?

Is that a general deflation-cannot-happen argument?  What about the numerous cases when it has happened (with bad outcomes)!


So far, the value of Bitcoin in circulation is small compared to the amount of fiat currency.  So we wouldn't expect to see any macroeconomic effects yet.




One individual can't control money.  We all collectively give power to the central banks by accepting the currency they issue.


There are other ways to do it.  The central bank could make loans to lending banks, who then make riskier loans at higher rates to businesses.  With FDIC, that is essentially what we do, except that the money passes through savings accounts.  The goal should be to avoid moral hazard while still having a stable financial system.

How does that work?  You keep a copy of the private key?
@_date: 2013-04-06 13:02:36
The private key should have base58 encoding as well as a QR-code.  That makes it easier to type into your computer.

Splitting up your wallet is a neat idea.  If you XOR these three numbers together, you'll get a private key:

Here's a simpler idea.  Easier to implement, too.

We need to encourage **investment**, not savings.  They are not equal.

You are confusing TARP with QE.  I support QE, but would also support breaking up the banks.

1) A weak dollar would help us.  It would help our exports and redcuce the trade deficit.  Inflation would also make it easier to pay down debts.
2) I see very little evidence that inflation over the past few years was any higher than before QE.  Check the Consumer Price Index.  I'd like a little more inflation, if that meant a lot less unemployment.
3) Money in saving accounts lose value because short term interest rates are so low.  That has nothing to do with QE, which targets long-term interest rates.
4) Low interest rates are necessary to put people back to work.  If you want a world where savings accounts yield high returns, make sure the financial system lacks the power to over-leverage itself like it has.
5) Gold/bitcoin/whatever isn't a cure for what ails the economy.  if you find a guaranteed safe haven for your money, that just encourages you NOT to invest in risky ventures like new businesses, new industry, new technology, or even new expansions of existing business.  That's why the inflation target is around 2%.  Just enough to discourage you from placing your savings in a mattress, but not enough to disrupt the economy.

It is only 115 lines of Python code.  Read it yourself to find out if it is malware.
Has anyone audited Brainwallet?  I tried to read it's code, but it was obfuscated.  So I wrote my own code that I trust.  You should do the same.  But feel free to read through my code to get an idea of what is involved.

What's wrong with QE?  What bad effects have you seen?

if they throw out the key you gave them, those bitcoins are lost forever.
