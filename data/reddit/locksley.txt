Something to ease the eye.
I grew tired of reading base58/hash160 strings, it was hard to follow along an address's history just by looking at text.

Why are they scams?
Is it that you don't think they fundamentally have value or solve any problems?

It's an open source project :)
The overall aim is to demonstrate the fact that property can be tied to the Blockchain.

Yep! Co-founder @ helloblock.io

By "property" I mean additional attributes tied to an address or transaction.

It's naive to assume "regulation is bad, we should free market all the things".
Regulation is just a tool. In the case of the BitLicence, the core problem we are trying to fix is money laundering.
However, AML/"Know your customer" rules are bullshit because they are ineffective. Fraudsters can easily create fake identities to circumvent the rules. Meanwhile, businesses continue to wear the cost of increased compliance.
This doesn't necessarily mean all financial regulation is counter-productive. For example, the SEC busted a Bitcoin ponzi scheme 2 years ago.

This round has been settled. Please see the results here:
All payouts have been marked with: Futureblock Payouts
All refunds are also marked Futureblock Invalid Bet Refund
A few notes:
1. There are a few bettors that sent us bitcoins from shared wallets / hosted wallets (such as Coinbase) where they often add a number of inputs addresses. This makes it difficult to send your bitcoins back. In the case, there are multiple input addresses. We have sent them all back to the first input address.
We recommend using blockchain.info wallet. 
2. There are a number of invalid bets that came through. Such as sending bitcoin after the round has closed. This transaction was made at 5am PDT which is about 11 hours after the round had closed. 
The transaction has been refunded here:
There are a number of other invalid bets.
[EDIT] This comment has been editted as we like to get a few key ideas across. The original comment is the last dot point
From the Futureblock team:
Despite our best efforts and intention to be as clear as possible, we realised that there might be a few ideas that were not clearly communicated. Some users were confused about certain things that we did not expect. We take full responsibility of that. As a result, anyone on the winning side that had a negative return will receive a full refund.
**Above all else, we want to create stability in the bitcoin ecosystem through a transparent exchange.**
**We are here to build an open derivatives exchange that will allow anyone to hedge their BTC risks.**
**LONG STORY:**
Here are some key points that we would like to communicate across:
**Negative return on the winning side** - As pointed out, in [this comment!]( Like any exchange market, everyone will act rationally in their own best interest, at the point where there is an negative return, or at the point where the return is not sufficient to cover the risk of making the bet than betting will cease. At this point, [efficient market equilibrium will be reached]( This is extremely important, as this is the point we will have a *fair price* for the derivatives driven by [free market forces]( And it is at this point, it will have value for miners to hedge their risks against an efficient market.
Our goal is that as we gain transactions volume, we will shorten the betting period from 12 hours to 6 to 3 etc. And eventually facilitate a real time market.
**House Fees** - Although we called it house fees for clear communication, we like to see this as [[transaction fee to faciliate and “make” the market](  The high transaction fee, although in hindsight was controversial, it was deliberate to encourage more earlier bets, as this matures, the fees will come down to a level that resembles the typical exchange.
**The fee level chosen was arbitrary and temporary, the fee structure chosen was what we thought would best encourage betting and maximize our independence as a provider**. (Please refer to below for more details on why we chose this fee structure)
**Insider manipulation** - We have zero incentive to manipulate the prediction target or any other variables, because an unstable market is terrible for an exchange. We have also done everything we can to maximize transparency and independence (and we will continue to do more). Furthermore, there is simply no point for any miner or blockchain.info to manipulate their activities to make money on betting here. As they will lose orders of magnitude more in interrupting their activities than making a few BTCs on our platform. However, if we get to the point where we feel there is even a remote chance that could happen, we will then handle those variables in house.
**Last minute sniping** - This is actually impossible as there is a 12 hour gap between close and payout. This means once the betting has closed, **the race has just begun**. There will be another 12 hours of potential volatility before we find out the winner. So last minute sniping might actually be a bad idea. As you are paying higher fees% and still 12 hours away from payout.
**Why did we choose this payout structure** - In designing the house fee, there were 2 approaches our team discussed
1.Take a portion of winnings for winning bets
2.Take a portion of the every bet
The formula you provided above fits no .1. However, we chose no. 2.
This is because if we chose 1., we as Future Block would not be impartial to the results of any given day. e.g. for today, we'd have an incentive to ensure the 'below pool' wins and therefore take more winning fees. This incentive is counter productive and may lose the trust of the bettors.
We apologise for not having made this more clear for the outright.

Reddit isn't on the trade wiki page. If this gets more traction, I'll dedicate more time to scrape more data sources.
@_date: 2013-10-08 18:05:05
Punters will take the other side, such as SatoshiDice/BetCoin players. But the point is that you'll be betting on something useful which creates value for the BTC ecosystem, rather than just a dice game.
Sorry, but can't give away too much re formula, but you can kinda guess what's being used. Basically, it's a type of regression.
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:51:47
Does it say "CONNECTION: DOWN" on the top right? Otherwise, if you could tell me what's been logged in chrome console, that'd be super helpful!

Dude, hit us up anytime with Bitcoin questions. Developer infrastructure around Bitcoin suck balls since it's still early days. We've been through a lot of pain building these projects but now know the quirks.

I'm using the blockchain info api, 
Yeah that's correct. My guess is if you're using a desktop client, then that would reveal your location unless you're using a proxy/TOR.
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:44:57
Yeah,  
It's a bit messy though given it's my first node/angular project.
I'd recommend you just checkout 
@_date: 2013-12-27 21:30:18
Thanks a lot cody, yeah we're talking to some people about write ups. Did you have something particular in mind? Feel free to message me
@_date: 2013-12-24 02:45:33
 listens to all tweets mentioning " and " If it's a retweet, the bot ignores it, otherwise, the bot tries to parse it and then sends a transaction (or handles the error).
@_date: 2013-12-24 02:57:59
Nope. Squatters ...
@_date: 2013-12-23 17:47:37
Yeah we thought about using that. But "claim" seems a bit spammy, like a prize contest. What do you think? Any other suggestions?
@_date: 2013-12-23 23:16:53
Had to google that reference.
For everyone else who's still confused - 
@_date: 2013-12-23 17:32:06
That's the goal :) Just trying to make this as simple as possible. 
Do let us know if you have any feature requests.
And feel free to create issues/pull requests on our repo 
@_date: 2013-12-24 02:56:51
We query the blockchain.info api for unspent outputs in order to build transactions. It's signed using the private keys on our own servers and then pushed our again to blockchain.info/push_tx
@_date: 2013-10-08 16:44:07
Thanks! Just fixed that sign up error :)
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:49:05
What version of Chrome are you running? We tested on Version 31.0.1650.63
@_date: 2013-12-24 19:54:33
Ahhh, yeah that's right. Gonna work on this communication point today, quite a few people have had trouble with this.
Perhaps the tip amount (0.01 BTC), already includes a 0.0001 BTC miner fee. Although that'll mean the recipient only gets 0.0099 BTC. 
What do you think?
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:03:20
Thanks! Fix has been deployed on the ChromeStore, should now read version 1.0.9
@_date: 2013-12-24 02:47:41
Yeah I agree, we're really waiting for an organization like Bitcoin Foundation to make a move on this. If there is no mass adoption of "mBTC", it just confuses people.
That being said, we DO allow mBTC in the tweet :)
For all possibles syntaxes, see

Not yet! If this gains enough steam, we'll definitely be making a firefox extension. But we chose Chrome because 66% of users on our previous btc projects use Chrome.
@_date: 2013-10-08 17:34:07
That's true. Thanks for the suggestion. Problem is difficulty only changes every 2016 blocks (~2 weeks), which makes it less fun. What do you think?
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:10:14
Thanks, I'm looking into this now
@_date: 2013-10-08 17:55:01
Good idea! As this site gains more volume, I'll definitely being opening new games and new derivatives.


@_date: 2013-12-11 19:04:41
You can go into chrome://extensions, enable developer mode and load unpacked extension for now.
We haven't had to deal with building our own .crx since it's deployed through Chrome Webstore.
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:15:51
Yep, that's exactly why we open sourced it.
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:54:16
Not yet, in the works.
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:37:39
AngularJS + d3.js
Source code here 
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:10:21
Yeah, we'll looking at handling bitcoin: protocol links in the most unintrusive way possible. Personally, I hate extensions that add all this shit on your screen.
Edit: changed bitcoin:// to bitcoin:
@_date: 2013-12-12 02:15:05
What's crashing? Can you provide more detail?
@_date: 2013-12-23 17:51:28
Yeah just the mining fee, which is hardcoded to be 0.0001 BTc, the minimum value.
@_date: 2013-10-08 16:28:23
Feel free to send some small bets through, 0.01 to 0.02 BTC (min bet is 0.01 BTC). You'll see the site update within 10 seconds when you refresh.
Other than that, all the bets (and then payouts) can be 'audited' in the blockchain. i.e. for the above pool, you can check 
Hope that helps!
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:36:59
Early days my friend. 
We seem to forget in the early days of the internet, the only use cases were e-mail and porn. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:02:50
Fix has been deployed. Can you please try again? Make sure it's Version 1.0.9
@_date: 2013-11-05 06:44:40
Yeah I saw that too, but could be a legacy page. Are you getting a "pay with bitcoin" option when you checkout?
@_date: 2013-12-24 18:59:39
Can you give me the full details? What's your twitter handler?
@_date: 2013-12-27 22:11:52
which company was it?
@_date: 2013-12-23 21:20:22
Similarly, Twitter could be the key for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-24 02:50:20
you can tip us at  or  :p
I would prefer  though hehe
