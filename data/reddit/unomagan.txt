Something like that for Android wear? 
@_date: 2015-12-03 08:31:57
Buy buy buy buy! 
@_date: 2015-12-27 08:35:26
So, time to buy? 
@_date: 2015-12-11 20:45:35
You have three axes a line "walks on" when you are talking about predictability. 
@_date: 2015-12-07 10:58:34
This attachment is....  A zip as a exe. Whoops. 
@_date: 2015-12-17 16:06:45
He is creating bitcoin 2.0 with ripple :p
@_date: 2015-06-07 06:59:58
Who the heck up votes that?
@_date: 2015-06-07 06:56:39
And driverless trains! 
@_date: 2015-12-26 14:55:10
Yeah, I except a growth like Facebook. Steady and "slow" with a lot of bubbles and calling. The end is nigh! 
And we just stay and watch and make a nice profit. 
@_date: 2015-12-25 17:22:48
Time to buy? 
@_date: 2015-12-16 18:10:39
Shipped six month later. First they need to "test" them. 
@_date: 2015-06-09 17:39:54
Is there a sub for stuff like that? Life "ask an English professor"? I'm curious now, wife says it wrong, but grew up in us. So Oxford English might differ or so lol
@_date: 2015-06-17 08:04:14
I bet he still told people how evil it is...
@_date: 2015-06-10 07:32:26
You mean a singular thought?
@_date: 2015-06-20 16:46:22
Wouldn't be, you know, already enough if you do damage to the block chain for just 20 minutes?
@_date: 2015-06-30 05:29:41
So, uhh, we are in a bubble now?
@_date: 2015-06-08 10:11:10
So, next step a distributed drug cartel with coloured coins as shares ?
@_date: 2015-06-03 12:41:14
@_date: 2015-06-20 16:51:24
Millions? wow lol thats like 0.000000000001% of Euro in greece...
Its happening!
@_date: 2015-06-09 08:49:29
I'm not a native speaker either. But my wife is lol. She always corrects me. 
As a general rule of thumb: if it is about a person: it is become.

Level three cyberware ( neural controlled supported with own neural nets and processor ) faster, more accurate working, shooting etc.
@_date: 2015-06-03 09:39:04
Even better: greenshot , open source very good screen shot tool with various upload options
@_date: 2015-06-04 13:16:00
Who needs them? Just get on the street or on local bitcoins to buy coins.
@_date: 2015-06-04 06:21:55
If they would do that in Germany they could close there shop.
@_date: 2015-06-17 11:29:50
Which I think is bullshit. Several stocks look good so far. Even they said today in radio the "grexit" is very likely. 
Usually they are the first to move if something is up. Even if it is fud.
So point is. Nothing will go wrong when greece exits. They did the same to Bavaria hundreds of years back. 
Sure, a lot debt will be left behind which the EU needs to pay. But no cascading effect. 
@_date: 2015-06-29 15:14:24
Yup, money works like gravity. And bitcoin will soak it up like a black hole.
@_date: 2015-12-10 15:48:56
Need to pay those Chinese kid hands creating it! 
@_date: 2015-06-16 07:37:45
Every 30 seconds would be too low imho. Prior notice a pattern to quickly... I would set like every 9 to 11 minutes. 
@_date: 2015-06-02 05:02:09
It's already happening. To late to discuss. 
@_date: 2015-06-17 11:26:39
Stop buying! I want to buy in before the bubble bursts!
@_date: 2015-06-24 10:55:35
yes, yes. 
But several studies showed that humans are not that baaad at pattern recognition (for example women can tell by a picture if someone is gay) 
@_date: 2015-06-09 10:59:08
And most of the stocks crash.
@_date: 2015-06-29 15:10:32
Very true, people are lazy. 
And Greece will be probably "saved" . Merkel is just too much going on Greece. Either we lose everything or save Greece. 
No second option. 
@_date: 2015-12-17 16:24:54
Everyone who you voted into office. 
@_date: 2014-10-29 07:16:31
Well, what if I try to sell you a transport car, with 110 kw, and tell you: You can make up to 8$ an hour for transporting stuff. 
Than later you find out the market is crowded with transporters in the city  and you make only 5$, that´s a scam to?
@_date: 2014-07-16 15:39:09
Don't you regret spending your Bitcoin with every price rise? 
Shouldn't you save them?
After that time do you start to save more? And buy cheaper or less?
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:01:10
And why does the worth of the firm doubled for example? What makes a firm worth 800$ instead of 400$ (You still have the one btc share) Which growth satisfy the increase of worth of the firm while they just still sell the same products and maybe have 10% more customers (maybe)
@_date: 2014-02-10 07:36:35
And will get fairly common later on, think of Bitstamp offchain, bitpay and other services. Theys will work like banks but called wallets lol 
@_date: 2014-03-04 11:23:44
Buuuuubbbbbblllleeeeeee :)
@_date: 2014-06-05 15:08:26

@_date: 2014-01-15 18:36:56
I sold all my coins to marry :-)
@_date: 2014-02-23 19:52:20
Yes but there is no end like a normal pyramid
@_date: 2014-06-12 15:59:08
Bitcoin is the iPhone of money. Customers don't know they want it until they see it. 
So we need more merchants. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 06:47:56
zzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZzz it is getting boring.
@_date: 2014-01-09 07:53:24
I hope they do, cheap coins incoming :D
@_date: 2014-04-29 11:26:46
Now downvote me :)
@_date: 2014-04-30 06:19:40
This is actually good news!
@_date: 2014-02-13 17:32:35
And they are fed?
@_date: 2014-06-06 05:08:01
Function follows greed, we are still in greed phase.
@_date: 2014-07-30 05:44:45
Oh gosh I'm laughing like a little kid. I hope no one saw it in train Lol
@_date: 2014-06-13 07:46:15
Even with less than 51% it's called selfish mining. It's like a traffic jam on purpose.
@_date: 2014-06-11 07:34:35
no no, Bitcoin will fix wars :)
@_date: 2014-02-13 11:19:07
In Germany it is "private currency" no idea what it means for paypal thou lol.
@_date: 2015-06-08 10:07:13
Has become... -_-
@_date: 2014-11-20 14:39:23


@_date: 2014-04-26 06:04:51
I bet the guy is partying hard now :-)
@_date: 2014-03-28 06:46:30
I would say in around a week, plus minus one or two days. Until then the price will drop I guess.
@_date: 2014-02-14 06:20:28
It's not dead, just sell offs to buy cheaper.
@_date: 2014-04-26 18:47:33
To his defense, even a with a normal "online" bank account the ame could happen or credit card data.
@_date: 2014-06-05 15:12:13
Funnily, the Euro will last longer than many, many other currencies.
@_date: 2014-01-16 17:25:49
Quick, all buy before it goes to moon (after me pls :) )
@_date: 2014-10-16 06:27:58
+100 BTC
@_date: 2014-04-09 09:09:04
118 Euro nice, but my shop is not that big and famous to buy something like that...
@_date: 2014-04-07 19:35:32
This is good news :-) it is beginning 
@_date: 2014-02-06 06:03:17
Every news is a good news :-)
@_date: 2014-03-06 16:30:12
Goodbye, was nice to have you here on earth as a catalyst, I hope it won't be too painful when you leave. See you later. 
@_date: 2014-06-10 07:37:49
Holy smoke.
@_date: 2014-05-29 12:53:05
Send through bitpay to bitpay account. Cost? Almost zero.
@_date: 2014-01-17 19:00:46
Newest study shows that almost never a whole Bitcoin is traded. And you say 30.000 Bitcoin won't make a difference? Lol
@_date: 2014-04-08 04:33:53
Lol with there five cents per day they can freely spent lol
@_date: 2014-07-24 14:05:38
Do a ping and tracert to:
Your proxy, NAt, router, DNS server, with both: IP and name.
go on "how is my ip" page, do a tracert and ping to your IP, try a reverse lookup (your ISP could have a CNAT or transparent proxy) try to find a "https how is my ip site"
@_date: 2014-10-07 09:14:04
This is really huge! all the young cool kids will see Bitcoin payments!
When they earn money on there own (not from there parents) they will consider Bitcoin!
this is really a sweet long term ad!
@_date: 2014-07-24 08:11:05
Nope, she knows that Bitcoin will change the world, while now idea how it works (p2p and such) I explained it to her in a dumped down way.
She is more the nature and "religion" kind of women I´m more tech and stuff :)
PS: She is "ok" with Bitcoin and sees it as the future. While I don´t shove it in her face lol
@_date: 2014-02-20 20:58:28
And you can keep your money. Brilliant.
@_date: 2014-01-30 17:51:26
Which will decrease value immediately. Like Bitcoin does now. But luckily Bitcoin is big enough to not crash like crazy.
@_date: 2014-02-23 19:39:04
So, bitcoin represents real world wealth distribution?
@_date: 2014-11-04 12:14:28
The only logical step would be rippe like network. With a "any merchant can join" way. (Not like many other were you weren´t able to join)
Than I could see this thing going somewhere.
@_date: 2014-05-20 05:42:08
Buy, buy, buy! 
@_date: 2014-04-05 06:48:01
I sold all my shares shortly after ipo, something felt wrong with it. Glad I did.
@_date: 2014-04-20 16:30:35
We all liked the dark age with deflationary money (Gold). I hope (and think) we will go back to something like that. We need it. It gives the humans and earth time to rest and understand.
@_date: 2014-05-27 18:05:35
Mimimi I was late
@_date: 2014-01-14 08:01:59
Hehe, didn´t thought about that. You get paid less and less Bitcoin every year. Now every year we wouldn´t talk about how much rise you get. You talk about how much won´t be reduced lol
@_date: 2014-10-10 10:14:14
Working with banks: 
No one gives a shit.
Except maybe like 10 managers
@_date: 2014-07-08 09:24:52
So what? 
We still have the benefit of uncontrolled worldwide "money" transfer in TEN minutes.
@_date: 2014-05-25 14:07:28
When 80% of humans don't need to work anymore ( and we get every day closer to this ) you should kill yourself. Or let 80 % of humans die and suffer. Or accept that even right now not anymore all humans need to work. 
The time where humans needed to work to have a functioning society past long ago. 
Accept the change or support Bitcoin and greed. 
While I support Bitcoin because I like the dark corporations future and want the earth to get some rest. 
@_date: 2014-11-23 10:45:36


@_date: 2014-05-31 10:06:08
Yep , in Germany it was like: what is MySpace? Oh that nerd thing no one wants
@_date: 2014-05-17 06:19:13
I plan to do the same, but no kids so far :-(
@_date: 2014-01-24 11:01:06
The point is? Startups, VC´s whatnot do the same. I don´t see something wrong if you want to profit from something you create. 
@_date: 2014-05-15 15:14:31
They fear the future it promises. No state, no money control, no entity who  owns or controls the money. 
So ending in an almost 100% corporations controlled world. What the difference to now would be is another question...
@_date: 2014-07-18 20:50:09

How is it working in South Africa? Bank wire? Or how is the money transferred from and to bitx? 
@_date: 2014-06-03 04:23:48
Hehe yeah, no more growth! Fuck yeah :-)
@_date: 2014-01-09 12:15:02
Good for us to buy cheap coins :)
@_date: 2014-07-17 16:08:11
Like China where no one cares anymore.
@_date: 2014-01-23 12:38:23
What about Dogecoin and litecoin? and Quark and all the others? :)
@_date: 2014-01-03 19:25:07
It could be from a firm like Apple or Google. Millions of millions of devices get the necessary apps automatically installed :-)
@_date: 2014-02-06 19:22:21
Until Apple releases icoin and you are fucked lol
@_date: 2014-07-24 07:35:40
Sure Bitcoins will go the way of our "known money" (banks, cartells, firms, etc.) But: it will be worldwide, that´s the biggest point of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-06-20 16:06:46
Perfect fit, Bitcoin and Switzerland! This is very huge!
@_date: 2014-02-10 06:53:42
Made my day :-)
@_date: 2014-03-04 11:28:01
I guess sell.
@_date: 2014-10-10 14:38:23
This year you can add another 10 to 20% because of changed laws...
@_date: 2014-04-07 11:52:30
Yeah, well, let´s see in two or three years, maybe... the first beta...
@_date: 2014-06-24 14:44:02
You forget the steady worth increase of Bitcoin. With greed people throw a lot of world views and concerns out of the window. 
@_date: 2014-07-24 16:27:59
Well than okay siri call wife
@_date: 2014-07-30 15:23:44
It is exposure to the world. The same thing paypall did at start. Shove it into the have of everyone until they started to use. Making money while doing it? Why not?
@_date: 2014-06-04 19:53:02
I see the benefit of the red queen effect.
@_date: 2014-05-08 07:36:46
Are they still there?
@_date: 2014-01-06 07:14:26
PS: Buy Bitcoins, kill two flies with one clap, get rich with the other rich people on earth and evade taxation (in Europe at least) :)
@_date: 2014-05-30 21:43:44
@_date: 2014-02-14 14:25:10
Or drop lol
@_date: 2014-08-01 11:06:46
Nope, people with more than 1000 BTC will be insane rich, only one need to be like "Obama" and co.
@_date: 2014-07-20 09:38:14
What a bullshit and a bunch of paranoia 
@_date: 2014-08-12 09:10:50
@_date: 2014-03-29 21:00:46
They can, if they want to. Just in every back location they set up a mining rig. Instead of a database from Oracle or mssql. Which might be even cheaper.
@_date: 2014-10-10 10:29:17
In Germany same: Rent, energy, gas / oil EXPLODED three folded! More and more money is going down there.
What helps a smarphone is now 10Euro cheaper than before if you pay triple price for energy...
@_date: 2014-03-31 20:24:22
Yup, that's what I'm waiting for :-) and it will happen. Something which sounds nine on paper, like communism but humans aren't nice :-)
@_date: 2014-02-13 06:36:40
Much racism. So wow
@_date: 2014-05-30 16:33:52

@_date: 2014-04-26 18:54:16
It's you.
@_date: 2014-12-18 09:33:41
Well if shit hits the fan I wouldn´t buy anything digital. What use is it without power? You need trade goods, food and defense.
@_date: 2014-12-19 08:56:12
When you think about how much is automated.... my godness..
@_date: 2014-03-31 15:43:29
Lie! 
@_date: 2014-08-13 14:34:25
Yeah, very. More likely the value really just went down.
@_date: 2014-02-13 13:12:57
There is a fix, but rich people won´t like it. So we are moving everyday toward to a total capitalistic and later family lead firms (for generations) which rule the states by every day (rule of gravity of money) I think this will be the state for the next several thousand years to come.
@_date: 2014-02-13 14:42:17
It would be way to early, that would price the price way to fast, way to early to much up.
@_date: 2014-04-07 12:07:51


Means: Alpha, and I would not use such a product (directly related to finance / Bitcoin) without a lot of testing and stability aka: In two or three years. But if you like another Mt Gox, go on, no problem :)
(Getting tired of told you so posts, so I will write it here instead of in six month or a year)
Told you so :))))
@_date: 2014-12-12 12:45:11


@_date: 2014-05-15 11:08:30
And Wall Street will win :)
@_date: 2014-02-20 12:06:27
And Bitcoin still falls in price, shouldn´t it raise when coins are lost? :)
@_date: 2014-05-25 14:22:16
It was sure that this will happen since the beginning of Bitcoin. No way to buy cheaper hardware and energy than a corp can.
@_date: 2014-07-16 04:40:24
Some idiots tell you that. But worldwide payment and killing states and local currencies is the real killer "app"
@_date: 2014-05-15 11:05:28
Colored coin suppport please :)
@_date: 2014-07-14 15:49:50
They can but they are also making money :)
@_date: 2014-04-09 12:42:27
HOw many people tried and failed? Are we reaching hundreds now?
@_date: 2014-03-25 11:41:46
Greed :D
@_date: 2014-06-08 17:05:15
Still not falling:-(
@_date: 2014-10-26 14:49:26
Much like gold, gold does not care about ideas. Just about its worth
@_date: 2014-07-18 10:49:22

Germany is totally open for Bitcoin ;)
@_date: 2014-07-13 07:46:14
All the hodlers and savers are proud and happy!  
PS: next time he won't spent bitcoin I hope :)
@_date: 2014-07-18 10:49:43
@_date: 2014-01-28 11:27:49
I preditec that stuff moooooooooooonth (maybe years? Is there a "own comment search engine?) ago.
But I also predict that Bitcoin will get huge, very huge. Give it time, the next hype will come :)
PS: Yes fees will increase do to mono /oligopoles, but thats how it is.
@_date: 2014-05-11 06:00:33
Two or three
@_date: 2014-11-21 15:14:44
I would recommend 1822 in Frankfurt, they seem to be nice and don´t care (for now) lol
@_date: 2014-12-12 12:45:39
Does´nt you pay over a certain volume?
@_date: 2014-02-16 18:03:30
I'm talking about monthly payments.
@_date: 2014-05-20 14:12:29
Yup that´s the real disaster...
@_date: 2014-02-15 20:17:14
Surprise :-)
@_date: 2014-05-11 15:35:30
Western union is soooooo small. Right?
@_date: 2014-06-11 12:44:39
yup, I think so too.
@_date: 2014-02-24 16:13:01
I'm not talking about neo, imagine any product, for example a car, first year one btc sold. Because of deflation you can't get back more btc per share not even the same btc, so you bought paid one etc in first year it was hundred dollar per share next year would be one etc and three hundred dollar no firm can grow in worth like btc will or could.
@_date: 2014-01-01 19:13:19
It is normal. But not a tragedy, it is perfectly organized and normal that centralized systems are more efficient. The facebooks would be idiotic for example.
@_date: 2014-05-26 16:55:32
And we will pay a terrible price for Bitcoin.so what?
@_date: 2014-05-11 05:53:59
Amazon could create it's own sidechain called Amazon coins
@_date: 2014-08-13 12:57:17
But you don´t earn money while holding an Ipod, that´s a huge difference! 
@_date: 2014-07-08 13:59:51
No, only capital matters, and this capital isn´t with normal people, we just need intel, foxconn, Apple and co. There is the money.
@_date: 2014-07-08 09:16:59
Make a new one? Without fees? Or lower?
@_date: 2014-04-27 11:41:35
No we don't need more jobs, we need more buyers. They are all just instant transferred to dollar anyway.
@_date: 2014-01-14 09:43:06
I hope he holds them until he can buy an island in carribic  :) 
Which I would find pretty cool. I would visit him and buy a drink or two in Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2014-04-08 16:12:16
It makes perfect sense, by increasing the entry barrier you prevent competition. They have good enough connections to by pass what every regulation which will come.
@_date: 2014-02-18 16:12:19
This is good news lmao 
@_date: 2014-10-24 09:17:58
I like to compare it with cars, how many safeties, rules and signs and how did it took until we "finally" had some ground rules and progress until now when we can say: Cars a kinda safe?
How many people died due to "no idea of how to operate and move" a car around? Yeah... a lot... and this is "just money"... it will take quit a while...
@_date: 2014-03-26 11:31:54
Awesome! Price drop :)
@_date: 2014-10-08 12:38:00
@_date: 2014-05-22 05:53:09
Oh come on, we just get easily excited and scared lol
@_date: 2014-02-04 12:45:41
That´s how facebook started, you know, the multi billion dollar industry, it´s all fun...... until...

I wish I could :-(
@_date: 2014-02-21 06:39:39
No no, please not, all the risk should keep with the buyer, not seller.
@_date: 2014-02-19 05:35:17
It's a free market, sell somewhere else. 
Ps. The same will happen to Bitcoin :-)

Selling GHs and not providing it would be scam yes, as much as everything else would be scam if you sell something you don´t have. 
I wrote already that itself "cloud mining" would not be a scam .
@_date: 2014-05-17 05:55:24
It is good news, it's a test for Bitcoin under tough situations. So far it looks bad though lol

I think we should buy a ticket to Mt. Gox HQ :D
@_date: 2014-04-27 08:24:30
Or the coins get returned and everyone sells them.because they are done with Bitcoin.

No, buy ads from google. Keywords could be (like)
inflation, money, tax reduction, tax evading, stable money etc.
Audience like: 14-30 years old. 
Income: Over 2K a month
I think that would be way more usefull than reddit
@_date: 2014-04-24 19:18:43
Yup, but I think fb will be greedy with around 2-3% fee plus business fees for chargebacks. So I guess around for shops it would be around 5-6 % plus two percent greed, ending with 8% fee.
@_date: 2014-06-05 15:07:36
HA! 99%

@_date: 2014-04-02 05:44:37
I think it should do that. It means long planning possibilities, new money supply and helps refreshing the chain.
@_date: 2014-05-20 10:07:06
The importan part:


tl;dr: The loweing of interest to zero will happen slowly and will start in the USA.
Edit: The implication what this means is far behind "Bitcoin could save us" this is far behind "fed" monopole. That is outright stealing money from the "poor"
@_date: 2014-08-06 10:25:09
80% holding, 10% losing (where is MY HD?) 10% spending. Thats Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2014-01-30 16:46:11
Well all the alts are slowly dying and everyone runs to Bitcoin. New coins don't take off as before. It is happening what we knew: Bitcoin wins :-)
@_date: 2014-05-31 10:36:00

Well it is a ponzi, all money is made by the first from the last poor guy buying in.
BUT: You can do much much more, with Bitcoin ponzi then with lets say a house ponzi or a "shareholding" ponzi. You can store, move, hide, transfer, lose, steal, encrypt and more with it. 
If I would need to draw a line how much ponzi is inside and how much "utility" is inside I would draw both as an "e" log. 
thats it will go to the moon it is perfect fir of greed (ponzi) and utility (usefulness) without the ponzi scheme no one in china would had started even to think about buying coins!
PS: To the moon and world domination and burn the states :)

Yeah a good interviewer asks questions a "dumb" viewer with an IQ of 60 would have in a way which forces the interviewed to answer correctly, directly and easy. (no bla bla politic bubbling )
And than steps up to more interesting question no one asks.

Well, if the price continues to fall. We don´t need to think about this anymore :)

That explained the price rise the last days. Either insider or they stocked btc
@_date: 2014-06-14 18:09:55
I guess it will happen a few times, much like China news. Until no one cares anymore. And some kind of 33%,33%,33% pool equilibrium is reached.

I'm shocked, I'm shocked I tell you lol

And no taxes, no forms to fill, no questions asked, no "we look into your account" and block your whole account! That's Bitcoin! Fuck yeah :-)
@_date: 2014-06-02 10:49:38
And the new mantra is: No bugs? You shipped to late
@_date: 2014-04-11 12:49:23
I know, it won´t happen becuse no one would agree, but saying banning won´t stop Bitcoin is just.. ignorance...
@_date: 2014-02-14 20:14:10
Right now it is pyramid, we need new investment (people)  To keep the price stable. Later on even all coins are mined we don't need new impact.
@_date: 2014-05-23 10:32:39
I acctualy think the same about ripple right now, it could help to spread the ripples accross owner.
@_date: 2014-01-23 12:41:23
The big question will be:
Will google create a "locked" version of Bitcojun / google / wallet. In a way to can use NFC / pay only to people useing there system too and they snatch a fee like anyone else. (Thats what I called out a long time before, fees will raise of even keep the same for licked-in off-chain transaction but in matter of seconds than). Yes yes down vote me again please.
Or will be google more interested in your data? What do you buy when? And transfer for free?
@_date: 2014-04-18 06:13:52
That's what I wait for :-) and Euro and lira etc
@_date: 2014-04-12 21:30:13

I'm alone who thinks that this is funny? :)
@_date: 2014-02-13 06:39:49
And many will do. You won't even have a private account key anymore. Just a big wallet with others together. Playing with the role: no one will withdraw everything at once they play erm invest the other Bitcoin. Double profit :-)

@_date: 2014-12-17 09:09:03


I don´t think it is "cartel" like. It more like a "we all profit from a situation like this, lets do it!"
The problem is with russia: there are A SHIT LOAD OF PEOPLE! If they get hungry (no food and stuff) they will start a war. They don´t fear to lose half of it citizens. They are just to much people over there...

@_date: 2014-01-03 19:06:20
On one side you are right. With more and more people on boat it will get harder and harder to get to a point. That's why ripple has a very very good chance by being centralized to be at least a tough competitor.
@_date: 2014-03-07 05:43:39
I do that too, that's not a proof.
@_date: 2014-02-26 10:49:29

Yup, the market penetration is just too damn high!
@_date: 2014-04-11 05:27:06
Long write short: 80% of moving bitcoins is speculation, so around 80% price drop. The same pressure which increased the is now the down trend. Everyone wants to be the first selling. 
@_date: 2014-06-16 16:35:18
Which has basically everyone here

And when will DDG build there own index?
@_date: 2014-01-20 06:49:17
No as it grows it will get harder and harder for people than firms than organizations and than cartels to manipulate Bitcoin because it is too big.
@_date: 2014-08-14 09:37:12
No it does not need to, it is a free market.
There was a book / study about open source and democracy.
To sum it up: Every time something goes to shit, it is faster and harder than without rules / rulers. BUT: It also adepts faster and better than other stuff. 
At the end someone will always pay the bill, either the state, the customers or the the firm itself.
@_date: 2014-07-08 09:16:19
The cost almost does not matter, as long the customer is paying for it! (Sellers wouldn't´t care less)
@_date: 2014-03-01 18:40:22
Good luck trying to explain that to humans :-)
@_date: 2014-05-25 12:49:12
Nah, that´s not a problem, Bitcoin is decentralized isn't it?

Even Germany? :p
@_date: 2014-08-04 10:36:34
It is not about making sales (it is nice if you get them via Bitcoin though) It is about exposing Bitcoin to the public. Until they accept it.I bet if Paypal / Ebay with show us there "how many used Paypal" in the first few years until a critical mass of sellers and buyers! Used it. I bet it would be also very, very, very, very low. Maybe even more disappointing than Bitcoin because you (at least) get enthusiast who use it.
And additionally: Holding is way more interesting and better than using it.
@_date: 2014-10-24 22:11:55
We don´t need the "normal" guys.

If they accept Bitcoin, why not?
@_date: 2014-04-07 11:04:07
a someone said: Money flows also to ideas. With a great Idea you can get a lot of money. For example Zuckerberg, he wasn´t rich, ok he got "already" enough money. But now he has A LOT of money. Or Satoshi, whenever he pays out he will be incredible rich. 
Sure, in the greate sheme of events, they are still nothing :)
@_date: 2014-12-03 14:22:41

@_date: 2014-11-20 09:08:18
Don´t even need to be like that, it could be also:


Depending of where you are you get killed for it, fined for it of get into prison. The value would drop to almost zero (maybe 1 dollar or so for nerds and drug users)
@_date: 2014-03-20 09:27:43
I don´t get it either, it is natural progress.
I don´t know why peple are so anti technology here?
I mean Bitcoin is pure technology progress, I wonder what will hapepen in five or ten years when alsmost no one needs to work on farms for example and all workers are replaced by robots.... That´s natural progress, nothing to fear here.
@_date: 2014-11-17 12:21:05
And we are luckily that Apple, Google, Facebook and co don´t dump there money in the economy or else we would face high inflation world wide.
@_date: 2014-03-28 06:40:54
The exact same thing would happen, everyone sells to hope to buy cheap back. Until then, gold would drop.
@_date: 2014-07-30 13:40:50

Your comment is fucking stupid, to use your words.
Maybe a lesson in history would help? look up how many people died and suffered in the crusades for example. In china, in times where "gold" was a standard.
Or maybe psychology? People are always people, no matter what system. 
We have two "proofs of history and science" which favors my point of view: nothing will change, just the money "system". 
Which proof do you have?
@_date: 2014-01-03 19:31:36
Dude, slow down. Forget what you know and ignore people and science, just live a happy live. 
This is an advice from me, forget human development, first we need to go through a phase of greed with Bitcoin. Just relax, buy some, get rich and enjoy life :-)
@_date: 2014-08-06 06:21:10
To the afraid part and banning:
The people who sit near the fountain (money) or laws are now in an excellent position: They buy early Bitcoins and claim: All is good! Don´t be afraid! 
Remember the senate hearing: Went much like this, the guy with coins said: No problem. Bitcoin is good! 
We will see this happening more and more as people in powerful positions and or much money will claim that bitcoin is no threat to states, money, banks etc.
And thats why I said the whole time: DON`T SELL YOUR COINS OR BUY SHIT YOU DON`T NEED! FFS
The rich already decided that Bitcoin is already there money. (Not in sense of they know they decided, it is is it´s network effect, much like Facebook, we all knew we will never use it, right?)....

Without Bitcoin I wouldn't be able to marry... she is from Africa. I dumped a shit load of money into different offices just to get the permit to marry.... Than the actual marriage... oh boy... lol. That's why I want Bitcoin to kill states. Corporations don't care who you marry or where you live or which skin color you have as long as long as you have the skills you need.

@_date: 2014-12-17 08:57:55


No, they know that money works like gravity, some know that as a "fact", some know it with there gut (they got rich by that fact) 
They fear the day that Bitcoin get so big (it soaked so much money up) that it will work like a blackhole. Soaking up the whole money from earth, globally in just a few days / weeks.  


See above.

I think people mostly don´t care about privacy. The only people complaining are on the internet and a little percentage of the global population.

You can't do that either with Bitcoin anymore. It is to big to reach consensus easily.bugs? Sure. Enhancements? Maybe. 
But true new features won't come anymore from Bitcoin. 
Will this end Bitcoin? 
Nope, Bitcoin will stay until it is totally useless.

If they feel left out in the game of resetting the currencies of the world. I would not be surprised that Russia will go to war. Just for the lulz and giggles.
They already try to find reasons to go war, VERY hard.
When russia goes to war no currency in this world be safe. Especially in the Eurasia region.

We are in market penetration and adaption phase, so what? 
P2P cryptography is mainstream now, by starting a new "mining" technology you attract thousands of GH´s and nothing left for the founders. To still have a "work/income" balance you need to pre-mine. 
And yes, founders of big firms want to make millions in just a few month / years.

In Germany we do the same. We added "calls from foreign country via smartphone" so we have something which dropped in price and other shady stuff. So we can say: no no it's just 2% inflation. While in reality I know no one called the last two years from a foreign county.

Yes and no, people are just still running and referring to mtgox, they build a semi monopole, that's also normal in free markets. To mining the same will happen.
@_date: 2014-01-12 20:21:34
No, for this to take off a lot of people would need a torrent like client installed, what do you think normal people will do? 
Also: three competing systems (name coin) doesn't work well. It need to be only one. 
And it's too late now. Even name coin didn't take off. 
@_date: 2014-01-02 17:23:52
Where the money goes? Well, ask Google, Apple, banks etc. Money behaves like gravity and matter. More money follows even more money. What is so hard to understand that? ( if you are not incredible stupid and invest 100% gold for example and just hold after / while a bubble pops) 
@_date: 2014-05-26 10:43:12
I wish had money and could hold until states collapse :)

@_date: 2014-05-17 06:40:19
Yes, but nobody beats drug payment around the globe in minutes. Or intel paying like two Bitcoin to foxcon for a month for all workers. That is where Bitcoin shines.
@_date: 2014-04-11 20:16:59
I understand it, and understand fully it´s consequences. And I hope they all the negative and positive consequences will blow up very quick (like in twenty years) i´d rather see humans die a quick death than slowly starve and have no idea why. 
With Bitcoin at least it will be quick and people will know why. :)

AKA: Not 1% own 99%, 0,2% own 99% :)
@_date: 2014-03-25 11:41:26
And that helps to keep the price low!
@_date: 2014-12-02 11:04:43
Haha me too :)
@_date: 2014-01-15 18:36:05
Limit of supply, soon or later even generating coins isn't enough and people will get greedy and stop selling if they notice 10bn are pumped in. So the price rises and rises. Side effect even more people will jump in. I think you just need 100 million though. 
@_date: 2014-05-28 08:09:50
I would say 20% rest in top ten share holding and a few houses in uk. 
@_date: 2014-10-08 05:29:59

@_date: 2014-01-20 11:33:48
Correct, with Bitcoin the "richest" people and Firm are in control. What is better a person / firm or state stands to be shown in future. 
How firms and people act in the last five years might be a pretty big indicator how the future will look like. 
If anyone is interested how the future will look like:
Shadowrun (just subtract the fantasy stuff)
Happy journey into a bright future everyone :D

Like, you know, real world. You always have two or more sides.

The problem could be QS though, it could vary in quality and the amount inside the pill. With "simple" pain killers it shouldn't matter. But what about more "complex" stuff?

No, but we are seeing different implementations of the protocol which will be usefull. 
The much cited call: Bitcoin is like TCP/IP is not that far away from the truth. 
For example BitID is one of the things to come were Bitcoin will shine. And a lot of other stuff. Has storage of pictures for proof. Contracts ect etc. 
That´s were Bitcoin will shine.
@_date: 2014-05-08 13:54:24
You are not alone, when Bitcoine xplodes, they will explode to an extend no one ever will thought it could happen. 
It will soak up money like a blackhole.
@_date: 2014-05-21 16:58:16
No, firms can buy power in bulk and move to cheap(tm) county. You will never compete. Only with losses. And you will never get the newest tech for mining. If you want to buy one miner they will laugh and sell to cex.

And you still can´t use it in Germany, tried it by sideloading it. Funny thing is: You get a complete english mail welcoming you to google wallet and how cool and useful it..
Not.. because you can´t open an account in google wallet in Germany. Lol
@_date: 2014-04-25 05:24:02
But does square has like 20% of all humans as costumers and users? Allows like instant setup? Including tracking of your customers demographic data etc?
@_date: 2014-11-26 14:18:27
@_date: 2014-01-16 12:02:49
As usual, democracy comes basically from there :)
@_date: 2014-05-07 14:57:58
Michael more, stupid white man, a book.
@_date: 2014-01-17 08:28:38
wow, they should hold them until they are worth millions.... per coin
@_date: 2014-04-05 06:37:29
Come to Germany :-)
@_date: 2014-07-23 09:13:17
I lost .. a ... few :)
@_date: 2014-05-15 15:50:49
Well I feel good and you? Lol
@_date: 2014-01-29 14:49:42
Vote with your money, buy Bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-04-30 19:47:55
That's what people don't want? To understand, it will kill all regulations and states as we know them.
@_date: 2014-03-27 15:01:24
When people switch off mining, difficulty will fall (within two weeks max.) after that, people will switch mining on again. When people switch off, and than try to gain control over the network (51%) attack. They will still way behind the necessary power.
What we will face is that we will have three (or two and a half) corps which will mine. No one will have alone enough power to control the network. And even if, they would destroy there own money. Which onlky happens if they want to see the world burn.
@_date: 2014-06-12 18:15:18
Alexa? Maybe
@_date: 2014-04-16 05:44:35
Very! Big!
@_date: 2014-03-06 18:07:48
Yup, and PayPal fees are paid by customers and all risk is on customer side. Cool eh? :-) it will go like PayPal viral, more and more merchants will accept Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-08-13 12:29:08
Ok looking into it, just signed up, what do they want to know? They want to verify email, verify phone number and what are the three other steps? Passport and such?
Well nevermind, just saw bitx.ng isn´t open lol
@_date: 2014-03-07 12:19:05
With the right words and keys you can be ervyone on the internet :)
@_date: 2014-01-03 05:28:19
Isn't that the point of Bitcoin ? Increasing the price with more people buying it?
@_date: 2014-05-07 15:34:27
I should create silk road 3 and scam people too.There is money on the street!
@_date: 2014-03-07 05:44:45
Post on reddit, earn money. No marketing needed.
@_date: 2014-06-18 15:15:46
So, how many Switzerland's will it cost?
@_date: 2014-03-06 09:58:18
You foget the increasing value per btc, so you buy 1, 1% value increase &lt;-&gt; 1% fees and no problem.
@_date: 2014-04-16 05:47:27
Haha! That made my morning a good morning, thanks for the laugh :-)
@_date: 2014-06-13 07:33:19
Funding with Bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-02-06 09:34:37
No lol
@_date: 2014-04-05 11:40:07
Expensive city. You earn more on your job but most of ite goes to your living cost :-) 
@_date: 2014-02-18 16:49:41
That's why it has a better position. Read up why states and countries developed. Hint: red queen effect.
@_date: 2014-05-23 14:29:47
This is good news, Bitcoin grows up!
@_date: 2014-08-11 13:55:52
In Germany some of the "big organisations" have 80%, even more, external employees (semi- permanently)
so if there it is 1000 people, you can add like 3000 external.
@_date: 2014-08-04 10:45:22
Greed combined with exposure drives way more people to Bitcoin than anything else.
@_date: 2014-03-04 17:36:59
Open source lmao, no
@_date: 2014-01-08 07:59:48
tl;dr: Make more money with low effort :D
@_date: 2014-03-27 10:29:35
The cost will be covered by increased transaction fees.
@_date: 2014-05-05 10:41:52
I think Ripple will have a very big chance to win on long term (red queen effect)
@_date: 2014-05-01 14:01:01
And all cars are owned by Google and Intel look
@_date: 2014-02-10 06:07:39
For basically one visitor you can get one for like five dollars. 
@_date: 2014-06-10 06:56:35
What about direct into the blockchain? Or side chain? Let's say you got a sensor in Paris for temperature. You have a side chain for "temperature in Paris" 80% vote of temperature wins. Than the average. Just an idea.
@_date: 2014-05-26 10:53:01
tl;dr: To the moon! :)
@_date: 2014-02-18 16:51:16
Yup lol
@_date: 2014-07-13 07:55:52
Because every seller a accepting Bitcoin increases the price.
@_date: 2014-02-05 15:29:09
no shit sherlock
@_date: 2014-02-05 15:28:13
To bad I got a lifetime license :)
And I must say: I´m very happy that malware still respects that code
@_date: 2014-06-01 18:19:51
Got job! One of the good features of Bitcoin. Transporting money illegally over borders. Nice one
@_date: 2014-06-23 10:48:31
Maybe mimocloud from Germany going online?
@_date: 2014-08-04 09:07:03
Since it is Bitcoin debt card, wouldn´t it easy to "resell" cards? 
@_date: 2014-04-14 05:54:27
Everyone wants more :-)
@_date: 2014-03-04 11:28:55
@_date: 2014-05-27 18:58:25
What about no? 
@_date: 2014-08-13 14:20:32
Uh, why did you bought ether? Just curious...
@_date: 2014-03-20 12:13:48
Yes, keywords but not meaning or even "new" words. That is what I mean understanding. That would need a HUUUUUGE DB or an AI.
@_date: 2014-03-19 16:19:51
Hear hear rare true words. 
@_date: 2014-12-03 14:24:22
Women? :)
@_date: 2014-12-17 14:19:29
BUY BUY BUY BUY! :)
@_date: 2014-06-09 21:14:39
I once discussed topics like this with a co worker, he said this and that. And I said: there will always be centralization, power consolidation, the will to kill and lie to archive that. He asked why? 
And I just said: psychology, humans are always like this. No matter which system. 
If that changes we don't talk anymore about systems, we will talk about freedom and leadership. Not about money, control or power.
@_date: 2014-04-04 04:29:48
Not a news, and for a good reason. All fees and risk is on consumer side. Already wrote about that. But I don't get top votes :-)
@_date: 2014-01-22 12:58:16
And you can´t read
@_date: 2014-01-27 07:44:02
Too early,  move the date after Summer.
@_date: 2014-01-03 19:44:42
Yeah, my ass, and humans will all be nice and help each other.... And everyone will live forever in peace and harmony... haha
@_date: 2014-12-20 22:17:51
Until people find out that facebook "sells" fake likes which will actually drive down engagement :)
@_date: 2014-01-25 08:25:00
And also cures socialism and all related useless stuff like health care. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 09:53:49
This is huge!
To the moon  :D
@_date: 2014-05-21 06:12:20
Wait, so I can copy whatever I want, make it malware and block "real" extensions by this way? Oh wow...
@_date: 2014-06-06 07:55:40
Yay! Consolidation is growing! Good job!
@_date: 2014-06-23 11:40:02
How should it improve without anyone ever complaining?
@_date: 2014-02-14 06:18:18
We are just on a way deeper, everyone sells now to buy cheaper later.it's not really a loss on confidence more like a capitalistic principal :-)
@_date: 2014-04-29 16:39:58
Yeah, an iq of 60 is enough :p
@_date: 2014-04-24 14:16:12
wow, good lord, kids with money in there hands....
@_date: 2014-04-21 18:50:28
It was never planned as decentralized, just idiots said it is. 
@_date: 2014-12-03 14:32:38
Well, I guess the hair shop owner is :)
@_date: 2014-03-20 10:53:47
hehe welll luckily they just "read" everything but don´t understand everything. That comes later when I´m dead :)
@_date: 2014-11-03 11:53:27
And increase of value! 
In ten years I will be rich!
@_date: 2014-04-26 05:45:06
What about just a shitty old tablet for just 100? Works like a charm. For example Google nexus 7 from 2012.
@_date: 2014-05-24 06:46:16
Yup, ten years max.
@_date: 2014-10-06 11:13:44
I see a new bubble forming! sweet :)
@_date: 2014-01-02 13:27:29
Why? DVD started also as "porn" medium, no one think about that anymore.
@_date: 2014-07-11 15:14:20
It is good, who the hack needs five pizza deliver services?
@_date: 2014-06-06 09:33:13
One step closer to a tax free future! YAY :)
@_date: 2014-05-04 12:01:56
@_date: 2014-03-11 18:38:57
People will still buy gift cards, just not with bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-04-18 18:21:05
Use of third party will be the future. Bitsramp, blockchain etc will probably create an instant payment api. 
@_date: 2014-06-18 13:02:45
Mining rig: 500$ 
Losing money for the next generation: Priceless :)
@_date: 2014-01-30 10:09:23
Uh? Whats the point? 
I think better would it be to make a raffle and handout toe gold (paid via Bitcoin for awareness) well whatever.
@_date: 2014-04-26 18:52:50
Drugs :)
@_date: 2014-02-14 06:36:25
And someone else gained it. That is why we are here :p
@_date: 2014-03-14 13:43:33
It is not, in the sense he want´s more money.
@_date: 2014-06-05 15:11:09
@_date: 2014-11-07 07:54:47
And suddenly, with the emerge of Bitcoin human mankind changed to a nice and truthworthy species...
@_date: 2014-06-16 16:36:34
Which has basically everyone here 
@_date: 2014-03-29 18:08:44
All hail anttoshi!
@_date: 2014-06-24 06:28:10
Sounds nice, but won't happen.
We need to take a step back.
@_date: 2014-01-12 23:13:11
Heard behavior of humans?
@_date: 2014-01-22 11:21:50
How much are they worth now?
@_date: 2014-05-11 06:10:25
Only? That's not much :-(
@_date: 2014-02-19 05:43:24
Litecoin and dogecoin :-)
@_date: 2014-10-23 10:02:56
Well, looks like a sell wave is incoming :)
@_date: 2014-05-30 05:54:01
I cents. Not that a normal user cares about cents..
@_date: 2014-01-15 18:04:59
As a German: I told you so lol
@_date: 2014-01-14 07:59:33
This is very freaking huge, imagine giant company.
5K people working there, you buy there Bitcoin on dips, save ten dollar per employee, per month.... go figure...
PS: I can´t get paid in Bitcoin, my company is too big ;( I guess we will be the last ones getting paid ;(
@_date: 2014-01-18 12:56:25
@_date: 2014-08-11 10:56:13
Yup, even Namecoin won´t survive at end, because it is much easier and safer to just buy domains from namecheap for example.
@_date: 2014-01-21 11:42:23
I pay five Euro, no matter the amount. Hm...
@_date: 2014-05-23 09:10:02
Noooo? How surprising, and next they tell us they want to control Bitcoin because it kill taxes and states -_-
@_date: 2014-05-28 11:58:29
This, this is what we need!
@_date: 2014-03-28 19:47:30
Yeah so it can be transferred directly to dollar via bitpay.
@_date: 2014-05-21 14:33:22
Future consensus decisions brought to you by: cex, btc guild and one or two others. Totaly ending the corp control!
@_date: 2014-03-04 11:28:21
Found them in wallet: 000000000000000000001 lol
@_date: 2014-03-04 06:17:41
Haha, that are Corporations make money and don't evolve :-)
@_date: 2014-01-08 20:32:10
Hehe, 
this is like a little nice test to see what happens i Bitcoins get banned :)
@_date: 2014-08-01 04:39:58
Working with and for banks. In Germany no one gives a fuck.
@_date: 2014-01-10 13:18:05
Conslusion: They make more money on falling prices, then "we" would do on sites like that. Or they would be out of business very quick. Aka: Gambling like a casino. 
But I think Bitcoin could be bad surprise for them, in general an always rising stock. A bad nightmare for them :D
@_date: 2014-06-09 10:35:53
Don´t worry, it will kill :
Fiat (dollar, euro, lire)
Taxes, states and the shit no one need
@_date: 2014-06-02 07:28:51
It was in the first few versions, later on it was possible to block them.
@_date: 2014-06-13 15:38:25
Bad idea to sell, very bad idea.
@_date: 2014-08-13 06:32:11
What was the reason?
@_date: 2014-07-08 13:58:31
Can you see when you joined somewhere?
@_date: 2014-04-02 12:49:54
Property laundering :-)
@_date: 2014-05-15 13:57:46
What about a server where yo connect for Information retrievel and processing? Is that possible? Key on MyCellium, information about "content" on mycellium.com server or wherever. 
@_date: 2014-04-15 04:31:13
Uh what about no?
@_date: 2014-05-02 14:17:02
Haha! too late when they are done :)
@_date: 2014-07-22 07:37:09
I am a long time lurker, when I grow up and be a start up I want to register :D

It does, capitalism don't work without money. (Printing)
@_date: 2014-03-28 05:38:50
Always! :-)
@_date: 2014-06-23 18:46:33
Damn bitcrack heads!
@_date: 2014-01-23 13:24:25
If 1% of of four! Trillion start to move to Bitcoin a shit load of others will follow. 
@_date: 2014-07-19 19:06:21
Soon or later we will have shared key accounts. 200 Bitcoin go in, 100 customer. With the other 100 the Bitcoin bank plays funny games. 
A good candidate circle or coinbase. 
Let's see how does that first :)
@_date: 2014-07-12 07:58:06
That's what all the its a bubble or tulip bubble don't get! You couldn't cut a tulip or house into smaller pieces! ( which are still useful!)
@_date: 2014-05-25 14:23:06
This is huge :-)
@_date: 2014-03-11 15:49:14
Does not make any sense... oh well,  people never makes sense I guess...
@_date: 2014-11-03 14:46:19
Why are you downvoted? Dafuq?
@_date: 2014-01-06 13:33:35
Oh wait, SR is closed
@_date: 2014-08-07 11:00:05
tl;dr : Nerds will rule the world which wants flying cars, robots, automatic cleaning houses and robotic nurses. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 07:41:35
No,  I will, kinda, they will treason me in future lol
@_date: 2014-02-03 14:42:53
No miner, but electric guy.
Does it smell burned? Did you heard a sound like paper when plugging in? Does it get hot / warm? 
Get an ampmeter and measure usage of energy before gate and than after gate (be carefull set highest amp /V first than go down) and follow the cords and see where it stucks. If the needed Voltage arrives the chip. Well, chances are it is broken.
@_date: 2014-01-16 05:34:53
Because banks aren't in charge and don't own the money. The bank owner are. Ace they own already enough money to buy every Bitcoin even at prices of millions per coin, they don't care.
@_date: 2014-02-23 19:36:35
It was my second, first one was greed look
@_date: 2014-05-29 07:21:12
No no it's decentralized!
@_date: 2014-05-24 08:31:45
Well, at least Bitcoin will fix that problem hehe
@_date: 2014-01-18 12:35:28
The fee will probably keep the same or even may rise. Why? Because
a) Greed
b) oligopoles in mining, you don´t pay xx pee, you can wait for ages..
c) More and more stuff will be done offchain, for example Bitpay might allow offchain wallet to wallet payment, reducing the amount of transactions more and more. Result? A shit load of unused hardware, what to do? Rise transaction fees. Don´t like it? Well then go back to monetary money :)
@_date: 2014-06-18 13:04:42
It is, Flattr was just a middleman which is cut out now.
Or will be
@_date: 2014-03-13 07:31:18
creepy... 
How did you found that comment? Search? Comment history? lol
@_date: 2014-04-28 17:37:39
Shut up and centralize
@_date: 2014-05-03 06:39:51
How the heck do you pay for that all? Early mined bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-03-25 15:56:23
TO THE MOON!
@_date: 2014-01-18 14:43:45
Yes and no, fewer people than now will be amazing rich. Will it cause trouble? Sure, will we be able to change that? No, so does that matter? Yes, be a parasite and buy Bitcoin while others hoard them (or start to hoard them)
@_date: 2014-06-15 18:59:29
So not surprising at all
@_date: 2014-05-31 09:30:49
And back in the good ole days you couldn't transport stuff around the globe in hours.
@_date: 2014-05-23 10:46:05
With magical decentralization! 
And magical human behavior fixing!
@_date: 2014-02-03 16:05:22
Doesn't work either...
@_date: 2014-03-11 16:11:18
And you show how unimportant Bitcoin is if you stop buying. If you keep buying at least you show constantly flow of money
@_date: 2014-08-11 06:15:38
This is a perfect fit!
Bitcoin makes is hard to trace and cloudflare does not hand out data belonging to botnet owners, hackers etc.
They are basically accused to "create, support and hide" the business they try to protect you from.
A really smart move by cloadflare!
@_date: 2014-08-05 08:09:46
No no, tribes in cavemen stage did´nt had wars! There was no fiat! 
There! you got it! HA!
Or Indiana tribes in America never had tribe wars about territory, the crusades never happened!
Because there were no fiat! HA!
@_date: 2014-07-21 15:25:38
Do you pay less when paying in Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-05-24 16:03:36
What do I get if I was right a year back or so?  That gox and bitstamp are losing coins?
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:47:37
This is actually good news, cheap coins and my coins are more worth lol
@_date: 2014-05-15 07:41:03
woah dude, now i got 11 :))
@_date: 2014-05-31 17:16:28
tl;dr: Prof. Stubborn still don´t understand human greed and open markets.
@_date: 2014-03-20 15:30:00
yes and we will suffer and pay in lives and blood for years (maybe generations) to come.
The good thing is this time it won´t be far far away. It will be around the world.
@_date: 2014-01-23 19:38:23
I would guess rush to door as soon it hits two or three thousand.
@_date: 2014-07-22 07:33:44
Especially the ponzi, pyramid and Porn stuff :)
@_date: 2014-10-26 14:57:56
Did I missed something? 
The rich pretty much controll everything right now. 
Not in a paranoid kind of sense, just, well sayin.
@_date: 2014-04-25 13:46:54
You vote?
@_date: 2014-02-13 07:17:29
Good enough for bars and little shops.People will always try to "game the system" and cheat or save money. 
always. Credit cards or Bitcoin does not matter. 
The cost at end after all "lost and double spend money" for a shop to replace by the owner of the shop because of thiefs will be the same or even a littlemore than with credit cards and there costs. BUT: Don´t forget the big picture: No banks, no states, no taxes :)
@_date: 2014-05-06 05:08:26
You people don't get it? Hmm? Without China bitcoin loses it biggest selling point. Worldwide money transfer. China is  worldwide the biggest export land.. 
@_date: 2014-05-17 07:10:55
Did you say May? Buy buy buy now!
@_date: 2014-06-24 06:40:20
Greed until we really suffer and Bitcoin is the perfect catalyst for that :-)
@_date: 2014-08-13 14:10:02
As said in other comment, ng is not available right now anyway ;(
@_date: 2014-05-22 08:44:03
No, no, wait until china bans Bitcoin again.
Than sell after everyone panic sold and buy back after the whales bought back.
@_date: 2014-02-24 15:51:48
Simple: Imagine you get one share for 1 BTC, the company sells his products for 0,8 BTC and you get 0.1 BTC per share. Than because of deflation of BTC the company sells for for 0.6 BTC per product, than you get 0.08 BTC per share, with every "iteration" you get less BTC, while you still paid one btc, So, new investors, ask yourself, would they still pay one BTC per share? 
@_date: 2014-05-30 15:16:43
And a lot more to get rich on :-)
@_date: 2014-06-24 19:42:39
Or the lone wolf don't give a shit and want to keep it for himself :-)
@_date: 2014-05-28 05:21:08
@_date: 2014-10-27 07:26:21
Well, it´s there building, they can kick you out as soon they see fit....
@_date: 2014-02-06 09:34:57
No lol

PayPal, did that. They just shoved adoption into the customer face with bots. The same can and probably will happen to Bitcoin. No refund, no fees all customer risk. Which merchant won't like that?

@_date: 2014-03-17 10:30:11
They, other services wil follow like bitpay with almost same fee structure. 
I am still baffled that people think with "Bitcoin" all will be good. The only real good thing is person to person and worldwide transfer without taxes. (Or only taxes) I am not saying that Bitcoin won´t be a fucking crazy huge success. Just that people should drop the pink glasses they wear right now.
@_date: 2014-07-31 15:39:00
No, the rich will be still rich and with collapsed states you need an agreed on payment. Which would be probably Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-06-04 05:45:48
Yup, when the floodgates open to the greedy masses it will be like an atomic explosion. Everyone hoping to get first in. Good times ahead. Bad times for fiat which will die on its way.

@_date: 2014-01-24 10:17:10
I´m not concerned about the premining. Bitcoin and many others did that too. 
I´m more concerned about the "usefulness" you could build the same on top of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-27 07:43:53
Yes it is, and btc increase in value but firms don't double increase in value, so they make less and less btc profit. You get same value over your back in dollar but in btc it will be less and less no matter what. Than a new guy comes to buy a share.why the heck should he pay 800 instead of what you paid of four hundred dollars? Now got it? 
@_date: 2014-02-14 07:42:57
So, what happened the last three times after price crashes where it went up and above? 
People sold to buy cheaper later.

@_date: 2014-07-22 10:38:16
Because they might offer chargeback.?
@_date: 2014-03-27 14:45:27
Both will increase: volume (amount of transactions) and the transaction fee. 
If it is still not enough to cover, than we are not enough at the "price/ hashing power" equilibrium, Which means: People need to switch off mining hardware.

That's not a reason. With Bitcoin everyone can claim that they donated. No proof at all.

I would say don´t apply laws at all. Just two: Taxes and consumer production related. Let the rest figure out by the market.
@_date: 2014-01-08 08:15:14
That´s what I´m telling all my friends to whole time, wait for the day when Apple pays Foxcon in China with Bitcoin. They avoid by this way so many obstacles and laws and taxes that they save a shit load of money (that will drive the price like crazy :) )

Kill everyone who they think own BTC? 
But I don´t think they will do it. The rich are the first to own BTC, they make laws and movement. Same things like in USA and Europe happened will happen in China and Japan.

Satoshi had a closed market / non existing. He created it. That is a difference. 
As someone said (here) if the founder of the Internet would have done "pre mining" it wouldn't had worked. That is correct. But now the Internet is in hands of single people and firms. 
that is just the way how it goes. Don´t like? Create your own Internet or coin or technology. 
Can you? than go.
@_date: 2014-01-04 14:28:03
Because money isn´t flowing to the poor people, it flows to a few medium rich and than almost immediately to two or one A cons and stays there. 
This means there isn´t big inflation because the big firms hoard money like we do with Bitcoins :)
@_date: 2014-01-06 12:16:14
Yeah, I think they won´t earn much, hoarding is way more interesting than spending right now. :)

CEX.IO: Two days before new dificulty (rising network power for sure) anyone sane in his mind would sell there mining power on cex.io right? instead they rise. Which sense does that make?....
@_date: 2014-01-06 18:14:42
I´m not complaining that Bitcoin is a ponzi scheme. Wouldn´t be it one. It wouldn't be a success (Or why should I mine for ages at "start", or keep Bitcoin or try to convince people to use it, if every bitcoin would be keep it´s value, it is part of the design)
In contrast to regular ponzi schemes, which don´t implosion or stop, they stop because of people stop joining or the state stopping it. 
You can exchange any Ponzi scheme out there with Bitcoin, the real value is it is "easily" tradeable. Which even makes if more than a Ponzi scheme. 
Many people call alt. coins pump and dump, while in reality they are nothing else than Bitcoin. Ponzi scheme of future money without limits :) While Bitcoin has first moving advantage. 
When we realise what Bitcoin is, (like a blackhole of money) it will be too late. I don't count on human mind realising what is happening and stopping using / buying it. ( My neighbor made easy money and than his neighbor and than his neighbor until everyone is on board :) )
@_date: 2014-01-12 13:00:31

I bet Dshinghis Khan also printed a lot of money!
I like how people think that a "system" will fix human behavior. 
Tip: You can´t, no amount of rules, economic changes, system whatsoever will change that just one guy (or ten, or hundred or thousand can drive the whole world into ground. 
The guy in Africa torturing people and killing masses will just do it with Bitcoin instead of own printed money. 
the only real benefit is that states and borders will start to fall and you can buy your phone in Asia directly or china. 
Thats about it.
What counts is the long run of two or three thousand years to come which will set the basics for a whole new economic and human "behavior".
@_date: 2014-09-02 10:42:04
All in all I think it will be a zero sum game for avaage joe when we switch to Bitcoin (he still will pay several fees maybe even a bit more than now) 
BUT: It will be global currency which needs to be maintained, thats a big difference. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 13:52:16
That too (maybe) but the biggest price drop happened when big and small firms (like overstock) started to accept Bitcoin. Dropping all the cost of transactions to Bitpay and the customers (around 3-5%) which males the "it´s cheaper than credit card argument invalid (while the firms will like Bitcoin, all the weight and paying fees pressed to customer? No rist on seller side? Fantastic!) ;)

Yup, but everyone can get rich, not like shares from Apple or Banks where a few get rich.
@_date: 2014-01-03 13:19:45
We would get "quick-transactions" from centralized priority full nodes. All nodes which are now full or full backup nodes would get a "high" priority. If they say "this payment" is valid, it will go through, even with just three or two confirmations.
@_date: 2014-04-25 15:22:22
Bitpay is the best way to put pressure on the price :-)
@_date: 2014-02-13 09:21:30
But it will happen, it saves money and time.
@_date: 2014-10-28 08:29:09
wouldn´t say scam, more like investing bullshit, useless crap. But a scam? 
That´s a bit harsh, as long as you get X GHs for BTC it is not a scam. Just useless hardware you buy.
That said, there is a lot of bullshit and useless stuff for sale. Or clearly failing shares of a company. And they are still on stock exchanges. Or lubes which will make you stronk... and many more bullshit which still sales. 
So I don´t see any problems with mining clouds, morally yes. But we don´t have laws on morale.

No matter what you will do, money will always flow to money. You can move a bit around and from bottom to top once in a while. But 90% of cases money flows to money. 
As my boss said: the real disaster is that people make money without moving a rock.

@_date: 2014-07-13 12:29:57
Well, but after a certain amount of dividing your brain says: this is pointless. But with Bitcoin the price drives higher and higher and greed allows us to us smaller pieces with same functionality ( hording and transferring). I hope you get what I mean :)

Hm, Mc Bitcorn would be cooler :)
@_date: 2014-01-25 08:22:50
Instant payout, while all the hoarders buy stuff they don't need. Mostly geeks which could get rich and a few years. While the elite keeps there Bitcoin. It is sickening and depressing.

Yeah, well she is right, as I said to one of my friends: I five years (maybe ten) it will be like a punch into there face for A LOT of people! 
They will realize that the world change so much in just a few years that things are possible which they blocked from there view and won´t be able to adapt that (maybe) a lot of people will commit suicide (lack of intelligence and lack of will to adapt and accept)
Things which still a lot of people thnk is impossible, won´t happen in "near future" which will change the world:
Super fast computing, AIs
Robots dishing you the dinner, lunch and breakfast in big franchise stores like Mc Donalds. (just one thing is lacking to make this possible: visual "reading" sensors and computing) when one franchise starts (for example burger king, Mc Donalds needs to follow to save money)
Bitcoin as the "go to way to pay" 
@_date: 2014-01-14 09:52:19
20% every two weeks isn´t enough? 
Whenever an agency calcualtes there cost, two weeks later it would cost 20% more. They simply can´t keep up. Goverments and agencies are just to slow to realise and do a 51% attack.

Drug costs will increase a shit load (a good start is the hepatitis cure) 
More stuff will follow and maybe 60% of humans will die at the end of century. 
But its not a bad thing, we all want that. And the earth especially needs it. We are far far far away from "good" transportation methods around the globe. WE JUST CAN`T FEED THE GOD DAMN WHOLE EARTH! 
Cheap and clean energy is also faaaaar away. We need either a war of people dieing or of hunger. As sad as it sounds. 
That´s the hard, sad, fact. 
And Bitcoin will be helping to transition between now and what ever will come after Bitcoin when we started again an economically and population grow over the next generations. 
Maybe we will learn from it, maybe not. (I doubt we will learn, but one can hope lol)

You got basically two types: SK (Stadtsparkassen, und Kreissparkassen) while most of the Kreissparkassen are under one hut (F-I for example) Stadtsparkassen are sometimes self ruled. Or a combination of self ruling and under the Kreissparkassen "hut".
Yes yes Kreissparkassen are sometimes self ruled two, but that will end in one or two years. Just a few left.

Makes sense, at least with gold. You go to gold when the world goes to shit. 
That's what I try to tell everyone here. If economics collapse no one will be able to us bitcoin, no Internet or not enough people have it. 
Gold on the other side?

I also have a tax question: If I buy coins. Sell them later for profit and then a day or two later buy coins cheaper. 
Do I get taxed on the profit or do I get taxed on profit when I withdraw?

That will change anything! 
No it won't, Swiss will still be a tax haven. So no worries guys.

This is even bigger than Ghash! :D
@_date: 2014-08-04 10:37:38
Whoever did that, they should cut out Google payment or Amazon (or even both) to increase sales.
@_date: 2014-07-25 04:33:37
Yeah, states are pretty useless. If the rich just transfer there money off shore basically paying zero taxes. And flying in eight hours around the globe. Transporting products in two days. 
With that, the point of states and there proof of existence ( pun intended) became useless.
So better no states at all than half shit for the rich.

Cheap workforce is all you need. Quality is ( sadly ) an after thought. 
As one CEO said: I'm not a socialist, I would move our production to some where else. But it would decrease quality.
But still, millions of jobs get out sourced every day.
Now add on top of the cheap work force a good education and you get china. 
If I would be the US or Germany or what ever. I would be  frightened. Very. 
On top of that is that more and more jobs move to automation or semi automation. 
Ah well, who cares.

I'm not saying it is likely. In is indeed very unlikely. 
But if something like just one atom bomb on china and the economy ends. 
Bitcoin is dead in that moment. 
But an event occurring and planning for it and telling people in the "economy crash" they will safe with bitcoin is sadly wrong.

You forget one thing: bitcoin could be a replacement for "normal" money. 
Today you have people like zuckerberg. Owning millions of millions of dollars. 
Then you have the Albrecht brothers from Germany, also owning millions of millions of Euro. 
Than you have bitcoin. Which could be the global currency. 
What needs or will happen when you merge two currencies? You will have people like satoshi owning 10% or even more of the global reserve. 
It is perfectly normal. That is how money works. 
@_date: 2015-08-19 10:43:19

@_date: 2015-08-11 14:30:51
What almost everyone will do. IMHO. Stop spending until a solution is found. 
Which will be IMHO that we all stick with bitcoin not bitcoin xt. Or do you think kraken and co would go all in? No way! Will they allow trading if it? Maybe, probably not. Cost to much time and work. And even if, who would risk trading it?
@_date: 2015-07-27 15:02:45
And is realistic that a lot of people die.
Everyday, no matter what. It does not mean we need to accept it.
But I see your point of view. 
I have the point of view that humans archive great things together and working together. Lead by intelligence and morale.
Your point is that humans archive great things by leaders who lead the masses.
Biologically both things work. And both things archive great things.
But here is some food for your brain: what do you think how the pyramids were build?
Don't cheat and look it up :)
Did they had a few smart people leading the construction and the people on the field were normal people?
Or did they all were skillful and intelligent and there were some guiding and organizing theme?
I bet you already know where this goes. But I also bet you thought that people on r field "were slaves or stupid" which is completely wrong. 
They all were all masters or skillful stonemets lead by guides and well paid.
And now think about what you said would imply, we will never build again something like the pyramids again. 
Which is OK, everything has its time. And I think the next 1000 or two thousand years will be a time of total capitalism. We must try everything :) 
@_date: 2015-08-07 16:17:49

Naah, no Problem your cryptocoins will be worth a ton after the world crashes back to stone age! Think about all the internet and network we will have without anyone maintaining them!
You can't talk about that here. If something like this happens it is basically the end of any kind of economy, especially cryptos. 
Only thing worth anything around be food and medicine.

The stagefright security bug basically allows any code to get root rights. Without the notice of the user.
The security flaw can be executed from everything which allows playing of media files. ( WhatsApp, chrome browser, MMS etc.  ) 
So far there is no real fix beside updates. Some apps claim to help. But that is only mms. And if they really help... I'm not so sure.

That's why it is so expensive. 
You thought the US or eu has tough laws around money transmitting and transfers. Than look at Nigeria's laws... Bitcoin won't help there.
But where bitcoin would and could shine that most of the people don't give crab about laws. They do what ever they want.

Be also realistic that bitcoin will centralize and have something like banks have.
Trusted transfer. You go to shop at amazon. You pay 1 btc via coinbase and your wallet is on circle. Circle tells coinbase that you got the money and that they pay coinbase once a day the money via one big blob. 
Problem solved and everyone saves time and transaction costs.

Nice shiny quantum's? Hm

No it won´t much drama, like on facebook. 
Like on facebook. They will come back.
@_date: 2015-07-27 12:24:33
Well if you like to keep people stupid. Good for you. 
@_date: 2015-07-28 15:33:54
I thought also it will be about a bug. Like you can have all store names with just one token or something lol
@_date: 2015-08-04 05:37:31
I'm not surprised. But you know who was first interested in mp3?
@_date: 2015-07-27 05:37:57
It has some kind of value. So, it has a purchasing power which translates to time power.
Therefore. Bitcoin has power over time! 
@_date: 2015-07-28 15:00:54
Let's you wonder where all those money goes..
@_date: 2016-02-12 14:07:46
The same thing will happen to bitcoin. So what? 
@_date: 2016-02-12 05:42:11
It should be now clear that bitcoin won't adept anything. 
That's why the Red queen effect could be a threat ( ripple for example) 
@_date: 2016-02-11 18:54:49
I just wanted to support you ;) 
@_date: 2016-02-01 05:01:58
Why should he? It works. There is no incentive to stop. 
@_date: 2016-02-09 09:01:12
What do you mean? That I wrote that because of the "crash"? 
I have that opinion since... ever. You might want to check my comments :)
We need a prospering world for Bitcoin to grow. 
When the economics crash, so will Bitcoin. It is just not big enough for now.
@_date: 2015-07-11 15:49:12
Nice background and better text position and I would be satisfied :)

Bots, alot of Bots. 
@_date: 2015-07-27 05:40:19
That's how firewalls in computers (should) work. 
Deny all
Allow port 80, 443
Who needs more ports?
@_date: 2015-07-31 12:13:28
I'm pretty sure we don't do it like the Greeks. We pay taxes and don't go to fill state pension with 45.
@_date: 2015-07-27 15:53:13
Lol I thought the same. Not that I think bitcoin will roll over the world if nothing better shows up or ripple wins the game because we are still discussing blockchain size in 2020 (red Queen effect, there is a reason why we form states and leaders) 
@_date: 2015-07-29 05:12:32
You will be bitcoininated! 
Fiat is not futile. 
@_date: 2016-02-05 16:25:11
Exactly, bitcoin doesn't have frauds. Only scams. 
@_date: 2016-02-14 19:30:45
Try transferwise :) 
@_date: 2016-02-03 10:29:29
I have no idea! But let's print money and put it into military and security!

@_date: 2012-05-13 17:03:07


How true, how true
@_date: 2012-02-09 20:18:02
Whats the problem by creating your own?
@_date: 2012-01-24 15:38:12
Well I guess, if someone would miss use BTC for this. And someone will here from it, the uncontrollable mass will go insane and will try to stop BTC. Sad, but true...
@_date: 2016-02-04 15:28:53
They want to keep it under cover until Sanders take over and then blame him. 
@_date: 2012-05-02 12:55:59
And uberrich early adopters :)
@_date: 2012-08-21 14:47:33
No, real in terms of real products and services. And not just a few of them. For example in EVE you could buy / sell products with ISK. You could sell ISK on ebay (illegal) but it legal to trade "real life" product for ISK. (legal) and EVE-Online is WAY older than Bitcoin. Does it make it a "realllife" valueable alternate currency? Or Lindan Dollars or how they are called? No. I hope and think that bitcoin will outgrow the problems and size of "normal" money. But will everyone "wait" and sit on his money? Or just trade around virtual money vs virtual money? Which will creates a bubble, like now. The question is: Will they keep doing it? Is EVERYONE patient enough to wait? Who knows... (I dont think so)
@_date: 2016-02-08 20:28:55
Bitcoins value also dropped. That's how related they are ;) 
@_date: 2012-01-24 21:40:27
I dont get it? Why should I vote?

 Yeh, but if I like the content. I would donate BTC to the creator. Not the one who submitted the link...
@_date: 2012-05-22 09:29:01
Iam the only one thinking that Bitcoin will be a "money type" for world wide trade. Just like any other money? But instead driven by states it is driven by corporations? I dont know if this is a good thing...

@_date: 2012-02-29 06:39:28
Well, thats it, Bitcoin will die :)
@_date: 2016-02-08 20:47:46
Bitcoin needs a stable world to grow. 
To run bitcoin you need: other users (which bitcoin lacks right now)  internet ( which will fall apart in black Friday event. 
Power, which also will fall apart on a black Friday event.. 
So it is smarter to invest into gold or shares in from weapon producers and mining companies. 
@_date: 2012-06-22 14:57:51
I dont see Bitcoin as an investment, just something to play around. Like magic cards :)
@_date: 2012-03-05 15:44:34
thx did, hehe :)
@_date: 2016-02-11 18:47:33
My phone and my computer and digital assets will be the last thing I will look for when shit hits the fan. 
Bitcoin needs a stable and prospering world to grow. Get off your high horse and help to make it happen. 
@_date: 2012-06-01 20:10:38
Why trade everything in Bitcoin? Start with just enough to "trade" on this island and slowly increase (if needed) put the rest into whatever you think is "stable" enough (imho gold,silver etc and no local money would be stable enough) but still best bet would be gold. Give it a lawyer or something like this which trades 10% per year into bitcoin. Just an idea.
@_date: 2012-05-12 09:27:57
Wait? What? They use Windows server?
@_date: 2012-01-10 18:56:53
wow, just 0.1 BTC pretty amazing!

I second this, better me then anyone else :D
@_date: 2012-08-21 13:46:11
Damn I whish I had the money to place a "bet" (hehe double joke) IMHO gambling makes a shit load of money (and will) counting in that Bitcoin prices will raise... darn it :/ I got only like 3 BTC ;(
@_date: 2012-03-04 12:42:05
Well, there is another thing I dont understand. A shit load of money on a VPS? Come on, you nead a real dedicated root server for such kind of buisness. It is not a "big news blog site" whatever. Where a old backup is just enough...
@_date: 2012-06-28 11:08:14
Or not, Freicoin is likely to fail. What do you the think the average joe will think about Bitcoin after Freicoin failed? Hm?
@_date: 2012-08-21 13:50:09
I second this, I think also that it will get back to around 6$. There still no "real" value in Bitcoins (I like it and it might get it, in 10 years or so) but until this it is a long way. The question is: How long will people wait or are willing to wait to "something happen which makes Bitcoins valuable" 
@_date: 2012-03-11 08:45:30

Everyone with half brain and greed will hoard. 
Everyone with half brain and hope will spent.
Everyone else should do the same as with "real" money: Spent some and save some money / invest.
The funny thing with bitcoin is: You just need to "not spend" the money to invest ( in theory) hehe

@_date: 2012-06-21 09:17:14
I got 4 BTC when they were like 3 Dollars worth, well I guess I will wait till BTC drop under 5 $ again, then I will buy again. To say the truth: I dont have much faith in BTC, just enough to buy when they are cheap :)
@_date: 2012-01-22 16:48:34
But what would happen if two guys get the same address? And I send money?`(even the small is like the revive of jesus)
@_date: 2012-01-25 13:26:07
Jeh but still kinda "useless". If you would divide the "won" money between the creator and submitter. Your site might be useful. Validation could be done like google: DNS change, meta key on website. If it is a "big" site with own income. Like google, msn or such. The money could go to a pot and donated to charity things (EFF, red cross...) maybe even voted like the rest of links
@_date: 2012-01-10 18:51:55
We are humans, we are greedy, we are stupid. So yeah, he could be right.
@_date: 2012-06-22 09:46:54
So, how is the "traderate" ? Do people really buy there?
@_date: 2012-03-05 12:24:33
thx sounds like an interesting point. You know any website /blog which write / wrote about the stand points from different firms, banks, politicians, how it would change our laws?
@_date: 2012-05-25 07:21:30
At the point where "my money will be useless" No one will have energy, PCs, Network access to ensure "save" Bitcoins and trading. Think about it.
@_date: 2012-03-09 08:45:19
And? So what? Apple is doing the same...
@_date: 2012-05-14 04:26:24
Building unique things is hard on the internet or you build high risk things like "bitcoin"
@_date: 2015-04-11 08:39:01
You can do something like that.
Coinbase: I deposit 1 BTC, another dude deposits also 1 BTC
Another guy: Loans 1.5 BTC.
Coinbase hoping that both guys above don´t want there money back at the same time.

I can tell you that in Germany banks are merging or closing down because the cost of compliance is so high that even established banks can't pay it! 
Just let that sink in...
@_date: 2015-04-01 17:35:23
Yeah thought so. They rejected three different credit cards. Well, I guess they don't want my money.
@_date: 2015-09-27 05:59:21
just costing a few million dollars and a few years! Totally easy :)
@_date: 2015-04-13 05:26:56
Even not a third party app out there? Which can do lock time?
@_date: 2015-04-11 08:37:01
no, we have a money flows to ideas business. (well and execution) what do you think where Zuckerbeg and co came from?
But nonetheless, yes. Bitcoin will slightly change the things. (Also an idea, where. As written above. Money flows to like matter to matter, gravity) 
@_date: 2015-04-14 16:38:10
With that we could remove taxes and pay only what you need and when you need it! Hell yeah!
@_date: 2015-09-16 05:37:25
Got two, one had the name of my wife. 
How the possible fuck did they got it? 
I never used her name on any btc related service. 
@_date: 2015-09-16 15:35:16
Yeah, strangest thing is they addressed my wife's! Name. I never used her name anywhere bitcoin related. Not even with the email address. (I got two emails on two different accounts) one addressed my wife, one me. 
They somehow bought from several data brokers ( legitimate and illegal I guess ) or else they would never be able to make that connection.

They had users, not a lot though. They spammed sellers acting like interested buyers claiming to use PayPal. 
@_date: 2015-09-24 18:24:47
So, wouldn't that mean they won´t do it. Because they would harm there own market?
Like a 51% attack, no one would do it because it would hurt your own investment?

I must admit, I'm with him. Smaller block size should be the way to go. Right now a lot of things are broken in the network. Smaller sizes will help to clean up this mess. Which will lead to a cleaner block and smaller size. Probably also less transactions since firms and people will collect more transactions into one.
@_date: 2015-09-11 05:44:24
You are right. In my world. Where everything is about money. ( literally) customers pay us to do stress tests. What happens if this host switches off? What happens if this server goes offline? What happens if a full rack goes offline? 
But in bitcoin. How do you stress test studying with a huge size? And increasing? Who will pay for that? 
Truth is: no one will. But another truth is: someone needs to do it. No company with half a brain will get into a system where it is about money where there was/ is no stress test. 
Now when a customer asks: are there stress tests? We can say: yup, and they are self regulated and community driven like the whole system! 
The idea itself will be hard to grasp! But maybe one day they will get it and will be more open to it :)
@_date: 2015-04-06 07:10:46
Probably investor thought it is to early for a complete open api?

Still doesn't explain how they got the name of my wife.
@_date: 2015-09-11 06:16:04
Any idea about what he is talking? 
@_date: 2015-09-24 05:22:43
Or rent a vserver.
@_date: 2015-04-24 08:03:28
I would rather see a separation of state and corperations (lobbying) but I guess with bitcoin it will get worse. But better than war.
@_date: 2015-09-03 05:05:18

Holy shit! That could be it. My wife and me are on mailchimp (I have my own list there and her address is there.) But how did they made the connection from mailchimp to bitcoin? The newsletter is not related to bitcoin at all...
@_date: 2015-04-10 05:24:25
Imho we won't need to increase blockchain size. More and more transactions are offchain and centralized anyway. Aka circle, bitpay and co. Next step is offchain between kraken and bitpay and you can scale to billions of users.
@_date: 2015-04-15 05:19:11

@_date: 2011-05-24 09:06:46


Last post is from last year ;(


No no, not a human readable address, could be also a good idea,  but I mean more like SMS on phones. So you see in Bitcoin client something like this:
income: 0.002 BTC message, bought a snicker at shell. Something like this, so you know as a customer and as seller where your money came from... the message could / should be  shown in both directions...
@_date: 2015-04-01 15:13:21
In ten to thirty minutes? That would be hell of a crash
@_date: 2015-09-24 05:34:55
And then they and you realize that you almost pay as much as with PayPal. 
A funny world of going circle :)
I will say it again: the only thing which will set it apart will be that you can use bitcoin worldwide! 
That's it. And this, in itself is huuuuuuge. It is bigger step than it seems anyone here realizes. Or are just to greedy to realize lol

@_date: 2015-09-22 10:48:05
You know, vendor lock in and only "this" way. It should be done existed before bitcoin. And will exist after bitcoin. 
And if we are out of luck. None of the big ones will ever accept bitcoin ( because of lock ins) they want there users to stay. And be the only one to offer that service. 
A good example is Germany. Mobile payment is possible in many shops.
Problem is: every shop has its own payment app. 
And I don't see it change anytime soon. 
@_date: 2015-09-30 05:49:02
HM not really, but yeah part of it could be true. Even I think Sokrates thought about what happens if someone is invisible.  
If, at all it will just show humans true nature.  Nothing bad about that.  That's how we got where we are now :)  evolution and survival of the fittest :) 
@_date: 2015-04-14 16:46:11
Yeah with Facebook it will show your pictures or comments to people who shouldn't see that.
With something like bitcoin in the background, a lot of money can get lost.
@_date: 2011-11-15 07:36:40
For me Bitcoins have a real world value. A value which is attached to goods. I think it is around 50 cent to 80 cent. And a trading card game value. Which is the actual price. If you buy or sell "coins" you hope others might think they have a bigger value then now. With every news about a "worthless" use case from bitcoin (hacked site, massive sell out, dropping bitcoin use on a shop etc.) the value drops. To increase the value in bitcoin we need "constant" good news over a few months. But this is not happening. To many bad news. So bitcoin "traders" keep them selling until they drop to the "real" value (50 cent).  Based on this view, I dont excepted anything else then a dropping price. (Ignoring the reason) At this moment a few enthusiast keep the price (flag) up. But they cant do it forever... If we want a "good" future for Bitcoin we need three "simple" things:
Future: Increasing use cases for Bitcoins
Ads: We need to get the "normal" people to know about Bitcoin
Clients: We need more and better integrated clients (Better GUI, Browser Plugins, Smartphone apps etc...)
Good luck guys :)

I'm living in Germany. Aldi, netto, rewe won't take credit card. 
But I think aldi started to allow them a few month back. We Germans are very progressive :)
Edit just looked online news are around end of June that aldi and lidl start to accept credit cards. I'm not digging into it but probably no nfc. 
OK checked, was curious lol. They allow nfc. 
But yeah, we Germans don't like progress :)

So, basically Google and Apple? They are pretty much alone in there market.
@_date: 2011-05-21 16:07:23

@_date: 2015-09-29 07:42:54
Solar panels or laser technology.  For us it was never good enough.  We kept developing it for years.  Then we started production and the chinese made for half the price.  
Now the same with electric cars.  We Germans don't like the battery.  To long loading time.  Might burn up the car, to expensive etc.  In a few years we will fix what we don't like and the Chinese will again make it cheaper :)

I see it like a trading card game, I guess because I played magic ALOT ;)
There will be the time where it fail, like cards get missing. Bitcoins will leave the system. And sellers and or buyers will enter and leave the system. IMHO it will be never a "second" currency. And the price will raise until people like me lose interest. Then it will become "stable"

@_date: 2011-11-15 15:15:54
I think you misunderstood what a real world value means. Lets say people dont care any more about gold. About all its glory and shine. Only about how well you could use it in tools and electronics. The price would fall to oblivion. You would only pay what it is worth and this is what could happen to Bitcoins (if we remove the "gambling" from it) and dont see an increased use case.
@_date: 2015-11-01 18:12:26
The funny thing is, what happens of people don't put money into it?

In fact. It is. 
You know what is funny? 
12 million Africans are on the way to Europe. And no one will be able to stop them. 
They are desperate and suffering. Like die trying or reach Europe. 
The only way to stop them is to feed them in mass and give them a good live or an atomic bomb. 
Because neither will happen, we will suffer the consequences. 
It will be definitely interesting to watch :)

@_date: 2011-05-19 13:41:33
Well, I guess in a few days almost stop mining if this keep on...
IMHO the algorithm which "create" bitcoins should consider also how many bitcoins are out there, we have now the problem that more people try to create bitcoins, which increases the difficulty. But we do not have enough bitcoins out on market to satisfy the need, result? Increasing prices. Bitcoins just crowd to fast... (or mining) kinda funny that normally increased mining activity in the world leads to lower prices...

And it will be even more funnier when the people realize they will have everything like before all over again (paypal, banks, escrows, credit companies, banks which works your money while you "store" it etc.)

It is not from no where. You get rich by other people perception of value of bitcoin. What they value and how much is still to be discovered. 
In my humble opinion, bitcoin could be really with billions per coin because there is no base value.
So the base line is just greed and the value of network usage.

The big question is: will bitcoin be big enough to suck up the rest of the money and leave the states without money for war. It is all about mass and gravity with money. What will have more mass? Bitcoin or fiat? It will be interesting to watch and unfold!

My wife works in one refugee camp in germany. Most people she registers are coming from states who have no trouble there at all. Just economical reasons to go here. 
The sad is that people will prevent real people with real war to get help or get the help quick. Now even the people with real reasons to come will be seen as invaders. 
But I'm pretty sure of two things : 
No one will be send back. 
And we won't shut the borders.

I know there is no endless growth, so what need to happen? Economic total crash? War? An epidemi? Or bitcoin which will slow down economic growth by 60 to 80%? Or even reverse it and will kill on its why millions of people by starving and lack of health care. 
I for one would choose bitcoin. 
But playing everything will be like a nice a shiny place where we humans will be nice to each other and will help each other is just blunt lie. Nothing will change the fact that always a few will profit most. 
Bitcoin will kill states, I guess by that we will see an increase of religion communities. As a human hedge versus bitcoin and a stateless world. ( humans like communities) later on I think they will either die or merge into a corporation state. 
But all in all it does not matter, for the next state after bitcoin (or something similar) you need a stateless world.

No it doesn't have to!  How often I need to repeat it: most of bitcoin transactions will be internal or behind closed doors. For example Kraken with coinbase or coinbase US to coinbase Euro.  They could have billions of btc "used" and not a single real one moved.  Or even need to exist. 
@_date: 2015-03-03 11:27:20
A gold standard isn't a solution to a problem. It just decreases the incitive to innovate and increase production volume. 
But making sane economic decisions aren't a human thing. We do whatever profit us most.
In times of states, money printing is a smart idea. (As long as you are printing it) because you increase your wealth a lot in a short time. Bitcoin is driven by the same idea. Just without states. It just changes who profits. The game doesn't change, just the players :)

Yeah, but sometimes people are just stupid.  
Recently a new high quality, high price African shop opened near by.  Wife was happy,  because it is closer.  So she went and took a look.  She went a second time and wanted to buy something.  Owner complained she didn't buy anything the first time decided to not buy anything. 
Several flaws here: the shop is in a town with low population 
The people who live here have basically no money (jobless)  
No bypass traffic for impulse buying
On top of that the owner is rude.
And there goes like 20.000$ down the drain.

Uh? What has a ten times price increase with inflation to do? People are stupid enough to pay so much for just the name. That had zero! To do with general inflation which is very low right now.

That is what I'm saying from the beginning..  In future 90% of transactions will be off chain,  maybe more.  What people don't get is: when it is like that,  the underlying infrastructure or name or whatever does not matter at all anymore.  You could them than coin coin,  or whatever you like.  
This will have several effects I'm to lazy to explain. 
I think I explained that two or one year ago... 
@_date: 2015-02-26 06:15:45
While we are going full circle with firms like coinbase. Oh the irony!
@_date: 2015-02-07 16:55:14
You forget that this money isn't long in fluctuation. Inflation also happens when the money circulates for to long. But in the case of EU and USA the money almost instantly transfers either to the rich or big firms, for example apple or Google.
@_date: 2015-02-14 18:28:30
Couldn't they just call them : coin coins? Or something? No need for bitcoin, no? 
Also I'm not surprised,  more and more businesses will do the same or similar thing.

I think people here are mistaking I economical deflation and I inflation with the inflation and deflation of the snowball system we have right now. 
Sure deflation works great in Swiss because they are surrounded by states with inflation driver by cheap printed money which will immediately  sacked up by Google,  Apple and co. The result is a bad economy. (money is not reaching the normal people)  while to much money is printed which has no correlation to the increased monetary income of normal people.  
Swiss is lucky in three ways: they are small,  which makes it harder to get money soacked up by a few frims. Second: they are surrounded by inflation states who are using the Swiss for tax and parking purposes. Third : they don't need to print a lot of money. It fluctuate way better than anywhere else. (for the two other reason)

Bitcoin will scale, with or without improvements. More and more stuff will be offchain or be done like banks with clearance houses. Imagine bitpay and coinbase paying each other via api completely without the use of any bitcoin. 
Scalability isn't an issue, or speed of payment ( coinbase and bitpay) could pay each other in seconds. 
Bitcoin needed to be accepted and used.

Yup, saving is transaction fees and total control of your money by coinbase. I guess other firms will follow the lead. 
I wonder when coinbase and bitpay agree on an off chain transaction api. What do you think? One, two or three years?

I will just repeat what I wrote weeks back: It will go up to 150-170$ (Ok didn´t thought it will take that long) looks like people are still very careful now. After that it will fall down to very cheap point, I guess really around 30$-50$ because we still have the problem that bitcoins are just traded, well between traders and nothing else (almost) but well lets see who will be right :)

@_date: 2013-04-18 16:17:37
unlike the early adaptors which just mined and then just could keep a fie on hard drive = almost Zero cost compare this  to a huge website... and as I said I bet they slowly reduce this amount (80%) because they need to pay there bills. Except they have VC or someone paying all there bills which I dont think happens. Not that I like ripple. Specialist exchanges are way cheaper, faster and more trustworthy and almost do the same.
But just someone calling out for scam because he is holding back money (which isnt even worth something right now?? Or is this RPX something worth right now?) is a bit overacted imho.

Nevermind what I wrote! I changed my mind! It is good that the blockchain will grow into TB of size. It will prevent people who dont know what they are doing storing that file.

Nope, if you want to know what happens maybe read Neuromancer. It is amazingly accurate and close to "how humans" / nations would act in "freedom" of money, laws and etc. 
Incl. Killing competition by well killing employees. Stealing information, breaking in etc. etc.
Also you should read about the behavior of money (it acts like Gravity in real world) and Bitcoin won´t change that behavior. It might switch Positions. For a while, but Bill Gates will keep very, very, very, very rich, because he will buy just thousands Bitcoins which also leads to own increased wealth. 
The only good thing Bitcoin has it is a currency for worldwide usage. Which will help to develop a world government in a thousand years. When the biggest of all bubbles burst. (That we need money)

No we don´t need. Money and greed speaks for them self :)
@_date: 2013-07-15 10:49:30
Yup I know, but still, human (psychologic) rules are nicely applied. 
@_date: 2013-05-29 06:55:08
Uh, why not save it? Bitcoins are rising in price, better spent real money.
@_date: 2013-05-10 13:24:07
Thats why hoarding is so cool and the best way to earn money :) Ultimately soon or later your money is more worth! I like it :D
@_date: 2013-08-25 12:14:21
Well, then why not make an "tv box with xbmc and wifi over bitcoins?" Would be cool for hotels each room one of those boxes :)
@_date: 2013-08-20 13:27:17
My oh my :) Dear god the price will rise like shit in near futur from people like you buying in :)
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:53:12
Not yet lol
@_date: 2013-11-23 22:14:09
 They sell step by step while it grows. Not many people have thousands of bitcoins. Or if they got they sell in charges by 1000 and then by 1400 for example.
@_date: 2013-10-29 09:57:18
yup! :)
@_date: 2013-12-10 13:44:24
Well, it will make them a nice dime until it vanishes and be replaced by Bitcoin :)

Wow, gox will be richer than God
@_date: 2013-05-13 04:48:57
Im very sorry, but I didn't 
@_date: 2013-10-22 12:45:05
I say it´s not a bubble, more people joined (china for example) the price rises its that simple.
@_date: 2013-11-28 10:22:46
Yes, but you paid "one coin" for a share. Which yields less and less coins per year.
@_date: 2013-11-20 11:41:31
You won´t get rid of speculators.
@_date: 2013-06-18 07:15:30
Maybe we should change that sentence with Bitcoins, you cant throw them. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:37:19
haha, and tell them it will open a secret file. How long do you think a 12 year old guy could resist? Lol
@_date: 2013-06-06 19:21:52
If you want to take Bitcoin serious you should have stayed to an objective truth and balance.
@_date: 2013-10-23 07:28:12
Its not a bubble, more people joined the boat. Price rises. Maybe it will drop a bit after the first hype. But not crash. 
This time we have a reason. (More people, more trust, more greed :) )
@_date: 2013-06-28 17:04:53
I work at a pretty big IT firm, we sell B2B. We sell almost everything and have experts on almost on every area you can think of. I bet if I ask 100 people I would get 80 times: WTF? What do you want? 15 Times go away, and 5 know more than its something from internet geeks no one want to use.
Edit: But I still think Bicoin will still sykrocket one day, tax evasion and easy transfer is just to delocous :)
@_date: 2013-09-07 14:12:25
Well, at it is really like that. If you break down money to the simplest lowest meaning it is just a value to value something else. odd hm? But until we understand that money isn´t needed, because you can value work with other things. That will take like 10.000 years. The time we needed to separate religion and state, the next step is separate money and state. The next step will be separate work and money. Then the last big bubble bursts. Bitcoin (or something similar)
Until than lets enjoy the ride :)
@_date: 2013-10-25 06:28:46
No, its perfectly normal to create and use "me too" technology. And try to promote it. Most of them fail. Some succeed and some fail and still make money. (Most of the time more than, in this case for example than Bitcoin because they get all the transaction fees)
@_date: 2013-11-25 07:12:10
Yes it is
@_date: 2013-05-07 17:01:29
And here we go, firs step :) I told about this  months or weeks ago, there thousands of kids doing this. Don't worry, you are not alone wasting energy, money and time. You just increase the difficulty and strengthen the network! Thats good :)

no no there is no bubble. going to bed and wakeing up with 30$ increase is perfectly normal!
@_date: 2013-09-28 11:17:22
Oh yah, gread idea to invest! Buy shares of GHs and see your share drop in price every two weeks! :) Better buy Bitcoin directly.
@_date: 2013-05-12 19:01:58
Bubble is still going on
@_date: 2013-09-17 16:08:37
There is no irony in it. We all want to make money. If we can save money. We do, if we can make more money, we do. So what? I dont see there any irony. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:41:03
Bitcoin is a cure. To greed. But not in terms that it cure it. It creates it. We are humans and we desire and want to be greedy. But it is not easy or allowed right now. So we grab our hands on Bitcoin as something where we can be greedy. Almost without risk. Because others are greedy line us. But first come first serve.
@_date: 2013-06-07 14:19:47
Nothing, lol
@_date: 2013-04-15 06:28:57

I still wait for the day when Bitstamp or Mt Gox get hacked. No one can tell me they are 100% secure. Will be a fun day seeing millions of Bitcoin going down the drain and no one can do a shit. (Maybe it already happened but the hacker is smart enough to just withdraw here and there a few Bitcoins.)
@_date: 2013-04-15 08:27:28
wow impressive! I might try to setup one for my girlfriend she sells self made bangles combs and stuff.

Next Generation wont be like that :)
@_date: 2013-09-22 16:38:03
Yeah, but I bet the Group will just righteous reject legitimate expensive beings. That's we have such "big insurance" firms. A whole set of group can´t have the money to insure lets say a house. Or everyone would need to put a SHIT load of money into it. But who wants that?
@_date: 2013-07-18 13:22:25
The price was held artificial, one or two guys were trying to hold up the price, reason? I don't know. But they did this for weeks. Until the market accepted that price (around 90$) I guess the effect is degrading now. This happened two month or one month? (when did it start to float around 90?) 
@_date: 2013-06-09 08:56:58
Human psychology. Ripples are a profitable, dangerous "gaming" system. Humans like stuff like that. And its easier to use. Register, buy sell in an instant and its controlled by one organization. We humans tend to prefer systems with "hard" rules and one leader (organization) 
If you need to explain how Bitcoins work, yif you need to explain who own Bitcoin you need one hour. If you need to explain who own Ripple you just say opencoin. Easier
@_date: 2013-08-22 04:25:23
Bit it will happen (it is already happening) even right now... 
@_date: 2013-10-28 09:05:19
tax reduction and tax evasion is perfectly normal. Everyone is doing it. Bitcoin is just a "nice" solution right now. 
You could say: Oh boy, what about streets? 
Is say: CEO´s show how much they care, Google shows how much they care, Apple shows how much they care...
You know how much I care then? None at all.
As a economic psychologist said: The fish stinks from it´s head. (CEO´s, Google, Apple etc. ) people are just doing what there bosses show how to act and do. 
So, why should n´t I jump Bitcoin to evade taxes like the big ones? 
Because I don´t create jobs? Oh please... they don´t care about jobs. So why should I?
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:40:24
Who the heck would be that stupid to sell all his coins? Devalue his own money... no one, and even if, everyone else would get dollar signs in his eyes buying them.

Just a small fee 0f 0.5%... wow. You gonna get wealthy, very wealthy :)
@_date: 2013-09-04 20:06:00
Every system which needs more energy ( Im not talking about money) than needing to sustain and do what it needs to do (in this case "generate" bitcoins and sign /check transfers) is doomed to die or crash. 
While in this case the network will have a tough time to keep the shit together, they will switch "at first glance more profitable" coins for example or sell their power directly outside of the network or switch off. Many many scenarios are possible.
You can just ignore what I wrote you just keep going. Not my cup of tea. 
@_date: 2013-08-05 12:08:47
I hope you guys think about the payment for Blizzard and Valve and co, they want to see some money too :)

@_date: 2013-04-16 14:00:03
Yeah, you are right, Im sorry ;( It wont surely grow slow like that. Just wanted to bring my point across: Slow grow should be the target. With every bubble we gain traction and lose Vendors, banks, big firms, trust, merchants....
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:24:38
That's why Bitcoin isn't money for the poor.you stop spending them. But firms will be happy to pay bills in Japan from America with it :-)

Because I transfered the money to my bank account. When I transfer back its to late for day trading and making money.
@_date: 2013-08-20 13:08:50
I agree, let others spend the bitcoin. Hoarding is helping to increase the value, if "everyone" starts to spend the price would drop below zero...
@_date: 2013-10-21 09:17:32
12$ shipping, holly molly. Where are they coming from?
@_date: 2013-11-13 06:24:19
That's why the rich will keep rich. Very sad. I hoped that Bitcoin still shake the rich a lot. Giving the poor a chance. But so far people are paying there loans and for cars. Oh well... it's not like you could have paid them back or you would need to think about the dollar if it will get more value. It will inflate... so sad
@_date: 2013-05-29 18:44:24
no one knows... lol
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:07:23

Why? It would drive the price to where it belongs to. Why do people complain that if you buy something the price goes up and you can sell with win. What´s the problem her? 
I see all those "buy fractions of virtual Bitcoin" things coming as a problem. All they do is hide behind a shadow and wall how many people and money is in Bitcoin and keeping the price artificially low.

If you think or there is a reason to believe that your investment fails. Or you need money quick soon. But Bitcoin is like a bet you can't lose on long run. Or like betting on a new war. It is 100% sure that there will be one. But not when and where. In bitcoins it is 100% sure it will raise to a lot. Just not sure when and how much.

@_date: 2013-11-25 17:11:50
Yup 
@_date: 2013-06-08 20:23:18
So sad, that no one gives a fuck. whatsapp, facebook, SMS Dropbox etc are just too big to fail. No one will switch just because someone reads there data.
source: told 10 people about it, no on gave a fuck and even asked how to prevent it.
@_date: 2013-04-17 07:57:56
Dont listen to them, just keep them until you can buy a planet! :)
@_date: 2013-06-12 17:52:12
Oh I forgot how neutral transaction fees will be :)
@_date: 2013-06-04 11:03:59
Good luck! Sadly (luckily) Bitcoins cant be (easly) tracked :)
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:30:08
Bitcoin, you will earn more
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:13:04
What about, eh, no? Lets compare Bitcoins with Facebook. What is Facebook really worth? Users, promise, name. And now Bitcoin: Users, promise, name. Thats it. So as long people think Facebook is something worth. Dont blame Bitcoin to be "nothing" worth. Come back and teach us when Facebook is nothing worth anymore.You think it wont happen? You are fucking right, it wont happen (only if Facebook starts to ban 50% of there user base or invest billions of dollar into shit) 
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:44:45
That's what everyone here wants. Later it will cost states and borders replaced by capitalism. Million more will die and suffer. For example in Germany or Netherlands. But it is better than war and Bitcoin is just a little step into something new. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 06:28:28
As an ex organizer and player I can confirm. Always troublesome...
@_date: 2013-06-21 15:43:44
or people call you cheater even if you arent
@_date: 2013-09-06 19:09:12
Yup, by the richest and biggest firms / persons. Much like gold, a few avarage joe trade and or own it. But who is really owning gold? Maybe 1%? And still it is VERY popular and expensive. 
With Bitcoins JIT becomes a new level. Not only just in time delevery or production, also just in time payment. Which is very cool for big firms. 
@_date: 2013-09-06 16:41:12
You want to hear my opinion on Bitcoin? It will be the currency for the next 10.000 years. But who Iam?
@_date: 2013-06-27 12:18:03
And pay no taxes! FUCK EM!
@_date: 2013-12-20 08:57:02
No matter what you do, Bitcoin wins :-)
@_date: 2013-11-26 06:57:10
We all start laughing?
@_date: 2013-11-28 06:31:11
I dreamed a few nights ago about a crash to 30$, woke up and laughed, no one will sell that much Bitcoin and we humans are to greedy :-)
@_date: 2013-06-04 07:51:05
The bitcoin community isnt that big :)
@_date: 2013-12-27 14:10:24
And who paid for what? Or should we give goverments only ONE adress and forbid generating another one? (How to secure how to proof?) HOw to prevent Mr. Smith in Senate to get paid to allow smoking again in restaurant... Bitcoins make it even easier. And I think that is a good thing :)
@_date: 2013-11-28 12:51:14
How do you assume 9500? I would assume around 9000$ but my methods are diffent I guess :)
@_date: 2013-11-18 10:10:01
My advice too. Wait for  thousand dollar or more for Bitcoin. And start your own company!
@_date: 2013-11-24 20:30:41
Haha nice joke :-)
@_date: 2013-09-07 18:34:02
Well, hmm if you think Iam wrong: What about a little bet? :) 0.1 Bitcoin if Iam right. For me (or my familiy), or 0.1 Bitcoin for you (or for family) if I am wrong? 
Just point me to an escrow which we both trust with betting :)
@_date: 2013-06-04 10:43:05
Tried it with a 7770 HD, would make a loss. And I guess many would do either. Big bubble at moment :) (to many miners)
@_date: 2013-09-20 06:56:31
Gah,I want shares but my money is still not on Bitstamp :D
@_date: 2013-09-23 13:36:55
Well, Havelock is on godday so this is the next one to be closed. Bitfunder don´t work, because you can´t register on weexchange. Nice :)
@_date: 2013-08-22 04:27:01
I guess the guy who bought for 50k$ at around 100 dollaer is pretty happy right now :)
@_date: 2013-05-28 05:12:43
They wont explode, but go up to 170$ the next weeks, (just a guess, hehe) we humans try hard to resist learning :)
@_date: 2013-09-17 16:36:17
Yep, want to live with the girl you love from another country? FORGET IT!
@_date: 2013-11-25 10:41:40
No one is forced to buy them. If you don´t like it. Don´t buy it. 
My 2 cents: It is like mining hardware, no ROI many (stupid) buyers.
@_date: 2013-05-28 14:34:12
Well, its not a bubble, but it need to start somewhere, so, the rest is true, but it will help to spread the word about Bitcoins like the Porn-Industry (like it or not) drove DVD
@_date: 2013-11-18 10:18:50
But the 14 year old kids are the kids who use it as a currency. While we just hold. So it's even good. We make money they start to use it how it is ment to be.Well I would prefer some rich kids from poor people. But I guess that won't happen :'(
@_date: 2013-06-11 17:27:21
Imagine they wouldnt do that, they would have more people than CHINA!
@_date: 2013-04-13 12:00:21
second this
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:16:26
10 minutes, like the difficulty :D
@_date: 2013-05-03 18:03:17
The second bubble just popped, just wait a bit to get BTCs for cheap dollar.
@_date: 2013-09-01 16:47:39
But they won´t have any use or worth. No one will or can use them. Much like now.
@_date: 2013-12-27 20:37:42
Wasn't there a big movement a week or so ago?
@_date: 2013-12-04 13:14:58
In a few month :D
@_date: 2013-05-23 14:03:54
So, if you got a fountain in your city, you need water, you say that everyone should get free water and if someone abuses the fountain he should be allowed to stay and / slow down others? 
Yes it could be fixed, yes it should be fixed, yes there need to be some kind of pressure so it would be fixed. But spamming the blockchain with shit wont help either.
@_date: 2013-11-25 16:52:09
Until it hits 9000 every time is a good time.
@_date: 2013-07-10 08:02:06
Well how do you think "normal" people can compete vs. big ones like ASICMINER? It is like in every area of life, competetion allows only two or three big ones.
@_date: 2013-05-18 23:49:16
Don't say you still believe humans do the "right thing" based on facts, higher wealth, for a greater good, for human mankind? How old are you that you still believe that? :)
@_date: 2013-10-23 10:06:38
If people are stupid enoough to lose money on "bets" because of greed. 
I give zero fucks
@_date: 2013-11-04 10:57:55
Which will happen soon or later. This time it won´t be donations and travels, just a few Bitcoins changing hands. With the politicians seeing it´s benefit in a few seconds :)
@_date: 2013-11-29 08:31:56
It´s a typical social circle behavour. He is living his "ape famaly" for a new one. They see it and, apperently, don´t like that.
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:28:41
No, more and more people invest. Many people I know thinking Bitcoin is funny money start to consider to invest. It will be far more then to the moon. 
And I told you so. No one will stop Bitcoin. They want some piece of the pie too! :-)
@_date: 2013-07-18 10:42:31
lol, thats cool. Haha! But really, Bitcoin is all about greed (more or less) wtf did you expected? 
@_date: 2013-11-20 10:43:46
Without real name, we can talk :)
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:17:59
Not in the next months.
@_date: 2013-09-05 10:33:11
Bitcoin will fix that ;)
@_date: 2013-09-29 19:19:44
And people complain about pre mining :D
@_date: 2013-07-07 18:07:05
Yup and I think more and more people will do that. i see a bright future for Bitcoins :)
@_date: 2013-09-18 12:21:06
In the same way as the free market fixes the US or Canada internet market :)
@_date: 2013-09-24 12:26:31
The but not the domain. (Godaddy) you can do a whois on your own.
@_date: 2013-11-25 16:48:57
It is, it is favoring and build on greed. But anything else would have failed. If let's say he would increase the total amount by just one % per year in protocol it would have failed. That's how humans work. So what?
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:56:47
That's why the DM was so good. It was controlled on many fronts. State, firms, banks, bureaucracy. Now we have an Euro controlled by EZB :'(
@_date: 2013-11-30 11:59:21
Good job to the guys :)
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:38:20
Crash, yes might happen. Soon? I don't think so. Maybe in two or three month when things cool down. But but much. Until then enjoy and hold your money! Don't sell! Get rich and buy a house a Porsche and start a start-up :-)
@_date: 2013-06-04 07:46:34
Ssshhh we want to make money :)
@_date: 2013-11-21 18:52:20
Schödinger omg we gonna die!
@_date: 2013-09-21 16:44:12
404... where is it gone?
@_date: 2013-11-26 12:33:19
That would give Bitcoin an incredible burst of worth. :)
@_date: 2013-12-05 08:10:38
Not at all. to many transactions anyway.
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:29:29
wasn´t lol
@_date: 2013-04-21 17:04:57
We should "we"? Sell at 120$ buy at 100$ whats the problem?
@_date: 2013-05-24 14:17:32
No, the bigger it gets the saver it gets
@_date: 2013-10-21 16:56:54
Are you serioues? My goodness, I did´nt thought shipping soap would cost so much...
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:18:19
I always told my future wife about it. But it never was a life changer amount lol
@_date: 2013-12-09 06:08:30
To the andromeda galaxy, cause moon ain't enough ya dawg!
@_date: 2013-09-19 08:54:28
Looks like no once cares about the news. Still same dollar price. Oh well. Sad. People go buy Bitcoins :) (You get 5%! extra :D)
@_date: 2013-09-26 09:14:58
What the? 17 thousend? Jesus...
@_date: 2013-12-23 08:55:26
I hope they do. I hope they got the Bitcoin so they get a grasp of it usefulness and want to make sure they keep there worth.:-)
@_date: 2013-06-13 17:07:10
Two days ago I dreamed about that lol
@_date: 2013-11-25 12:13:19
So true, but many things are flawed and still took over the world because of the heerd / network effect. So what?
@_date: 2013-09-05 06:46:18
We should stop thinking in: Bitcoin will be worth X in dollar in X years. 
This is what I think it will be worth: One Bitcoin can buy a nice house in a nice city. :)
@_date: 2013-11-20 06:08:55
There will always be someone disagreeing with you. No matter what. Or doing the opposite. Those are just "bs I have no idea" arguments. We won :-)
@_date: 2013-07-07 16:57:38
And? What would be the problem? Miners invested in well, miners (hardware) spending 80$ per month for a HD wouldnt kill them.
@_date: 2013-07-13 09:30:18
25 Years is long term, my biggest bet is that really each coin would worth a shit load of money, driven by greed until broader adoption :)
@_date: 2013-06-20 08:21:29
Thats human nature, revolution is NEVER easy. And it gets harder and harder and harder with every year passing by, by "hard settled idiots sitting on there chairs saying to everything which is new: No". Only chace is war. But who wants to fight vs tanks, Airjets,M4s, microwaves and co? Hm? so we live with what we get and hope for the best. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 23:32:31
Lol, never underestimate greed. :-)
@_date: 2013-04-24 10:44:28
Hm that explains partly the second bubble :) Whats your bet when i will burst? My bet is around 180$ :)
@_date: 2013-10-18 13:37:51
And shows: You could rob, fuck, sell drugs, kill and still! Keep your money! 
Nothing on this world makes that possible, beside Bitcoin!
I see it as a great thing, it´s 100% self owned. 100% self controlled, 100% free and untaxed!
@_date: 2013-09-01 16:49:06
Yup, I suggest a 50% strategy, 50% in Bitcoin (as long there isn´t a bubble) and save the rest "tradional" .
@_date: 2013-09-01 16:47:56
Yup, lol thought the same :))
@_date: 2013-06-09 18:35:45
BTC is speculation driven at this moment. So it ill goup and down. So what?
@_date: 2013-11-18 10:07:37
Yup no need to spent coins or buy games. Just but coins instead of games. Double profit!
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:32:32
Could be even true, but luckily the people have no idea what I did or what I know or don't (want to believe it) I don't blame them, it's easier to think the same things then yesterday.
@_date: 2013-06-02 09:44:41
They make for sure a shit load of money, i am a bit angry lol
@_date: 2013-12-10 14:43:46
@_date: 2013-05-27 18:06:05
Skyrocketing difficulty, might be even more, its like a Gold rush, the first one get the most, the on the rest only the sellers are the winners. But, go on buy, you are helping the network. Its like a donation 
@_date: 2013-06-05 12:43:38
Huh? Because I say the price will rise? I dont get it oO
@_date: 2013-11-26 13:48:25
Guys, keep that upvoting! :)
@_date: 2013-09-19 13:50:08
Well, that's why we work with Virtual money, you can´t wait 10 Minutes on a till. And it could agreed upon that the money is "instant" (paid upfront in trust) and the actual Bitcoins arrive in 10 Minutes.
@_date: 2013-05-04 07:31:47
Make it simple: The banks just need to stop processing payments for Bitcoins, yes you can do than "local trades" but this would be the end of Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-05-30 06:52:54
Can I finally set a custom path for the wallet and chain files?
@_date: 2013-09-07 14:21:22
Well, you know what cool is about captialism? You don´t need states! First little (but horrobile, like atom bombs) step. But that´s how it is. I we go to other planets, study history what hapenned there. We will find a lot similarities (as long they aren´t a tribe culture or religion culture) 
@_date: 2013-11-29 08:51:16
He is joking
@_date: 2013-09-16 04:17:05
Instead of complaining we should say thanks, such guys are preventing right now (soon we will have it anyway) an oligopole.  But even the richest idealist will leave the game to the big players.
@_date: 2013-06-28 04:15:55
Unlike Fiat money, its "easy" (relative spoken) to creae what ever service you want for Bitcoins. If they dont get what they want. Code it for your self. Get bitcoind and start happy coding.
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:19:11
Add my disk too, Bad sectors, thrown away years back. :) Might be already destroyed. (Highly likly burned, crushed or whatever we do in Germany with tech stuff in trash lol)
@_date: 2013-11-29 08:57:14
Nothing, it's not like people stop using internet services just because there only two or three in the whole state available.
@_date: 2013-12-31 15:21:28
I pretty much bet that Sony, LG and co are also on "good hand guide" or they won´t be allowed to sell phones in US.
@_date: 2013-09-01 09:07:38
Not bad :)
@_date: 2013-09-04 18:26:22
So three month :)
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:51:42
Low, very low, some "guys" have there hands already on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-23 12:10:07
@_date: 2013-07-15 08:01:19
Yup, only make things "worse". Well ok not worse, it will switch the power from Govermants to corperations. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:09:56
I don't want to see your real wallet if you carry that much on your phone around lol
@_date: 2013-11-15 16:27:51
True far far longer than most do
@_date: 2013-10-23 07:15:48
Yep it is horshit, we will just stop to "overconsume" we will think triple: DO i need that? Or could I just keep my IPhone which is three years old to "earn" some money.
Which is even GOOD. Because this total "over consuming" and killing the earth with it is the real horseshit.
@_date: 2013-09-25 06:34:38
I don´t think so, the benefits of Bitcoin are just to big.
@_date: 2013-07-07 17:03:24
It is already happeneing (Off chain transactions) so what would be different?
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:45:09
It is, but it will be a long time everyone interested in this phase getting in and stop buying. :-) greed is good hehe
@_date: 2013-11-21 12:37:37
lmao, that makes working a lot easier!
Thanks! :)
@_date: 2013-09-26 08:06:15
To lazy to read, but is there an "upper" limit? Or (in theory) could they drive up the price to infinite?
@_date: 2013-06-22 09:16:18
yup, BTC wont help, if you would had used BTC they would run in with a few cops and close the shop anyway. And just guess how much you earned (At least they do it in Germany that way)
@_date: 2013-12-06 14:19:18
Maybe, could be to early.
@_date: 2013-04-28 10:31:20
at any point. Even in 10 years google wont accept  it until the laws say in at least of 80% of the states around the world: Yes we allow bitcoins. Google is to big to use something "fishy"
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:59:38
Yep, and it is a good thing or do you want to tell me that the ever growing demand is a good thing for earth? Or if Asia joins "Europe" standard? No way!
@_date: 2013-11-25 17:18:28
Fair? No lol better? No, but better for how humans work and how our situation is. Better than war.
@_date: 2013-11-15 18:31:37
Yeah, three Wayne's on coach shall be there name for eternity. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:29:34
Bitcoin uses greed in whole supply chain. That's why it will succeed.
@_date: 2013-04-26 06:27:27
Well, like WoW, you pay 15$ Dollars, instead of earning "amount" x o make a profit you fully the money into the game as an "economic" driver. While the rest of the game is more or less like lets say, League of legends, Heroes of Newerth or Dota 2 to sum it up: Good examples of free to play not pay to win. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 06:26:47
It's pretty sure known what will happen. But we like new toys :-)
@_date: 2013-09-07 19:09:19
Highly risky advice!
@_date: 2013-06-01 15:07:40
Not everyone is 24/7 on lol
@_date: 2013-11-18 10:21:16
I don't have any left hehe. Spent it all on future wife :-) but even I would hold then. Better and making me more money :-)
@_date: 2013-04-19 14:36:27
There is no Bubble, damn it! 
PS.: Buy guys, I want to make money :)
@_date: 2013-09-19 04:37:59
Maybe we make a new TV series: Crash is coming. 
And yeah a crash will come, thats for sure, and after the crash the richest will be even richer. So what?
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:02:52
Well, read my comment on that citadel page. Who would write that? If you get it right you get +1 intelligence :-)
@_date: 2013-11-20 13:56:11
They are like 24 hours behind real price :)
@_date: 2013-11-04 11:14:12
The four miners would probably set transaction costs to 1 Bitcoin. That is more likely to happen than anything else (Well literally, not that high but way tabove "should" be costs)
@_date: 2013-11-28 07:10:52
Yes, most countries have a free limit per year where you don't need to pay taxes. Check that out.
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:26:56
Long term,I bet, yes, oh by the way. I wanted to bet that Bitcoin will be worth a lot a few month ago and that it is no bubble. I got down voted lol
@_date: 2013-04-22 20:22:47
We all now how big "lobbies" are, and the rich "I dont want to pay taxes" guys are slowly realizing what a bless bitcoin is! Do you think those nice guys (avoiding taxes by all means and lying in your face that they love to pay taxes) wont be part of the the lobby to keep Bitcoin and allow Bitcoin i future? No, it wont stop to exist and it wont be stopped by states because the guys who make the laws are paid (big) by the guys who wants to "free trade and tax free world". Oh and dont forget all those weapon and drug lords. They have there own reasons to keep Bitcoins :)
tl;dr: Nope, Bitcoins wont go
@_date: 2013-04-20 20:22:42
Yup, difficulty will skyrocket, not linear but exponential. Oh well, poor guy. But hey, greed is good thats how I make money :)
@_date: 2013-06-28 11:47:54
Upvote because I like jolla, don´t know why lol
@_date: 2013-10-31 10:02:06
And don´t forget:
USB-Stick 
1 Kg Gold
Who wins? :)
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:01:58
It just need to "stay" and not forbidden worldwide and the price will rise. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 06:52:01
With the price of slavery in Japan, China, over crowd on this world etc. Sounds great to keep going!
@_date: 2013-08-25 06:10:40
Yes and no, but I´d rather see banks making laws instead of firms making laws. The Banks make laws which are in the interest of them but don´t prevent making money on other firms, but firms are interested only making money and no one else( No other firms) !
So if we separate banks and states, we would be left by firms only making laws. no no please not.
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:02:39
500$ on Bitstamp! Time to buy! :)
@_date: 2013-07-03 09:39:40
And thats a good sign! It will help Bitcoin to spread. I think I wrote it like 200 times. But just sayin again :)
@_date: 2013-09-20 11:45:57
New banks arise, look at cyprus :)
@_date: 2013-11-23 12:11:48
So your Bitcoin would be more worth. What would be the problem?
@_date: 2013-09-19 10:29:10
Sure, Bitcoin banks could jump in here. Allowing "zero time, zero confirmation" transmitting of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-09-03 04:21:02
I will ask in five years if Bitcoin is still funny money for you. :)
@_date: 2013-04-15 08:37:24
Uh money? Wealth? You know, some people kill for less. Even in Germany
note: My Girlfriend is from Nigeria, so Im far away from being a racist. But I know how life is there...
@_date: 2013-06-21 15:28:48
Why? Because if they start to accept Bitcoins the price of Bitcoins will rise to 110$ maybe even more.
@_date: 2013-11-14 18:39:41
So Facebook is a scam because it uses, sell and own your data? Because they make money with there investment? Ripple is not a scam or Bitcoin would be one to. Satoshi and friends own a shit load of bitcoins
@_date: 2013-09-03 13:51:32
Nope, the more worth it will get, the more greed it will awake. Result: Goldrush and bubbles and more users. 
@_date: 2013-08-19 08:51:32
Yup, maybe all those retards from frontpage put all their money in Gox and are now buying. Then I apologize for my former comment (asking why the price is still around 100$) 
And I must admit that gox is still the "to go" option for everyone out there and new in Bitcoins to buy there....
@_date: 2013-07-10 07:53:20
Yeah and more people will leave until between two or three are left. nothing surprising here.
@_date: 2013-06-07 04:58:27
Yeah, if I would start donating my money (even one dollar to all free / opensource Software) I use. I would be a poor man after 1 day ;( But bitcoin might be a chance,  just donate 20cents isnt a problem anymore. If everyone does it, or many... well.. ok I´m dreaming lol
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:52:19
I refer to it as: The last bubble to burst (Realising that money isn´t everything)
@_date: 2013-11-21 14:50:49
900 was the bubble, 700 is the aftermath. It will pop too and go down to around 600$
@_date: 2013-11-18 13:19:28
Well she is from Nigeria / Amercia, marriage, documents, papers and buerocracy alone has cost me around 1000 Euro. That´s why I want to so states die on Bitcoin. I want to live and marry whoever I like!
@_date: 2013-06-07 13:38:25
Sure we want, anyone with half a brain want Dropbox to accept Bitcoins. It would raise the price and worth of Bitcoins (visibility)
@_date: 2013-09-17 16:34:25
Lol, no revolution from me. It will be whole greed driven. No need to do anything :) I will just sit back and enjoy the show.
PS: You see what greed driven is able to change: Copyright? One click hoster paying uploaders anyone? 
@_date: 2013-03-27 11:38:28
I defently think it is a huge bubble right now. To quick, to big. Not that Im against it. RISE RISE RISE if you can my lovely Bitcoins :D 
@_date: 2013-05-19 00:26:29
Bitcons are what we make out of them, simple. A new way of communism and socialism without states over the whole world? No problem.
A new dark age of capitalism where "kings" of money rules and dictates everyones live. Where killiing a human is paid with 0.001 Bitcoin? No problem
A new age of "share-holding" where everyone gets a part of the blockchain control, everything from then will be "consens" ruled. You vote, you eat, you pay, you live and die with your key, blockchain and the control over it. 
Everything is possible. 
We just need to stop life our live like we are used to it. But well, I know and I guess everyone else who knows how humans work know where it will goes :)
@_date: 2013-11-13 18:24:59
True. There is the chance of a software problem. And the chance that we pass to quick the state borders and stop paying taxes. But the rest is pretty sure. Or someone build something based on quantum computers ten times  better. :-)

Pro tip: Android app for Bitcoin :D
@_date: 2013-09-24 04:41:14
Yup, just thought the same, or there isn´t even a single guy selling Bitcoin. (I once asked about Nigera where my GF is... well)
@_date: 2013-08-20 13:02:11
I guess Gox, he raised the price to 120 lol
@_date: 2013-09-03 09:53:38
Want to bet? In five years it is minimum double as much worth (230 dollar or more) +- 5% trading fluctuation. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:27:54
Try Nigeria....
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:59:15
yes I think it will stabilize around 170 for a long time. It will go down a while. I guess for the next two weeks. The bandwagon just started. But people are buying in now. But they arent much. So price falls. But will crawl up to stabilize around 170 until the next crash of a state bank or whatever.
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:22:03
As Apple would say: Is there a law which says: Crypto currencies must be taxed and reported if you buy something with them? No? Than don´t report.

What a bullshit lmao. For every company in existent there first and highest priority is to make (more) money. 
As soon 
image + way to pay + profit with Bitcoin &gt; Paypal 
they will switch. (While first they just will consider image and a "slight" profit" )
Simple

@_date: 2013-12-29 17:07:13
If Amazon accept it, it would be more like. Pay with Bitcoin, get 1 Bitcoin worth 700 dollar. At evening worth 900 dollar. You know that Bitcoin is a pyramid scheme? Anyone not jumping in is just stupid. 
@_date: 2013-09-30 12:21:59
BUY! You help the whole network! Don´t give the network into the hands of just two or three mining firms!
@_date: 2013-08-31 18:09:16
It´s a lot of fun :) And sadly true, that´s why I tell "poor" people to buy as soon as possible, it´s a call of chance to divide money. I wrote about it. But I got stomped -_- 
Nonetheless it is just a scenario. Time is a funny thing. It does not went straight. There is a 0.01% chance things will change (determenistic universe hehe) IF he is from future :)
@_date: 2013-07-06 22:17:24
Well, Bitcoin is to volatile that it rises and drops a few dollars. So you don't need to look for "real" top and bottom. Making everytime one dollar makes you on a day with just one Bitcoin 10$ with ease.
@_date: 2013-06-09 08:15:19
I´m pretty sure Ripple will surpass Bitcoin someday. Not in 1,2,3,4,5 Years. But I think in 10-15 years. When people start to forget all the scam, pre mined stuff things...

It's still not a bubble as it seems, greed is kicking in and more and more people are joining the boat.
@_date: 2013-11-12 13:49:11
Confident, yes, they are right.Bitcoin is amazing and another tool to let money flow to just a few people. It's just a next step. I'm not worried at all. And I don't understand  why people think greed is bad. It it's greed which drove and will drive Bitcoin development. From mining to hoarding to tax free spending and payment over seas without government interference. So what? 
@_date: 2013-04-27 13:39:11
no shit? Driven by speculators? How surprising! Not that this is worldwide the case at this moment.
@_date: 2013-12-06 06:38:44

@_date: 2013-06-27 07:40:27
Its a logical move, if you think about: around 15% or even more are refund, fraud and other problems. A big firm has no problem with such things. But if you are small 15% is a lot.

Well, drug dealer are (almost) everywhere "richer" than the crowd. Nothing changed.
@_date: 2013-11-20 11:32:00
The market needs an "api" provider. You do the software and traind etc. While others have the frontend and the regulations etc. 
I think that is missing. So we can setup easily around the world for easy and cheap "exchange" setup.
@_date: 2013-12-17 06:18:43
As said, on paper you pay more taxes and for healthcare etc . But the reality is they pay less than normal people after a certain amount.

the EUR market is on Bitstamp. No need for an alternative. Per Country makes sense, per region makes sense, but not two or three exchanges per region /country (Which is happening right now) the reulst is: No one goes to kraken.

Some of my co workers bought mining power. Hehe. Because right now I think its the last chance for "poor man to mine". Next step/ month will be impossible.
And some will just buy. 
Another one will dump some saving into after they understood how importan Bitcoin will be to allow tax evasion, lundering and for the "rich people" (If launder money or they, it wont be much, even joke, but for the big guys its very usefulll. So keep rising the price) and other greed driven things. SWIFT is a good example too, how Bitcoin supports it´s own spreading by allowing to save, taxes, transaction costs and avoiding "questions" and state regulations. :)

Why? QQ normal business, if you are not good enough, learn more, get better earn more money. If you are still not good enough it is in everyones interest that you live. If you still "clue your ass to the chair" and let the whole firm fall because of your big ass ego... well.. That's just retarded.

I will just repeat myself: People want Ripple. End of story, scam or not.
The price of Bitcoin is rising with this news... So? You want to tell me it's a bad news? Just because some guys with a quick down vote button don't want to accept it doesn't mean it has no real world value or is "bad". Guys, wake up,  not the honest guys win. Never. (almost)

Don´t worry just a "communism" backward country. Western civilizations where everything all about is money. Won´t ban Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-07-01 14:12:26
Its a good sign, it means that Bitcoins are important and taken serous! You wont scam people if you think its useless or nothing worth. 
@_date: 2013-09-17 16:12:39
There won´t be anarchy. Never ever. We human tend to "follow" a leader and trying to be a leader.

you think? Really? If the next (big) batch of mined Bitcoins are sold with 10% higher prices, because 80% of the bitcoins were mined with expensive hardware. Do you think the "rest" wont sell there coins for more? lol
@_date: 2013-06-10 04:23:16
I bought @ 7$ :)
@_date: 2013-04-15 08:24:41

Is there a bet service? On next difficulty? Or we can do it just for the lulz, I bet it will go up by around 40%, next wont go up, maybe even down. Why? In next raise it will be very hard to mine with GPU (But I bet all the Kids out there still do it) but on the next raise they will give up. Thatas why I think it will normalize.
@_date: 2013-12-10 13:49:18

You know, Bitcoin saves the world from corporation greed lmao :)
@_date: 2013-11-21 13:46:35
Yep, and sellers choose what buyers will accept. If you see everywhere Bitcoin tags. The buyers will switch from Paypall to Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-05-15 19:03:03
No need to form lobbies, the rich will do it for us so they can buy and use bitcoins to avoid taxes.

@_date: 2013-11-20 18:35:19
And why should I buy a car at all if my bitcoins will be more worth every month? Or year? You see the point? It will let me think twice or three times before I buy something. Driven by need. Not desire. That is a good thing.
@_date: 2013-05-31 09:29:22
We develop faster than we should anyway. So if 50% of humans die because of slower progress it wont be that bad (For us, for the world etc.)

Dont worry, we built and have a semi monopole with Bitcoin. On the Dotcom Bubble other things were more interesting as an investment (Gold, Silver whatever) But with Bitcoins, well Litecoins maybe or Namecoins and thats it. This is fucking genius. Isnt it? :)

well you know bitcoiners want more Bitcoiners (to buy) so there Bitcoins are more worth? Its a little bit like a Pyramide :)
@_date: 2013-05-28 12:46:12
But you cant do thousands of transactions per second. You see the problem? So
a) New and more people need to do transactions (who can you trust?)
b) The server are placed in shady Ghana
c) Anyone and the speculators stops to trade Bitcoins (Amazing price drop)

It's not stolen enough money, lmao
@_date: 2013-07-02 16:24:49
But with post stamps you got a scale "price" while with Ripples you get an "increasing price" (per unit transferred) The only thing compared to this in real life is gold. Not post stamps. With post stamps you can´t travel around and buy Bitcoins, USD, Euros, Litecoins etc. But you can do this with Ripples. That's a much more useful and valuable than Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-05-14 04:43:26

I can´t predict the future 100% accurate. But based on human behavior, experience and probability calculations I can predict "events pretty good". I don't know why, it´s just like that.Sure I use a "system" and  I was anyway thinking about to do an AMA or explain it. 
So make it simple now: I have three and a half axes in my head. 
Human behavior, chance of something happening, prediction from past events to future and reality probability (chance of something happening in reallity) 
Well and there was one news where I knew: thats it, game over. Bitcoin won. Small event, huge impact. 
To Bill Gates: It was just an example of a person with a shit load of money, you could also place lord xxx or prince alu abdul alla muhad. Whatever, the meaning stays.

I am already dreaming of that! When finally all those scumbbacks and idiots which can´t or won't work die on the street. EVEN in Swiss or Germany or Britain oh my, what a wonderful day. It is just a little step to end Government control, social control and then, a million years later the "so called" money system. Bitcoin will be forever in the human history for a little step forward to realize how idiotic money is. 
PS. : I save a few Bitcoins for my kids, before money cease to exist they need a good start :)

@_date: 2013-10-29 10:07:44
Sure I would call Bitcoin a snowball. Because the more people adopt, the more and faster it moves (and more expensive it will be) it is like a genius devils circle. Perfect made for human desire and greed and later complete lock-in :)
I tip my hat for Satoshi to accomplish that
@_date: 2013-07-01 13:43:38

Well, depends on the user count. But I guess you will get a lot of users. (Later down the street hehe) if you stick to 0.5% on EVERY transaction you will earn a lot. Thousend transactions each 100$ (Thats not much)..
And people will question it: Why not use QT for free or a web wallet? Or whatever. Better say something like: The smallest possible transfer fee is taken as payment. 
Because of the added "bonus" stuff you can do as a local client.

And with it the price will go up too. Pretty cool to see :) Some people said the price won´t go up if the price "per bitcoin to mine" goes up. But we are getting slowly a monopole. So why shouldnt they "charge more"? :)
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:29:28
Won't happen, everyone or enough of the people who ad-free making the laws have there hands knee deep in Bitcoin. Already so no need to worry I that side. In China will happen the same as in America.

Hmm interesting idea, let´s think about it.
Scenario: You are rich like a king. You don´t care about the rest of the world. You can agree to mine more Bitcoin. But there two others which need to agree. Hmm yes i think it would be possible. You just hoard the more Bitcoin to get even richer. 
So your point is? :)
@_date: 2013-07-12 18:45:57
Nah if Gox crashes to the point "Nothing to get back status", neither Bitcoins nor dollars, Bitcoins would be dead. They hold a fucking huge amount of both. This would be the end of Bitcoins.

Oh, I am far from pro capitalist. Just someone which supports pro capitalist movements. Why? Because we need a pure capitalist world. To live within it. We need to "survive" such a world, to  make that experience how bad such a world is (And we are making good moves to such a world) So we can have a better future :) In my opionen Bitcoins (or something like that) will be the last currency on earth. Were each Bitcoin will be worth like Millions of Dollar. And than, I hope, the last bubble will burst: You dont need money to work. Oh well just dreaming lol
@_date: 2013-08-19 06:51:58
Hm still Bitcoins float around the same value. What does it tell you? Even the tech savvy people from reddit avoid Bitcoins... Or the price was artificially held up. I favor the second option.

Bitcoin will slow it down, to a point where more and more people almost stop buying. So minus economic grow. That will help us to recover and heal the wounds. Sure, a lot of people will suffer. Way more than now. But less than war. Which would be the alternative. I think Bitcoin in genius.

I told that all my friends, since over one year. They all told me: The state will stop Bitcoin. I loled And told them: Who makes the lwas? RIGHT: The same guys right now and in future making money from Bitcoin and its boom. Who in the world would propose a law to stop that?
So far Bitcoin are floating around 170$ and getting bigger everyday. They still think Bitcoin is funny money. Well, I will keep my shareholdings and "funny" money to buy a little Aparment later on and buy a good eduction for my kids. While they live on the street. Poor sheeps :)

Are you guys that fucking stupid what he will have replied? 
He would replied like anyone wanting to protect there investments: Nope, nothing to worry about it is just a trading good.. or something like that along the lines. 
And that, guys, is what I tell you the whole time. Bitcoins won´t get banned, thanks to replies and information or the guys making the laws to not kill Bitcoin. To make money with it.

@_date: 2013-07-21 15:04:18

Hmmm, Switzerland is in an interesting position.
For decades they lived from money laundering and tax evasion. (Ok a bit overestimated, but for  sure they profit from it A LOT) 
So by allowing Bitcoin they could be the spearhead of the world wide accepting and usage of Bitcoin. But on the other side. They can´t openly accept them now (An image would lose big times) So I thought: They try to prevent a final decision as late as possible.

You can, if the patent guys allow it. If not, you just wasted money.

On one side, I think it will be a huge success. Because people want "easy to and secure ways" to store their money. Since, well. I don´t know when. No matter which kind of money. 
But Bitcoin is so "easy" to store. That it might be really not important anymore to store somewhere else. And don´t forget Bitcoin is greed driven (My treasssssure Bitcoin  :) ) 
So it´s risky as fuck, but if it works out, we will have a global giant huge bank player for Bitcoin. I will invest around 10$ for the lulz and see what will happen :)

I´m an asshole hoping that thousands of Bitcoin are lost and mine are more worthe? :D
@_date: 2013-07-03 18:17:06
Not anymore, throw my HD away with a lot of them on it. Didn´t thought they will get any worth -_- But, well, yeah I guess I would had tanked Bitcoins already, so maybe it is better lmao
@_date: 2013-07-24 11:43:06
Oh cool, just pay via Bitcoin: Than I will be happy to transfer your money to the bank account of your choice. :D
@_date: 2013-10-23 07:38:55
Why? I will top out at even WAY more. 
@_date: 2013-09-06 06:05:52
Well, not really pump, more like: THE SKY IS THE LIMIT!
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:49:53
ahhh that explains the price drop. LoL feels good to have a semi monopole which controls the price, right guys?
Edit: Cant believe that the price still depends on gox only. Retard lvl 9000
@_date: 2013-07-02 13:20:37
Yep, ripple is far better than Bitcoin in the long term. Ripples will be the Gold for Bitcoins and Litecoins, Euros, Dollars  and all the other currencies..
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:38:09
That´s the point of Bitcoin, to not pay taxes :)
@_date: 2013-08-26 04:13:44
Shhhh we want to believe!
@_date: 2013-05-09 12:38:08
NOt now, but after Dropbox tarts to accept Bitcoins :)
@_date: 2013-11-04 08:00:38
Yeah, I think the same could happen to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-01 08:07:59
Sshhhh stop talking :-)
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:40:17
And see how much people like tax evasion and making money :-) silk closed: price rises, you need to pay taxes and report income? Price falls lol
@_date: 2013-11-21 06:53:36
Btc only? Picture of Amazon? Lol
@_date: 2013-09-30 11:39:40
German here, I know a dozen Germans who whish to create private militias and own guns for self defense (The world is getting rougher, you can´t deny that) 
Sure, guns aren´t the right way to fix problems which were created ten years ago (education, payment, jobless etc) but they are easy to use, cheap and you feel good when you own a magnum :)

We must construct additional nodes.

@_date: 2013-11-29 15:16:39
I don't think it is over valued, it is just a start. The problem is the spread. To less people holding Bitcoin. The correction will happen because people realise no one is using it. 
Not only because of hoarding, but also because only like ten people of thousands have Bitcoin. Not really a target group for now. We really need a correction so more people can get in. Or try to get in. 
Or the richest start to hand them out for free to co workers, friends and family that would help to. But that won't happen hehe. 
@_date: 2013-05-24 22:27:54
Who cares about evil? If SOE accepts Bitcoins they will be more worth :D
@_date: 2013-09-25 08:34:41
And that is why more traders will switch to Bitcoin. It is an excellent seller protection. The only reason paypal can pull off the stunts they are doin (Charge back because I don´t like the sellers nose) is only possible because they got a monopole. How long can they stand until the seller run away? Who knows?
@_date: 2013-10-26 07:06:03
oh yah, good idea :)
@_date: 2013-09-04 19:39:42
lol no, greed will turn it to 90% :)
@_date: 2013-11-25 11:37:44
And I go in war with my USB stick, to someone with also an USB stick? SMART MOVE! (Who also doesn´t have power.) 
Sometimes I am really amazed how human came so far, lol
@_date: 2013-04-14 08:32:09
Scenario: Someone hears about Bitcoin. goes to gox, lags like shit there. Do you think he will comeback? No he wont. The traction s partly lost than and so the price drops.
@_date: 2013-10-29 10:09:01
Hm they rejected mine as digital documents. ROFL! (WTF do you expect nowadays as bills? )...
@_date: 2013-09-20 04:33:20
No, the confirmation time is here the problem. Not the subbmitting time
@_date: 2013-11-20 06:47:31
I would also like to mention that Bitcoin is just the next step from phone to internet to Bitcoin. Jobs, firms and regulations are invalid arguments. Phone killed millions of jobs. Internet did. And Bitcoin will do that to. You can't say yes to internet and no to Bitcoin just because it's easy to say no.
@_date: 2013-07-18 17:30:30
Oh, just for your Information, I´m not "trying" to prevent Bitcoin, I LOVE Bitcoin! Bitcoin will be / is the fuel for a fire for million of years. And it will increase the size and speed of the fire. 
@_date: 2013-09-04 19:20:16
And the difficulty won´t go up?
@_date: 2013-06-01 21:04:53
If you expect a full scale war you should maybe invest in weapons and not Bitcoins? Because in such a big war, Bitcoins will go worhtless.
@_date: 2013-07-11 14:57:49
I think its pretty cool that thousends of greedy people spent alot of money to increase the overall security of Bitcoins. thank you all the guys donating around 200$ - 2000$! Well ok, mostly they donate to Avalon and co. but we can say they donate 30-40% of it to Bitcoin thx :)
@_date: 2013-11-21 06:34:09
We are more liberal and social than America and still have an amazing economy. Some would call us communists when they would know how many social laws we have. But it works so far. Something to Bitcoin. I think hehe 
@_date: 2013-09-21 18:57:44
The problem is that the "world" couldn´t agree on a paperless, easy to use with RFID, NFC or whatever system for payment. Or they went full tard and greedy. On worldwide system. Where everywhere and everythings works with one standard. Guess what? It gets cheaper and cheaper to get hardware for it. (Both for costumers and traders)
@_date: 2013-09-04 10:16:41
Well thats the plan :)
@_date: 2013-12-02 10:44:01
I´m really, sad hoped for a bigger crash :/
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:32:02
lol no, greed. 
@_date: 2013-09-25 08:26:36
And? So what? 
I can have many things when the seller don´t support them. (As now like Bitcoin) but the greed (none refundable) will drive the adaption of Bitcoin to more and more sellers to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-10-17 13:49:30
We don´t need roads, firms will build them if they need them. Or you pay for it. How it should be
@_date: 2013-09-19 18:17:27


You are right, I m sorry thats not much.
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:49:57
I'm not so quite sure for a drop.
@_date: 2013-06-04 10:50:04
Like, never I would guess. I would cancel the order and wait for the next big fish (Something with 5th/s or so.)
@_date: 2013-09-27 04:53:28
Yup, I think that to, for quit a while now. The race is over. Bitcoin won and it is just now a matter of time (Ok very, very, very, very. And many more very. rare chance exist that the 20 biggest states will ban Bitcoin over night, but that unlikeley, the guys making money with Bitcoin are also making laws. Isn´t that great? :) )
@_date: 2013-09-19 10:27:02
Not that is same with shareholdings if you bought early and the price goes op of the firm.... 
But we should all agree that Bitcoin is greed driven development. Which is the fastest and best way to spread and develop something.
@_date: 2013-05-31 14:56:23
You know that it was planned as "making" money to so people invest time and money to mine? At end it doesnt matter how many people mine, as long it is more than 2.
@_date: 2013-09-13 04:30:48


Sadly no :) 1000km off hehe
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:31:46
You forgot all the rest, transferring money from point a to point b within minutes without interruption. No state, no law, no tax. nothing. And guess who like stuff like that? Not average Joe..

@_date: 2013-09-01 09:06:43
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:37:07
Yup lol
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:27:23
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:29:53
Yep, I know, nothing new. Saw already the pattern in the blockchain moving. If a large (around 3K Bitcoins) is split into other accounts which spread farther. (fast) it is a sign of trade manipulation. Usally you keep your leave ( in term of blockchain) at least some people. But if you split up this chunk and everyone is selling. No, just no. My theory: some of the early adopters try to cooldown the market. For the reason I gave and got down voted to oblivion :) It is still not ready for prime market. 
If you believe in good people rofl.
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:18:26
That's what I read a few weeks ago to lol I guess it's more hope than truth lmao
@_date: 2013-08-25 15:28:34
Yeah, damn and I can´t code lol
@_date: 2013-11-11 06:04:41
Yup, no bubble now. Just more and more people joining and greed kicking in :)
@_date: 2013-04-20 07:32:42
Yup, and you k now what? I dont care, I know this will happen. There will be only two possible futures (in the next 40-60 years) Either fucking rich people will rule the world with Bitcoins. Or fucking rich mega cons will rule the world with fucking rich people on top. For me it doesn't matter. Bitcoins gives my child's at least a good live. So I prefer the greed and Bitcoin future :)
@_date: 2013-11-26 12:39:47
What about an Android map app based on Openstreet map data with Points where Bitcoins are accepted?
@_date: 2013-04-14 08:52:58
My guess is around 20 to 25% are already lost forever. 
@_date: 2013-09-18 04:50:23
King Alexander of Netherland just announced the end of classical welfare state. Any many states will step by step follow. People are to greedy for welfare states. You can´t keep them up. Soon or later "your fucking roads" will cost money. Like it or not.
Either because the people are to greedy: Not paying taxes (hello Bitcoin) or by greedy politicans selling the roads (already discussed and partly done) So your point is? What do you want to tell what would change??? I tell you: NOTHING FUCKING NOTHING would change. It will be just offical.
@_date: 2013-09-30 12:44:50
Yup, go to the smallest mining pool
@_date: 2013-09-04 11:12:27
And will keep happening, no matter if anarchy, democracy or pure capitalism with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-05-18 11:08:06


Haha thank you for this good morning laugh :)
Well and about the 1% problem, its the same with the dollar or everywhere else, Money is mathematical like Gravity, we dont have anti-matter (or what else is responsible in the universe that it dont collapse) so money will always flows to "rich" attracting points. I dont see a problem with it, cause thats how the world works.
@_date: 2013-05-30 18:50:50
Yeah just host your site in Ghana :D
@_date: 2013-06-07 04:55:52
That might be another good reason for Bitcoins, if you scam or cheat, nothing will protect you from guys stealing there things back :D
@_date: 2013-11-28 06:22:47
Sounds legitimate! It has btc in name!

They don´t need to be valid...

And he didn't invest a lot of time, thinking and programming into Bitcoin? That's why I don't have a problem if he will be able to buy the mars in a ten years because he is rich as fuck. He risked a lot. He won a planet. Ripple did or does the same. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:10:22
That's the point of our system right now. Profit lays in increasing cost for products on same income. I like the declining economy with Bitcoin better than that.
@_date: 2013-04-17 21:35:05
Will it protect/ help poor? In ten years? Sure, in fifrty years? Maybe, in 100 years: Nope, the poor will be so poor, without medicine, without a state, without a social net, we will have pure capitalism based on Bitcoins (At least I hope)  why pay taxes if you can just use Bitcoins? 
@_date: 2013-07-14 09:46:59
Guys, get it, as long the NSA and FBI have "full access" to your physical network (aka. Backdoor's) the level of encryption does not matter... 5 Bit, 100, 1000... Every level which takes longer than 1 day to decrypt is good enough.
@_date: 2013-12-09 09:53:14


@_date: 2013-11-28 06:35:25
Even they will die soon or later. Makes no economic sense to invest with bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:52:31
no 20 Dollars maybe. I wrote it will go down for a few weeks :)
@_date: 2013-08-18 07:06:14
WTF 2 BTC.... never... getting an USB stickt for the lulz would be cool. But I wouldn´t pay more 40 Euro or so for a decorating item...
@_date: 2013-06-05 09:57:34
What a piece of "shiet" Apple paid 0.06% of taxes. Did they spent it? No, did they use it? No, do they hoard? Does it hurt the econimics? Apperantly no one cares cause it do not hurt if hoard. (And don´t pay taxes)
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:38:47
No, it will take few days before the network changes difficulty. Thats why are more coins produced than it should be.
@_date: 2013-08-09 14:30:07
Still way to much... I guess we will end with one maybe two exchanges per state. Later on exchanges will unite together and go shareholding.
Just my 2 cents
@_date: 2013-02-21 07:37:25
I bought my BTC at around 7 Dollar, I am still amazed that price still goes up. And to say the truth, I dont know why it goes up lol. But ok, so far so good. Four times the price is good. :)
@_date: 2013-05-15 11:39:06
Hey, I am all for Bitcoins, I will give them my kids hoping that they can buy a whole planet :)
@_date: 2013-10-24 13:24:38
Even more true to Bitcoin than any other "fiat" money.
@_date: 2013-04-17 06:09:16
5 Bitcons? Respect :)
@_date: 2013-07-04 12:56:16
WOW! NICE!
@_date: 2013-08-28 16:26:32
Looks like people still don´t get how the market explodes.
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:24:30
The scary thing is it could be true. The other scary thing is I could be responsible for it. The other scary thing is I might own the formula for it. There. Here you read it first. 
The good thing is I can get it off my chest and no one believes it :-)
@_date: 2013-11-14 18:37:01
But you could start mining and out mine others. 
In theory

Edit: Wrong context lol
@_date: 2013-04-22 14:46:55
@_date: 2013-09-05 06:44:24
Because Bitcoin will replace Gold and money. On long term, it has everything it needs:Fast, cheap, "private" and increasing value to awake greed. What do you want more?
@_date: 2013-12-27 13:31:20
Most of it mined from the developers before I'm even able to download the software, configure and set up the miner. Yeah not pre mined but fast enough to give any one else no chance lol
@_date: 2013-11-26 06:55:46
Well, greed it's all part of the plan :-)
@_date: 2013-05-31 13:09:05
No, and yes, there will be only a few left. Like hm two maybe five. Nothing new. I dont see a problem with that. Its normal development.
@_date: 2013-09-06 13:06:25

oh lol, its to early here. Im sorry

I can sell and buy perfeclty on other exchanges :D
@_date: 2013-10-25 11:21:12
Hehe, let´s say, way back, when I was young. I throw away a HD, thinking, well nothing actually. Didnt thought about the Bbitcoins on it. The HD crashed (Partly). 
Let´s say when you would ask my friends about the event they would make a very sad face lol.
@_date: 2013-08-31 20:04:55
Ok, may I burst the time travel bubble? I´m the inventor of the forumala. And no, no one would travel back, go to reddit, and write about future. I would shit in your head and tear your body apart for doing stuff like this. 
But still can you take me back (future lol) just for the lulz :)
@_date: 2013-04-26 06:29:49
Bitcoin is the answer to every problem on this planet!
Well, except one: Greed :)
@_date: 2013-04-10 12:18:39
And after stabillizing it will fall. Not much, my bet is around 170-190. Than in month it will fall slowly. Until the next "big disaster in the EU or US or somewhere else". 
@_date: 2013-11-25 17:32:24
Limit supply, no growth at all. The difficulty was perfect. Start easy get harder. While later only the biggest make money. Half the Bitcoin creation. By starting big and slowing down gives the early adaptors an incredible advantage and incentive to get others later on board etc..
@_date: 2013-09-29 11:29:14
In ten years there won´t be a need for taxation anymore :)
@_date: 2013-06-02 11:12:07
LOL?! Must be a joke...
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:30:33
This time the bubble will last way way longer.
@_date: 2013-04-14 11:29:45
nope, not with that prices. How do you think you can compete with 0,5 transaction fees exchanges plus 199$.. no way. But I guess many peopl will have there Dollar signs in there eyes. Start my own exchange? No problem I will get rich... lol
@_date: 2013-11-26 16:11:38
Sure people will keep buying stuff. But people will buy less and less stuff. But why the hell do people think it's bad? It will be need driven economy, not desire nor debt. People will think about it when they see an ad, do I really need a coffee ? And that's good, period
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:02:36
om nom nom nom, lol
@_date: 2013-03-29 04:57:39
Just ignore them, really just ignore them. You cant change there mind. And if people decide to follow someone like him (Like Hitler) than you cant do anything either... this would involve deep psychological  analyses and mind manipulation. So, yeah, just ignore them.
@_date: 2013-04-11 05:27:37
Thats true! But on the other side: I got three kids to fed and a wife which has cancer. We need to a maid donate blabla thingies could explode and make scams even easier. The sad truth is: People should know that but still... I dont think they will ever learn it... lol

Even if just 0.1% of the frontpage readers have bought Bitcoins, what do you think would happen to the Bitcoins price? It would go way over 100$. But it is keeping the price, so the next logical assumption is: some people kept the price high. What, as I already wrote, I told you one or two? Month back. oh well :)
funny side note: My spelling correction makes bikinis out of Bitcoins :)
@_date: 2013-07-05 23:41:33
That not, but the high up and down to make money with end :)
@_date: 2013-06-12 16:06:09
And to keep up you need to upgrade hardware every few month. No need on a share.

@_date: 2013-04-18 17:14:40
oh wow! Why didnt I think about swiss? Man, swiss is perfect! Never pay taxes again! As soon as Bitcoins are widespread in Swiss we will have a huge rush of Bitcoin users here :) Go GO! Swiss shops! Accepts Bitcons!

No real value on ripple tbh, but Ripple is what people want, not need. There is a BIG difference. Think about Apple vs. Windows phone vs. Android.
@_date: 2013-12-30 14:42:55
I would guess Bitcoin, we won´t get rid of it as soon :)
@_date: 2013-11-28 06:58:19
All hail Bitcoin :-)
@_date: 2013-06-07 11:17:29
Oh another (Only on Apple hardware) running mobile payment solution. That will work out good.... yeah... cause... its APPLE!!!!
@_date: 2013-11-28 07:12:56
Well, that not. But slow down the economics and decrease the growth to minus.
@_date: 2013-07-27 15:23:33
No! Read again!! I'm promoting the wide spread the more different people invest the better!
@_date: 2013-07-30 06:49:14
Quit possible if you are an early adaptor with millions of Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-07-01 17:42:02
I gonne be rich
When the Chinese buy all the coins :D
@_date: 2013-10-23 08:14:28
Just started if you are interested ;)
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:44:41
That's why governments will be replaced or vanish hehe. And that is a good thing and learning experience. :-)
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:52:49
Asked localbitcoins why 1 Bitcoin. No one gives a fuck. Small people are out now I guess :-)
@_date: 2013-04-20 20:09:52
Yes, many more,  but as normal life will go on, there will be only three to five big. Which will control around 99.99999999% 
@_date: 2013-09-20 20:56:40
That explaines the price drop...:)
@_date: 2013-11-23 22:08:28
It's easy if the bitcoins are transferred go an internal wallet if the bank. And transferred bank yit.
@_date: 2013-09-05 09:39:51
EVERYONE STOP HASHING FOR TWO WEEKS! I want more money :D
@_date: 2013-11-13 06:01:09
Advised, but if you can why not? Apple does the same.
@_date: 2013-04-18 15:15:02
So Bitcoin is a scam too? They need to pay bills for years, it will take off, well or not. And it will take years to grow. So in 3-4 Years even if it takes off, they maybe have only 30% left or even less. Then they make money like anyone else with a genius idea and impact. So? Who cares?
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:14:29
Before Bitcoin I slept like four or less hours because of job, work and school. For several years, I can tell you from first hand how damaging that is..
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:38:45
Yeah, like two or three hours -_-
@_date: 2013-11-15 06:39:04
And than the government said: accept or drugs lol. But I don't think it will happen. No need to worry.

Yes that will happen, even stocks in Bitcoin will crash soon or later. Why? Well let's say you paid one coin. Firm is selling stuff for 0.5 coins and a dividend of 0.1 . Later they sell stuff for 0.2 because of increased value if Bitcoin. Firm is still worth the same. But you have bought a share with one Bitcoin. Worth it? Go figure. There is no other way than the death of stocks in Bitcoin. Which is cool. We have many social and economic problems because of stocks trying to double grow every year.

You don't take loans. Or better you shouldn't. But many will fall for it. But that's how it is.
