If Trump really believed that cryptocurrency was primarily for illegal purposes, then Stormy Daniels would have been paid in Bitcoin.
edit: Also - who wrote this for him?  it is way too coherent and remains on point.

I believe the loophole is that they cannot charge interest to other members of their faith.  
**Exodus 22:25:** If you lend money to **my** people, to the poor among you, you shall not deal with them as a creditor; you shall not exact interest from them.

Does this mean that bitcoin is taxed at 60/40 (long/short term) instead of capital gain tax? (40/15)

I just want it to hold at this level or lower until next pay day so I can buy more!
.. and then it will drop down again..  :(

I had a sell limit order at 9000 last Friday and it blew past that when i was busy.  I just put in another $100 but am mentally chafing at putting my fiat back in because I will lose all the gains I made in the past few weeks.     
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:12:48
No.   Sell so I can buy back in after it blew past my 9000 sell order and have not been able to get back in without losing all my gains.  :)

Do not sell unless it is at a higher price than you originally paid for it.  Otherwise you are losing money. 
Bitcoin, much like the stock market, is a tool that takes money from the impatient and gives it to the patient.

I put in new money but am hanging on to my gdax USD. I had a limit sell order at 9000 last weekend and it blew past that.  I am waiting to see if it dips to buy back in because I dont want to lose my gains. 
Edit:  I am hoping it drops after 10k so I can buy back in and ride it back up as new investors come on board as part of the publicity.

I had an order set for 8600 before I went to bed.  If I had caught the rise I was going to raise it but missed it.  Now i have to wait for it to drop down there to buy back in again.  Sigh.

I don't mind paying higher taxes as long as they are really being used to make life better for everyone.
