so this is how it works , you are offering a service and person B wants to buy it : they say ill buy it for 2000BLK , you say okay but lets each have 1500BLK as a deposit , you all agree and sign the contract, now all the money is put into escrow (1500 +1500 +2000), once person B acknowledges that you have completed the job you then get the 2000 he paid and your 1500 deposite back, person B also gets his 1500 deposit back, no one wants the contract to go downhill because then the deposit will be lost in escrow and everyone loses, the application are far reaching and you can trade say blackcoin and dogecoin for litecoin or with wire transfers(fiat)/money orders...ect

thats a straight up a lie, i have posted negative posts about GAW on hashtalk, you just have to have a well thought out point, back up your assumptions with evidence you have and a normal conversation like an adult human and you won't get banned/downvoted/anything bad. Yes it is a private forum and they choose to police it so that the quality of conversation is not a bunch of flame wars. your opinion is that you dislike it, thats ok. does it make most of the conversation tent be about the positive sides of GAW, yes , thats ok as well. 
Be happy friend :)

when the full client is released (i.e. not beta) you will be able to have both BTC and BLK  in the client , BLK was chosen primarily because it is a lot faster than BTC for contracts
