Buy bitcoin only to see bitcoin fall to 200. Buttfucked 2x.
@_date: 2014-02-24 07:43:01
this whole gox drama reminds me of this 
@_date: 2014-03-05 08:23:10
wow that was depressing. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 02:00:02
guilty as well. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 08:58:32
nothing is ever bad news.
@_date: 2014-02-24 03:39:52
of course it is.
@_date: 2014-03-05 03:31:17
or maybe the ones doing all the laughing didn't lose much?
@_date: 2014-02-22 13:33:16
there is not such thing as "bad news" in r/bitcoin, only good.
@_date: 2014-03-04 10:25:04
ok ill come tomorrow!
@_date: 2014-02-26 23:50:16
so how much did he lose at gox?
@_date: 2014-02-21 02:11:25
Where did you bury them? 
@_date: 2014-02-26 10:33:32
what makes you think they want back in after losing so much?
@_date: 2014-02-26 14:11:07
make sure you buy high sell low!
@_date: 2014-03-02 13:34:23
Yes please!
@_date: 2014-03-25 08:15:18
Seems like you're trolling yourself.
@_date: 2014-01-05 15:46:04
and now back down again....we're gonna be here all day if we do this.
@_date: 2015-01-13 03:33:12
If everyone got it right , no one would be making or losing money.. something has to give.
@_date: 2014-01-06 00:33:56
That's it Buy High sell Low!
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:30:55
i've said 200-300 for over 2 weeks now however the recent china development might bring it even lower.
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:57:20
they're already awake.
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:20:35
fools i tell you. i'm waiting for it to drop to 100-200 before i buy. anything above that is pure bubble that resembles an elaborate ponzi scheme . 
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:34:09
how so?  as far as i can tell all the movement is coming from BTCChina in response to the recent developments. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:56:21
@_date: 2013-12-21 09:16:37
2000 only? would have thought there would be a lot more.
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:35:11
if that's all bitcoin is to you, then i hope for its sake that you're not the majority, otherwise I'm inclined to believe some of the sceptics who claim its noting more than a elaborate ponzi scheme . 
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:31:02
higher is better right?!
@_date: 2013-12-26 09:51:16
i'm worried about small changes/manipulations that can go unnoticed, is that something possible?
@_date: 2013-12-18 09:20:37
grow up.
@_date: 2013-12-09 06:38:05
not sure the dealer feels the same. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:27:45
easy for people who already have bitcoins to say 
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:04:47
grow up.
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:24:39
how is it good news when one of bitcoins objective is to be a legal "currency" 
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:40:43
I'm from Australia but currently overseas who is also finding it almost impossible to buy using my visa or bank. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 01:44:55
how much have you lost OP?
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:41:11
why are posts like this downvoted? its truly anyone's guess where its heading because there is no way to value bitcoin, it's just pure speculation. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:18:23
bitcoin's value is primarily based on speculation, it's anyone guess where its heading but my guess is, 100-200.
@_date: 2013-12-07 12:04:58
its at 800 and climbing.
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:28:10
you're thinking too much.. all you have to know is, TO DA MOON!!!
@_date: 2013-12-19 01:42:02
"Have you forgotten that just a few short months ago it was at $200" if i had 1 uBTC everytime that was said...
@_date: 2013-12-22 02:04:24
how can you tell?
@_date: 2013-12-21 09:15:16
not sure why people are getting nasty about it but i guess there is nothing anyone can do, just take it as a lesson and move on.
@_date: 2013-12-03 10:10:41
why are these scammers allowed to advertise on here?
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:28:26
how much we talking? if its big enough to harm your financial well being then yes i would do it and pay the bank fee. so what if you lose your account with coin base. just consider yourself lucky.
@_date: 2013-12-26 15:23:20
whats  driving it up? i can't make sense of all this.
@_date: 2013-12-18 09:23:44
its as if no bad new ever happens in the bitcoin world, everything is "good news"
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:16:24
lol, i've gone from using this subreddit to "enlightening" myself about bitcoin to reading it to get a good laugh.
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:02:49
I figured that out a while ago, unless your comments are 100% positive you're most likely going to get downvoted to hell.
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:32:35
maybe, however i'm sure there are enough fools out there who will keep buying above that ;)
@_date: 2013-12-22 08:03:18
so how are the "leet and pros" addressing the issue ?
@_date: 2013-12-20 05:32:24
what are you on about? BTC china is back up at 4000+
@_date: 2013-12-03 07:54:09
wth how does this even happen? i thought all wallets are supposed to be random? 
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:56:37
that's my outlook as well.
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:12:26
not bad at all /s 
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:02:11
are you that clueless? there are many out there who paid  over 1200. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:49:27
maybe that's the difference though,at 0.001 i'm sure you're fine and most likely made good profit on this bubble, you can't expect the ones who bought at 1200 to feel the same.
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:52:23
i've been trying for a week now without luck.
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:15:19
now that the government want to regulate bitcoin it ha become less attractive to many Chinese who have been using it to hide/move money overseas. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:10:38
and you expect them to be happy about their bad decision?  how much have you lost?
@_date: 2013-12-20 05:36:53
random comparisons? what's the point?
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:34:16


@_date: 2013-12-07 09:05:18
a bubble is an understatement lol
@_date: 2013-12-22 01:51:36
Why are we just finding out about this now? what is being done about this?
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:45:48
"to the moon"  is all the reasoning you need.
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:05:56
apples and oranges. gold and silver hold value and it always will, what value does bitoin have other than its future use as a currency? 
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:22:14
actually it is bad news, they've said it isn't a currency which undermines bitcoin's goals and puts it in the ranks of wow gold and second life money.
