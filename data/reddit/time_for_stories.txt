If only there were some way to stabilize exchange rates through a central bank...

Bitcoin *is* an investment. It's not as risk free or as liquid as government backed currency so why would anyone invest in it if the yield did not justify it? The fact that people think they can make money off this has generated the attention that allowed Bitcoin to enter the public eye.
Holding currency in a savings account is preferable to having currency as Bitcoin. First, it is more liquid and is commonly accepted as a medium of exchange. Secondly, the government insures these deposits (risk reduction!) and thirdly the currency is regulated by the central bank and is far less volatile than bitcoin (risk reduction!). You won't wake up one day and find that your $1000 NPV turns into $500 NPV the next day. You gain anonymity but at high capital loss risk.

That is complete bullshit. This sub is like a goddamn echo chamber.

This thread sounds very much like an argument against getting insurance.

And look at how stable bitcoin is in comparison!

Everytime someone talks about economics here I just get angry. Some of the posts just blow me away with the level of ignorance. Whenever this subject is discussed everyone is suddenly an expert. No, no, no just let the people with actual knowledge from a job or a degree post.
