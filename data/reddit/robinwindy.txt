@_date: 2018-05-29 05:02:37
The best experience is your great sensei.
@_date: 2018-05-22 09:02:23
yes and when this happen many hud'lers will be very happy
@_date: 2018-05-16 10:37:17
I think if you are bitcoin traders it is important to have segwit in that platform
@_date: 2018-05-28 14:09:45
ha.ha. this is what we call lambo if you invest in the wrong coin and eventually goes to dip and never never rise again
@_date: 2018-05-04 06:55:41
@_date: 2018-05-13 12:33:35
Wow. You are such a lucky man...
@_date: 2018-05-10 14:35:58
what about PHP?Are you referring for a crypto or a money?
@_date: 2018-05-08 15:18:27
well said but of course there is a certain risk on that
@_date: 2018-05-01 05:15:28
i think it will recover after a couple of hours and not considering it as a dip
@_date: 2018-05-18 11:10:12
nice mosaic art...
@_date: 2018-05-03 02:38:00
Very good idea. 
@_date: 2018-05-03 02:51:52
I like it. 
@_date: 2018-05-01 04:35:46
That's great. i think the merchants on that place has the positive views how cryptocurrency is very important in the future. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 06:09:26
Huge. because of high fees.
@_date: 2018-05-13 12:15:03
just hang on their it will recover bro
@_date: 2018-05-18 09:16:15
I agree nice thinking
@_date: 2018-05-01 04:21:37
Yeah. We do hope that with in this week it will break the 10k walls
@_date: 2018-05-28 14:29:08
thats a losing sale!
@_date: 2018-05-03 02:47:56

@_date: 2018-05-29 14:49:46
bitcoin definitely can recover from this dip.the question is when?
@_date: 2018-05-03 15:38:56
Yes and I think it will passed that eventually
@_date: 2018-05-01 04:57:32
Maybe You need further studies how bitcoin works in the market and how adoption will bring to his ATH sooner or later
@_date: 2018-05-02 14:14:14
I think it will drop from 12 k to 11 or 10 k but It will bounce back again
@_date: 2018-05-18 14:49:37
what do you prefer between pepsi and coke?
@_date: 2018-05-05 06:07:44
Indeed It was helpful
@_date: 2018-05-19 09:56:02
you are indeed correct. reddit is not good source of informations if this market will come up or fullback because there are lots of comments that are unnecessary.sometimes it is only just a memes
@_date: 2018-05-23 10:10:56
hope to join this team.
@_date: 2018-05-19 11:47:39
yes because because they are holding the largest share in this market
@_date: 2018-05-24 14:54:46
i think it i the best time to hold and produce better
@_date: 2018-05-09 02:31:29
We are still over $9k 
@_date: 2018-05-28 14:16:32
yeah it i really cool.
@_date: 2018-05-18 14:59:06
haha.because they are afraid?is that so?
@_date: 2018-05-18 08:53:40
I think it will not go below 8k anymore.there are lots of good news in the community right now,so if you want to buy do it now
@_date: 2018-05-08 15:07:20
Ha.ha. LOL!!
@_date: 2018-05-28 23:14:53
Something like that hehe
@_date: 2018-05-19 10:38:50
Yeah better to hold right now
@_date: 2018-05-10 14:05:04
Ha.ha. maybe
@_date: 2018-05-09 03:25:44
We were already alienated so we can live on the moon. 
@_date: 2018-05-20 13:40:03
is this bitcoin has been taken?
@_date: 2018-05-18 07:39:41
Maybe $7500 but if there is a bull run,it will reach $8500
@_date: 2018-05-06 10:49:25
Ha!Ha. You are right bro. They wait to break the 10k wall actually watching binance wall it break in a blink of an eye an then return to below 10k
@_date: 2018-05-22 09:04:02
yes we ill be very happy if starting to climb. hud'lers just be ready for the take 0ff
@_date: 2018-05-17 06:36:25
what a statistic. I think rich getting richer and poor getting poorer.
@_date: 2018-05-17 06:52:57
Wow!thats nice
@_date: 2018-05-19 11:13:12

@_date: 2018-05-04 09:32:58
Best currency ever!
@_date: 2018-05-01 04:02:20
Yes and rich also with the opinions and emotions of the people losing and gaining in this community
@_date: 2018-05-25 16:10:27
bitcoin is all over, cryptocurrency will soon take over over the paper money that we use today.
@_date: 2018-05-27 09:48:40
i like the quote, now at digital age trust is the most important thing. you should have trust to invest to something that you dont see like bitcoin. we dont wee it but we know its there.
@_date: 2018-05-01 04:08:05
Maybe before the end of this day it will break that 9.5 k .4 hours ago has it at 9345., so I think it can break that
@_date: 2018-05-18 11:04:36
Really in the Philippines will be mined? I think this is in the losing because they are among the highest cost of electricity in the world and also try their net connections is very poor
@_date: 2018-05-24 15:13:20
hA.HA. that's too far
@_date: 2018-05-04 03:19:36
I agree!
@_date: 2018-05-27 05:25:58
Haha! Nice one!
@_date: 2018-05-03 02:20:59
@_date: 2018-05-07 15:23:15
seriously haha. but nice sense of humor for the author of this
@_date: 2018-05-31 12:52:52
crypto wins simply because it is more convenient to use and with hassle free transactions.
@_date: 2018-05-09 04:16:50
@_date: 2018-05-03 02:05:41
Bitcoin is the father of crypto currency.
@_date: 2018-05-05 14:03:31
Yes and it was beneficial to all trader in this community
@_date: 2018-05-18 07:34:07
i agree.holding it for a while,waiting for the bull to come out
@_date: 2018-05-01 14:21:35
Yeah me too. It will climb agin at 9k wall but I hope this coming week it will break the 9.5 walls
@_date: 2018-05-16 13:28:58
this conversations is very helpful ex
specially to the newbie here because they may consider the following discussion before entering in the in the mining industry of this currency
@_date: 2018-05-03 02:59:49
Woah. 4million left. 
@_date: 2018-05-18 14:10:35
it is the most expensive wallpaper in Africa
@_date: 2018-05-12 17:15:45
Wow this is a great plans. I think millennials better in preparing their future and quite a risk taker
@_date: 2018-05-28 23:33:07
Amazing saving energy is great and the important one they cost less in electricity.
@_date: 2018-05-18 13:11:33
i hope it will have its run not walk.waiting for the right time. in the mean time hold it for a while
@_date: 2018-05-18 08:36:17
just wait  if you are holding some coins it will have its bullrun.timing is very importANT 
@_date: 2018-05-02 01:20:40
Over 9k again! 
@_date: 2018-05-18 09:11:38
I agree but that is not the only reason why the price will go up, it can also depend on a good news on community,adaptation and the market support.Even whales has the capacity to pump its price
@_date: 2018-05-18 09:00:11
If it goes down better buy but if not just hold on 
@_date: 2018-05-02 01:32:00
101% yes!
@_date: 2018-05-01 14:41:29
will wait and if it goes dip better buy but if not stay at the positioned and hold it for a  while
@_date: 2018-05-29 04:03:31
She holds but I'm HODL!!!
@_date: 2018-05-01 04:54:39

@_date: 2018-05-29 15:48:58
yes you are right.
@_date: 2018-05-13 12:47:56
Usually it crashes if there is a bad news in the media or whatsoever but eventually it will recover and bitcoin has prove that
@_date: 2018-05-18 13:59:00
the best investor is the one who never minds the relevancy but the profit he can get to his investment
@_date: 2018-05-09 02:25:50
Do you want to be Pickle-Rat like rick. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 12:41:51
Why? Doyou have any data that will support that? but I like anyway that 2nd part? I wish this is true
@_date: 2018-05-02 13:56:59
i think it is best to hold it for a while right now. Maybe it will comeback in the top 
@_date: 2018-05-23 12:42:08
i think it will not break that 6k market it will start to bounce back
@_date: 2018-05-09 02:58:58
I would like to get one. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 17:25:42
Wow You are ready for you future. That is very nice to hear coming from the younger generations
@_date: 2018-05-04 05:17:22

@_date: 2018-05-28 14:41:56
ha.ha. you make me laugh!LOL....
@_date: 2018-05-23 12:43:53
Indeed absolutely correct
@_date: 2018-05-04 04:38:55
I agree. lol
@_date: 2018-05-01 04:55:24
I think that was quite less. I like the innovator to this process
@_date: 2018-05-29 15:01:54
yeah you are right , but sometimes trades though that this is a manipulations coming from the whales in order to control the price of bitcoin and gain more from their usual income.and i think this will be a very helpful for all knowing that this is a legitimate occurrence in the market
@_date: 2018-05-09 04:09:15
@_date: 2018-05-28 14:20:08
ha.ha. you will be paralyzed before you can drive that

@_date: 2018-05-19 12:02:42
Well said. It was the influence of the people that affects the government and I think if you have the money, You will be very influential
@_date: 2018-05-09 03:06:22
That's great! I haven't received mine yet.
@_date: 2018-05-18 10:00:50

@_date: 2018-05-09 03:20:54

@_date: 2018-05-18 08:32:15
haha, agree. don't think too much in changing this world. it is very heavy
@_date: 2018-05-09 02:49:45
Does robinhood suppport EOS?
@_date: 2018-05-03 15:37:15
Yes maybe it is very hard to break the 10k walls but if it will break it will moon and will not stop
@_date: 2018-05-05 04:05:54
Nice bro...LOL
@_date: 2018-05-18 13:30:51
You are right and even government in the European countries acknowledge the importance of this market in the financial sector
@_date: 2018-05-19 10:05:11
this is the place where the emotions and memes of the people bing expressed ab better not to be emotional in interpreting it
@_date: 2018-05-09 07:16:35
buliish???? right now?
@_date: 2018-05-19 13:34:50
ha.ha. maybe they will bring this thread close down haha!!
@_date: 2018-05-16 08:24:16
really haha.I think he is destined to hold it
@_date: 2018-05-25 00:23:57
i hope it will pusj through and bitcoin surpass this anomaly circling about it
@_date: 2018-05-03 00:11:02
It has no trans fee if you get btc there?
@_date: 2018-05-09 11:16:27
@_date: 2018-05-19 13:19:01
haha. they can do that
@_date: 2018-05-23 12:56:45
wow. I think it will reach fist the 10k market and if that happen I will be happy
@_date: 2018-05-30 03:00:01
 Well, It really helps a lot to us. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-05-18 11:19:36
agree. it has a good humor
@_date: 2018-05-09 03:44:19
I need to work so I will be able to add more Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 14:58:44
great point!!
@_date: 2018-05-06 12:50:42
you're right but I think maybe they are working on it
@_date: 2018-05-08 14:12:37
I notice that too
@_date: 2018-05-30 13:51:44
Oh man, wish China would have lifted that ban from crypto-currencies and ICOs.
@_date: 2018-05-01 04:00:07
We will wait for that time and I think they will do it with a big bang. So don't be caught sleeping.:)
@_date: 2018-05-16 10:29:36
indeed . I think costumer services is the most important if you have experience some problems in their platforms. It will help to lessen the agony of traders.
@_date: 2018-05-19 10:23:53
ha.ha. just hang on there bro. eventually you will gain in that investment
@_date: 2018-05-27 06:29:41
i agree thanks for the info 
@_date: 2018-05-23 09:36:06
nice presentation!
@_date: 2018-05-19 12:49:41
That's very rude, but the truth is I like it more bloody being mobbed by the people they robbed.
@_date: 2018-05-16 10:45:53
why did you say so?
@_date: 2018-05-19 11:52:03
yes it was imposibble to fall unless there is a major mistake in their management but it is still very impossible to happen
@_date: 2018-05-19 12:12:24
because they feel that the very existence of bitcoin and other cryptos in the market as a threat to their existence to the financial market
@_date: 2018-05-18 09:01:04
I hope we hit the 10k market, that is the time we can call a moon!
@_date: 2018-05-01 15:44:01
i don't have any Idea, maybe it is my personal opinion because it even we don't destroy nor damage a building it is a courtesy to ask if they want it otherwise we well look disrespectful to the owner.
@_date: 2018-05-16 10:15:58
What are their explanations about this?
@_date: 2018-05-04 06:34:43
Some of the banks don't accept fiat from crypto exchanges. Where do you live?
@_date: 2018-05-04 05:46:34
Use exchanges.
@_date: 2018-05-18 07:32:21
exactly,but when do you think the bear is gonna get out
@_date: 2018-05-01 05:17:45
I think adopting segwit in the platform is more advantageous than having not. It is making bitcoin transactions more faster and it will cost less for the traders
@_date: 2018-05-17 07:09:33
maybe but Rich people do not agree with that they want all the the thins in this world. if they want to help needy people maybe they can go to africa where there is a famine
@_date: 2018-05-28 13:51:34
haha. nice logo. this is a positive development in this market. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 07:16:58
they are preparing it right now
@_date: 2018-05-29 14:23:46
Yes i think this ii the best advice right now jut hold it and wait for the right time
@_date: 2018-05-19 10:45:33
it is only the press release but if you can see it was the no. coins in this thread
@_date: 2018-05-01 05:30:17
Bitcoin gaining grounds right now and even the big names in the published media cannot ignore it anymore the presence of the digital market in the community
@_date: 2018-05-24 15:14:46
I think the next thing will  happen is very difficult speculate
@_date: 2018-05-19 13:01:35
please.. be our guest!
@_date: 2018-05-29 05:10:40
 Haha Shutdown the bank!
@_date: 2018-05-29 15:43:00
wow this is such a good investments.
@_date: 2018-05-17 07:40:34
YES,it was vulnerable but not with dollars  but the news or fud being spread in this community
@_date: 2018-05-16 10:25:01
yes indeed but they are acquiring the services of other banks somewhere in europe to continue their business
@_date: 2018-05-24 16:16:22
yes indeed better to buy now than be sorry later
@_date: 2018-05-08 14:24:22
part of this community is the madness like that haha
@_date: 2018-05-01 03:57:06
Yes these traders are the people who have weak heart to handle this market. Maybe they are not oriented very well how this market works
@_date: 2018-05-04 06:38:20
Seems true.
@_date: 2018-05-19 12:09:20
of course the people in the government , the people who are rich and have the major stock in the financial system
@_date: 2018-05-03 02:13:44
That's why I never used coinbase. 
@_date: 2018-05-03 15:47:35
yeah. I agree with you and waiting to happen. Hud'lers will be very happy with that if happened
@_date: 2018-05-05 03:59:39
Yes and every one here is excited to break that 10k wall and now ready to post their comments
@_date: 2018-05-19 11:02:06
ha.ha. because it's victoria day?
@_date: 2018-05-27 06:42:20
I think not but im still waiting until it rises again, I think it depends on community news.
@_date: 2018-05-04 06:48:04
yes, what?
@_date: 2018-05-18 08:34:42
maybe yes, mYbe not, it depends how it ENDS.
@_date: 2018-05-02 01:22:22
My favorite grandpa. lol
@_date: 2018-05-09 10:51:32
you have a good sense od humor.. LOL
@_date: 2018-05-24 15:56:25
Definitely it is the best we can do right now with this bearish market, buy the dip and wait for the moon and REPEAT!
@_date: 2018-05-05 04:24:36
I agree with the tracking of blockchainmI think you will have the full control of your money
@_date: 2018-05-29 14:08:05
yes it is good for bitcoin and I hope this market will regain it's former glory in the ecosystem 
@_date: 2018-05-18 08:34:00
i hope it will sustain it so that we can recover from the last dip
@_date: 2018-05-01 03:58:12
Maybe, maybe not why maybe it will be a good news for the late comers who wants to buy their shares of bitcoin and this will be  a chance for them
@_date: 2018-05-29 15:23:28
is this a good news. I hope it can uplink the pictures aroud this place
@_date: 2018-05-28 15:04:40
i hope it will hit the 12k in the middle of JUne,2017.
@_date: 2018-05-24 15:00:21
i think it was and looking a  possbility that next
there is t the thread 
@_date: 2018-05-17 07:37:47
agree this place is for the people who are willing to take a risk in order to gAins and if they loose they can handle  it and REPEAT
@_date: 2018-05-18 11:13:20
ha.ha. good to see everyday he pass that way
@_date: 2018-05-19 13:20:25
I think some bank are doing that in a secret manner because it will boomerang with them
@_date: 2018-05-16 10:48:19
sorry to hear this but if they want to stay in this market they should be able fix this problem
@_date: 2018-05-18 15:00:44
nice carthography!
@_date: 2018-05-19 12:22:02
I think they not need to shut it down but to regulate it is far more better because we be considerate to the people who will lost their jobs
@_date: 2018-05-10 14:34:51
that's very nice to here
@_date: 2018-05-25 01:36:02
nice presentation
@_date: 2018-05-05 06:17:01
Yes it show how the world is mature enough to accept bitcoin in this community
@_date: 2018-05-19 10:48:49
if we hit that bottom of 6.5 , that is the time to buy again
@_date: 2018-05-10 14:35:14
We hope there are many more people like you
@_date: 2018-05-29 14:00:25
i hope we can recover from this dip and we an have a drink if it hits a bullrun. looking positive haha..
@_date: 2018-05-12 17:03:58
ha.ha. but looking positive in this market it will bounce back nextweek. but it is the best time to buy right now
@_date: 2018-05-26 09:41:49
gold is the old fashion treasure, now we are in the digital age bitcoin rules!
@_date: 2018-05-19 11:13:55
This will be a search and retrieval operations for bitcoin. I love this game
@_date: 2018-05-04 06:39:42
They lied of course. $ is $ 
@_date: 2018-05-31 14:41:01
Just wait for the LN and we are good when it comes to fees issue.
@_date: 2018-05-13 13:04:23
Thats right unless you hit the jackpot and you have that big amount of money
@_date: 2018-05-24 16:11:52
maybe or maybe not. the support at 7 k is still very strong
@_date: 2018-05-02 14:27:58
Of course everyone here always talk about the prices of coins whether it is going dip or mooning. That's the priority of all traders here
@_date: 2018-05-25 01:12:11
after this issue of price manipulation i think it will recover if they found out that it was only few people and I hope they may found the culprit of this anomaly
@_date: 2018-05-29 15:19:34
I think it will be facts if this is supported by evidence. I hoe this market recovers
@_date: 2018-05-18 10:08:18
ha.ha. full of memes here on how to handle the instinct of the hud'lers
@_date: 2018-05-03 00:05:21
Satoshi is the best.
@_date: 2018-05-18 14:50:51
I think they need to re-oriented with their economic class
@_date: 2018-05-28 14:33:38
dreaming that they will go to he moon an buy their lambo
@_date: 2018-05-03 15:33:30
yes I think it will be a bullish especially right now traders are very positive in this community and the widespread adaptations of different coins in the market
@_date: 2018-05-19 10:19:19
and then buy and wait for a while
@_date: 2018-05-18 13:22:23
yes the technology it has will surpassed the value of the fiat
@_date: 2018-05-24 15:25:23
wow. but I think you should treat them as a friend
@_date: 2018-05-17 07:23:36
I love this movie" BRAVEHEART" when they want to be decentralized against the tyranny of the King of against England,Scotland wage a war  it. beautiful captions 
@_date: 2018-05-17 13:10:21
I think you have a point on that some of here are just staying here to spread fud or sometimes fomo 
@_date: 2018-05-30 10:18:48
@_date: 2018-05-13 13:12:21
Wow.. you are so rich. and very lucky
@_date: 2018-05-19 11:34:53
nice piece of Art. I think the artist is a crypto enthusiast
@_date: 2018-05-17 06:44:52
this is sad life haha. That is why some nationals want to have a communist type of government to have equality but there is no perfect government though to facilitate that model  government or Utopia.
@_date: 2018-05-17 13:06:18
why do yo think this is useless?
@_date: 2018-05-24 06:10:16
sounds good!... i think this is the start of embracing the used of bitcoins
@_date: 2018-05-24 16:13:00
but eventually bitcoin will recover as the usual pattern in this market
@_date: 2018-05-04 04:37:49
No need to worry. just keep hodling. 
@_date: 2018-05-03 02:09:32
Technology is the future. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 03:13:20
Nice. Great work Vaultoro. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 12:56:54
is that the way we can buy a lambo .ha.ha.
@_date: 2018-05-24 15:55:38
it is time to buy and hold it for a while
@_date: 2018-05-18 09:19:41
Right now we are looking to A BULLRUN. we may expect a climb in the market price because of the positive new about the community
@_date: 2018-05-19 10:03:54
if that happen, i think buyer should prefer for it
@_date: 2018-05-01 14:47:52
maybe that is imposible to touch the 4500 not even the 7k .Maybe if bitcoin will dip it is between 7.5 to 8.5k
@_date: 2018-05-19 11:36:16
it is just an art, but we do hope that bitcoin will be burning hot going to the moon
@_date: 2018-05-28 14:37:29
I think if I can have a mustang I am already contented to have that car in my garage. I hope we can dreams and will be true. hoping for the moon...
@_date: 2018-05-22 14:42:34
ha.ha. lets be positive it either way...
@_date: 2018-05-18 08:54:23
Me,just hanging as long as I can
@_date: 2018-05-28 14:52:35
haha. you are correct but the time when that's come is the problem...
@_date: 2018-05-29 14:55:00
haha. nice one. so there is a regular payment for regular bitcoin analysis. that's nice...
@_date: 2018-05-17 07:14:18
I think there is no data that will reveal who are the people who gains a lot in this market
@_date: 2018-05-01 04:13:25
I think it is more likely to be at 9k again and within this week it will break the 10k walls
@_date: 2018-05-10 14:46:47
mee too. I hope I have the same leverage 
@_date: 2018-05-29 15:35:08
Blockchain will dominate this world sooner or later and cryptos will be the currency of the future. I love this community.
@_date: 2018-05-19 12:35:47
Indeed it was a symbolic piece of art that this community love to see because they are looking at the bank as the barriers that holding this community in full adaptations
@_date: 2018-05-04 06:48:36
Definitely yes.
@_date: 2018-05-05 06:06:50
I think bitcoin are slowly gaining the adaptation process in the market and people are very positive on it.
@_date: 2018-05-16 08:20:05
haha ilovethis thread 
@_date: 2018-05-10 14:24:48
Ha.ha. really?
@_date: 2018-05-27 06:50:00
Keep hodling till the price rises.IT will helps you gains eventually...
@_date: 2018-05-29 13:49:57
ha.ha nice. but we  all do hope that this market recovers from this dip so that all of us will be happy. lets hope that it will start it's bullrun
@_date: 2018-05-19 10:33:10
i think weak hands trader should not be here, they must be investing their money in the bank for safekeeping. This community is the place fo the risk taker only
@_date: 2018-05-29 16:17:55
it looks good, maybe we could try this one also.
@_date: 2018-05-18 08:49:47
I know,but why would you do that if it gives profits/benefits?
@_date: 2018-05-31 12:53:41
@_date: 2018-05-12 17:49:08
among the crypto currency, bitcoin price is the most important because every currency follows.
@_date: 2018-05-04 06:54:43
Thanks for sharing. Lets spread this.
@_date: 2018-05-20 13:56:18
maybe you can ask their support they may able to sort it out for you
@_date: 2018-05-28 14:42:41
scrap it, hold it sell it and then buy...
@_date: 2018-05-18 14:55:24
wow thats huge . But I am not praying to have the asteroid come to our planet.
@_date: 2018-05-16 13:29:36
stay calm review your portfolio and  have coffee and relax
@_date: 2018-05-03 03:13:05
Break.... 
@_date: 2018-05-23 09:37:34
that's good!...
@_date: 2018-05-01 14:30:28
This may even surpass that just wait for a while maybe tomorrow it will be at 9.5 k
@_date: 2018-05-01 04:01:23
I think it is not yet a dip. It is just a little setback maybe traders taking some rest but pretty sure this is not a dip
@_date: 2018-05-05 04:17:12
Yeah you are right. Eventually it will replace mastercard in all transactions
@_date: 2018-05-30 10:20:27
that's true!..lets educate the newbies in bitcoin industry!...that would be a great help for them!
@_date: 2018-05-28 15:11:25
yes it is the time to buy at the lowest price and when this market will regain its strength i think if this will do, we can have our money going to the moon
@_date: 2018-05-01 04:52:18
what haha...the size of the cake is the basis of transaction fees?
@_date: 2018-05-29 05:06:55
Gift cards for loved ones would be nice.
@_date: 2018-05-13 13:06:51
wow. I hope this meme is supported by data or even a news
@_date: 2018-05-12 14:36:05
just think positive ;)
@_date: 2018-05-22 14:13:08
i think it will ,because of the positive outlook of the community, we can expect it to bounce back
@_date: 2018-05-27 05:46:39
That's nice for people want to know more information in crypto.
@_date: 2018-05-16 08:15:58
i think this is only part of the cycle in this community it will be back
@_date: 2018-05-03 00:16:03
@_date: 2018-05-18 11:20:36
haha. sarcasm works...
@_date: 2018-05-18 13:26:21
yes because it is widely accepted and when full adaptation will push through this will be huge
@_date: 2018-05-12 17:39:33
indeed we are happy being here.
@_date: 2018-05-10 14:07:21
just wait and see
@_date: 2018-05-02 13:57:54
i think it will recover all that lost during the dip.
@_date: 2018-05-01 03:55:50
I think this is just a usual push and pull scenario but if you are looking at this community looking stronger I think the 9k wall is very easy to recover for bitcoin
@_date: 2018-05-27 07:10:08
ha.ha. you nailed it bro.
@_date: 2018-05-13 12:59:55
I hope I have a 1200 bitcoin what ever its price
@_date: 2018-05-18 09:20:53
if you buy now I am very sure that you will have profit, the real question is when you will sell it?
@_date: 2018-05-28 13:59:36
you are right sometimes they banned you if they think you are against with their idea.
@_date: 2018-05-25 00:34:35
i think they are just here watching and waiting that this storm with bitcoin pass and horaaahhh.. another beautiful day
@_date: 2018-05-18 09:18:35
I think community very positive especially after the meetings
@_date: 2018-05-01 04:42:09
But it was quite amazing, bitcoin are now use as a medium of payment
@_date: 2018-05-05 04:43:16
if adaptation will be worldwide I think bitcoin will record another ATH
@_date: 2018-05-27 07:00:09
wow. that's nice.  
@_date: 2018-05-01 05:35:09
yes. bitcoin is gaining its ground now and adoption of different establishment are making it more sustainable especially to its users and traders
@_date: 2018-05-18 09:58:27
ha.ha.is that so?I think sometimes you have to yield down especially if you do not have the data to support a claim
@_date: 2018-05-18 13:01:43
haha.maybe nextyear and next year again. 25k much more possible
@_date: 2018-05-04 04:43:58
I hope $10k for this month of may. 
@_date: 2018-05-29 05:49:04
Wow! congrats to Croatia!
@_date: 2018-05-03 02:16:00
@_date: 2018-05-01 04:56:41
this will be the start of greater adoption of bitcoin in the market
@_date: 2018-05-19 12:41:13
This thread is going to be a discussions among the bankers and the traders of this community
@_date: 2018-05-24 15:21:29
maybe it was in a dump, but I am pretty sure that it will bounce back
@_date: 2018-05-01 04:56:09
Why do you think it is a lie?
@_date: 2018-05-17 06:55:30
maybe studying political science it is a pre-requisite for the bachelor of law.
@_date: 2018-05-25 16:05:01
i agree to this. bitcoin investor need more privacy for more security of their investment
@_date: 2018-05-07 15:50:54
@_date: 2018-05-05 14:24:10
Yes indeed! Futur will come that bitcoin will be the medium of  exchange in real world replacing Fiat
@_date: 2018-05-24 16:19:45
maybe but the support at the 7k is very strong
@_date: 2018-05-01 04:40:22
This is quite informative.Thank you for this.
@_date: 2018-05-19 11:28:58
Do we have a winner to this GAME?
@_date: 2018-05-19 11:21:07
yes I feel you bro. tried that also ha.ha.
@_date: 2018-05-12 17:04:35
LOL. Ha.ha. just be cool everything will be alright guys
@_date: 2018-05-10 15:01:52
nice sattire...
@_date: 2018-05-28 23:21:59
When bitcoin price is cents.
@_date: 2018-05-10 01:41:23
Haha! 
@_date: 2018-05-05 04:16:32
Wow. that's great. bitcoin is getting easier to pay
@_date: 2018-05-23 12:49:16
Ha.ha. Maybe but I think it is very impossible to reach that bottom
@_date: 2018-05-20 10:02:43
Same,but im also exited for another bull run
@_date: 2018-05-18 13:42:28
yes it is true and it is you who who will decide if it is good or not if not. there are many fudlers in this thread
@_date: 2018-05-19 11:20:31
and find nothing, that will make you sleep...
@_date: 2018-05-17 07:05:19
haha. same here just reading and learning how they explains things in this thread
@_date: 2018-05-10 14:04:49
wow that is how long you will handle a bitcoin. I know it will be a good investments
@_date: 2018-05-29 14:12:17
and that path I hope will prevail.ha.ha. just like what he did at the avengers...LOL...
@_date: 2018-05-09 07:19:35
good to have that conference and I think everyone here will be waiting how it will go.
@_date: 2018-05-24 15:08:37
I think if bitcoin with that value , bitcoin team will emerge eventually
@_date: 2018-05-29 15:10:20
yes and still in a positive side this market will regain it former glory 
@_date: 2018-05-24 14:44:16
i think this market will recover knowing how it perform in the market
@_date: 2018-05-10 01:12:15
This is true.
@_date: 2018-05-19 10:40:08
This is what we call thinking positively!Yeah dude I hope we hit that again
@_date: 2018-05-18 13:45:14
haha. it does'nt matter whether he is relevant or not but the point is he continues to earn billions
@_date: 2018-05-18 13:37:42
ha.ha. why because this is full of memes
@_date: 2018-05-04 05:32:42
Nice. I like it.
@_date: 2018-05-09 07:51:12
I think bet the 9 to 10 k bitcoin will roam around
@_date: 2018-05-10 03:01:20
I agree with McAfee well explained about bitcoin. Not the prediction.
@_date: 2018-05-13 12:14:20
@_date: 2018-05-07 14:54:17
I think it is part of the business cycle and in this part of cycle bitcoin is the star and i think bitcoin is the standard of this market
@_date: 2018-05-30 03:12:14
 Nice shirts!
@_date: 2018-05-01 14:50:26
Did the bank knows this? Maybe yes  but they are using the picture of that building maybe they need a permission
@_date: 2018-05-19 10:17:35
very nice suggestion. just relax have a coffe ,and watch movie 
@_date: 2018-05-19 10:16:14
ths is what they called "Tether Fud"
@_date: 2018-05-09 03:18:18
That's great! I really want to experienced that.
@_date: 2018-05-18 07:45:48
just hold on guys,we will get what we want
@_date: 2018-05-19 13:14:35
it was a representations that someday cryptocurrency will overrun the banking industry
@_date: 2018-05-17 12:58:20
haha. I hope bitcoin recover form its dip
@_date: 2018-05-18 11:05:12
I think they need reforms to do that
@_date: 2018-05-19 12:52:11
It was a nice painting but very strong expression against them.
@_date: 2018-05-07 14:56:00
Wow its nice to hear this another adaptation of bitcoin in the market
@_date: 2018-05-29 14:29:56
i think you need a time machine but if you can invent it, you don't need this market anymore ha.ha....
@_date: 2018-05-23 12:44:29
I think if they do that, instead of gaining they will lost, better to hold it for a while
@_date: 2018-05-30 03:17:09
  True! they will.
@_date: 2018-05-19 12:07:04
banks are very influential that if the government don't have the political will to implement the law, then they will be prone to corruptions
@_date: 2018-05-04 04:35:54
Adaptation everywhere is nice to see in this sub.
@_date: 2018-05-10 01:18:02
I read an article. Tom Lee predict $15000 next week.
@_date: 2018-05-17 07:24:40
they even tell you that you will lose or being scammed haha
@_date: 2018-05-13 12:44:26
I think they are trying to spread Fud,but who are financing this fudlers maybe banks? or who will benefit every crash?
@_date: 2018-05-19 12:59:20
you are definitely correct it is like a peaceful revolutions against the oligarch that controlling the financial system of the country
@_date: 2018-05-28 11:11:33
I agree with you brudda
@_date: 2018-05-13 12:57:33
a kidnap for a ransom? maybe they paid her a 10 bitcoin
@_date: 2018-05-09 11:15:26
I think bitcoin is very strong above 9k
@_date: 2018-05-10 03:07:18
Good share. Newbie needs to watch this.
@_date: 2018-05-03 02:23:02
Can't find EOS Building.
@_date: 2018-05-19 12:08:44
of course the people in the government , the people who are rich and have the major stock in the financial system
@_date: 2018-05-01 03:59:12
Most of the serious traders with a big investment is holding their btc right now. they have a more positive views that this market will be mooning. Just waiting for the right time
@_date: 2018-05-30 10:58:10
what is this lightning app?  
@_date: 2018-06-12 17:09:03
@_date: 2018-06-02 23:22:47
I think this is the business of the future and we are not limited  to the   physical form of economics but now it is becoming complex because of the technology. I think you have the right idea taking computer science and economics to know better how market react to different factors in the community
@_date: 2018-06-11 00:52:50
sometimes hurting has a positive outcome!
@_date: 2018-06-11 02:25:46
it is a volatile market, so, spent wisely
@_date: 2018-06-10 13:01:11
sometimes holding too much means loosing more!
@_date: 2018-06-06 22:47:32
yes it was really working.
@_date: 2018-06-05 15:27:19
hospital bills?..it's a wow!...so convenient to go with this  hospital!..really a big change in the history of coins!..congratz!
@_date: 2018-06-14 01:07:25
lol, pokemon afte 30days down to 1/4 of its users.. :)
@_date: 2018-06-08 22:35:29
i think BTC miners should consider using solar power for operation?
@_date: 2018-06-03 12:28:45
wow!..this is great!...where exactly in Queensland?..advantage to the people who wants to enjoy in Queensland!
@_date: 2018-06-02 03:35:45
i hope this will also be available in our country.
@_date: 2018-06-08 17:54:11
just hodl guys
@_date: 2018-06-14 14:21:00
here comes the Bull!
@_date: 2018-06-08 22:37:39
bitcoin iced cofee... much better.... :)
@_date: 2018-06-11 11:32:09
yes i agree with you, that's also my understanding about what he's talking about. "Never a better time to invest... than now."
@_date: 2018-06-14 14:12:45
temporarily, it will be bullish again!
@_date: 2018-06-11 02:28:57
i don't! invest! that's the key
@_date: 2018-06-08 22:40:14
BTC is everywhere
@_date: 2018-06-11 02:31:07
Yeah, stay calm, it is starting to go up.....step by step
@_date: 2018-06-06 22:00:46
ha.ha. indeed!
@_date: 2018-06-11 02:37:25
careful, investing needs to be cautious..
@_date: 2018-06-06 22:03:16
what sorry to hear that... is this a joke!!!
@_date: 2018-06-10 09:33:46
They lack discipline,simple law sometimes they cannot follow.for example they throw their garbage somewhere thats why their country is mostly flooded
@_date: 2018-06-11 02:41:14
Going up, wait further! it will be bulllish
@_date: 2018-06-06 22:54:37
yes it is appreciating. it is a collectible toys that usually aapreciate in value. I am also collecting it too besides my bitcoin
@_date: 2018-06-14 22:55:10
I think  this is huge if you had millions in the bank. but looking at this interest rate, banks cannot give that interest rate even for a year or even for a time deposits. Imagine if you loan a car with the bank they are only giving 5 to 6% profit from your loan. so how can they give the 5% interest while they have also their operating expenses to shoulder.
 
@_date: 2018-06-07 22:05:34
this is the time for the miners
@_date: 2018-06-09 18:02:10
yes exactly!...that is the possibility of bitcoin in the future!..so excited!..let us now start investing in bitcoins as much as we can!
@_date: 2018-06-10 13:31:14
Why love the dip if there is always a way up? that's what matters...
@_date: 2018-06-11 01:19:01
Crypto is volatile, whatever happens it'll be affected...hold onto it....whatever causes the drop, it will be temporary again
@_date: 2018-06-01 04:28:07
You're right it will have cost you a lot as to compare to the segwit wallets
@_date: 2018-06-01 04:26:45
I think right now bitcoin is very stable in 7.5 ka and it is climbing although at the very low manners
@_date: 2018-06-12 23:47:28
wow. that is too long too handle. i hope I have that leverage haha. I am a short term holder only.
@_date: 2018-06-11 02:38:29
indeed! freeze! wait for your luck!LOOL

@_date: 2018-06-03 08:52:51

Worth a wait, the trends seems it ca go way beyond 3K
@_date: 2018-06-12 05:02:57
For a volatile market, hard to tell! But its so tempting! 
@_date: 2018-06-10 06:11:02

@_date: 2018-06-03 01:35:38

@_date: 2018-06-09 09:17:22

@_date: 2018-06-12 12:17:57

@_date: 2018-06-08 22:36:57
i think this is impossible
@_date: 2018-06-14 01:08:38
this is really big news
@_date: 2018-06-14 14:24:40
who manipulates the prices? The whales again?
@_date: 2018-06-11 02:14:16
Red is the color for the crypto right now, Cool!as it is just cooling down
@_date: 2018-06-03 06:53:34

Agree! that will give you air in between, to invest or not
@_date: 2018-06-01 10:48:22
for sure, bitcoin will win!..how and where to vote?
@_date: 2018-06-11 02:11:03
excuses, excuses, excuses! 
@_date: 2018-06-07 21:58:25
this is good idea but i think this will only work on high profile people.
@_date: 2018-06-14 14:38:23
agree.......worth another wait....
@_date: 2018-06-12 13:33:21
wow this is really an amazing one! and i'm excited to use this and it makes our life easy. 
@_date: 2018-06-03 05:43:40
that is really the excitement of investing in BTC, imagine you could earn more that you expected in just 1 click..but make sure that you keep an eye on it, don't blink!..in just a matter of seconds, everything will change!
@_date: 2018-06-01 09:41:40
actually, crypto trading accounts is convenient and exciting but risky.  however, if you will choose the best exchange, you will succeed!...
@_date: 2018-06-12 10:45:14
bitcoin was invented as an innovative payment network and a new kind of money. this video is worth to watch, thanks a lot! this was a big help!!!
@_date: 2018-06-10 09:48:58
thats why this this crypto currency is helpful to unemployed people,but people in Philippines keep calling it a scam 
@_date: 2018-06-14 14:18:07
sometimes it is hard to predict, it is so fragile that it is almost impossible to predict.
@_date: 2018-06-02 16:16:00
exactly!.. do your part first before aiming for the return!
@_date: 2018-06-06 22:28:59
i think that is getting nearer. But I do hope it recovers for a while.
@_date: 2018-06-10 07:11:31
it's a huge amount, but  its possible!..looking at the response of the crpto world, you will be amazed and not doubting that this will really happen!
@_date: 2018-06-08 17:52:16
thanks for the warning sir
@_date: 2018-06-10 00:33:46
really? i think the owner of that apartment see the potential of HODL btc
@_date: 2018-06-10 00:23:42
just be careful in holding your coins guys
@_date: 2018-06-14 14:44:15
as the trend implies, it will! now its between 3000-4000
@_date: 2018-06-14 21:53:47
yes you are correct. Mining is very profitable especially last november to december last year but I think right now the cost of investment over the amount you will mine is somewhat very small gains because of the cost of investment and the bill you will have with the power consumptions.
@_date: 2018-06-01 04:53:08
ha.ha.Why you want to do that
@_date: 2018-06-11 02:15:16
Up we wait!
@_date: 2018-06-08 21:51:58

you got it man!..there's no reason to argue with!...just invest and secure our future...that would be the best thing that we could in cryptocurrency!..
@_date: 2018-06-11 01:48:33
In this world, anything that goes up must come down.  But the earth revolves and rotate, so wait till it come up, on top!!
@_date: 2018-06-07 23:17:56
i think only national bank should be allowed to make money. how come private bank is making money?
@_date: 2018-06-11 01:33:55
Of course there is a set back, but knowing this platform, investing means willing to risk some.  We don't know, time will say: payback time!.
@_date: 2018-06-01 04:33:51
Ha.ha. good point. if every one here just buy 1 bitcoin it will a huge movement . Looking at bitcoin I think this is still a good coins and will eventually  rise again

@_date: 2018-06-08 22:30:09
why sir?
@_date: 2018-06-06 22:09:58

@_date: 2018-06-13 07:38:21

@_date: 2018-06-14 02:48:23
nice app.....it will help you a lot!..goodluck!
@_date: 2018-06-03 01:40:39
why do you think are you doing haha!!
@_date: 2018-06-02 23:29:45
why not? Having background in economics will help you better understand how volume affects the prices in the market and how the market follows if there is a recession or depression and how it will affect the market
@_date: 2018-06-03 01:19:58
WHY? 
@_date: 2018-06-12 04:51:10
and BTC will benefit then,!!!
@_date: 2018-06-07 10:33:21
congrats to you sir. i hope i can buy that one also..
@_date: 2018-06-13 09:18:32
as long as it will run, then there's no problem in using old PC....meaning there's no need to buy a high end pc or laptop just to have BTC lightning node!
@_date: 2018-06-11 02:52:52
Careful, But if you can afford to loose your investment it'll be worth it....
@_date: 2018-06-13 07:36:44
ouch!..look bad!...we can't to anything for that, just wait until it moves up!...
@_date: 2018-06-07 14:50:49
rushing to accept bitcoin as a payment?..if that's the case, then this is a good news for bitcoin!....more and more investors are coming for sure..
@_date: 2018-06-10 09:35:52
the people are the scam,not the bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-06-02 23:11:06
what a point haha.usually traders read the post at  this thread to give hints on what is happening on the market. in some point you are correct'
@_date: 2018-06-08 22:39:26
google can answer this for you
@_date: 2018-06-12 23:20:24
wow . this is great.looking the adaptations  in that country. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 22:39:43
i hope this improvement in the system will able bring a good news for the btc and bring it to life again. right now it is very stagnant and need to revive for this market. investors getting disinterested on how this market moves nowadays.
@_date: 2018-06-12 22:40:16
i think if bitcoin falls almost all coins follow. it is always the basis how the altcoins react in this market.
@_date: 2018-06-09 04:21:30
lol!...bitcoin is the currency of the internet and distributed worldwide.  Unlike traditional ccurrecies, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority, there is no government, company or bank incharge in it.
@_date: 2018-06-07 11:04:30
this is huge! bigger than the amount of money the third world country has.
@_date: 2018-06-14 14:29:58
whales where now buying again&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
@_date: 2018-06-01 04:45:38
I think it can reach that 8 k the possibility is good
@_date: 2018-06-14 21:39:44
lets hope for it. me too holding some of it.
@_date: 2018-06-08 21:53:06
very excellent idea!
@_date: 2018-06-09 09:16:33
this is more likely to happen in the near future
@_date: 2018-06-03 05:39:00
hhaahha....really true!..anyway, better to secure than to lost everything!..such a great advice..thankz
@_date: 2018-06-11 02:48:43
but don't sleep...I am telling you, worth the wait!LOL
@_date: 2018-06-03 00:10:40
you hear it because eos is the main event for this month as far as ICO is concern. They have the longest Ico promotions and the highest fund being raise for this whole year project
@_date: 2018-06-11 02:57:13
It does, and it will all the times.....it is very volatile so expect the dip...Hopefully it will bounce back in no time
@_date: 2018-06-08 17:16:39
thanks for the update, bitcoin still on top of the chain!
@_date: 2018-06-14 22:41:18
@_date: 2018-06-12 23:33:28
I think not. US will not withdraW their presence in the Korean Peninsula.
@_date: 2018-06-01 04:40:05
I hope this is true but right now I think it is more accurate it will can reach the 8k market but until there is no big news or adaptations in the usage of bitcoin it will climb slow 
@_date: 2018-06-14 14:50:38
another thing is the whales, controlling the market so they gain more........
@_date: 2018-06-07 10:38:06
just be patient in sending ticket sir.
@_date: 2018-06-12 05:18:47
better greedy than needy! if there is a chance go, provided you have enough gas!!!
@_date: 2018-06-06 22:22:21
yes it was started last 2nd week of january and the highlight is during the 2nd week of February that reach it's all time low in this year after reaching a 20k market.
@_date: 2018-06-02 23:06:01
what we can do, we can buy it right now and hold it for a while when the price is right ha.ha.
@_date: 2018-06-03 00:39:56
i think in the local area they more preferred the cash over visa although among the cities it is widely used because it is more secure than cash.
@_date: 2018-06-14 21:28:13
of course they will protect their investment. I think it may increase but in a slow down manner.
@_date: 2018-06-03 12:33:44
yes of course!....this is now the best time to invest!...invest now and earn later...that is the reality of bitcoin!..
@_date: 2018-06-14 14:55:42
HOLD,not being greedy nut wait, look at trends then go for the gold!LOL
@_date: 2018-06-03 01:07:46
it is very stable but also stagnant of his position right now. and traders is getting bored with this. I hope we get some movement upwards need to be bullish right now.
@_date: 2018-06-14 01:13:11
nc nc.. ill go HODL
@_date: 2018-06-08 13:28:23
what a great suggestion!...nice one..hope this will happen...even not now, at least in the future...
@_date: 2018-06-06 07:39:27
BTC still on top! the most trusted coin
@_date: 2018-06-09 18:05:29
wow!...really great!....an evidence that more and more merchants in different countries are accepting bitcoins as one of their payment method!.... congratz!
@_date: 2018-06-02 23:59:22
maybe they want to pump but it that happens hudlers will be awaken and this market will be in the bullish again. right now market is getting stagnant and it will results in less trading and interest among traders. I think this market needs a spark right now to survive. 
@_date: 2018-06-02 10:34:58
no wonder btc on the front page.. BTC is the pioneer in cryptocurrency!
@_date: 2018-06-14 02:49:55
yes definetely!....rapid growth due to increasing demands for bitcoin!...
@_date: 2018-06-01 11:06:43
How I wish that all of the online transaction aside from debit/credit card, they will accept Bitcoin as one of their payment method!
@_date: 2018-06-11 02:07:00
investors were cautious, observing, what could be their next move?
@_date: 2018-06-11 02:17:14
Yap! trending like that......guess its time for the investors
@_date: 2018-06-06 14:16:25
correct!..it's really happening now, but the problem is not all the people are engaged in bitcoin or any coins...but hopefully, maybe someday, it will happen
@_date: 2018-06-14 22:12:21
in this market, emotions should be remove because it will blind your reasoning and analytical ability in addressing this changes in the market especially it is very volatile market 
@_date: 2018-06-03 00:23:57
why did you say so?
@_date: 2018-06-10 11:31:48
i think investing is good right now and hold it before it bounce back 
@_date: 2018-06-12 05:30:43
I don't know men, but i think there will be a dip later, that's a good time to invest....
@_date: 2018-06-10 09:28:11
YES,maybe they are in the third world country but sometimes it sucks for them because they have the slowest internet in the region
@_date: 2018-06-10 00:24:53
OMG sorry for his loss
@_date: 2018-06-11 02:46:20
it is going up, wait steadily
@_date: 2018-06-08 13:31:17
oh see, even clubs are accepting bitcoins....what's next establishment will do this too?
@_date: 2018-06-10 10:03:30
I know but its better to HODL than to lose money
@_date: 2018-06-03 05:35:58
did you try it again bro?...maybe there's something wrong.. check also your connection...
@_date: 2018-06-06 23:01:29
i hope it will removethis taxing regulations will kill this market  
@_date: 2018-06-12 23:29:16
I hope it will start now. It is more acceptable to move it up in a slow moving rather than in a fast pace and eventually it will crush.
@_date: 2018-06-10 07:30:47
make sense!..that's actually the scenario and reasons why choosing crypto!.....i'll go for buying bitcoin!..
@_date: 2018-06-01 04:41:51
good point if there is a change in this week it was very minimal
@_date: 2018-06-12 23:00:11
every one has its own interest. this is the real world!
@_date: 2018-06-12 22:53:47
great statement! nailed it .
@_date: 2018-06-14 21:36:16
Good point. while btc price is down, it is the best time to invest especially if you had the leverage to do it,It is the best the best investment as to compare putting your money in the bank although there is a risk but the point of gaining is better than any investment
@_date: 2018-06-12 04:59:34
sometimes gambling pays!
@_date: 2018-06-10 00:22:42
really? now bitcoin is everywhere!
@_date: 2018-06-03 13:04:39
actually this is happening now.  there are more businesses even a small one accepting crypto as one of their mode of payment aside from credit card or paypal....with the rise of coins, it is actually expected!
@_date: 2018-06-09 10:06:25
this is good news! crypto business is booming!
@_date: 2018-06-11 01:29:10
please show proofs brother! so we were also be informed...
@_date: 2018-06-01 05:10:17
wow I hope this will be a positive movement for Bitcoin community. traders became lazy because of the stagnant movement in pricing.
I think this will bring hopes for the hudlers
@_date: 2018-06-03 00:52:22
Actually  bank uses the money we have there to invest in stock market and other investment and they only give us a fractions of interest they get in their investment. Sometimes they even invest it in this market. who knows haha...
@_date: 2018-06-07 10:40:11
thanks for this.. really a big help
@_date: 2018-06-11 02:43:17
Sky is falling into us!
@_date: 2018-06-11 02:03:09
Observe the trends, be cautious on investing
@_date: 2018-06-11 02:04:43
Giving up too soon? who knows? it starts first with the blood bath, after, tub of coins!LOLL
@_date: 2018-06-12 18:28:33
to the moon for sure! lol!
@_date: 2018-06-09 16:45:43
is it true?so amazing huh!.where actually in Philippines? so happy to see this, it only means that Filipinos are aware and knowledgeable with coins....
@_date: 2018-06-01 09:35:06
this is the technique!... if you want to enjoy bitcoin, do this!...:) :) :)
@_date: 2018-06-14 01:12:04
go japan
@_date: 2018-06-14 16:28:27
yes, there's no point in comparing!...nonsense!..bitcoin is doing great to compare with the bank..they are both in financial matter, but with different platforms?..so what's the issue?
@_date: 2018-06-14 22:00:34
ha.ha. let us be bullish right now.
@_date: 2018-06-02 10:35:16
no wonder btc on the front page.. BTC is the pioneer in cryptocurrency!
@_date: 2018-06-10 13:10:31
Worth the wait, right?
@_date: 2018-06-12 04:54:56
Probably manipulated by big whales.
@_date: 2018-06-01 04:36:25
ha.ha. I feel you bro. I have been in that feeling last year.
@_date: 2018-06-02 12:12:56

good old memories..
@_date: 2018-06-03 00:03:50
YES it is very easy to plan than in the actual market. In planning this market is very idealistic but if you are in haha. stress and pain comes to you and I hope they have the strength to endure it.
@_date: 2018-06-08 22:31:43

@_date: 2018-06-06 22:49:30
having LN will save you cost of electricity and also time, that is why many traders wants to adopt this 
@_date: 2018-06-12 22:47:15

@_date: 2018-06-05 22:16:49
yes they hold it because they know how bitcoin bounce back in the market.
@_date: 2018-06-01 04:29:56
ha.ha. I love the memes everytime we have a crash or we have a moon. Every body here have a reasons of their existence in this forum some are learning what is the market status through this arena
@_date: 2018-06-11 02:22:43

@_date: 2018-02-06 09:31:52
Something they should have done a long time ago.
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:30:20
Not if you are virgin.
@_date: 2018-02-01 09:45:58
So what are they doing?
@_date: 2018-04-24 13:52:13
Looking forward for a 10k marked. then it will be moon
@_date: 2018-04-18 12:03:09
wow I hope I can have just like that...PLATE! 
Maybe nextime I can see HUD'Lers :)
@_date: 2018-04-26 13:50:32

@_date: 2018-04-12 11:59:17
This is the bull run we are waiting for...
@_date: 2018-04-24 07:34:41
That's what I am waiting for 
@_date: 2018-04-11 00:05:38
It was a good memory. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 05:08:50
you are one of the lucky guys who have bitcoin in the earlier  stage and what I am thinking right now is how many bitcoin do you have
@_date: 2018-04-30 07:06:07
This market are getting pessimistic on how btc perform in the market. But I think before this month end It will break the 9.5 walls 
@_date: 2018-04-18 11:43:20
It's catchy maybe...LOL!
@_date: 2018-04-24 01:28:04
@_date: 2018-04-18 03:22:25
He gives you a tip.
@_date: 2018-04-18 03:02:17
Beautiful. How can I get one?
@_date: 2018-04-24 13:20:08
When that happen that will be the start that banking institutions should feel the pressure coming from the cryptomarket because people will be free from the regulations usually being imposed by the banks
@_date: 2018-04-30 13:34:00
if this mass adoption will push through I think every coins in this community will be in the moon. We are hoping for it especially we the crypto community
@_date: 2018-04-19 04:23:43
Bitcoin is on fire!
@_date: 2018-04-22 07:10:47
wow nice one bro. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 12:05:35
nice one bro
@_date: 2018-04-16 03:51:38
What have they done?
@_date: 2018-04-18 03:07:20
As usual. Lol
@_date: 2018-04-17 02:32:35
Probably. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 02:59:36
Congrats! Best wishes for both of you.
@_date: 2018-04-26 10:24:31
I think bitcoin are having a hard time to break the wall of 10 k but we are very positive that it can before the end of the month we already observe how fast it can get up for an hour only.Let's wait
@_date: 2018-04-13 04:19:26
Haha! Well played!
@_date: 2018-04-22 07:00:34
Wow that is so..so.. huge. I think if it touch the 10k mark I will be happy already
@_date: 2018-04-23 13:28:54
Of course this market are getting bigger and better most of the government right now are accepting cryptocurrency transactions in their financial sectors
@_date: 2018-04-18 03:53:56
Does GDAX allow my country to trade in their platform? 
@_date: 2018-04-21 11:48:59
I think traders are now having a positive thoughts with this bull run of bitcoin but I hope it breaks the wall of 9k. Right now this improvement of bitcoin able some traders to recover from the previous crash
@_date: 2018-04-24 12:24:18
I think it will break the 9300 resistance. Before the end of the week the 10 k will be the target
@_date: 2018-04-10 23:56:09
@_date: 2018-04-24 01:46:39
Looks interesting. Where did you get that? 
@_date: 2018-04-18 11:36:37
Yea I agree with you. It was quite informative. I hope he will update it from time to time
@_date: 2018-04-24 00:23:30
I really did it. Lol!
@_date: 2018-04-23 11:52:03
I think they need to improve this speed in order to make its adaptation better to the merchants
@_date: 2018-04-18 11:32:07
wow this is interesting data. What will happen if all bitcoins will be used in the daily trading?
@_date: 2018-04-21 11:38:01
Maybe this is a new development but we have different views on how bitcoin user and traders will benefit from this innovation.But one thing maybe bubbling my mind is that is is possible that it may contribute to wash trading for money for illegal activities because of confidential transactions? Maybe you can help me better understand this.
@_date: 2018-04-25 01:48:44
yeyeyeyeyeyeye. lol
@_date: 2018-04-24 12:57:59
Whatever the reasons of this bull run it will be beneficial to all especially to all hud'lers, go moon!!
@_date: 2018-04-16 04:21:23
Welcome and Goodluck! Hodl as long as you can!
@_date: 2018-04-12 15:23:11
I wished life was that easy.
@_date: 2018-04-25 02:48:02
Doesn't have a handle. Can't put the coffee in there. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 05:45:37
Great news!
@_date: 2018-04-12 15:49:57
I like this one, lovely creation!
@_date: 2018-04-10 23:58:48
Just how bullshit they're right?
@_date: 2018-04-23 15:54:04
Yeah that's very nice having gold and also storing bitcoins. i think this is the best investment
@_date: 2018-04-24 02:12:45
No need to worry. $10k Soon.  
@_date: 2018-04-16 12:11:46
Yes. bitcoin is the legend and the standard of this market.If bitcoin crash this whole market crash.
@_date: 2018-04-11 19:17:29
Now I understand why BTC crashed
@_date: 2018-04-18 11:39:34
maybe the hudl'ers do not expect that the price of bitcoin will fall and expect the other way
@_date: 2018-04-16 04:23:57
You figure that. So smart.
@_date: 2018-04-11 19:18:01
Big if true
@_date: 2018-04-27 00:24:52
Waiting for U.S to do the same. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 01:25:21
Good for Venezuelans. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 21:14:17
I wouldn't spend it wisely like this guy. You're a great exemple, forgot about all those expensive things, focus on living. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 13:23:38
I think they post it just to have a twist on their propaganda and make a talk not only of the town but also in the social media
@_date: 2018-04-11 18:04:03
who's the genius behind this?
@_date: 2018-04-25 02:29:29
@_date: 2018-04-24 00:23:11
@_date: 2018-04-23 09:25:51
I think if we include the law of supply, lesser volume means it will result to a high price but maybe it is not applicable to this market because sometimes volume is being hold by whales
@_date: 2018-04-24 12:34:36
We share the same experience with that lost but we are now very positive that we can recover eventually. Market are very positive right now and maybe because of this we can cut our losses
@_date: 2018-04-17 01:36:23
@_date: 2018-04-19 03:30:49
Good for you.
@_date: 2018-04-18 11:26:14
It was a common term used by the people who are holding their coins during crashes
@_date: 2018-04-19 03:38:52
It hurts right? 
@_date: 2018-04-30 06:49:52
Yes I think it will break that wall. It's week end today and I think this coming week will be breaking that wall
@_date: 2018-04-25 03:17:21
It's vanishing slowly. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 02:30:24
Lol. not that simple. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 02:16:26
$9k Soon!! I will add more btc today. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 05:00:15
What the purpose of this meme?LOL
@_date: 2018-04-24 07:53:36
hahaha. you are right. everytime someone is getting rich, someone also is getting poor. Sad Life...
@_date: 2018-04-23 13:34:01
Yeah I agree bitcoin will hit the 10k marked before the end of April because of the positive outlook of the community and many good news happening in the market right now
@_date: 2018-04-30 13:34:48
I think that is possible. Right now more countries are opening their door for the digital market
@_date: 2018-04-27 00:05:47
$1 per Satoshi in the future! 
@_date: 2018-04-26 10:52:29
Do you think this is the reason of sudden drop of bitcoin right now?
@_date: 2018-04-16 12:35:12
I think that's how the games being played off. Early Innovators and early adopters (Sometimes we called them early birds), face the biggest risk when a project starts and when it was a success they will benefit from that but if it falls they are the one with the biggest losses. The bigger the risk, the bigger the gains or lost
@_date: 2018-04-16 04:17:33
@_date: 2018-04-30 13:31:12
Nice ! Is this for real?
@_date: 2018-04-23 13:19:08
Its so funny but of course in this community we have a bias opinion for bitcoin against gold
@_date: 2018-04-24 01:47:15
Go bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-04-27 00:40:38
When the time BTC reached the 21m total coin. what is the next coin all BTC miners will mine?
@_date: 2018-04-19 03:23:24
@_date: 2018-04-25 03:20:18
Then suddenly the price goes hike. "I didn't buy shit!!!."
@_date: 2018-04-11 14:35:16
Maybe they see crypto and bitcoin is a greener pasture and they see this community as a future so they want to be on the trends before its gone
@_date: 2018-04-12 05:37:36
I will ask my son immediately. He has interest in cryptocurrency lately. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 15:55:51
I really like the rollercoaster, referring to the graphs. Great job.
@_date: 2018-04-25 03:05:30
How much? 
@_date: 2018-04-24 01:28:19
Yes! $10k soon!
@_date: 2018-04-24 01:59:28
That's true. We can calm now. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 14:59:27
whew, that's immense.
@_date: 2018-04-17 15:09:11
I hope it will break the wall of 8500. Bitcoin having a hard time to break it
@_date: 2018-04-16 04:16:41
Great news. Source please?
@_date: 2018-04-25 02:52:38
@_date: 2018-04-18 14:56:33
They may need the best legal advisers in this community of course they can afford that
@_date: 2018-04-23 09:27:18
Maybe bitcoins recovers slightly but we are far from moon. maybe if it surpasses the 9 to 9.5 k walls.
@_date: 2018-04-12 15:24:20
*instant selling*
@_date: 2018-04-13 05:53:25
He broke his laptop screen.
@_date: 2018-04-26 13:31:51
this is a new development.maybe nasdaq see the profit in the cryptocurrency
@_date: 2018-04-13 05:48:42
@_date: 2018-04-19 03:13:23
Really Tai lopez? lol
@_date: 2018-04-23 15:16:13
Can you please give us some more detailed info regarding this post
@_date: 2018-04-24 09:46:51
I think banking institutions are feeling the presence of the Digital market and it is making it influence nowadays not only in financial matters but also in the political standing of a country
@_date: 2018-04-24 09:23:57
The best thing about bitcoin is that you can trade it wherever you are and you might gain or sometime you loose but you have the control over it.
@_date: 2018-04-18 03:13:56
@_date: 2018-04-20 14:41:23
9k I think before the end of this month it will surpased the 9 k wall
@_date: 2018-04-27 00:35:00
The demand for bitcoin will increase. then the price will hike. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 00:31:32
Very sad. I hope he'll find his hard drive. and bought his first Lambo. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 21:02:47
I'm in!
@_date: 2018-04-16 06:43:38
That's fine. We'll wait for other answers. Lol
@_date: 2018-04-25 02:45:22
@_date: 2018-04-16 03:56:57
Amazing. Congrats!
@_date: 2018-04-30 14:32:54
wow that is so nice knowing that we can use our bitcoin to buy some products in the online
@_date: 2018-04-17 02:19:51
@_date: 2018-04-17 15:19:09
Yes. It was a pretty good suggestion. We cannot predict what's this market will happen but of course we do hope that it will be bullish
@_date: 2018-04-30 15:22:05
Yes! Recently some European countries are having a agreement in accepting crypto currency in their financial program of their country
@_date: 2018-04-25 21:10:52
For me as well
@_date: 2018-04-27 01:23:08
Go ask your parents to get some BTC for you. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 01:56:23
@_date: 2018-04-12 05:28:31
Very good. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 05:05:53
Stay calm. In the future, everything will be alright okay? 
@_date: 2018-04-16 03:23:18
I hope so. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 00:18:08
Ugh. True!
@_date: 2018-04-16 10:32:16
Wow that's huge for a couple of hours of investment you already gain and of course, you have that kind of leverage to trade
@_date: 2018-04-28 04:37:34
maybe they're doubling there effort
@_date: 2018-04-23 12:54:22
Gold is gold. Even from the ancient times it has retained its value, bitcoin on the other hand is the currency of the future.
@_date: 2018-04-23 13:55:32
This decisions of the Indian court I think is beneficial not only for the bitcoin traders but for the majority of their people having access to this thru internet unlike banking institution which usually for the rich and able people.
@_date: 2018-04-25 21:12:50
This has to be safe, otherwise they wouldn't sell all these ledgers in schiphol. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 01:36:29
Yes, you're able to mine but. it will cost you more than to get profit. because you'll be trying to destroy your laptop. I better suggest do mining on PC. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 10:00:42
What? I hope you are right but still holding it. I hope it will be a big run.
@_date: 2018-04-13 07:22:52
Amazing. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 03:11:17
That's crazy. 
@_date: 2018-04-19 04:25:37
Haha! 
@_date: 2018-04-24 11:00:48
its a bull run now...hope it can sustain it
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:32:19
I think you ask it in a wrong way... Bitcoin is trending right now 
@_date: 2018-04-19 03:16:53
With that amount, he can buy the whole Philippines? 
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:18:54
Maybe a contributory factor with this green zone at the walls right now is the plan of some European countries to put blockhain in their financial system and it boost the trust of the people with the cryptocurrencty
@_date: 2018-04-16 10:07:28
Well said bro in this community we have only 2 types of traders the losing group and the gainers group. It will always this way for this community
@_date: 2018-04-19 02:10:46
Yes sure. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:43:05
btc. at 13 % uprising.. This is a bull run
@_date: 2018-04-22 06:59:13
ha.ha, lol
@_date: 2018-04-24 07:27:38
haha. that's already an old news..Will wait to break the 9.5k walls and then will moon at 10k. this community are very pessimistic to the bullrun of bitcoin
@_date: 2018-04-19 02:58:14
This is awesome! 
@_date: 2018-04-17 02:49:55
Woah. Amazing!
@_date: 2018-04-18 03:45:25
Off your Anti-virus
@_date: 2018-04-21 12:08:52
Thanx for the reply at least you have given me an idea how it works for bitcoin and also for the traders and users. It may help also some curious minds about this
@_date: 2018-04-13 05:49:13
Welcome back bitcoin roller coaster. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 03:50:08
i hope it will break the wall of 9 k and it will be total moonlighting
@_date: 2018-04-18 12:07:12
I think he may want to advertise it more, the more popular it may get, the higher it may take... just saying.
@_date: 2018-04-10 23:56:26
So true! :(
@_date: 2018-04-17 02:35:50
Wow, I hope someday some store in my country will accept bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 21:09:18
I lost my bitcoin, I'm still searching it as well
@_date: 2018-04-17 02:17:12
Cool! I will download this later. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 22:17:49
Haha, that was a hit and run case.
@_date: 2018-04-25 02:37:37
Is it faster too? 
@_date: 2018-04-18 11:44:36
I think he post it because most of the trades got fucked during th recent crashes in the community and just want to have some fun in this thread
@_date: 2018-04-11 03:05:45
Nevermind. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 02:56:16
That's good to hear if true. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 03:00:05
I recommend Delta. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 09:07:23
you're right but eventually it will make its way to the banking institutions. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 21:07:15
Yea I remember
@_date: 2018-04-22 06:50:09
yes and I hope it can sustain it into the moon
@_date: 2018-04-22 04:05:36
I think this post is giving us some important advice of course and we thank you for this and especially for the newbie for this community
@_date: 2018-04-19 06:33:29
Sounds good. so ₱200,417,471,867,586.3895 will be the total price of this country?
@_date: 2018-04-22 06:45:27
I think they are testing the 9 k marked and if they can sustain it. Eventually there next target is the 10k market. Maybe the end of this month they can test a bullrun on that
@_date: 2018-04-16 10:12:37
Everybody here is hoping this stepping up to the price of bitcoin. I hope it can recover, many are waiting for the right time to sell their coins
@_date: 2018-04-26 00:13:58
It's dumping again. see you $6k.
@_date: 2018-04-21 11:53:45
yeah I hope it continues its right track right now. This market gaining supports right now and it is better for this community
@_date: 2018-04-23 12:27:59
yes I agree with you, that's how it works
@_date: 2018-04-23 11:44:27

@_date: 2018-04-23 15:07:32

@_date: 2018-04-11 00:00:26
Can you give me the link? 
@_date: 2018-04-23 12:47:19
I think there is s difference between the store of value and medium of value. they have both characteristics that difficult to compare to its other
@_date: 2018-04-18 03:37:13
I lived in Dubai.
@_date: 2018-04-26 13:48:35
I hope wehnn it break the 9k it must push through up to 10k wall or just even knock at the door maybe.LOL
@_date: 2018-04-19 03:42:46
It's not too late, so buy now. And literally, this is the right time to buy the deep. we'll moon soon. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 06:56:47
yes waiting for a 9k take over and trying another wall of 10 k. I hope it can sustain it
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:28:38
I hope this bull run will break the 7.6k marker looking to be bullish right now
@_date: 2018-04-23 14:50:44
ha.ha. Why are you yelling? You so excited for it's uprising .LOL
@_date: 2018-04-25 21:07:04

@_date: 2018-04-17 01:34:51
Samsung always making a good first move.
@_date: 2018-04-11 00:18:45
Great to see this.
@_date: 2018-04-23 13:47:45

This is the newsmaker of this hour. The Bitcoin flash bull run that within an hour it makes around 12% bull run and after a couple of minutes back to 7.7 Usd. What do you think contribute to this flash pump?
@_date: 2018-04-18 03:38:15
Ok, thanks!
@_date: 2018-04-26 14:20:57
I think right now traders are very careful and analyzing if this is truly the dip or somewhat manipulated buy only as to create some changes in the price of bitcoin but we have the losers and the gainers. hudlers just wait\

Yeah! The one who says he/she knows what is the price tomorrow is a retired ass. they can't accept the truth.
@_date: 2018-04-16 03:36:02
I really wanted to go, to a place like this. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 02:30:00
Ugh. The banks &gt;.&lt;
@_date: 2018-04-10 23:57:35
Which exchanges do you use?
@_date: 2018-04-24 13:48:41
I think this day it will break the 9500 walls and tomorrow it will be the 10k barriers will be the target. Hud'lers your time comes...

@_date: 2018-04-23 09:30:47
wow it is nice to an ads like that. But in Vegas it was only accepted at the hotel and still cannot be use in gambling
@_date: 2018-04-18 11:23:19
Yeah I think It will improve our knowledge how these bitcoins can affect this market in the future if they are included in the market
@_date: 2018-04-11 01:54:29
You're right. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 02:00:41
They use your money.
@_date: 2018-04-18 03:50:47
No one will be gone. Both of them will stay. You know that. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 07:23:53

Truth hurts.
@_date: 2018-04-25 02:40:22
@_date: 2018-04-18 02:51:27
People trust Satoshi because he changed the world!
@_date: 2018-04-23 14:51:53
Yes I think we can yell if it breaks the wall of 10k before the end of the month
@_date: 2018-04-16 15:37:41
If this exchanges will win the decisions of the court I think It will be a game changer not only for the crypto community but might as well with the regulations governing banking industry
@_date: 2018-04-26 00:44:51
Sex for bitcoin. lol
@_date: 2018-04-18 03:38:00
KYC verified is so long process.
@_date: 2018-04-16 10:18:32
Ha.ha.ha. maybe he is referring the hard work being done by whales to pump the price of bitcoin but cannot sustain it to break the wall. I think we need that dragon from the GOT to burn that wall
@_date: 2018-04-22 07:12:26
This is another milestone for bitcoin but why Venezuelan are rushing with it right now?
@_date: 2018-04-18 01:38:22

@_date: 2018-04-25 21:04:47

@_date: 2018-04-25 21:16:29

@_date: 2018-04-17 16:07:00
