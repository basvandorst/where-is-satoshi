dude was probably really stoned when he wrote this. Agree, value of energy converted into value of bitcoins is a far better explanation.

This article is very dangerous.
I can't claim for certain that there was any intention in the creation of this article beyond attracting an audience to generate ad revenue -- but it is so egregious in its reporting that I can't help but wonder if it is propaganda. 
This article is SO bad, and it's publishing website SO without oversight (yet clearly attempting to command some credibility with a name like "International Money") that it was bound to be linked and passed around -- by both Bitcoin believers and skeptics. 
I'm not saying this was done by design, but by being SO bad as to be passed around -- especially by the Bitcoin community -- the article has bubbled up Google search results to the front page of Google News. 
Anyone truly bothered by this article has a duty to keep an eye out for any attempts to use this article as a resource for other articles or even Wikipedia. This is very important. 
For fuck's sake, Steven Wilson is a shithead who sucks.

He's fake! This guy isn't real.
"Editor-in-Chief of a well-known tax publication"? "I contribute regularly to tax blogs for a host of industry-specific websites." 
Although this is incredibly vague and generic -- there is no proof anywhere else on the Internet that this guy exists. 
If you go back and look at every other article about Bitcoin on this website/blog/hoax, you'll find nothing but misinformation and egregious reporting -- there's one article that claims the Winklevoss twins FOUNDED Bitcoin.
