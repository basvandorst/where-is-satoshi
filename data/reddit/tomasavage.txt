I don't know. Its not like you come across a guy with BTC like that everyday lol
@_date: 2017-04-27 19:18:06
Trust what you will
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:05:14
Yeah that is true, and I will track that for sure. Thanks for the advice mate
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:09:13
Yeah, that is true, hence why I am not extremely terrified/worried.
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:56:26
Yes, but it is quite a big deal when there is a major recession
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:04:07
I know. I wasn't talking about the small recession today. My post was simply asking if this is foreshadowing a bigger recession. But yeah, I totally agree.

When did I ever say that I couldn't hold through? I don't know if you guys didn't read my post or are just trying to be rude. I asked for your thoughts on whether or not there might be a bitcoin recession. Obviously you're too stuck up and arrogant to even answer the question. I'll be the one laughing when I'm well-off for being as careful as I am.

I have 19,499 BTC. I certainly hope it does not crash.
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:02:26
Yeah, that's true.
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:54:30
Wasn't freaking out lol, just asking for thoughts
@_date: 2017-05-26 10:51:34
I'm asking what people think will happen. Do you people even read the post? What is wrong with you?
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:54:07
I know, I was just saying, there was a recession from 12pm today to now. I was just asking for people's thoughts.
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:57:05
I mean money value is the only reason I have invested into bitcoin. Also, it is called making a prediction. Sure, no one knows what exactly will happen, but you can make a pretty good educated guess.
