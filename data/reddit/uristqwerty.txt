From a low-level view, the publishers are giving your web browser a list of instructions on how to display a page. It's up to your web browser how, specifically, to interpret those instructions, whether HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. How could a browser interpreting ad  content differently be significantly different than IE6 doing a shitty job of page layout full of quirks and incompatibilities?
Now, how about a browser that explicitly includes a mechanism by which plugins can hook into the page interpretation, and enhance it? That's still working as intended by the browser, it's just a *very* flexible way for users to further configure how content is displayed by the browser engine.
It's like saying you cannot, while reading a novel, imagine one of the characters talking in a Sean Connery voice because that is not how the author intended you to perceive their content.

My opinion is that the difference is that the original format is explicitly designed to pass through a transformation layer before it is presented to the user. I would compare it to audio data, where different headphones might be designed with very different frequency responses. Some headphones might really focus on a strong bass response, others might not even produce audible signals from the lowest frequencies. Would listening with a pair of headphones that has an integrated tunable band-stop filter, configured to cut out the ranges dominated by the oboe alter a work in a way that infringes copyright? Could listening to music with cheap earbuds be declared illegal because they do not adequately reproduce the sound intended by the content creator?
