Based on this, I would recommend you to read or listen "The Bitcoin Standard" by Saifedean Ammous.
Is a masterpiece, he is an economist, you can also watch his book introduction in Vienna:

How do you know your wealth is going to be protected if there is not enough adoption and Bitcoin continues to be an speculative asset? In my mind, the only thing that can make Bitcoin less volatile is mass adoption.

But you need to buy food, you need to pay your bills, you need to buy clothes, etc., We all understand the logic between savings and spending, and behind time preference, but again, you need to consume your basic stuffs to live, those are the things I mentioned, if nobody wants to spend Bitcoin because everybody is holding, then how would mass adoption occur? I'm just tired of the people that only see Bitcoin as a commodity and not as a currency..., In my mind, only as a commodity will never reach its true potential.

Thank you very much!

This was a good experiment, thank you all. All you want to become rich with Bitcoin, but none of you would help with mass adoption, all you care is about how you use the current fiat system in your benefit until the next recession arrives...
It's funny the people that talked about credit cards, maybe the same way some people may have talked about cheap mortgages prior to 2008... Or people that bought Bitcoin at 19K with a 24% interest credit card.
You don't want Bitcoin the currency, you want Bitcoin the gold-like.
My final conclusion is that none of you would use Lightning Network to buy anything.
Thank you.

lol good point, but I think the intention of my question is not difficult to figure out.
