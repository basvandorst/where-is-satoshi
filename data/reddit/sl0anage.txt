Good paper, but are you posting it ironically? I doubt botnets are capable of driving out the power of modern mining equipment, but then again I'm no botnet expert.

What might happen if the government got control of a mining server like BTCGuild?

Ah, that's the answer I was looking for: Where/if they found the PKs. Thanks! Any link to prove they found the PKs? I'd be interested in reading.

Right, that I understand, it's part of what makes the whole system work and maintain security. I just haven't read anywhere how they obtained the private keys at the time of seizure. seems to believe a bigger sentencing was avoided through disclosure of private keys and I was hoping you knew for sure if that was the case?
