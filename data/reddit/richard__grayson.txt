It appears that the gentleman did not store his private keys in a secure manner.
@_date: 2019-07-16 20:12:47
Well since we have gone so long without touching, I think we are gonna drop all the way to the 200 MA (weekly), so that’s where my buy orders are at.
@_date: 2019-07-16 21:51:06
 [ 
Here is the 50, 200 MA (weekly). So the 200 MA is at about $7.2k; that's where I think we are headed.

No it won’t. I think we will see the bottom around July 26th.
Edit: that’s when a big futures contract closers I think.
@_date: 2019-07-16 22:36:43
I found out the problem. I am talking about the MA, you were talking about the EMA

You don’t just let someone off for doing something morally egregious because other people have gotten off; they should all be locked up for a very long time.
@_date: 2019-07-16 13:23:50
I got really lucky and sold at $13k. I make &lt; 10 trades a year, so I just aim for the big  40%+ movements. I think we are going to $7180, so that’s where my buy order is at.
@_date: 2019-07-17 14:07:14
Wtf is this shit lmao
@_date: 2019-07-16 21:53:02
 [ 
Here is the 50, 200 MA (Daily). As you can see, the 200 MA is at like $8k

200 MA (Weekly) I think.
@_date: 2019-07-16 02:03:20
Awww fiddlesticks; I better buy back in before it's too late!
Edit: jk I think I'm still right, but was just off a couple hundred dollars on the lower high that we would form
@_date: 2019-07-16 14:32:52
At the start of every bull run three things occur. We cross the 200 MA, the 50 MA crosses the 200 MA, and then we bounce off the 200 MA. We haven't bounced off the 200 MA yet, so I am still waiting for that to happen.
@_date: 2019-07-22 18:03:53
Try only making 3-4 trades a year to accumulate more BTC. People frown on TA, but macro trends are pretty easy to spot.
@_date: 2019-07-03 15:55:46
Viewing Bitcoin as merely a currency is extremely short-sighted. Bitcoin is literally the internet of money; you can program it to be a lot more than just a currency.
@_date: 2019-07-16 20:28:19
Can you elaborate? I just checked the trading view; The 200 MA (weekly) is at almost $6k

Hey, I only cried about Tron for 20 minutes.
@_date: 2019-07-03 16:53:11
Yeah, it serves as an unchangeable, unforgeable public record. So anything like birth certificates, social security numbers, government issued IDs, marriage certificates, college diplomas, highschool diplomas, certifications, medical licenses, criminal records, financial history (I think I’ve made my point). Also worth noting is the transparency it can offer. For example a politician can accept all of their campaign contributions via the blockchain, so everyone is aware of who their donors are.
Edit: to be clear, I mean you can store this information on the blockchain.

A vanity address is the BTC equivalent of a custom license plate. The guy had to repeatedly create BTC addresses in order to get this particular address. In other words, he flipped a coin A LOT of times until he got the sequence of results he wanted.

If you turn off the internet, is it still easy to use the bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-10-15 17:15:58
This is an excellent property of the bitcoin. You can fund the development of massive infrastructure without having anybody to fill the demand right away. For example, they can build this wind farm in the middle of nowhere and then build an energy infrastructure big enough to support a decent sized city and then use all of that power to temporarily run the bitcoin network while they wait for people to move into the city.
@_date: 2019-08-15 13:18:11
You could have said the same thing about the internet. “There’s no way the internet could support real-time video conferencing with 10+ people, it’s way too slow for that”. “There’s no way mass adoption of the internet could occur, so many non-tech people have a hard time using it”. Give it like 10 years, and bitcoin will be as necessary and user friendly as the internet.
@_date: 2019-10-17 17:38:27
There is an inherent problem with your calculation that bitcoin is only a currency. For reference, this is like saying that the internet is only email, and then trying to calculate the size of it based on how many books, newspapers, written letters there are in the world. 
Bitcoin is so much more than just a currency; it’s a decentralized form of trust, it’s a public record, it’s the internet of money. There are services that have not even been invented yet that will run on the bitcoin network. The value of the network is almost impossible to guesstimate at this point.

The 200 MA is at around $5500; that's where I think we are headed.
@_date: 2019-06-24 15:48:24
Perhaps we should focus on adoption and technology milestones.
@_date: 2019-06-04 20:02:07

What if you are between the age of 10 and 25?
@_date: 2019-09-07 22:58:28


No it's not. There are plenty of indicators that rely on mathematical formulas (for example the ichimoku cloud and Williams' fractals) and output some sort of objective metric. If you think that this is subjective, then a lot of science is simply subjective in your opinion. Cigarettes cause cancer? That's subjective because they relied on a t-test to tell them if their results are statistically significant, and that is a completely subjective metric.


I would like you to provide some evidence for this.


This is just flat-out a misrepresentation of TA, and gives the impression that you don't actually know how to do TA. Furthermore, I presume you believe that  meteorology and weather prediction is a legitimate field of science, and that too relies on historical data to make predictions about the future.
Let me close by describing what I think TA is in an effort to enlighten those who seem to have a negative view towards it. TA is basically a series of litmus tests and pattern recognition that you use to give you an idea of what is going on. I have NEVER heard/trusted anyone who says they know for sure what is going to happen just like I would be suspicious if the weatherman came on the news and said they knew it was going to rain tomorrow. Just like the weather, TA will give you a sort of % chance of rain. Any honest person who uses TA will tell you that they do not know what will happen tomorrow, but they can tell you that there are dark clouds up ahead and to be ready in case a storm hits.

Okay so according to you, dollars are both an investment and not an investment at the same time, depending on if the person sees them as an investment or not.
@_date: 2018-04-12 07:03:49
So you’re saying that I couldn’t have invested my dollars in GBP in anticipation of the brexit, because dollars aren’t an investment and therefore cannot generate any return by buying (or in my case selling) them
@_date: 2018-04-12 08:29:46
the definition of investment is:
 **the action or process of investing money for profit or material result.
"a debate over private investment in road-building"**
you can invest USD into GBP or vice versa for profit, which makes them both an investment by the definition; You are wrong.

We still haven’t touched back down onto the 200 since crossing it; this is something that pretty much always has to happen at the start of a bull run. Set your buy orders at $4650 and be patient.
@_date: 2019-05-17 22:37:18
Ffs it’s going to $4600; This happens every time we begin a bull market.
@_date: 2018-12-05 05:46:39
Wait until it crashes to $1890; you’ll be think otherwise then.

I tried to warn people to hodl their horses in (this comment)[ but I was met with a lot of hostility. So, we are probably gonna go to $4600. I provide evidence for this in my linked comment, but a summary is we have to bounce off the 200 MA (which is sitting at around $4600 rn) to consummate the bull market.

I accumulate BTC almost hourly rather than buying all at once. I find this to be the best, most fun and also the least stressful way to invest.
