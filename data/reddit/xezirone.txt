I think there is no differ between news , if you don't like any news article you can ignore it and don't read it, all news most be published regardless of everything and everybody's opinion , News is News , That's just your opinions and always it's best to keep your dumbass opinions to yourself

It's not a good reason that news articles must not be published just because you don't like , News events happen all around us although you like or not and always it's a good thing to share news with others however maybe someone doesn't like and i don't think i must publish only news articles that you like , if You Don't Like it Just Don't Read it
