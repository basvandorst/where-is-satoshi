It's a private dedicated server, based at a datacenter.

I'll take a crack at this, am I eligible?

How exactly are they planning on regulating an *anonymous* currency, that *cannot* be easily tracked unless the user allows it? That's like trying to regulate where a bird can and cannot crap.

Bitcoin was based on the mining of 'gold', including the difficulty, rarity and

Really? Wow! I thought that bitcoin was already at a not personally mineable stage - Would you suggest buying some BTC for the ride?

Nice. I can see the community really is welcoming!

Wow, you are an asshole. Someone is trying to raise money for a charity that affects everyone is some shape or form, and you had to go 'fuck altcoins'? Shame on you.

Dying? I think not. With a growing market cap, hashrate and transaction volume, we're far from dying. You are a vile, disgusting person. For someone who only cares about whether we're shoving money in your pockets, you are a narrow minded twat. 
There shall be no further discussion on the matter.

Someone give this guy gold.

Lol, almost every single thing there is wrong.

So I'm guessing you walk around with every bit of fiat you have taped to your back? No. Don't do the same with Bitcoin. Just like there are ways to keep your fiat money safe, there are many with Bitcoin. And how can re-using passwords lose Bitcoin?

How does one obtain an image ad?

I'll run a full node on a i7 machine with 10 GB ram, and a 500gb hdd, helped by a 60mbps connection in the uk for 0.5 BTC per year ;)

Yes, but why would I waste 30 seconds per page click when I could just install Adblock and be done with it?

And how would you be hoping to pay for items? With PayPal accepting Bitcoin in the near future, that's greater than 50% of online purchases that could be paid for with Bitcoin. What we don't have we will gain, one way or another.

May I ask what you believe is 'Real' when it comes to money? I can go out and buy many things with crypto, as well as many other currencies, if that's what makes it real. 
@_date: 2015-04-13 22:37:50
I've had an idea like this for about a year, and have been quietly developing code for it. As a dev, you utter *tw&amp;t*, but as a crypto-enthusiast, well done.
