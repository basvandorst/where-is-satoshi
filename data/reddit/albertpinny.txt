OTOH,  there are tons of Bitcoin accepting web hosts nowadays... Being the Linux of money could still be considered a great success. (And think how much Linux is used behind the scenes without users being aware of it!)

And the post you were commenting on was talking about validating nodes. You pulled out a quote about miners. Nobody disagrees there are good reasons to have a lot of miners.
If you think there are economic incentives/game theory around validating nodes then quoting something widely accepted about miners doesn't really help.

By that logic, your and others great amount of "concern" about this implies that you do believe Bitcoin has indeed never worked in the first place.
I fully agree with the sentiment, though. What would happen if some rogue actor deployed some % of mining power and some amount of nodes with different rules? Not much? But, of course you're not afraid of that happening. What you are afraid of, is actual democracy, where the users and miners get to choose the future of Bitcoin, and do so with a clear majority, without a cabal of core devs being in ultimate control.
You spew FUD against Gavin and co, perhaps some of it even warranted, yet you also do nothing to placate the actual users. You stick your fingers in your ears and try not to hear the people clamouring for a stop gap solution to Bitcoin scaling.
You want to keep Bitcoin as your political project, while failing to realise that the actual design of Bitcoin means you do not have that level of control. The design of Bitcoin says majority wins, and the losers get to cry about it.
And if that causes problems or some failure of Bitcoin, then yes, Bitcoin has never worked in the first place.
Can a distributed majority overrule the small number of core developers? A contentious hard fork will be the first true test of Bitcoin's promise.

Can anyone recommend a good/cheap VPS provider for running a full node? (Bonus for supporting bitcoin, obviously.)

Oh, if only he hadn't used the word "governed" everything would have gone down fine.

Nodes in that context means miners, not validating nodes.
