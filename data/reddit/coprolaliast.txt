You are being forced to use their currency but they don't want you to have any of it.

but it was this *inflation* you were trying to get away from wasn't it? That unbridled printing of fiat currency? Or is it more about  the anonymity and security for you?
There can only be some many of each *coin, but there can be an infinite nr of *coins leading us to the same misery we're in now.
Whenever more money is needed we just start another *coin?

Hi B-C,
For the novices among us, including myself..can you please address why there needs to be any other *coin than Bitcoin? Isn't the essence of Bitcoin good enough? 
Most people like it that there will every only be 21 million (slowly disappearing) bitcoins and that they can't be printed at will.
That said, what worries me is that there can be an infinite nr of *coins which has the same inflating effect. exactly what bitcoin tried to solve?
Are you not the Ralph Nader to the Democratic party? So... not to be rude, but shouldn't *coin, including litecon just 'go away'?

Forking is 'inflation' these cryptocurrencies so desperately try to avoid

We need separation of money and state.

very good question... I think they are LOST...

And you are right! Certainly it is a liquidity issue... but it triggers people looking for other means of paying.
In my view Money and State should be separated.
Just because my government is trouble, I can not get access to my money?
