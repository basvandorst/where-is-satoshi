I wouldn't put your faith in any 1 person, the community will decide Gox's fate. It takes a long time to build trust, but can be lost in an instant.
Gox has failed too many times, and more efficient and more professional exchanges have left them behind. Gox may not die today or tomorrow, but IMO, they'll never recover to anything like a 30% share of the market

The questions been asked several times recently. In a nutshell, the trend of recent positive news (Buitpay, Circle, Bitcoin2014, etc), and a lack of negative news. There appears to be a growing belief that the next rally may be just beginning. I'm not suggesting this, just alluding to other posts

The difference here is that bitcoin isn't s business it's an open source protocol. What threatens the network is quickly fixed.

Being part state-owned means nothing to the banks. They are not accountable to the public, and likely never will be, even the government have hands-off approach, which was echoed by Gordon Browns light-touch approach relating to regulation.
Early on after the UK bail-outs it was suggested UK tax-payers could received payments from profits made by these part-state owned banks. This didn't, and won't happen and is never discussed any more, yet the bankers get their bonuses for screwing over taxpayers.
If anyone had any delusions over the collusion between government/political/judicial/large corporations in the western world, then events over the past 6 years have shown them in their true colours.

It's not about accepting bitcoin, it's the realisation that it will generate extra sales for them and improve their bottom line with lower fees, plus the average BTC user, spends more per purchase.
You say Andressen will never see the kind of growth, yet he says they will invest hundreds of millions of dollars in the next few years? I know whom I'd rather believe.
Agree about Litecoin and Doge, and they are on par, or even ahead of BTC in their perspective timelines, though we'll disagree as I see both as secondary cryptos, that will piggyback though not surpass BTC as the No 1.
@_date: 2014-05-16 14:30:56

I wouldn't say that entry doors are the most important piece of the puzzle. BTC without doubt is in it's infancy, hence 0.9x release, and will not realise it's full potential for a decade, perhaps longer.
The real significance of Bitcoin though the distributed ledger has no real significant utilisation commercially as yet, and remittances to the developing world are, in the most opportunistic view, in their infancy. Mircropayments are an ideal somewhere in the future, with smart contracts et al, further down the line. All in all, we're on the first lap of a 10,000 metre race.
I have no concerns over the long-term price so long as the protocol remains unbreached, and development continues apace. I've not devoted time and effort towards BTC for short-term gains, and remain positive for the longer-term.
As Warren Buffet once said: 'Our favourite holding period is forever'.
I plan not to covert my BTC, but to spend when use is ubiquitous.

No one can say with certainty when the best time to invest is. As always, due your own independant research, as Bitcoin is volatile and can rise/fall 10% or more in a single day with no warning. If you're in for the longer haul, you should make gains, though there's no guarantees. Only invest what you're prepared to lose.

I don't know if UK banking is best in Europe but a payment from one UK bank to another is normally processed within an hour, but try sending money from one branch to another of the same bank, and this can take 24 hours

Incorrect. Price has been lower than this so not everyone.
Also many don't buy for short term gains, instead looking for the longer term potential.
You are looking at one period only, what about those who invested 2 years ago, 3 years, 4 or even 5?
@_date: 2014-08-21 11:21:46
Interesting read. I'm not in the least surprised by the difficulty you've experienced to date.
I do see a time when UK banks will embrace BTC, though not likely in the near future.
I've just read another article about Amagi Metals, encountering similiar banking issues, and they are banking with at least two institutions to minimise processing issues should one fall through.

Of course, everyone is not losing their mind, but a significant or sustained price drop for several days or more will shake some of the weaker hands.

Depends on your situation. If you need the money now, cash some in, if not, it's likely to appreciate further over time, due to it's deflationary nature, and increasing adoption.
Either way, I'd suggest at least holding on to some of your coins for the future.

Your final paragraph is correct as of today, but eventually Bitcoin is likely to become stable, and not experience the volatility of today, then it can be a way to send payment without fearing volatility.
@_date: 2014-03-30 11:36:49
You may or may not be right on this, time will tell.
It certainly won't be 'easy' to overtake BTC, to think otherwise is foolhardy and naive.
However, I don't see BTC being seriously challenged in the next 12 months and the infrastructure and buy-in during that time is likely to be huge.
Which crypto's do you see as surpassing BTC, and why?
Just as other cryptos can possibly use BTC's structure, it's a 2-way street, and BTC will likely be able to adopt new features to many of the existing alts out there now. As an example, BTC and Litecoin devs have been sharing ideas for some time.
@_date: 2014-05-25 13:55:21

Safer, for now agreed, though this will change in time for 2 reasons:
1. Gold, and other precious metals will be mined off planet in the future so will not be limited by Earth's reserves
2. Over the next 5 years when Cryptos gain mainstream adoption (and they will gain mainstream adoption, that much is generally accepted, whether that's BTC or another is still to be decided), volatility will stabilise and will become an excellent store of value

Whilst I agree with what you're saying, I find it hard to believe that as a foundation, they have not scrutinised the candidates before allowing the voting process. After all, this isn't the first time this has happened. As a foundation that interfaces at national and state level, they have to be completely clean to avoid the nonsense that is happening right now. Clearly they are not. So the questions that raises are 1) Are they the right people to lead the foundation? 2) If yes, why aren't they carrying out these checks? 3) Why aren't they engaging the community more and resolving these issues more quickly?

While there are centralised governements there will always be corruption. Period. People have always been, and will always remain, corruptible given the right set of opportunities/situation.

When you try to withdraw there is a relatively high barrier on withdrawing, which means it will take months to reach it, unless you have hundreds/thousands of referrals, plus their fees to withdraw will wipe out most of your gains.

(Reuters) - The U.S. derivatives regulator is studying whether it should regulate electronic currencies such as bitcoin, its chief said on Tuesday, as regulators across the globe start taking the emerging technology more seriously.
"We are looking into that," Mark Wetjen, acting chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, told journalists after giving a speech at an industry conference. "It's been initiated, there's been an internal discussion at the staff level."
Bitcoin, the best-known virtual currency, has been promoted by many enthusiasts because of the way it operates outside government control. But recent incidents, such as the failure of Mt. Gox, a Tokyo-based exchange that filed for bankruptcy after losing an estimated $650 million worth of customer bitcoins, have brought the currency under a new level of scrutiny by regulators.
Unlike conventional money, bitcoin is generated by computers and is independent of control, or any backing, by a government or a central bank - something that makes it vulnerable to mishaps.
Wetjen said the CFTC, which regulates swaps and futures, has broad authority to counter manipulation of commodity markets, and it is studying whether bitcoin falls under those rules.
"I think people (in the agency) believe there's a pretty good argument that it would fit that definition," Wetjen said.
He added, "Then there's a separate question about whether or not there is some derivative contract based on, or denominated in a virtual currency and whether that's listed on an exchange. ... There's some looking into that question too."
Wetjen said he could not say what would come out of the internal deliberations or give a timeframe.
Separately on Tuesday, New York state's top financial services regulator, Benjamin Lawsky, said he wanted prospective virtual currency exchange operators to submit formal applications, a first step toward eventual regulation.
And the brokerage industry's own watchdog, FINRA, warned that bitcoin can expose people to significant losses, fraud and theft, and the lure of a potential quick profit should not blind investors to the virtual currency's significant risks.

“Adoption of bitcoin is becoming more commonplace, and we feel it is relevant to our industry and to our users,” Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer told CoinDesk. Don’t be at all surprised if Yahoo soon goes even bigger on bitcoin—whether by acquiring a bitcoin startup or some other announcement—as part of Mayer’s ongoing effort to make the stalling search giant more hip.

Ghash is not centralised. It is made up of individuals who have a choice. Of course I realise the impact of a 51% attack, and do not want that, or want a centralised Bitcoin.
But a centralised Bitcoin is much more than miners/pools. Think entry points, Foundation, merchants, protocol, devs, etc. This would be a centralised Bitcoin.

Word of mouth is a strong force to increase adoption, and I do actively speak with friends, local businesses, work colleagues with limited success.
Right now it seems there's too much FUD which is hampering increased adoption. The entrenched networks are very hard to overcome and will only come with time.

I think you'll find the Euro will be here for many years to come. Sure there are protest votes all over Europe, not surprising given the financial mess our politicians have led us to.
That said, they are entrenched, and it won't change any time soon. Crypto use will rise, but unlikely to overhaul any sizeable nation, or block such as Europe for a long time, if ever.

If two developers can fork Bitcoin and succeed in redefining what "Bitcoin" is, in the face of widespread technical criticism and through the use of populist tactics, then I will have no choice but to declare Bitcoin a failed project.

Diversification should always be the key, and like other posters have said here, if one of the assets you own is at, or near all-time highs, then it's the time to sell. Nothing goes up forever.
Would suggest at least splitting your assets into 4, and holding no more than 25% in any one asset. Only an opinion, but it should stop you losing your shirt.

Good read.
For Bitcoin to be classed as one of the twenty-one examples that will have far-reaching effects on global commerce and international relations for me is an amazing admission by the World Economic Forum.
Irrespective of the future price, there is a growing realisation that Bitcoin is here to stay, cannot be stopped and will become a true global force in the next 10 or so years.

Instant messaging app Telegram is introducing its 50 million users to bitcoin with the integration of its new bitcoin wallet: Telebit.
Telegram’s messaging service is similar to Whatspp, an app sold to Facebook for $19 billion in 2014. Part of the app’s appeal is that it offers better security and privacy than other messaging apps. It also features an open API and protocol. With the app’s focus on privacy and security, Telegram and bitcoin make a perfect pair.
Telebit will allow bitcoins to be exchanged through external bitcoin addresses as well as with other Telegram users.
