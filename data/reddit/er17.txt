Why it amaze you freind ? people follow the green .
All the markets are pretty red for 2016, except our presious Bit...

Bitcoin is going to do 50-700% in 2016! Let the public know!
If the public will know it ... Bitcoin actually will do it faster. Give the public an easy way to invest in Bitcoin and billions of dollars will be invested in. Give the public an easy way to buy and sell with Bitcoin, and a zillion people will use it. Happy new year to everyone.

OK - good to know. But.... 50-100 times larger - is not an easy thing. Zero fees is great, But do'nt the Chinese rules and determine the price of the Bitcoin ?

All major markets around the world collapsed, Bitcoin remains in place. It is a sign of great strength.

Do not forget that an earthquake of magnitude 7% + 7% occurred in China. The whole world feels it.
Where do you think all that money flee out of the stock exchanges in China (when they will be open tomorrow) will go?
To Bitcoin !!!
And that's a lot of money ... for a cute little Bitcoin ....
I raised my take profit to .... 700 :-)

Heyyyyy :-0 How did you translate all the Chinese forum ?
@_date: 2016-01-02 10:10:30
Can'nt google translate do a good translation ?
Can'nt 1 (out of 1.3 billion) Chinee make an on going translation ?
Can'nt reddit make cooperation with them ?
I belive Huobi&amp;OKCoin determine the Bitcoin price .
Their forums must not be ignored.
