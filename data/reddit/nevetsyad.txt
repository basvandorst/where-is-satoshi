American here, can we attack Iran and their ally, Russia to help make this happen?

Wait for Iran to pop-off.

Venezuela with its 14,000% inflation?

True. Take out cell phones and you take out BTC. But there always dial up? If you take down all network connectivity, someone could set up a low bandwidth satellite link and a hotspot off of it. Places used to do the same for credit card transactions before the internet.

Not when your country's currency is fluctuating wildly. Hence using a stable currency like BTC/USD.

Or, you know, cell phones, homes and cars can have Starlink access/hotspots.

Finally THE WORLD will have another alternative to whatever local crap company is overpricing internet access to that region. Also, boats, remote locations, etc. will all have coverage, speedy, low latency coverage.

These satellites are in low Earth orbit. Something like a little over 200 miles up. Line of sight with nothing in the way, it won't take much to reach an object at that distance. Most people don't attempt this, because your satellite moves too fast at that height, you only get a few minutes of coverage for an area, then you lose LOS. Also, the satellite will degrade in orbit and burn up after only a couple of years at this hight. Luckily, Elon has reusable rockets and can launch 60 satellites at a time, using his oldest rockets that don't fetch much on the open market. A storm of fast moving satellites will bring coverage to every part of the Earth at all times, even at crazy LEO.

Yup, not saying it's happening tomorrow. Just listing what the future will likely be.
