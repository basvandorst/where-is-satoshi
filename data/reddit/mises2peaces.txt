Sorry, I was unclear. What I was hoping for is a money over time aspect. So if I need it right away, the program works just fine because it will maximize my money for as fast as possible. But maybe I'm leaving for a couple hours. I don't necessarily need the fastest speed my money can buy. So the program looks at the available seeds and their prices and opts to spend less in exchange for slower speeds which it has calculated will probably be fast enough for the user specified time frame.

In a way it corresponds to the economic incentives between buying and renting. Someone who rents has little incentive to make improvements and usually will do whatever they feel they can get away with. An owner, on the other hand, has an incentive to treat their property with care and even improve upon it. 
It's not totally applicable. But kinda.

Very cool project. I echo some others here that some automation would be cool. Maybe an option for "download in 10 minutes or less" combined with "spend no more than X". Then it spends whatever you've allocated in an attempt to get the file in whatever amount of time you've specified.

You can absolutely have smart contracts without drm. A contract that holds funds in escrow and then pays out to a seller upon digital receipt of goods is a smart contract. No drm. 
Also, in the context of the conversation, people were talking about drm as currently implemented. Many people consider it too restrictive, but that is adjustable.

If companies do something I don't like, I go to their competition. The only exceptions are the highly regulated industries. Regulation doesn't stop the bad companies from operating. It entrenches them by creating a barrier to compete. 
I can't start a small bank that just serves a few people with integrity because the big banks wrote the legislation - which the government wants - to keep me from competing. And I can't afford as many lawyers as wells Fargo.

@_date: 2016-11-01 17:00:39
Right. Almost anything is legal for a transaction, including bitcoin. Don't need a law for that. 
What the legal tender law means is that if there's a dispute over payment, I can be forced to accept payment in bitcoin, even if I contracted to be paid in something else. 
@_date: 2016-11-14 01:21:00
Bitcoin does use encryption for the integrity of the transactions, not privacy. He was listing things bitcoin can do, not describing one comprehensive thing. It could more clearly be restated as, "Taxation becomes difficult because bitcoin is encrypted, and, with certain precautions, accounts can't be tracked or traced to the holder."

They're at least the slightest bit incompetent. Otherwise I wouldn't have been locked out of my account for a month with no response from their CS. Have you tried their support ticket system? It's infuriating.
You submit a ticket. They send an email that someone is working on the issue. Then, a couple days later, they send another email that they're closing your ticket but you can respond to the email if you still need help. If you respond you get an automated message that the email address you just responded to is never checked. They recommend submitting a ticket.

@_date: 2016-10-26 00:45:59
"legal tender" gets thrown around a lot as interchangeable with the word "money". It's not. It has a specific legal definition which involves government enforcement. Just because someone accepts payment in bottle caps doesn't mean they're legal tender. 
@_date: 2016-10-31 14:31:11
Your definition is incorrect. If I contract to be paid in litecoin, the courts can compell me to accept legal tender, ie bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-10-30 12:47:59
There's that phrase again. Why does this community want authoritarian laws like legal tender enforcement? Isn't it enough to simply codify that bitcoin *can* be used to satisfy debts? Not that it must be accepted? 
@_date: 2016-10-30 15:10:30
If it must be accepted, that's authority. The state says I must accept it as payment for debt. 
That's how the federal government forced greenbacks on the states. I want bitcoin to be legal. But I don't want to be forced to accept it. That's too far. For example, what if I contract to be paid in litecoin? Well I might have to accept bitcoin anyways if we end up in court.

Make sure you include a transaction fee.  Some exchanges require that you do this manually - some do not offer it.  Typically, sending btc is done within 5 -10 minutes if you send even .001 with the transfer.

Transcription for people on mobile or the lazy:
"This is related to the thread Bitcoin and VAT in the EU but I think that it deserves its own thread. About a year ago I requested an advance ruling from Skatterättsnämnden (“the tax board”?) in Sweden regarding Bitcoin and VAT. An advance ruling in this case means that their decision is legally binding for the tax agency in Sweden (“Skatteverket”) and a general administrative court (“allmän förvaltningsdomstol”) if the applicant wants to use it. The case that I presented was that I would be buying bitcoins from an exchange (e.g. Mt.Gox) and then sell them on to Swedish customers. Last week I finally received their decision and it was good news!
First of all, they state that exchanging between regular currency and Bitcoin does not imply consumtion, i.e. Bitcoin is not treated as a good or a service, so there is no VAT on bitcoins themselves. With regards to VAT it is treated as any other currency.
Second of all, they reach the decision that the service that I provide is also excempt from VAT, i.e. there should be no VAT added to the commission that I would take.
I have written about this in Swedish on bitcoin.se with some quotes from the ruling but it is hard for me to translate the legal stuff to english. I only have it on paper right now but the ruling will be public on the homepage of Skatträttsnämnden, hopefully later this week."

Is this not in direct contradiction with the white paper?  According to the paper, "Normally there will be either a single input from a larger previous transaction or multiple inputs combining smaller amounts, and at most two outputs: one for the payment, and one returning the change, if any, back to the sender."  (page 5, section 9)

No argument here, but I should elaborate. I did explain to people around me the merits of bitcoin, but at a certain point no answer was good enough. They understood the basics and that it wasn't necessarily a scam. They just figured that since it was new and strange that it was likely to fail due to non-adoption.

So I think that's what Jeffrey Tucker meant by that, not that every user will read the code. It's sort of like when Guttenberg invented the printing press. It didn't mean everyone suddenly knew how to read or actually read the bible. But it meant that a lot more people could examine what the society was based on.

I'm not sure what that's called or if it even has a name. Regardless, the phrase "market capitalization" is an industry term which refers to the total value of issued stock in a publicly traded corporation. 
Personally, I don't care what anyone calls the total value of all Bitcoins in circulation. I'm just pointing out that nobody should be surprised when they get corrected by people in the financial industry for using the term incorrectly. It only seems like users in r/investment are being pedantic to people who learned the incorrect usage of the phrase. It would be like if some came to r/bitcoin and said that "mining" means when the bitcoin corporation releases newly minted coins from its digital vault.

It isn't a gain when you factor in the opportunity cost of simply buying the 10btc outright. But it is still a net increase on wealth. I was arguing against the proposition that mining will always result in a net loss. It's simply untrue. A miner will make less profit in my example, not a loss.

First of all, the black market you're referring to is mostly drugs.  I have no problem with that.  And if these people you speak of are afraid of drug money, they should ditch their fiat currencies.  Second, anyone who thinks that bitcoin is only used for drugs has clearly done zero research into the matter.  Is the purpose of government to pass legislation to ease the wrongly placed fears of the ignorant?

Both and more.
Within the community there is a term known as getting "Goxxed".  It refers to trying to execute a trade but being unable to because the exchange service is non-responsive.  It happened so frequently with Mt Gox, the former king of trading engines, that the term was coined.  It may sound trivial, but a lot of people lost huge on missed trading opportunities and that bitter experience still lingers in the community.  
There is also an element of crypto-anarchist &amp; cypher-punk philosophy, at least among a sizable portion of the community, though not all.  The relevant part of that philosophy is to build systems with no central weakness which might be exploited by a would-be aggressor.

This is wrong. Measuring in absolute values is not helpful when the relative value changes so much. If, for example, someone bought 10btc worth of mining gear and mined only 8btc, that is an absolute loss of 2btc. But if the value of bitcoin doubles, it is a relative gain of 6btc. Said another way, it is a 160% return on investment. 
Edit : It seems I was very unclear. OP said mining is unprofitable, which can mean one of two things. I was arguing against the proposition that a miner will necessarily incur a loss, not that mining would make more money than simply holding the coins. The profit comes from the increased value of the coins, which the mining decreases but **does not eliminate ** in my example. There is still a profit.

I'm sure that we both want the same end result here.  I'm not arguing for a system where fraud and corruption is the norm.  I'm arguing that state regulation doesn't prevent it and tends to make those problems worse.
I'm not saying everyone is an angel.  In fact, that's my very point.  Those people who want to do bad things will flock to the institution which makes the rules.  And that's what we've seen with currency controls and banking regulations all throughout history.  There is a misconception that banking is under regulated today.  In fact, it is among the most heavily regulated industries, next to arms and energy.  My argument is that we would actually see less predation if we didn't have corrupt institutions making the rules for the rest of us.
Just look at the current regulations facing bitcoin.  In the US, for example, exchanges are being harassed and closed because they don't meet the money transmitter regulations.  This type of barrier to entry is precisely the kind of thing that big banks want to limit their competition.
If you could point to a specific concern that you have, it would be easier for me to address.  If your interested in this sort of thing, I would also like to recommend the book *What Has the Government Done to Our Money* by Rothbard.
