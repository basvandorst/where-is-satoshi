Internet didn't have competitors that had those problems solved, bitcoin does.

Yes there are handful of cryptos that actually have unique use, but large majority are just trying to become mainstream currency.

But all those goods you listed are bought because people believe they are worth that amount or believe the companies will grow to be worth that amount. On the other hand for BTC it feels like a lot of demand comes from people that are only buying because they believe there will be someone in the future that will pay even more for the coins they bought and not because they believe the coin itself is worth anything.

The problem is that 99% of bitcoin demand is created by investors wanting to get rich and maybe 1% by people that actually use btc to buy goods. This can't be good right? If the price of btc stabilises we would be left with only 1% of the previous demand for the coin.

When money comes easy you don't care as much when you lose it. If he invested years ago and just made 100x his initial investment by basically doing nothing why would going back to 60x really hurt that much. It's like all those stories about people that win lottery and just spend all the winnings in a couple of years.

They were definetly lucky. Seeing that blockchain has future was savvy. Thinking that this one use for it that can be easily copied and exact same or better copies made easily will get huge not so much.
Even if we ignore that part, the way that bitcoin gained value wasn't the way those savvy people thought. People thought that btc as currency might become mainstream and therefore drive price to the moon, but that is not the case. The use of btc in the past few years hasn't increased by anything close to what the price has increased.

But the price of Bitcoin right now is entirely based on speculations. It seems like most people are buying the coin for $15k because they believe someone else will buy it from them later for $20k not because they think it's actually worth that amount. If bitcoin becomes stable, and it has to for it to be a viable currency, all those investors will leave, and those investors make up at least 90% of Bitcoin demand. What will happen to Bitcoin price when it's demand will decrease by &gt;90%? 
Because of this it seems to me a crash is inevitable. I would love to hear a counterargument to this.

It's only messy if done by people. I would have though there are bunch of bots doing thousands of those type of trades a minute.

Do you really think those nerds didn't sell most of their coins when the price jumped from 10c a coin to $10? Or investors that bough those coins at $10 didn't sell them when the price jumped to $50?
