You might as well go to Guido down the street. Why do you want to find an illegitimate exchange? You are asking to be ripped off with that mentality and only draw attention that you want to pursue illegal activities. That's not what Bitcoin is about. It is about beating the system within the system. Throughout history Caesar has always collected his share. Nothing will ever change that unless we have complete anarchy. And Bitcoin won't help if that occurs.

Actually if they are smart they will accumulate and store BTC as a store of value to back their crypto currency. They could trade with their citizens BTC w the new crypto to start accumulating. If they ever provide political freedom and find decency they will have a crypto currency that is backed by a world store of value currency (BTC) for international trade.

Oranges are oranges and Bitcoin is Bitcoin. No one owns the creation of either of these. However many sell them Tropicana juice and the cboe orange futures market. There is no infringement here. Gemini is a registered exchange allowed to exchange Bitcoin and now they are registered to mediate Bitcoin  futures on the cboe. You too can start up a company, get it registered, get the licensed knowledge you need and be a clearing house for oranges or Bitcoin.

Each single contract may be bundle to represent 100 Bitcoin so the actual end game is 100x so in the example with the X+ 9 the difference being 4 it is actually 4x100=400. (Different commodities are grouped in different numbers and some markets have what is called mini's) those are for the smaller players but get them into the game.   Why would someone do this? For every person that thinks a glass is half full there is one that thinks it is half empty.  For each contract there is a buyer and a seller. To the winner the spoils.

Having (proving you have) an established FDIC insured brick and mortar bank account that you wire 'some' funds from assists in verifying your true identity. This significantly reduces the odds you are laundering funds when you do other transactions like you want to do I assume. Such as sending Bitcoin to your Gemini account from another wallet or any type transaction.

The contract you buy is a contract to buy bitcoin at a certain value in the 'future'.  If the value of bitcoin is X today and you buy (spend non refundable fee to buy it) a contract in a future date (say 30 days from now) and the contract strike price is X+5 if after 30 days the value of bitcoin is only x+3 your contract expires and you are out of the money. You lose your contract fee. If after 30 days the value of bitcoin is X + 9 then you are in the money that difference of 4. Tomorrows lesson is who is selling this option.

Yes and when everyone on the planet is rich with Bitcoin then food, and roads and bridges will just appear. No one will have to work. Everything will just be given to us all because we are rich. There is a reason, law of nature that put people in a economic class. Depending on what decisions and how hard you choose to work will drop you down or raise you up. Bitcoin will not replace the human races basic need for ladders of success and failure. Sorry, it is what it is.

I don't give a shit about monetary creation in this regard.

Not when you are trying to unload it. Supply and demand.  In your example they(drugs) are products that are hard to get and the seller takes risks selling it so there is a premium and the price goes up. In the Bitcoin scenario Bitcoin is hard to unload (exchanges cutoff) so the buyer takes on the burden to have to exchange it 'somewhere'.  The buyer assuming that risk of being stuck with it will not pay full market value for BTC. That will push the price down.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:29:20

Futures pricing is based on current value of Bitcoin not the reverse. However, depending on what futures are doing may impact the thought process of buyers and sellers. Hence there is a relationship both ways but fundamentally they are separate of themselves.

Futures market provide a valid hedging utility/ purpose. It is when the speculation that comes in can things get whacky. I agree w that until the dust settles over the next month or so. My plan. Hunker down. Do nothing, especially not sell, if we hit significant dips I may cost average buy some more. I believe there are so many small buyers out there to battle any major future sell attempts thus keeping it from a big dive. The first month though it could be insane. Get a case of beer settle in for the Holidays and let this all just play out. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:43:56
Which is normal way of doing this for this type of commodity. Nothing to see here. Move along. 
Pricing will be based on Gemini Bitcoin auction on daily basis and adjusted accordingly.  Go out and do the research yourself on the cboe website and Gemini's and don't establish your thought or position on a single post or two. Not even mine even though I'm a humble genius.

Futures contracts are bundle as a general rule in groups of 100. When you buy a contract you will make ( or lose ) 100 times the difference of the price of Bitcoin and the strike price of the contract. There is also a bit of gamblers blood in futures whether it's pork bellies, oranges or soon to be BTC.

Absolutely, but not in a speculative manner. They will calculate their cost of doing business make sure there is fair profit and by contracts to protect their position Bitcoin may fall below that minimum profit level.

You need to be able to document that you did not receive goods or services in the transfer. If you did it would be considered a sale of the commodity (Bitcoin). If you moved it from your left pocket (Gemini) to your right pocket (Ledger) then it is not a sale. Just maintain those records for documentation. Report those transactions where you received fiat, goods or services. They are taxable.

Since there is no real delivery of a truckload of oranges, pork bellies, what ever there is no underlying support that price expectations are made from.

Ok, thanks for the advice.  By the way look up the words finite and infinite. BTC is a finite supply while fiat is theoretically an infinite supply.  Hence your dribble about satoshi's is well known by all. None of what you typed has anything to do w the discussion so no need for me to continue w you. However feel free to respond if that makes you think it will impress someone. And by the way. Supply and demand will cause inflationary pressure on the price of goods and their associated cost in BTC.

Then they are taking turns losing money to each other. Whale 'A' buys at 5000 and it goes to 10000. Whale 'A' sells to Whale 'B' at 10k and it goes down to 5k after 5 mos.  Whale 'B' then takes a loss and sells it to Whale 'C'(or back to 'A')? 
Why would Whale 'B' take the loss?  
That's why I believe slowly but surely it is good for whales to sell off over time.

If the government states that US banks cannot send or receive funds with any exchange that is known to deal in Bitcoin then how would that not impact my investment.  Not a challenge.

Agreed but if the price stays around $7500 or lower you will see a percentage, not all, go off line until it goes back up to about $8k or so.  If this is a temporary drop miners will hang in there.

You can track what is in the wallet without ever popping the private key. Hence you load .25 BTC on 4 of them. You can hand 1 or whatever of the physical devices over without popping the PK. The bal can be validated w/ out popping the key. So in theory or in practice you can hand 2 non popped Opendimes that have .25 BTC on them (in this example) and pay someone .5 BTC for something. They can then pop them and send the coin elsewhere or hold on and hand off to the next physical transaction. A lot of flexibility here. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 22:16:41
Remember the original calculation is in penny's. You need to convert the penny's to dollars. 
How many penny's is a bit coin worth today? $4725 X 100 = 472500 penny's (I rounded off earlier for ease of math). Divide 472500 / 1,000,000 Satoshi =          .4725 penny's. 
Good conversation. Math gets confusing. 
Edit: Since learned Satoshi is 100,000,000 and not 1,000,000. That was the error of my ways. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 16:06:28
I don't have a price target since we are still in the speculative phase of crypto (bitcoin).  I have not seen evidence (wish I would) that the driving force to date in BTC price is other than speculation. I am not aware of any purchase transaction to date being based solely on the good faith of BTC in value and existence. All transactions are based on the local fiat currency and the cost of that cup is based on the fiat price divided into current moment value of BTC. Hence the inflation relationship. I don't see the future trigger that will take us off that relationship. In theory the sky is the limit for BTC via speculation but I do not see the science to support a fundamental value/price to stand on its own.

Retrenchment does not occur in 1  - 24hr period. It will go up and further down each swing until a good bottom is firmed up. After that it should start its ascension to new highs.

Not being negative. Point is if we have a serious inflationary period as referenced earlier in the thread that effect is going to have a direct impact on the cost of the  'proverbial cup of coffee' As such a million US dollar value Bitcoin will be no where near the purchasing power I think some people believe it would be under today's standards.

Not being argumentative here. Just open discussion. Unless you are talking about peripheral value (decentralization, no gov ownership, etc.) What is the 'value' to Bitcoin now?  At least Oracle and Amazon have a book value based on property, investments, etc. And they have albeit ridiculous PE ratios that provide some value. So what monetary value does Bitcoin have right now besides speculation? Hey I am an older guy that has 45 yrs of working for 'the man' so I want BTC to make it. Fortunate for me if it does get up there a little ways that is all I need for icing on the retirement cake. But a 1mil BTC would not bother me. My dream won't cloud my logic now though.

ShapeShift worked fine for me doing the split last weekend. Toughest part was getting the private key out of the copay wallet since it does not display private key without going through (understandable) gyrations.  ShapeShift itself worked fine. Just move the BTC first using private key prior to BCH conversion since in theory the first transaction leaves the private key vulnerable for the remaining coin type left. At that point do the transfer through ShapeShift of the BCH to BTC new wallet and and you are on your way safely to wealth and wisdom.

Item 1 is a show stopper to me. But that's just me. Modifying Bitcoin to validate altcoin existence in no way is beneficial to Bitcoin in the long run. It in fact brings Bitcoin into the same category as the altcoins thus opening the door for a different altcoin to become the new coin of choice. My thought is focus on Bitcoin alone, make it the best crypto currency w needed functionality and there won't be a need for others to use their altcoins. Allowing for item 1 rewards the altcoins for breaking off.

If it is sitting in your bank deposit box as a HW device how is your private key going to be stolen? It won't. You can also track the amount on the opendime via a watch wallet which Is what I do. And you can add funds to it without having to pull it out of the bank box. Pretty good really.

Unless it goes down to 5$ and you could have sold it at 500$ now or even better 850$ when I did and bought Bitcoin and then made more off of that. Otherwise sure it's a win/win. And your supporting a direct attack against Bitcoin by keeping BCC viable. But it's a win/win.

You don't have to physically hold the opendime to have btc sent to it. It can be sitting in your local  bank vault.
@_date: 2017-08-16 12:24:02
The above scenario is a use case I do not use my open dime for. Whether it can or can't be done would not impact me.
I purchased my own opendimes. Directly from manufacturer. Not nor never will use these for direct commerce. I load them. And store away. When time comes I will create the private key that is based solely on the coin and actual device code. Load appropriate funding needed for 'x' amount of time to spend as needed to another wallet for this purpose and then quite possibly split up the balance remaining on the original opendime in portions to other unused  opendimes purchased directly from the manufacturer. As for the used, empty open dime. All funds are removed and it makes a good key chain that generates conversation.

Not arguing. I am a Hodler. Besides speculation what is the demand based on?  I don't see anyone in a situation now that says if I don't get Bitcoin I am not going to be able to eat. I do see people saying if I don't have money/USD/Pesos/dinar I am not going to be able to eat. May be close in Venezuela so I will throw that out there. But I think they are at the hoarding stage to protect from their garbage currency but not the exchange for services phase (buying/selling of goods) with BTC.  So I think demand is speculative and not underlying commerce factor which is what we want to drive the price. Either way, if it goes up I am not going to complain. However speculative increases tend to have more intense drops than increases based on commerce/economic factors.

It is the five stages of dying or grief. Not stages of denial. Denial is part of it. 
The five stages of dying are denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance are a part of the framework that makes up our learning to live with the one we lost or ourselves if dying. They are tools to help us frame and identify what we may be feeling during the process. (Reference Helen Kubler-Ross)

Unlimited value until you turn the transaction into a significant deposit of fiat currency in your bank account or a Lamborghini type object appears in your driveway.  As long as governments exist and they always will they will be a partner or you will eventually pay the penalty for trying to block them out.  Caesar will get his due.  The only way this will be successful is if eventually there is the capability for small day to day transactions.  And Segwit with the layers coming hopefully will do that.  That is the time Bitcoin will establish 'good faith' value in my opinion.

I understand your point. Our difference is that I think Bcash is doing every thing it can to stay at the overpriced level it is now and will slowly go down to be just another 4 or 5 usd altcoin with no distinguishing usage.  It bubbled out at around 1000, I got out at 850 and it is struggling to stay where it is at now. It will slowly lose that battle and go down to a level w the rest of the junkyard coins.

Like a chain is only as strong as the weakest link I understand the channel path is only as large as the lowest channel in the path. That begs the question if a particular channel has xx BTC and previous transaction came through it for x amount BTC does that reduce the original (xx) channel to x until it is cleared back to the blockchain. I would like a good source to learn of how that is handled or hear what the visionaries see will be the path forward. Go BTC Go!! and Lightning too!!

Fact: People not familiar w Bitcoin think they can't afford it because they don't have '$4000.00' to buy one. No potential newbies know you can buy a portion of a Bitcoin.

A 'contract' is an agreement between two parties where each party provides the other a product or service.  It is against the law and unenforceable for a minor to enter into a contract. The other party has no recourse and has potential liability if they enter into the agreement/contract w a minor. Hence any business, in this case bank/exchange is not legally allowed to let you open an account.

Spot on. To make the jump from more then a bartering commodity like gold to actual currency the world would have to go through such a anarchy phase that the ones in power and wealth will be those that have physical commodities that provide food and shelter materials and the means to protect them from raiders. 
A store of value and commodity exchange is what we want as the end game for BTC or its value will be zilch.  The jump from commodity to full currency is a bridge to far and the only error (not fatal) in the Bitcoin concept.

In my opinion the combined value of both regardless if one or the other is significantly higher than the other, the combined value of both will be less than the BTC price today due to the confusion and risk of the future validity of crypto currency and the s2x strategy to centralize the control of it.  It undermines the vision, purpose and security of crypto currency. People like me will dump both if half of what appears to be a possible result occurs.  Not a happy message but trying to be forthright. Start the down votes now......

US legitimate exchanges such as Coinbase and Gemini have safe guards built in (may be mandatory to be licensed and insured) to finalize the transaction to prevent potential fraud, money laundering etc. 5 days is probably a self imposed number to account for weekends etc, time for bank transfers/confirmations.  With Gemini, you have use of these funds or BTC during the cooling off period as long as the transaction is not a w/drawal off the platform. Hope that helps. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:25:41
It is not a stock it is a store of value that you can transact or save off of. Like a savings account you can put $20 or $20000 into it. You will gain (or lose) at the same rate at either level. A snapshot value of 1 BTC is just a baseline amount to go off of for our individual investment.

When this is all done because of mind thought like yours each coin will have a combined value of 4000 at best. This will be a cluster if it goes through and tools like you are blindly, in good intent, playing into the altcoin disrupters intent. Peace.

Cool. Did you buy more of each or holding splits? (Don't answer). If you bought more, hmm. If sitting on the split I understand wanting them to go up. But it distracts from BTC. Both alt coin functionality could be done on 2nd tier off BTC w out diluting BTC which is what the authors of the alt coins wanted. They were greedy and did not want to wait for the safe, natural progression for BTC to expand.

No, too many Alts and shit coins are playing w the Bitcoin name to lure newbies to them instead of the true crypto currency BTC - Bitcoin.  But agreed we need a term for smaller Bitcoin denomination.

You need to take off your pocket protectors and get a life or at least understand the real world politically.

China needs N Korea as a tool so they had no choice but to adhere to Trumps warning. China announced it cut off all bank ties w N Korea for the time being simultaneously w Trump announcing the US will cut all ties w any companies in the world that deal w N Korea. Rare move of agreement between China and US.

IMO the only true devalue risk to BTC is if it continues to be considered a set it and forget it 'investment' and not readily used like fiat currency. Another coin will surpass usage of BTC in this scenario since it will be used as a trading for goods 'currency'. BTC will go the way of Pokemon and Baseball trading cards. Sooner or later the majority of items that are just held for later riches end up losing their value since they were part of a fad and not a true 'utility' for usage.

Up until the last sentence or 2 I agree. My concern on the latter is it come across the regardless of damage done to the long term  health of Bitcoin. Profit over 'the cause'. Self over decentralization. I am not looking for profit with this attack. And will accept loss if needed. I am looking to support the original intent of Bitcoin and its purpose.

Good info. My motive is to do what I can to defeat 2x so if that is full node I need to pursue that. I dont want to wait for 2x to start their attack. I want to attack first. I figure the best way is my own node and only dealing w Segwit configured transactions (for lack of a better term) now. Why should we wait if we can signal only Segwit now? Attack them before they are locked and loaded per se.

The banning doesn't mean they need to stop it it just means they need to find you using it.

Agreed. Absolutely on Gemini. The problem w Bitmex is since it is not registered in all states they are vulnerable to a raid in doing illegal transactions and their customers are vulnerable to them lose their funds as such because they are doing this in states not licensed.  Gemini, except for the 5 states they are working on is a safe spot. But to be clear. I am not talking about 'trading' my world is BTC only and I can keep what I want on Gemini and get in and out of BTC as I want w risk funds. I offload my HODL funds to a nano s.

Most understand that Coinbase is part of the attack on BTC in order to gain more control over it by changing the 'rules' of BTC and trying to keep the name. Instead of declaring it an altcoin which it is. Two different coins with the same name / mining process.

US gov determines for one reason or the other Bitcoin is not allowed (pick any reason). Make it illegal to convert BTC to dollars. Banks will be shut down if they do not abide by new reg. Money launderers / exchanges thrown in jail/shutdown. BTC cut off from US dollar as a result. Goodbye BTC.

The issue is that to avoid money laundering for illegal activities some delay in deposit is a necessary evil. However, with Gemini you can send $500 max a day and when doing the transaction immediately purchase BTC. You will need to wait 4-5 business days for the cash to clear to move to HW wallet but if you think about it you were just able to purchase BTC immediately and your cash has yet to be received by Gemini. If you follow the rules of investing the $500 dollar a day limit is good to protect you from yourself for rash emotional quick decisions. You can however send $500 today, tomorrow, next day, etc if you want the capability to pull the trigger on a full load at one time. So what may take a few days to setup the funding level you want to start at you are good to go after that. Keep some cash there and then cost average your buys (a good investment strategy).  Get a ledger HW wallet. Set it up for Segwit only for BTC and offload your BTC as soon as cash transfer hold is removed if there is one due to timing of cash deposit and BTC purchase. Hope that makes sense. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 09:49:00
The fact you are willing to stick with them because they might still handle BTC and not just S2x means you don't understand the risk / threat that Coinbase is to BTC. Dump Coinbase and find a legitimate BTC supporting exchange.  Lots of options. Gemini for one has worked great for me.

Inflation is based on supply and demand principles. There are basically 4 aspects that can impact 'inflation'. The referenced article provides good info. Of the 4 pts the first one involves monetary impact and is where BYC comes into play. Since there is a cap on the eventual total number of coins that will be produced it eliminates the first concern of inflation. Hope the article helps:

@_date: 2019-09-29 11:18:07
Supply and demand cause inflation or lack there of. The store of value or currency type is not relevant.  No inflation is a one misnomer of Bitcoin. Example. 1 loaf of bread available at x bitcoin price. Two people want it. One person wants it more than the the other and pays x+ Bitcoin price. There is your inflation. Reverse now. 10 loaves of bread available at x Bitcoin price by 3 different stores. Two people want one loaf each but won't pay x Bitcoin price. One store lowers price x- Bitcoin price to sell the bread. Hence deflation. Whether it is Bitcoin, $$ or EC is not relevant. I understand adding to the money supply by printing more may/most likely devalues a currency so prices appear to go up. However the underlying reason is supply and demand not the limited or excess amount of the base currency/btc.

Yep. Just like the thinkers on the Titanic said. Who cares if we hit an iceberg this ship can't sink. W each Bitcoin (not all altcoins) attacks like S2x if the alt would win there is a good reason to believe that 'Bitcoin' days are numbered because the attack succeeded. Your assumption that the collapse of the original Bitcoin automatically results in the success of the attacking coin is flawed. I for example would walk away if the protection, decentralization, and many other reasons the attacking groups do not support should they win. I know the coin could not survive in the long term. Something else would replace it all together. Enter world banks. Great opening for them. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 11:51:13
Correction is an incorrect term. Should not be used unless minimum 5% but really 10% drop in value. Or really what is out o the norm of the item being traded and its normal volatility. BTC actually has a normal volatility of 15% so this being the norm it would not be a correction.  What you should say is will the bottom of the current trading range be higher then the last cycle. In other words a higher low than  the last sell off cycle and then will a higher high occur after that to maintain the upward trend.  This is not a correction. It is a normal trading range cycle.

Since you mentioned me. Good question. At the present time it is not a real threat to the US economy and its financial system. Nor is it for the foreseeable future. As long as it is based on the value of the US dollar comparatively, the US dollar is not a risk. Hence the gov is OK. Think about it. No one says 'great BTC is XXX value so I can buy a car'. What people say is 'great BTC is worth XXX US dollars and I can buy a car with that amount' Even if they buy the car with BTC they still based it on the US dollar equivalent. It will not be in our lifetimes (even if you are age 2) that BTC will stand on its own as a independent value. If it does we probably have bigger problems then our BTC balances. Don't throw stones now because I said that last point. BTC can still rocket in price due to supply and demand over our lifetimes. Hope that helps.

Shitcash. Wrong thread. Should be on altcoin thread.

Prez Trump and republicans were able to get a new tax structure through that is going to make filing taxes a lot easier and reduce the amount of taxes most people pay. A lot of deductions from income were removed however a single or married auto deduction was doubled. This makes the tax submission much easier for most tax filers. There is no need to 'itemize' since it will be less for most people then the basic deduction (12/24k). Hence if there are taxable gains on Bitcoin it would be good to file the gains under 2017 so you can itemize all the cost/expenses against the income to reduce the tax liability on the gains.

Yes, because us Hodlers are not gambling at all with this whole crypto currency stuff. Hmmm.

Maybe you should post this where it belongs and not in the Bitcoin thread.

The problem is if one uses the true 'blockchain' then you cannot separate Bitcoin. If one wants a variance of modifying Blockchain structure/process the discussion belongs in a different thread discussing Blockchain modifications based on user stories.

1929, 2008 and 2018. Years of financial disaster for many.

I would not put much hope in eliminating greased palms. Be it dollars, pesos or bitcoin if there are humans involved bribes will always be part of the game. Be it in fiat or crypto form.

No problem in US with banks when using legitimate/licensed exchanges.

Set it and forget it. Look at it in ten years.

That works but 10 years will be even better :)

It seems like only a year ago I bought BTC at 17k. How time flies.
