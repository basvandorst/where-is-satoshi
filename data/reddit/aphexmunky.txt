I see a clear gap in gaining certifications while satoshi was very active. I'll let you draw your own conclusions

It was just regex for the dates from  and grepping the dates from the git log. I then imported the results to google docs. No scripts to speak of sorry. Looking through my history this might help for the commits.

What's your password security like? 2FA protects access to downloading the encrypted wallet from blockchain. Maybe they tried to login to blockchain, seen you had two factor auth. Then went to somewhere you have a backup of the wallet like an email account or dropbox. They could then access the private keys by decrypting the wallet. In any regard the funds are gone.

I've just tried this and can confirm it works. The shop attendants were quite confused for a while but eventually figured it out.

The only issue they had was realising my Gmail client had put the attachment barcode at the end of the email and wasnt displaying it as part of the cotent. After they noticed it they were able to scan ok

Do I win something for being first?

No cex as in the second hand electronics shop. They've rolled out bitcoin support to a lot of shops now and the website supports it too.
If you want do buy new online I personally use pock.io to exchange for amazon vouchers. You specify the amount and its sent to you after an hour or so. The voucher once applied to Amazon has an expiry date of about 15 years.

To be fair, core are doing a fine enough job of destroying bitcoins reputation anyway

You don't specify your technical ability so i'll simplify to how I might explain it to my nan.
Unfortunately, to understand mining you need some computing knowledge.
There exists something in computing, something known as a hash function. This is simply a way of reliably turning data into a number in a way that the number is both difficult to predict and unlikely to favour certain numbers over others. The point being that given an exact piece of data you always get the same number, but if the data changes in the slightest bit, the number changes massively.
Since this number is hard to predict, you might need to change your data slightly to get the number you want. In the case of mining, the data is mostly a list of transactions that the miner has checked are valid and they're trying to find a low number.
Now, the numbers we're talking about are *extremely* large. Your computer could run for years trying different combinations and still not find the data that creates this number. BUT, if someone told you the data you could easily and quickly check that it's correct.
That's what mining is. Computers racing to find this number before others and once they find it, they send it out to others and they quickly check it's correct.
What mining does for us, is secure the transactions. Miners check that transactions are valid, so one thing they check is that you haven't already spent the coins you're trying to spend. If you have already spent them, they wont be included in their data. You can't lie about having already spent them because the list of transactions everyone takes as the true reflection has that hard to find number associated with it.
