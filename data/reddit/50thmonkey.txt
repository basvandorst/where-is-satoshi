Oh come on now, Bitcoin with whatever size blocks will never be as much of a sideshow as debt-based fiat money. Can't we at least all agree on that?
@_date: 2017-03-28 22:16:47
thanks for your reply!


Any numbers to throw out here? Doesn't have to be right, just your best guess.


ha! good suggestion for the next poll :)
@_date: 2017-03-31 08:27:58


Most interesting bit. Love hearing about my failures - only way to learn.
How do you see its value?


Because if this ever is not the case, one of its main selling points wrt. other currencies will cease to be. This will cause it to cease being adopted, and the price to fall. Nobody invested in the system wants to see this happen.
It should be pointed out that this is *not* the same as being able to verify it on your home computer by yourself though. Its also not ever going to need a whole 10 meg datacenter (or two of them - ahem, VISA). In fact, even at VISA scale, validating the whole chain will likely take less that 1/2 a rack of servers - well within the price range for any medium business (and there are a lot of those that would use bitcoin if we hit that scale).


SUCH DISAGREE. This may be the most interesting aspect to you (I know as a engineer its also very high on my list), but (and since we're talking about failures of imagination) not being able to see how some of the monetary properties are more interesting to some people, or censorship resistance, or transaction speed and low cost, or investment growth potential, or even the *possibility* of independent validation (minus the doing it personally part) could be valued by other members of the community more than *personally* validating is a pretty big blind spot, wouldn't you say? Or did you mean to say that independent validation *in general* is the thing that enables those other bits, hence a keystone in making bitcoin interesting - because I wouldn't necessarily disagree with that statement (among other things, its also quite important).
@_date: 2017-03-30 16:07:13


How exactly have I done this, I'd like to know.
@_date: 2017-03-30 04:03:33
the wider point I'm trying to make here, that has been made in many other forms, is that the 1MB block size limit is just not a headline recognizable feature of "big B" Bitcoin
the 21M cap is - everybody learns about that
coins not being stolen is - critical feature
no double spending - critical feature
1MB limit? What TF is that?
edit: added more newlines for readability
@_date: 2017-03-28 22:47:56
how likely, in your opinion, is such an attack, and what effects would you say it had on Bitcoin's security?
(honest question)

I'm a fan of this use case myself. Everyone could use sound money :)
@_date: 2017-03-30 02:35:49
Just wondering, how would you rate these consensus rules by importance?
* 21M coin limit
* miner reward schedule
* who gets the transaction fees
* no double spends
* no coin stealing
* PoW algorithm
* block rate
* block size
@_date: 2017-03-21 21:56:36


If its a full hour, I'm ignoring your block and orphaning you, which means you lost money. If that's not in the code already, and this *really* does become a problem, that's like a 25 line fix in any implementation.


Is this an honest concern of yours? Really? What's your honest estimate for the cost/benefit of this attack?
@_date: 2017-03-28 22:14:50
how would you estimate it? (Honest question)
@_date: 2017-03-30 02:20:25
A very balanced approach IMO - thanks!
@_date: 2017-03-22 00:04:16
I'd love to see your design for a block that mysteriously causes certain miners to take 900x longer to confirm than others
@_date: 2017-03-30 01:41:16


That's just the thing - the reason a hard fork for larger blocks has so much support from miners and users is because they think all that "thinking" isn't rational at all, and that indeed, hard forks are safe.
Are you aware that bitcoin has indeed hard forked safely in the past?
@_date: 2017-03-20 22:13:15
Your adversarial case hypothetical increases the chances that the attacking miner's blocks are orphaned (they still have to be relayed to be built upon). Orphaned blocks suck and cost money, there is no incentive to do this.


In those 5 minutes one of two things is going to happen:
1) the network, busy figuring out if your block is valid, is still mining on the last block and will orphan you if they solve before they validate yours, or
2) the network is going to SPV mine on your block based off the header assuming the validation will catch up.
(probably some combination of both, actually)
This leads directly to these consequences:
In case 1) you loose money by increasing your chances of getting orphaned (hey, an *actual* fee market based off *real* costs, funny eh?), so no incentive to do this, and
case 2) you gain nothing if your block was honest (block header is the same size/latency no matter what size the block is), and you eventually get orphaned if your block was dishonest, in which case you loose, so no incentive to do this
If your next argument is "they'll build on their solutions in secret without broadcasting them!", congratulations you've just described selfish mining, which is no different from how the network works today.
Any *actual* reasons to oppose this to offer us?
@_date: 2017-03-29 17:28:52


I assume you mean for full nodes, yes? Good to keep in mind, for sure.
What effect do you see this having on the security of Bitcoin? (any numbers you care to throw out for increased likelihood of successful attack?)
@_date: 2017-03-28 22:19:45
its not easy, no. Any educated guesses?
If someone were to say "we'd lose 99.7% of the nodes within 7 days" or "we'd end up with 50,000 nodes due to increased adoption" does your gut/numbers check with that?
@_date: 2017-03-30 16:16:44
the exact same way they're talking about doing now
USAF, sell off, convincing exchanges not to take their coins, etc etc.
Consider that if miners jammed a rule into bitcoin that hurt its value, they would lose more than anybody else because they can't exit the system
@_date: 2017-03-31 18:22:53


Thanks for all of the personal insults. FYI this is not a good way to show the strength of an argument - it tends to have the opposite effect.


I'm not talking about a well connected node - I'm talking about a node that keeps an upload ratio of 2.0. You are aware that the network, much like a bit torrent swarm, only needs an *average* upload ratio of 1.0, right?


The solution above is 5U... that's ~1/10th of a rack


I said $3,500 over 7.5 years, and $2,000 a year in hard drives - that comes out to less than $250/mo, where did you get "a couple thousand" from? Can you at least read what I wrote before jumping on it?


I'm fairly certain this will happen also, because in practice nobody will need to do otherwise because in practice, virtually no fraud will happen. Should, in practice, fraud happen regularly, I would expect more nodes to come online to check for it.
What I've shown is that even at the *biggest scale* most people talk about (i.e. VISA level), you will never lose the *ability* to verify all transactions should you wish to. Can't afford $250/mo? Go in with 5 friends on a shared node. That's less than a cellphone bill. Don't have 5 friends? Can't help you there... sorry.


Trust me friend, buy and hold at least 1 BTC. If we're going to VISA scale, it'll likely be worth $1M by the time we reach it. This is a great way to offset the cost of your node if you're ever worried about it.


There's a problem, I find a solution. Its what "actual engineers" do all the time. I like the "throw one GPU at it" better, personally, but I haven't taken the time to code that up yet.


I've yet to see one.
@_date: 2017-03-30 06:11:56


This is *not* an engineering point. This is a social sciences point. If this is the real reason to oppose larger blocks, we should not be listening to developers about their opinions on the matter any more than anybody else (which is a lot for an engineer like me to say).
Also, if you think the community wouldn't rally 100% behind an *actual* attack that threatened one of the *actually important* consensus rules, you're sadly mistaken.
No EC supporter is going to turn around after the block size upgrade and say "well shit, that was easy, now lets get rid of the 21M cap" or some such foolishness, because *exactly nobody* would support that.

how do you estimate it?
@_date: 2017-03-30 01:43:07
I think it might be prudent to point out that if the split happens at 75% per the plan, its likely the only people mining the minority chain would be BTCC and Bitfury, both of them very close to 50%
Not sure that's much better
@_date: 2017-03-28 22:36:19
very clear picture, thanks! Sounds like you might consider not running a full archiving node at 32MB?
What's your fat finger estimate on how 32MB might impact the security of the network? (is it 1% less secure? 50% less secure?)
@_date: 2017-03-30 04:32:07
Am I hearing you correctly that, to you, having 1MB blocks and not 2MB blocks is more important than keeping bitcoin safe from double spends, theft, *and* inflation?

@_date: 2017-03-21 10:15:50


Can you elaborate? Its not immediately obvious to me this is possible.


Doing this implies giving up an entire block reward to slow down the SPV miners by however long it takes to confirm your block is invalid. This is like paying someone $20 for a $1 bill.
@_date: 2017-03-30 17:01:36


You're right - some of those rules listed were redundant. They're not the best way to describe the consensus system.
Anything else?


This is exactly why the slippery-slope arguments about "one change to break them all" don't convince me.

With all respect to you and Nick, I'm both a pilot *and* an engineer, and fully capable of reasoning about the proper functioning of systems thank you very much.

@_date: 2017-03-22 18:49:21


There we go. Yes, agreed. If one pool is running their full node on a raspberry pi (exaggeration to make a point), their blocks will confirm slower. This is not news. Its also how precisely zero pools run their nodes.


This betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of how miners relay solved blocks to each other. I suggest you read about FIBRE: 
@_date: 2017-03-30 01:17:04


If I were to sum it up, you'd say any departure from this is likely to negatively impact the network (primarily because of the quadratic sigops problem)?
@_date: 2017-03-28 19:02:07
thanks for stopping by!


How do you see these economics playing out were BTC to switch to 32MB blocks?
@_date: 2017-03-29 23:19:58
That's a good point - if BU activates, and miners choose to do this instead of moving the chain forward, we may need to diversify from bitcoin in 2140.
I'll remind my heirs to look out for this.
@_date: 2017-03-30 05:56:05


Are we worried about hitting some "engineering reality" wall that appears at exactly 1,000,001 bytes?


I don't actually disagree with this point in theory, but practice is an entirely different animal. Take 2MB blocks for instance - care to put some numbers on how many nodes CPUs you think will fry trying to validate 2MB blocks instead of 1MB? How about 32MB?
@_date: 2017-03-31 01:08:08


Which 3 exactly?
You know, you've been nothing but incredibly rude in this whole exchange, in a completely unwarranted way. I get that you disagree with me on the block size issue, that's fine, you're entitled to your opinions. But I'm a human being as well as a bitcoiner, as well as the other things I've mentioned, you ought to consider that.
@_date: 2017-03-31 06:34:35


you're talking about banks and the Fed my friend, those you can't audit
This disagreement IMO is not about possible vs. impossible, in bitcoin it will *always* be possible to audit miners' blocks, and it will *always* be possible to cheaply transmit and verify a proof that a block is invalid. In that regard, bitcoin will always be better than other money systems no matter how big the blocks are (okay, maybe not practical at 1TB/block, but I highly doubt we'll get there in the next 16 years. Feel free to come back to me and point this out if we do).
The disagreement is about how much should it cost to *personally* verify every transaction in every block on a computer you yourself own, should we never figure out a way to incentivize that service separately from mining (which, in itself, assumes mining is not incentive enough - debatable).
Should we be trying to minimize that cost at all costs? Or can we perhaps take a slight increase in that cost to let bitcoin accept more users.
I know there's lots of banks and financial institutions out there that would love to see bitcoin remain this fringe little thing on the internet that never grows up to threaten them with its radically lower costs to verify transactions. Maybe we shouldn't piss them off?
@_date: 2017-03-30 01:14:28


caught me :)


This may be true on a block-by-block basis, but never forget when crafting attack scenarios that all the rewards are denominated in bitcoin: no matter what, the strongest incentive a rational miner has is to make the value of that bitcoin go up. If an attack scenario would decrease the value of bitcoin, its interesting but ultimately already disincentivized by virtue of mining ASICs being useless for anything other than bitcoin mining.
@_date: 2017-03-30 01:45:32
Please remember that miners are paid a fixed number of bitcoin, so their strongest incentive by far is to do whatever increases the value of the bitcoin vs. fiat
@_date: 2017-03-22 03:18:49


Okay, lets start with 4x then. How exactly would you design a block that takes certain miners 4 times longer to confirm than other miners?

I saw:


and then:


And I was like, aren't those contradictory? But I see you corrected yourself:


Which I can now see the logic of.
We can shrink that incentive though - either by:
1) writing into the client a way to signal which transactions you're working on to other miners (hard to coordinate, but not impossible), or
2) tuning the client to shorten the window between when notice of a block is received and when it's proven valid (requires pre-validating broadcast transactions, then ticking them off when the block surfaces), or
3) clearing most of the transaction backlog (as measured by fee value) with every block so there's not 
so much money left on the table by a zero-length block (requires bigger blocks)

Yes. Is this a bad thing?
@_date: 2017-03-30 16:18:49

@_date: 2017-03-29 17:34:45
Thanks for the answer!
Any predictions to offer on what 32MB blocks would do to the overall security of the network? (or 8MB?)
@_date: 2017-03-30 04:09:42


I don't know how many investors you talk to, but this is a common theme I'm hearing these days and not for the reasons you state. Concern is that if bitcoin doesn't kick out a certain dev cartel and show meaningful willingness to scale to attract new users, its growth will suffer in favor of the alts.
Have you considered that BitMain might actually want what's best for the network?
@_date: 2017-03-31 10:24:35


YES! SUCH AGREE!


Oh, you're losing me there. If transactions go to zero, so does value - so there's *some* relationship there. Also many people have their money in assuming bitcoin will grow to larger transaction volumes (which will require more money in). If bitcoin stops growing, that money may well go where it *can* find growth. That's just prudent investing.


I think the slippery slope argument here is unconvincing - have you even listened to the guy?


VISA did 100 billion transactions [in 2015]( or 3168 tps average
At ~450 bytes per (your average 2 input-2 output transaction) that's 45TB per year of new blocks. This fits on 8x 6TB drives.
You can fit 7.5 years worth of those drives in [one 4U box]( 
The box will cost you $3,500, and the drives $2,000 a year (which is about what one seat of Salesforce Enterprise costs).
Receiving 45TB in a year takes an average of 11.4Mbps of bandwidth - well within even modest business connections.
But since you're a good network neighbor, you'll want 22.8Mbps of upload bandwidth to keep your ratio at 2.0 (also well within the range of modest business connections, many of which also have no limits on upload/download total).
Keeping up with the CPU load of signature verification is a class of problem we call "embarrassingly parallel" in CS. If one CPU isn't doing it fast enough, just add another. Conformal systems [found]( that ECDSA signature checking was the biggest bottleneck to transaction throughput, and that 10 of their machines clustered would validate 2000 tps. They did not write code for the GPU however, which can deliver [400-800x speedups]( to embarrassingly parallel problems. It is likely a single modern GPU could keep up with 3168 tps with room to spare.
So there you have it - one server with a GPU and one 4U storage box. That's just 5U to reach VISA scale tps (you can forget about needing the whole datacenter). Compare that with VISA's multi-10s-of-megawatt monstrosities to do the same thing (except worse and more centralized) and you're starting to see exactly how well bitcoin scales, and why the finance industry is so afraid of it :)


Independent as in "I know some neutral player/players is/are checking it, I can check with them, and I trust them enough to not collude to steal my coffee money" vs. personal as in "I'm personally wiring the servers up and checking blocks myself because I trust nobody, and/or my transactions are valuable enough for me to care".
Its not surprising to me that there should be a cost to the latter that is greater than the former. Thankfully the cost will never be that much, well within the budget of even a modest business, even at VISA scale. This, again, is because bitcoin scales incredibly well compared to other financial networks *if you let it*.
@_date: 2017-08-21 01:49:52
Others typically validate your block before building on it, and they're still mining on the last block while they do (mining never stops). If they solve before finishing validation + work generation, they will broadcast their solution and potentially orphan you (all solutions are broadcast).
More TX = more time for everyone else to validate = more chance you get orphaned by someone else.
Orphans cost you money, so more TX = more cost for you. This creates a natural fee market where prices fall naturally when technology improves, not when some central committee decides they should fall.

@_date: 2017-08-18 06:30:47
There is always a fee market whether the blocks are full or not, because there's always additional risk to a miner to adding your transaction
@_date: 2017-08-28 20:31:52
Fee estimation is a fundamentally flawed concept, this is why hitting the block size limit is very bad and very disruptive.
The solution is raising the block size limit so that blocks can grow in response to more transactions
@_date: 2017-08-18 06:35:37
Bitcoin isn't getting anywhere near $1M/ea without a lot more block capacity. Right now there just isn't space for the new users, which means they'll put their money elsewhere.
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:55:27


Sorry, but that's just not true. There's been plenty of research so far.
Some shows bitcoin can scale to ~1,000x what it is at right now with little few changes other than raising the block size.


This is an intentional side effect of keeping the block size small (and making other changes that the "Core" team has made that hurt its adoption with merchants, like RBF). They think it would be ideal for people to pay $100 per bitcoin transaction when it only costs the network a fraction of a penny. This is lunacy.
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:35:17
They plan to make every "on chain" transaction cost ~$100, even though it only costs the network a small fraction of a penny to process.
If you wanted to buy BTC and send it to someone, you'd be looking at $200-$300 in fees minimum (slightly more with lightning, which can only make subsequent transactions cheaper).
If that happens, the smallest amount of BTC it will make sense to buy or transact is ~$10,000
They plan to offer corporate-controlled "side chains" that will cost slightly less. Naturally they'll pocket all those fees.
None of that is ever going to happen though - either the block size gets raised, or everybody throws up their hands and says "fuck this, I'm switching to X, Y, or Z"
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:16:22
This is not a use case the current developers plan on supporting in the future, which is why they're advocating for $100 transaction fees.
If you want to use bitcoin for payments, you'll be interested in pushing for bigger blocks

@_date: 2017-11-04 08:33:25
Technically, yes, but reality is (especially in a full block scenario) they're much weaker than capital-B bitcoin transactions.
You have to be online to verify you're not getting stolen from for instance, which is not like bitcoin at all
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:21:20
I understand the concept just fine, you're not understanding me though. Let me try again:
Advocates for halting all block size increases (you haven't done this explicitly, but are doing so implicitly by defending the properties of lightning instead of spending that time advocating for larger blocks) point to their desire to audit the entire network for (basically) free by running a tiny bitcoin node. 
They say it is imperative people be able to do this because they believe it's too dangerous to trust other people to watch the chain for them and flag any counterfeiting (which would be stealing the value of your scarce coins).
When asked about how Bitcoin will scale, they say "don't worry about it, there's the lightning network".
Then you ask about the "watching channel closing" problem, and, like you just did, they turn around and say "oh, you can offload that to large groups of nebulous third parties, trusting the group only in aggregate"
Which is the exact same fucking thing as they were trying to avoid.
If you have to trust nebulous groups of third parties in aggregate anyway, why the hell are you arguing to halt all block size increases?
@_date: 2017-11-04 08:42:55
Okay wise guy, why don't you tell me where can you stay offline and not be sure you're not getting stolen from on LN?
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:12:55
You also want $100 transaction fees then?
@_date: 2017-11-04 08:36:25
Yes, when the blocks are full and a superseded state tx is broadcast but the punish transaction is stuck.
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:40:25
Except if it costs $100 to make a normal on-chain transaction, getting your money locked in a payment channel will cost you $200 in transaction fees
Only then will subsequent transactions through the same hub cost less (i.e. whatever the multimillion-dollar hub owner wants to charge you for transit).
That is, until you run out of funds in your channel and need to spend another $200 to fill it up again.
Is that truly a system you expect rational people to use? Or did you not know that's how lightning works...
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:46:35

There is a point, it brings value to the whole system. More transactions bring more value. If nobody can use it, its dumber than beanie babies.
Also it costs 0.011 *cents* (not dollars) to store 9,000 copies of a transaction using today's hardware, a cost of 0.000001125 *cents* to each node operator. That's the definition of negligible.

Oh cool. So you'll expect a third party to stake your yearly grocery bill in a channel between it and your grocer and you'll just pay $100 to fund the channel between you and them every time it empties?
Or will you choose to drop $100 for the right to lock up all the funds you'll be spending that year in a channel with your grocer and topping up the balance yourself...
What great options!
($100 buys enough storage for 3 years of 20MB blocks *today* btw)
@_date: 2017-11-04 09:52:45
If you spend $100 to open the channel by locking up $1000 and end up spending $900 at the grocery store and the gas station over the course of the month, the channel has to close (your last $100 goes to the closing fee).
Then you get to pay to open another channel by locking up more money...

2X is a hard fork that appears poised to be the majority fork, aka "Bitcoin". Whoever keeps mining the minority chain can call themselves whatever they want, but the rest of us won't consider it bitcoin. That's how Nakamoto consensus works, and if you don't understand that I suggest reading the whitepaper

@_date: 2017-10-07 07:08:49
You say you're not talking about faith or beliefs, but you used the term "altcoin". And you use it to describe the hypothetical majority bitcoin blockchain no less! Forgive my language, but I call bullshit on all of that.
The bitcoin whitepaper is pretty clear here: bitcoin is the longest proof of work chain, no matter what rules change. Its a miner-defined thing, and the stability of the system comes from the fact that miners would likely not choose to change rules that will hurt the price of their BTC reward in the marketplace (because that's against their self interest). Consensus forms by mining whatever chain you support, not by twitter polls, or silly hats, or by deleting enough opposing viewpoints on the subreddit you control.


Then get on the bandwagon my friend, because bigger blocks are coming!
There's a bunch of fanatics who can't figure out how to make money (ahem, blockstream) unless the blocks are kept small, and will never be convinced to raise the limit. They've literally said they'll support bigger blocks "when hell freezes over". So if you really support bigger blocks, you can't also say you don't want schisms - those two ideas are mutually exclusive because of the existence of this radical group. Either they fork off, or the blocks stay 
So do you really support big blocks?

@_date: 2017-10-07 06:51:55
Okay, sorry to have to break this to you, but this hasn't been true for years. You and whoever wrote that answer you linked have information that is woefully out of date.
Miners all participate in fast relay networks that transmit compressed block announcements way faster than the regular network, and with scaling properties much better than the regular network. Otherwise yes, as you point out, their orphan rates (revenue) would suffer.
And even if the scaling properties on those networks weren't that great, or they couldn't validate the block as built as quickly as bigger miners, they can still speculatively SPV mine off the announced header and make up 99% of the difference while their system validates the rest of the block.
So no, there's no effective reduction in mining revenue to small miners because of bigger blocks (except in the very naive case). Anybody who told you otherwise either 1) didn't know what they were talking about or 2) was trying to deceive you

Except I wasn't talking about *not limiting bandwidth usage* was I?


Well if you had bothered to actually check my numbers before proclaiming them "bullshit" you would have noticed that 5.1 Mbit/sec for 128MB blocks accounts for relaying 2 copies of every block downloaded.
You do realize that every node only needs *one* copy of every block, yes? And that means that *on average* every node will only upload *one* copy of every block received? (some will upload more, some will upload less)
This should not be an alien concept, BitTorrent swarms run exactly the same way... some people are net leechers, some run seed boxes in datacenters with huge upload ratios, but every swarm that's popular stays healthy.


You do know that the inventors of the lightning network, *in their pitch deck*, said it would require a 133MB base block size to run worldwide, right?
Who knows, maybe its me that's delusional and not you. At least I'm in good company.

@_date: 2017-05-17 18:56:07


I won't claim you are either, but you're definitely close! You just need a little more math and real numbers and you'll be golden. Let's go over some, shall we?




Have you seen how long it takes a modern CPU to validate the chain as it is right now? Little hint: take the total amount of time to get to a certain block height, divide the number of transactions to that point by the time it takes. Validation is CPU bound.
Also, math is your friend: it's generally better to run a quick calculation than use vague assertions like "I don't see that with the current tech"


There is little you can glean from this statement that will help you with the above estimate... its like the extra info 4th grade teachers throw into word problems to confuse you.


You'll have to define "reasonable timeframe". If the network is running at 2k TPS and your cpu can do 7, then you can validate everything coming in *plus* everything going backwards at 2.5x real time. More CPUs = more speed as the validation is embarrassingly parallel. Validation could also see a &gt;OOM speedup from using the GPU, but that's yet to be implemented.


Except I wasn't talking about mining nodes, was I? I'm talking about the node everybody here who *doesn't mine* wants (for some reason) to run from their closet. Those nodes *can* take a whole 10 minutes to validate. Miners will likely want to invest in more CPUs, Optane disks for the UTXO set, pre-validation of transactions, more RAM, speculative mining strategies, and other optimizations that wallet-only nodes don't need to worry about.
Actual miners have sometimes multimillion dollar investments in datacenter hardware to take care of and are not as cost constrained as home users.


You are aware that the inventors of the lightning network *in their pitch deck* call for 133MB blocks, right? That's *with* lightning. I guess that makes me and them both delusional though...


I think most miners would agree with you. Today 20MB seems like a safe bet, with moves up towards 128, 256, and 512 in the not too distant future.
@_date: 2017-05-17 19:28:12
There's nothing you've said here in this 2nd post that's wrong re: today's situation.
I did take issue with your assertion "it never was designed" to be cheap and fast. It was cheap and fast for many years until the current management crisis, and there's no technical reason why it can't be cheap and fast again (while maintaining the "being in control of your own money" feature).
I also object to your assertion that returning to cheap and fast in any way "throw(s) out the main purpose of Bitcoin", because, far from being "erroneous selling points", cheap and fast are part and parcel of "the main purpose of bitcoin".
Without cheap and fast there's no reason to believe bitcoin will gain mainstream adoption, little reason to believe the price will continue to rise, and therefore little reason to stay invested in it.
@_date: 2017-05-17 07:11:28


Thanks for starting out with an insult in bad faith. Really helps get your point across /s


You'll have to define "very cheap" for me - none of the numbers I quoted above I would define as "impossibly expensive", which means a bitcoin running at anything under 2GB blocks is very much better than PayPal in my book.


What about the numbers above makes you think you can't run a node over TOR?
Also, even if you couldn't run a node over TOR at those speeds, if one (or anything less than all) nation state(s) bans bitcoin, the citizens can still use SPV to access full nodes in unaffected countries... no?


Really? I thought it was because people could "run a node for very cheap from your home connection", which is it?
I think what you meant to say is that SPV is safe as long as some random civilians could spin up full nodes - not all. I guess you mean that, because that's how things are now and SPV is perfectly safe.


Seriously though, again, what about the above numbers suggests anything like "it will be impossible to run a full node from home" - I'm dying to know.

Price lags fundamentals. If the blocks remain full, the fees high, and confirmations slow, little to none of the growth in the crypto market will find its way to Bitcoin, and fees will eventually drop closer to the marginal cost of including transactions in a block.

I'm genuinely interested in your answer (if you're not just exaggerating to try and make a point).

It matters because hashrate determines rule changes on the network. If you want rule changes to be implemented, they have to be rule changes that people who are *actually invested* in the health of the network agree to. You can whine all you want that they're "blocking (insert dump proposal here)", or you can incentivize them to accept it.


Except that not changing that number is exactly why the miners aren't running segwit code...

This notion, that centralized databases are more efficient in financial networks, is one that *sounds true* to someone narrowly focused on the computer science aspect of *one component* of such a system, but is actually quite incorrect when the whole system is taken into account.
To see why this is the case, look up what computer systems are in place to (for example) detect fraudulent credit card transactions. They're massive, and massively complex, and must be massively protected from intrusion which all ends up being much more expensive than the database that ultimately does the adding and subtracting. If you just focus on that little database you miss 95% of the whole picture.
Bitcoin, on the other hand, doesn't concern itself with the validity of a transaction beyond checking the signature and the existence of valid UTXO. A Bitcoin node doesn't need to close your account if it suddenly sees large purchases coming from Russia - it doesn't care as long as the UTXO and signature are valid. Bitcoin pushes those concerns onto it's users, and so is free to be massively efficient in implementation. Bitcoin nodes can also be infiltrated without anybody losing money or sensitive data, so they can be run in resource-poor, non-PCI compliant IT environments. This is a huge win for cost savings.
The only thing Bitcoin has that's less efficient than all other financial networks? The need for hundreds to thousands of copies of the database for security.
But when you realize how small a component of any existing financial network the database is, you begin to see why Bitcoin wins so hard (if you don't strangle it's growth and turn away users with arbitrary limits).
Don't take my word for it either: take the monthly cost to run a node at Visa scale (hint: it's about $350), multiply it out by the number of nodes you want in a realistically secure Bitcoin network, and see how it compares to the monthly IT budget of Visa and it's network partners (those numbers are often in regulatory fillings).
I think given your position earlier that you'll be pleasantly surprised by the results (and very proud of Bitcoin once more)
@_date: 2017-05-17 23:08:57
1) 99% of the world already has no hope of finding a block. You need a massive investment of capital to amass enough hashpower to solo mine - everybody else mines for pools.
2) a modern CPU can verify ~7k TPS, that's a roughly 1.8GB of transactions in 10 minutes. Block verification can be done in parallel on multiple CPUs also.
So, yes it could.
You know what's a dumb solution? Turning customers away for zero technical reason. That's a great recipe to get left behind by the market.
@_date: 2017-05-17 06:55:38


News flash: practically nobody wants to run this now. Not a huge change here.


A single modern CPU can validate ~7k TPS. I would check your definition of "impossible".


This will take longer, yes


It will be bigger. Is that a problem? Again, an archiving node only needs to validate the block before the next one comes in, so it has 10 whole minutes to accomplish this task. You can keep the UTXO set on disk (or SSD, or Optane) and validate in that time easily.


Where's the imagination? The creativity? I'm glad you're bringing up all the things that will be *somewhat challenging* in the move to higher block sizes, but when you stop there without thinking about how to solve the problems you're just whining.

Well you're definitely right there - the rise in BTC's market cap is one measure of this activity. The even larger rise in the alts (ignore XRP, we all know its a scam) I think shows the counter point though: much of the growth is passing BTC by the wayside.


I think we're at that point now. My numbers say that 128-256MB blocks are actually pretty safe from a node cost perspective, with room to grow in the future.


Time will tell, but my money's not on Segwit hitting 95% (even if Wu somehow decides he wants to about-face)

No "average home" in the USA runs a 1MB bitcoin node, forget the Philippines.
Give the *average user* a choice between SPV, a 1MB full node, and a 1GB full node and they're going to choose SPV *every time*.
SPV gives a user access to every feature of Bitcoin except the "personally verify and archive every transaction that has ever occurred on the network" feature. Little hint: very few people need this feature.
As for *businesses* based in the Philippines who might make heavy use of bitcoin (and therefore would actually have a reason to use a full node)
Maybe $73/mo is too much for them?
If you wanted to make an argument we keep the cap just under 256MB until they can reasonably afford more (or until we can write software to shard the chain database for them to keep only the parts they care about) - I probably wouldn't argue with you.
But under 128MB? (or less?) Come on, that's just silly.
@_date: 2017-07-08 14:34:25
I have friends that spend more than $75/mo on their torrent seed boxes. $75 a year is peanuts.

I also don't want only a few corporations to be able to run nodes - that's not what I signed up for at all!
I think it takes a lot more than most people think to get there though, and to demonstrate why I'd like to share two thoughts (if you'll bear with me):
First, at Visa scale (1-2GB blocks), my calculations put the cost to keep a full copy at home (or in the back room at your small business) at under $400/month (I urge you to check that, it's an enlightening exercise). That's less than it costs to hire one minimum wage employee, which I'd argue puts it well within reach for any size business (not only large ones) or upper middle class (and above) individual (a category which would certainly include all of us if bitcoin were ever to get so popular).
A computer that size would also fit in just 4U (roughly 1/10th of a server rack), making it easy to stuff just about anywhere (i.e. no datacenter necessary).
Second, the nature of bitcoin's decentralization means that all it takes for an attack on the network to be discovered (and thus punished in the market, and thus effectively thwarted) is for one single person in possession of a full copy of the chain to not be "in" on the attack (presuming they tell others when they've discovered such an attack, although perhaps after buying some put options).
This property makes for a very robust system indeed. Even if there's only a few hundred nodes (and yes, ideally there's many more) the likelihood of getting collusion from *all* of them is vanishingly small, and anything other than perfect collusion would lead to almost certain discovery.
And that's two! I hope I've not bored you.
@_date: 2017-05-21 17:01:04
I'm well aware of the issue, and its a problem of giving away bandwidth to leechers without open ports, NOT a problem with the size of blocks.
Perhaps it would be improved if people stopped telling newbies they need a full node when they *don't*, never have, and never will.
It will certainly be improved with more modern bandwidth controls
@_date: 2017-07-08 02:34:07
32MB does indeed require an additional 1.68TB per year, your numbers are correct.
That represents a cost of about $6.30/month at current HDD prices.
I strongly disagree that $6.30/mo. is prohibitive, especially when most users of bitcoin have no need for a full copy of the blockchain.

There are 125 million households in the USA, and 7015 bitcoin nodes worldwide at last count...
If every one of those were in USA households, 0.006% of them would have a node.
Like I said - no "average home" in the USA runs a 1MB bitcoin node. If you're running a full node you're anything but average no matter what your net specs are.
Shit, if you happen to have heard of Bitcoin or used it you're anything but average. Chances are - if you did use it - you did so over SPV and it worked just fine (except for transaction processing delays, which are starting to get ridiculous).

Bootstrapping a new financial network is a very hard problem. It takes time, and it takes lots of users and lots of merchants making lots of transactions before the network effect is strong enough to start sucking in the rest of the world.

2mb hardfork is worthless in terms of scaling, why risk the hf on such a useless upgrade? 128MB - 256MB is more like it - at least that gets us closer to the 133MB that the inventors of LN said would be necessary for full LN adoption
@_date: 2017-05-17 20:32:34
Then bitcoin can HF to 1GB and fulfill 99% of the use cases for which you need bitcoin, only better because user adoption will lead to your wealth growing much faster.

Because basically nobody but some fanatics on reddit are going to follow the UASF chain... bitcoin will yawn and move on while they fork themselves off
@_date: 2017-07-07 17:07:35
Um, some corrections for you:
A hard fork does not guarantee a chain split.
Soft forks can cause chain splits too.
Any fork (hard or soft) with minority hashpower (like the UASF proposed) does guarantee a chain split.

I'm aware of how hard forks work, thank you.


SegWit does not change the base block size, which is what the HK agreement stipulated.


Classic was a change of the base block size to 2MB. That is not the same as SegWit. You may need to do some more reading my friend.


Again, the miners stated *very clearly* what features they wanted to run, and those included an increase of the *base block size* (there's that concept you need to look up again) to 2MB. There should be zero surprise they are unwilling to run software without the features they requested.

Big blocker here, strongly disagree with your analysis of motives. My views below:
As a private citizen I have virtually no need for a copy of the blockchain, because the chance of all the nodes my SPV wallet connects to colluding to defraud me or censor my transactions are negligible.
As a business owner, were bitcoin to reach VISA scale I would certainly consider maintaining a copy of the chain on premises, but not because I would be afraid of being defrauded or censored, more to reference locally for any/all transactions I'm involved with (and because $400/mo isn't that expensive, and a VISA-scale node fits in 4U).
If bitcoin stagnates at 1MB blocks I can't imagine doing much business in bitcoin (there being too little space for customer transactions).

Unlike some in the community, I don't intend to try and stop the market doing anything it clearly wants to do.
I merely point out you can't honestly say things like:


Because, in fact, no part of that statement is correct.
You should correct your post to reflect that fact if you value intellectual honesty.
@_date: 2017-07-07 18:05:33
I have two questions for you brought up by your post:
What use, in your estimation, do "most people" have for a full copy of the blockchain?
What size blocks exactly, in your estimation, would make "most people" unable to keep a full copy for themselves if the wanted it?
@_date: 2017-05-17 06:39:58
The miners have said they'll run SegWit when it includes code for a 2MB hard fork. They said this years ago. Has core tried enticing them with that maybe?
@_date: 2017-07-07 17:58:44
How much $/mo. do you think it costs to run a node at VISA scale?
Judging by this post my guess is you're overestimating it, but I could be wrong which is why I ask...
@_date: 2017-05-18 14:58:55
You'll want to do a search for the "Hong Kong consensus" or the "Hong Kong agreement" - read the text carefully, they stated the conditions under which they would run SegWit fairly plainly
@_date: 2017-05-16 23:52:09


Its not an immediate block size increase, it's predicated on people using SegWit transactions. Also at this pace with 67%+ of the hashpower rejecting it its never going to activate as is, so its a moot point.


They've explained this in the HK agreement. They agreed to run Segwit code if it included a &gt;= 2MB *hard fork* increase of the *base block size*. Why is it confusing to you that they don't want to re-negotiate that stance?
@_date: 2017-07-07 19:01:40


Setting aside the fact that knowledge of bitcoin at this point makes one rather elite already, I'm interested in knowing what cost/mo. of running a node you think risks the network running into this problem you've laid out (keeping in mind all the network's security properties, particularly that defrauding SPV wallets requires not only a 51% of the hashpower, but the collusion of all reachable nodes, and ditto for transaction censorship).
I ask the second question because the residential bandwidth limit you mentioned (most often 1TB in the US) is more of an argument for not raising the blocksize above ~32MB, but bringing up that argument now makes it seem like you're against raising the cap from 1MB to, say, 2MB or 8MB or 20MB (none of which would trigger that issue).
Are you actually against such modest increases?

Splitting the chain implies there's somebody mining a different chain. If nobody is willing to mine the tighter ruleset, there is no chain split. You can't honestly say "guaranteed chain split" because of this fact, sorry.

The math behind likely success/failure of a protocol upgrade is well published and need not be reiterated here. I suggest you read it.


This would be slightly less wrong than your original statement, and therefore an improvement. Again, I suggest you read up on the likelihood of success of any given protocol upgrade with regards to hashrate support. Suffice to say that 100% is overkill, especially with the dynamics of difficulty retargeting in bitcoin.

You said it yourself: Bitcoin works like bit torrent. You don't need to upload more than what, 3x what you download?
If you've a 1TB limit and want to devote half to Bitcoin then you can support a, what, 28MB block, no?
Again, no regular user has to do this - for Bitcoin's security it's enough that one full node in the network isn't colluding in any given attack.
@_date: 2017-06-06 18:19:05
There's no need for a node to be in a data center even at Visa scale. Have you done the numbers on that assertion recently?

GMaxwell is out there saying 1MB is the limit forever - also one of the main opponents of raising the block size. If you want us to stop listening to him immediately, I'm all for it!
You know what else you said that I agree with? We shouldn't build the A380 today.
Bitcoin isn't ready for Visa levels (1-2GB blocks) yet - not for at least 2-5 years.
I suggest we keep the block size under 128MB until we know the effect it will have on the network - and we implore miners not to raise their soft limits too quickly in the mean time. That way we solve the biggest problem in bitcoin first (fees and congestion) and give ourselves time to work on the other problems as they come up. Sound good to you?
@_date: 2017-06-06 04:50:12
Well he did get a couple things right: the block size is a kind of barrier, and the transaction history builds on the blockchain.
Just about everything else he said is wrong though, dunno why people think this guy's opinion is worth the bits its stored on.
@_date: 2017-06-07 07:25:43
Common sense that tells you an optimal place to run the network is where the monthly cost to run a node is less than a single tx fee?
"Common sense" as in "I heard a bunch of people parroting gmax on Reddit so it must be correct - no need to think for myself"?
Seriously - would love to hear your answer to my question: what research have you done that suggests 1MB (or even 1.7MB) is the optimal magic block size the network should be running at?

I've done the research, did it years ago, and like Satoshi came to the conclusion that the 1MB limit should be raised before it was hit, or bad things would happen to bitcoin's adoption and network health.
Even if he somehow changed his mind in the meantime, which there's no indication he has, I'd still disagree with him because I'm capable of doing my own research and making up my own mind.
What research have *you* done that suggests the 1MB limit is optimal? Or would you rather let others do the thinking for you...
@_date: 2017-06-06 06:26:00
you know that the *real* satoshi nakamoto suggested a flag day blocksize raise years ago, right?
@_date: 2017-06-07 07:13:37
Wow, actually impressed - most people *haven't* run the numbers, you actually have (at least some of them), so kudos for that. Upvoted!
I think of Visa as average throughput, not necessarily peak, but would like to see any node have at least 50% extra capacity for that "Christmas" rush you aptly pointed out. My numbers have blocks closer to 1.2GB average to handle the ~100 billion tx/year that Visa clears.
I think you'll find a modern cpu can verify ~7k TPS, so no worries there (but yes, it will have to be dedicated). And latency isn't an issue (just relaying and storing) you don't need the UTXO set in ram, so no worries there.
So you see then that you don't *need* a data center to run a node, yes? Especially because the bandwidth can be done over a residential connection.
Visa levels *today* might be more than what an average home user wants to throw down (I disagree they are impossible) but then the average home user was never going to run a full node anyway (most don't, even now: they use exchanges or SPV), and serious Bitcoiners with serious money on the line were never going to turn off their nodes. In fact, if bitcoin ever got that popular you'd likely find a much wider audience of small and medium businesses that want to run nodes!
Here's the real question though: what's the monthly cost of running a Visa scale node, and how does it compare to other business costs a small firm might face?
@_date: 2017-06-06 18:36:32


No its not. That parameter doesn't become an engineering one until there's no physical way to store the transactions anymore.
Correcting your analogy: it would be like some engineer in 1911 (8 years after the wright brothers flew) telling me an airplane will never ever ever be able to carry 100 tonnes of payload, and anybody who suggests otherwise should just shut up and listen to engineers.
Your ravings aside, the actual argument has been this for years:
Raise the blocksize or fees and confirmation times will go parabolic and people will use other blockchains.
Right now it costs less per month to run a full node than it does to make a single transaction - it doesn't take a suit or a neckbeard to realize that's suboptimal, especially when most users don't need or want to run full nodes. Bitcoin's plummeting market share is the lagging indicator that what we've been saying for years is indeed the case - when are you planning on waking up and smelling the coffee?
@_date: 2017-06-06 06:24:54
his whole analogy, the idea that the parameter is an engineering one and not economic, the notion that the "fence" isn't arbitrary, and the implied suggestion that nodes wouldn't be able to keep up with an even slightly larger blocksize
Really everything stated in the OP except what I mentioned is wrong, backwards, or both
