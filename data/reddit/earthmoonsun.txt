- Sex (e.g. homosexuality)  
and, of course

Yes, they do. Most cases might not, and I doubt that this one has a chance.

I wish the Russians all the best, especially a better government, Russia has a lot of potential, could be a rich country and a leader in many fields. Unfortunately, its management is a catastrophe, its people deserve better.


What you mean? I'm not talking about interests in politics.  
I'm just saying that Bitcoin will succeed or fail independent from decisions made in Russia. Russia is too small to have any monetary impact. For example, if the US$ becomes worthless, there will be a global crisis. If the rubel falls, only Russia has a problem.

Sorry, I cannot follow this logic. To me, this contract just says that one party gave the coins to another party.  
It says nothing about the way it was done. It could have been a handover of the private keys (e.g. paper wallets), or telling the password of a wallet that contains all of Satoshi's addresses, or a hard disk with the coins, or whatever. No need to have it mentioned on the blockchain.

Dogecoin is great to attract more people to cryptos in general. Sometimes PR and Marketing requires constantly making noise and dance at the edge of annoying to get some attention.

I think the future doesn't look bright for new technologies in Russia. The current government focus on nationalism and the old industries/natural resources. IT is mainly seen as a threat to stability than a possibility for development. Putin mentioned several times that he's skeptic about the internet and doesn't use it. He even stays away from mobile phones.
I don't know what I should suggest. I don't think you can win, I don't think you can make a successful career in the IT sector in current Russia. But leaving your home is of course a big step, too.

They are stupid, from an economic perspective, not if your goal is totalitarian.  
Look at the recent IT related decision, slowly a once growing internet industry is confronted with regulations or insane control by the government (e.g. VK).  
I don't think the Russian government is convinced of the potential of Bitcoins at all. Putin mentioned several times that he doesn't like the internet. This guy even doesn't use a mobile phone. The political elite of Russia purely relies on exploitation of their natural resources and neglect any other industry. It's sad to see that a country with a lot of potential is managed so bad. 
But who cares as long as the elite gets richer and the vodka flows.

You don't give the seller your bank data but to a company (Sofort AG) who offers this direct bank transfer service. Actually, it's similar to PayPal.
However, bitcoinkaufen.eu looks very shady.

Both make this company look anything but reliable.

@_date: 2014-02-26 09:47:39
I use them for a long time now. I just experienced 2 times that the site was down for a short time, probably some maintenance. None of my coins disappeared. I like that they send me a mail for verification when I want to withdraw coins. But their support is terrible. There was one occurrence that really sucked. I sent a support ticket and they cc'ed to everyone who had the same question. So my mail address is now known to ten other people.

I wouldn't consider a post every now and then spam.
I think if it's good for Dogecoin, it is good for Bitcoin, too. So, Bitcoin only profits of a successful Nascar promotion.  
It's totally justified to censor some other no-market-cap scam coin posts, though. Those really add no value, whereas Dogecoin introduces many people to cryptos and creates some media attention.

Great idea! I think the layout can be improved, e.g. below the header there are 2 columns (menu, text), below there are still 2 colums (quote/price, video) but with different width. Just gives a little messy feeling.

Yes, it's a lazy answer but appropriate for your comment.
  
Why can't something "new and not yet operational" not be promising
and a perfect upcoming solution? Do you really think a service is trustworthy only because it's operated by 2 big companies?  
Pretty naive in my opinion.

Doesn't that mean that the ISP/ government can easily block Bitcoin and instantly kill the whole crypto currency idea?

Abuse of privacy, for example. If there's no privacy anymore, less people would take the risk to uncover crime and corruption out of fear of retribution. You might not get a job/insurance because of the probability of a certain illness. You need to pay a higher interest rate because you once, long time ago didn't repay a loan in time. Private matters suddenly interfere with your career, etc
Shaping your opinion. By deciding which results are on top, Google already has the power to influence your decision making. Facebook/Twitter can highlight/delete certain posts before elections.

Of course, but I wouldn't rely on that. 


Browser, OS, and software and apps can already contain lots of information about the user. There's a lot of data transfer in the background.


Smaller, but not small.  
You can read the docs by Snowden or at related subreddits. They all say Apple is to be avoided regarding privacy, and because everything is so closed source, it might be even worse than MS.  
But I guess the people who use Apple love their products, don't care, and are totally happy with their slick design, image, and easy usage. Different preferences. That's their niche.

Ross. Ross knew the risk and got rich of it. Therefore, I wouldn't donate to him, even though I think the gov's war on drugs is fucked up.  
Snowden didn't profit from his actions, therefore and because of his contribution to freedom and democracy, he has my support.   
As I said in the very beginning, I value Snwoden higher than Ross. And Kim Dotcom, well, even though the government didn't act correct, he's a psycho.

In general, I agree with what you say. Just not in this case. These evolution guys belong to the worst.

Usually the Chinese don't like political antics like those of Putin. Too unpredictable.  
They want to grow their wealth because they understood that nowadays you can only become a world power when your economy is doing well.  
Putin still thinks military and propaganda is the key to everything, like in the 60s maybe. It's sad to see, because this country has the potential to do so much better.  
China is only nice towards Russia as long as they can buy cheap gas. Russia's only real friends are other losers like Venezuela or  Belaurus.

It was definitely better. That's why people like Andreas and others left.  
The quality of posts went down. And discussions used to be more informative, too. This sub was a place of many ideas and didn't attempt to shape one opinion.  
Anyway, in the long-term it is good because it helps the growth of other pages. In the end, Bitcoin is very much about decentralization. Just currently, it's a pretty sad situation and not welcoming for newbies.

You really don't get it. Creating awareness is the most important thing now to make Bitcoin grow and become established. And so far Dogecoin did a great job in helping all cryptos to get attention. Doge might not be the right coin for you but it introduces this new technology to many people who normally are not that much involved in technology and economy, and who think Bitcoin is too nerdy and serious. This is not a competition between BTC, Doge, LTC or whatever, this is about cryptos vs. fiat, people's currency vs. banks

No. There shouldn't be good coins/bad coins. There shouldn't be an authority who decides which coins are ok and which ones are not.  
However, this doesn't mean stealing shouldn't be punished. And even though it is difficult, it is not impossible to find this thief without destroying the very ideas of Bitcoin, e.g. follow the transactions, find whatever digital tracks he left.

I don't understand why people buy the overpriced Apple products. Sure, they look nice and are easy to use, but does it really justify that crazy price? I think most Apple users buy them to increase their self-esteem and show off.

Thanks. The last case you mentioned only happens if new addresses are created after the backup, right?

I learned my lesson and got scammed.

Personally, I would like to see it, and if you want to attract 0-35 yr old ppl, that's a good idea. But if you want to promote it to older folks, no. I think for them it will make Bitcoin just look shady. That's also why any company in the financial industry tries to look as serious as possible. Those liars....

Unfortunately yes. I lend 3 people some coins, just one paid back, 6 weeks later than promised.

What's the difference between CoinJoin and Send Shared? Which one is more secure?

Call it Religion instead of Country and you can almost do everything in the U.S.

My computer broke down and I had a few Bitcoins in my Bitcoin-qt wallet. Are the Bitcoins still in my secure wallet .dat file? How to import them into the Bitcoin-qt client on my new PC?

I got scammed by a few people. Be careful. And their support sucks.

If someone watches SR could they know from which account the coins went to my wallet? Or do they just know that it comes from SR in general?

Can anyone explain this transaction to me: blockchain.info/tx/c59bca2004f16940d7bc51dbcb669d9d2c592f5760ed7435ff3a84cc5f3dec5d
Did 10 accounts transfer to 2 accounts? Then why is it just 1 transaction? Who send how much to whom? Thanks

Some months ago I tried that, too. No reply so far.

Sure. That's great, of course. I didn't mean that it's not a high quality product, just think the price and hype is too crazy.
