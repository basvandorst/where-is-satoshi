That's exactly why there shouldn't be an artificial limit on the block size, the limit will be determined by the force of free market. Miners will have to dynamically reaching a consensus on what's the most suitable block size that fits the current transaction traffic, as the mining reward halves, miner will be even more incentivized to include more transactions, mass adoption and hyper bitcoinization will soon follow.

I agree, we should let the free market sort it out, rather than imposing limits on the block size. More transaction = more fees for miner, faster confirmation for everyone = microtransaction = mass adoption.

go read the whitepaper, other miners can simply reject this block and not build on top it

Much better solution than changing the block size which will no doubt cripple the network, good work guys!

Yeah well that's 50k usd down the toilet for me. It's okay though I will be alright. Just need some time to let it sink in... 
I just bought some futures on okcoin, when the swap reversal comes I will make some back. Hard times...

Please stop this kind of witch hunting. It really is meaningless, why are bitcoin people always angry and need to find something to attack every two weeks? Like, first it was Sean's Outpost, then Western Union then Warrent Buffet then GAW/PayCoin, then BitStamp and now cycle back to Theymos.
Dude, that 6000 BTC came mostly from Ads and spare change donation when Bitcoin was worth single~double digits and people donated some spare change after they made money from Bitcoin's early bubbles. And you are just bitter he has so much money now, I am sure Theymos will be happy to return the original equivalent value to people who donated. (I bet you are not one of them)
I gave away bunch of 1BTC Casascius coins (50+) to my friends and relatives back in 2012, and I am not asking them to return those coins to me nor do I regret my decision.

This is not gentleman. You have to hold man. The price will only go up if we all hold. The mining problems can be solved by timelocking the rewards. I.e. Miners can't sell until X months latter.

You can mine a block with billion txs but other mines just won't build on top of it.

Good. We don't need a centralized dictatorship to interfere with core development.

mass adoption

I also keep most of my money in bitcoin. If other shitcoins have value you can be pretty damn sure bitcoin is going to go up. I am not looking to get rich from bitcoin but I know for sure it will outperform shit fiats. Commodity though volatile, they never lose value like fiats which is guaranteed to lose value. I shut up and I hold.

You can just google those, the white papers and dev meeting information are all on the web. I am not saying ALL advanced improvements are developed in Israel, I am just saying they made a lot of contribution to the cryptocurrency space.

I think this is great for Bitcoin. It shows how information can be traded in a trustless manner and using anonymous auction to obtain a fair market value for these data. Imagine how much possibilities this will bring. It's only the beginning.

The most advanced improvements - colored coins, Zerocash (zerocoin), Ghost protocol, Mastercoin, multisig arbitration - are all being developed in Israel.
