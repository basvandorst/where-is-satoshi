These are the hurdles of escaping your local fiat currency. When you're in Cryptoland, you are free.
My advice:
sign up to localbitcoins.com, meet someone who shares your enthusiasm at a local coffee shop, hit up an ATM on the way, pay cash. If he is trustworthy, meet him again a few more times to buy more.
Now you have anonymous btc, as opposed to identity connected btc (ie. banks, taxes, income reporting, and the like)
And boom, can be done in a few hours tonight. When you have found a nice seller you gel with and build a relationship, buying btc is as simple as sending an e transfer to a friend (in the banks eyes)

I am so tired of this "getting money out of China" crap we keep talking about. Yes people can convert their money to Bitcoin and send it across borders. 
But the Yuan for example hasn't "left china". If I buy Bitcoin from the US and exchange my currency with another user for their bitcoins, this user now has the USD, and guess what - it's still in the country. 
It is tantamount to two people standing in a room, they trade currencies, and one sends Bitcoin out of the room - the yuan is still just as valid and still in the room. 
Saying Bitcoin is allowing Capital flight is one thing, which in a sense it is. But there is no "getting money out of China" as the buyer, who bought the Yuan with Bitcoin hasn't gone anywhere.

This was interesting and I enjoyed reading your comment. Up votes to you. 
I agree that Bitcoin doesn't necessarily solve the problem when converting to USD, however it does remove the holder from the fiat system in a way that can be looked at like getting the asset "liquid", or "off the grid". 
At least in the sense that in Bitcoin ecosystems they may have more options available to them.
Who knows, without adequate user-by-user metrics it's impossible to say exactly who is buying volume, whether they are institutional, private sector, or otherwise. 
I guess that's part of the charm, in 15 years when we have all these Bitcoin millionaires coming out of the woodwork it will be interesting to see who rode the wave into the public eye.
As we see now with the early early adopters turned crypto celeb.

I'm down, but I have difficulty accepting that the government would be in fear of the capital leaving, because it's not actually leaving.
In other words - should the US government fear that my 1 million dollars is now in your hands after I bought Bitcoin from you? All things considered equal nothing has changed.
EXAMPLE: 
US CITIZEN 1 has 1 million dollars. He trades it for bitcoin.
US CITIZEN 2 has bitcoin worth 1 million, he trades it for dollars.
When did the wealth leave the states? The government has nothing to fear. Even it it's one person buying from many people, the wealth is just distributed.
If I sold 1 million dollars in exchange for 1 million chocolate bars, would the government be worried that wealth is leaving the country when I ship my chocolate bars?

It is rising fast, not like it did in the past. My advice is that if you are a long term holder, you shouldn't worry about it if it dips. Consider that money turned to Bitcoin, and wait for 2020, and on the dips: buy some more if you are long terming it.
Think of it like a lottery savings that could go bust but is looking more and more appealing as the world currencies race to the bottom.

So set up a trust fund that locks your funds for years. And pray there is no reason, like a security exploit, sinking value, legality or emergency that requires you to move your funds before that period. I'm sure everything will work out perfectly. Oh - except you can't because most wallets don't support this asinine feature because of how ridiculous it's premise is.
You can get upset at me all you want, but it is clear that the vast majority of developers don't take this bip seriously enough to implement it.
We've got this radical new technology in an ecosystem of rapidly evolving cryptocurrencies, regulations, and technological hurdles, rendering your assets non-transferable in turbulent and ever changing times is insanity. 
You haven't invested more then enough to lose eh? Okay, well then why lock them at all? Let your child have access to the funds whenever so they can spend them if they want to - you can't claim you're not worried about "losing them" and then following up with "I want them in a trust for until they are 18 so they aren't spent and we lose them". This line of thinking is shit-brained, it's contradictory at best, and technologically oblivious at worst.

Listen, this is the reality. We have never had a technology like Bitcoin, we don’t know if it is more currency oriented, or more settlement store of wealth oriented. It may be that that’s what this bitcoin battle is all about between devs, ideologies, the forks and so on. 
We are learning, what Bitcoin is, and what it means. Bitcoin has been very volatile.
So use this handy equation.
If price of coin vs risk of value rise / fall = or &lt; value of potential purchase
Use as currency and make purchase

@_date: 2017-01-04 18:06:23
Hey don't sweat it it's actually not intuitive. Technically currencies that are pegged to Bitcoin DO increase when Bitcoin goes up. But it is only because generally it is pegged to Bitcoin and not other currencies. It makes trading between coins to escape Bitcoin velocity less efficient.

We always have to invariably end up retreating down and holding the highest bottom we can it’s just the cycle..

U guys are a bunch of babies. Why is it important to have a feature that makes your bitcoin unavailable to you. 
Seriously, can you explain to me a single use case where this is a valuable feature other than "because I'm scared I'm gonna panic and sell it"
It's an absolutely absurd feature that was implemented by an absurd developer.
There is a reason why no wallets or services are using it. I'm sorry stating the obvious hurts your feelings.
Go ahead, lock your bitcoin up because you don't trust yourself or your own security measures. I'm fine with simply not spending it and retaining the same functionality of it not moving, with the advantage of having it liquid if I ever need it.
I hope you all lock up your coins and get into a situation where you NEED access to it but don't have it because you removed it's ability to function as a transferable asset.
Luke-jr is the bip developer, take a look at his questionable track record both in terms of software and business relationships.

Yes, but it’s better to spend it to a burn address. If enough users send it to a burn address it won’t have enough of a supply.

Seeing this chain structure leads me to believe that forks could be programmatically sound ways to institute policy changes that can be featured as continued fork for different use cases. Very interesting epiphany... 
Ie. A trickle down macroeconomic token system where forks are generated for specific use cases. A type of quarantine mechanism for locking or migrating funds into specific micro compatibility ecosystems that are paired with the forks they can support.

Instead of 78 millibits... I guess others would rather not think about it and let it sort itself out, whereas I feel like naming is extremely important given the understanding that comes with it.

How much btc did he get?
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:13:23
The problem is, tell me at the cash register how you would notify me that my purchase costs .00736253
“Sir, that will be ___________ bitcoin”
I am proposing it would be nice to say something like 73 bits and 36 millies
@_date: 2017-09-29 02:12:55
Um. What?
A time traveller can just go to 2009 and then mine all of them...
@_date: 2017-10-12 04:05:51
There isn’t... if this expiration date is truly indicative of that, then this is the nail in the coffin... come on guys...

Dude just don’t do it it’s so easy to get caught.
To satisfy your curiosity here is a simplified way in which you could get caught.
Guy sends you bitcoins, you register your bank account at coinbase and start receding and selling them. Suddenly you have large deposits coming into your bank, and large withdrawals, the bank would start to seek an answer to what this is and either ask you about it or look up the service provider to which they will find it’s bitcoin related.
The bills you are withdrawing are serial numbered and identifiable, they leave your hands and go to your friends and your friend puts them into a bank account or otherwise where the serials can be identified.
Now they are aware that 90% of the funds you withdrew went to him and they can make that connection because he deposited them. Also Because you are cashing out bitcoin you may be liable for capital gains tax at the end of the year as the exchange to Your local currency is a taxable event, adding tax evasion to the list of potential worries. 
Or you could sell them on local bitcoins, but at that point tell your friend to do that himself.
Listen, this is so dirty and easily identifiable it’s about as simple a money launder as u can do without any obfuscation via businesses or partnerships etc. 
Because of your tenacity at getting answers from multi facets you could assume this is like a SWIM post. If that is the case, you won’t find what you need here, try elsewhere.

Don’t u see the folly in this? That there is no short hand way to say this 9 digit number?
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:02:15
Can you elaborate on why this is good?  When I tell people you don’t need to buy a whole bitcoin. They say they didn’t know that. Then I tell them there are denominations.
They ask what they are and I tell them and they are more confused, it’s not clear which denomination is which and how much it’s worth. Worths like macro, micro, milli, these are all embedded in the current cultural lexicon. 
The others are not. Can you elaborate or are you popping in to dismiss the need for clear currency valuation metrics?
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:47:00
I agree, but given that the valuation of bitcoin could be wildly high, there is a big distinction between .2522 btc and .2599 btc so saying a “quarter could be give or take thousands of dollars different depending on the 6th and 7th decimal

Um. That was the stupidest thing I’ve ever seen. And he did pop it, he popped it with a hammer after trying to use his fist, his foot, a banana, and a pineapple. How can this not be popped given that it popped?
If someone gave this to me as an impossible challenge I would get a knife, like the knife he “used” to open the packaging and then pop it.
I especially liked the part where he said had he used the scissors the video would be less than a minute long, invalidating his lame 9 minute video...
Edit: watched another. This is what is wrong with teens these days. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 17:40:10
Each one of us does this with each dollar invested in bitcoin.
