So far the only alternative to reddit is voat, however voat has been down since they cannon hold it. I am currently in the process of developing an alternative to reddit called speekit. We have opened beta tester applications for users to sign up and get involved with the site. The site is currently under development and we are working hard to push a release. You can visit our website [here]( fill out the beta tester application [here]( and follow us on twitter [here]( Speekit is all about getting the community's feedback when deciding to do something and we will allow almost all discussion as long at it isn't illegal or hateful.
If you have any feedback please comment below or pm me. Thank you!

1) I have heard of you only a couple of times but I didn't trust it.
2) Overall the product looks amazing, it seems very easy to use and it is nice for new users.
3) I haven't used the app a lot so I can't give a lot of information.
4) To get trust maybe you can get customers to review your app and possibly be as transparent as possible.

At the start the interest rate was 2% but not it is 5% as if someone does scam us we recoup it when people pay the 5% interest fee.
