I bid $1, Bob!

I've visited here once and really enjoyed the Dutch pancakes. Paid with bitcoin effortlessly with a waitress who knew what she was doing, although this was before any 10% discount was offered.

I was with you until you got all Biblical on me... book of revelations!?
@_date: 2014-12-29 04:41:11
Yes it's definitely a gamble, but I would equate it more to FOREX or stock trading than a game of poker or blackjack.

How about the YMCA?

What if the value of the USD were to crash due to the government being $18 trillion in debt?

You'll need to collect your tips on the changetip website soon or they will all be returned. My $6 tip is still showing "out for delivery" which means you haven't collected it yet. Let me know if you have any questions.

Well, in that case you can still use and take advantage of Bitcoin's features without buying and "hodling" it (such as with micro-tipping or international money transfer). Bitcoin as a currency could continue to appreciate in value over time vs fiat, but the past is no guarantee of future success and it's impossible to time the market.
The more I learn about Bitcoin, the more I want to buy and store for its current usefulness and future speculative value.

My thoughts exactly. He's old money and doesn't need to keep up with the latest tech. Here's 1000 bits @_date: 2014-12-28 05:30:28

Ditto. 3000 bits @_date: 2014-12-29 04:49:37
The ownership of the car and house keys can be linked to you on the blockchain, but that will only get you so far! It's wiser to move to a country where this stuff doesn't happen.
@_date: 2014-12-29 04:35:44
I think if a foreign government such as Russia were to seriously clamp down on bitcoin, the citizens would want it more and even pay a premium to turn in their paper money.

Looking forward to trying out the Nymi when the pre-order arrives! $2 @_date: 2014-12-29 05:06:39
Yes, that's definitely true. I was speaking about the future possibility with Bitcoin 2.0 technology where car engines could only start with the right digital ownership key as shown on the blockchain. If this actually becomes reality, it's still many years away I'm sure.
@_date: 2014-12-29 00:13:17
No problem, thanks for sharing!
@_date: 2014-12-29 04:09:14
Haha... I doubt that will ever happen. Still, if the government "steals" your wallet, you may as well limit their ability to spend it.
@_date: 2014-12-31 09:09:37
Exactly... why don't we call the 2008 US real estate bubble a "ponzi scheme" then? It's two different things! 1000 bits @_date: 2014-12-31 09:18:04
$1 Bob!

The collapse was due to the MCI WorldCom accounting scandal. Inventors were tricked into believing the company's profits were sound for many years before the truth came to light.
@_date: 2014-12-26 19:04:08
Very cool! upvote @_date: 2014-12-27 04:58:16
This is so true. $2 @_date: 2014-12-31 21:50:57
I'm not an owner or investor in Bitpay.

Thanks, Merry Bitmas to you as well!

How many other Americans could be doing just that and will be buying more after the New Year?
@_date: 2014-12-26 17:52:06
By the way, I immediately got downvoted for tipping your original funny photo. Don't know why someone would get so upset about giving you a tip for making my day.
@_date: 2014-12-26 17:41:56
I'm glad to see you're interested in learning more about Bitcoin and ChangeTip! Here's some more to spread the goodwill! $5 @_date: 2014-12-26 19:00:57
Just go to the ChangeTip website and link your Reddit account to it. You'll be able to collect your $8 there :)
You can choose to cash out the Bitcoin for US dollars or keep it in the ChangeTip wallet to share tips with others on Reddit, Twitter, Youtube, etc...
@_date: 2014-12-29 05:24:03
You could just set the car on fire... lol
@_date: 2014-12-29 05:36:46
You must be using an old school browser like Lynx ;)

Wait a minute, this comment smells of buttcoin...
@_date: 2016-06-07 07:01:24
No worries, and all is working now. Love the idea!
@_date: 2016-06-07 06:13:53
I sent two transactions that are now 10 and 12 hours old. Will you be able to get this resolved or do I need to post the transaction details?
@_date: 2016-06-08 00:35:23
How long until the website is updated? I posted a new transaction about 15 hours ago, but still nothing seen on the results page. Are you still having to process these manually?

Use Factom?

Todd, get out of the fucking photo!

Klaus Heissler, is that you?
@_date: 2017-07-29 09:04:25
Sorry but this is unwatchable

Thanks! :)

That's just the URL. The link to the live stream was posted in Aug 2010.

I appreciate your generosity! There's no reason why all charities shouldn't accept bitcoin, just give their management time to understand it.

This link works for me:
