My feedback: offer Payment On Arrival Option until you have gained reputation.

Yes it is ironic, isn't it.

Centralization and high transaction fees, especially after all the coins are mined and there's no more block reward.

I think most people make financial investments which they hope will outlive them and benefit their kids and grandkids. Whether people who are participating in this thread today will live to see the last coin mined or not is fairly irrelevant, IMO.

They are being pressured by regulators and in turn they are pressuring users, 2nd hand intimidation. People should not use any service that they feel is being invasive or not following constitutional law.

If all the fiat systems collapse...hmm...I would store rice and wheat. :)
I'm not sure who will be accepting bitcoin or gold if that happens.
Sugar, salt, pepper, spices. Herb, vegetable and fruit seeds.
Land. And chickens.

The possibility could also exist that he actually did invent Bitcoin, AND he is fraud. And Bitcoin was never meant to be anything but a ponzi. If that was the case, I wonder how many ppl would abandon bitcoin &amp; crypto...simply because it was not created with the elevated ideals that people assumed it was.
Just throwing out thoughts here, not saying this is true.

...Or he could be a cia black op agent. Bitcoin itself could have originated as a gov black op. There are a lot possibilities.
