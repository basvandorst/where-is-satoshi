Bitcoin records are created ONLY after mining. You can't simply create records on bitcoin network. That's the value of Bitcoin, security. Nobody can alter your transactions or create Bitcoins out of nothing.
I understand how money creation by central banks and govts works. But, the research talks  about money creation out of nothing by commercial banks.

Bitcoins do not comes from nowhere...they comes from mining, from electricity consumption, from electricity transformed in security. 
Money created by banks are just records in a computers system. Quite a big difference.

Completely wrong. No one will give value for your promise. No merchant will sell me a product or service because you promise me to pay me $100 in the future.

This website might be useful

Out of Wikipedia "The money supply of a country consists of currency (banknotes and coins) and, depending on the particular definition used, one or more types of bank money (the balances held in checking accounts, savings accounts, and other types of bank accounts). Bank money, which consists only of records (mostly computerized in modern banking), forms by far the largest part of broad moneyin developed countries"
They are money bro :) As long as we buys things, we are paid by employer , we pay employees using those banks numbers/records then they are money.

Why isn't enough cash ?! That's the biggest fraud of banks, they lends money they don't have...
@_date: 2018-02-20 17:00:47
Not only cash is money! There are different types of money: cash, central banks reserves, commercial banks money(loans, bank accounts). 
I know what fractional reserve is...the problem is that banks lends way too much money compared to deposits they have. If you go to a bank to borrow money don't expect the bank will wait for other person to make a deposit in order to lend you money. No, the bank will simply create you an account which is nothing than a number in a database. Basically the banks have the power to create new money(commercial banks money)!

That's very good news, mining decentralization

As long as, using a loan, I can buy a car, a house, a coffee etc it is money. Basically the banks created a new form of money. 
The banks are not restricted too much by fractional reserve, the only thing banks have to take care is to satisfy the everyday need of cash. 
What I have tried to say in the initial comment is that the loans/credits are not backed by other people cash. The banks simply lends money they don't have. That's why I consider it's  a fraud.

You can fork a github repository and make a new project. But you can't call the new project same as the forked project.
Regardless of which chain become most popular the new chain should be called whatever but not BTC/Bitcoin.
