Awesome! Your original comment plus years of horror stories turned me away from my checkout, but i am glad to see them follow through! This totally redeems them in my eyes as a bitcoin user and them focusing on the minority if needed.

I am sorry for the holder investors to gox.  No word in the English language can express it.  I see a lot of Phoenix's rising from these ashes looking to make up their losses and still coming out ontop once this cryptoevolution catches that first big hook.

Great AMA! I am never surprised by the snowball effect of Reddit.  May the ball keep rolling my friend!

Can somebody photoshop A. Antonopoulos face to B. Fraser face and add the BTC instead of the 3d on the title... instant Karma!
