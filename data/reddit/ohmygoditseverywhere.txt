Would love some insight on this as well.
If you have a balance of 0 on a channel, even if you have more btc in reserve somewhere, I don't understand how you would increase that balance without opening up another channel. On chain transaction fees are probably only going to be increasing over time. 
The only way I could think to increase your balance would be if someone else on the network paid you for something. 
Which now makes me wonder if it's possible for someone to pay you more than the total amount of btc that initiated the channel.

Hopeful people will buy btc in an attempt to profit, smart people run exchanges or sell mining equipment to ensure profit.
You only profit when you sell or spend crypto. Hopefully the smart people are doing more than just buying.

I think it was obvious that there would eventually be a correction, but I don't see how it was obvious that 20k would be the short term threshold. I'm open to learning which indicators/analysis produced that value.

It's weird because if you had the patience to read the entire post you would see that the OP agrees with you :(

When all bitcoin are mined, miners can still run to verify nee transactions. New bitcoin won't be minted, but they would still receive the transaction fees for the block.

So...who in that position wouldn't do the same?

It's annoying when people overestate their own abilities, or can't admit luck played in their favor. It's like due credit isn't being given. 
It's worse when there is enough evidence to convince their ego that they are right, and you are powerless to yank them into reality.

Just guessing, correct me if I'm wrong:
Assuming the mining fees increase to compensate for the lack of mined coins, the fees would still only be applied when settling the cumulative transactions of a LN channel on the blockchain. So instead of paying a fee for each transaction, you'd sort of be paying a fee distributed over a group of transactions.
Alternatively if miners choose not to mine because it's not affordable to do so, I think the mining difficulty would eventually decrease?

Are you taking mining fees into account? Or no? I'd agree that the person receiving btc will be getting the same value at transaction time, but the person buying with btc is looking at a pretty different price between btc and fiat right now.
I think most people don't understand your point about value at time of transaction being the same anyway. They just see the price charts and start seeing (missed) dollar signs or unrealized gains and make decisions based on that. I don't think most people would be on board for using their btc for purchasing G&amp;S until the price stabilizes, assuming it ever does. and I don't even mean flat-lining, even just being a fraction of current volatility levels could be enough to get people spending.

Selling an absurdly large volume of bitcoin would probably do the trick. Really hard to say how long the drop in price would last for or how far it would go, though.

I never said this wouldn't happen afterward, chill ��

Wealth solves many problems, but then creates many others. Rich people still kill themselves. I don't know if it fixes almost everything, it might just be a different state.
