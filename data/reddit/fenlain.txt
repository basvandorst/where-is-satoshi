Yeah I noticed that too, it was 'up' but everything was hyper-delayed, buy/sell orders were getting rejected, etc.

Assuming each 680 gets ~120 MH/s, you'd have a total of (obviously) 240 MH/s. At a conservative 400 W power draw, with power at $0.12 per KW/h, you'd stand to lose $34.55 per month mining bitcoin. That'd put your net annual profit at $-420.00 per year. 
If your cards are 4gb you could mine Ethereum with them. Otherwise, no, bitcoin mining hasn't been profitable on GPUs for nearly five years.

I was wondering that myself, the trade are all super small (0.001 btc) which doesn't seem to be impacting the overall volume at all. It almost seems reminiscent of a DDoS.

Hate to break it to you, but GPU+CPU mining wasn't viable five years ago.

Never have heard that term, actually.

"The Facebook of Crypto" sounds like something you could pitch to anyone in silicon valley and have a good chance of investors biting.

Thinking like that won't get you anywhere. Otherwsie, why not slap yourself for not buying $15k worth of BTC back in January @ $800? After all, you'd have 18.75 BTC which would be worth  $135,850 right now. No one has a crystal ball, and you didn't lose any money. Mine away.

How's that for a slice of fried gold?

Can't do anything about it now, if you think it was a mistake then don't make the same mistake again. That's about the best you can do at this point.

5700! Was convinced I'd wake up today with btc down by another $1k because I bought more, was pleasantly surprised.

Create the dip, then buy the dip.

Expedia takes Bitcoin as well, if you're looking for an established company.
