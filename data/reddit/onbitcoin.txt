Charlie: I want to bite some coin.
Mac: What?
Charlie: You know, coin. Bite some coin.
Dennis: Do you mean Bitcoin?
Charlie: Yeah, yeah, bitecoin. How do I get some?
Dennis: Jesus. Okay Charlie, let's try an analogy. What's your favorite food? 
Charlie: Milksteak.
Dennis: Milksteak. What the hell is milksteak? Nobody knows what milksteak is. Let's try something else. What's your favorite hobby? 
Charlie: Magnets.
Dennis: Magnets? What do you mean, making magnets, collecting magnets?
Charlie: Just magnets.
Dennis: Okay fine, magnets. How do you get magnets?
Charlie: Well, I can find them.
Mac: You mean steal them?
Charlie: No, I mean find them in a cave or deep cavern!
Dennis: Like mine them? Yes, sure, you can mine magnets. How else?
Charlie: Well, I suppose I could buy them.
Mac: As a last alternative.
Dennis: Yes, you can buy them. You would give someone dollars and they would give you magnets.
Charlie: (pause) Okay, I see.
Dennis: And what can you do with these magnets once you have mined them or bought them?
Charlie: Lots of things! 
Dennis: That's right. Lots of things.
TL:DR- Bitcoins are like Charlie's Magnets. You can mine them or buy them, and do lots of things with them.
