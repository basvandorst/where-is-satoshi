Reminds me of the Cryptsy-coin... like, entirely.

When MtGox crashed, we were angry. I was angry, lost 0.2btc and ended up missing the class action deal where people were getting money back. Oh well.
I mined most of my coin back in the day, sold 99% of it off, unfortuantely, as money was tight. Had I hodl all of what I had, I'd be a tens of thousands-aire. Yet again, oh well. 
I'm still in for the long run, though, even if I don't have much cash in the game - at least I'm running a full node, helping to keep the blockchain stable. That's all I care for anyway.
These days, I only mine Gridcoin and, if prices are decent, sell it back for btc. I believe in bitcoin over any of the alt coins that have sprung up like weeds in the grass.

I came here to say this too. Every time I see this 'adblock' phony on friend's machines, I guide them to use ABP instead. 100% of the time, they thank me later on because 'it actually blocks all the ads!'. 
Who'dathunk'it, an adblocker that blocks ads!
And no, I'm not a developer of adblockplus, and not involved in their community whatsoever - I'm just a user, and have been since the very first version of the extension/addon.

Pretty sure he said something along the lines of "piles of bit".

Here's to a Trump victory! Not only because of potential BTC :P

Ideally, you shouldn't be using those 2003 boxes for browsing the web, let alone using them as clients.

Yes, at least according to the official lifecycle chart -

Good bot

This is a blatant advertisement for a TV show, not necessarily bitcoin.
edit: sorry. early in the morning and my brain wasn't fully awake yet. I'm leaving this here but downvoting myself.

And then, after careful decision, the cat will eat his face.

Don't buy; mine. I've got two radeon 6850's configured with cgminer to mine around 0.3btc a day, which at the current going rate is around $42/day minus power costs, of course. Once I have some extra cash, I'll probably try getting an asic.
Right now, the potential is there for this to be an interesting money making platform, but I expect that eventually it will cost more to get into it all than it'll be worth.

obviously put it through the wash a few times, then move it to multiple paper wallets with varying amounts, and keep a handful in warm storage for trading. It makes more sense to put in money than take it out at this stage of the game.

Seems like another way to extort money from their customers...
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:16:17
I didn't sell, but I did spend some btc on bitcoinstore, for a new KVM switch. I believe in bitcoin - specifically the aspect that offers us a universal currency that doesn't get taxed an upteenth time. I don't have much money as it is, but I do believe that bitcoin is the future of money, and will stick with it (and keep mining).

Wow, I'm surprised to see that the local branch is literally only 30 minutes away from where I live... Looks like it may make some bitcents to bank there.

All stories have a kernel of truth - this one, in particular, shows how useful bitcoin is, and how much of a perv the OP is.
@_date: 2013-03-26 09:28:08
So give us a rundown of sites that could be more useful than the Gox. I've been using Gox since they fucked up and got hacked, and sent out yubikeys to all compromised accounts - as such, I don't have much faith in them, but cannot seem to find an exchange that is reputable enough.

KERNING! Won't someone please think of the kerning!

You all get upvotes. except the unhelpful twat. Even on small deposits, I've had issues with mtgox (less than $100), taking anywhere from 3-14 days.
@_date: 2013-08-21 22:22:53
why did you sell low? I'm gonna ride it out and see if their market share goes up with the second gen chips.

This is the only podcast related to technology that I bother to listen to - lots of awesome information, presented in a great format. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 08:00:55
I'm helping the market by using my btc to purchase a well-needed dvi/usb kvm switch from bitcoinstore.
Let's hope the price keeps climbing!

You're awesome. Restoring a lot of people's faith in the mission that bitcoin is pushing. I've heard stories of your generosity, from all over reddit and elsewhere  - if anything, you've restored my faith in the generosity of complete strangers. 
To the OP, the high res image is great, but perhaps if you added a bit of noise to the texture you're using for the gold, it may add a bit more luster and dimension to the coins. Also, what's written on the sides of some of the coins?
