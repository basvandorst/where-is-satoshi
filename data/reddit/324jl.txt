Sides of a proposal debate, are sides.


Should be this way, yes. But a lot of people oppose NYA only because Jihan supports it.


I agree, except for a blocksize increase. A blocksize increase has been needed for too long, and had almost unanimous support at one time. 


What screwed it up was segwit.

148 was a hardfork, when you orphan any block that isn't segwit, and you don't (you didn't) have the majority of the hashrate, that's a hardfork.

2 miners have ~48% of the hashpower each, wait until the difficulty change, there will be more. Then it will be decentralized. Hashpower follows the money. I am worried that most miners will mine cash until it's diff. goes up, then go back to core, then wait for another diff. change, and on and on. This could get interesting while waiting for them to level out.
@_date: 2017-08-02 00:14:30
LOL because it was a compromise! So for the last 5.5 hours BCC has a 40 minute block time over 8 blocks, and BTC has a 13.6 min. block time over 24 blocks. Added together that's a ~10.2 min. block time! Be smart here: If your segwitcoin is only 3/4 of the network (which it looks like) and you add the current prices for both together (2710+390=3100). Then the hashpower implied price is BCC 775 BTC 2325.

I'm not doing anything but holding both.


There you go putting words in my mouth again. I have not told you to stop running core, do what you want. What I am saying is that core's unwillingness to accept the will of the majority of the network, will create another fork of the chain, and in my opinion core will have the least use out of the three chains. This could be avoided very easily if they would just accept the blocksize increase that they were initially in support of: 
**We would have 4 Megabyte blocks right now if Adam Back's proposal was accepted**

I'm not trying to stop it. I'm holding both so it doesn't matter to me which one wins, or if they tie. Combined market cap is now $51 Billion, $3 Billion higher than bitcoin ever had. Add in all the coins that are lost on BOTH chains, and they're both worth A LOT more!

So with 2 hours per block and 5-8 Megabytes of transactions per hour, everything will be fine? No, in Just one day there will be 100-200 Megabytes of backlog. A 200 Mb mempool will bring average fees to something like 1000 Sat./Byte. So over $10 fee for a basic transaction. The one I made from a multi-sig that had 4 inputs, would be .012 BTC fee, or $50 at current BTC price.
That's just the first 24 hours, assuming people will still be trying to use it. (Except to get their BTC on exchange so they can dump it, they won't)

the way I understand it, the transaction is hashed differently in BCC it's highly unlikely, but it might still be possible, but there will at the very least need to be some changes to the code of the multisig recovery tool in order to accomplish this.

Then how do you determine where support is in a pseudonymous, sybil attack resistant way that will work internationally? If it's decided by nodes, I can just spin up 1000's of nodes, If it's by IP address I can just create a bot-net and spin up 1000's of nodes. If it's done by Bitcoin address balance, then only the Bitcoin rich have a say.
What is the way you would determine consensus?

@_date: 2017-08-18 18:06:38
I'm not a mathematician but I think it will look something like this:
Once the fees reach a certain point the will be barely any use, until hashpower comes back, or difficulty adjustment, or hardfork, then it will empty out and start the whole process all over again when the hashpower switches back.
Edit: So the mempool will grow sub-linearly, while the fees grow exponentially. At some point they will be too much, and the whole thing collapses.

BTER.com works, I actually had some dash on there for over a year that I forgot about and it was still there when I took it out a month ago, but had to verify ID (passport) to get it out. Support was fast, usually no more than 1 day. Not sure when they are going to accept BCC deposit though.

You seem to really like putting words in other people's mouths. If you're so worried about replay protection, why don't you ask core to put it in too? 
As said:


Seeing as how 2X arguably has a lot of support, why don't you ask core for replay protection? If one side won't then the other side should, because if neither side does, everyone will just go to the cash chain.

Coinbase **and it's users** are fighting the IRS for trying to collect information on all of its accounts, and John Doe 4 has made some small wins so far.

It doesn't matter what something "opens" at.  I could start a new crypto and make the first trade to myself for 10,000, doesn't mean that's what it's worth. The market decides, and since the market opened everyone who thought it would fail sold at any price, once they're out of the market they have no influence on price. Look at what happened with snapchat's IPO, with a whole bunch of hype it opened high, but then just kept going down and has yet to have any significant rally  . If BCH was worth $1, It would be going down towards $1. If you think it was worth $1 and it goes up $5, you're going to sell as soon as you can. That there are people willing to pay $500+ for over a day at record volume means there are enough people with money to support this price level. You don't understand how markets work.

If you're for collaboration, and 2X doesn't move the needle much, then why do you support kicking 90+% of miners off the network? Why don't you keep them as core supporters by just including 2X in an emergency upgrade? Surely everyone knows how to upgrade software in a timely manner? It's only a few lines of code, no? Shouldn't big economic nodes with custom implementations just be able to add your trusted code to their implementations?

It's not even about that, 95% Is a lot healthier for these kinds of batteries than taking them to 100%. Also, the way most phones charge, they usually trickle charge once the get to 100% full. I don't have the time but you could look up the intricacies of Li-ion batteries if you're really interested, only a really big deal with laptop batteries anyway as they tend to crap out when they're still technically 95% good. By design, so they can sell more of these expensive things, they'll just not attempt to charge if the voltages are off between the cells inside, probably also for liability reasons.

No. If BCH becomes double the value of BTC, you could swap your half a BTC for .25 BCH, then you'd have .75 BCH.
Said another way, If they become worth the same on an exchange you can trade one for the other and have 2x the amount of the other, or 1 whole.
Right now if you had .5 BTC at the fork block, you now have .5 BTC + .5 BCH.
At current prices you have 4200+600=4800, 4800/2=2400

No, but there is a lot of support for 2X:

* 83.28% of hashing power
* 5.1 billion USD monthly on chain transaction volume
* 20.5 million bitcoin wallets

It's not theft, it's people losing their coins by not understanding properly that sending coins that are on both chains, on one chain, can be replayed on the other chain. You'd be protected if you sent them to new (separate) addresses on both chains, before making a transaction with someone else. Yes, it's annoying, but it's not rocket science.
@_date: 2017-08-18 06:08:39
I agree, and that's why I have both.
@_date: 2017-08-21 06:04:19
I'm saying why is it contentious if he was originally supporting a hard fork? If core supported the hard fork it wouldn't be contentious. Even with core's support, non-2X doesn't have near enough support, and the chain will be effectively dead. With a few holdouts (Right now only slush pool, with around 6-7%) mining 1.5 hour+ on average blocks, there is no need for replay protection, because the chain will not be viable without it's own hardfork. You're delusional if you think the core chain will survive a 90% hashpower drop.

That actually does make sense, why couldn't anyone say this earlier? The developers shouldn't have a policy on these things either. They should just objectively present the facts on proposed changes and poll the miners. Then the miners vote based on hashing power. Wasn't this the original idea?
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:48:10
It would be nice if EVERYONE who has BCH moved their coins in some way. Then we would be able to determine how many coins have actually been lost. This would increase the price of both coins.

And what went wrong with this?:
@_date: 2017-08-18 06:04:48


I've seen plenty of hard-forks go down successfully. We just had a group (so far) successfully hard fork off this chain with much more complicated code than just a blocksize adjustment.
You mean recommissioning, right?


That's why I suggested that core write their own code to achieve this, why can't this happen?
@_date: 2017-09-06 04:56:46


But the next difficulty change is only going to be ~5%+. Even if the extra hashpower leaves BTC will still have sub-10 min. block times.
An interesting point I would like to add is that most of the extra hash power is coming from BTC.TOP and F2pool, which recently had a spat over the NYA.
Another possibility is that since the block aren't full, they are being mined faster. As you can see a bunch of the smaller miners have also gained mining market share. Actually now that I look at it, the only pools that seem to have lost more than a variance of the share of hashpower are AntPool and SlushPool.

What if you just keep the block headers and utxo set?
@_date: 2017-07-28 06:06:36
Technically, yes. The multisig gives you private seeds to a HDM wallet. (A collection of addresses, every time you send BTC into it, it goes to a new address, could lead to some high fees real quick) With their recovery tool you can check your balances and make a transaction with a fee you set. I imagine you can broadcast the tx on both chains but i'm not sure, safer to move your balance to a paper wallet I would think. See my other posts if you have more questions.

Well, a lot of the speculators moved to ETH around the time of that drop, so I think it's from less people using Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-07-28 05:29:36
**If you want a near-instant transaction from coinbase:**
Set up a muti-sig vault, send your BTC from GDAX  to coinbase wallet (Whatever your daily limit is however many days it takes,) then to your multi-sig vault. (Each transaction to your multi-sig is an ON-CHAIN transaction to a new address in the wallet, so don't create a lot of inputs! 4in 1out was about 1250 bytes for me). Then **you can send it wherever you want for whatever fee you want** with their recovery tool. I did that transaction for a few cents when the mempool was empty last weekend. Just **make sure you print the page with all the seeds or you'll be SOL!**
EVERY time you send to the multi-sig it sends to a new address in the HDM (hierarchical deterministic) wallet, so the more times you send to that wallet the more fees you'll have to pay to get it out. Send 4 times and you'll have a ~1200 byte tx.
1200*(lets say congested so 200 sat./b) = .0024 BTC fee
@_date: 2017-07-31 19:01:11
Yeah, it seems they've been having to get more out of cold storage. I'm not sure if you can get the BCC from the vault, but you may be able to replay the transaction on both networks, as the recovery tool spits out a transaction that you can verify here  or elsewhere. You can also broadcast it to the BTC network. Not sure how to broadcast a transaction to BCC network, maybe start a new thread with your questions?
Edit: If I had time I'd pay the fee and get it out, but that's just me.

I honestly don't know, it's hard to find documentation on the size of multisig tx inputs, it would probably be a little less that 2100 though (assuming 1 output address). Inputs will be the majority of the transaction's size, then there is a set amount for the rest of the size.
Based on my tx is estimate 257 or 258 per input and 190 for the rest, but I could be wrong, it could be like 260+ per input.
Here's what a block with 7 multisig inputs (the size of the ones made by coinbase, iv'e seen smaller) and 2 outputs looks like: 
 
A block with 9 in 1 out:

@_date: 2017-07-24 23:24:57
Did you try this? 
I've only done a 2/3 multi-sig from coinbase, but it was easy because it gave a printout all the seeds, one encrypted with a password.
Maybe more info here?

@_date: 2017-07-26 14:41:33
Fair enough, maybe it was just over 1, like 1.01 per byte. I do think that some pools actively block tx's that are under a certain amount of fee. I got 1 through on the weekend with a 1sat. per byte fee, ~1200 byte transaction, but the mempool was literally empty. Could also be that your transaction was very small so it was accepted before those 5.8kB tx's
@_date: 2017-07-24 22:34:59
**To set your own fee:**
Set up a muti-sig vault, send your BTC to coinbase wallet (Whatever your daily limit is however many days it takes,) then to your multi-sig vault. (Each transaction to your multi-sig is an ON-CHAIN transaction to a new address, so don't create a lot of inputs. 4in 1out was about 1200 bytes for me). Then you can send it wherever you want for whatever fee you want with their recovery tool. I did that transaction for a few cents when the mempool was empty last night. Just make sure you print the page with all the seeds or you'll be SOL!
EVERY time you send to the multi-sig it sends to a new address in the HDM (hierarchical deterministic) wallet, so the more times you send to that wallet the more fees you'll have to pay to get it out. Send 4 times and you'll have a ~1200 byte tx.
1200*(lets say congested so 200 sat./b) = .0024 BTC fee
Edit: you can probably get away with a 2 sat./byte fee right now as all the large transactions shown here  are 1 sat./byte as shown here:  (scroll down, and see the following pages, there's more than 20 pages of the 5.8 kb tx's with 1 sat./byte fee)
@_date: 2017-07-28 06:10:39
It doesn't matter how much Bitcoin, it matters how many inputs. (In this case how many times you sent money to the multisig wallet, I suggest you do more research on bitcoin transactions and fees)

Tx link or it didn't happen, there's 20 megabytes of unconfirmed tx's:
You can see here there are over 500 tx's that are 5.8 kilobytes with 1.00 sat/B tx fee:
 
@_date: 2017-07-25 06:36:19
They are seeds to a HDM wallet.
I can confirm that the recovery tool works, and you can use it to check your balance before you set the fee for the transaction, the fee is total fee. **Every deposit** goes to a different address in the wallet! So for me 4 inputs to 1 output was ~1200 b so make sure you set the proper fee.
Edit: I just saw that this it 17 hours old but appeared at the top of my "new" page. I don't think new accounts can be seen by everyone either.
@_date: 2017-07-24 08:17:31
AFAIK you can't avoid the limit from GDAX (trading market with 0% market maker fees) to Coinbase, but there are no limits or fees when putting BTC in the multi-sig (though they do pay 200 sat./b from their own pocket), the tool they give you can run offline and it will spit out a tx. that you can broadcast on the network so I assume you could broadcast it to either network. EVERY time you send to the multi-sig it sends to a new address in the HDM (hierarchical deterministic) wallet, so the more times you send to that wallet the more fees you'll have to pay to get it out. Send 4 times and you'll have a ~1200 byte tx.     
1200*(lets say congested so 200 sat./b) = .0024 BTC fee
@_date: 2017-07-24 05:46:50
I'm not sure but a ($) daily limit applies when moving BTC from GDAX to Coinbase. Just found that out when I withdrew, but the good thing is that you don't have to wait a full day if you're just over the limit. It will update every few seconds. (so after 1 hour you'll have 1/24th your daily limit available again, and so on.)

Well, if you look at the chart in the first link I shared, you can make a reasonable judgement of what the fee should be to get through. Right now it would be around 30, but there's usually a spike around 4-5 hours from now (noon EDT). If you look back on the chart  most of the month of may you would have needed 160-260.

Looking back at the transactions it was nearly instant last week. Friday and Saturday around 5 minutes and 1 was like an hour. If I had to guess, however long it takes for coinbase's 220 satosi/byte fee to get confirmed. The good thing is that they pay the fee when they/you put it in the vault, and you pay the fee when you want to take it out.
@_date: 2017-07-26 04:36:00
What I was saying is that the pool BTCC has been mining half full blocks, contributing to higher fees across the network recently.
Is this what you mean?: 
The mempool probably got smaller because of less use, people have been speculating that it's because the blocksize limit is too small, or that it's a seasonal thing. But someone is still spamming the network with large low fee transactions, probably a mixing service.
