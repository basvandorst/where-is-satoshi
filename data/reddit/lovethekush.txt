Can someone explain to me why you wouldn't store your coins on the card?

Weird. I always remembered that PayPal treats the buyer better than they treat the seller. Stopped using it because it isn't even fast, I'd have to wait a week before my deposit shows up on the account. Paying by credit or visa debit is definitely much easier

It’s actually like 96% effective if you do it properly

Doing something properly is basically following instructions. Sometimes, no matter how correctly you do something there may be external factors involved that are outside your control. You can do something 100% the way you’re supposed to (properly) and still have something go wrong. The more you know.,,

This movie was great but this part bothered me. If 1 day there is 7 years on earth then shouldn’t they age 7 years within a day?

So being near the black hole slows their entire metabolism/biological clock way down? I see, so shouldn’t they be moving super slow? Because they seemed to be moving normally

So time slowing down = body slowing down as well, that’s the only way it makes sense to me. And if their experience of time stays the same that means they are thinking super slow as well? If that’s not it then I still don’t get it lol
