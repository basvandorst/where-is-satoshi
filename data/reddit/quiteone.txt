I bet I am not the only one who wants to chop Karpelas' head off and throw it to a pool filled with Star-fucking-bucks coffee. 
Failing a business is OK but hiding the truth and lying to investors is unacceptable...

Yes it is down for me as well, but I still see trades happening... Maybe just Bots

I have never tried to withdraw large amounts but, in their site it says: "Large withdrawals will be processed manually. This process will take up to 24 hours."

If you can name me one one large, recognized charity organization that accepts Bitcoin to help these families quickly, I'll remove this post and move it there. However, disasters have no rules and this post will stay here despite the community rules.

To me, throwing his head to a coffee pool is nothing but a pure fantasy of course, however it is a fact that Bitcoin community has also some dangerous criminals that trade guns, hardcore drugs, etc.. And if you piss them off, the sky is the limit about what they can do to him..

It is a big amount of bid at a specific price, but called "buy wall" in Bitcoin community.

If I was a Gox customer I wouldn't be joking. I am angry because they have dropped Bitcoin's reputation to the floor. 
They have caused %30-50 price drop in exchange market.
Market manipulation: Someone please explain ~5k Sell order 24th Feb at Bitstamp, one hour before when crash has been forming..
I have lost thousands... I am still holding it, and will be holding. However these kind of assholes need to be in prison.

If you think those miners ever heard of Bitcoin, you must be extremely ignorant. If you can read it right they make $2/h that they can't even afford a computer or a smart phone...
This is a great opportunity to help and promote Bitcoin. You greedy trolls think everything is a scam.

I have edited that statement. After thinking about your comment, I agree that investing in Bitcoin in both ways help it to expand. But manipulation is still an issue. Thanks.
