Bitcoin is a store of value and not meant to buy pizza with. I would stick to paypal or creditcard for that.

A way Russia can escape sanctions.. I am not suggesting that Bitcoin should be regulated but maybe a trustworthy company such as Blockstream could make sure that transactions from Russia, Iran, NorthKorea and other countries under embargo could be kicked out of the mempool? Can LN block certain transactions?

We should all trust and move on to SamouraiWallet as thanks for their Segwit support!

Yes you do, otherwise you are not part of the real bitcoin community. I offered to give all my bcash away for free on this forum since I want nothing to do with that scamcoin, unfortunately the post was automoderated and removed immedeately since it mentioned an altcoin.

F..k stripe! We should all boycott them :(
@_date: 2018-01-02 07:26:54
Nope, its Roger the bastards fault. Bitcoin has been under attack since August and need to strike back!
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:03:48
Wow! Such a cool meme!
I hope BTC bottoms out at 5000, then I will buy lots more!

No2X, No scaling. LN will solve these problems! Don't you understand???
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:41:45
Segwit and now LN will drive it upp again over 20 000 in a few months.
@_date: 2018-01-23 06:54:45
Of course, LN will save Bitcoin from all ripoffs!
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:59:29
We must stop the spamattacks on Bitcoin now! 
Can't we report Bitpay and Coinbase and all other companies that are anti segwit and bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:52:56
NO2X! (or bigger blocks)
Haven't you learned anything these last months?

Bitcoin is not supposed to be used for transactions but for hodling and store of value. There are way better ways for transactions than Bitcoin. Just use a creditcard instead.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:52:46


You realise that you are in absolute minority here on this sub for saying that? Troll! Go to /btc and spread your fud there!
@_date: 2018-03-13 06:27:46
Until LN is fully implemented in all wallets and all business have LN channels Bitcoin is not meant to be used as a day to day currency. Its better as a store of value.
HODL on to that Lambo! :)

Who cares what they think?
We should boycott Gemini since the twins are anti Bitcoin when they said they will support b*ash on their exchange :(
@_date: 2018-03-09 07:51:56
No, its not mtgox fault. Its Roger the Scammer and his attempt to hijack Bitcoin that are causing this :(
@_date: 2018-03-09 11:51:34
Well, if you just hodl it you might be able to buy a beachfront house AND your sailboat after the summer when Bitcoin bounces back!
@_date: 2018-03-09 08:28:31
That 500 will be worth atleast 5000 this summer when LN is implemented so just HODL it! 
@_date: 2018-03-16 07:08:58
They are just as happy as we are when bcash crashes!
@_date: 2018-03-28 09:32:17
We should all boycott reddit :( 
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:53:03
Don't worry, as soon as LN is implemented it will go back to 20 000! :) To the moon! 
@_date: 2018-02-06 07:04:39
No multicrypto, don't trade with shitcoins. Stick to BTC and you will be rich in the future :)
@_date: 2018-02-08 06:54:02
Its gonna be as big as the Internet is in 10-15 years. Everybody will know about Bitcoin. Segwit, LN and Blockstream will be as famous as Amazon,Microsoft and Apple in the future, belive me on that one.
@_date: 2018-04-03 06:46:30
We should all just boycott them since they are antibitcoin. There are better wallets out there.
