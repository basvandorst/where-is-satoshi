Welcome to NY the nanny state which I can't wait to get out of. If you really want to destroy bitcoin with your ridiculous regulations just let Governor Cuomo make up the rules. That asshole is great at fucking everything up. Politics + Cryptocurrency = the demise of everything cryptocurrency stands for. 
NY's overpowered political agenda is disgusting. Any revenue you receive will be wasted on overspending for useless shit meanwhile people struggle just to live here. So keep your hands off of it.

Unfortunately now that he has declared bankruptcy, he is protected and doesnt have to share any information. Good for him bad for investors and the community.

I agree. You hit the nail on the head!

Your just as crooked as the ones who stole the funds. (Whether it was Karpeles or an outside job) When records are produced and they see your claim but none of your info. You should be sitting in prison next to the assholes who stole the money, if they ever catch them. Those poor people that lost their life savings should be able to stone the mother fuckers who did this.
( IMHO I think it was an Inside job.)

This could be good news. Or this is where Mtgox shuts their doors. Sorry but Charlie Scherms words of wisdom to Mark probably werent the best advice, given his circumstances.

Yes you are right about the courts. I should have rephrased my comment.
@_date: 2014-03-03 12:04:46
Thanks. Appreciate the info.

Now Now! I am calm. If I actually had money in gox you would see me not calm. But thankfully I did not.

Karpeles. He's the crook. With that much $. He can hire the best lawyers. He may beat the law but I doubt he'll beat the "elite individuals" who had money there who are very, very angry.

Haha I still know people like that and im in my 30's. Sad thing is their older.
