You told me to post once more
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:47:44
You can now. And if you can't delete tomorrow
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:35:29
Why you tell me please leave? I am not mad but it's strange. I wish you all the best in your life
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:16:47
Heads of the community promised me they would leave me alone if I showed them that enough from one trader. I just need traders opinion
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:01:11
I just want opinion from other traders. That's all
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:24:44
Sorry that is misspelling "enough"
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:52:33
I can say but they don't listen. You will never know what is to work for 50 people if you don't work for 50 people. You are a good man. You want to help and I appreciate it. I wish you a good life. I am now in a proces of deleting my account
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:09:25
I live with people who don't understand crypto. And I don't know others people opinion. I love others opinion. You don't?
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:14:16
They want more. And I can't make more. I work 16h every day. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:49:07
Why you don't tell your opinion please
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:09:07

We live in some kind of community where is 50 people but no one knows nothing about crypto. All these people are making me work harder. But I can't to keep up. All that people live with my money becouse we are community. I need others people opinion to prove that is inaf from me
