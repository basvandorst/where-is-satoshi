Long story short is your client needs to download the blockchain which is the public record of transactions on the Bitcoin network. Depending on the speed of your PC and Internet this can take some time.  This is normal for new installs. Let the client sync up and your transaction should show up, as long as the correct address was used by the sender.

So by this definition alone, all previous hard forks in Bitcoin Core have created alternate alt coin chains. 
By this argument alone, all previous hard forks are wrong. And since Core was the heart of those, Core is wrong. 
Fork Core.  
My hope is Classic will implement the performance improvements from Core 0.12, which doesn't need a hard fork to implement.

Unlimited to the static capability of max block size. That is 32mb if I recall the Satoshi implementation originally.  BU just removed the engine limiter. 
I'm good with segwit, but think the long term is removal of the limiter.  
But even IF the limiter was removed that does not mean all blocks magically are 32mb in size today. Proof? Look at the first blocks before the 1mb limit was introduced. 
Let bitcoin scale as it was intended, and fix the issues that need to be fixed. Let's do both.

So 4000 max transactions per 10 mins is what we should stick with?  Or with the segwit functionality maybe 12000?
You propose not a fee market but off-chain hyperbole. Bitcoin as not a store of value or a what? A random data store transaction distributed on a massive scale?

Perhaps so, but that one block just about cleans the mempool. We’re stilling waiting for the BTC mempool to clear from this weekends fiasco, transaction volume aside.

Best non-Internet facsimile I could think of. Moving money on the Internet should be faster, not on-par or slower with their real-world counterparts.

Other than the transactions exist?  No.   Calling it spam is disingenuous. Excessive low fees? Maybe, but they are still transactions. It’s up to the miners to determine what they will put in a block. Not enough fees?  Some other miner will compete for it. 
This “it’s Spam” has got to stop. There’s already plenty of fee happy transactions which are stuck in limbo.  Segwit hasn’t fixed the problem.  Yes I know segwit adoption has been slow, and honesty slower then it should have been considering the hoopla and time to market. 
Yes, most of the bitcoin hashrate is pumping BCH, and it’s not helping. But consider the average block on BTC isn’t filling more than 2300 transactions isn’t helping either. 
And yes I have a measly .01 BTC transaction I purposely set with low fees to an exchange. I figured several hours, sure. However it’s going beyond that in hurry. If adoption == utilization, then speed of transactions should be measured at most in hours, not dozen++ of hours. 
It’s getting to the point where it would be faster to snail mail a check with next day air priority.  And cheaper. 
This is not the bitcoin vision I saw 3 years ago.

Sleep?  You’re obviously doing it wrong.

Speaking of, where are good places to invest your BTC? And more specifically, why?
@_date: 2015-02-03 11:36:34
Probably a skiddie who thinks that doing some kind of amplification attack qualifies as a DOS vuln. ERMEGERD! PERKETS!
Apparently the nugget doesn't understand how Bitcoin works.  
All that for:  Pics (vid) or it didn't happen.

The price is tanking simply because people are selling BTC, and others are buying at the lowest possible price.  Since Coinbase's exchange came online, this has increased the visibility of BTC to a much larger "pool" of investors, if you will.  These new folks are buying it as cheap as possible NOW.  
Will it go back up?  Most likely. Where is the bottom?  Who knows. 
The only people making money really is the large mining factories, the mining hardware companies, and the cloud-mining mini-corps.  
Because when you can state "We are 'disabling' the service because of the volatility in the price", what you're really saying "We're not going to pay you, we're keeping the money."  Because the global hashrate hasn't changed, really.
So, price be damned.  If you mine to make money, you're doing it wrong.  You mine to make BTC, and use it like money.

I had a brief moment about 30 mins ago where I got _ONE_ page.  Then a click later... it was gone.
bitcointalk may be flooded with scammers, The Stupid, and misinformation, but there are genuine moments of pure clarity in there.

That said, if wants an honest review from the community to validate the product to the mining community and provide honest feedback, please let me know.  
@_date: 2015-02-06 11:42:03
I didn't claim to represent the community.  I am of the community.  I only claim that I would provide an honest review and feedback.
Does anyone have an idea who I am?  Probably not.  But, you have to start somewhere. Or are we saying we have a set number of "representatives" and we will not tolerate anyone else?

Compile it from source.  The instructions, once you read through, make sense and it's easy.  Once you have a local git clone of the 0.10 branch, and the necessary prerequisites for compiling (all in the documentation), you can create a script that does it for you:
cd ~/bitcoin
git pull
sudo make install
sudo strip /usr/local/bin/bitcoind
sudo strip /usr/local/bin/bitcoin-cli
sudo strip /usr/local/bin/bitcoin-tx
sudo strip /usr/local/bin/test_bitcoin
bitcoin-cli stop
