what is the relationship between cryptocurrency values and blockchain?  (outside the usage for its intended purpose as an anonymous currency, for which mostly it is a poor usage for due to the significant volitility in price).  
As I see it, blockchain is a technology that enables crypto. blockchain is where the value is at. crypto is an implementation of blockchain - and there is no link between the value of blockchain and the value of any particular cryptocurrency.  anyone can reproduce a blockchain, and rather than use a coin / token to incentivise people to maintain the network, it could be a requirement to participate in the network (ie: for large scale data storage solutions).

This is an extremely good question. I've asked myself how cash settled futures on such a scarce good will affect the underlying price.  
What CAN happen is that if somone with deep pockets has a very large futures position, they can 'force' the price down/up to close so they are profitable on the trade.  (this commonly happens with equities, when several types of derivatives will trend towards 'max pain' levels  towards the 'triple witching hour'). Since there is only a small number of BTC out there (and most of them presumably are retail traders), only a small amount of BTC traded can have a huge effect on the price (ie: 400 btc in any one direction can move it 5-10%).. while 400 x 17k sounds like alot of money - if you have a large enough futures position (1000 contracts) it is chump change.  
Its hard to say whether this is 'good' or 'bad' - it just makes it an easily manipulated tool for investors with deep pockets... I would expect to see the volatility increase (rather than parobolic increase, tehre will be similar amounts of volatility but with ups and downs)

You are contradicting yourself...
why is a crash in the stock market any different from a crash in crypto if you are HODL? you haven't realized your losses if you didnt sell.

Not sure if you are serious.. but if you are - what are the most important aspect you would want in something that is a good store of value? How about something that is a good speculative investment?

also... 
this reason:
\&gt; Can't have its supply flooded by arbitrarily easy means of production. Check. 
is why you will never have this:
\&gt; Potential world reserve currency with a now couple hunned bill in market cap.... Check.

OP, are you arguing that BTC is a good store of value or a good speculative investment, because it can't be both.

Lol, im asking for your thoughts, not for a marketing line and talking points for BTC fanbois they see replicated everywhere.
What most people want in a good store of value is something that wont drop 50% (or rise 50%) in value over 1 year.. which is what makes a good speculative investments. They are diametrically opposed.

How does the market cap of BTC have any relationship to the 9T lost by the reserve? Its like saying I have 8 oranges and there are 200 apples on the tree.

Inflation - Its a feature, not a bug.
