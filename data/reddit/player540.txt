Pro trader on localbitcoins normally works.
@_date: 2015-06-15 02:48:07
or just use localbitcoins to do the same thing lol.
@_date: 2015-06-02 03:04:34
Wow BTCChina sound really professional. 
P.S. Fuck okcoin!
@_date: 2015-06-11 06:27:45
wtf... and to think these twerps are funded by taxpayers... system is so messed up its not funny one bit...
@_date: 2015-05-19 07:58:44
Cant wait till they sell discounted devices and then hackers figure out how to disable/remove the chips :)
@_date: 2015-05-10 06:06:36
So the banks control your finances whether you like it or not.
@_date: 2015-05-12 08:13:30
localbitcoins but use trusted traders only.

@_date: 2015-05-07 12:39:45
wow that really sucks for them...
@_date: 2015-05-10 04:36:17
step 1:
Use 2 factor
Step 2:
Use a trezor.
@_date: 2015-05-03 06:29:14
Assuming this isnt just about plausible deniability - eg. if they torture you enough you would tell them anything... in this case no matter what you say the 2nd trezor needed for multisig simply is not physically there, so even if the first trezor is fully compromised for whatever reason , your coins/savings/assets are fully secure no matter what.

Do internet speeds affect mining? 
@_date: 2015-05-07 12:00:17
I just checked and I already had a similar email regarding 0% fees for the month of april. 
Its too bad, because after the hack, I switched to bitfinex.

** grabs pitchfork **
WE THE CONSUMERS WILL BLACKLIST ALL DEVICES THAT HAVE THESE SHITTY ELECTRICITY SUCKING PARASITIC CHIPS IN THEM!
LET THE MANUFACTURERS BE WARNED AS WELL, LEST THEIR ENTIRE BRAND SUFFERS AS RESULT OF THEIR DECISIONS!
@_date: 2015-05-19 06:38:14
@_date: 2015-05-19 06:22:46
Agreed. I bet there will be a website that will blacklist all such products. Everyone will avoid such devices like the plague.
Not only will 21 lose their chips, but the greedy manufacturers will have their reputations ruined. 
@_date: 2015-05-19 06:29:21
Sounds like a plot an electric company would make.
Charge consumer $100 for extra electricity
21 made only $10 from mining with the extra electricity.
Consumer lost $100,
Electric company made $100,
21 made $10.
Terrible idea. Basically a scam. Steal money from consumers using their electrical bill... Great...

They are both amazing technologies. The cool thing is they are so intertwined, that in order to function properly, both technologies are absolutely necessary.
@_date: 2015-05-31 14:08:39
Been using it for a week now. Works like a charm.
@_date: 2015-05-07 05:00:39
you'd think that people would know by now not to walk around with large sums of cash...
There are plenty of alternatives... Why not just use a bank account and withdraw the funds from the bank branch at your destination???

Buy a trezor to store your bitcoins on if you buy them.
@_date: 2015-05-12 08:45:49
Sounds like a free shorting option. Buy goods and return them if bitcoin crashes for extra bitcoins...
@_date: 2015-05-03 03:59:03
Sorry I'm only interested in trezor devices and that is what I was asking about. 
I dont know if you just had a good experience with them and are posting this (which may be ok?) but if you are just advertising your company in every unrelated btc thread then that is spam.

they like to put accounts "on holiday" and can confiscate your coins for no reason.

One word: Trezor
@_date: 2015-09-08 04:07:30
Bitcoins arent illegal. Exchanging them without a licence might be. This is just using existing laws and exemptions to do an activity without a licence.
@_date: 2015-09-08 01:25:40
Well actually, technically, its just a few business transactions. 
Thats like saying anyone who attempts to not break the law (and technically has done nothing wrong) has in fact broken the law...
@_date: 2015-09-08 02:08:59
No, just currency conversion from USD to bitcoins which shouldnt even be an issue to begin with. 
Why should the US Government have the power to forbid someone from swapping USD to bitcoins? 
It is our money to spend as we see fit... We work hard for our wages.... The fact that we lack such basic freedoms is astonishing...
@_date: 2015-09-09 07:44:23
Doesnt he run a business called coinjar? Steer clear...
@_date: 2015-09-08 01:30:34
Thanks for this helpful comment!
I think it is the "users on purse" do this though. Isnt Purse just the platform/escrow system. 
@_date: 2015-09-08 01:51:35
As another user has pointed out, purse.io does this, well at least the users on purse do this. Basically all they do is buy items from amazon and trade the items for bitcoins. 
Is that "structuring"?  
If that isnt then what I am suggesting is to apply this concept elsewhere. 
If it is "structuring" might there be issues using purse.io?
@_date: 2015-09-08 02:26:41
I meant the fact that we are limited by who can or cant convert our money for us is an arbitrary limitation of the market which in turn affects our freedoms.
Bitcoin trading should open for everyone. Face to face transactions should not be controlled by the government and require ridiculously unobtainable licences.
@_date: 2015-09-08 02:53:22
Why would you do that? You do realise that you should have the trezor backup seed in case there is any issue with a firmware update? ...
@_date: 2015-09-09 10:14:25
links for info on these "private business structures"?
@_date: 2015-09-09 00:05:12
Well I am curious, but I am playing devils advocate since no one else is.
