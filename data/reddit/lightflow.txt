From now on that's exactly how I will explain what bitcoin is.
@_date: 2014-06-25 11:08:38
That is another thing. People were bad at predicting (according mostly to articles like "look how bad people in 1800 could predict 2000, LOLZ", which aren't really a good source of wisdom), but we are getting better and better as we gather more information about the past and more/better tools to predict the future. Things like bitcoin (in a sense of a public decetralized ledger) are pretty easy to predict having big impact on future, just like computers of internet or mobile phones.

$1.4 billion is *nothing* for the largest banks. But thanks for the info, I didn't know that it's not that crucial.

Whats good about it?
@_date: 2014-02-11 21:43:12
Lol what the hell. Is it a well-known picture? What's the context?

I'm talking different kind of totalitarian.
@_date: 2014-07-21 07:41:36
Wow, that is one of the best reply reactions I've seen this year. Well done, Mr. President.
@_date: 2014-02-15 20:25:58
I thought thats what bitcoin was all about. I'm talking about:


How is bitcoin different here? Note that I don't know much about bitcoin. :D
@_date: 2014-12-02 14:03:29
In Russia currency lost 50% of it's value in last 3 months. :D Getting there.
@_date: 2014-02-11 19:39:13
I agree with you, but it's interesting also to look at this in a sense of what you think is most likely to happen from these two scenarios. First one seems way more probable, cause it's not as huge. Unowatimsayin?

The same reason why e-mail didn't become widely used. :c

If you sell now you still can help by amplifying the skyrocketing.

Well I wouldn't say it "gone to 100". It just was there for less than a minute.

Yea, you're right. I wasn't informed enough about that. But my 1st post still is correct, cause Gref may express his opinion all he wants, but in the end it's not gonna affect much.

You really need to rethink how the price is set atm.

@_date: 2014-02-06 18:40:37
Yes, it is banned now. They didn't say how exactly they are going to go about it, but in Russia that's enough to say that from now on they can do whatever they want to whoever they want involved in any way in crypto. Laws are just a joke here, they can throw you in prison just for lulz. For example they sure can say that anyone who uses bitcoin got those coins from someone who is a terrorist. Or send bitcoin to a terrorist. And no evidence needed.

How do you know?
@_date: 2014-06-07 12:23:15


With that given - any strategy means you never lose money cause you can just bet until you win enough back.
@_date: 2014-02-21 08:40:23
Maybe he's talking about BTC amount?
@_date: 2014-02-11 20:55:42
I don't think it's actually connected in any way.

Well I don't think it was straight-forward, I'm saying it was inevitable. The same, I think, goes for bitcoin-like systems. But I think we understood each other.
@_date: 2014-03-07 13:52:52
Nah, I'm one of those who can't read properly.

These shoes were made from computation. You walk on code now. What a sensation. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 10:27:41
Trust me, these "warnings" mean that ban is just around the corner, even if it's not "officially" here yet. Here you don't need laws to put someone in jail or take something away from someone. It's pretty much a totalitarian country, and you shouldn't apply your usual point of view to it.
@_date: 2014-02-10 11:01:31
I saw it live. It didn't just go to 100. It was fast, but gradual drop. Woah, the feels.

Hm, okay. Until then I will refuse those certificates anyway. 
@_date: 2014-02-10 14:00:57
Yea, I'm dumb. :D
@_date: 2014-02-09 09:00:30
They couldn't even draw a straight "F" for the logo and want to cover the entire country? GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.
@_date: 2014-02-07 10:47:23


But there are some methods in mind? I never heard of any, and it seems like if they could be done - it would be possible only for new coins, not bitcoin. Is that so?
@_date: 2014-05-09 11:04:37
Now I wonder what is the biggest Family Feud fail ever.
@_date: 2014-09-04 14:59:14
Not everything, I invested all I'm willing to invest in bitcoin, so when the price goes down this amount dosen't really change.

You can make pretty good predictions based on in which direction things are moving. At the moment its quite simple - "ban everything".

Lol, where is this data taken from? It's just some graphic designer's *opinion*?
@_date: 2014-06-25 10:36:43
You confuse the market price 'laws' with technology advancement. It dosen't matter how many people think self-driving cars, for example, will get mass adoption. It simply will happen at some point.

You just say "Bingo".
@_date: 2014-02-11 21:27:50
Your math is pretty amusing. I think it very well can be "something in between" *for some time*. And this *some time* may be as long as 5-10 years.
And I'm about 90% sure that cryptos are the future. Maybe not bitcoin ofc.
@_date: 2014-01-27 07:05:56


This isn't about cryptos which are *digital* currencies. He is just talking about this recent law that they are trying to pull thru.
And I never understood how businesses accepting bitcoin do mean anything. Of course you would accept any currency that you can immediately convert to USD, cause that just means you get more money. It's not like every business that accepting bitcoin is a huge believer in the idea, they just want more money.
@_date: 2014-05-20 00:41:37
It's never too late mate. :D
@_date: 2014-02-10 11:09:41
Dream on.
@_date: 2014-02-07 10:23:19
Can you explaiin to me one thing I heard somewhere? I'm not good with all that tech part, but I'll try:
"Now companies and governments can just buy ASIC-miner farms that can easily (with enough oney spent) do a 51% attack, since they are so powerful. And this will be the end of bitcoin, and most other coins, that use similar mining algorithm"
How is that a bs?
@_date: 2014-09-04 14:59:41
First world much?
@_date: 2014-08-19 18:03:43
Well, I read it as "more than I can *comfortably* lose". With "should" it's indeed relative.
@_date: 2014-01-28 07:15:43
What are the basis of your statement?
@_date: 2014-12-02 15:41:40
Sure did, I'm glad to have some money in bitcoin now, while it's not even going up.
@_date: 2014-02-11 19:04:58
Remove Bitcoin from all internets!!1!
@_date: 2014-06-25 12:24:49
I'm not talking about what changes they will bring, only that the technology itself will play a big role.
@_date: 2014-03-06 00:18:27
Oh i c.
@_date: 2014-02-11 17:25:04


Remind me what good news made bitcoin go to over 1k?
@_date: 2014-06-25 20:00:20


No it is not.
That is exactly the kind of thinking I was talking about when I mentioned stupid internet-articles about literally nothing, talking about "those stupid predictions people made back then, omg we must be just like them then". It's one thing when someone somewhere says something like self-whipping horses and people are like "lol u funny m8", and another thing when its a huge industry with huge amounts of money put in by biggest companies of the world.
@_date: 2014-01-27 07:08:28
They can't kill the technology, but they sure can make it illegal, which would mean that no businesses can use it openly, which would mean crazy drop in use and price. That's what matters. So it wouldn't become just some "money for criminals".
@_date: 2014-01-26 20:04:56
I live in Russia and this article is 99% bullshit. He didn't "back bitcoin" in any way, he just said that it's an interesting technology. Most likely cryptocurrencies **will** be banned here in 2014. Now the government is just too stupid to understand the implications. At the moment they are banning "traditional" internet-money services and making sure nobody can buy anything from other countries, DHL and FedEx are already not working with Russia. It's about to be a fucking North Korea here - don't expect anything good about bitcoin to come from here.

@_date: 2017-02-11 19:15:33
Makes sense, thanks!
@_date: 2014-06-07 22:09:31

If they add bitcoin - it'll have to have lower cost to use, therefore making it more popular. When it gets to a certain popularity level people will just use it without MC with no fees. Basically adding it will just quicken bitcoin rise and MC death.
@_date: 2015-03-21 18:27:22
Cause BTC works without em.
@_date: 2015-03-22 18:46:31
I think you need to look into what bitcoin is.
@_date: 2015-03-21 20:26:07
You think such volume just goes into bitcoin instantly? It's a grdual process. Bitcoin dosent need MC to work, thats the main thing.
@_date: 2015-03-21 18:26:32

I'm not sure how to explain it to you. It's like saying that telephone provider companies should integrate skype, when everyone can just use it without them.
@_date: 2015-03-23 16:01:52
Because dollar or euro can't be transfered on the internet on their own, they need some middle man to carry them. Bitcoin can move around by itself. "Currencies" can't be a competition to MC, cause MC isn't a currency. It's a service to move them around digitally.
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:51:11
"Is Bitcoin destroyable?" isn't a question then?

"Technology behind bitcoin" is not "Bitcoin". We're talking about destroying Bitcoin. Governments'n'banks can sure force their own cryptos.
