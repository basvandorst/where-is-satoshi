So are databases. But only if you're talking about SQLite. You're not? Ok, so it's a different thing then? Point is, there are many blockchains out there, and efficiency is in the details of its implementation.


What source code? Source code for the blockchain? Or source code of smart contracts on the blockchain?

Does this permission prevents a person who has root access to your system from modifying your database and presenting it as the new truth?

I'll help him out a bit. "Private" or "permissioned" blockchains are simply blockchains where only a small set of people are allowed to mine new blocks. Instead of relying on proof of work, of course. This can be expanded to the how much visible data does a node contain too, which then you'll be talking about a network where not all nodes are equal.
So yeah, "permissioned" is a better term than "private".

Your question weren't clear, hence my request for clarification. I'm not sure what significance the source code, or the program has from your question tbh. The "private" part refers to the data, not the code, nor the program. They can very well be the same program (or versions of the same program), just holding on to different sets of data.


My point is that the term "blockchain" is a very wide term. To call it inefficient as a whole is like pointing at sqlite and say all database are inefficient because sqlite doesn't meet your needs.
On a sidenote, I don't understand the level of vehemency that OP is getting. I thought the AMA will spur some kind of civil discussion but I'm frankly surprised by this level of cynicism by posters in the thread. :/ Oh well.

I'm not OP, but jumping in to help.
Money doesn't actually get sent. Instead, ledgers are updated on both sides. Traditionally inter-bank settlements rely on having third parties, which in most cases are merely a different bank.
Fiat money exist on the blockchain? You mean creating a blockchain to represent fiat money? Why not? It can happen. Or not. Who knows? Point is, a blockchain is a specialised database storing ledgers (at least most of them are), and you can store a ledger of fiat money in it.
Plan to create new currency? No sane bank will do that. At least not one that I know of.
Passing instructions? Bingo, that's one of the fields that banks are looking at currently: how to exchange messages and documents using a blockchain infrastructure.

And how would you prevent people from modifying the edit history?

Interesting. I'm a CTO of a company doing blockchain-agnostic solutions, mainly an abstraction layer on top of it, and I'm going to give a talk to bankers in a moment about blockchains. This AMA is helping me refine my slides and content. Thanks!

Dude. This is like months old news.
