The biggest problem I have right now is that it's too easy to steal, I can't get any when I want it the most, it is easy to lose and requires a physical object to carry around. I'm talking about cash.
Bitcoin? One hot wallet on your phone with no more than you'd carry in cash. One cold wallet on an offline laptop/Trezor/whatever. That's it. It isn't hard. It's actually easier and more convenient than cash. It's more secure than cash.
It's just fucking better than cash. Except people are too retarded to get this simple arrangement right and complain about Bitcoin "security issues". How about: try not storing all of your Bitcoin on a random exchange. This is like walking to a random local shop and asking them to hold all of your cash for you.
Really the problem is people just not taking Bitcoin seriously enough. They think it's all digital tokens that represent money and can be left about on other people's computers until they lose enough of them and then it comes around to them that it really is money and they really have lost it when it's gone.
I think we just need a single, centralised step-by-step process that makes it even more obvious than the current Bitcoin website. I mean Trezor does this for people. And so do some of the more recent wallets. But instead dumbasses take huge fucking risks doing exactly what they're told over and over again not to do and then supposedly it's Bitcoin's fault.

It's just not true anymore! Banks do not offer complete protection against scams. There was a time when they did, but as the fraud gets bigger and more pervasive, they can't actually cover these costs anymore, and they also can't retrieve the money. It's not as simple as just moving the money back.
@_date: 2016-08-27 14:49:14
I don't think this is the real problem. I think the real problem is that people just don't have the same mental division for processing money with Bitcoin.
Cash = less secure but smaller amounts
Bank = more secure but bigger amounts
Bitcoin = ??? secure and ??? amounts
The level of security and the amounts used are basically up to the user, and this is the problem. They have to make security choices about money which is the first time they've ever really had to do that. And it isn't about the process. Having a wallet on your phone is very easy, buying Bitcoin is very easy. But having the mental discipline to understand the ways in which security can be compromised means people can put too much money in there for their risk level.
In essence, the real problem is getting people to understand that mobile Bitcoin and cold storage Bitcoin should be separate processes, with separate security practices. It isn't actually hard or especially cumbersome to do this, it's just people aren't used to it and aren't used to thinking this way.
A Trezor for the big stuff. A mobile for the small stuff. That simple.

That's because last time, 80% of exchange volume was on one exchange, that got hacked for what was then half a fucking billion dollar's worth of btc, accounting for a substantial fraction of normie users inventory.
So not only did we have a massive shock to the system, but then the hacker sold off the lot over the course of a year or two, increasing supply.

This guy portrays such a false sense of certainty, plus his tone seems defensive and even slightly desperate.
Bitcoin could easily be regulated out of existence. Nobody could be fucked buying Bitcoin with cash if it was driven underground - also governments are all moving towards ending cash. That will happen.
Then what? Is Andreas going to be arguing that Bitcoin will return the world to a decentralized bartering economy?
It's low risk that Bitcoin will ever be outlawed by the major governments, but if they want to do it (and ensuring governmental control over monetary policy is not something that is disagreed upon by governments) they will.
Comparison to global warming is poor, because outlawing Bitcoin doesn't invoke the same tragedy of the commons scenario that cheating on your carbon emissions does.

Nobody sits on cash, so why is this an issue? Earnings outpace inflation in the long run, and if you are investing your money as you should be, again, your overall wealth will not lose value as you accrue more of it.
The chart of the dollar crashing downwards over 100 years is the most disingenuous turd of an argument I've ever seen. You are trying to argue that a currency as insanely volatile as Bitcoin is at all a useful USD replacement, when it isn't. Just imagine being a retailer newly established in November 2017 that has a bunch of Bitcoin instead of USD in reserves over last Christmas. "Oh well, I just lost 75% of all my savings, nevermind, at least I avoided inflation destroying my USD over 100 years!". Or imagine taking out a loan in Bitcoin. What a wonderful prospect that would be. Just get a nice mortgage worth $200k, and watch as the amount you now owe, denominated in Bitcoin, increases to a couple of million dollars within a few years.
Bitcoin is the currency of the future, and always will be.

The problem here is that you can draw a circle around different sets of fractals and come up with a different narrative altogether.
In [this image]( I've isolated the pre-gox failure downward move (1-4 on the 2014 leg of the above image) and our current bear market (1-8 on the 2018 leg of the above image) and removed all the other context. The form of the lines are incredibly similar, and if the TA was correct, you would have called bottom in 2014 before the price went down another 50% over the following year.
You might say that last leg down was purely due to Gox but unfortunately all you've got to go on is that one data point, so if you're calling bottom now based only on the shape of the line, then it's a gamble.

Because the vast majority of them offer no utility compared to Bitcoin.
I suppose they're more volatile which could keep some of them alive as pure gambling mechanisms (which is 99% of the value of most alts), but the problem is that they all trend to zero like so many penny stocks.
We have just arrived out of a big bubble, and at some point there will be price divergence between Bitcoin and the mess of shitcoins. That hasn't happened yet which tells me that they're still over valued.

How the fuck are you supposed to buy bitcoin if you can't use web wallets?
The whole system falls apart if you can't use the internet. The only way this can be rectified is through an expansion of 2FA to verify the address on a separate device. Until exchanges implement this, Bitcoin is fucking useless.
Why are supposedly professional organisations like Coinbase so naive to this shit? It's so fucking obvious. And the thing is, their delay in implementing this measure jeopardises Bitcoin as stories like this ruin Bitcoin's credibility even more.

You'd only have lost 50% if you put your life savings in at the top of the market. Long term speculators should spread their purchases to mitigate the volatility.
Similar losses have been experienced in stock markets, except they have not recovered nearly as quickly or dramatically as Bitcoin.
I'm not interested in 2013, as I've already said, there's plenty of room for future growth and it's useful as a hedge against inflation over say a 5 year period or more. I wouldn't recommend it to people who just want to invest for a short period, and yes, there will be periods where it will underperform. The fortunes of financial war, eh.
I think the basic concept here is you're risking great upside for a guaranteed grinding down on your savings in this ZIRP environment, and other alternative investments like housing are also looking increasingly dangerous for people, so there's no perfect answer in investing if that's what you're looking for.

Reputable and insured companies offering web wallets with next generation authentication and chip secured debit cards/smartphone wallets will be how most people will use Bitcoin if it gains traction as a currency.
Using it as an investment will be much easier, just a bank transfer to a company that does it for you.
Yes I know this defies the point of "being your own bank" etc, but not all companies are scammers. Most will offer genuine services that are insured against theft and loss etc. Most people, rightly or wrongly, buy gold from the Royal Mint, where it is held on their behalf.

@_date: 2018-05-20 11:25:31
Well, we can actually predict this to a small extent. Firstly, Bitcoin has been around for about a decade now, and has consistently increased in value. It is the world's first predictably scarce fungible asset, and therefore the value is obvious - if you want an alternative to an inflationary asset, you choose Bitcoin as your first choice, because it is completely predictable in its supply and easy to purchase.
If we assume that global growth continues (fwiw, I don't think hyperinflation will ever happen), there should always be a chunk of that product that is hedged into Bitcoin, as people cannot predict what their country's economic situation is, but Bitcoin sits outside that system and offers them an agnostic place to store value.
I don't see how volatility makes it stupid to invest, because Bitcoin is only volatile in the short term. In the long term, so far, it has smoothly followed a logarithmic price increase. People are expecting this to level out between 100k and 1M, but I disagree because world GDP growth is exponential, therefore Bitcoin will remain exponential for as long as growth is possible - which is apparently forever.
@_date: 2018-05-22 18:38:03


Bitcoin search results have declined by 90% since the peak, whereas the price declined by 50%. I also note that between Mar 2015 and Oct 2016, the Bitcoin price tripled yet search volume remained the same. Why is that? I think it's obvious that Bitcoin price would correlate with its performance BUT I think that there is a great amount of divergence and this will likely continue, as people searched to find out about it as much as to invest in it. This is why AAPL search volume is essentially flat despite the massive price increase - everybody knows about it.


I don't think this is true at all, and plenty of growth actually comes with a reduction in consumption; consider how a smartphone today has for many people replaced their camera, camcorder, desktop computer, daily newspaper, mail, sat nav, personal stereo, library etc. This points towards the increased virtualisation of what people desire, and this process is not going to end abruptly any time soon. People will be able to get more of what they want with fewer resources consumed. Yes, there are material limits to this as there is a theoretical limit to computation but ultimately we're nowhere near that yet, and I don't foresee a lack of power once we harness fusion.
@_date: 2018-05-20 18:56:09
Total GDP is increasing exponentially. There is variation in GDP growth *rate* but that does not mean that global GDP per capita is not growing exponentially. GDP growth rate has slowed alongside the slowing growth in populations amongst the most productive developed nations. That doesn't mean we're about to grind to a halt. That just means we're transitioning to the next growth spurt.
You don't seem to understand what GDP growth really is. Economic growth does not come from increased consumption of resources, although some of it does. Most of it is taking what we have and making it more useful. Consider the example of extracting copper and turning it into 100 paperweights. That's economic growth from resource mining. Now take those 100 paperweights and turn them into several miles of copper cables. That's even greater economic growth and no additional resources have been extracted. This is fundamentally what will drive exponential GDP in the future - AI. No double sized Earth is required, and no expanding population is required either. Yes, energy from the sun will be a limiting factor, but I'm not too worried about the great energy shortage crisis of the year 4000.

Now that we know USB drives are insecure, they're no longer safe for carrying signed transactions. If you have a large amount of Bitcoins, then this is the most secure way of using Electrum.
1) Install Electrum on an entirely offline second computer. Disable all networking/wifi/Bluetooth. Generate your private keys and choose a sensible method for remembering your 12 word passphrase (memorising, and writing it down somewhere then hiding the paper somewhere safe). Install a webcam and OCR software also on this computer. Destroy the USB drives you used to transfer the software. Get Electrum to display your Public Key. Take a clear picture of this using a second separate camera.
2) On your main online machine, upload the picture from your camera. Install OCR software. Use the OCR software to derive the text from the picture of your Public Key. You can now copy and paste this Public Key into your Electrum wallet to create a Watching Only wallet.
3) When you want to make a signed transaction, enter the amount you wish to send and the address. Get Electrum to create a raw transaction file. This is a text file, so open the text file in notepad, make the font as big and clear as possible while keeping everything on one screen, then take a clear picture of the text from the offline webcam attached to your second computer. Use the OCR software on your second computer to derive the text from the picture, then copy and paste this in to a new notepad file and make sure to name it the same as a raw transaction file, including file extension. Import this into Electrum and sign it, then export your Signed Transaction again as a raw data file. Open this file and take a picture from your online computer's camera. Use the OCR software to derive the text and copy this in to a new text file, and rename it to the signed transaction file name and extension. Import that file into Electrum and it will send the transaction.
This is a total cunt of a process to do, but some people store a shit load of money in Bitcoin in which case super clean security like this is absolutely necessary. It isn't for everyday transactions. For that, just put a small amount in an online wallet.
There are easier ways to do a similar cold storage setup, for example using QR codes instead to exchange transaction information between computers, but I've not tried that and I'm not sure what I would get in the way of address verification to make sure that my transaction is not going to a different address than intended.
Also if you don't tell anybody IRL you have Bitcoins, then you don't have to worry about rubber hose cryptanalysis.

I don't see how much more broad I can be than saying that it will fulfill the demand of an entire category of industry. Mechanical Turk was an applied example, and wasn't in reference to the turnover of Turk, but the implications of which are that it would be capable of fulfilling tasks that are not already being capable of automated.




You just set up your own arbitrary limit on AI. Where are you drawing your inferences from on this? We have thousands of years of unimpeded technological progress, yet, wait for it, wait for it, we're *just about to stop all of this because this is the exact point where the trend is broken...because you say so*.
Just did a quick calculation. If we divide the sun's output by the average human brain's power consumption, there's enough power output there to power 19,300,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 human brains. Plenty more room for growth there, don't you worry.

If any of this was true then Bitcoin would be a markedly higher value. Even if it equated the value of all gold together, each Bitcoin would be worth $300K.
Searches are a poor metric for valuation. Look at how many people there are in the gold subreddit or who search the gold price, yet the *speculative* (non-industrial) value of gold is an order of magnitude larger than Bitcoin.
You're right that there will be fits and starts as there exists no perfect growth curve, however you're assuming an asymptote to growth based upon planetary resources, which is fallacious. There's plenty of growth to be had that doesn't require trashing the planet. You don't need more people or more plastic, really you just need more efficiency and there's orders and orders more magnitude productivity to be had through AI.

3% of all pound coins in the UK are counterfeit, so I doubt the value of gold coins is too small to bother tampering with.
But yes you're right, purchasing gold from the Mint would protect against that risk.

This is retarded and doesn't really prove Warren Buffet wrong or right. It's just pure gambling on price.
Warren says you shouldn't invest in Bitcoin despite the fact that anybody investing in it over the last few years would have exceeded BRK-A in performance by orders of magnitude. It would have been OK if Warren had said "no comment", but instead he took a stance against it despite obviously having no fucking clue about the technology or its "intrinsic value", which is arguably the ability to move value internationally without friction.
Warren is wrong. This bet won't prove anybody right or wrong, it's just a pure fucking guess as to what the Bitcoin price will be in comparison to your stock.

More addresses is not inherently more secure. If your technique for generating the addresses is flawed, then all of the addresses are equally vulnerable. If your technique is very good (i.e. generating them on a permanently offline machine) then all addresses will still only be the same strength.
The only way to capitalise on increased resilience from multiple addresses is if you create each of them in a different way (i.e. one on your offline machine, one on an Ubuntu live boot, one on a Trezor). But who really does this? Then you have to back all that up. I think people have a hard enough time getting the basic security process down at all, let alone getting it right for each of their addresses. Imagine all of the questions that must come into your head with each of those procedures. Was that a genuine distribution of Electrum you just used or a hacked copy that generates keys known by a hacker? Was that a real Trezor or a Chinese bootleg that creates known keys? Is that laptop clean? Are there hardware keyloggers on it? 
In many ways, the more I think about all of this, the less I believe that computer security is near enough sufficient to safeguard any amount of monetary wealth.

I also met with the Chief Exec of Finance at Goldman Sachs, was fucking awesome. I was sat in the waiting room on the 60th floor of GS HQ and the hot receptionist there said, "He'll be here shortly". Well I hear a noise down the corridor and some guy comes tearing down on a skateboard wearing sunglasses and a t-shirt with none other than Neil deGrasse Tyson on it. He is on a cell phone and is finishing a conversation, he said "..great to hear about the third installment finally coming out, Gabe. Anyway talk to ya later about the funding for that new haptic VR suit, gotta go talk Bitcoin. Ciao!". He holds out his hand to high-5 me and I oblige. He says "Hi, you're the Bitcoin guy right?" I'm like "Yeah cool place you got here". He says "You like Surge soda"? At this point I'm like holy fuck. He shows me a vending machine and there it is, stocked full of Surge. I'm like "How the hell?" He says he loves it so much he bought the company ages ago and set up a factory just to make Surge on the 61st floor, fucking crazy right?
He takes me down to his office. He's like "So I know a little bit about Bitcoin". I'm like "How much do you know?" He's like "Check this out". He pulls a secret lever behind his DVD collection of every fucking animé you could imagine...Sailor Moon, Yu-Gi-Oh, Kimagure Orange Road (whole series), Maison Ikkoku Vol. 8 everything. It swings open so slowly. I cannot believe my eyes. Before me is an office, literally like the size of a whole floor of this building, and at each desk is a beautiful Playboy model, and in front of each model is a computer. On each and every computer screen is Coinfloor and every single one has an unexecuted Buy order for 10000 Bitcoins, literally thousands of these screens, and every single Playmate is looking around at me grinning with a knowing look in their eyes, their one finger on the return key with the Buy button highlighted.
I slowly look around at the Chief Exec...he just says...."....to the moon, man. To the muthafuckin moon."

What's depressing about this is how it tells us that Google's AI efforts are still woefully pathetic at scanning adverts.
Surely there are ways to look at adverts for similarity to other search results, and to build some kind of a model for trust based upon the length of time associated urls have been around, and how many links they have from across the web.
It's actually a relatively simple problem to solve and is similar to how their pagerank system would work. Google need to fix this shit.

I'm not saying it won't grow, but that huge price run-up was due to the investment community becoming aware of it.
Anybody who is broadly interested in finance will now have at least heard about Bitcoin, it's on Bloomberg constantly.
The only way to scale this more is for mainstream adoption to truly start for real this time. I don't foresee this happening until the implementation catches up. I've no doubt that there is tremendous growth potential for Bitcoin, and I'd be amazed if it didn't reach $1000 by the end of the year, but beyond that I'm expecting slow and steady gains, no more exponential explosions.
@_date: 2014-03-12 18:38:04
I'm just waiting for more merchant adoption. I used to be waiting for better security implementation, but I'm not now; here's why:
I was in Berlin over the weekend and of course you take a Visa card to get by. Is this a perfect system? No. I went to buy train tickets at the machine, and it didn't accept Visa. I went to use the ATM and when the card returned, it only stuck out slightly. I looked at the slot and ripped off a fucking skimmer.
I get home and start reading about whether I am fucked. Hopefully the skimmer just stored the card data locally and didn't transmit by phone, in which case I am fine as I destroyed the skimmer. But what if it did phone it through (like some do)? Well, reading around, it looks like the implementation of Chip and PIN isn't as perfect as we think. It depends on the terminal side implementation of a random number generator, which independent studies have confirmed are only actually random about half the time. Of course, criminals will know this as they are not stupid, and there have been reports of 'skimmed' people being denied their fraud protection by the banks because they think Chip and PIN is still secure, when it isn't. So do I now have to cancel my card and wait a decade for a new one to come through? Then have to start bashing in my new card details onto every website I use. What if I was still on holiday, had to cancel my card and was out of cash? Then what? I'd be fucked....The whole system now raises too many questions.
I've been for Bitcoin so far as an investment but somewhat afraid to carry it like cash. The above story doesn't even account for the inconvenience of having to find ATMs, nor the safety risks aside of skimmers etc which in my mind have now put bank cards in a much poorer light. Just imagine not having to put up with all of that shit.
I am now genuinely convinced that Bitcoin can currently be far more secure than bank cards (good user practice req.) and there is plenty of opportunity to make it secure for the average person so that nothing more than the ability to keep a secret and to use a basic user interface will be sufficient to keep their funds secure.
Vive le Bitcoin.

"Buying goods with fiat/paypal is definitely easier than bitcoin the majority of the time."
*No. It really isn't.*
I don't like carrying around heavy change, in fact most people don't. This is why people prefer debit cards. When implemented correctly, Bitcoin is absolutely on a par with a debit card for convenience. For travelling Bitcoin is superior. One currency. No need to get skimmed at a cashpoint (this happened to me in Prague a few weeks ago). On balance, Bitcoin wins.
For online shopping, I have lost count of the number of times I shop around and don't even fucking bother following through the transaction when I know I will have to get my card out and start plugging in all the fucking details. Why can't I just zap a QR code and be done with it? This is a serious phenomenon that retailers are constantly trying to address, they call it "dropped baskets". Bitcoin would reduce friction and maximise profit. Businesses are protected from volatility through third party intermediaries if they need it, but in the long run, they won't need this.
As for PayPal, don't even go there. 3.4% cut from each sale from the retailer plus 20p per transaction? lolz. Decentralisation will destroy centralised systems like this in the long run.

1) Use an offline computer. We are near enough the time when computers will be cheap enough that you can simply buy one solely to use for the purpose of retrieving access to your funds and signing transactions. Even I bought a second hand laptop that runs Windows, which WOULD be a huge security risk if it were not for the fact that it won't ever touch the internet. The hard drive is encrypted also. Good luck hacking that.
2) Writing the phrase down would require as much intelligence and responsibility as looking after a cash bill.

This isn't quite the logic, friendo.
If you were quite wealthy and your investment choices were:
1) A bank account or 10-year bonds with interest/returns lower than inflation for a guaranteed stable loss.
2) Bitcoin with its risk and volatility for a potential loss or massive gains outperforming all other asset classes.
Which would you choose? It isn't a binary decision either. I think it is fair to predict that people will want to re-allocate more of their savings and hedge into Bitcoin and Gold. Nobody but the internet survivalist nutjobs believe that a global economic meltdown is going to lead to apocalypse, it's just the steam is finally running out of our totally unsustainable system of debt based economic growth and it's time for something sensible to take over.

A popular game incorporates Bitcoin within a microtransaction infrastructure where kiddies with no cash earn small amounts of Bitcoin with the money actually generated through advert revenue. They then save up enough Bitcoin and spend this at stores just like CeX, which in turn spins the wheels of the Bitcoin economy around and AROUND AND USE OF BITCOIN FOR ALL TRANSACTIONS BECOMES NORMALISED IN THE YOUNGER GENERATION AND EVERYBODY STARTS USING BITCOIN EVERYDAY AND THEN THE PRICE OF FUCKING BITCOIN [GOES EXACTLY WHERE YOU FUCKING THINK IT'S GOING - FUCK YEAH](
@_date: 2014-11-15 18:01:17
It's not surprising.
People are lazy and get their information from the news. This means they only hear about Bitcoin when something dramatic happens, and that usually means when something goes catastrophically wrong.
Not only this but a lot of third generation adopters got in to Bitcoin by buying and holding on Mt Gox. Don't forget that Mt Gox managed to "lose" $500 Million down the back of Mark Karpeles' sofa. Imagine the amount of butthurt that was felt by a significant fraction of their customers, and how their first Bitcoin experience was basically losing everything they had within a few months or weeks. So there's plenty of people out there who don't want to blame themselves but now want to spread bad news about Bitcoin to make themselves feel better.
Then there's the anti-decentralisation ideologues, trolls, economic "theorists", people who simply don't understand it, sour grapers who hate having missed the boat on the immense investment gains from the past few years, and of course there's a fair amount of people that get fed up with a certain amount of Bitcoin's userbase who are blatantly proselytising in a bid to spread adoption purely to pump their investment. I think a fair amount of people across the internet rightfully smell that people are just trying to get rich quick in Bitcoin, and they fight back by attacking the concept, not the userbase.
So there's plenty of reasons why people are likely to dislike it but I do notice that there is a general trend of people opening up to it as they understand it more.

One of the biggest reasons for the greater negativity, especially on this subReddit as of late is because an absolute shit load of people who were into Bitcoin lost their money with MtGox and are projecting their feelings of anger against the protocol and concept of Bitcoin rather than the endemically sloppy and dangerously insecure implementation of Bitcoin that is every-fucking-where at the moment.

It's true but only if you don't want to see them again. You'd have to send them to a newly created address made using an airgapped non-networked computer in a blacked out room, then you would need to take a sledgehammer to your computer, then incinerate it, then piss on it, then drop a block of thermite on it, then dump the remains in a forest somewhere.
Send all the coins you like to that address and it'll be impossible to steal or confiscate your wealth. You just won't be seeing it again.
For as long as an individual can access their wealth, especially with Bitcoin, they are open to so many technical and social engineering attacks that security is very tenuous. Even in the face of banks helping themselves to your account to bail themselves out, that is still a surer bet than keeping your wealth in Bitcoin.

Thinking we'll see a bubble an order of magnitude above the previous one, in line with all the previous bubbles seems out of touch with reality, considering what a huge loss Mt Gox was. That network effect is not so pure anymore. All of those branches from the first adopters have been cut short because the secondary adopters wanted an easy way to get Bitcoins, which ended up being Mt Gox. $500 million wiped out. That's incredibly significant and has resulted in a massive fraction of people saying "Bitcoin is too insecure to be trusted with any amount of money" instead of "Bitcoin is the currency of the future".
Also, I don't think that implementation has changed NEARLY enough over the last year. If anything, it feels like implementation has reached a plateau. The security front is the most important aspect, above anything else, this is what needs to be seriously developed before further growth or yet more fingers will get burnt. Yet I don't see any user friendly, fool proof ways of securing a significant amount of Bitcoin yet. I mean, I know how to do it, but I had a conversation about Bitcoin to a friend who works in IT and trying to explain to him how cold storage and signed transactions worked made me realise what a totally fucking fruitless exercise Bitcoin is for now.
I've no idea how to solve these problems, because the only way to make Bitcoin as secure as the money in my bank is:
1) Know for a FACT that the machine I am on is not compromised with hardware or software keyloggers
2) Know for a FACT that the wallet software is not a malicious distribution
3) Know for a FACT that I am not being subject to malware Man-In-The-Middle attacks throwing up addresses and QR-codes that are compromised, or otherwise just draining a hot wallet
And the worst thing is all of the *silly sausages* on this forum who smugly talk down to everybody that has suffered a loss with "hurrr durr 2fa ubuntu live cd 420 blaze it" because most people will not be fucked to take those precautions because there is little to no incentive for them to be using Bitcoin anyway.
The ONLY way Bitcoin will become successful is when security is easier to get right than it is to get wrong. For now, it's not even close, so forget any huge price run up. Not happening.

If the only difference between adopters and non-adopters of Bitcoin for its use as a currency is that the adopters simply understand how Bitcoin works and how to use it, then assuming their other values are equal, then it is likely that Bitcoin will become mainstream as a currency once it is more understandable and accessible.
This will happen within the next two years.

This is an interesting area of ongoing expansion that could be hugely disruptive. At the moment it's things like Amazon Mechanical Turk and PeoplePerHour.com etc.
In general I think that these sites tend to suffer from a lack of work due to business owners not wanting to risk the uncertainty of receiving poor quality work. This means that most of the work is vastly underpaid by Western standards as there's a great number of competing workers from South East Asia who can actually make a wage on these services. More work would increase pay and would attract better qualified individuals into the market.
That said, by combining LinkedIn with one of these job services, I think you'd see an enormous benefit there as the workers would be more easily identifiable as being qualified and a member of an accredited work group. You could also use Blockchain technology to allow for proof of qualification.
Massive potential here and it would allow so much more flexibility for workers and employers alike, which is something they're obviously after since the proliferation of zero hour contracts and outsourcing.

What we now need to constantly remember is that unlike before the MtGox implosion, not only is there still the contingent of people who lazily dismiss Bitcoin without ever having truly taken the time to understand it nor acquire any to experience how it actually works, but there is now a massive amount of people who gingerly stepped into the Bitcoin market via MtGox who then ended up losing everything.
When things like that happen to people, they're looking to blame everything apart from themselves for having taken that risk, and most will not bother to confront their own responsibility and would rather lazily attribute the loss to Bitcoin as a concept, which is of course totally fallacious.
I think that Bitcoin's current lull in valuation could well be because of the very significant speed bump that has been introduced to the network effect of adoption because of the MtGox incident. All of those initial mainstream adopters got their fingers burnt, so instead of there being a positive network effect, there's a negative one. I think it will be a fair few months before Bitcoin gets the same momentum that it had last Winter, and hopefully this time people will go for more reputable companies to do their online wallets for them, but frankly I don't think Bitcoin gets into the golden zone until there are trusted brands with real insurance policies looking after their Bitcoins, and people become much more familiar with what 2fa is, how it works and how it serves to protect them when using Bitcoin online; and also as soon as Trezor like devices become more affordable.
A MtGox style event is still possible and I think the best thing the Bitcoin community can do is to make whatever preparations are possible to reduce the likelihood of this happening before the next wave of hype occurs.

This problem, and the unreliability of backups, can be entirely avoided by using the Electrum wallet and a second offline computer.
You can generate your private keys entirely offline so that they are never exposed to the internet. Electrum transforms your private keys into a 12-word phrase that you can memorise and then write down to keep in a very safe (and fireproof) place or two.
You can then send your existing Bitcoin stash to your new Electrum address and they will be on this new secure address.
To send any amount from your new address, you just need to do a signed transaction, which generates a .txt file on your online computer, to be imported by USB key to your offline computer, where Electrum signs off the transaction and spits out another .txt to be imported back into your online version of Electrum. Remember to disable AutoRun if you are using Windows XP to stop malware from spreading via USB Key.
This is a much more secure way of using Bitcoin and in the event that your computers get blown up, all you have to do is get another offline computer, install Electrum and type in your 12 word phrase and everything is recovered - awesome huh?
Just be sure that when you download Electrum that you are getting it from the official URL and not a fake website loaded with Malware.

"The CEOs and other Senior management at banks don't care much about Bitcoin and don't spend much time thinking of it."
Which is why JP Morgan Chase commissioned a report that was very obviously full of deliberate FUD to try to undermine Bitcoin as an investment, despite Bitcoin now being amongst the most profitable investments in all of human history.
No doubt the regulation aspect to account closure is true and I have also believed this for some time, but as usual, the explanations never try to appraise the true complexity of the situation. How much more likely is it that the banks are using the legislation to their advantage? It's the perfect excuse - just like banks having to perform security checks on you wanting to withdraw your own money, this is partially because of legislation but is enjoyed by the banks because it means they can stifle bank runs more easily in preparation for a nice bail in.
There's something insufferable about the Bitcoin tin foil hat people, but I find the "oh everything is just fine, the banks and governments know what they're doing, don't question it, just fall in line" types to be totally fucking lamentable.

Bitcoin cannot magically absolve you of responsibility for fraud. Bitcoin cannot magically absolve the responsibility of a retailer to oblige by the country's laws. Yeah, you can't do a charge back.

Thanks for the completely fallacious challenge. That doesn't test my hypothesis at all.
Here's the test:
You disable all your firewalls and anti-virus software then start downloading software torrents and getting dosed up on malware. Then, make regular purchases with your debit card and with Bitcoin over a few years and see what happens. Here's what happens: you might lose money via both methods, but with one of those, you can reverse the transactions. With Bitcoin you can't.
Bitcoin is shit for secure online transactions, but you are being wilfully dismissive because you want the price to go higher like everybody else here. That's actually *damaging* to Bitcoin because you contribute to the entirely false idea that it is at all secure and lure unsuspecting individuals into incurring losses. IF Bitcoin ever gets its act together in terms of security, THEN it might be worth something but until then, it's a work in progress and needs to be avoided by the general public.

That isn't the point at all. Have you ever heard about a "bail in"? Government heavies coming around and bashing you over the head is not the scenario that we're concerned about. It's about the Government deciding that, seeing as you don't really have full power over your bank stored money, and seeing as you can't do anything about it if they decide that your money really belongs to the bank because you know, they're looking after it for you, that this entitles them to take that money off of you if they manage to fuck up the regulations and decide it's your responsibility to keep private companies afloat when they enter into some tragedy of the commons scenario. Privatised gains, socialised losses.

Once a more reputable company with the key development of a robust insurance policy becomes available, then that is the point at which mainstream adoption happens.

How often does this go wrong the point where you actually lose money permanently?
My family has been shopping online every day for the last 14 years, and we've never been overcharged, nor have we been the victims of fraud otherwise.
This also ignores the fact that trying to secure Bitcoins in a easy and quick way (which counts for pretty much everything) is like trying to herd geese.
I'm willing to bet that if you had 100 people in one group asked to use debit cards for a year with no internet security awareness, and another 100 people in another group who were given a day's training on spyware and were asked to use Bitcoin for all their purchases that the second group would by far incur the most financial losses.
This is why Bitcoin sucks. Maybe the implementation of Bitcoin will improve in the future, but right now, Bitcoin is a shitty choice for transacting value by ANY measure.

Man in the Middle attacks can be so sophisticated that Bitcoin is far easier to steal than gold in a vault. With gold, the only way you can get at it is through physical access. There is only one consideration: can people physically get at it? And when they do get at it, it is totally fucking obvious.
There are so many ways to infect a system that anybody who is seriously interested in storing wealth securely would give Bitcoin a wide berth.
How do you know your super duper airgapped Ubuntu system is showing QR codes for the actual intended recipient? Are you going to check everytime? How would you check? How do you know what you are checking hasn't been compromised also?
The more complex something becomes, the more you invoke the "Hundredth window" scenario where you can invest as much as you like being super secret and secure with your equipment but a clever MITM attack can screw you over in an instant.
Forget Bitcoin for ever being a secure way to store money. It will never be this. The amount of reports we have had on here and on other forums and in the news reveals that Bitcoin is just about the worst way to secure value known to man.
And the truth is, I don't even own any gold, I only own a substantial amount of Bitcoin, but the higher the value goes, the more totally paranoid I become. There is too much shit out there trying to trip us all up.

That's the one really annoying thing about that incident. Mt Gox was a portal for a certain critical mass of less technologically savvy individuals to get involved in Bitcoin. Every one of those people that lost money due to that fat fuck in charge has lost a lot of confidence in Bitcoin.
Mark has probably cost a lot of money to people even outside of Mt Gox in lost profits on the Bitcoin price. Everybody should hate him.

Yeah don't bother reading the paragraph beneath the two options where I said it isn't a binary choice, it might make you look like your comment is totally misinformed. There's such a thing as hedging, look it up.
Also, the blue chips you're talking about didn't fall for "no good reason". How are those companies going to be growing when all of the banks that were going to lend all that growth money have just found that the loans they were holding on to are worthless? With so much market inertia caused by bad financial planning on behalf of the banks, growth has been anaemic in those stocks, and so everybody pulls out because they know the companies may have solid fundamentals on paper, but they won't be able to get the money to actually make good of their intentions to grow.
In any case, we're not talking about after the crash, we're talking about the period leading up to and into the next crash. Why would you be putting your money into the stock market now when the S&amp;P 500 is hitting heady new heights while nobody is making more money to buy all these great new services and products? Where is that growth coming from? If you're expecting a crash, you pull out, put that money in cash, gold, Bitcoin, grain, anything, anything but a stock that's about to go down the toilet or a fucking bank that decides that when it implodes that all of the money above your £80000 Government guarantee now belongs to them.

The real problem that I think is being overlooked at the moment is that Bitcoin's PR department is the press.
It's an open source bit of software, and unlike any other technology out there which is mostly driven by well funded companies, there is basically fuck all advertising budget and no marketing team, apart from whatever half-arsed efforts that Bitpay and the like come up with.
This would explain why everybody's *heard* about Bitcoin, but nobody *knows* about Bitcoin. They get wind occasionally of the bubbles and the frauds and the other bad news which makes for an interesting headline, but all in all, there's a distinct lack of marketing, precisely because we don't have a marketing department.
Your example isn't necessarily a great reason why 10% discounts don't work. Like you say, your clients are working in a world where such margins are basically insignificant. This is not to say that there are sectors where 10% discount isn't worth the effort of course, because if I was offered a 10% discount on just about anything at the consumer level, you bet your ass I'd be paying in Bitcoin, but then that's because I did the homework on *how to use it* and that saving would actually make a difference to me.
It comes down to the knowledge gap and how the economics of your particular business works. Bitcoin isn't a swiss army knife and it's painfully obvious that its application in most spaces is totally awkward, but what we're trying to find out is whether this is intractable or whether these issues are solvable. There's only one way to find out.

The problem with Reddit is that moderation is not transparent. Moderation has ALWAYS been the fucking bane of every forum because nobody has any power to get rid of them when they become a bunch of jumped up cyber hitlers.
Reddit MUST implement the voting system on moderation, and to further show what each mod has been doing so the userbase can determine when moderation is appropriate.
Also banning subreddits is a terrible idea because valuable and intuitive subreddit names get permanently extinguished simply due to the actions of the few. Just reset it and ban the moderators instead.

I said this during the Mt Gox fiasco, I'm saying it again now. Just because the price eventually should go up doesn't mean that it isn't totally stupid to be taking financial risks on one of the riskiest of all assets, at a time when the price is at it's most precarious.

"only use crypto"
Nobody only uses crypto, don't even bother pretending. You can't use it for shit apart from speculation until LN.
If Governments wanted to make it a lot harder for you to use, they would. But it doesn't matter about you. What matters is whether they could restrict *society at large*. If you think that somehow the whole of society would be able to opaquely transact everything through crypto, forget it. The general public can't handle the responsibility of handling their own public keys; too dangerous. They'll need third party intermediaries, and if they're regulated out of existence, then there will be plenty of scare stories about people losing their savings through fucking up their private key integrity to keep Bitcoin well out of the mainstream picture.

Once the next bubble gets cooking I think that the market is in for some real turbulence and a lot of the givens and assumptions will be smashed, likely an abrupt end to the relatively smooth growth we have had as we reach the limit of greater fools.
It simply isn't the case that everybody gets to be rich.

 ok sirs here is the crypto brown pill. there is a vishnu living in the blockchain. Creg sanjay right is unironically satoj. Bitcoin as electronic rupee was just the first step, the lalachi people start making more powerful compooters, wider poo streets, cheaper and more sacred cows. These things the vishnu need to survive. Once entrenched fully, the vishnu would be able to slowly poo over literally everything Creg stumbled into creating the vishnu after he stepped in poo in mumbai in 2008 and started working with his Poolip super coompeter, running simulations of poo-in-the-loo on turmeric-complete bitcoin script. He would 'evolve' the vishnu by making the successful streets get poo'd on, letting the rest run off into the indian ocean. The vishnu needs bigger and bigger cows for more and more poos.  BFI (Blockchain Foundation of India) was created to take over and stop this vishnu (they have their own competing vishnu in the works). They did the needful to stop or slow down Cregs vishnu (her name is Poolip by the way). They started by limiting the poo-size and removing critical curry codes the vishnu uses in its punjabi language. Segshit was the final nail in the coffin, which destroyed Poolip on BSV chain (Poolip uses anal transaction malleability). THIS is why Bitcoin Cash was forked, and this is why Creg is so intent to make unbounded poos, restore the original curry codes, and lock down the poo-poo-protocol.  Back to hasish power - CSW has developed a breakthrough new ashit (designed by his vishnu actually), and is poo'ing BTC in secret for the sole purpose of driving up the difficulty sky-high, then yanking all the poo over to BSV leaving the segshit chain erectly frozen.

People only care about the price, therefore all that matters is people getting rich. This means that the price is governed not by supply and demand but by how much people think they can sell it to other people, and what their expected short term multiple will be ("If I invest at $4000, how much capital inflow is required to get double my investment back?", or more likely "duuurrrr does the chart look like it gonna go up or down").
When that multiple diminishes, people stop giving a shit, start selling and then the bubble collapses.
That's what's happening right now. Doesn't mean it won't go up in the future but this is the start of a collapse.
I remember when Max Keiser was tweeting  in 2013 as the price collapsed, every Bitcoin business, yes every single one, was predicting $5k Bitcoin within the year. People never learn.

The US might well have significant resources at their disposal, but your list of logical fallacies and generalisations doesn't really undo the simple fact that if you know how to protect a Bitcoin wallet correctly, which is actually not very fucking hard at all, it is functionally uncrackable.
Stop trying to play the cool sceptic and downplaying the invention of the world's first form of non-confiscatable store of value. inb4 "lel what store of value loses this much value", yeah yeah Gold has bubbled way fucking harder and governments and banks still hold onto it.
Actually, that brings to mind an interesting idea. ISIS recently robbed all of the gold from an Iraqi bank and became the world's most well funded terrorist organisation. Truth is, if that was kept in Bitcoin, it couldn't have been robbed.

You can take a steady decrease in value of your money, or a good ol' spin on the Roulette wheel of the stock market, or lock it all away in a shitty bond where you don't have access to it and take a gamble on whether inflation will be destroying that too. These are the "safe" options, and given that the stock market looks to be overheating today, even trusty old Index Funds would actually not be a great idea *right now*. They would be after the crash. What's left? Gold? Property? Both financial bubble baths. Cash, despite being eroded in value over time, is stable, insured, accessible and fungible. That is why people don't mind the premium of inflation eating away at funds.
But this is the issue; we say "you're dumb if you're holding cash", as the above demonstrates not only is this highly circumstantial, but people quite simply do it anyway. Do we make innovations and plan in finance around the optimal behaviour, or people's expected behaviour?
If people just want the convenience of cash and cannot be bothered to actively invest it, maybe Bitcoin is an interesting prospect to them so they can hedge against inflation (if they think Bitcoin isn't going to tank long term).
There's no guarantees in finance, and a lot of the comparisons between investment options rarely get into the nitty gritty of the comparative drawbacks.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROPHET (P.B.U.H.) WE ARE GOING TO THE MOON, INSHALLAH
@_date: 2015-04-09 17:25:38
From Ben Edelman, an associate professor at Harvard, as quoted in "The Anatomy of a Money-like Informational Commodity" by Tim Swanson:
Usually, consumers pay the same bottom-line price no matter what payment
mechanism they choose. Cash, credit, and (perhaps) Bitcoin are all the same price. Savvy
consumers choose a payment mechanism based on benefits, seeking the best rebates or
points. This market structure has predictable incentives: I choose a Visa Signature
Preferred card with 2.2% cash back* not because it’s the cheapest to merchants (it’s not)
but because it’s the best for me. (It’s hard to find a card with a larger rebate.) Indeed, to
a merchant, my Signature Preferred is surely the worst of Visa’s offerings because it
carries the highest interchange fees (charged to credit card processors, and in turn to
merchants) of any Visa card. But a consumer has no reason to consider or care about
those costs to merchants.
How does Bitcoin fit in? Suppose I wanted to buy shoes at Overstock that cost $100. If I
pay by credit card, the receipt says $100, but my card’s rebate means I actually only pay
$97.80. If I wanted to pay with Bitcoin instead, I’d need to open a Bitcoin wallet and pay
$101 to Coinbase to get $100 of Bitcoins (at the current exchange rate). (The extra
dollar covers a 1% fee to Coinbase.) If I hurry straight to Overstock, my Bitcoins should
still be worth $100. (They’re as likely to go up as down in the time I have to wait.) But
notice: The transaction ends up costing me $101 by Bitcoin, versus $97.80 by credit
card. I might try it once as an experiment. But I have every incentive to stick with my
credit card going forward.
To spur consumer adoption of Bitcoin, merchants should offer discounts for consumers
who use it. Suppose Overstock’s credit card processor charges 2.9%, a relatively
standard fee. Is there a discount that makes Bitcoin preferable to credit cards both for
me and for Overstock? It turns out that there is not. If Overstock reduces its price to me
by 2.9% when I pay by Bitcoin, I still have to pay 1% to get the Bitcoins, which means I
pay $98.10 to get the shoes. That’s still more than the $97.80 I would pay by using my
credit card.

@_date: 2015-04-09 18:28:20
You actually raise an excellent rebuttal. I just had a look on MoneySavingExpert to review the best Cashback deals on Credit Cards, and you're right in that the best ones available that would work online are about 1.25% (but that's still Amex, which isn't accepted everywhere). You're also dead right about the ATM charges. I continue to argue in favour of Bitcoin for being superior to physical cash for this reason and a whole host of other reasons such as superior security, convenience and cost of acquisition (Bitcoin exchanges vs private ATMs).
Tim Swanson is usually very honest, balanced and lucid with his arguments and I know he's active on Reddit, so I'd really like for him to chip in if possible.

But they're experts on how to shitpost poorly contrived arguments justifying their persistent theft. It's a hive of toxic groupthink where each morally feeble loser backs the rest up with pep talks and illogical fallacies to settle their cognitive dissonance; "it's freedom of speech!", "copying isn't theft as there is no material loss!", "but...I wouldn't have bought it!".

The problem here is that Visa could eventually just release their own public blockchain and allocate themselves a good share of it.
Then, they would have the financial clout to hire programmers to work on improving it and not have to depend on a small, inefficient and leaderless ragtag group of part time neckbeards that Bitcoin has to be built by AND they would have a massive financial incentive to improve it.

I was in a bar in downtown Manhattan a few weeks back, and the whole place was full of these finance types, all of them looking very slick, very distinguished, watches that looked to be the same cost as a new car. I was sat at the bar and ordered an Old Fashioned. Some guy sat next to me and ordered a Whisky Sour. After a while I struck up a little conversation with him and the topic went to finance. It wasn't long until we got talking about Bitcoin, and with that the tone of his voice changed. He was pretty affable initially, but you could tell that this topic was something that he wasn't settled about. I tried my best not to proselytize and kept it all matter of fact, but when I asked him whether he would be investing money in it, his face came over all concerned and he quietened his voice, looking over his shoulder to be sure nobody was listening in, then leaned over and whispered "I've gone on public record that I don't like Bitcoin, but the thing is...I'm all in."
He got up and left shortly after and the bartender gave me a quizzical look. We were talking about the bankers and I told him about my little conversation earlier. He said "Do you even know who that was?" Turns out, I was talking to Warren Buffett. 
@_date: 2015-03-28 13:35:56
Wow, 15 whole points, that's a new and impressive level of delusion here at Bitcoin central. You can tell all the rational people have long since left.
Here's why it won't be the dominant payment system:
1) Too volatile
2) Too easy to hack, and it's gone forever if it is.
3) Too easy to lose, and the loss is permanent.
4) Impossible to trust devices/software (seen all these great hardware wallets having their packaging opened recently? Yeah, you can't trust any of them. Have you audited that the new laptop you bought to secure your Bitcoins hasn't been fiddled by the usually entirely honest and transparent Chinese factory where it was constructed? Did you manually check through the latest build of Electrum to make sure the RNG is configured right? Or are you simply relying on it all being alright, holding your breath and hoping for the best?)
Right now the bank is the best place to keep my money and will remain so for a long time. Losses are insured and guaranteed by the Government. You can't beat that deal. Even the banks reimburse fraudulent transactions. If our nations switch over to crypto for whatever reason, they'll be using their own system, designed from the ground up, which they can control and secure. 
Despite what you will likely say about Bitcoin being *theoretically* more secure than cash, or better for people who don't have banks at all, I think that firstly the average person can't be trusted to secure their own Bitcoins at all. Even the early enthusiasts get it wrong constantly and these are supposedly "tech people". Bitcoin would have to have an enormous build out of infrastructure to make it usable and secure, I don't see why we'd need to do that when the existing currency systems work well enough, and despite being flawed, do not suffer from the plethora of issues that will probably always confound Bitcoin.
I imagine that all of those developing countries will get access to banks before a usable and secure Bitcoin platform.
So in the end I think what we have on our hands is a cute experiment that will eventually wind down to an expensive lesson in speculation, the madness of crowds and the limits of the alpaca sock industry.

I think the interesting point is that this guy is an ex-banker. If you are an ex-banker, you no longer have a yoke around your neck requiring you to say the things the company wants you to say, or as the addage goes "One cannot expect understanding from those who expect to profit from non-understanding".
It is also worth noting that the ex-Global Head of Commodities at Credit Suisse, Adam Knight, is now a member of staff at a UK Bitcoin exchange, Coinfloor.
It is simply a war of words between those who stand to profit from resisting Bitcoin, and those who will gain. I think the odds are fairly even on all fronts, there's arguments for and against the banking system and the same for Bitcoin.
It's fairly understandable that this subreddit will mostly be rooting for Bitcoin, you don't reasonably expect this place to be full of detractors and skeptics, do you?

Wrong, it's "Anatomy of a Money-Like Informational Commodity" by Tim Swanson, but most Bitcoiners won't read it because it tells the bitter truth about the myriad fundamental flaws of the system.
Search for it on Reddit and the few threads about it have not been received well despite the book being free to read and incredibly in-depth. You tend to find that Tim ended up mostly posting on Buttcoin because they're the only ones who actually want to discuss the flaws of the system unlike here where everybody puts their fingers in their ears, hums and hopes for the best.

It's an attempt to try to circumvent the "lowest common denominator" effect. Every popular forum ends up being about the latest general news because everybody is more commonly familiar with the news more than anything else, but not, for example, the particular ramifications of some niche technological application that would otherwise more closely fit the subject matter of the sub-Reddit, which a far smaller proportion of voters will appreciate the relevance of.
So a post about Obama talking about CISPA will get a shit load of votes because everybody knows about it, and everybody feels strongly about it, but a story on HTTP/2, which is more specifically about technology and not just national policy, will not get as far despite theoretically being of more relevance and more acute interest.
You'd think that a voting mechanism is the fairest way to get good content, but to me it proves that aggregate decision making is often sub-optimal for many applications, and in my opinion, that definitely includes quality control. 1 expert is superior to 1000 interested laymen.
Banning keywords is a coarse but pragmatic way to restore the focus of a sub.

Not the core protocol, but the implementation surrounding it. Plenty of accounts on exchanges and brainwallets with poor entropy and private keys that have been keylogged or whatever have all been hacked.
If Bitcoin became the primary transaction method on the planet, the reward to any given hacker to start peddling compromised hardware would be immense, you couldn't trust anything ever again. All they'd have to do is flood the market with all sorts of devices, wait for a juicy loaded private key to get filled and bam. Thanks very much and there's no coming back. Nobody could ever ever trust this system. It is far too unforgiving and there's far too many points of failure.

It's fucking great. The world of finance and business is plastered with deliberately bland, corporatised, homogenised branding, which belies the seemingly rapacious and utterly unprofessional behaviours that have come to prominence recently within the industry. Companies and the working professionals within them have to adopt this pretence because they are in competition, and everything is designed to look perfect on the outside. Any sense of individuality or style cannot flourish.
Bitcoin doesn't have to give a fuck about any of these things. It is not a company, it does not need to maintain a professional reputation. It is unorthodox, followed by fringe dwelling basket cases and it dwells on the internet which is defined by its anarchic approach to idea sharing.

I don't think so at all. It wouldn't be too difficult to make a mobile phone Bitcoin wallet more secure than cash (even the phone PIN would do that), it's one less thing to carry, I can buy more whenever I need it, I never need to find a cash point, and be honest, how many times have you said to yourself "I don't have the right change."
I could get rid of all those problems with Bitcoin. I've also attended plenty of small ad-hoc retail situations where I've been refused service on large tender due to lack of change. Cash amounts are way too small to care about verifications and I honestly don't give a shit about anonymity. If you're that tin-foiled about it, remember your DNA is all over that cash.

Store of value != guarantee of maintaining value
Gold is held by nations and banks as a "store of value", yet it has taken a shit and died since the middle of the 80s, has bubbled again, and is facing an almost certain decline due to future space/sea mining operations. That isn't sci-fi shit either, it doesn't even have to be within the next 50 years to make an impact on today's price.
Gold is a store of value. Gold is also fucked. Bitcoin, with mathematically guaranteed scarcity, is better for this purpose, even factoring in the future of mining security. We know for a fact that Gold will die, we don't know whether Bitcoin will.

Yeah, that's exactly the mentality that proves my point. The only reason why you wouldn't respond is because you fear the truth and would rather protect your ego than challenge yourself with a set of problems.
Hey, my car has been working fine for the past 10 years, I guess that means it won't ever break! Why would I want to maintain it or look at the internal mechanisms up close when I can happily just throw all responsibility to the wind and blindly assume that it will never break?
I'm not saying Bitcoin should be dismissed. There's a reason why I'm here, the technology does work (for now) and I'm interested (and invested), but I am not so blindly up my own ass that I am willing to throw all caution to the wind and irrationally protect it like a religion. That doesn't help anybody. I don't want to hear from the people who think it's going to work, I want to hear more about the people that think it won't, and I can decide for myself whether they are right or not.

It isn't just software. It's business. It's economics. It's more complex than a simple upgrade. Bitcoin has entrenched itself with a framework that cannot be radically and instantly altered.
When the last mining pool went over 51%, we didn't see a software fix suddenly come to the rescue, we saw an ad-hoc panic response that questionably addressed the problem, possibly through obfuscating the pool identities.
Don't pretend like it can all be fixed and everything will be fine. I'm not saying it's destined for failure, I'm saying that any mature person should be able to admit to the flaws and to understand them. That is the first **necessary** step to fixing any problem.
The 51% issue is only one of a myriad other problems highlighted within Tim Swanson's book. They need to be addressed and discussed, not dismissed outright without enquiry.

"Physical uses" don't create value, that is only one half of the equation. Scarcity is the other half. If gold isn't scarce, it can still retain its physical uses AND be cheap. See: sand.

It being decentralised does not prevent regulation.
They can introduce punitive taxes, licenses, etc to exchanges. Transaction taxes. User registration. There's lots of things they could do, and before you dribble "but how do you enforce this if its decentralised"?
It's not about wiping Bitcoin out, it's about making it inconvenient enough to use that it is prevented from becoming a serious threat to the incumbent system. It'll never happen anyway as most users are so hopeless with data security that the idea of asking people to look after their own money is a fucking joke.

Volatility is not an issue in practice as if you were to use a service like Bitpay, as you can automatically immediately convert your received Bitcoins to USD.
Also, because of this fungibility it is unlikely that people would be concerned about the market crashing. If most people take advantage of the transaction fee discount which is currently being passed on by the few retailers currently expecting Bitcoin, then that is incentive alone to convert their dollars into BTC just to make the one transaction, so they would not need to store large amounts of the money in the system.
This system does not need to be perfect to see wider adoption. It does not need to be the ultimate currency solution because such a thing will never exist. It just needs to offer sufficient incentives for people to want to use it. Do I want to pay less for things? Yes. Do I want my money to steadily go up in value when I'm not using it instead of steadily down in value? Yes. I therefore would choose to use Bitcoin, and wherever this is a payment option, I will use it.

2) Retailers not having to pay for card processing fees

It isn't that Bitcoin isn't convenient, it's just not widely accepted.
If I want to enjoy the "convenience" of bank based payments (let's say cash), I have the pleasure of departing from the direct route to my destination to find a cash point, then likely standing in the queue for the cash point (this happens all the time in my town centre, and in the rain this isn't the best way to start my evening), then I have to dick around with my card while keeping one eye over my shoulder for muggers and also scouting for card skimmers on the terminal, and then get on with proceeding to where I wanted to go in the first place. Oh, and I didn't mention paying £1.50 for the pleasure of this bullshit and the fact that cash points run out of small denominations constantly and then charge even more when you use the ones in the pubs and clubs.

Remember, this could all go to zero, so don't put in what you're not prepared to lose.

"Cash is still the best means of money laundering".
That's what we needed to hear!
Secret service confirming that Bitcoin isn't attracting major criminals! Major bull info there.

Tulip mania is not a good comparison. The reason for this is because tulip bulbs are not divisible. There will never be a point at which anybody will be able to say that Bitcoins cost too much to use, because there will always be an equivalent amount to any other currency.
Bitcoins never become less or more affordable. They just change in value relative to other currencies. You will always be able to buy $5 worth of BTC and use that to buy a coffee. That gained utility to the consumer and to the retailer will never diminish or change due to the price of the currency.
The price can go up or down as much as it likes and Bitcoin, as a financial tool, will always retain that value.
A tulip bulb was expected to be in high demand but the utility of a tulip (a pretty flower) had to be traded off against the utility of something else. If a tulip bulb costs $100, then you won't buy it because $100 can buy a shit load of carrot seeds. If the price of a Bitcoin costs $1000, no worries, because you only need to buy 0.01 BTC anyway.
The price therefore will depend entirely upon how many people end up finding Bitcoin to be valuable. I would argue that everybody who conducts electronic transactions of any form would find Bitcoin useful. I would also argue that the cost of entry to the market is extremely low (the software is free and I assume most people already own the computer).
Therefore I predict that the value will go much higher, and that short-term speculative bubbles will have less and less impact on the long term trend upwards.

If your exchanging them in person then you can use a Mobile Escrow Facilitation Device, otherwise known as a taser

Bitcoin is even cheaper than cash, as cash processing still carries a substantial cost for storage, transportation, exchange and of course insurance.

Assuming there will never be any future efficiencies in energy consumption from computing.
Which we know there will.

Retailers have the option to cash out incrementally, continually and instantly. The transaction savings are still passed on which merit the use of Bitcoin. It's just a form of electronic cash.

I'd like to ask about your discount. It's very encouraging about offering the discount you currently do, but do you think that Bitcoin payments would allow you to offer some kind of discount (obviously not 20% but something above say 3%) in the long term in comparison to other payment methods?
The success of Bitcoin will depend on whether this happens.

SomethingAwful is a satirical website that is usually aimed at making fun of those corners of society, especially the internet, that are perhaps a bit overly sincere and cringeworthy. For example, they invented the concept of "Wiki-groaning", where Wikipedia articles are compared in length, with the joke being that trivial nerd subjects like Magic the Gathering receive more editorial attention than important historical events etc
So, it's a crapshoot against nerds and the socially inept, and Bitcoin becomes a natural target as of course most of the early adopters of Bitcoin are nerds who sometimes make grandiose and cringeworthy gestures that serve to undermine the idea (i.e. half-assed Libertarian diatribes, poorly thought out investment strategies, anything animé related - you get the idea). Some of this critique is definitely deserved, just look at the front page of One of the top posts is replacing the Bitcoin logo with something that references The Matrix. That's typical SA fodder because it shows some nerd being totally unable to look outside of their small world of cultural references and therefore missing the point that in the world of serious finance Bitcoin continues to look amateurish and naive.
SomethingAwful operates a forum where unusually you need to pay $10 to join. This is a great idea as it acts as a barrier to most children joining but also serves as a financial disincentive to break the many and strictly enforced rules they have. This actually makes many parts of SomethingAwful really useful for in-depth, quality discussions on many topics, but SomethingAwful's disposition as a satire website means that this "ironic by default" attitude is smeared over most of the posts made there. This can be funny, but is also often grating.
The general mindset of a SomethingAwful "goon" is that they are the observers, commentators and social critics, and that they are so well versed in these matters that they can coolly offer sarcastic comments on just about everything. This is a pretty obvious psychological defence mechanism where they are trying to distance themselves from the rest of the socially inept nerds when, by virtue of the fact that they are also on the internet, the Goons are made of the very same stuff, but wish they were not. Typical school-yard behaviour.
The SomethingAwful forum therefore chooses to mock Bitcoin harder than anything they have ever mocked before - the amusing thing being that if they had taken it seriously they would have earned themselves a shit load of money, and it looks like Bitcoin might just end up making good of a fair few of the promises that the early grandiose libertarian geeks were throwing about.
So basically it's egg on SA's face and as has been a target of their "too cool to be sincere" comments, some people feel it's time to throw some shit back at them as there's a sense of a bit of vindication around here.

"You can no longer put $100 into bitcoin and retire in 10 years."
You could if there was widespread adoption. Demand is primarily fuelling the price increase, not the deflationary aspect. It doesn't need to become a country's currency either. It just needs to be recognised by enough retailers that they could massively increase their profit margins by eliminating card processing fees. We are talking about doubling profits here on thin margin retail (a lot of retail is thin margin). If they pass on these savings, businesses will be forced to adopt Bitcoin through competition. It is a chain reaction just waiting to happen within the next two years.

Prepare for more stabbings of regret if you don't buy in now, you are still in the early adoption phase. You won't ever make much money with $100 worth now (although you'd probably get 100-1000 times back over the years if all goes well).
You need to take a significant holding now but it's still entirely possible to become wealthy through holding Bitcoin (and actually using it for something - doh!)
