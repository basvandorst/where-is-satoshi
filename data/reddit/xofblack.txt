They can be yes.

I've got a question about one point the author brings up. He says that the ability to split payments might be added later. 
Does that mean it can't be donw right now? How hard would that be to add?

Not everyone has the same opinion. In my family money gifts are common, you can spend that money on whatever you want, not what someone else thought would be a good gift.

Yeah I would love to have an answer to this too. Can anyone explain?

No, no consensus needed. 
The best way to learn about it is to look up sources yourself.

It's a network of channels. If you can trace a path between any 2 people, where every channel along that path has a high enough amount in it, then you can pay that person.

What are you talking about? Alot of people have been saying that a dip is comming. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:57:16
Bob closes the channel to the coffee shop, gets the money from Alice and everyone has exactly what they paid for.

If you look at exchanges there are some pretty big sell walls at 12k. Not as big as they were for 10k, but not insignificant.

If you're buying it from a friend then you should be able to get away with tax evasion. You can claim it was a gift or pay him a small amount in cash and claim that was the price you bought it at. 
The IRS probably won't find out, but still, it's tax evasion and illegal. Don't do it.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:30:13
Who is they exactly?

I suppose yes. Though in this case the middle man would have the power and incentive to offer alot of the same services that todays banks do. For better or worse.

Did you ask your magic 8-ball yet?
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:14:21
Right, but banks right now can freeze your funds however long they want. It's still an improvement. 
The hub that froze your money can't even force higher fees through exclusivity, because you can just send it through your friend (or a hub in Morocco) and because of onion routing they can't see it came from you.

No, the first income tax can be found in ancient Egypt, where the Pharaoh would take 20% of farmers grains.

The grace period is 144 blocks, around 24 hours. So being temporarly offline is fine, though you would have go online every few hours to check everything is in order.

Yes lol, a decentralized payment system sounds good. A decentralized  labour force sounds incredibly stupid. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:06:04
It's not an exchange. It allows you to trade swaps and futures for bitcoin and a couple alts. It's all settled in btc. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:06:09
2,8GB blocks is 403BG a day. You would have to buy a new hard drive every few days to store that amount of information. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:05:25


Oh really? Are they blacklisted by Davr Bank, the 21st largest bank in Uzbekistan? 
What about CIH bank, the 8th largest bank in Morocco. 
You get my point. If even one hub/bank anywhere in the world doesn't follow the blacklist rule (created by who? The US gov? lol) then payment can go through. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:14:44
Yeah I know. But saying there were no cautious posts is simply not true. "Don't invest recklessly" is stickied on the front page. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:49:31
This is what futures are for. Aside from just speculating on the price, futures allow people to protect themselvs against volatility. This was their original purpose. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:08:57
Not true. I made a post asking about the best way to trade my BCH for BTC and it got deleted.

But the governmentt does shoot. It fines first, but if you don't comply with those fines it puts you in jail, and if you try to resist going to jail it shoots. 


No it doesn't mean, it implies. As I said, the thug that steals your wallet and uses it to buy food for you would still, under the law, be a thief. The argument is pedantic at its core. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:15:43
Well the 2 are not totally disconnected, but yeah probably not what the guy was asking about. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:52:37
Right, so bitmex is not an exchange. 
You can only deposit bitcoin and you can only withdraw bitcoin. 
I guess a helpful way of thinking about it is to imagine an online betting site. You put some money in, and then you play with other people to win or lose money. 
Except intead of betting on horse races of whatever you bet on the price of bitcoin(or other altcoins). 
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:33:32
Does anyone know how long the chain is so far?
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:23:03
So what you're concered about is that you can't spend them right away. That is a fair cirtisism of the LN. Hard to get around though. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:17:32


You do. The coffee shop does, and they add that to their price. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:48:45
This poll won't be accurate OP. People who have read the whitepaper will be more likely to click on this post. 
Title should have been something like "Poll for the bitcoin community". That would probably have resulted in fewer but more accurate answers.

How would that play out? Would every single person in an economy be self-employed? Well that means no more cooperation, no more factories. Or would every single person working at a factory have to first buy an equal share in the factory? 
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:20:21
If a payment fails? I assume you mean something like, if you buy something on ebay and Ebays servers go down before you finish the payment? Then the payment doesn't happen. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:53:00
Thanks, but how do I get them on Bittrex? I've had some BTC in a mycelium wallet for a while now, how do I access them from there?
@_date: 2017-12-29 10:57:03
Yes. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:13:01
Creating a channel needs to be done when both parties are online, but after that I see no reason why you couldn't be offline when doing transactions. Of course you would still need to be connected to eachother, maybe via LAN or Bluetooth. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:43:41
It's usually a bad idea to post how much you have invested. Just a heads up you might wanna delete/edit that comment.
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:16:44
It's more about being targeted for their money. It's easier than one might think to link a real person to a reddit account. 
I admit it's not likely to happen, but it's just some safety practices.

As another example, other countries might say: "The Americans, who write the date improperly, crashed a space probe into mars on the 23rd of september 1999 because they failed to convert to metric."
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:42:25
Alice can simply ask Carol and Bob. If they both answer yes then it's solved, if they disagree then wait for the channel to close and find out. 
Alice can never know the truth about what happened instantly, but if Bob doesn't pay Carol then Carol can cry foul instantly.

While it's a stupid thing to say, and a society can't work without taxes, people who say taxation is theft are *technically* correct. The government ~~taxes~~ takes your money and shoots you if you don't comply. That is theft. 
Imagine if a thug robs you on the street, and gets away with your wallet. Then when you come home you find that the thug has used that money to buy food and prepared dinner. 
You might think "that's great and all, but maybe I wanted to use that money for something else". 
In the eyes of the law, that thug would be convicted of theft. Therefore taxes are theft. 
You can expand this scenario, maybe the thug steals the wallets of the entire block you live at, and uses whatever money he finds to make a huge feast where everybody is invited. The people who had more money in their wallet payed more for the feast that everybody shares. 
It's a dumb argument, because it doesn't really counter the fact that taxes are necessary for a society. I explained the argument because understanding the other side is important. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:22:21


It's more like "Don't worry, these BTC have been mathematically proven to be yours"
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:38:31
The big node holds almost no power over you. The worst they can do to you is refuse a transaction, in which case you simply close that channel and open one to another node. 
There is no limitation on spending between countries. 
It's decently anonymous because of onion routing. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:20:06


Also...you know...it makes transactions cheeper and faster. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:06:09
I think it's a good gift, I'd much rather get money to buy the stuff I want than to get something I may or may not want.

The lightnight network allows you to open a channel between two parties. Such a channel is off-chain, meaning any transactions made between the two are (almost) instant and free.
Such a channel causes two transactions to be put on-chain, one for opening the channel and one for closing it. 
You might imagine having a channel open between you and your local grocery store. The channel would be settled once a month and even with current transaction fees it would be cheaper for the store than paying the banks fees for every purchase done with credit cards. 
So far so good, the LN is great for small, frequent transactions like buying food (or coffee). The problem comes in when buying less frequent things. Maybe you're looking for a new bed for your house. It wouldn't make sense to open a LN channel between you and the furniture store, since you're mostly gonna make big, rare purchases from them. So the LN is no good in this situation, and without it Bitcoin (at its current state) can't be used as a currency. 
Now here comes some guy with a great business plan. Become the middle man between customers and stores that most people don't buy from often. Call it Bitcoin Bank. Stores can sign up with BB and instead of having a channel (remember, channels cost fees to open and close) for every customer they can have one channel to BB. They save lots of transaction fees. Customers can do the same, sign up with BB and save on fees, since they can now buy from every store that BB supports with almost no fees. 
In this scenario, instead of Bitcoin we have credit cards 2.0. And that is the main argument against LN.

To be fair it's only counter-intuitive to someone who does not understand how transactions on the blockchain works.

maybe for the network as a whole its pretty pointless, but whoever comes up with the next asicboost is gonna make bank. For an individual, increasing efficiency is very profitable.

This was beautifully written satire. I just think that the /s at the end kinda ruins it. Putting /s feels like telling a good joke and have everybody laughing, and then still explaining the punshline. 
The /s is meant to be a substitute to voice inontation in text, but an article like this, if read aloud, would be read straightfaced and it would be left to the audience to figure out it was satire. 
The audience should figure it out based on content and not inontation, thus the /s doesn't fit. That's just my 2 cents. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 18:51:46
I don't understand. If everyone who currently owns Apple stock decided to sell all at once, the price would crash too. 
@_date: 2017-05-14 10:52:20
TL;DR he is referring to the price drop on Friday and presenting his speculation that it occurred because of the scaling debate as fact. Then he got it completely wrong and says that this somehow allows people to create new coins.
@_date: 2017-05-13 22:39:16
If the crypto gets broken those coins would be worthless anyways.
@_date: 2017-05-13 22:47:34
From what I've understood, miners don't really want bigger blocks. They just want Segwit to force a hard fork so it's much harder to implement. What miners really don't want is to disable asicboost, which Segwit does.
@_date: 2017-05-13 22:23:36
If you decide to close the channel then all transactions done through that channel go on-chain regardless of what the other party wants.
 
Why would the devs design a system where the other party can hold your coins hostage? That's just stupid. You really need to read up on it again.
@_date: 2017-05-13 11:58:01
Or, more likely, the programmers just wanted to make a ton of money.
