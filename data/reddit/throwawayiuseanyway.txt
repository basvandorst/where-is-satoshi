for a complete noob, coinbase is fine. you can then work on getting on gdax (interface is more difficult, you would have to send USD in advance, and they may require more verification) and save yourself a little bit in fees. But if you just want bitcoin NAO then it's not like the fees are gonna matter much with this kind of volatility.
by NAO I mean you can buy bitcoin at whatever price it's at, but if you do a bank transfer it can take 5-7 days for it to show up in your wallet. CC might be instant I think.

I don't know the future but I'm sticking with bitcoin for now.
I do think litecoin is good. It's a lot easier/cheaper to move around currently. 
You might also find it useful to get on gdax and familiarize yourself with how to trade currencies back and forth, in case you ever want to dump one currency for another. Transfers between gdax/coinbase wallets are free.

What are you trying to do? If you have bitcoin on coinbase then it's fine, you don't need anything else unless you are moving it to another site or a personal wallet. Do NOT use the blockchain web wallet. Google "blockchain web wallet hacked" etc for more info.
I just read your Prescott post and then saw you were also into bitcoin. I grew up in prescott but moved away years ago.

Ideally, people run a bitcoin node, which includes a wallet. 
For convenience, people might use a hardware wallet such as trezor or ledger. There's also electrum (a software program). I think those all communicate with central nodes but they protect and put you in control of the private keys.
Also convenient are phone wallets like coinomi or mycellium, and you do control the private keys on those as well but I would advise against storing any large amount on them as I don't trust phones that much. I have used them both with no problems though.
One caveat to consider - you are in total control of your bitcoin with one of those wallets, but currently, in times like where lots of people want to move around lots of bitcoin, you risk paying a high fee to move it from wallet&lt;-&gt;exchange

I think cryptocurrency is definitely the future of money, or part of money's future anyway. 
All these people desperately defending bitcoin and calling you a troll are fucking deluded. If it takes off again great, but yeah, nobody's spending it on real stuff, the exchanges always seems to be stealing stuff, and deepweb drug markets, the one place people *actually* spend bitcoins, are saturated with and controlled by feds, so good luck with those.

I think the transaction fees just go to the miners?
Coinbase does make money off the fiat purchase of bitcoin.

check out gemini.com or coinbase.com, you can link a bank account. A transfer might take a few days. 
Also maybe an ATM would work for you

yes you would have coins on both chains. There is a danger without"replay protection" meaning, as I understand it, spending your 2X coins could endanger your real btc.
@_date: 2017-10-06 23:54:40
I don't really understand it very well myself, sorry.

Aside from knowing exactly what you're doing and running nodes, I think the ledger wallet (nano s is the popular one I think) has said they'll support it.
@_date: 2017-10-06 22:40:23
If you can safely spend only the 2X then you could sell it for whatever people will pay for it. For example, here is the chart for the bcash altcoin 
I would caution again about spending coins on a chain without replay protection.
While I'm pretty sure ledger has publicly stated that they will support the fork. Trezor support is currently up in the air, I think in part because the attributed of 2X aren't settled yet (they may include replay protection after all) See this thread  subscribe to for more details.

Has anyone tried to pay with it? What happens if you press the button? I'm wondering if it's just a placeholder or if it gives a 
 receive address.

That's what I did, and it worked fine.
I also tried to sign up with kraken right before bittrex but they didn't get back to me about authorizing the account until a week later, bittrex was basically instant.
I only recently tried to use gdax but it wanted photos of my id and face etc -- which was fine but it gave me an error and said max attempts exceeded so, I'll have to try again later. 
I was able to log in on gdax, I just couldn't make deposits etc, but the UI looks superior to bittrex.

Yeah but don't do that unless you're really trying to savor a moment.
