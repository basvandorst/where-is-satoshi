How contradictory that statement was. Mind telling me how?
@_date: 2018-01-14 03:34:37
Why do we call it btrash? It has like no fees
@_date: 2018-01-14 18:56:52
Sir I think you're brainwashed. Bch isn't even run by anyone or any group in particular but you couldn't say the same about btc.
@_date: 2017-02-08 08:54:44
Well that's probably why china diodes it. But look ay the exact start of the drop. 
@_date: 2017-02-11 01:30:15
I'm aware jmbullion does and they give untaxed for a certain amount on your first order which is awesome
@_date: 2017-02-21 06:48:22
Insert skeptical condescending reply
@_date: 2017-02-24 17:10:47
I can't have a job without disability benefits being cut off
@_date: 2017-02-11 01:05:47
My god I've found my safe haven.   Thank you! 
@_date: 2017-02-11 00:51:26
I've personally never bought gold online,  do they do a lot of background through bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-03-11 08:52:31
Sir, I'll have you know that's a load of bull excrement
@_date: 2017-03-15 23:22:20
Maaaaan this sucks. Hope this doesn't take two days.
@_date: 2017-03-15 23:19:14
Mine was from mycellium
@_date: 2017-03-15 06:06:28
I understand the logic and how inflation works but they'll also more than likely hike the tax rate anticipating growth hence stabilizing the dollar.  Probably should have added that.
@_date: 2017-03-15 04:49:17
I keep it monthly
@_date: 2017-03-01 22:57:20
I'm in the us, do you know if they do? 
@_date: 2017-03-01 23:01:10
So coinbase transaction time has been screwy, is Gemini any better? Can I request a minor fee for speed?
@_date: 2017-03-01 23:25:15
Have you had slow transactions lately? I was unable to use others so I said whatever and got from coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 04:50:11
My crack sells
@_date: 2017-03-01 23:06:26
Ahh okay. Just one more thing, do they request id?I'm quadriplegic and unable to obtain without jumping through a ton of hoops. 
@_date: 2017-03-11 09:08:44
I've only ever seen the term bulltrap but hey maybe I'm just dumb
Edit: beartrap makes %1000  moee sense given it's already a thing
@_date: 2017-01-13 20:25:10
Yeah but I've gotta give a bank statement and give them the right to look through my account if they choose. I have my bank linked to coinbase.
@_date: 2017-01-04 20:45:21
I mean didn't their downfall begin with technical issues followed by an entire collapse
@_date: 2017-01-13 23:14:52
Yeah I think I will. But how should I go about explaining the purchase that I'm no longer in possession of since it's shown in my bank account?
@_date: 2017-01-27 19:24:15
Wait so when you say generate private keys is that like the printed paper wallet? Or just access it from a separate device? I'll have to do some looking into BIP39
@_date: 2017-01-22 09:37:50
I told you I'm uneducated on this, however I'm aware exists for that reason. I'm not saying they're right, I'm just saying they go unheard.
@_date: 2017-01-04 04:05:59
If my phone breaks while mu bitcoin is in trezor am I sol?
@_date: 2017-01-27 19:25:14
So nobody else has that order of words correct? I think I'm beginning to understand. 
@_date: 2017-01-01 19:01:43
I understand but I'm asking about the US
@_date: 2017-01-05 23:09:54
Hold your hope for a week I need my shit
@_date: 2017-01-17 22:28:54
It seems as though these comments are being shadow banned
@_date: 2017-01-13 23:07:01
Yes but you can only have so much in assets and I may be restricted to certain things I'm not clear on atm.
@_date: 2017-01-06 08:13:02
Quite literally but not at the same time since it was widely known all 33,000 had been deleted. He did not advocate any wrongdoing towards the DNC. 
@_date: 2017-01-13 23:01:28
I've got it in mycelium right now
@_date: 2017-01-04 21:00:27
From what I've seen it was incompetent security measures but thst could've been a factor
@_date: 2017-01-27 19:58:21
Thank you!  This has been very helpful.  I will move everything to a budget phone and hide my private key. Once again thanks! 
@_date: 2017-01-09 00:58:29
This guy just made an account specifically for this. I'm intrigued but my eyes aren't trained for this.. Someone should paraphrase if they read it all lol
@_date: 2017-01-13 23:04:20
Ssdi is insurance while I never had insurance because this happened shortly after I turned 17. That's benefits you get for becoming disabled on the job or while your job provides good benefits and you just happen to get hurt. SSI I believe may be more strict.
@_date: 2017-01-11 00:53:26
Also to revoke due to a "technical/server" issue in thr middle of a bull run lol
@_date: 2017-01-04 21:08:05
Graph isn't working and wont display pending transactions
@_date: 2017-01-13 22:15:24
I only bought. . Could I say it was Christmas gift money? It was almost directly after and in seperate payments. I wouldn't be lying either since a bit of it was. 
@_date: 2017-01-09 01:53:41
S if they were to implement segwit they would need consensus from the community? 
@_date: 2016-12-26 20:31:26
Thank you, I will
@_date: 2016-12-31 00:35:16
I sure hope so. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 23:10:42
Or inevitable 
@_date: 2016-12-29 23:34:22
Yeah I know and questioned it myself since it's clearly in my transactions lol. I just thought maybe since it's not taxed and traceable the IRS would want to account for your assets and take action
@_date: 2016-12-26 04:57:43
Thank you, I'm optimistic since Donald Trump was elected and the economy is doing well. I want to get my money in before his inauguration at least cause I feel like there will be a spike. I'll be studying those trends too!
@_date: 2016-12-31 05:34:16
Venezuelan airlines are accepting btc only so I would assume... I don't know by name but the article is ij n if you wanna go check it outy
@_date: 2016-12-29 21:12:59
I'm a shill? I'm just uneducated on bitcoin. I've been using it for a while but only to purchase. I come from the Donald and voat so I'm fully aware of these skeptics of anyone who doesn't completely align with the rest of the sub. It may not be a big deal but I'm asking for a reason. Crucify me for it if you want lol
@_date: 2017-01-04 20:44:40
Mine are pending
@_date: 2016-12-29 21:14:15
But that won't effect what I've purchased right? I'm gonna move it to another wallet but I don't want to purchase more like I planned in a few days if there's a chatters may be complications
@_date: 2017-01-22 05:19:35
I'm not educated on all this but this sub doesn't even permit debating the alternative. .
@_date: 2016-12-29 18:28:14
You don't have to walk  into a Netflix and it's done pretty well. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 00:45:07
Haha well that's reassuring
@_date: 2016-12-26 20:30:45
For the individual, but if btc is used to a point where we have insufficient funding for government then it is bad.
@_date: 2016-12-22 01:20:27
Thank you!  But can't apps be closed?
@_date: 2016-12-29 21:34:42
Oh okay,  thank you
@_date: 2016-12-26 04:30:45
Yes but it could damage the us economy with taxes not being payed abd assets not accounted for
@_date: 2016-12-30 22:58:24
2,450 USD
@_date: 2016-12-26 22:54:24
I very well understand it, I've been studying for months and buying for months. I just thought maybe I should buy  before it spikes which to me seems inevitable. My first transaction was years ago, I just never truly invested. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 18:04:15
Haha I'd hate to have someone find an unaccounted for 100 BTC.. But I'm more jealous you got all those
@_date: 2016-12-30 19:35:11
Id hold out if you've got stable income. . I see a futhre for btc and if it shoots to 5000 or even more you'll have yourself a goldmine
@_date: 2017-09-08 20:08:17
You can't always have this mindset, it's ignorant.
@_date: 2017-05-22 04:25:03
I was gonna buy something but I only had 80$ in Bitcoin. now I can cover shipping
 Thanks Bitcoin lol
@_date: 2017-05-24 01:41:13
So idk if you're that little girl but you're Mike
