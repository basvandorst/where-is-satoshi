Well I'm not sure legally if you *can* but the idea is that you're supposed to stay there as a permanent resident, so you're going to have to show an honest effort to convince them that you're not going to do that (like buy a house, office space etc)
once you get the mandate I'm not sure how it all works, as I've never gotten it. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:27:47

1st) storage is not the only issue, that is basically a strawman to pretend it is
2nd) assuming that storage will continue to scale as it has historically is not a good idea to base your entire scaling roadmap on
3) you are being willfully ignorant if you think the full node count will not be lessened by increasing the hardware requirements to do so
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:04:48
I realize that's what he meant, but it's still silly to pretend that a currency has to be used by the person that owns it

Sure is effective 
There is nothing about anti drug laws that forces cartels to cut people's heads off. The bigger problem is Mexican political corruption. Marijuana being federally illegal is not helping certainly.
Just go to border towns and ask people what they think about it. There are numerous stories of cartel violence spilling over either accidentally or intentionally.

I don't feel like going into an in depth conversation about this, but there are obvious reasons why a hard fork with bitcoin is hard to do. It requires consensus. Unless you can convince a supermajority to implement a change it will not happen. 
That is besides my answer to your short sighted question. I do not feel like there are adequate nodes in the bitcoin network. I want there to be more nodes, not less. With a blocksize increase you will without a doubt see less nodes. For me to be convinced to take this hard fork you will have to incentive me with more than just a simple block size increase. It would take something like a new node incentive program for subsidizing the cost of full nodes.

@_date: 2018-01-18 18:00:47
It's more complicated than that. you have to be a resident, you need to establish a company or get an individual mandate from the government. Essentially the mandate will state you do not have to pay capital gains taxes (on assets located outside of puerto rico) for the next 20 years. 
To get this mandate you have to show good faith that you intend to live in puerto rico and not move back. I believe they require something like 160+ days lived in puerto rico for you to be considered a lawful resident. So you can live there most of the time and still live in america. But you have to actually live in puerto rico most of the time.
But you bet your fucking ass that I'm moving to puerto rico for this shit eventually. It's the only place an american citizen can go and not pay capital gains taxes in the entire world.
Puerto Rico is not a state or foreign country. It falls into the crack where tax laws are not covered. It's fucking awesome.

@_date: 2018-01-08 20:50:46
I get what your concerns are. You are likely new to bitcoin and haven't made a big enough profit yet. You are concerned with making a profit, hence why you are worried that somehow bitcoin will lose all these new people to shitcoins with cheaper fees. You should never scale out of short term fear unless the situation is very dire. 
and yes, you are absolutely basing the fact that storage in the future will be cheaper to back up this statement


And no, just big lol at this


Yeah man I'm sure that millions are literally on the sidelines waiting for the fees to drop
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:18:25
bad for traditional (non infinitely divisible) currencies sure, especially with a Keynesian view
Personally I'm of the view that it doesn't really matter if bitcoin is deflationary. 
People always say why would you spend something that will grow more for you. Why does this matter? 
Do we say - no one spends USD - they all put it in index funds for the guaranteed long term gains? Of course not. People have to eat. There will always be fixed expenses.
The USD inflation has fucked our mind up. The truth is that we always make a cost-benefit analysis with our purchases. If someone wants to spend their USD, the cost-benefit analysis is usually easy to make since the future value of USD is only going down

Putin could be paying him with crypto rubbles for releasing hacked information that damaged America and I would think the exact same of wikileaks
this is all I think of wikileaks:
They release leaked information. The documents generally are of a very high level of authenticity. 
That is it. I do not bother to wonder about his true motives. They are not an issue to me.
On the topic of party &gt; country, I think it's funny you should mention it. My opinion of wikileaks is favorable because I believe in Americans. Not the government or the institutions. But the people. I believe we should know what our government is doing. 
But I think it's funny you mention party &gt; country, because to me it seems to take willful ignorance to pretend that the issue with the emails was with anyone but the DNC. We saw clear as day they were working to help Hillary against Bernie. We saw a member of the press provide debate questions in advance. 
Is there any surprise the DNC just changed the super delegate rule? 20% of the primary was decided by super delegates. They were exposed as corrupt and now need to make changes.
And I agree that I think he *should* have released the republican hacked emails. Him protecting the Republicans (for whatever reason) is his decision. 
Unless he willfully covered up evidence of Republicans ordering murders or something where children got hurt, my opinion of him doesn't really change

When he releases documents I usually wait for the debunking to come out. To see if it is valid or not. 
In the leaked DNC emails, you could verify them all yourself with a DKIM check. They do not require you to put trust into anyone.
As for his motives, I do not really care. If what he publishes is truthful it is hard for me to think of his ulterior motives as even being relevant.

if releasing some boring ass emails is really "fucking with an election" then that is an extremely weak ass system. We are talking about emails here. Not election machine rigging.
There is NO DIFFERENCE in my mind between a foreign country releasing propaganda (in this election it actually WAS truthful) to influence an election and someone in this country doing it themselves.

@_date: 2017-12-15 22:33:19
So basically it's a known exploit. You can temporary double spend bitcoin.
Imagine I send you .1 bitcoin for a graphics card. You see it show up as pending so you ship the card.
Meanwhile, I had sent you the .1 bitcoin with a super low fee. Because right now the mempool is full, it is guaranteed to not be in the next block. 
If I was able to send another .1 bitcoin transaction from the same UTXO, this time to a different address, all I would have to do is pay with a higher fee than the other transaction and it will be confirmed, not the other one.
Because of this inherent attack vector, bitcoin developers made this instead into a known feature. The idea being, we all know this exists as a possible attack, so let's make it into a feature that everyone knows is used so therefore 0 conf transactions are not 'trusted' as being confirmed
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:02:54

"Pool money to be used for the general populace" YES
"a progressive tax system and a wealth tax system are both be mechanisms for wealth redistribution" They shouldn't be.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:44:23
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:08:13
That is quite the elaborate way to justify the original premise that taxes are meant to be a wealth redistribution tool.
If that was the case, there would be a wealth tax. Like, an actual wealth tax, not this progressive tax system.
You're talking to the wrong person about roads, by the way. I am under the belief that you should pay for what you use. a VAT system makes total sense. I don't think joe schmo who doesn't even own a car should be putting a dime towards public roads. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:14:18
somehow this makes it even less believable 
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:02:03
Lol because if you were actually smart enough to read about quantum attacks you would understand why Shor's algorthim would have to be used in a way that would limit the attack to the time between the transaction being submitted and the transaction being confirmed. I won't get into the details about why it's silly for you to bring it up but you are free to read more about it yourself.
I know what a 51% attack is. It's cute you think that would really be plausible. If that would even happen, the community could easily hard fork around it and preserve the original block chain before the attack. the PoW could also then be changed and the central bank just wasted money on a bunch of obsolete asics. 
I won't even get into the conspiracy theories that SHA256 is already broken. 
You should read more.

@_date: 2017-12-01 18:24:06
There is no fucking consensus that bitcoin is vulnerable to QC attacks LOL 
a QC capable of general computing *doesnt even exist yet* let alone one with the qubits needed to actually do shor's algorithim on it. Don't try and come at me with some generalities saying that QC is an attack vector when you can't even articulate how.
 the question about circular logic is in reference to the 'immutable blockchain' which I never even claimed. Strawman much? If you knew anything about bitcoin you would know that back in the day there was a bug that was discovered that had someone receive a million+ bitcoin reward for mining a block. Satoshi organized everyone to rollback the chain to ignore that block. It's already happened.
Look man I get it, I would be upset too if I was you and I didn't do my due diligence in 2013 like I did. It's not too late to actually educate yourself as opposed to just reading an article and saying "AH! I knew bitcoin was bullshit"

except what he's talking about is totally valid.
Nicehash used to charge you .0005 for a withdraw when the entire transaction they sent would use maybe .0015 in fees. For like 50 other withdraws on top of yours.
They absolutely were over charging people, and encouraging them to keep their balances in their hot wallet.

Lol you're just another noob that reads one wiki on QC and thinks it's a big threat. The wiki even says the steps that can be taken to mitigate it. You think a 1500 qubit QC will be made out of no where?
AGAIN, I already explained, Shor's algorithim would have to be used during the time in between a transaction was sent and the transaction being confirmed. The QC would have to be fast enough to calculate this and then it could spend the contents with the private key.
I know the risks full well. They are LAUGHABLE at best.
If you dispute the QC risk feel free to try, but I will point out your ignorance of the topic.

You explain to me how I can afford to wait table in north dakota when i live in boston 2500 miles away. bu bu bu that's a false equivalency  
The question is dumb so I don't respect the premise for it.
 guess what, shit sucks. If that's the only job you can do you have no choice. Find a way to get there. Biking isn't that bad. 50 miles a day is doable. Find a way to carpool. Find a way to move closer to the job. If you can't find affordable housing near your job, you're gonna have to make sacrifices. Take in more roommates then you would want to. 
You are obviously suffering from American privilege. You have obviously not traveled outside of America to an actual poor country. I can understand the sentiment. I too took for granted how well off people in America are compared to other countries until I went to some in college for my church on mission trips.

VAT is a pretty clear system. Anything that is used to give a good value is taxable. So if the good has to be traveled from me to you for it to have value, the travel tax takes that into consideration.
the VAT would not only affect truck drivers, no. Obviously Amazon would have to pay more to use truck drivers if they are paying a tax on their road usage. 
Obviously VAT doesn't apply to hospitals and police. It is not reasonable to only be contributing to those systems because you also are deriving the passive benefits of them even existing in the area.

I'm going to have to research more about how the coinbase transactions are generated but it appears in your second link itself that the public key added to the parameter doesn't necessarily need to be the public key to the address.
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:13:41


Once you have this public key then, why couldn't it be used to crack the private key, as you say? I was trying to understand how you were arguing against this as being possible earlier.
Yes, this is possible. I never said this wasn't the case. This is why people advise you to never send from the same address more than once. Quantum or not, you shouldn't be doing this.


This would mean that the Satoshi blocks (along with anyone else who had mined and not spent anything) would be exposed.
You're gonna have to show me some evidence of this being the case for miners. I have not heard of this before. Should be easy to be shown if this is the case.

@_date: 2017-11-27 18:41:39
No, it's not bleak. You are literally peddling FUD by pretending that is the case. 
The wiki page doesn't 'prove' anything. I already knew about shor's and grover's. 
Like I said, you are only not protected by a hash at the time you are sending a signed transaction to the network. That is where you will be available to be attacked by shor's algorithm. The QC would need to crack your private key and get a new transaction sent to the network. I recommend you to read more about the subject if you are not seeing that this is the most likely attack vector from a QC.

Unless I'm getting paid all of my income in bitcoin because USD already failed, I probably won't be touching it even then
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:39:23
46.4% of the network between those three pools
@_date: 2017-11-25 02:29:15
the herd is coming
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:49:47
just realize you're buying at an alltime high
I hope you have strong hands
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:43:37
LOL you think the government is going to bail us out????
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:50:08
the issue is the monopoly. obviously 
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:21:33
same here. my electricity cost is as low as 6 cents per kwh for the next 5 months
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:52:53
There will be at minimum 100,000 google searchs for bitcoin. 
There will be atleast 20,000 new sign ups on coinbase when they realize the price went from 5,000 to nearly 10,000 since the episode was made
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:04:35
Seriously some country like dominican republic will just be like "OH we are super happy to have american bitcoiners sell it here!" and people will have vacations to liquidate their bitcoin
This shit will backfire so hard on the government if they even tried it
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:59:28
yeah man it's all in the white paper's title, if you have to pay more than x in fees it no longer is bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:56:32
yes, that and radio broadcasts
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:35:51
You are describing the speed advantage you get using grover's algorithm. I suggest you read more about shor's.
but lol @ apparently I don't know how this works and linking wikipedia
The only time you are not protected by a hash is when you are sending a signed transaction that will have your public key. A quantum computer would need to be able to crack your private key in this small time.
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:08:48
You are not understanding.
Your address is publicly visible. It is a hash of the public key.
Your PUBLIC key is never exposed to the block chain until your transaction is sent to the node network.
Shor's algorithm is used to crack the private key given a public key.   
First of all, we don't even know if a 1500 qubit capable QC will ever exist. Period. No guarantee. 
If it was fast enough to crack a public/private key pair in a really fast time, we will have a problem.
Who has the problem? Anyone that sends a transaction to the network with a low fee. It will sit in the mempool longer and allow the attacker time to crack the private key. Better pay a ridiculous fee just to be sure.
Oh what about satoshi's blocks? Where have I said anything about that? 
If a public key is not sent to the network it will never be exposed. Shor's could absolutely, never, be used to crack a satoshi mined block. 
I just think it's fucking cute you came at me like I didn't know what I'm talking about when it's clear you don't lol.

It's not that dissimilar.
Shorting usually means to use leverage with a broker to 'borrow' some shares of an asset, you sell it high, and then pay it back when it's low.
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:56:28
You might disagree with it, but there is certainly *a* reason to subsidize them. I would like bitcoin to have far more than 10,000 full nodes running. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:28:39
not only his defense mechanism, but all he has. He needs it to keep getting richer, even dis-proportionally richer than others, to keep his self worth
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:42:00
people are going to look under the covers and find so much shit in that bed
we might even get to see a 50% discount on bitcoin for a while
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:38:22
as much as i like looking at the rainbow table, it's not like it will always stay the same
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:02:26
Just wanted a new reddit account and name it LionCoin after the bitstamp hacker created a ICO named lion coin, took that shit already
I generated my savings accounts keys on an offline computer that has since been dban'ed. I have zero fear of my savings being hacked
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:52:07
the internet currency itself is the asset
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:18:32
splitting into three pools just looks good on paper when they can still collude together and spam the network as well as other things
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:15:38
Unless I have the option to buy all kinds of investments directly with bitcoin, I would have to use fedcoin for atleast a minute
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:34:28
exchanging bitcoin for a product/service == selling bitcoin

if it was to the correct receiving address then it will just take a while to show up because it's syncing
whatever you do dont delete your wallet.dat file
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:06:01
How critical is the transaction?
It will likely clear eventually. If it doesn't and it gets dropped from all the mempools, then nothing bad will happen.
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:43:44
like 20 dollars in your situation
you need to earn more to invest
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:33:16
That's cute and all but I value the price of my bitcoin as significantly higher than the market price, so why should I sell it or use it until it matches up ?
Are you saying *I need* to sell my bitcoin for lower than I value it? Because you say I need to? 
No thanks
@_date: 2017-11-24 13:31:59
Lol okay bro. Go look at the percentage of gold that goes to electronics compared to jewelry.
