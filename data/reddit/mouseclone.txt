I see that now :). I guess the last paragraph should speak for itself on the WhatIF edit.

No, it means that the major retail market will fail. If the PEOPLE say we are not using your money any longer and they are bound by law. Then the law fails them, and everyone.
Now where I see a kink is that if ISPs do not accept Bitcoin. How will you connect to the net. I would say the net will also need to be owned by the people; and we are a bit off from that taking place.

Source? I only ask cause I like to read.
No government really wants you to use any currency other than their own. The Federal Reserve doesn't want you using bitcoins; thus the US Government wouldn't want it either.
The IRS still wants USD, and if they see you have wealth, and didn't pay taxes on it, then they will come after you. Bitcoin rich or not, you will need to payoff the mob *cough* IRS. Make sure you pay taxes if you liquidate your Bitcoin.
I'm not a fan of Bitcoin because of the ledger and the fact that some coins are worth more than others because of their usage. I find it odd that people will be picky of a traceable Bitcoin but not over a 50$ bill for street drugs. Any cash that has been in circulation has rubbed against drug money.
There is also the dark market. I'm not taking about drug markets and slave trade. More the 'do it yourself' types that make money on a side hustle. money is exchanged all the time and taxes never paid on it. Why do you think that Paypal will report you after a number of transactions?
I'm personally not caring if any government dislikes my dealing with crypto. Don't need their approval to live my life. Pandora's box has been open. They might get you if you are using bitcoin, but I doubt they will be able stop the crypto sphere.

You assume they will accept others. Only reason credit is acceptable is it is based on USD IOUs.

Why is it that Bitcoin and Blockchain get miss used all the time? They are not the same, and using them interchangeably muddies the water for what things really are.
I don't personally if centralized banks and markets have their hands on a tech. I'm not trying to use centralized technologies. That is just my preference.

No. I'm saying that the "Cost of doing business" will put the coins back in to be minded. 
Each transaction has a cost associated with it. That cost can be transferred to the miners; when a block is mined.

paper wallets.

I do not speak for these sites and I have not used them, but there are a few for paper wallets:
Once you have the paper wallet, send the coins to it.

It is to my understanding, the cost of transactions will prevent all coins from being mined.

What does it matter if the governments will not stand for it? The people can choose what they want at any point in time. If I choose to accept pocket lint as payment, that is my choice on that exchange. 
Now, doing business with the Government, or business that only accept a Government backed currency, then there is a different story. So don't look to pay your taxes with Bitcoin.

sure. I'm lost and I want to use it. I still have a lot of reading to do to get a complete grasp on being able to transfer money and receive it. 
I wouldn't say that I need to know the details of how it works, I mean I don't understand the details of how the dollar works, but I spend it just the same as everyone else.

sounds like the people need to fight back against the government. The US will be there soon enough. Capitalist greed is the same as communism when it comes down to the common folk.

meh. don't much care about the DoJ and their problems. I hope they never find an easy way to track anyone moving money around.
