Nope, doesn't download anything. Everything it needs is on the CD and it will just write to RAM

Cloudflare's job is to mask the host (it's DDoS protection)

Just still make sure you don't get a R.A.T. Virus (Remote Authentication tool) were they have full control (see your screen, control it etc...)

Same exact thing. Trust me (I've used them in the past)
Edit: oops typed it wrong it's Administration, not authentication

Sounds like a JDB (Java Drive-by) I hope you did not run, I would do a malware scan ASAP.

No way, this can't be real. If it is, Thank you soooo much, it really means a LOT! ;)

I'm digging this idea. I love scientific notation and think its a great way to organize large numbers. I'm on board.

Not unless you get a live cd infected with malware (never seen it before, but sure it's possible)

It's just gift cards, Papa Jon's doesn't get paid in BTC

Well with scientific notation that doesn't matter. It's a pattern of how far a number is from a decimal point. There could be a 1 B10 (0.0000000001)
