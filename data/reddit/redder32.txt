Market failures exist. There is a reason there are monopolies for utility companies. The same should be true for the internet infrastructure, but we have just not come to our senses and classified it as a utility, yet. Hopefully the backlash of weird shit that will happen in 2018 will force us to rethink this. If you don't believe in market failures, go study some econ.

That is just false. There are several currencies backed by gold, but only a fraction of the reserve. As for the USD, it has only a fraction of it's reserve backed by gold.

Depends. Right now the block size is artificially capped at 1mb (it's a little more complex, but let's say 1mb for simplicity). Blocks are produced every 10 minutes. A transaction is on average 500 bytes. This means that there is competition to get a transaction included. So basically just supply and demand sets the price. This has been a topic of controversy for the last two years and there is a great debate on how to deal with the increased transaction costs. Hence the existence of Bitcoin cash. Hope this helps to clarify a little.

Depends on your regular taxable income bracket and how long you held the asset. Short-term (less than 1 year) is taxed at you marginal tax bracket on top of whatever work income you have. If you have long-term gains, those are either taxed at 0%, 15% or 25% depending on your marginal tax bracket. i.e. if you are within the bottom 2 brackets (less than 75k taxable income ish) then you pay 0% on long-term up until you hit that ceiling for the 2nd bracket, and then 15% for whatever is over that bracket, and then 25% on whatever gets into the top bracket.

Yes. I know so. Not all vendors have implement it because they are harassed and coerced into not being able to price discriminate based upon the payment method which is described in the article detailing the lawsuit if you bothered to read it. Most gas stations in the U.S. gives you discount for cash purchases. There are a plethora of vendors online that gives discounts based on payment methods. Most online precious metal vendors discriminate on payment methods. It's a choice to keep being ignorant.
@_date: 2018-09-20 21:48:24
That was sarcasm. Any costs imposed on the vendor is passed on to the consumer, that's a fact. Credit card companies impose a cost on the vendor which is then passed on to you. Fact. Vendors are coerced to not price discriminate by the credit card companies, and is exactly what this lawsuit is about if you bothered to read the article. I'm a merchant myself and I do price discriminate depending on payment method because customers who cost me less benefit from that, exactly the same way that I charge customers less who are out of state because I don't have to pay sales tax on the sale. This is not rocket science.
I do understand that part of the proceeds from their interest collection is also passed on to the consumers who pay in full, it's not very hard to understand either.
@_date: 2018-09-18 20:15:29
That’s not the point. I don’t use credit cards for the credit, but rather the ability to transact. If a vendor does not have to pay the 3% fee to visa/MasterCard that savings will be passed on to me and I wouldn’t need the rewards. The rewards are just a scam to get people to use the cards.

@_date: 2018-09-07 00:46:59
Why would that be a problem though? I mean, you might have a little less investment incentive, but that is an illusion either way. If Bitcoin is hoarded, the value goes up. However, this will not be an issue with a currency that is currently divisible to 8 decimal places and potentially more with a rule change or use of the lightening network. The issue with hoarding is when you don't have enough of the currency to efficiently transact. If you can divide it into small pieces, that is no longer an issue as there will always be enough pieces to transact with. This is not the case with most fiat currencies as new coins will have to be produced at great costs to mitigate the issue at a high cost.

@_date: 2018-09-21 03:39:49
I do understand there are transaction costs associated with any method of payment. Bitcoin will be cheaper, and much so with the lightning network. However, that's not the best feature. Vendor have huge losses due to credit card fraud and they take the hit, and hence the cost of that fraud is passed on to the consumer. As a vendor, you will take the hit for a fraudulent card not present transaction. In addition to fraud, there is also the case where consumers who are too lazy to take back or exchange a product just files a claim with the card company and gets reimbursed with the vendor eating the whole cost. These are enormous savings. With Bitcoin the transaction is irreversible, just like cash, but better as it cannot be counterfeited. This has huge value to the vendor and thus consumers.

Demand side deflation is bad as consumers demand less products and the economy shrinks. With Bitcoin, it is supply side deflation and that is not necessarily a bad thing.
Sure, it might seem like oversimplification, but if you have a corrupt government that has monopoly on the currency that is available for you to use and abuse this monopoly to print endless amounts of money, you have a problem. Bitcoin solves this issue elegantly by setting a supply cap and distributing the inflation on a set mathematical schedule that every participant can verify. There cannot be a change to these rules without a super majority. This is tremendously beneficial if you live in Venezuela. This is no rare occurrence either. The average lifespan of a fiat currency is 27 years. They fail all the time.
I wouldn't argue that the divisibility of Bitcoin would have an impact on disparity or inequality. However, if you live in Venezuela and you put your money in Bitcoin your savings will not be completely destroyed by inflation because a corrupt government printing an infinite money supply. Bitcoin also provides permissionless banking to the other half of the world population that is unbanked.

The reason why economists believe we need an inflationary currency is two fold and I would argue Bitcoin addresses one of these issues, while the other is deception, but sometimes deceit can be used for the greater good.
1. Imagine you could buy a small piece of candy for 1 cent. Now, after a decade of 2% annual deflation you wanted to buy another small candy bar, it would cost you less than a cent. Now we have to produce a new fractional cent to take care of the divisibility problem. This is no concer for Bitcoin as it is easily infinitely divisible with virtually no cost associated with it.
2. If your money is worth more tomorrow, why spend it today? This is a problem for fiat, as people will start using it to store wealth and there will be less currency in circulation and it can make it hard to accumulate enough cash to transact. Inflationary currencies also creates motivation to invest in alternative assets through deception, but for the greater good of society. Hording Bitcoin is no issue for Bitcoin as it’s infinitely divisible and as the value rise, you would just use smaller “pieces” to transact. However, the encouragement to investment in other assets would no longer apply from a inflationary currency perspective. Once Bitcoin stabilizes and will no longer produce ridiculous gains other assets with traditional appreciation will still be very appealing.

I'm going to assume that this was directed towards me.
If you lose your debit card, the thief can drain your account and you have no recourse to get the money back.
If you lose your (easy to use) hardware wallet and have a pin set on it and have a backup, you lose nothing and can just get a new wallet.
It's pretty easy. I'm not sure why your are complaining. My tech illiterate mother could even do this with some basic training.

That was my point. He is getting more BTC because he want to use it as a currency and trade it for something he wants in the exact same way you are describing. It's no different for BTC, just the unit of currency used.
BTC doesn't have to be expensive to buy. I can buy BTC at spot for no fees using coinbase pro. Vendors may exchange back to USD using the same method or pay a small fee which in many cases is cheaper than paying Visa or Mastercard.

A good discussion benefits everyone, so I'm glad you don't take anything at face value. But I disagree with a few of the things your are stating.


This is not correct. Mainly gas stations and a few other vendors do offer cash discounts in the US. However, if you are accepting Visa/Mastercard, your agreement with them explicitly prevents you from charging fees for processing their transactions unless inhibited by local laws (not applicable to U.S.).
The 2% discount that you get with DoubleCash (got that card myself) is dependent on the cost that the retailer incurs when marking up the prices to account for this cost, so it "socializes" the expenses of Visa and can only offer discounts for cash purchases, rather than making credit card purchases more expensive to the benefit of Visa/Mastercard. Yes, these transactions are very efficient for us in the western minority.
The average transaction fee for brick and mortar retailer is 2% and a online retailer 2.5%.
Coinbase has a 1.49% conversion fee for merchants and Bitpay has a 1% conversion fee. If you as a merchant could potentially (not that is is anywhere near reality for a long time) save roughly 0.5% to 1.5% BEFORE any fraud or charge backs which can be very high for some vendors.

True, but you are taxed an additional 0.5-2% on your total income if you are lucky to live in a country that can control their currency. You also need to make sure that you have an annual salary increase of at least 2% and that you are not saving fiat, as if you do you will be taxed 2% annually on your savings.

I agree that his sentence was extremely harsh and would like to see maybe a 5-10 year sentence. The comparison you make to guns is not true. It is true that for the most part gun manufacturers are shielded from being sued from wrongful use of their products. This is not the case for drug dealers. Since the product is illegal, the drug dealer does not have any legal protection from his consumers OD. Here he is strictly liable for any deaths caused by his merchandise. The problem would be to prove that any OD was from his product. With all that being said, I’m probably considered radical when it comes to drug reform. Decriminalization of possesion and use would probably be the way to go. Use the funds saved to have cops babysit drug users and prison costs to spend on drug rehab centers. If heavy users need to score, provide a clean/safe and very boring environment to get high, free of charge(important to have this environment unappealing to a recreational user as well as medical criteria). This will undermine profits for drug dealers outside of this system. You will get drug use off of the street and rehabilitate some users. You will remove tons of petty theft and public nuances by removing the drug users need of fund their habit.

You fail to recognize that Bitcoin is going to develop. It will not be static in its current state. I agree that currently it might seem excessive electricity use for way less transactions than VISA is processing. However, this comes with a tremendous benefit as the Bitcoin networks is the strongest and most secure network on this planet. With 2nd layer scaling and efficiencies in the base layer, Bitcoin can rival VISA at fractions of the cost. The way you look at it is like the internet in 1990 and saying it can never be used for transmitting HD video. It will evolve and 2nd layer solutions will solve the scaling issues we currently have. Lightning Network is already developed and is in the starting phase of implementation.
The real interest rate is what matter, as the nominal is just a currency distortion. Deflation is generally viewed with disfavor because it is associated with recessions when prices are falling because of lack of demand and I suppose that is the actual definition of deflation and not a currency that appreciates. That is not the case with a currency that appreciates due to scarcity. We have never before had a currency in existence that has not been constantly devalued. Banks don't usually lend in a deflationary environment because the deflation is caused by a recession and not as previously mentioned and these are very important distinctions.

You fail to understand that bitcoin does not need more electricity to scale. It can handle everyone on the planet using it if they use the lightning network and can even reduce electricity consumption at the same time.
