The public would be like " WTH I'm not paying for your superweapon " what member of the public would want a superweapon ?

Economically it is worse but what if it that 20 trillion was spent researching a superweapon that our enemies are already researching?

In this situation, the superweapon for the country that is honest to their citizens ceases to be developed whereas the country who is dishonest continues to develop their weapon. So the country that is honest with their citizens is left defenseless against their opposite, who now possesses a superweapon. The United States says no nukes should exist in the world. If every other country agreed, it would have no nukes itself. However, that is not true so the United States itselfs has nukes, even though they are outspokenly against it. It's the job of government to protect society. If you need to lie to do tjis, then by all means, lie.
