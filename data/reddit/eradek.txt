Aaaand they got back to me, all funds appear safe and sound, ready for tranfer. Will be sorry to leave Coinbase, but if that's the way it's got to be, so be it.

I just ran into nearly the same problem. Also have about 7 bitcoins on GDAX, and my Coinbase account was shut down for mysterious reasons. I am able to transfer my balance from Coinbase but the bulk of it was on GDAX which I have no access to. I'll get in touch with as many people as I can and hope for some of the same luck as you!

The lack of just about any online or social media presence is concerning. Their Facebook "page" is a joke. One way to test them would be to tell them you're quiting. And ask for a refund. If the refund goes through, that would seem to indicate they're legit.

What was the name of the person you spoke to? My guy was named Steve Bolt. He said he also manages the account of somebody related to the founder of TJ Maxx. Also, there's Charles Greenwood, who was signed at the bottom of my welcome email after I initially signed up. Of course I couldn't really find info on either of them online. Do either of these names match your experience with these folks?

Interesting. Yeah I invested via their initial credit card thing too. Supposedly they traded my $500 into $589. The question is, is that real money? Or is it a ruse to get you to send them greater amounts?

Here's a record of my conversation with them via Skype chat. I don't think I was being unreasonable with my requests. Nevertheless I haven't heard from him since.

Awesome, good luck. It's tempting for it to be real but when I look at all the facts objectively, I gotta admit it doesn't look great. Do let me know how it goes, or if they dropped some facts to convince you they're on the up and up.

Whoa! Did it work? 
I keep getting called from 646-693-7168. Literally twice a day. When I called them back once, they said they were from Coinbanks. I haven't taken their call to see what they want. 
Also I got a few emails from a Wealth Manager at Coin-banks named Kate Martin. I haven't replied.

None yet. I'd considered the "nuclear option" of challenging it via my card, if worse comes to worse. But haven't gone that far yet.

The charge showed up on my card as WWW.SAFEBILLING247.COM. Since that was the last transaction on that card, I just reported it as missing or stolen. 
I definitely intend to go to any sites I can and report these guys.
