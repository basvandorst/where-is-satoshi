This is how governments will fight bitcoin. By making it very difficult or illegal for exchanges to buy and sell bitcoin.

It's gonna be a good time to buy!!

Thank you so much for this. After months of reading this subreddit, being lost in the sauce, and seeing all the arguments and not knowing what the fuck either side is even trying to accomplish, this is an extremely helpful summary.

Unless you buy something like a Target gift card, go to Target and buy one of those Visa preloaded debit cards with the gift card. Never tried it but that might work. Those visa prepaid cards work anywhere

Which is a damn shame because there is less then 1k transactions in the mempool 
It shouldn't be even close to that fee. That is wayyyyyy to high

I have to ask as I am still pretty new to bitcoin, but do companies truly accept bitcoin? Most of the big online retailers accept bitcoin via bitpay or coinbase payment. In this case, bitpay or coinbase gets the coins and gives the company fiat in exchange, right? In that case, aren't the companies just receiving fiat? Doesn't coinbase gain more and more control over bitcoin, as you have to buy btc from coinbase as well, right?
To me, this scenario seems less like a currency and more like a payment method that is centralized by the big exchanges.

Exactly. They don't care if Bitcoin does well or not. They know that with a headline like that, the article gets lots of attention and clicks, and pisses off people like us, [and that is exactly how they want it.](

This. I have watched the price absolutely explode the last year and haven't capitolized on any of it because I have literally no extra money to put in.
Something tells me I'm really gonna regret that 20 years from now.

It's been well over 15 years since he created and sold it

18k unconfirmed isn't much, last year when fees were astronomical, unconfirmed tx were 100k+

All nodes have to do is route their traffic via Tor.
Tor entry nodes are blocked by the Great Firewall, but you can bypass it with Tor bridges, especially unpublished bridges.

Last I heard, WA state is/was considering legislation that makes it quite difficult for exchanges to sell BTC in WA. As a result some/all exchanges are not/can not sell BTC to WA state residents.
Don't quote me on that, I could be wrong so might want to google for more information.

20k unconfirmed is nothing to the bitcoin network. A month ago when tx were high there were 100k+ in the mempool at any given time.
@_date: 2017-05-17 03:28:36
So it would be cheaper to send one tx per address at a time?

You experienced first hand of why cryptocurrency is so threatening to modern banks/currency systems. They can't control it and it directly challenges the positions they hold over us financially.
