Imagine what would happen if Kucoin or any other large exchange KYC is hacked, and  identities of crypto investors worldwide were leaked. I won't feel safe home anymore if I would be on that list. Feeling secure about this is more worth to me than my crypto holdings.

For the popular and regulated exchanges I see it as a crime to provide them a fake identity KYC.
But would you trust some obscure chinese or russian exchange website with your passport? Some (even legitimate) exchanges ask more details about you than you're allowed to give them according to your own government, or deny you to use a watermark copy. Or start requiring KYC suddenly after you already deposited money and your funds are locked unless you do kyc. In these cases I totally understand that people provide fake KYC, since the exchanges are not honest either.
Be careful with doing KYC. How do they treat / store your info, how much people have access to it, is the exchange itself transparent? If not, you have a high chance of becoming a victim of identity theft in upcoming years when the scammy exchanges vanish and they sell your data on the dark web.

A lot of washtrading on exchanges is going on. So it's hard to compare volume.. Or are these figures from BTC transfers in the blockchain?

Really shady business. The site does not work, and they announced there are just 30 days left to withdraw your funds.
I hope for everyone there will be a chance to do so bedore it’s too late.
Another example hodling on an exchange is not a good idea. Not your keys, not your coins!
