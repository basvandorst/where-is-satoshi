sorry for the dumb question, but what do you mean back up my keys? i thought once it was in a wallet, like an online storage wallet like coinbase, that the keys were insignificant since theyve already hit the web? am i confusing this for what people talk about when using a paper wallet and populating the key and wallet offline?

what effects could this have on price?  1.1million btc's potentially out of circulation if his stuff gets tied up in court battles or surrendered by litigation?

thats the issue, circle doesnt have an option (or i cant find it) that allows a user to type in an address to send to.
and hitting "scan" will only bring up a qr scanner.


gotcha. thank you.


also, thank you

and to add to confusion, why is the gap between requested amount and sent amount so large, almost 5 dollars. i understand the transfer fee, but cant wrap my mind around why the sent amount would be significantly lower than the requested amount if a link was followed to initiate to transfer. is this the same gap a merchant would have to deal with when accepting payment for goods or services using circle?

I'm unsure of where the .00000001 is coming from or why it is coming to me. Any advice? Should I be concerned?
