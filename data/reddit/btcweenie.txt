Currently in a spot where i'm paying off some debt with my BTC profits. 
For me, I need to see an appreciable impact on my quality of life for me to let go of my bags, and getting rid of a couple open balances and bringing those monthly payments to 0 is going to do that. 
I wouldn't recommend doing this, it's possible that you'll put in more than the debt amount if BTC goes under your buy price, but I've completely decimated my student and private debt this year by throwing a set amount into BTC each paycheck. The only thing I need to do now is mash that sell button and I'll be home free. 
I'm a poor boi, always have been. So the fact that I've been able to pay down these balances much faster than I could have hoped is nothing short of a miracle to me. 
I will continue to invest in BTC over time, and I will likely pay more for it than I did this year, but i'm going to take my QOL increase and run with it.

Yeah i'm terrible at trying to read the market if i'm honest. The only real motivation for me to sell is because it just makes sense for me personally, even though I expect bitcoin to continue to rise until maybe 2ish months before the halving (if the LTC halving is any indication at least).
As far as mining goes, I also do some light mining (nothing crazy, maybe 20000 sats per day) but I would recommend just purchasing the coin directly unless you expect a price fall, in which case the mining hardware may have been the better choice. With that said, ROI and price of power are the dominating factors with mining. If you have cheap or, even better, free power then larger scale mining makes sense.

If you want anonymity, buy some altcoin from CB, then trade that for monero on a kyc free coin exchange (Coinzark, MorphToken), then trade it back to bitcoin sent to a newly generated address. 
Voila, anonymous BTC.

Well my personal reason to sell right now is because one of the accounts that i'm paying off is ending the 0% interest period, and the other is just a large monthly payment that I can now lump sum and not worry about it anymore. 
 I would rather pay them off now and risk losing gains in the future than pay them off later hoping BTC rises faster than the cost of the interest. 
I'm selling off about 75% of my bags to pay down the debt, and while it definitely hurts and I want my coins back ASAP, I also realize I'll have more take home income after paying the debt and will have more leeway in making larger BTC purchases.
I usually put $200 each check through coinbase, and have been since February of 2018. It's just gotten to the point that the money could make a real positive impact on my life and thus it just makes sense to me to take my profit and go. If i'm not in it for that, what am I in it for?

I want it to stay sub 10k for a while so I can fill my bags a little more. Oh well.

Don't remind me, I spent ~30 BTC back in the day for an 8-Ball.
