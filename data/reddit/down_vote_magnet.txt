hi its me ur store employee

Yeah, OP lost me straight away there. Bitcoin is incredibly difficult to use and understand, by anyone's standards, right now.
95% of the people I know have no idea what it even is, how it works, how to buy it or how to spend it.

Did you steal someone’s laptop?

I just thought it was nice to see you all "FUCK THIS SUB, YOU GUYS ARE RETARDS," and then 2 comments later "I'm starting to warm to this community..."
@_date: 2014-04-30 23:37:45
I can't even tell if you guys are serious anymore.
@_date: 2014-06-25 16:56:05
I like how you reverted to programming variables to communicate your point.

Seriously. I have about 0.85 BTC bought at an average cost of something like £700/BTC. I have just written it off as a loss. I believe bitcoin tried, got close, but ultimately failed and won't ever take off as a mainstream currency. I think it will slowly die.
Cryptocurrency or something similar may well be the future of currency but I don't think it's bitcoin. Too much bad publicity and accessibility issues killed any chance it had of winning over the wider population.

TIL I should go and check on my Bitcoin that I bought 3 years ago.
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:03:20
I just gaffer tape all the USB ports on my computer so that the 4chan guy can't download all my bitcoins.

Nice try, guy struggling to get Coinbase to respond to his issue.

Bonus. I might accidentally "leave my wallet lying around".

New guy here trying to experiment buying first bitcoins. I've read a lot of beginner guides and they seem to say a lot about what bitcoin is and how it works, but I still don't feel like I have a clue how to **actually, literally** buy or sell anything. I have so many questions.
So I am at localbitcoins.com, and I enter that I want to buy some. It gives me a bunch of people who are selling at different prices per BTC.
* So all currency I buy or sell is just a transfer to a specific person?
* Everyone commands their own price for you to buy their bitcoin, like any online marketplace?
* When I receive my bitcoins, where do they go? Do I have to sign up to one particular exchange for an online wallet with them? What if I want to take my bitcoins and sell them on a different exchange? What if I don't want that online service to be holding my bitcoins?
* I feel like I should have one "bank account", which is where all my bitcoins are, and I buy or sell from there, but with bitcoin it's like I will have a bank account for every transaction. This confuses me.
* If I want to sell, does that mean I have to find a person who wants to buy from me? Does that mean I could be in a position where I can't actually sell my bitcoins because I am a newbie? Do I need some sort of established eBay-style reputation?

How much have you made from bitcoin so far?
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:25:14
Literally tears from trying not to laugh too loud in bed. 
The way the raccoon hits the side and spins off like a tie fighter hitting the side of the tunnel in the Death Star.
@_date: 2013-12-03 13:55:45
But won't the fees/exchange rate suck?
I mean, it's a start, but maybe not as great as it sounds.
@_date: 2013-12-09 14:13:48
Wait, people actually thought Satoshi would be person of the year 2013?
@_date: 2013-12-03 14:03:01
Are you UK based? I'm trying to find a better place than bitbargain and localbitcoins to buy BTC. Still waiting for Bitstamp to verify me (how long did it take for you?)
How much in fees do you end up paying when buying from Bitstamp, including SEPA charges?
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:49:14
Doesn't that go against the advice I've seen frequently in this subreddit? "Don't disclose your balance - it makes you a target."
@_date: 2013-12-09 14:15:51


Not disputing your post, as I know nothing about law, but how does proving there was a transaction prove that the guy's account wasn't hijacked, as he is claiming?
@_date: 2013-11-22 15:50:24
At the moment it is literally gambling. It's super high risk. If you don't have spare money, don't invest. Might as well go play roulette.
@_date: 2013-10-30 16:19:09
Okay, thanks.
@_date: 2013-10-30 15:44:24
The wallet thing is still really confusing.
If the website holds my bitcoins in an online wallet, how do I take those bitcoins away from them and erase their knowledge of the addresses or private keys? With the bitcoin industry being so young and volatile, why would I trust some website set up as an exchange? It's not like they're a bank, regulated by the government.
Can I just view all the addresses, then write them down myself? Where do I find my private key?


So what should I use to buy bitcoins online?
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:06:11
Fuck sake. BTC is so shit here in the UK. It's such a struggle.
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:05:39
You don't have to buy 1 bitcoin for $1000. You could buy $1 of bitcoin if you want, which would give you 0.001 coins.
But it's probably not worth bothering if you're going to invest such a low amount. I mean if the price of BTC increased to $10,000 in years to come you would have made $9 profit if you then sold.
Edit: It's okay people, I know how to math. I started off with a $10 example, forgot to move the decimal place after the edit.

I'm not a novelty account.
It's easy to be sucked in by the "wow free money" appeal of bitcoin investment right now but it's so volatile, there is nothing safe about it. So if you are really short on money, I wouldn't put it on bitcoin. Even at best you won't have that money available to spend on more important things like food, rent, etc., and at worst you will lose most of it.

So if I were to take £1 GBP of my money to do some testing of the buying/selling process (I think that would answer most of my questions once I can see what happens for myself), what would you advise me to do in 3-5 simple bullet points?
1. Go to  and make an account.
2. Go to  and download X software.
3. Use  to buy or sell.
As someone else said, localbitcoins is like the Cragislist of bitcoin, so I would prefer to know what I'm doing a little more before I were to use that. Which exchange should I use? Everyone offers multiple exchange suggestions but obviously I have no idea what the difference is, so could you recommend one that would be my best/most reliable bet for GBP transactions.
