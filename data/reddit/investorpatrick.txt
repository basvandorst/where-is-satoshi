This is one of the most powerful men in Europe saying it is "NOT the ECB's responsibility to ban or regulate Bitcoin". He gave good advice to the universiy student, telling him to think before investing. Very positive comments IMO.

I could certainly imagine that, one that feels like a moment of enlightenment for the person who is high. But my point was more related to how the seemingly obvious has to be re-examined sometimes, hence the reference to the commentator of said main stream news article. To inclu
Why I bothered writing it and why I'm bothering replying to your post is another question entirely and one that you did not ask.
I did hesitate to submit the post, but look, here we are.
