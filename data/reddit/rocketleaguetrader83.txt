There's nothing that is specific, but there is certainly substance here. "Mapping the territory, having a solid game plan, and picking your battles" all apply to trading, just as much as they apply to life in general. Most people, despite reading good advice like this, will not map the territory (understand the industry and the technology completely), will not have an actual plan (won't know where to take profits, where to close shorts, etc), and won't choose their battles carefully (will trade every move in price). So, despite your illogical attempt at trying to discredit this sentence, it actually holds quite a bit of good advice.

I disagree. Bitcoin regularly exhibits moves of &gt;5% in minutes. Using $13 million to pick up 1.5% in this type of volatility is like running in front of a rolling steam engine to pick up a dime. Most people who have $13 million are not this stupid, because they understand risk/reward and know that a 1.5% return on an insanely volatile asset is a terrible proposition.
@_date: 2019-07-10 05:27:33
Someone with that much money is generally thinking in terms of percentages, though. 200k on $13 million is just over 1.5%...that's just noise when it comes to Bitcoin volatility.

Speed and convenience. Fees are incredibly cheap on most crypto exchanges, especially when compared to traditional exchanges and markets where there are 100 middle men who have brokered every deal. I'm guessing plenty of "small" fund/money/portfolio/investment managers would rather acquire hundreds or thousands of bitcoin with just a few clicks of the mouse over having to go through the trouble of OTC.
@_date: 2019-07-04 04:35:00
The answer (since most of you are probably non-voters and have no idea how policy and legislation are passed) is that in order for things that aren't currently illegal to become illegal, legislation has to be passed. Legislation is only passed upon winning a vote. Those votes are registered by politicians who "care" about the interests of their constituents. If their constituents (us) don't want Bitcoin to be illegal, then these politicians won't vote to pass that legislation, because that politician wants to retain the votes of his/her constituents.
Edit: obviously I am referring to a democratic government, like the USA.

Sure, but that still doesn't explain how you know that gold won't lose 90% of it's value within a year. It's certainly possible, albeit unlikely. However, I would caution anyone to be confident that gold won't potentially lose 50% of it's value in a year. You never know with something that is unprecedented, like Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:31:53
Does gold have a point? No, it's a store of value and is uncorrelated to other financial assets. Bitcoin is a superior store of value to gold. That is "use" in and of itself. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:35:50
No it doesn't. Gold is useless. People use it as jewelry because it has value and is a sign of wealth, that's all. Gold didn't become valuable because people were wearing it around. C'mon now.
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:05:19
If something replaced gold as the dominant store of value, that demand for gold as jewelry/industry would almost instantly go to zero. There is another alloy that is better than gold when it comes to gold's utility purposes. Your arguments are illogical, and you are stating that you "know for a fact" that gold won't lose most of it's value within a year. That's impossible to know because you have no idea what Bitcoin or any other store of value might do to gold's demand in a day, a week, a month, or a year.

Correction, nobody who is stubborn and unwilling to have an open mind about new assets/innovations/companies is taking BTC seriously. These are usually people who don't have money and are poor investors anyway. Anyone who is serious about their money (I can almost guarantee you) at the least has Bitcoin on their radar. Also, most people over 50 aren't making investment decisions themselves. Most of these people are taking advice from their financial advisers. I was a wealth manager for 12 years.
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:20:34
You're absolutely sure this won't happen to gold? You might be discounting the scenario in which Bitcoin (or some other coin) takes all or most of gold's market cap. That may not happen over night, but it is certainly possible. You are making an assertion that you can't possibly prove. At least I started my post with "in my opinion".

Wrong. Rome collapsed due to economic reasons. Specifically, due to dilution of sound money - the aureus coin created by Julius Caesar - which initially contained approximately 8 grams of gold and was widely accepted across Europe and the Mediterranean. Roman economy flourished under this system for over 75 years. When Nero took over, he started "coin clipping" and minted these coins with less gold and silver. Eventually the gold content of coins fell from 8 grams to 7.2g to 6.5g to 5.5g and eventually to a new coin called the solidus with only 4.5g of gold. This inflation created a snowball affect, much like what we see with the USD and other fiat currency, which plays out like this: coin clipping reduced the aureus' value, increasing money supply, allowing the emperor to continue imprudent spending, eventually resulting in inflation and economic crises. This is all well laid out in Saifedean Ammous' new book, which will be released in February of 2018. I suggest you do better research before you infer that Rome's collapse was only due to war. War was just part of the equation (Nero also understood Keynesian economics).

Unless you're a moron, you understand that spending an asset that has the potential to appreciate greatly in the future is absolutely going to cost you, assuming the asset actually appreciates.

Is that so? Well, let's see. Bitcoin is literally indestructible. Gold is almost indestructible. Bitcoin will be more scarce than gold, and will inflate at a lower rate than gold by 2024 (~1.25% annually). Bitcoin does not need to be stored physically like gold does, which costs money. It's more costly to mine for gold than for Bitcoin. It's easier to transport and transfer Bitcoin than gold. Bitcoin is more secure than physical gold. So, what are your arguments?
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:49:40
Dude, are you really that dense? Can you not follow an argument? I was referring to gold's PRACTICAL uses. You are saying that even if gold were worthless, it would still have value as jewelry. I am saying it WOULD NOT. Why would anyone want to own gold if it did not have any value? I KNOW gold is a great store of value CURRENTLY, I know ALL ABOUT gold's properties and what makes it a great store of value. Check my comments history and you will see that. My argument is that Bitcoin's properties make it a BETTER store of value than gold. The ONLY thing that gold has that Bitcoin does not is wider acceptance. That's it.

This survey was pushed to "mobile banking" users, which would also presumably skew the numbers a bit in favor of cryptocurrency ownership. This is because we should assume that mobile banking users are both younger and more technically savvy, both of which are important factors in determining cryptocurrency ownership.

No, you're wrong. Fractional reserves will create an inflated BTC value, but if your unit of account is BTC, then it doesn't matter. Sure, if your unit of account remains the USD, you will "lose value" if Coinbase were to ever default. The exact same.number of BTC is still unaffected. Don't tell me I don't understand something when it if clearly you who does not understand.
@_date: 2018-05-23 23:00:40
By the way, fractional reserves are only relevant in the current economic system because central banks have allowed gold to be "fractionally reserved" when the world moved away from gold as a currency and as a unit of account. The entire purpose of Bitcoin is to solve this problem (to become a SoV, then a medium of exchange, then a unit of account). If it ever achieves the status of Unit of Account, fractional reserves likely will not exist because a decentralized, sound money does not incentivize practices such as "fractional reserves". 
@_date: 2018-05-23 00:05:35
Jesus, no one understands how banking works. This is comical. If Coinbase runs fractional reserves, they are only putting themselves and their clients at risk. If Coinbase were to default, only Coinbase as a company and people dumb enough to bank with them would lose value. No one holding BTC otherwise would lose value, because there would still be the exact same amount of BTC in existence.
Edit: If this is confusing to you, it's because you still think in terms of FIAT/USD. Think about this in terms of BTC and it's very simple.

Shady for sure. But at least they are still offering 6.2% on the FIRST 25 BTC. Most individual investors would still get the 6.2%. I personally wouldn't put that much into a Blockfi account, but the risk/reward might be worth it to some people. 6.2% on 25 BTC is still over $500/month in interest. That's a nice chunk of change every month, even for people with $100k to invest.

Fidelity is launching a custodial platform for institutions and ultra-high-net-worth private wealth clients to house/secure Bitcoin (so they don't have to secure it themselves). Fidelity is NOT offering to sell Bitcoin to it's clients.

No FDIC or SIPC insurance, although Blockfi claims that Gemini has some sort of insurance. The extent of that insurance, and how it works, is unclear. 
Rehypothecation is a standard business practice with traditional banks- they take in your deposits and pay out an interest rate that they believe is sustainable based on the investing activities they will be using your money for. As of right now, there is evidence that suggests that BTC lending rates should be around 7-9%, which would indicate that the 6.2% APY is sustainable. Unfortunately, there is no visibility into Blockfi's rehypothecation activities to determine whether or not they will actually be able to overcome that hurdle rate.

Apologies- I responded like an asshole. Anyway, a government/sovereign entity (and it's fiat currency) are only as strong as the aggregate wealth of it's citizens. Any government can print and inflate the hell out of it's currency, but what it's doing is simply indirectly confiscating the wealth of it's citizens. When a new form of money/asset class is introduced into an economy, theoretically (especially with Bitcoin) the entire world has an equal opportunity to acquire this asset and "create" wealth where it didn't previously exist. The state actor's "skin in the game" comes from it's citizens' exposure to this potential new form of wealth. By banning/overregulating crypto exchanges, a government is effectively preventing its own country from participating in a potential global wealth transformation.

Can't tell if this is a legit question, or just trolling. Investing in bitcoin mining is not a scam. It's the furthest you can be from a scam as a Bitcoin enthusiast. As a miner, you are acquiring bitcoin through the expense of energy (electricity) and GPUs/ASICs. Just like gold, part of Bitcoin's value is tied to peoples' willingness to expend resources to produce (mine) it. I was simply pointing out the fact that the reason Bitcoin is being accepted for the purchase became clear once you realized the selling agent was a bitcoin miner.

This exact same post shows up almost every day in this sub. This is a simple supply/demand issue. If someone is holding BTC, they are reducing the circulating supply of BTC, thus positively affecting the price, which then drives demand. Spending your BTC might make BTC slightly more visible to others who come into contact with you in every day life, but it doesn't necessarily augment adoption of BTC. Holding BTC means you are part of the ecosystem and helping to secure the network; you are doing your part. This narrative about needing to spend your BTC to drive adoption is ridiculous and being driven by people who don't understand simple supply/demand economics.

Your 2 points are well-received. I addressed the first point when I stated that most of us believe that there is a very small chance that Bitcoin will fail (I acknowledge that it certainly could fall further). I didn't give these events probabilities because I don't know them. But If you forced me to use percentages, I'd probably guess that there is a &lt;1% chance of Bitcoin failing in the next 10 years, a \~25% chance it will fall to $2,000 in the next 6 months, and a 98% chance of climbing to $38,000 in the next 18-24 months. Thus, expected value/return of these three scenarios is very high (I understand I mixed timeframes so methodology is wonky, but you know what I mean). 
Regarding the Opportunity Cost, I didn't explicitly state what it would be because it would be different for everyone. However, what I am confident in is that most people are extremely unlikely to find an opportunity that could potentially provide the expected value/return that they would get from the scenario described above. Most people will keep their money in a bank account paying minimal interest, in which case the Opportunity Cost is easily calculated. Some may choose to invest in stocks/bonds/commodities/futures/real estate. Expected returns on those assets are nowhere near a \~8-10x return over the next 24 months.

Don't listen to these people telling you not to do it. I was an investment advisor for 11 years, hold my CFP and MBA, and I did this a few months ago. The capital markets are overbought. So is real estate. Volatility in the markets has skyrocketed, and the writing is on the wall: we're due for a huge correction in most markets, and there isn't really a safe haven to be found, other than in certain commodities, gold, and bitcoin. Bitcoin is proven to be uncorrelated to capital markets (see Tom Lee's FundStrat research) much like gold is. Combine this with the fact that a "100% match" up to 6% of your salary (increasingly rare to match so much) is probably not that much. Let's assume you max out your 401k at $16,500 each year, and you make 50k. The company is matching $3,000 to your 401k. At best you can expect maybe a 10% return on that money annually. More likely, the current environment predicts that the markets are correcting and you'll actually lose some of that money over the next 12-18 months. Well, if you have strong conviction (as I do) about what BTC will do in the next 12-18 months, that risk/reward is well worth it, in my opinion. If you put that same $16,500 into BTC over the next 12 months, it only has to have a 30% return to equal what you'd have in the 401k (16500+3000+10% return). Also, most people talking about a "tax benefit" don't understand how a 401k works. Pre-tax contributions are tax-deferred, not tax-free. I've been telling people for years that this country has a debt problem, and the best way to reduce debt is to increase taxes. People paying 35% federal taxes today might find themselves paying 50% or more on income in the future (when you start taking distributions from your 401k, IRA, deferred comp, pension, etc). 
edit: Additionally, generally people are contributing to their 401k with money they, by definition, do not need for current expenses. 401k is a long-term investment. So is BTC, but (IMO and most other people on this subreddit) with far greater upside. Ask yourself a question: when you turn age 65, or 70 1/2 or whatever, will 15k in today's capital markets be worth more or less than 15k in today's BTC?

This is an ignorant comment. Smart money looks for uncorrelated assets. Bitcoin is *likely* uncorrelated to equities, so it's certainly possible money can flow from equities to crypto the same way money flows into fixed income and gold.

Jesus, who the fuck wrote this garbage? This is written by a 13 year old. Also, the word you're looking for is "High Frequency Traders", not cartels. Fucking idiot.

What a fucking moron. I could have answered that question when I was 7.

What? This is a nonsensical statement. "Adoption follows stability" is not even remotely accurate. Adoption is a result of innovation and progress, not a result of "stability".

Maybe comparing these simulations to ones based on the data 6 months prior (June 2017-December 2017) would have provided a nice contrast. Your 90% confidence interval would probably be something like 800-1600 billion market cap.

You're literally talking about a sample size of 6. There is no predictive power to this data.

I understand. I was giving you my opinion. Don't waste your time thinking about this, it is not significant. Perhaps when there are 40+ data points to consider, you may be able to find some relationship/correlation.

You feel scammed because you *were* scammed by altcoins and their shiny marketing collateral. Hopefully you've learned your lesson. BTC &gt; crypto.
@_date: 2019-05-11 00:43:00
I commented because you think you were scammed by Bitcoin. A scam is something that is based on fraudulent claims. Bitcoin has never claimed to be at a certain price, or any price for that matter. Price is simply volatility in the perceived value. You can't be "scammed" by the price. What you can be scammed by is the promise of something that Bitcoin doesn't do...but Bitcoin doesn't claim to be anything other than a store of value and maybe eventually an MoE and Currency. Every single alt coin claims to have a use case, but none of them havr lived up to their claims. Maybe if you were referring to an alt coin, your claim of being scammed would be justified. In other words, you "scammed" yourself by buying BTC before fully understanding what the consequences were/are.

This will just never work. People aren't going to deposit real value into their Facebook accounts. Incredibly, Facebook actually *overestimates* how dumb people are.

This post is a fucking mess. Poorly written with terrible grammar and inaccurate information, but spaced out as if that white space alone will somehow make this a powerful message. It's not.

Wrong. Sounds like you need to do some more research. "Outdated" lol. Keep going down that rabbit hole and you'll start to get it. Otherwise, just stop talking.

Data is biased. 7% to 8% "of people surveyed". It's highly likely that the "people surveyed" were engaged in the survey due to their interest in cryptocurrencies already. Thus, they've polled a biased sample. 
It's likely the actual percentage of people around the globe who own Bitcoin is no greater than 2%. 2% of the world is \~150 million people.

There's no proof that exchanges are selling/trading more Bitcoin than they have/are in existence (fractional reserve banking). What exchanges and most institutions are doing is betting on BTC futures through BITMEX, which can artificially affect BTC prices presently. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 22:36:38
I'm not suggesting that it's a good or bad thing. I was simply suggesting that 7-8% is (likely) magnitudes greater than what the actual adoption rate is currently. Bitcoin is certainly still used/owned primarily by the rich, the "intelligentsia" and the "optioned poor" (and even then, it's a very small fraction of those groups). The people who took the survey probably either belong to or are close to those communities. 90% of the world's population do not belong to those classes/communities, and likely have barely head of Bitcoin. My guess is somewhere between .5% to 1.5% of the world owns some cryptocurrency.

Are you really so dense that you can't overcome decimals and units? Literally anyone could make up their own unit for whatever Bitcoin size they want:
.01 BTC = one dinglehopper
.0001 BTC = one skywalker
.0000001 BTC = one maximulisanidiot
Do you really think humans are innovative enough to create a protocol like Bitcoin, but they can't overcome something as simple as how to divide it's units? C'mon man, use your head.
@_date: 2018-12-02 22:01:23
Nice post. It's ironic because you're speculating just as much as everyone else. You have no clue what will happen, and your 2 months of research won't change that.

The fact that you're trying to logically justify/explain what CSW did is actually proving OPs point. You're probably a "normal" person who is trying to explain away this behavior. The problem is that the behavior is erratic and unpredictable because CSW is probably, in fact, a narcissistic sociopath.
