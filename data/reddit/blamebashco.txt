Nope. Pools regulate the number of shares you send. It's really just feel-good for metrics, you could have one accept a day and you would still get paid the same (though the payout variance would be higher). The real metric you want to look at is hash rate, the rest is all but irrelevant.

It was both private key generation and ECDSA nonces. 
If you have a weak nonce the address does not need to be reused to be stolen from.

Armory needs Bitcoin Core (30GB + 6 hours) and it's own indexes (40GB + 6 hours). To do that every time you boot up would be moronic. For just signing messages without any block chain data, this would be doable though, and not even that difficult.

You can with inrush limiting, but that makes your power supplies more expensive.

Yes. 


Not safely. Armory will eventually have an SPV-like mode which means you don't need to have a copy of the block chain hanging around on the online computer either, but it isn't public yet.

That's a picture of a raspberry Pi Running cgminer not Bitcoin Core. One has almost zero memory and CPU footprint, the other is extremely arduous to run. The Pi is unequivocally unsuitable for this task, you want a small hardware node use an ODROID-U3 which has significantly more suitable specifications and a similar footprint.

That's correct. It takes significantly longer to verify than to sign.

What shortage? There's less now than before, but I wouldn't call that an issue. 
@_date: 2014-12-08 14:26:25
Sure, but then you could claim to burn them to fees when you just mined the block themselves.

Cold is by definition not internet connected. An internet connected cold wallet is an oxymoron.

Be careful blindly trusting new pieces of cryptographic hardware. There's some less than impressive code running on some devices, you'd be better to wait for some cryptographic review before trusting your money to them.

It's between 1 and approximately 2^(256)-2^32. Higher would be invalid for secp256k1.

Yet another reason JavaScript shouldn't be used for financial software.

When fixing a related issue, the developers at blockchain.info made a copy and paste error which reduced the number of possible outputs in their random number generator. Rather than 340282366920938463463374607431768211456 different possibilities it was only one of 256. Due to how this random number generator was used anybody who made a new private key during that time made a very predicable one, meaning that anybody paying attention could guess it and steal from them.

If you set this value differently on even two different nodes the chain would fork, as you could have blocks valid to some people and not to others. You can't just decide not to process blocks, so the clear answer is that the Raspberry Pi is completely unsuitable for this task (it's basically a huge GPU and a toy CPU coming along for the ride).

Sony is well aware at least.

It's always night time somewhere in the world so daily variations aren't going to be a problem. You can't turn on and off megawatts of miners anyway. Thermal cycling destroys hardware, and your power supplier will come knocking on your door with a bill for their melted substations. 
Actually turning on a large farm of ASICs is a very manual process that involves turning each one on individually to avoid very large inrush currents in the switchmode power supplies. If you just flicked the master breaker on you would blow either damage something upstream or destroy your own distribution equipment.

You'd run out of carbon in the universe to make the paper with, so put that out of your mind as a practical problem. Much easier to use a cup full of the stuff to make a carbon fiber spanner to whack whichever person you were planning on stealing from on the head. Just don't cut it or sand it without respiratory protection, it's a known carcinogen.
