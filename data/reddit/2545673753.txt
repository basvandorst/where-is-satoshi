Oh dear.


Hmm, you definitely need to read closer in the wikis here which talk about this. e.g Fractional reserve banking and things like that.

I doubt you'll be rich because it sounds like you're so led by emotions, such as spite and greed that you'll either bail long before that happened even if it did or wouldn't sell before the bubble collapses. Thus you'll only be able to talk about the time when bitcoin were worth $100k and how much money you could have had.
Indeed, depending the price you got your bitcoin you might already be in that position now.
And really, that you care so much about the $ value of bitcoin shows that you don't actually see it as intrinsically valuable in the way that you do for dollars. You're more or less agreeing with the critics and proving their point.
Otherwise you'd say "I've got x bitcoin!" - you know, if I had $50m in the bank I wouldn't be fretting too much about what it "hits" - I'd have 50 fucking million bitches - it doesn't need to hit things.

I imagine there are a fair amount waiting in hope for it to hit whatever price they bought in at, back when it was close to $5k, so they can get their money back and bail.

Well, no. There may be a few, but it's not a significant number compared with where you can spend dollars.


Well, when you claim "many vendors" clearly they should do their own research if you are indicative of the level of honesty and reasonable statements coming from bitcoin punters.
