This guy is being sarcastic, anyone can use bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-01 21:36:38
If you trust the key that it is signed with then it's fine. It is saying that because the key itself isn't signed by a trusted party.
@_date: 2015-05-06 21:02:49
If you need any development help let me know, it's a great idea.
@_date: 2015-01-11 18:49:33
I would be interested in helping you. I don't have the most experience but hopefully I can help.
@_date: 2015-01-03 03:54:04

@_date: 2015-01-02 22:23:17
Would you mind saying why? Thanks for the tip!
@_date: 2015-01-20 16:40:34
It would be better if they told people how Bitcoin really works not some fake stuff!
@_date: 2015-01-29 21:28:58
No thats fine.
@_date: 2015-01-13 02:20:29
Yep that sounds like an issue.
@_date: 2015-01-07 23:57:06
For my main wallet I use blockchain.info it has a website and an android app. For storing large ammounts use paper wallets.
@_date: 2015-01-04 22:58:15
That's very helpful! :)

@_date: 2015-03-07 20:21:18
@_date: 2015-03-25 15:13:10
I like this idea, let me know if you need any help with it.
@_date: 2015-02-27 01:28:59
You can see transactions on any address but not who owns that address.
@_date: 2015-02-24 20:51:37
Badass! Will pass it on.

@_date: 2015-02-23 16:53:40
@_date: 2015-03-27 15:51:47
