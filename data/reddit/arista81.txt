I'm certainly not taking the earnings from other people.  If I buy a Bitcoin for $1 in 2010 and sell it to someone else today for $11,000 who did I take money from?  In both transactions, the person I dealt with traded with me voluntarily.  The earnings occurred because the Bitcoin itself is more valuable and in higher demand.

Sorry, that is not true.  When feminists say that women make 77 cents for every dollar men make, they are comparing all women working full time to all men working full time.  After you correct for hours worked per week, career field, etc, the gap virtually disappears.

Ideally we would live in a society where the government gets out of the way, allowing business and the private sector to flourish so that every able bodied person who wants a job can find one that pays well.  Society is much better off when people can pay their own bills (like health insurance) as opposed to having government tax others to pay them.
As for disability, many people who collect it are not actually disabled. They have obesity, depression, mood disorders, etc. Also, being disabled doesn't necessarily mean you can't work.  Most office jobs can be done without the use of your legs for example.  Did you know the number of people collecting disability rose 50% over the past ten years?  Do you really think that many more people have become disabled, or maybe the Obama admin just became more lax about enforcement.

Start paying attention. Nonsense like this already is happening all the time. For example, the so-called gender wage gap. Men choose careers that pay more than the careers women choose.  As a result men earn more money. But the left looks at the disparity and assumes that discrimination and sexism is the only explanation for the wage gap.
Another example: banks give out loans based on borrowers' incomes and credit scores. Because racial minorities on average have lower incomes they don't qualify as often as whites do for loans.  The government sees the disparity and assumes the banks must be racist and the government fines and sues the banks to force them to give more loans to minorities.

Maybe not directly right away.  But many of the people who buy the coins at auction will then transfer them to an exchange to sell them, which will depress the price.

Same result: downward pressure on price.  If the government were not selling the bitcoins to the asset management firm, the firm would have had to buy from one of the exchanges which would have put upward pressure on prices on the exchange.  If they are buying from the government instead, that upward pressure on the exchanges won't exist.  Any way you slice it, someone dumping $25 million worth of Bitcoin on the market will make the price lower than it otherwise would have been.  Higher supply = lower price. Econ 101.

Your argument is based on Karl Marx's discredited Labor Theory of Value.  The value of something is based on what people are willing to pay for it, not how much labor went into creating it. I can spend 100 hours producing an ugly piece of art, but if no one likes it, I might only be able to sell it for $10. Meanwhile, someone could spend an hour on a paiting and sell it for $1 million.

$5 is the exception? Do you have a source for that?  I've been looking at this chart.  Is this chart wrong?

Litecoin certainly does have lower fees. You can see [here]( that the fees average about 8 cents. My understanding is that this is mostly because Litecoin is used so little that the fees are still low, basically where Bitcoin was a few years ago.
Gold bugs like Peter Schiff have never liked Bitcoin because it's not backed up by anything tangible like gold.  The counter-argument has always been that Bitcoin's value is derived from its utility as a medium of exchange.  If that utility goes away because the fees are $5, $10, $20 or more, what utility are you left with?  Not much I think.  Bitcoin is only a good store of value if the value stays the same or keeps going up.  If people realize it's no good as a medium of exchange and the price starts going down, holders will bolt.  That's why it's so important I think for them to solve the fee problem.
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:00:41
Of course I have, and I've also seen the charts that show an even faster increase in transaction fees. Demand and usage of bitcoin seem to cause both the price and fees to increase, but at some point demand (and thus price) will hit a wall if the fees make bitcoin unusable as a currency.
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:21:27
Why would bitcoin go up from here?  Average transaction fees are at $7 and climbing.
Do you really think there will be demand for a currency that costs $12 per transaction?  $20?  $30?
@_date: 2017-11-06 07:46:53
Maybe, but in the meantime, I think lack of scalability will put downward pressure on the price. I'm waiting on the sidelines until I see a real solution to the scaling problem.

@_date: 2017-11-06 06:53:52
I see more and more folks making the "store of value" argument for Bitcoin.  This is a red flag IMO. For years people argued that Bitcoin's value was based on its scarcity and its utility as a medium of exchange. As it gets more and more use as a medium of exchange, the price per Bitcoin would naturally increase. Makes sense.
However, with average transaction fees hitting $5 or more, I don't hear too many people making the "medium of exchange" argument anymore.  Instead I hear the "store of value" argument.  The problem is if Bitcoin is ultimately useless as a medium of exchange because of high fees, it doesn't have much or even any instrinsic value.  A store of value only looks good if the price is stable or keeps going up. If the price starts to seriously drop, the "store of value" argument goes out the window and then what arguments remain for why it's a good investment? Not many I would say.

What about reports like these that claim that a maximum of only 3 or 4 Bitcoin transactions are possible per second?
According to this chart, we are pretty much at that level already.  300,000 transactions/day = 3.47/second

They probably just switched back to cash.  Alts like Litecoin are used so little by the public  that it's not worth a merchant getting set up to accept them.

That's downloading, processing, and validating a new 100GB block *every 10 minutes*.  Seems kind of undoable.
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:09:15
Bitcoin has had a great run, but unless they figure out a scaling solution soon, people will switch more and more to altcoins for faster speeds and lower fees.  Yes you can keep your money out of the banks by holding bitcoin, but that is true of many other assets too: real estate, precious metals, etc, so be prepared for the strong possibility of losses if you hold bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:10:56
Maybe some folks are overpaying fees, and maybe you can still get your transaction confirmed for only 15 cents, but we still have a problem where each block can only hold a limited number of transactions, and if Bitcoin becomes used more and more, 15 cents will no longer be sufficient, right? The stats I've seen indicate that the network can only handle 3-4 transactions per second.  


In the video at the top Andreas actually mentions that many merchants have stopped accepting Bitcoin.  Whereas a few years ago the fees were only a couple of cents, now the fees are 100x as high, so it sounds like Bitcoin is being used less and less for day to day transactions.
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:01:51
If it's so easy, why haven't any of those solutions been implemented yet? Average transaction fees are already sitting at more than $5. People can get around the fees by offering a low fee from their wallet, and the transaction gets processed when the network is less busy in the middle of the night, but what happens when all the blocks are full of transactions 24/7? $10 fees? $20 fees? We need a real scaling solution ASAP.
Edit: Fine, it's not easy. But if it's doable, let's do it already.

Or you could just invest in the stock market yourself and get in on the action rather than stealing from others.
Keeping stock market gains in the private sector is more beneficial economically than redistributing those gains to people like you. Keeping the money in the stock market allows it to be re-invested in productive activities that produce goods and services and improve everyone's quality of life. Give the money to you and it will be spent on immediate consumption and provide no long term benefit to anyone.

This meme is just wishful thinking. A government can shut down exchanges. Without exchanges it becomes exponentially more difficult for the average person to exchange fiat for crypto. Without widespread adoption, bitcoin would have trouble breaking out into much more than just a curiosity for coding nerds.
@_date: 2017-10-28 16:39:32
Banking and credit card systems process thousands of times more transactions than bitcoin each day, so of course they will have more infrastructure and use plenty of resources.  The issues is the electricity usage PER TRANSACTION.  The stats I've seen show that a bitcoin transaction requires about 5,000 times more electricity than a credit card transaction.  This is a major hindrance that will hold Bitcoin back unless it is adressed in a major way.

Capital gains taxes mean the profits are split 80/20 between individuals/government (assuming all the holders are in the USA and there is 100% tax compliance, which we all know isn't happening). Compare that to a 0/100 split if the government had held onto the bitcoins the whole time.

Or you could look at it another way. By selling the bitcoin early, it means individuals in the private economy were able to enjoy the profits rather than the government.  
The government already does way too much.  They shouldn't also be in the business of speculating on the future value of volatile assets.
