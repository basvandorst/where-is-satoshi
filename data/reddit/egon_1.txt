Core and Classic is based on the same code. 
Classic supports 2MB to include more transactions in one block, whereas Core sticks to its one 1 MB block size. 
Nevertheless, to include more transactions, Core proposed SegWit as an "Add-On" feature to the existing code. 
Which again requires from all Bitcoin stakeholders to adjust their code to benefit from SegWit transactions. 
In addition, SegWit sets also the ground for future bells and whistles features (LT). Latest Core version is more about features than improving reliability.
It's comparable to an OS upgrade. Maintaining old code and updating with add ons/ service packs which may increase complexity for future upgrades or applications. Or installing a fresh system with backward compatibility with its pros and cons.
**Centralized** miners have also their say. As mining becomes increasingly competitive, some look for additional revenue streams. Miners are in the commodity business in selling block space. There is an incentive to keep it low, but competition will come up with other solutions ( payment channels) to reduce onchain transactions. Bit short term thinking.  Like the OPEC in the old days. IMO that will change.

Bob's USDs stay in the U.S. (Circle's bank account) while Circle sends Bitcoin to his relatives Circle wallet (or any other bitcoin wallet). It is up to Bob's relatives, if they want to convert the bitcoins into GBP.

Valid points. Current examples are welcome.
@_date: 2015-12-31 17:40:13
In this scenario you are correct, under these conditions they both have a USD wallet and stay in the fiat world (no price volatility). However, assuming Bob has a relative in the UK, the story might look different and Bob uses indeed Bitcoin as a vehicle to move fiat money.

Thanks for your valuable input. You may have to agree that the BTC price has been quite stable the last weeks/months and there is arguably correlation with the Greece news.

Payment startups, such as Stripe, Braintree iZettle, Sqaure etc.Coinbase or Bips etc. are predestinated to offer such kind of smart and cheap payment solutions (maybe not Square).  
These guys have the know-how and licenses to handle payment transactions, and Bitcoin would just perfectly circumvent credit card networks. In the end, the merchant would still get his/her fiat money, but cheaper.

*Developers who have integrated Braintree’s software development kit will also be able to add Bitcoin to their payment methods.

The issue with these exchanges are that they provide convenience, and that is their USP. We need a competitive alternative solution. The average Joe/Jane is not able to secure bitcoins within cold storages. It's too geeky and cumbersome. And there is the fear to store bitcoins on your PC/Mac, which could be stolen.  I would urge the bitcoin community to address this issue asap that is also accessible for developing countries.

I have a similar case. I don't wanna show geeky videos or blogs. Something more tangible and serious business material, to showcase the  benefits of bitcoin. So far, I have this report from PwC 
He knows what bitcoin is, and again not. There are questions about who is controlling the minted bitcoins, who is providing/controlling future bitcoins. Does the founder of bitcoin have a backdoor to control etc.

Valid points. But the broader implications are that other (large) players will have it on their radars, and probably joining the bandwagon soon. Most firms are second movers. They wait and see how others will excel or fail.

I think this explains the whole bitcoin miner industry:
" Yet when he’s asked about 21e6, Srinivasan goes silent. A PR representative interrupts to say that the company is in stealth mode. People familiar with 21e6, who asked not to be named because they weren’t authorized to speak on the matter, say the company plans to keep its superfast computers for itself, just as a hedge fund might trade on its own proprietary algorithms. It wants to build the world’s largest Bitcoin mine—a virtual money printing machine"
@_date: 2015-05-03 22:39:48
@_date: 2014-11-01 22:30:32
From my personal view:
* industry mining farms (KNC &amp; co) have to recoup their costs, and have to invest in new machines.
* big players (financial institutions) are driving the price down, to buy them cheap again. (Have a longterm view!)
* more merchants are joining the bitcoin bandwagon, i.e., they convert them into fiat money, pressuring the BTC price
* early adopters and crowdfunded project (ethereum) sold off  their bitcoins.
But the good news (really good news): we have more and different users than ever before, we have great projects in the pipeline (sidechains) that will create self enforcing networks effects, i.e., the demand  for Bitcoin will rise again. 
So, it's a temporary issue. Get a good tea and relax!

Sorry to say that, but this is not competitive at all compared to most national legacy payments systems and kills new use cases. 
* Bitcoin was never meant to be a pure settlement layer system for a small group of people. Read the [paper]( The more it gets expensive, transactions get pushed to 2nd centralized layer services.
* If more transactions are on 2nd layers, there is the risk that the 1st layer becomes obsolete or less attractive to use.
* If more transactions are on 2nd layers services, we need less miners. KnC is probably the only one that realize it and mines for its survival. Others admire the fast approaching iceberg in front of them. 
* If Bitcoin cannot scale on-chain, we have to rewrite Satoshi's paper.

Bill Gates' answer: 
Bitcoin is an exciting new technology. For our Foundation work we are doing digital currency to help the poor get banking services. We don't use bitcoin specifically for two reasons. One is that the poor shouldn't have a currency whose value goes up and down a lot compared to their local currency. Second is that if a mistake is made in who you pay then you need to be able to reverse it so anonymity wouldn't work
Overall financial transactions will get cheaper using the work we do and Bitcoin related approaches.
Making sure that it doesn't help terrorists is a challenge for all new technology.

He/she didn't get the memo that there is an artificially created fee market lately that pushes users to off-chain solutions, which contradicts with Satoshi's paper of pure peer-to-peer transactions. This in turn creates unrest in the bitcoin community. 
Meanwhile, developers develop hard forks to overcomes these hurdles/stuberness/egos as they are not patient or not willing to agree **how** to increase the blocksize that does not disrupt the network. Nevertheless, all agree that 1 MB is not enough. In other words, both want to reach the moon, but they cannot agree on the rocket fuel type.

For me it looks quite anti competitive behaviour, as you fulfill KYC and AML requirements. I would suggest that all European bitcoin companies should unite, and speak with one voice to regulators to address this issue.
Or create an open bank (I think 5 mio is required within EU) that makes it almost impossible to be blocked  from national payment networks.

We always forget the bigger picture and get easily distracted. Remember, bitcoin is still young, but it gets better and better. Bitcoin has not the intention to disrupt the current financial system. Rather, it wants to provide fincial access to everyone on this planet that cannot afford to have a proper bank account like at Barclays, because you are too risky or [lost game]( **(Yes Simon, I am referring to you)**.
IMO, nondiscriminatory access to a financial system is a human right that should not depend on a debit card.

Looking it from the "end-user" perspective, Bitcoin has to behave instant to replicate/replace other payment instruments to be a true alternative. Everyone wants Bitcoin to succeed. That means  that someone has to take the risk or the technology has to evolve to enable instant settlements. 
To survive longterm, $0.05 fees or more isn't going to fly. I don't buy it that decentralized systems cannot compete with centralized ones fee-wise. Ideally users do not pay fees at all (like Circle users). 
I don't believe that Bitcoin is made for 5-10 million users. Thunder or Lightning or probably needed solutions to reduce transactions on-chains. 
@_date: 2015-10-10 20:15:45

If the cost of a product or service is rising (compared to existing ones), something is not working properly. The argument that decentralized services cannot compete with centralized ones is very weak and showing a lack of substantiated arguments. 
I truly believe that (Bitcoin) transactions should have negligible or no fees for end users. Companies have to come up with other value added services on top, or make use of technology that reduces the fee pressure. [RBF]( is just a symptom of the problem and not the solution for the problem.
Interestingly, we have solutions that can tackle these (fee) problems, but some people prefer the perfect solution instead a good solution. This takes time (especially in decentralized systems) while other innovative services take over by being cheaper and faster.
