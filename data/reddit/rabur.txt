Is there a printable version?

Well, without a bitcoin node you can't listen for transactions on your own. You can either:
* setup bitcoind locally and listen for transactions
* use chain.com [hooks](
* use [blockchain]( websocket
* use [blockchain]( merchant API, though it is not super-reliable (sometimes laggy)
I am personally interested if there are some better solutions.

Can you tell us more about your startup?

I believe BIP70 is what may help in this situation.    
    
It makes the merachant responsible for broadcasting the payment transaction instead of the payer. You may have no internet connection, and transact via eg Bluetooth.

AFAIK Bitcoin Devs try to separate as much as possible deamon and wallet features. Though, if you hold private key, you can import it later into some wallet.

Hashing is irreversible. Even if you know, you have to find hash 0000000000000000001, inputs will be different (time and transactions will differ, see hashMerkleRoot). Therefore it will still be safe, and darn hard (except for the SHA weaknesses).

This doesn't look like a reliable source of information. Can you tell us a bit more about this website?
@_date: 2014-06-26 18:35:39
I believe so. Though, without Internet connection, merchant can never be sure if inputs haven't been spent.    
Maybe mesh networks could be solution here...

Faster international payment settlements and no political-driven exclusion from the financial markets (eg EU trying to ban Russia from the SWIFT network).

How about my leg?

There is only one ledger - the one with the longer history (with more blocks). Sometimes there can be two or more ledgers with different transactions at the same time and with the same amount of blocks. It won't last long, since one of them will have more miners (hashing power) working on it, hence solving new block faster. This is why it is recommended to wait for few confirmations - to be pretty sure there are no more competing ledgers. 
@_date: 2014-05-14 14:48:44
Is there possibility of any desktop wallet incorporating this?
@_date: 2014-03-16 22:22:33
Someone would have to cashout from paper wallet anyway - for their own safety.

Those scam artists would have to gain access to btc-e.nz domain (which is known to belong to btc-e) and to their twitter account.  
   
Highly unlikely.

Do you plan on adding the portfolio feature or is it just price listings? Would you consider adding fiat currencies and some commodities (gold, silver)? I would happily pay for addons like that.     
PS. Contrary to some other people here, I really like the name :)
@_date: 2017-11-15 10:41:22
Perfect! Question about commodities still remain tho... There is couple of good portfolio apps out there, none does support gold or silver.

* You own the asset, not the issuer.
* Any party can integrate.
* Token can not be freezed. It can only be made unsupported by one of the parties.
* There is no downtime.
* Even if original issuer doesn't exist anymore, other parties can still use the token.
