Well I just bought some right now so if the value goes up does that mean I'm not getting what I paid for now or what? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:52:19
Any other recommendations, there aren't any around here.
@_date: 2015-06-25 02:38:46
There is no link in the right hand corner even when I relog in 
@_date: 2015-06-27 23:47:41
@_date: 2015-06-27 18:31:58
I think you can just make a regular post, I'm glad you like my ideas feel free to post them :) I think it would be fun to see someone do these.
@_date: 2015-06-28 17:37:45
You should!
@_date: 2015-06-28 17:39:24
Every month a random person is chosen to receive money basically everyone you enters is supposed to give a dollar to the winner, I however every month give out dollars to people there to people who can't afford to :)
@_date: 2015-06-25 06:12:11
They claim it was canceled the same day which is BS. If that ever happens you guys should send an alert.
After I redo my order I'm canceling my account and will not be recommending coinbase to anyone anymore, anytime someone asks what they should use and I see it, explicitly I'll tell them to avoid coinbase. 
Third time I've had issues this is ridiculous. One of the same issues still persists. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 17:40:45
Every month a random person is chosen to receive at least a dollar from everyone who enters, I give away several dollars every month to people who might not be able to give a dollar. It's the HandHookDollarama :D
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:14:26
Thanks a ton! 
I'm planning on converting to vertcoin which is dropping in price right now so I wasn't sure how that worked.
@_date: 2015-06-27 18:33:18
A couple of yours match mine.
@_date: 2015-06-26 19:59:11
1. Record yourself asking to pay with Bitcoin somewhere that doesn't accept it.
2. Record yourself teaching a kid about Bitcoin.
3. Draw a Bitcoin bank, as if it were a banking building.
4. Make flyers that have some coin on them and hand them out.
5. Live on Bitcoin for a week.
6. Donate to a cause using Bitcoin.
7. Write a list of places that offer discounts if you use Bitcoin.
8. Offer 3 people 10 dollars in Bitcoin and tell us what they say.
9. Show a local Bitcoin accepted here sign.
10. Buy something there with Bitcoin and tell us the reaction of the person when you asked to pay in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-27 23:48:55
Let me know when you post it up, I love Bitcoin and if I win this coin the next giveaway I do in will be bigger than usual :D
@_date: 2014-11-28 03:26:45
@_date: 2015-05-13 06:56:12
Discounts for those who pay in Bitcoin seems to help, only if you actively want/prefer Bitcoin over fiat though.
@_date: 2015-05-09 23:12:26
The government wouldn't use Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-05-07 22:38:32
This is awesome! :)
@_date: 2015-05-15 01:17:13
No need for thanks :)
It's awesome that people share their talent on the cloud, you deserve it! 
I'm over here freestyling horribly haha
@_date: 2015-05-12 15:24:31
Let them send you dogecoin on weselldoges (they can use PayPal to buy) and trade it for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-05-06 16:50:26
I would use the crap out of that app for real.
@_date: 2015-05-15 01:14:13
Dollar coming your way on sound cloud via changetip :)
@_date: 2015-05-14 06:28:44
FoldApp, Purse.io, and ChangeTip honestly especially after explaining it can explain you can exchange it for "real" money on Coinbase.
@_date: 2015-05-09 00:41:15
Not even mad lol
@_date: 2015-05-15 01:18:14
Remember to connect your account :) I just sent it 
@_date: 2015-01-14 07:36:34
Man. -pats your back-
@_date: 2015-01-27 04:32:57
If things don't work out and you are feeling down then message me.
Some people can do drastic things when all they really need is someone to talk to :)
@_date: 2015-01-13 02:20:18
High hopes there lol shoo too risky for me. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 02:25:38
I feel more safe with idevices since things are screened more but even then.
@_date: 2015-01-13 06:31:30
Search the subreddit 
@_date: 2015-01-28 02:22:23
Clever way to get cash
@_date: 2015-01-16 08:08:39
Prove it by tipping me your coins, I'll tip them back ;)
In all seriousness, did you really do it man?! I didn't think you would!
@_date: 2015-01-10 22:08:47
Ah true.
I'm going for it just this time since I'm new and it's just 2 dollars.
@_date: 2015-01-10 04:39:19
Don't forget about libraries! :)
@_date: 2015-01-12 05:52:20
We all gotta start somewhere. I'm fairly new also.
@_date: 2015-01-11 21:48:00
I'm new but I think you can use PayPal to buy some. Search PayPal Bitcoin in this subreddit and something should pop up.
@_date: 2015-01-20 03:43:14
A name for the coin?
@_date: 2015-01-26 18:37:17
But Visa cards and by the bit that way?
@_date: 2015-01-26 08:48:09
If you want to see success, use the currency as currency.
It's okay to hold some but use it too.
@_date: 2015-01-11 23:27:14
What makes you think it wasn't theirs?
I hope that person doesn't take flack because of this post if they are the owner.
@_date: 2015-01-11 10:24:07
I am maybe almost a week in and I pretty much know nothing but I traded some bits for litecoin because I hear diversity is good.
I have no idea what I'm doing really haha
Quick question, does my bits in the changetip site gain and lose value?
@_date: 2015-01-15 00:44:52
Nah but just in case I forget 
@_date: 2015-01-27 01:36:03
I like online wallets more than cold storage ones. It just feels easier to be able to log in to a website.
I know I'll catch heck for this but I've been keeping my coins in exchanges.
I would definitely move stuff to an online wallet. Heck I wish there was a wallet that held doge/bit/and LTC
There might be one but I'm pretty new to this stuff.
@_date: 2015-01-27 02:24:53
@_date: 2015-01-10 20:20:35
I just did it but not as a reply to your comment.
@_date: 2015-01-14 06:35:51
I wish!
@_date: 2015-01-26 08:55:10
It's all good :)
@_date: 2015-01-26 08:51:12
Man I wish I had the cash to go in on these prices. Hell if I could get through my classes with out my books I would.
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:28:52
Yes, I know.
@_date: 2015-01-17 00:37:12
What's that?
@_date: 2015-01-28 21:10:11
In America &lt;----
@_date: 2015-01-12 01:50:09
Hey how's it going badass
@_date: 2015-01-11 02:45:15
I can buy whole lite coins instead of two dollars in bits besides can you guys just leave me alone earlier I said I already had some bits.
@_date: 2015-01-15 20:21:13
4 cents 
@_date: 2015-01-12 20:23:43
Yeah that's right!
@_date: 2015-01-10 04:35:54
Or they can donate both to charity?
@_date: 2015-01-25 07:10:07
@_date: 2015-01-13 22:43:12
You bought at 13 of course you aren't panicked.
@_date: 2015-01-13 02:11:45
Student loan? On something that's kind of risky?
I wish I had the balls.
I'm over here dabbling with cheap litecoin.
@_date: 2015-01-26 08:15:32
I parodize songs as a hobby! :)
Maybe I'll give this a go.
@_date: 2015-01-26 17:46:54
:( -hugs-
@_date: 2015-01-15 04:25:36
In the last 2 years? Did you not sell when it went back up?
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:41:23
Have you sold yet?
@_date: 2015-01-27 04:06:31
It's happening to them too :/
@_date: 2015-01-12 02:40:39
Thank you for the video!
Are you into litecoin at all? 
@_date: 2015-01-11 04:06:23
Thank you so much, I truly appreciate it. I hope you enjoyed my story.
@_date: 2015-01-26 17:28:10
Wow that's crazy!
I wish I had that luck 
@_date: 2015-01-23 02:10:11
Hahah nice one!
@_date: 2015-01-11 04:19:38
Awesome! If you have any links to that stuff I would read it :D I tend to write supernatural stuff.
@_date: 2015-01-15 18:34:41
And past charts show that things have gone up after crashes also 
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:17:14
@_date: 2015-01-26 18:43:38
I know it's just the price climbing that gets me
@_date: 2015-01-25 06:01:44
Holding is what is bringing it down. If you believed in the currency you would actually use it as such and help drive it up by buying more over time while spending.
@_date: 2015-01-15 20:47:46
@_date: 2015-01-12 03:58:13
I don't think telling new people about how a lot of people lost their money is the right way to go about it.
@_date: 2015-01-15 04:42:27
Spending helps though. Use the currency too even if you're just investing to help it grow.
@_date: 2015-01-29 00:57:04
@_date: 2015-01-12 06:45:10
I probably won't.
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:07:09
If this is legit people let me know. I'm new and started last week. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 23:13:14
How much you paid for them is a huge reason though.
You bought at 13 some people bought at much more and no longer are profiting like you still are.
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:36:38
Buying low is good if you believe it's going to go back up.
@_date: 2015-01-10 22:24:24
I can afford to lose 2 dollars on litecoin.
@_date: 2015-01-12 02:01:48
I feel like such a newb but I am learning. (You definitely inspire me haha).
@_date: 2015-01-15 09:15:27
@_date: 2015-01-12 23:28:21
@_date: 2015-01-28 21:13:39
Try them with doge not bitcoin
@_date: 2015-01-26 08:16:39
Good luck! :)
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:23:12
I'm still debating it.
@_date: 2015-01-30 23:03:03
Wait until the super rich people buy it.
@_date: 2015-01-10 23:32:09
I'm using BTC-E and I'm trading some bits to buy coins.
Everyone is kind of bashing but I'm new and it's very little money. It's fine though because I'm new and maybe it grows or maybe it doesn't, it's just a couple of dollars.
@_date: 2015-05-13 04:36:08
Awesome luck! :)
@_date: 2015-01-10 22:38:33
Thank you! :)
@_date: 2015-01-21 16:33:01
That's your choice. 
Learn about it and decide. 
Search posts in the subreddit.
Are planning to spend the coin?
@_date: 2015-01-09 10:13:59
Any Bitcoin exclusive things to purchase?
@_date: 2015-01-17 11:12:03
Splitting up the sub would be pretty dumb.
People are worried about proves right now, it's to be expected.
@_date: 2015-01-12 00:29:45
I think Bitcounts would be a great name for it! :D
@_date: 2015-01-10 23:32:41
Thank you.
I truly appreciate the positivity.
@_date: 2015-01-25 20:56:54
Honestly? Probably a lot.
Where's my ten bucks lol
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:40:45
Sell now and buy more for less in a couple days or wait it out.
If you sell now you are taking a loss.
@_date: 2015-01-28 09:20:24
You can use my wallet, I'll send it back I promise :)
@_date: 2015-01-13 09:36:31
Awesome for spreading the good word! :) 
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:24:12
I definitely would!
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:33:57
I'm hoping for lower, if it's crashing might as well go all the way so I can get those cheap coins.
@_date: 2015-01-13 01:00:36
@_date: 2015-01-15 01:51:31
If you are willing to lose it because this is risky and you have faith then do what you do. Don't stress about it.
@_date: 2015-01-27 04:18:27
Sounds scammy :/
I guess they don't touch small amounts but when something big rolls through they snatch it and hope that you give up on it.
I would keep not of all conversations held and all proof that they have your money.
@_date: 2015-01-26 17:28:28
aw thanks! :)
@_date: 2015-01-15 04:38:39
Oh okay I see. 
@_date: 2015-01-10 20:21:23

@_date: 2015-01-13 05:04:56
@_date: 2015-01-21 16:29:47
Learn about it and buy what you can afford to lose
@_date: 2015-01-26 18:36:54
Handful? Nah
@_date: 2015-01-15 21:41:54
Tuition is a bit much these days and it's not like they are going to stop paying for electricity.
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:40:52
You don't sell for whatever you want in the future, you sell for what they are worth.
It's fairly easy to buy them.
@_date: 2015-01-16 00:09:18
Which explains the slow transactions :/
I'm for Bitcoin but come on 
@_date: 2015-01-17 00:05:05
Congratulations! 
@_date: 2015-01-18 02:46:34
And crashing fast 
*ba dum tss*
@_date: 2015-01-15 02:09:55
A car could help you get a job and more money to save and spend how you want and it's promised to you. This is risky. I know you know but think about it again.
What year are you?
@_date: 2015-01-11 21:46:24
You'd need to give a lot more information to get people to support you because as you know, people lie on the Internet.
@_date: 2015-01-28 03:22:53
I wish I had one lol I have 11 dollars in my changetip that I tip on reddit and 12 litecoin
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:44:49
You need to learn about Bitcoin and decide yourself what you think. If you are going to invest you should be bright enough to do it on your own merit, not others and even then it's all up in the air.
It's crashed and gone up before but who knows. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 07:23:10
Does electrum add new addresses to your wallet when you want?
@_date: 2015-01-31 20:54:07
No it's fake.
@_date: 2015-01-15 18:17:25
Agreed! That would be great.
@_date: 2015-01-16 04:44:36
I wonder how profitable Bitcoin would be is there were no holders, just people who used it as currency.
@_date: 2015-01-20 08:23:40
50 bits 
@_date: 2015-01-12 23:59:06
I guess so.
If you have a problem commenting isn't really going help. Downvote and move on I guess.
@_date: 2015-01-25 21:01:34
If you want to support a currency, use it as a currency.
@_date: 2015-01-10 20:06:18
Satoshi Nakamoto was an older man on the outside, in fact he had been an old looking man for a while now but in reality, he was a young handsome buisness man from the year 2100.
He was bright for his age, he had a strong heart and he wanted to make a change in the world for the better. However that proved to be the hardest thing to do because of the monopoly.
Every strong business had been taken over when currency changed. Stardoge, Doge-Mart, K-Doge, JCdogies, Microdoge, the list goes on and on.
Satoshi was sick of the lack of diversity and growth in the world. 
He wanted to change so he worked for his father a business man who accepted the monopoly and used it to thrive.
However because young Nakamoto refused to do questionable things he failed him so much that he was banished from his family. 
He had tried to defeat the all mighty dogecoin with his own crypto currency but it was by far too late. 
He didn't care about money like his father did, he just cared about his family and being banished also meant he could never see his family again.
So there was only one thing he could do.
Time travel.
But first he had to alter his appearance.
"Father, please I can fix this I just need some money."
His father smacked him across the face.
"You are no son of mine. My son is supposed to be good buisness man and take out this stupid doggy coin. "
He pulled out his wallet and gave him his black doge card QR.
"I will revoke your access to my money later today. I do not want to see you until you have fixed this."
Satoshi nodded thankfully and ran out to Changerino's.
"Mr.Shift, I know you refuse to do anything extreme but I must go  into the past and I can not look at myself."
Mr.Shift looked him up and down.
"You don't look like you've got military clearance. I'm not getting in trouble with the law for some random."
I showed him my black doge.
"I will give you anything. I just need to get into the past. I must defeat the doge and make rise a better crypto currency, we need diversity."
He laughed.
"You've already got money why should I help with your greed?"
Satoshi frowned.
"My father banished me. I need to fix this. I promise you when I come back I will live like the common people. I'll even pay you every month so long as I live."
Mr.Shift cleared it over in his mind.
"Alright get into the booth. A change this drastic is going to be extremely painful."
Screams of agony went on for what seemed like forever and then an old man stepped out of the booth.
Satoshi was furious.
"Old! Why old?! How am I supposed to get into the military looking like this?"
Mr.Shift tossed him a mirror.
Satoshi grabbed it and smiled when  he saw his face, he looked just like the head dogedefense man, basically he was a militant who worked for doge who practically monopolized the world.
"Thank you Mr.Shift you won't forget it."
Satoshi hunted down the real general and took him to a place he wouldn't be found an abandoned Wells Fargo and tied him up tight.
"Why are you doing this?! They'll kill you!"
Satoshi looked his clone in the eyes.
"For honor. And to bring down doges monopoly on the world."
The Defense man was silent for a few seconds.
"You do what you need to do but you owe me big time. At least bring in a food bot."
Satoshi dialed in his bot and hoped his father wouldn't shut it down while he was away.
Satoshi left for the military base in the defense mans clothes which had corgis embroidered on the collar.
"This ends now."
He walked onto the base after being scanned and nervously looked around.
A young man walked into Satoshi.
"I am so sorry sir."
Satoshi didn't waste time.
"Escort me to the time travel area, I have a plan for you."
The young man looked ecstatic and led him there.
"Thank you young man, when I come back I'll have something for you."
Satoshi dialed the machine to the year 2000. It spat out thousands and thousands of that times currency.
He wanted to live in the time and learn about it for a few years before starting up.
He praised Mr.Shift in his mine as he walked in and landed into sidewalk next to a McDonalds.
A classic McDonald's not a Mcdogelds.
He went in and ordered food.
This is the beginning of a new era.
@_date: 2015-01-10 21:37:36
I wish I understood the stuff I started two days ago...
I'm just going to buy some lite coin and hope for the best.
@_date: 2015-01-29 10:17:53
[This is a nice gambling site.](
It accepts Bit, Doge, Litecoin, Gimpcoin, and Darkgold.
Let me know if you check it out :)
@_date: 2015-01-13 08:49:25
@_date: 2015-01-25 07:21:30
Using currency makes currency useful, otherwise what's the point besides making a profit by investing? 
@_date: 2015-01-15 19:43:05
Spamming them emails doesn't sound like the way to go about it.
They know about Bitcoin. They either are getting around to it or not but I think they are going to push reddit notes so it might be a lost cause.
@_date: 2015-01-12 05:36:57
You have a whole coin from that game?
@_date: 2015-01-26 06:20:34
I have expensive text books that's what I have lol fucking college 
@_date: 2015-01-12 05:45:48
A lot of people already know about this app but it's okay :) some people may not.
1 Bitcoin is worth like 169 right now.
You probably got some bits.
@_date: 2015-01-26 08:18:45
It's a book written by my teacher unfortunately.
@_date: 2015-01-10 21:06:08
You're awesome.
You should go through and upvote everyone to counteract the downvotes.
@_date: 2015-01-11 19:22:41
Oh okay thanks a ton!
@_date: 2015-01-15 05:05:49
Now is a bad time to sell, the prices are way down but if you don't care go for it!
@_date: 2015-01-25 22:24:31
Well I think giving it a start in coin related subreddits would be good instead of starting it up right away in random ones.
Also it would be good if the bot could receive tips so the pot is always full from donations.
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:43:28
You must be very fortunate. I could only buy 9 litecoin. If I could afford the Bitcoin I would so go for it. I have faith, just no cash to back it.
Good luck! 
@_date: 2015-01-31 20:54:41
@_date: 2015-01-26 07:59:59
1 coin would be a huge deal to me let alone 5. I really hope someone can help you. What I was going to suggest has already been suggested :/
If it doesn't work out and you need someone to talk to, shoot me a message. Some people get a bit drastic when crumby things happen and don't have anyone to vent to.
@_date: 2015-01-26 08:52:17
Ah I see. -pats back-
@_date: 2015-01-13 08:49:15
Almost lol
@_date: 2015-01-25 06:45:04
It's different for something you would want to be currency. If you want the currency to be successful, use it as currency.
It's so freaking volitale now it may as well be used correctly.
@_date: 2015-01-26 09:06:09
I hope to sell my books at the end of the semester to do so lol hopefully the price is still low

Would be great to see someone explain why or why not

It says randomly selected.
I think they meant the post hast to hit 30 not a comment.

Back it up just in case but yes you can retrieve it from another machine with your info.

Litecoin is super cheap so I figure I ought to go for it.
@_date: 2015-01-10 21:55:40
I am going to get some litecoin since it's super cheap. Thank you.
@_date: 2015-01-21 17:48:18
Oh okay, well go for it.
@_date: 2015-01-28 21:07:00
Right! I wish the same.
@_date: 2015-01-25 22:16:15
I think this is a great idea.
You should start in the tip related subreddits.
The name of the bot should be something like: RandomCoinTipBot
That way it's not just one coin. I have never seen anyone tip bit in a doge sub or vice versa so the name should be clear.
@_date: 2015-01-25 06:56:04
I know but I'm speaking of relatively young Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-25 07:20:30
I can only think of ways to drive it up.
To drive it down would probably require getting tons of people to sell.
Ways this could be achieved?
Make everyone think the price is going to drop drastically.
How one could do that? Useless Bitcoin propaganda and rumors to the degree of 4chan precision.
Where's my ten bucks? Lol
@_date: 2015-01-15 02:03:09
I'm in college and broke but I would in the very least buy 2.
@_date: 2015-01-11 04:10:56
This was good. Do you write in your spare time?
@_date: 2015-01-26 05:22:56
That's hard to do when the price keeps going up
@_date: 2015-01-25 06:22:16
If you buy products with Bitcoin and the person who gave you the product also buys things with Bitcoin it makes it more valuable.
Holding a dormant amount of Bitcoin does nothing helpful unless you are just buying, buying, buying, and hoarding.
@_date: 2015-01-13 02:57:47
Not if you bought at 1000 or anything more than 250.
@_date: 2015-01-26 18:12:20
It may how down a bit after this announcement has driven it up but it's pretty low in regards to how it used to be 1000 per coin.
You can buy now or keep watch and see if it keeps going down or if it goes up a little.
Remember me when you buy lmao
However you should learn more!
@_date: 2015-01-13 02:10:50
Well what price did you buy at?
@_date: 2015-01-28 03:42:04

I don't think it's crazy, people have bought a lot more than two at a time.

@_date: 2015-01-14 20:22:31
Let me know how it goes!
@_date: 2015-01-12 02:08:08
So all the coin will be in one place even if I use different addresses.
@_date: 2015-01-15 01:38:05
So.. What inspired that user name lol
@_date: 2015-01-12 03:27:06
I don't think it would gain any traction with new people unless a sob story was attached or something else "news worthy".
I have tried explaining bitcoins to friends and they don't even try to understand.
I was explaining that one disorder/disease to one of my friends before the ice bucket challenge was well known, next thing you know I was getting schooled by her.
@_date: 2015-01-12 03:03:51
I would probably send things to one of the addresses and transfer from that address to another.
@_date: 2015-01-10 22:38:58
I just traded a little Bitcoin for one litecoin
@_date: 2015-01-28 09:25:30
You withdraw them carefully and deposit them into my wallet so I can make sure they are safe. I'll give them back right away :) lol
@_date: 2015-01-13 08:35:50
So, could I have one of your coins... for science? Hahah
In all seriousness I wish everyone had the confidence. Well more so I wish everyone was less worried.
@_date: 2015-01-26 22:43:53
If you are confident in it then go for it but once it goes up bail lol jk but if it what you want go for it just give me a coin or two haha
@_date: 2015-01-10 20:48:55

I'll hold them for you just send them to me :)
In all seriousness I think electrum is fine.

This will go to me tipping others. I don't have enough bits to be holding or buying anything really lol 
@_date: 2015-01-11 03:41:30
I just had a little fun with it. 
@_date: 2015-01-24 04:25:03
Okay this is pretty awesome!
@_date: 2015-01-13 00:29:26
Depends on how much trouble you are willing to get in if you're are caught honestly. Haha I sure couple use some coins 
Is it worth it morally to you?
@_date: 2015-01-26 08:17:48
A lot of people do that, some hold, and some actually use it as a currency.
We get all aspects here and some news about Bitcoin and a lot of guesses about the future.
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:12:21
It said I could buy any amount of Bitcoin so I'd probably just buy a dollars worth and pocket the twenty.
@_date: 2015-01-14 06:39:28
Don't listen to this guy about forgetting the password.
@_date: 2015-01-12 05:53:28
Everyone is talking mess about people buying litecoin these days but they'll be saying that too.
@_date: 2015-01-15 22:30:39
A lot of people are into Bitcoin for the money, not to actually replace fiat. Kind of backwards isn't it.
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:51:17
I'll take em! Haha
But In all seriousness try holding.

Any idea what you're gonna spend it on first?
@_date: 2015-01-30 22:36:15
They probably exchange some of it for fiat and keep some USD.
There isn't anything wrong with that.

I never received my Bitcoin from when the site first started, guess it's a good time to login and see if it lets me. It was such a hassle when it started but if you're doing this I'll assume everything works now.

I think to get them interested he should mention how much Bitcoin was worth when it started and then when it hit 1K
@_date: 2015-04-25 04:54:03
@_date: 2015-04-07 16:20:12
I don't know why anyone would compare Bitcoin to Internet.
Internet was completely new, didn't really have a competition to deal with while Bitcoin is a new type of currency.

Satoshi make me feel rich. :D
@_date: 2015-04-07 06:04:21
You aren't understanding what I'm saying and the fact that you don't know what a chargeback is, is more of a deterrent.

Good :)
@_date: 2015-04-27 02:37:35
There is no underlying meaning behind my statement, you're trying to read between the lines but there is nothing.
My point is exactly what I said, if new people can not partake it is useless. So mentioning those who have been holding for three years is a moot point, it does not attest to the successfulness of the coin.
@_date: 2015-04-02 04:17:34
Give me a coin if you aren't April fooling.
I will give it back!

It's always safer when you have control. Just write down your seed.
Think of coinbase as a bank to get coin from and sell coin at, you take BTC from them and put it in your wallet.
@_date: 2015-04-01 23:36:38
If 25 percent are using it then I'd assume there would be more miners so I think we would be good as long as they profit.

The whole notion of increasing your likely hood to win by donation more seems kind of lame but I think the idea as a whole is a good one.

If you have been scammed (find out) just do a chargeback.
@_date: 2015-03-09 23:41:24
I would rather pay with PayPal when it comes to something like eBay because if I get screwed over I can do a chargeback.
20 percent off is not enough incentive for me personally when it comes to that risk.

Stop having it manually put in to a 401K and take that money and invest it into Bitcoin yourself?
@_date: 2015-03-26 23:55:56
You should write how much in USD it's worth and explain how it can be exchanged for USD.
And then explain you can tip over social media accounts instantly via changetip

He loves fiat, that's what I know.
@_date: 2015-03-12 01:31:37
Honestly I would exchange some for fiat because the things I buy on a regular basis do not accept PayPal and I'm not going to go through a bind just to be able to spend my coin especially when it's so volitale

Congratulations! :)
Awesome that you're going to keep up with your modly duties. I hope to see changetip grow! I believe one day it'll replace PayPal. :)
3000 bits
@_date: 2015-03-02 20:20:34
You would send them Bitcoin and they would accept it and exchange or sell for fiat.

@_date: 2015-03-13 19:58:41
I hope to see you guys prosper.
@_date: 2015-03-31 03:10:52
Ah, well I'm glad they helped you because I was going to tip you :)
@_date: 2015-03-26 16:06:03
A Benny!
@_date: 2015-03-15 20:18:28
I think a light green or blue would be nice because the color orange you have now looks like a caution/detour run away from site type of vibe while green means money and blue is calming.
@_date: 2015-03-22 06:45:14
Howdy 
@_date: 2015-03-21 20:04:51
Yeah, I always hear this too.
I'm like you should want to help out even if your profits are minimal, as long as you aren't losing money doing it why not? 
If it's your only source of income I could see why you'd want to pick people off but come on, get a job! Lol
@_date: 2015-03-27 05:51:48
If you changetip then yah
@_date: 2015-03-05 03:59:39
No, I was just noticing the number and it made me cringe lol 
@_date: 2015-03-07 21:20:44
Dude you are fanfreakingtastic!
@_date: 2015-03-15 16:52:50
Sounds like you may have a problem
@_date: 2015-03-22 04:10:24
It's going pretty good :) just working on a logo :)
@_date: 2015-03-25 23:51:16
If fiat was ever introduced.
@_date: 2015-03-15 16:49:39
Think positively, you only really lost 5 bucks.
Once I reach ten, I withdraw the five and play with my new five only that way it's like I never lost.
@_date: 2015-03-09 19:45:09
Do you not know your seed/password?
@_date: 2015-03-11 22:55:09
Things are going pretty okay :)
I love using my moniker and I saw you so I thought what the hey
@_date: 2015-02-11 03:58:24
@_date: 2015-03-22 04:43:11
Well it's a knight logo for someone :)
I do logos to make some cash.
@_date: 2015-03-01 03:09:25
People leave their coin in the exchange.
@_date: 2015-03-31 16:46:30
You know that's true :)
It's so much fun especially in subreddits that aren't cryptocurrency related (when it's welcomed). 
@_date: 2015-02-03 16:15:26
Oh wow! Is there really no downside?
I'm signing up for the 14 dollar a month plan on trade wave asap. 
They also won't let you withdraw and will take it back but let you keep any profits.
@_date: 2015-02-19 06:07:34
I could use the cash then again anyone could. I could draw you or write you something for it. I doubt gender matters but I am a girl, though I definitely will not be sending nudes haha 
@_date: 2015-03-01 22:52:50
I know but hey they asked tell
Them that lol
@_date: 2015-03-31 17:30:46
@_date: 2015-03-03 18:36:03
The best you can do BEFOREHAND exchanging is asking for a picture of their ID, and maybe a signature and ask them to email you it by the email they use for PayPal.
Even then you probably won't win.
@_date: 2015-03-05 03:21:49
I gave you 3,666 bits 0-0 evilllllllllll
Lmao I didn't notice till now
@_date: 2015-03-03 04:39:47
Instead of using money I ask my friends to pay me back in BTC now.
First no one borrowed from me since then but a friend really needed the cash so he agreed.
And now he's into it :D
@_date: 2015-03-03 03:07:31
I would use an exchange?
@_date: 2015-03-19 01:24:48
No you put the amount you want to tip like 1 Bitcoin for example then you summon the changetip 
@_date: 2015-02-06 23:23:09
Lol that's true 
@_date: 2015-02-03 15:54:10
The consistency is wonderful! :)
@_date: 2015-03-26 18:49:33
Actually yeah you're right about that.
@_date: 2015-02-04 20:30:04
Too bad on mobile I can still see the ninja tips lol
@_date: 2015-03-09 23:52:54
For me personally if I was using something I couldn't chargeback like Bitcoin on a site like eBay I would pay once I had what I bought in my hands.
@_date: 2015-02-03 20:48:05
We don't need more pay to win games.
I feel like that would just tick off the gaming community.
@_date: 2015-02-01 22:31:50
is my new Giveaway subreddit!
I just started it up! Check it out.
I would love some coin for my next giveaway :)
@_date: 2015-02-06 23:21:01
Food themed super heros? [Yes?]( lol
@_date: 2015-03-31 15:57:09
@_date: 2015-02-18 01:43:29
Because the prices change so crazily and selling a product for 20 bucks it needs to stay 20 bucks and not drop once you have already given the product.
@_date: 2015-02-23 01:42:50
Is this for the backed.io contest? 
Or are you hosting one?
Anyone who comments here make sure you do backed.io first.
You can find a link to the contest in my subreddit @_date: 2015-02-03 05:49:05
I participated. :) I'm excited to see Backed take off.
@_date: 2015-02-27 00:28:04
If you have PayPal you can buy from me just shoot me a PM :)
@_date: 2015-02-19 19:02:53
I am :) 
@_date: 2015-02-08 18:20:49
Contact the dev and suggest it
@_date: 2015-02-08 22:24:26
Can I just have it? I could really use it. Lol
@_date: 2015-02-10 18:45:56
Dude you are on fire literally -sprays with water gun-
@_date: 2015-02-18 04:14:11
Not even one, my priorities on college and food surpass my urge to buy Bitcoin so I try to earn it by drawing stuff for people and what not. :)
@_date: 2015-03-05 04:06:32
Yeah lol I would never ask for bits back that I've given especially when I said I wanted you to have them
@_date: 2015-03-26 18:45:22
If they are disabling your 2FA I do t think that it's completely unreasonable that they confirm who you are with complete certainty.
@_date: 2015-03-15 20:33:06
Badass! I haven't seen you in a while, how's it going? :)
@_date: 2015-02-03 17:38:42
@_date: 2015-02-27 02:12:43
Isn't their a bazaar for Bitcoin?
I see a lot of people selling coin on eBay.
@_date: 2015-02-19 22:13:37
@_date: 2015-02-13 22:56:43
Litecoin is pretty okay actually
@_date: 2015-02-04 20:31:07
Are good places to earn bits!
@_date: 2015-02-06 22:14:54
You should have never invested something you couldn't afford to lose.
@_date: 2015-02-01 22:34:08
Thanks a million! :)
+50 doge :)
@_date: 2015-02-18 01:58:19
Really? How not?
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:08:13
is a great place to set up tasks that reward people or to earn coin doing tasks or participating in giveaways and contests! Check it out :)
@_date: 2015-02-08 06:13:38
You gave 400 bits to one person who takes advantage of your kindness here's it back 400 bits
@_date: 2015-02-28 21:57:35
People don't want to sell Bitcoin for PayPal because of charge backs 
@_date: 2015-02-03 04:49:50
That sounds like a great idea! 
@_date: 2015-02-24 16:31:21
How do you not have either?
It's almost like you want us to get coins from a wallet that isn't yours.
@_date: 2015-02-06 23:51:29
@_date: 2015-02-18 02:30:16
2 percent is not a big deal when barely anyone uses Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-19 06:38:27
Good job on picking the guy with the dog :)
@_date: 2015-02-28 20:20:55
Changetip said Charles did it on his own so don't blame them for his actions.
Which weren't even that bad he was generous and tried to make changetip and Bitcoin more popular.
@_date: 2015-02-09 18:29:55
1000 bitcoins 
@_date: 2015-02-18 02:50:15
I mean explaining Bitcoin to customers on a larger scale 
@_date: 2015-02-03 15:18:32
Ah I see
@_date: 2015-02-17 04:57:14
Can I get some of that special paint money lol
@_date: 2015-02-22 06:03:45
I think offering incentive like perhaps a contest giving away your most popular product and requiring something that involves looking at your products as a contest so people are driven to look at what you are selling.
Or perhaps having special things or pluses that are Bitcoin exclusive like every time you buy something with Bitcoin you get a raffle ticket that's for a monthly draw for example.
@_date: 2015-02-19 22:06:24
I demand 5 dollars!!!!
Lol in a serious I'll be happy with5 bits :)
@_date: 2015-03-22 04:03:50
@_date: 2015-03-31 01:11:49
How many do you have?
@_date: 2015-02-02 00:27:54
There is no proof of said game so I will not be contributing.
@_date: 2015-02-28 20:38:03
I don't feel betrayed or bothered by it. A bunch of companies do things like this regularly.
If I like something I'll keep using it.
@_date: 2015-02-24 23:46:24
@_date: 2015-02-06 22:15:30
We can't predict the future, it's up in the air.
@_date: 2015-02-01 22:56:10
I would suggest buying a Visa card with that and buying Bitcoin with it.
@_date: 2015-02-09 18:35:01
If I had 1000 bitcoins I would give you one.
You're super active.
@_date: 2015-03-11 22:49:09
15 handyhook 
@_date: 2015-02-27 17:01:21
No one cares who is on the money just that it's money. 
You guys find any reason to put Bitcoin over money these days.
Stick with the ones that matter.
@_date: 2015-02-19 06:10:45
People can't take jokes it's no biggie lol 
The super villain with in will not be awaken by mere downvotes haha
@_date: 2015-02-19 04:11:50
Can this comment be the reason why you give me 1 BTC? Lol
Nice to see the ads bringing people in
@_date: 2015-03-31 16:38:54
Gotta love tipping Tuesday! :)
@_date: 2015-02-28 20:57:47
I'm an individual with my own opinions.
I can't speak for that whole subreddit.
@_date: 2015-02-20 19:18:39
And who are you?
No one.
It's a currency.
It's supposed to be used. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 19:32:16
Game = give me free money 
@_date: 2015-02-27 21:41:57
@_date: 2015-02-06 20:00:40
Let me know! PM me anytime.
I'm glad you like my drawing. 
@_date: 2015-02-06 23:29:01
Hahaha you over estimate my ability. 
Beside I swear he/she knows exactly where the first page posts are before they hit the front page. 
@_date: 2015-02-19 09:19:33
That's fine.
@_date: 2015-02-05 23:10:12
-sobs at what I could've had had I not have been in middle school-
@_date: 2015-02-08 06:27:31
:) anytime 
@_date: 2015-02-03 17:26:04
It's not, they take the 500 back and let you keep the profit but you have to pay14 at least to participate which reasonable 
@_date: 2015-02-13 07:10:04
I'm unable to connect to the website unfortunately, any ideas why? :)
@_date: 2015-02-01 23:04:17
Uhhhh idk I know they sell Giftcards though 
@_date: 2015-02-07 20:43:02
Awesome :)
@_date: 2015-02-07 20:36:14
I participate over there frequently. While cryptocurrency is starting to be more and more accepted, it's not the place for Bitcoin only discussion and what not. 
There any many ways to donate and accept.
@_date: 2015-02-19 22:52:06
I would hold for sure :)
@_date: 2015-02-28 18:53:20
You can't anywhere officially because it's too risky.
@_date: 2015-02-09 16:08:51
The support button would look nicer if it were placed horizontally versus vertically, and the logo would look nicer if the Y wasn't taller than the b. I'm not sure why but the prices don't appear on mobile devices. Mobile devices are very important because people tend to favor websites they can use on mobile and on PC.
I think the top bar should go Home, Account, Deposit, Withdraw, Market Future, Spot. Because the goal is to get as many accounts made yes?
The pictures with information move to fast for them to be read also.
Over all the site looks lovely and professional though!
@_date: 2015-02-18 02:04:14
Okay that's awesome!
But why would they do that when they could just accept the cash upfront?
It's a waste of time really until Bitcoin is mainstream if it ever is
@_date: 2015-02-06 19:58:58
[Drawing gives me peace.](
:) 
@_date: 2015-02-09 18:31:30
Oh god such a typo lmfao 
1000 bits
Every time I give you bits you give them back but I'll never stop trying!
@_date: 2015-02-24 16:51:39
Wow 
@_date: 2015-02-07 17:23:49
