Maybe some of these resources have been successful in part due to their quality and in part due to some first-mover advantage. However as far as bitcoin.org is involved, funding happened only at a very later time, when the website looked exactly like it looks today.
The sponsorship helped us spend more time only in the recent years, and massively helped with translations. But the major expense is the server so the binaries can be served over HTTPS without risky ads on sourceforge.
In other words, while very helpful, funding cannot be accounted for what made bitcoin.org a useful and popular resource in my views. It has been the dedication of volunteers and it being the home for Bitcoin Core.

It's worth to note that, to my knowledge, one can get the benefits of running a full node (full validation) without contributing back to the network (relaying blocks and transactions, serving SPV client requests), in order to slow down bandwidth consumption. This is pretty similar to leeching without seeding in the bittorrent world.

Wallets can be submitted for review by anybody, ideally by their own employees / developers so they can answer any questions that may arise while reviewing the wallet. Wallets are added/updated all the time. The Foundation isn't involved with updating the website, they're providing financial support.
@_date: 2014-07-17 11:13:16
I wasn't sure about this too. Currently, if a user has javascript disabled, they are seeing all wallets. Otherwise the mobile category is auto-selected when the page loads.

All I see is this would decrease variance on P2Pool, making it a little more attractive, while creating the illusion that mining is decentralized.
@_date: 2014-11-06 16:56:11
Actually if you're not running a full node for mining, you're part of the problem (although mining on smaller mining pools is still better than mining on larger ones).
@_date: 2014-10-12 21:30:05
The trust is in nodes, developers, miners and the economic majority. All of these have strong influence over Bitcoin.
Miners just don't want to run the risk that a node will not relay their block and are therefore likely to accept whatever is protecting their short-term investment. Not all miners have a long-term view.
Bitcoin users however (and nodes, in particular) don't want the system to break and the reason is obvious; they are the end users. The great thing is that nodes are controled by these people.
When it comes to developers, they for sure have a lot of influence. But the system being open-source, users have the final word on what is adopted and any developer, known or not, can publicly point to any issue in the code and/or submit patches and/or fork the code.
@_date: 2014-07-17 16:25:08
Maybe I need some education here, to my knowledge full nodes are exposing their own IP addresses, but not the source IP address of the transactions they are relaying, can someone proove me wrong?

Google Analytics was used only for a few days in January 2014 before moving to a dedicated server, at the time there was a 34,80 % bounce rate. Otherwise current stats respect users privacy and use no third party, so they provide quite limited information.

BC.i was supposed to have entered in a 5 years deal IIRC, I was surprised by this too.
Unfortunately due to the cost of "renting" this domain, I guess it's not likely that any business using the domain won't do some marketing. Hopefully OKCoin will be less biased than BC.i though.

Re-tested, Hive Web does support HSTS.
Hive Web offers an interesting security model, they do not store your wallet online, they store the encryption key and wipe it if you fail to provide the right pin after 5 attempts, although the pin is very weak, bruteforce attacks are also strongly restricted.
I haven't seen any indication thus far that users have lost funds or that the wallet suffered any security problem - again, that I know.
@_date: 2014-07-17 10:57:16
Thanks for your feedback,
However SPV is still a very good zero trust option. There's quite a big difference between centralized services and SPV / using random Electrum servers, so these don't deserve to have the same lower score. And although full nodes are the of "ideal security" and get an excellent score in bold, this security currently comes with a cost, so having only full nodes in green seems like a disservice to users to me.
I've also tried to avoid too technical terms as much as possible in titles, the majority of the visitors on bitcoin.org are not likely to know what "SPV" means IMO. Although I'm not closed mind on this if other people like the idea.
@_date: 2014-12-07 00:40:03
That survey is very enlightening, thanks!
I wonder what would be the result if participants had been asked how many bitcoins they lost, no only *if* they lost bitcoins (in other words did people make small or huge mistakes on their own).

I haven't found any serious indication thus far that Coinbase had a large number of concerning security issues in the recent years. The only case I can remember is issues with developer API enabled by default, and users were reimbursed - again, that I know
Services like Coinbase also can allow for weaker passwords than blockchain.info since they can easily restrict login attempts and bruteforce attacks.
Thus far no service on bitcoin.org is asked to provide 2FA authentication by default, but services who do (e.g greenaddress) get an improved score.
Coinbase gets a very low score for their security model that highly relies on trust.

Yes they're cool, I wished to update resource links for quite some time now, so may be a good addition!
But it's different than what I had in mind, I'd like to easily let people buy a small amount of bitcoins and do a real transaction with their wallet. The real stuff...
@_date: 2014-12-26 18:57:59
This isn't accurate, BC.i is partially open-source, their server code is closed source, which is not uncommon (e.g. Mycelium, maybe Hive Web), so it's no better or worse than many other companies.
However, if by "other companies" you speak only of custodial wallets like Coinbase, Circle and the like, it is true that BC.i provides more transparency into the code.

gmaxwell also made many interesting suggestions about privacy, I kind of knew this one would be much harder to keep simple and intentionally started with what seemed like the highest priority (address reuse). But I'll review all of this feedback and see what can be done.

Well the more you prefer usability, the more you're going with an "all-in-one" web wallet and exchange, working on all your devices. Convenience is hard to mix with zero-trust and secure models. But in either case, all of these options are presented, not just "90s looking desktop client".

Both solutions have drawbacks and need development. But merge avoidance could perhaps do what CoinJoin might fail to achieve (I dunno), AFAIK it's no less efficient than CoinJoin at protecting people's privacy (and might actually be better in some cases). CoinJoin really depends on steady massive adoption to actually work to a secure level. So I'm worried it *could* end up creating a collective illusion of privacy, actually helping massive surveillance. But who knows at this stage, it's all untested ground, which is why I appreciate your efforts.

Suspending BC.i from bitcoin.org is no fun, but a lot of people way more knowledgeable than me have been speaking about these issues for long. Given that bitcoin.org is perceived like a stamp of approval, not opening the pull request wouldn't have been responsible.
For sure, if other regular contributors disagreed and I ignored them all, I wouldn't have been able to merge that pull request, my commits would probably have been reverted.

As far as I'm concerned, I haven't found any reasons to not list Circle at this point (although I didn't make a complete review of their service yet).
But as for "why is X here if X isn't here", it's only because someone took care of submitting X and not X. Circle is quite new compared to Coinbase so this isn't surprising, I thought of submitting it myself quite a few times but lacked time.

I think you don't realize the systemic risks involved with 80% of all users using a single custodial web wallet, or users abandonning full nodes. Bitcoin.org certainly makes usability tradeoffs to promote diversity, but significant efforts are made to reward and support the efforts of each actor in the ecosystem.

I can repeat it another time, the domain was registered by Satoshi, and transfered to Sirius, who was a core developer at the time. It's now co-owned by sirius, theymos and cobra. The GitHub repository is owned by the Bitcoin Core team who has all push access, but I am the maintainer (as in I take part in all discussions and try to find the best consensus between active contributors before merging changes). The Foundation provides a 2000$/month sponsorship that I use to pay server expenses, translations, developer documentation, and other expenses, but most work is volunteer work.

Hosting eats 580$/month right away. In general pages are designed to not require constant updating, in part because this is wasted time, and also because updating translations has an important cost when you support 25 languages and do careful review.

I just noticed this thread, all fixed - 
But to be fair, this description wasn't new. It was on Google for as far as I remember (and was probably accurate when bitcoin.org was the only website about Bitcoin).

I know, that's one reason why I say multiple sources of funding is important, in which case more money from one source carries limited risk of influencing development.
@_date: 2014-12-05 17:43:49
FWIW, I don't know how feasible or controversial this would be, but it's been a moment that I wish we could somehow let the user get a very small amount of bitcoins right away from the landing page in order to let them at least try Bitcoin with limited risk before going through the usual disclaimers and other details.
The main questions being, how do you make this process really simple in practice without unfairly promoting any specific wallet, and reasonably accessible without very high rates of fraud (credit cards being the most accessible payment methods for buying things online).
I'm also thinking the "How it works" page could be redesigned completely with more educative and engaging illustrations - but the people I've approached with this idea lacked time to involve to any reasonable degree.

I suggested howtobuybitcoins.info to find a way to do a better promotion of one-click deposit exchanges such as Circle and Coinbase:
I am also thinking of having our own "Get bitcoins" page instead of only linking to howtobuybitcoins.info, this way we could provide more visibility to what's likely to most accessible methods for buying bitcoins as well as linking to more options than just exchanges (ATM maps, OTC)
@_date: 2014-07-17 16:58:48
There might be good reasons for this. Satoshi always wanted his "assets" to be decentralized as possible. Even I worked very long as the maintainer for bitcoin.org's "content" and I don't know much about who's in control of the domain, and to a certain extent, this *might* be a good thing (although I hope I won't be proven wrong).
@_date: 2014-12-31 19:25:25
I am no expert regarding exchanges, but unless I'm mistaken, taking Bitstamp as an example, you'd have to go through a lot more steps, fees and delays to deposit money. You can't just go to your Bitstamp account, type how many you want to deposit from your bank account or credit card and click "Deposit". Circle and Coinbase are providing enhanced bank and credit cards integration which simplifies the buying process, according to what I've heard.

A web wallet with mandatory 2FA would be more secure against malware, but less secure against compromised javascript on the website, there is no perfect choice.
@_date: 2014-12-05 17:00:46
Feedback to improve this page is welcome!
But, really it's just 4 short texts/steps, each linking to a directory that gives plenty of choice.
I think the merchants directory should be changed, but there is unfortunately not a single "do-all" large-scale directory for online/physical businesses that I know...
I've encouraged the developer of the exchange directory to give more visibility to simple one-click deposit options such as Coinbase and Circle, but that's pretty much their choice.
@_date: 2014-07-17 16:56:24
I've been very unsure about GreenAddress.. But I've finally choosed to go with "2FA must be mandatory to get a good score".
According to my testing, most web wallets support the feature, but the feature is usually optional and often not very visible if not hidden. So it's safe to assume a lot of people won't enable 2FA with most services.
GreenAddress on the other hands is putting a lot of energy on promoting the feature during the account creation, and later reminds it pretty strongly.
But where is the line if we allow optional 2FA? I guess nobody will really agree about "which service promotes 2FA enough or not enough to get a good score" and it will be very easy to circumvent the requirement.
@_date: 2014-07-17 11:10:40
As far as I can tell, the vast majority of bitcoins lost so far are due to third parties ~~like~~ using a similar model than Coinbase and these services pilling tons of bitcoins in a single location are also systematic risks for the ecosystem. So just by taking lessons from recent history, we can conclude these services are still risky and very few mistakes can lead to very sad consequences.
In addition, your bitcoins aren't any safer because they are stored by a third party if this third party doesn't require strong authentication (e.g. mandatory two-factor authentication). Otherwise, anything a hacker needs to steal your bitcoins is your password.
If you take a closer look to the new page, a lot of effort has been spent on giving a better score to web wallets which are reducing this counterparty risk (hybrid / multisig) or asking for strong authentication (two-factor authentication). Coinbase unfortunately makes it very optional to use two-factor authentication and even lets people choose pretty weak passwords compared to other web wallets.
@_date: 2014-12-06 16:13:50
Quite limited public stats can be found here:
Note: A magnitude more users implies significant systemic risk if a good part if these users all use the same web wallet, like you're suggesting.
Google Analytics from the short time it was enabled in January doesn't seem to let me know how much users were dispatched to external websites from the wallet page. This would be interesting data indeed, although at the time the page had a completely different layout.
@_date: 2014-07-17 16:45:52
Haha, thanks! :)
@_date: 2014-06-10 18:29:58
To be fair, both merge avoidance and CoinJoin are making blacklists harder compared to what we have *today*. But I see your point, these approachs aren't competing anyway (at least AFAIK) and it's good to not put all our eggs in the same basket.

If you had not spent all outputs sent to an address, you would still lose the remaining bitcoins, and any attacker could try to double-spend the transaction until it is included in a block.

@_date: 2014-12-07 00:32:37
To be honest I don't think any particular wallet has a bulletproof security model that should be recommended to all, they all have different risks. One concern I'd like to investigate with these services is how easy it would be to get access to the wallet only by having unauthorized access to an email account. I think Coinbase doesn't ask for 2FA by default, so I wonder what additional authentication they can ask for if the user clicks "I have lost my password".
@_date: 2014-12-06 20:26:36
No *published* standard would be more accurate, I'm working on it:
Although, you don't know this, but BC.i got free visibility on bitcoin.org for more than a year only thanks to me actually. And likely will continue to get visibility from there in the future.

No, 51% is meaningless here (AFAIK). You can't enforce arbitrary rules on other peers, thus a fork involving only 20% of all nodes will exist for as long as these nodes do not use the same code as other nodes. There is only psychological pressure to adopt a consensus because running the risk of depending on a chain that will likely be abandonned isn't without consequences.

Any wallet that has a flawed RNG (random number generator) risks having this problem and there seems to be transactions affected once in awhile 
The Android SecureRandom bug also caused duplicate R values in ECDSA signatures for many wallets previously: 
Not reusing addresses reduces the window of attack and deterministic ECDSA nonces (RFC 6979) get around the underlying issue by not using random nonces for signing, preventing the same nonces to be reused.
What is concerning to me is BC.i suffered from the same issue in the past: 
AFAIK they always reimbursed their customers, which is good, but they could however easily not be able to do so if this flaw affected any wealthy Bitcoin address.
Edit: Here's a post explaining the math:

Actually bitcoin.org says:
"In order to protect the network, you should join smaller mining pools and prefer decentralized pools like P2Pool or pools with getblocktemplate (GBT) support."
"There are various ways to make money with Bitcoin such as mining, speculation or running new businesses. All of these methods are competitive and there is no guarantee of profit. It is up to each individual to make a proper evaluation of the costs and the risks involved in any such project."
@_date: 2014-03-14 21:48:35
Actually, that's exactly how bitcoin.org works too:
The Developer Guide is open-source:
@_date: 2014-12-06 21:41:30
Some issues when put together create larger issues, just take the lack of HD wallet, lack of address rotation, lack of deterministic nonces when signing, you end up exposing public keys and signatures to javascript cryptography, hoping that it won't use the same nonce twice otherwise private key is publicly compromised.
This is a good example why supporting both BIP32 and RFC6979 will be a huge step forward for BC.i when they'll implement these improvements.

The foundation's members were not completely disinterested by lobbying either according to the recent survey, even if a majority was more interested by core development, so it seems to me there would be no harm in keeping some involvement in both spaces while focusing more on core development for the following year. I don't know why it should be a binary choice :/
@_date: 2014-12-07 06:16:47
2FA warning on high balances is an interesting approach.

The domain is co-owned by sirius, theymos and cobra.
The server is owned by me, co-managed, paid thanks to the Foundation.
The git repository is owned by core developers.
@_date: 2014-11-20 08:10:57
I don't see the harm of funding development. What's needed to avoid one organization control development is multiple sources of funding, not less.
So in my views, this means that having the Foundation as a stable source of funding, as opposed to nothing, is a first step in the right direction.
For what it's worth, the Foundation didn't exert influence over bitcoin.org while funding the website.
@_date: 2014-07-17 20:38:30
Yep, agreed this sounds like a good plan too. I just pushed the change.
@_date: 2014-06-10 05:00:39
I really wish [merge avoidance]( gets more attention in the future.

Thanks for leading the effort! Please contact me o gwb3 on Transifex if you need anything (e.g. if the coordinator is inactive, if you need a live preview once translations are nearly finished, if you're unsure about anything).

I agree it's often barely possible to do something with good faith without dealing with a lot of drama and accusations in that space, and I too wouldn't be surprised if Circle wanted to stay away from it, although I have no idea if any such strategy would stand out to be really good in the long run.
FWIW, I wish this community would more kindly reward and encourage any good move regarding security and challenge developers in a way that would make them clearly win good PR for listening. If it's unclear if you stand out to lose more by engaging with the community than by ignoring it, this community clearly have missed something.
@_date: 2015-01-25 02:15:23
At a first glance, and only to my impression, it seems like there is an increasing distance that is building up between Circle and some part of the ecosystem. I may be wrong but I think communication should be encouraged at all means.

Regulators will force you to do something. bitcoin.org only gives or doesn't give free visibility. This is completely different in my views.
This being said, developers are consulted so they can comment if they have any issue with any requirement, and help provide solutions. The requirements and scores have been regularly updated to take into account different security models as well.
@_date: 2015-01-25 13:25:17
To be fair, they said they have enabled HSTS on their next updates and did sound like they cared about security, although they seemed hard to reach at first. From my perspective, I think it is a bit premature to draw too much conclusions, there is also the possibility of simple communication issues.
@_date: 2014-08-01 16:14:39
I deal with the Foundation and they're of a great financial help, but if the Foundation wants anything related to bitcoin.org, they have to go through the same process as any contributor (pull requests on GitHub). I've noticed a lot of people seem to be assuming the Foundation is given some decision making power due to the banner, I would strongly oppose to that (not just the Foundation but any sponsor).
@_date: 2015-01-25 12:04:35
Indeed, although such spontaneous spikes in traffic aren't very common (less than once a month).
@_date: 2015-01-25 02:02:46
There is no indication whatsoever that Circle are being riskier now than before. Since they don't enable HSTS (yet), you only need to make sure you access the HTTPS ( website.
@_date: 2015-01-10 15:03:10
Nice! I love tempeh too :)
@_date: 2015-01-25 03:03:35
HSTS isn't a silver bullet. It is however a non-obtrusive and simple policy that protects against many MITM attacks. HSTS was proposed as a potential requirement to all wallets not already supporting it, and they welcomed the change. Only then it was submitted as a requirement.
Generally speaking, requirements are based on good security practices developers are already adopting.
@_date: 2015-01-25 18:10:36
Thanks for giving me headaches :)
@_date: 2015-01-25 03:05:38
The wallet list is already rotating, once daily.
@_date: 2015-01-13 16:17:59
That's interesting, there is also still more than 150k monthly page views from Russia: 
@_date: 2015-01-25 03:37:50
Circle have been emailed three times, each of which they could have commented if they thought they had any good reason to not enable HSTS which would have been interesting to think about.  Do you expect bitcoin.org to have no basic security requirements?
@_date: 2015-01-01 06:08:27
Thanks for the kind words :) Truly appreciated. I'm always trying to see what can be done better.
@_date: 2015-01-25 11:58:03
Maybe. I guess it's not all black or white, at the same time Circle is one of the few wallets with mandatory 2FA, or insuring all their users funds (if I understand their offer correctly). It sometime happens that developers are hard to reach, it's hard to draw any conclusion only from one event. Apparently they will add hsts.
@_date: 2015-01-25 04:48:01
Again, the requirement was submitted once all wallet developers agreed this was a good thing and didn't report no issue whatsoever. This is hardly being coercisive.
Later in the GitHub thread, one Celery developer mentioned a first case where enabling HSTS could be problematic due to Google App Engine, and was clearly not told "Do as I say"
@_date: 2014-04-17 16:08:40
My understanding is they couldn't buy the domain name, so bitcoin.com is still basically a billboard owned by domain squatters. For a few months, it was used by StrongCoin, then Coinbase, and now Blockchain.info.

Thanks for opening a pull request!

As the person who wrote the mission above, I also wish bitcoin.org (or competing website) provided neutral information and research about both side of the block size debate (but this takes time, talent and dedicated people).
I am also disappointed by the bans / censorships on political and sensitive topics in general, I support free access to information and this goes against my own values. I don't believe this is positive for the Bitcoin ecosystem overall, the result is too divisive and doesn't help increase awareness and education IMO.
@_date: 2015-07-25 18:50:38
That's the point of HD wallets, you only need to backup your wallet once. Making a backup of individual private keys is the real danger here, not change addresses.
@_date: 2015-07-06 17:00:30
It is always frustrating to me when I read people assuming the Foundation or any sponsorship is what built bitcoin.org when I (and every other contributors) mostly always worked for free.
You can attribute some cool stuff to the sponsorship, including many full translations, the HTTPS hosting and some extra hours spent on the site, but the vast majority of the work was achieved without any funding whatsoever.
Roger Ver's contribution to the Foundation has certainly been very helpful to what they've achieved, but the Foundation has done much more than sponsoring bitcoin.org (events, funding core developers, lobbying), and a significant number of individuals and businesses donated to the Foundation as well.
@_date: 2015-07-06 21:12:15
Thanks, it's always great to get some appreciation :)
The Foundation is currently the sole sponsor (with a $2000/month bounty which is about to end next month).
You can get details about bitcoin.org's expenses thanks to the excellent blog posts from : 
You can also get previous reports from the blog of the Foundation (sorry I don't have the links at hand).

More details about the issue:
@_date: 2015-04-05 15:38:53
The Foundation doesn't own the domain. However someone has to pay for the hosting. Which can be quite costly for a high traffic and often DDoSed website.
@_date: 2015-04-05 21:23:32
I haven't said that either :) I only said reliable funding was needed.
@_date: 2015-04-05 17:17:21
It's currently within the range you're mentioning (585$/month with BlackLotus, and DigitalOcean for VM build machines). There is some good reasons to keep away from Cloudflare.

Good reaction. 
The torrent contains the signed SHA256SUMS.asc file to let you verify the integrity of the release and make sure it is signed by Wladimir.
This link is also the one permanently available on the right panel on this sub-reddit -&gt;
@_date: 2015-11-07 07:38:07
The torrent contains whatever Core developers choose to add on bitcoin.org/bin/, it is generated automatically.

Hey, thank you very much :)
@_date: 2015-02-16 09:29:03
Bitcoin Core can now also be downloaded using BitTorrent:
Or use the magnet link on the download page:
Seeding this torrent can help decentralizing the downloads and make them more accessible for countries where bitcoin.org is unreachable, or in the case bitcoin.org experiences downtime.
@_date: 2015-02-05 02:53:15
They're actually OK either ways.
@_date: 2015-02-05 02:52:35
I think there has been a bit too much drama about this in the first place. HSTS support isn't a huge security issue and Circle were collaborative and quick to make improvements once it was possible to speak to the right person.
@_date: 2015-02-23 15:46:02
That's very disappointing, any idea of a good replacement?

I remember that! And yes, David is a machine :) You forget to say you also helped finding technical mistakes there and there afterwhile.
For clarity: The Foundation provided some funding in the past, but the majority of the work on bitcoin.org was volunteer work.

The site hosts a formatted version perhaps a bit more readable:

You're welcome! You can go on Transifex (as stated above) and ask to join the Russian team, you should usually be accepted in the next hours. After what you'll be able to see / improve (if required) what has been done already &amp; provide missing translations. Thanks for your help.
