It's a nice choice for people in markets where paypal is not in, or people who want to buy stuff online but don't have a bank account.
The thing I like about bitcoin is financial inclusion. Noone is excluded from being a customer just because a bank says no to them.

digitalcurrencyaustralia.com is also another place for buying BTC and other cryptos, but the spread is a bit higher because you don't need to be verified.
They were formerly (and still) dogecoinaustralia.com but have branched out to other cryptos. 
I've bought DOGE off them before. But I don't know about larger orders &gt;$1000 in one go which probably may have the usual AML/KYC checks.
Depending on where you are you may find one way bitcoin ATMs (the lamassu ones don't need ID) to buy BTC with cold hard cash. Although the spread is higher and you definitely don't want to be carrying too much cash to them.

according to bitcoinfees the median fee is about 40 cents. Fees are still the same bitcoin wise, but because the value of bitcoin is rising - dollar wise it is more expensive.
Market cap is roughly 20 billion. If it were to hit 100 billion, it would be roughly 5 times more. 5*40 cents = $2.
I don't have a problem with fees, but right now it's not good for small ticket items (buying coffee / beer / lunch). It's still better than SWIFT or Gold.
@_date: 2017-02-08 06:34:22
Well Nakamoto means Central, and Satoshi means smart/intelligent.
Maybe a name of a certain 3 letter agency?
@_date: 2017-02-25 00:40:18

Another reason not to use google play or use google play services.
There is a need for an Android App Store which is decentralized, and accepts bitcoin for paid apps.

You can even pay with lightning
@_date: 2019-11-07 02:37:34
Room 77 in Berlin takes bitcoin and lightning but not cards. 
It’s easier to accept bitcoin than credit cards. And cheaper too.
Accepting bitcoin: easy as downloading wallet from play or App Store and follow instructions. Can even download a lightning wallet if one wants to. 
Accept credit cards: Apply for payment processor. Submit lots of docs regarding business, ownership, and income. Don’t get rejected because the processor doesn’t like your business or something missing in paperwork. Get hit with 2-3% fees every time someone pays you. Don’t get paid right away. Maybe get a chargeback because someone used a stolen or cloned card.

Put all of it in BTC, but have a dollar cost averaging plan.
Having the extra cash to treat yourself is nice too, but only if you have self control.

That’s true about the hard part but some people might pay in bitcoin
@_date: 2019-11-27 11:26:58
That wouldn't be good for traders. Anyone who "stacks sats" still has to go through someone giving liquidity to the market.
Better that exchanges have competent people running them or better to have some good DEXs with good UX

Then you just earn back (or buy back) that bitcoin you spent.

That is true but the problem with gold is not many people have physical possession of it, so you end up with counterparty risk.

The miners can only follow the protocol set by the code.
If miners were to shutdown, all that would happen is bitcoin becomes slower in block times until the network difficulty re-adjusts for the new miners.
Price might even rise as it would cost more in electricity to produce a block.

Bitcoin could be also similar to how protocols are on the internet. They have been around for a while but the average layperson doesn't know it is behind the scenes.
IPv4 for instance. Still powers most of the internet, even though IPv6 is superior.

+1 for coinpayments. Use it to accept many cryptos and you can choose to keep it or convert it to your chosen crypto.
As it's crypto only no kyc 
@_date: 2018-02-12 04:03:07
Also if bitcoin falls, ALL cryptos fall. During the fall from 20k to 6k, everything was red. 
But theres still other good cryptos out there that I like: Litecoin, Monero, Dash, and NEO (China hedge).

Use alt coin/crypto only exchanges. They usually don't need to do KYC as they don't touch fiat at all.

A potential candidate to replacing the DNS system.
- Use public keys to verify that you're the owner (or multi-sig tech if there are multiple owners) without a centralized authority.
- Records can't be changed
- Cannot be stopped by anyone unless they gain complete control over the network. Say goodbye to DNS censorship.
- Infrastructure, Investment and developer ecosystem is already there in other aspects of the protocol.

The best self defense is not to get into the fight in the first place.
If someone wants you bad enough, theres always a way.
Good opsec practices like not disclosing your stash, or where the stash is or even having anything to anyone that you don't know well. Even people you know should not know how much you have.
Also limit what information can be obtained about you on the internet (birthdays, place of birth, maiden names, etc) which can be used in social engineering attacks.
Also showing off any wealth may also attract attention too (including tax authorities)
