What? Switching blockchain? Why not, Segwit has a nummer of advantages.

I know it's a softfork, but on the nano ledger the switch in address is indicated by "changing" blockchains. 
As I don't plan to do many transactions with my BTC (mainly an investment at this moment), I just wanted to have it done now.

Ok, so because it's a transfer between personal accounts I should just wait then. No sense of urgency to have it confirmed faster.

I'd like to start with buying and trading coins. What bank is recommended for someone living in Europe (Belgium). Thinking about coin base/kraken, but I'd like a know more about the fees for funding, trading and witdrawal.
Any European here who can pass  me some first learnings?

I'm trying to buy some coins but verification on kraken and coinbase take a while! And then I still need to transfer some money.... it all takes a lot of time and in the meantime, prices keep increasing.

Will it? Will it dip? Can you be sure ;-)?

Curious though, I would expect people to start selling because it's at an all-time-high? Or am I mistaken?

Exactly, I'm trying to avoid exorbitant credit card fees by using bank transfer.

I'm trying to buy, but account/payment verification takes like forever on Kraken/Coinbase. And I just see those prices increase and increase... ffs

Oh god, and here I am, stuck at this verification process. Not being able to buy. This sucks! :-)
