I recognize it could all go belly up tomorrow. The world could also implode tomorrow. But past experience states the sun will *most likely* rise tomorrow, and looking at all previous and present indicators, Bitcoin will also rise in value again the way it has every single other time it has dipped. Until it is obsoleted by something else, I suspect the value will continue to rise. Christmas money is also about to start flowimg in. And wait until tax return time.

Already flirting with 17k again, I bet it hits 19k by end of day tomorrow

No offense, but this explains her reaction a little ��

Last year it was under 1000. Bitcoin price is still incredibly high. Perspective people
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:41:44
Dude why would you not buy the dip we just had? Nearly 40% profits if it hits 19k again, which it looks like it will surpass shorlty.

How did the price just dip 300$ in a split second?
edit: sorry, I should have been more specific. I've been holding a small amount of btc for about two years, selling and buying here and there on coinbase. recently started watching GDAX and trying to understand the order book and line charts and graphs. It seemed like it was a long drawn out steady climb to ~19000, a large pause at 18,999.99 and 19,000 for about 5 minutes, then in an instant it was 18700. Is it a single large sell that ca n manipulate the volatility like that?

The amount of people buying has gone up.  More demand, less supply = more value.  Is that not accurate?

Yeah, it wasnt long ago Coinbase had a major sell off and no transfers went unfilled. It was millions of dollars in the matter of a few hours if I remember correctly

Dont people ever get tired of trying to predict the price and failing?

Its called Investment Fraud, and there are actual laws against it.  Theres no law against people complaining on the internet about all the pitfalls of the current banking systems. This is why its hard to take you seriously, vs. Hiring a lawyer to sue you for breaking some imaginary law that doesnt exist

That depends. Is the money you cirrently have invested money you need immediately?  If you sell at +$400 from what you purchased, would that profit make you happy if the price is +$3000 in 4 months? Many people try to buy low sell high for modest profits but most often this market is far too unpredictable. The o my thing that has been predictable for this commodity is that over the long term, it grows. Short term is total guesswork. It just dropped nearly $1800 dollars last week and is now up +1000. 
My advice, make this part of your long term savings and just hold (Hodl as the BTC community likes to say)

Thats an interesting point. What happens to lost bitcoins. Ones that are on paper wallets and their owners die or in accounts and the owners die or lose access... 
Is that currency then gone forever? Isn't it feasible that the currency could fail due to the severe loss rates over time? Its barely in infancy and already nearly a million coins have been lost??
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:49:30
I sold right before coinbase crashed, hoping it comes up before the price goes up again..
@_date: 2017-05-11 00:59:16
I think you need to give it more then a few hours before calling it tested.

Does anyone have any idea what the concept of a structurally limited supply of a currency will have on its use, acceptance, and value?

Bro, do you even English?
