As one of those noobs whom only recently started investigating the crypto space, I'm glad to see responses from veterans. Here here!

Just curious as to what are the alternatives to buying LTC, BTC and ETH with fiat?

Same thing happened to me in Communism101.. Someone asked me if Stalin was really THAT bad. Told them to read the Gulag Archipelago...
I could make a cheap juxtaposition...

Interesting that crypto has changed your opinion on such a topic, Australia has an exceptionally patriotic culture that's almost a sin to push back against or at least not buy into. 
My two cents. Patriotism does have utility. But in my experience community and systems that transcend national/ethnic identity offer a superior experience and greater rewards and lessen the likelihood of conflict. A set of values that engender one with a duty to behave with virtue and responsibility beyond kith and kin. 
To me, crypto has the power to side step and potentially disrupt the financial systems and their toxic self serving ties to government. It has no regard for ones national identity, race, religious, political beliefs or social class. There is no middle man to conveniently take a cut depending on any of the above, be they banks or government. We just have to ensure it stays this way. State/corporate backed cryptocurrency could quite easily undermine all of these principles as far as this cat is concerned.
