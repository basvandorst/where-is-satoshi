The word "Bitcoin" is just so tainted with negativity. I don't see how it will possibly overcome the label. People will end up going with an altcoin and it will go mainstream and they will love it way more than this "Bitcoin"...even though its almost exactly the same, they will think it's much better and different than evil, scammy Bitcoin.

I have money invested heavily into Bitcoin. I lost a good amount yesterday. I found the memes to be quite entertaining and the only thing to put a smile on my face in a time of despair. However, the OP makes a very solid point in that it:  
"discourages new consumers and business owners from taking bitcoin seriously."
So if there is any chance that these meme's are turning people away from getting involved in Bitcoin and costing the price of Bitcoin to go up in any way, then put the meme's here: @_date: 2013-12-20 16:34:17
They have 5 twitter followers. I'm not making this shit up. This news is voted to the top of r/bitcoin? Comeon, I'm all for positive news to help Bitcoin acceptance spread, but this intentionally confuses people into thinking "Ace Hardware" is accepting Bitcoin when in fact it's just 1 Ace Hardware, privately owned with no web based following.

I'm a huge Bitcoin enthusiast, but I am also living in reality. That would be great if Bitcoin was one day the world currency and there was no need for cash. But Im talking about in the next 6 months, if all banks stop dealing with any businesses and/or exchanges that deal in Bitcoin. Then all we are left with is Bitcoin. And what business is going to want to accept Bitcoin if they can only trade it? Businesses are accepting Bitcoin because Bitpay and Coinbase give them the option to instantly convert to fiat.

why did it go from 208 to 160ish late last night? I didn't panic sell but I was panicking. Whats gonna stop that from happening tonight? It's great that BTC is showing resiliency, but at some points last night, it looked like it could possibly continue the downward spiral and not rebound.

they are so full of shit. They put this out to scare people away from bitcoin.

The nice thing about Coinbase is that they give you the ability to cancel the order. So if BTC goes down to $300, you can cancel at any time before they arrive.  
*** I believe this feature is only available during situations like this when there are no Bitcoin for immediate sale. The good thing is, I think it will be over $1000 by Friday.

he says that if Government shuts Bitcoin down, it will still live and possibly just go underground. And goes on to explain how you can go through customs with a USB drive with a Billion $ on it. But if the whole world bans Bitcoin and theres no way in any Country to convert your Bitcoin back to your dollars, then isn't it pointless? I know its unlikly that every single Gov't will shut down Bitcoin, and by shutdown I mean don't allow banks/exchanges to operate/convert in Bitcoin....But if that does happen, then yes you still have the Bitcoin protocol that can't be shut down, but where's the value if you can never convert it back to some/any currency used by main society?

Whats wrong with wearing a BTC tshirt around? Are you worried about your "image"?  If you believe in Bitcoin or you are just in it as an investment, a t-shirt can draw attention to Bitcoin and help increase exposure. It's not even a close comparison to a vanity license plate. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 17:43:46
OK, so I didn't read through the whole thing because Im lazy and have OCD, so maybe you covered this.

this is the funniest shit ive ever seen...and totally accutate

are you kidding? CNBC has a huge following and a huge following of wealth. Usually they are snickering and snarling at Bitcoin. This video at least showed a little respect towards Bitcoin

after all the bitching and complaining about r/bitcoin being littered with "Fake News" and "BS Stories", this story gets voted to the top while the source is some tiny Bitcoin News website that no ones ever heard of? Comeon guys, WTF are you doing? 
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:10:06
Fear and greed is what runs most of trading and investing. At least that's what I've heard. But what do I know, I'm the dummy that just sold
@_date: 2013-10-26 02:11:42
You make a good point. We all want Bitcoin to become mainstream. I think you are saying that this volatility will scare away potential merchants from accepting bitcoin as a form of payment. We need bitcoin to become as mainstream as possible and have as many places as possible accept bitcoin. 
Good Point: "This is just the gentle agitations of the first cryptocurrency as it consumes excess liquidity and then shakes itself off before jumping back in the water."

see the prob is newbies dont understand that. It sounds Chinese. How do I make a wallet? How do I encrypt it? How do I back it up? People don't know what a 2fa seed is. You have to explain it step by step as if you are teaching someone a new language.

Litecoin, IMO, is a joke. It is bought by trolls that can not afford a full Bitcoin. Why would Litecoin succeed and Bitcoin fail? It wouldn't
@_date: 2013-11-24 03:25:43

If I sell 1 BTC at $350 and it instantly drops to $300, am I 100% locked in at that $350 or has anyone heard of a sell order getting cancelled?
@_date: 2013-11-10 05:39:12
They are based out of Russia or Bulgaria and I was asking the same question. I heard that no one really knows who owns it...so personally, I haven't and wouldn't put even a dime into it. I could be wrong, but that's my opinion.  I use Coinbase for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-10-30 04:11:17
nice job dude! I did too. It is only going to help the growth of Bitcoin
@_date: 2013-11-10 05:47:35

you can just watch the video and see what they say ;)
@_date: 2013-12-17 02:55:27
Why is he a liar? Maybe that's what the rep told him. And as for the Chinese news, there's no good news about it. It might not be what you wanna hear, but its the truth. 
@_date: 2013-10-29 06:45:53
Nice! Everyone should post a replay and let them know you would like Bitcoin as a payment option and you would use it
@_date: 2013-11-01 02:08:25
Thats a real stupid title and summary of this post. Coinbase is awesome. All websites have issues from time to time. Give em a break, geez.

What would be so much better is if you could buy 10 BTC per day "instantly", rather than 10 per week :/
@_date: 2013-11-10 05:24:59
well said. I hate that mofo. I read both his stupid ass articles. He is arrogant and cocky and misinformed.

If you have a Coinbase.com account, you can just ask for your waiter/waitress email. Then from your Coinbase account, send your desired amount to their email. When they recieve the email, there will be simple instructions for them on how to open a Coinbase account and their Bitcoin's will be in there :)

Litecoin and other altcoins can only hurt the progression of the entire cyrto currency movement. Society needs to fully adopt Bitcoin before you give them alternative digital currencies. Look how confused people are already. I think it's stupid and people won't understand that even though 1 BTC is $900, you can buy a portion of a bitcoin. They will see a 1 Litecoin for $20 and think that's a better deal, when in fact, its not.  And I think that's why we aren't going to see MtGox, Bitstamp or Coinbase offer Litecoin for a long time. But wtf do I know
@_date: 2013-12-24 02:27:56
no but Im saying buy 10 instantly every day if you are level 4 verified. Then you could day trade a little easier. Because Im not trusting leaving my money on BTC-E.com

Just look at his picture in the article. You can tell hes a miserable piece of shit.
@_date: 2013-12-17 05:37:10
I don't know either. It's simple for a lot of these tech guys, but what about the average dude that finds Bitcoin intriguing? This is a huge turn-off. I do have faith, however, that the Bitcoin world will make the appropriate upgrades and fixes and we will see another huge run and adoption with much more simplicity.

What happens if all banks say this? How would you convert your Bitcoin to fiat if you needed to?
@_date: 2013-11-01 03:44:38
If you want to invest, why not just go buy bitcoins...am I missing something?
@_date: 2013-11-11 05:53:24
I bet you he was being 100% serious. Roy Hibbert is my new favorite NBA player.  He just had to say he was kidding because its a liability to give out investment advice. I bet you he's reading this reddit thread right now! What up Roy!!!
@_date: 2013-12-14 07:42:56
I love Coinbase and their entire staff! They just gotta make sure the chart loads every time as well as fixing the charts custom date range. Tighten up those loose ends :)
@_date: 2013-11-06 22:48:11
That guy Joe Weisenthal is a fucking moron and I can't even began to tell you how stupid Maria Bartiromo is. Im actually relieved she is not a Bitcoin supporter because she's wrong about everything else that comes out of her mouth
