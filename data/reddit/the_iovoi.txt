But the us government is tangible, it has people, banks and most importantly cash. It is backed by a military, powerful gdp and tangible goods. Bitcoin is only exchangeable for other currencies, it is linked to nothing but other currencies.

Except that fiat isn’t based on a bunch of people betting on it. It’s tied to real life productions and the strength of the country. There’s a reason that shitty country’s have shitty economies and strong countries have powerful economies. Please educate yourself before acting like bitcoin is gonna be the next big thing because it sounds cool

Do you really think people don’t trust in the US dollar? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:22:19
Yes it does, a government backed currency is used to buy good produced and sold by that country. Without that currency you would not be able to buy the goods that country sells and produces.

Bitcoins entire existence is a bubble. Bitcoin has literally no intrinsic value. It’s only value is what people are willing to give it. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:28:54
Stocks* in general make profit over time. Bitcoin is more comparable to a venture capitalist, you might make an insane amount of money or you might get fucked 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:30:54
Yes those are all things that bitcoin “has”. But what do they do except create and manage bitcoin? What does bitcoin actually have or make. The answer is nothing except itself. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:00:19
Well you didn't seem to understand it so maybe you did need it explained 
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:09:54
I know right, some people in this sub are borderline conspiracy theorists...
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:04:58
Yes but who cares where your trading if you have no way to convert it to usd. An overwhelming majority of people who are invested in bitcoin are doing it for short term monetary gain. They don’t believe in bitcoin they just want to see it double then cash out. If they lose their ability to cash out then it’s gonna be worthless, who’s gonna buy it if they can’t sell it 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:32:11
Literally all the us government has to do is seize the exchanges, and poof, there goes bitcoin. It’s value would crash to practically 0 overnight 
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:19:09
I mean I made a little profit then cashed out, I hope you enjoy your profits but keep in mind that like literally everything there is a risk in bitcoin. The us government is another risk on top of the risk of it just crashing randomly 
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:02:25
Let’s just say if the us collapses then bitcoins value is the least of your problems. America is literally the single most important player in the world today. It’s economic impact is second only to China, and its military is the most powerful and influential in the world. If the USD collapses then expect the entire economic system to collapse along with it 
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:29:02
You realize by the time the us collapses (if ever) you’ll be long gone? A company with by far the most powerful economy, with a well educated population and a firm set of well enforced laws is EXTREMELY unlikely to fail.
@_date: 2017-09-03 03:53:37
Please do explain 
@_date: 2017-09-07 21:26:32
A bet a lot of them weren't being sarcastic, according to some people in this sub the government is an evil horrible entity that wants to ruin you and your entire life and bitcoin is the only way to save ourselves from them (even though bitcoin is literally valued in relation to a government backed currency) 
@_date: 2019-01-08 08:33:26
Don’t mind the bot / troll. Literally anything you say will be thrown back at you like a monkey throwing his shit in a fit of rage. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 21:08:02
What... the US dollar is one of the most if not the most important currency ever, stop demonizing one of the building blocks of the modern economy 
@_date: 2017-09-14 03:22:01
What kind of government declares their currency valueless? That's just a stupid line of reasoning 
@_date: 2017-09-08 21:30:32
Then when it's hits 0 you buy more, then you cry because you lost so much money being an idiot 
@_date: 2017-09-10 20:32:37
No it wouldn't, the crime wouldn't have had anything to do with trade or US trading laws so the US wouldn't have any jurisdiction 
@_date: 2017-09-10 02:43:13
Where is Coinbase in all this, I thought they were the biggest bitcoin exchange? 
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:47:13
And that is a consensus among the miners, I never claimed that there was a consensus within the community. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 00:57:35
Can someone explain to me why that's so high to people? I bought 150$ of bitcoin and there was like a 6 dollar fee, that doesn't seem that ridiculous to me
@_date: 2017-09-08 21:52:41
That's not how this works, most people with money don't have such a zealous fixed love for bitcoin, if it drops and is losing a lot of money their gonna cut their loses and sell. Sure you might not but what's your bitcoin to the hundreds of thousands of dollars worth owned by big investors and companies 
@_date: 2017-09-01 19:40:06
You were lucky, congratulations that it worked out but it could have just as easily not caught on and you could've lost everything 
@_date: 2017-09-17 04:52:28
Except you can't call bullshit that's not how it works, these websites aren't lying to you because hur dur jpmorgan wants to lower prices and buy the dip it's because they actually think it's a fraud. Their clients are the ones buying bitcoin because people don't understand bitcoin but want to invest in it, so they go to their bank and tell them to buy bitcoin for them. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 17:06:28
I'm not claiming to be a professional trader, but I know enough about stocks and investments to know only a complete idiot invests everything into one asset, no matter what it is 
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:44:27
What the hell are you talking about, a Narcan shot is the absolute last thing an addict wants, it’s literally instant withdrawal and has been described as one of the most painful experiences ever. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:37:49
You are not a professional trader, no professional trader worth a nickel would dump all their assets into bitcoin or any crypto currency, its extremely risky and honestly stupid. And what kind of professional trader dumps everything into one asset, diversifying is one of the most important things for a healthy and safe portfolio. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 21:41:26
Who do you think supports the business's that you buy things from? Who do you think owns the land that those business's are on? How would bitcoin even have a value without government currency? 
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:17:48
There is an overwhelming majority that is signaling nya, I would call that a consensus. 
noun: consensus; plural noun: consensuses
general agreement.
@_date: 2018-07-14 20:33:09
Only a problem if your lame af
@_date: 2017-09-08 21:34:25
You act as if that isn't a possibility, crypto is a very new, unregulated and volatile market that has anonymous buyers and no oversight. It could very easily crash to 0 or near 0. Now I'm not saying it will (I hope it doesn't I have money in it) but acting as if that isn't a possibility is just stupid
