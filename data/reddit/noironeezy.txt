my guess is that everyone is buying bitcoin not as a currency, but as a precious commodity, like gold/silver. Combine this with the fact that the market is incredibly illiquid because of the limited number of bitcoin and bitcoin for sale, and you have the conditions for a run in price. 
Look at the tradedata for Mtgox. For every $1 increase ($17-$18) in the ask, there is only about 1000-2000 bitcoin or sale. If you do the math, that means you only need about $17000-$34000 cash to cause the price in Bitcoin to increase by $1. Sounds like a lot of money, but Wall Street traders and big investors wipe their ass with that kind of money. The article in Forbes probably sparked some interest in some traders who said: "what the hell, why not?" A minor investment in Bitcoin, say $10-20K, would cause a fairly large splash in this market. 
TL;DR -  review supply/demand curve 
EDIT: also, regarding all the "bubble" talk - i dont think so. reason: a bubble will only pop when the buying support weakens after a run in price, usually due to a glut of supply. Everybody knows about the supply: 21million bitcoin. Nobody can come into the market without buying bitcoin first. In other words, noone can flood the market with bitcoin for sale unless they bought them first (no short sales). And noone can create "new" bitcoins outside of the existing (will exist) 21 million. Think back to the tech and real estate bubbles. What did they have in common? Potential for neverending supply. Any business could become a .com (pets.com, stamps.com), and developers could create a huge amount of property from previously undeveloped land.
