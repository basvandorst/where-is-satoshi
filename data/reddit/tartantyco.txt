No, that's just shit that you're making up.
@_date: 2014-10-15 20:52:48
Or maybe, instead of just randomly making shit up to fit your preconceived notions, you could just open a damn history book?
The USA has had an uninterrupted political establishment since its inception. Even through their civil war.
Great Britain has had the same political establishment intact since the Restoration in 1660.
[Tell me what major political upheaval occurred in Norway that caused same-sex sexual activity to become legal in 1972.](
This isn't something you have to hypothesize. This isn't something that's hard to look up.

You may want to look that word up in the dictionary.


Any organizational structure relies on this. It is entirely unavoidable. The question is where this authority is derived from. In the case of the Democratic nation-state, it is derived from the people.

No, I'm taking specific issue with the fact that you're historically illiterate, and you're using that as an excuse to say stupid shit on the internet. You have no point.
All the morality laws that have been cut down. All the expansions of freedom of speech and freedom of the press. All the expansions on voting rights. And these have happened under the same political structures, with the same political establishments. You don't have a fucking leg to stand on.

Do you know what happened when Norway made same-sex sexual activity in 1972? They passed a law.
Know how the fucking legislative process works. Everything the government does involves laws and regulations. Want to abolish the NSA? You make a law. Want to reduce government military expenditure? You make a law.
I mean, what the fuck? Is sheer ignorance the only fuel you people run on?

And they are able to exist because they operate within a system organized by aggression, coercion, and violence. How many voluntary organizations operate in unrestrained competition with organizations supported by aggression, coercion, and violence?

No, they didn't go to America to escape the oppressive regime. God, is your knowledge of history made up solely of propaganda and fantasy? As with every other damn human migration, they went because there was free land.
Governments are tools of social organization. They are neither good or evil, they are simply the best method of allowing a community to survive and prosper. There's a reason why there aren't any stateless utopias in the world.
As a result of the establishment of the democratic nation-state, we live in a world of unparalleled peace, safety, and prosperity. As a general trend, the democratic nation-state has moved in the direction of greater liberalism and personal freedoms. The only times this trend is reversed is when the people don't involve themselves politically, and when society is exposed to a new paradigm shift(In this case, global communication technology and the digital age).
The reason why morality laws exist is because the people wanted them. Because, you know, in the past people were actual, raging, homophobic racists. It's not because of government. It's because of people. People are the reason why slavery was deemed acceptable. People are why segregation was acceptable in the US South. The US government is the reason why segregation in the US South ended.

Or how about the vast majority of Western nations going from Feudal Monarchies to Representative Democracies? Or the US going from only allowing white, land-owning men to vote, to universal suffrage?
How ignorant can you possibly be to say something as obviously untrue as this:

Just keep living in your fantasy world, dude.
@_date: 2014-10-15 21:19:43
Well, I'm glad your ability to ignore the facts is still operating at optimum capacity.

The meaning of my statement is obvious. They are able to exist because their rights are protected by the state.


Markets are inherently violent.


Yes. The answer is none.
@_date: 2014-10-15 21:40:15
That's not how trolling works, but I'm sure it's a convenient excuse for you to ignore the facts and continue living in your fantasy bubble.
@_date: 2014-10-16 01:57:22
Then you would be wrong.

It's a bit more complicated than that. Many states have never had laws against it, while others only adopted them relatively recently. And now we're talking about legal as in codified into law. That does not mean that tribal communities, or other pre-government societies, allowed it.
Legality, especially when it comes to morality laws, is most often a reflection of the society in which it exists. If homosexuality is made illegal, it is often as a result of prevailing opinion, and homosexuals would likely face repercussions regardless of the legal status of homosexuality. Neither would they have any legal recourse for harassment or abuse directed at them because of their homosexuality.

And that's why homosexuality was legal before, and is now a crime.  
Wait, I think I got that one the wrong way around.
