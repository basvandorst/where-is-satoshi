I don't think it is super accurate. It lists two of my old nodes that have been dead for weeks.

Having someone in charge of proposals is not the point. These stupid titles reveal their true mindset.

sure, but that does not make this post any less incorrect.

It's not only about price, but also about  independence and control.

This is about a different incident, not todays crash.

One thing you can do is never click on any links from email but always go to the website manually.

Sms based 2fa has not been really safe for a long time afaik. I would not give too much trust to anything phone based. For scary examples see

There already exist lightweight clients that work in that way, for example electrum:

I've had a similar issue on linux for a while. The client would take 20 minutes to start if I was mining at the same time, and in about 10 seconds if I was not. Not sure what caused this, but it has gone away by itself some time ago.

Lost about 24BTC, don't expect anything back really.

yes, transfer of ownership of coins is registered in bitcoin data blocks. You will not be able to spend the coins until your bitcoin client has received those blocks containing coins sent to you.

I actually made a (very) simple 'print-your-own' card generator a while ago. 
So you can easily print a bunch of them on sturdy paper and just hand them out.

Thanks, the ampersand issue should be fixed now.
The issue with chrome is actually a bug with printing of svg files in chrome, so not much I can do there unfortunately.

Hmm, I'd be hesitant to put my money here. It may be a test version, but it is lacking even the most basic validations like for negative prices or amounts.

bitfloor hit 93.99 already today.. does that count? :)
@_date: 2013-04-04 21:23:31
Bitfloor has been make small repayments. I have gotten about 0.75 btc back sofar and have about 23.5 bitcoins still on hold at bitfloor. Still I prefer this above getting nothing back. Other than that bitfloor has always worked well for me and I'm still using it. I didn't ever try to deposit usd though since I'm not in the US, so don't how well that works.

By coming here he created a fork in the timeline.. we just got the good side :)
@_date: 2013-03-30 11:42:52
I do most of my trading on bitfloor mostly because it offers a small rebate (negative fee sort of) for putting orders on the orderbook. Anybody know if other exchanges do this?
@_date: 2013-03-30 11:35:33
I sent you some :)

While SHA256 is the basis of bitcoin hashing, the operation that these asics do is specific to bitcoin. 
So they're useless for anything else.
@_date: 2013-03-27 17:43:21
That was probably an error, because I can't see it on bitstamp itself.

I think if you ask 100 people to give you four or five random words, you will find a lot of common words. I don't trust myself as a random generator and will never use a brainwallet.
