Nice paper full of direct comparisons to bitcoin and an excellent discussion of mathematics.

Nonsense. Bitcoin is mentioned 22 times. Monero is mentioned 23 times. 
You really think one more out of the combined 45 mentions between the two means this absolutely needs to be on a different subreddit than this one?

Again, nonsense.
This paper is mostly about mathematics in Bitcoin and Monero. The fact that both are mentioned equally just leans more to the fact that the paper is just as much about Bitcoin as it is Monero.
Cryptocurrencies as a whole are spoken of only five times.
So now the paper is about 10% cryptocurrencies as a whole, 44% about Bitcoin and 46% about Monero.
Only if you take a look at the paper, the word "Monero", "Bitcoin" and "Cryptocurrencies" doesn't even appear on over fifteen pages. That's all discussion about math.
So now there's a paper here that's 5% about cryptocurrencies, 22% about Bitcoin, 23% about Monero and 50% about pure mathematics.
Sorry such a nice paper about mathematics came around and disrupted your keen discussion about 'Scumbag Banks' and 'Cryptsy.com is down (add: so I can't trade my altcoins)'.

Observing the codebase, and making the statement that the codebase is atrocious by orders of magnitude hardly seems like an opinion to me, especially from someone as knowledgeable as Peter Todd.
The statement is, or once was, a verifiable fact, and was not some 'opinion' pulled out of nowhere. It's your opinion that it's an opinion, if anything.
It shouldn't matter if it was Peter Todd or Greg Maxwell that made the statement, as it's publicly observable information right on github. Nobody disagreed with him.
The paper states this : "cryptonote introduced a special form of linkable ring signatures suitable for use in Bitcoin"
Cryptonote did not introduce new cryptography, so it seems that it's the codebase that both Poelstra and Maxwell were referring to in the paper.

Sure seems like it.
Question is, why are bitcoin developers looking at integrating cryptonote technology on one hand, while simultaneously making claims that it's premature, unpolished and dangerous? I specifically remember Peter Todd mentioning that the protocol was exactly this: "The Cryptonote/Bytecoin codebase  is based on is atrociously bad, orders of magnitude worse than  but now I'm wondering if he had an ulterior motive..
If it's any of the three things mentioned above, then why are they looking at putting it into Bitcoin?

This checks out

It's actually trivial to verify this, and literally any piece is verifiable. Please consult for some genuine help in understanding this.
That being said, there are many real reasons a privacy coin will not be likely to overtake bitcoin. Most of them are not directly related to Kyle Torpey's opinions at all. In the future, please consider formulating opinions from a credible source rather than someone who has, for the entirety of their existence, created two twitter bots. Note that he has not published whether or not he is a mathematician or even a coder on this website, so I would take his salt with a big glass.
Kyle's website is here, for those interested: [

I'm fairly certain it was from both basements, back alleyways, and quiet gatherings on totally isolated landmasses that DPC even began as an idea in the first place.

Great idea.

Cash has serial numbers for doing just that, lol.
Plus, it doesn't fit through my ethernet cable..
