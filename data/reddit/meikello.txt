Of course just the winner get the reward, but this is also true for the fees.
Nearly 166 Blocks are mined a day. and each Blocks is worth $125000 without fees. So I think they don't have to win much to make profit.

1) You don't have to close the chanel
2) When more people use LN the mempool emptys and the fees drop.

Nothing. They restarted their client.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:58:27
You are mixing two different things. The creation of the Blocks doesn't cost so much energy. You could do it with a raspberry pi. 
The problem is that the rigth to mine the next block is awarded by solving a cryptographic riddle and mining a block gives you nearly $100.000. So many people are trying to win this lottery (seperadly) and using much energy

Miners only determine the order of transactions. Nothing more. They control nothing and even with 51% they can't double-spend a coin. Every attemp would be rejected by the network itself.

I really don't think this is an issue. The miners aren't stupid. They know that bitcoin has to success. The market worth of all other cryptos is near to zero.
Ether for example isn't worth $300. It is worth ~0.09 BTC.
If Bitcoin fails all other cryptos will do too.

No, i never made a locked transaction, but you don't have to reveal your secret key, it is on github so others are reviewing it and they are active in the community [  
So I would trust them if it isn't a whole Bitcoin we are talking about.
@_date: 2019-10-29 16:09:08
You can make this pretty easy with:
You have to enter the public key and the Date and it will generate a Hodl Adreess. Any BTC you send to this Adress you can Redeem by signing a transaction with the private key corresponding to the public key and of course after the Date you choose.  
Please verify the Hodl Adreess (its possible on the same page) and make a test transaction on testnet or with a low amount and a close date .

I'm not on their side, but this is fair.
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:52:43
That isn't complitly true. Many Wallets don't recognize the format so you can't send it directly to the bech32-adress. You have to use a none-segwit wallet in Electrum as an intermediate stage.
But from bech32 adresses you can send to all other adresses without a problem.

Nobody knows this.
In the split second after the fork it will have the same value, but the bt2 market has a very low volumen.
As we have seen during the Bcash fork the price had ricen to nearly 0,5 btc and then crashed to &gt; 0,1 btc.
And Bcash could survive because it was a clear fork with replay protection and everything. SegWit2x not. So only one chain will survive and my odds are totaly in favor of BTC. It migth be that Segwit2x will not even happen so that you would lose all your the true BTC you put in BT2.

Signaling doesn't mean they run btc1 or anything alike. They are just writing NYA in the coinbase. To erase that they have to restart and this costs time they can't mine. They will do it when they have to restart anyway.

On certain exchanges you cant trade 1 BTC for 1 BT1 +1 BT2.
After the fork BT1 will become BTC and BT2 the token on the SegWit2x chain.
Note. If you do split your BTC now you will not be able to withdraw any of the token until the fork is done.
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:38:11
They don't let you withdraw until they can asure replay protection. But you can trade them on their plattform. This is just moving balances on their on DB. So, no replay protection needed.
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:42:40
Electrum uses the new bech32 Format. Unfortunatly most Wallets don't recognize it yet. What you can do is make a non SegWit-Wallet with Electrum and send it to this address. Than you can send it to your SegWit-Address. Don't worry. From there you can send it to every Address.
Electrum is just a little bit ahead of all others.

Electrum uses the bech32-adressformat. At the moment most wallets don't recognice it. For now you have to send it to your non-segwit electrum wallet and from there to your new SegWit-wallet.
But from your bech32-wallet you can send to any other adress without a problem. Be it SegWit or not.
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:36:45

I don't know. Their are announcing it. You can withdraw your BTC now. But after the fork nobody can allow withdraw until the coins are tainted with knew minted coins.
If they would allow it: I myself would buy tons of B2x shitcoins, withdraw them and start a replay attack to get BTC. It's easy enough.
Edit: YEAH. ATH.
Edit2: B2X was canceled while I was writing :-)

i don't know why people are still don't getting this.
He meant and wrote whithin the same consensus rules.
When two miners find a block at the same time you have a chainsplit. A group of miners see one block first and mine on top of it and others see the second first and mine on top of this one. We have then two chains. Which one is the valid one? Your quote anwers this question. "The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it"

@_date: 2018-02-05 01:23:32
Again yes. But if a small pool doesn't earn enough it will not survive. The existing "small" pools are therefore big enough to mine enough blocks. Don't forget there are approximately 144 blocks a day to mine. Even if your pool only have 1 % of the hashrate this means nearly $100000 a week
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:37:28
With BT1 they mean the token of the legacy chain aka Bitcoin. So after the fork you can withdraw it and you will get BTC. Only in the extreamly unlikely event, that the legacy Chain dies you get nothing. If 2x dies or not doesn't matter.

No. The fork starts somewhere in the middle of the 2016 Block period.

BTC isn't really vulnerable to Quantum Computers.
But if it were this would be a possibility.
BTC isn't vulnerable because in order to calculate the private key you have to know the real public key and this isn't the BTC-Adress. The real public key is only revealed after a transaction is made. But then the BTC are moved to another Adresses with another public keys.

The fork didn't happend yet. So there is no SegWit2x. What your Ledger shows seams to be the amount you get wenn the fork happens in November.
What you can do now is to send your BTC to Bitfinex and tread them against futures. For each BTC you will get 1 BT1 (representing the token of the legacy chain after the fork happens) and 1 BT2 (representing segwit2x coins after the fork). Then you can sell your BT2 coins.
But until the fork happens you can't withdraw the BT1 coins.
