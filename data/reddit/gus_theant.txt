Not gonna lie that’s the biggest issue for me. 
I’ve known about Bitcoin for a few years, but was never really interested until the start of this semester when a couple of people I have classes with started telling me about it.
Thinking about dipping my feet in the shallow end next paycheck (If that’s how it works? Still learning).

I wish I had gotten in with my friends when we were 16. They’ve only sold a little here and there since 2011.
So they’re sitting pretty right now.

Good man.
Hodl that shit and use it for college or trade school once you graduate. 
Take care of the important stuff like education and a decent place to live before getting a lambo if it works out for you.
It’s important to keep a good amount saved, just like it is with fiat, but most importantly BTC is a currency. With as valuable as it’s getting use it for the important stuff.

Quick edit: This turned into a small novel.


Does that mean comparing the value of $1USD vs how much Bitcoin that's worth, and buying that much Bitcoin?
How exactly do I buy? Is that something I can do on Bitcoin Core? I've installed that and based on the speed it's downloading past transactions it should hopefully be done in the next 24 hours.
Is there a handy dandy trustworthy guide that can walk a first time user through it? I've read through most of the links on the sidebar, and I came [across a page]( that advised just doing $5, but how exactly does the process work?

Noob here as well, I bought a Ledger Nano S. They're easy to use.
Quick question for you more experienced hodlers, whenever I transfer from an exchange to my hardware wallet, do I need to keep it plugged into my computer until the transaction is confirmed?

That's very helpful, thank you very much.
Looking on LocalBitcoins it seems there's a couple people in my area that are selling for cash in person.
How exactly does this work? I'm going to buy a Nano S, so would I take that with me, hand them the physical money, then would they give me some sort of transaction key?
