It doesn't matter what the value of your crypto is until you choose to sell. Just like any investment it will go up and down. Easy in easy out follows the same trend as quick gains quick losses. I am personally in this for the long haul and don't care what the price does today tomorrow or the next day. If it shot up to 100k in the next 24 hours, great, i dont need the money. Everyone says "Only invest what you can afford to lose" with this mentality i can say with 100% certainty that i literally don't care if the price goes up or down for the next 5 years.

This is an unrealistic expectation. $250k because amazon adopts BTC as a payment method... no... 25% increase because of LN when there is a 30% change due to normal correction... no... You're an idiot, this logic is idiotic and your expectations are idiotic.

Yes, this! I've been trying to get my friends to understand this logic. They still speak of altcoin value in terms of its USD value and it gets under my skin.

If you haven't sold already you're a fool. (I want to buy lower)

I wrote an API plugin for Excel to pull the live data feed directly from Kraken during the last pump in 2017. I ran into an issue with refresh rates and the time it took to place/execute orders. On top of this you run into transaction fees. There are bots that can do this for you on gethub and if you can code in python and willing to spend time setting up limits and constantly monitory to make sure its working. IMHO if you dont have extremely low ping to the exchange servers you will lose.
That said, if you are looking to accumulate crypto regardless of fiat value then your theory is valid. I was in the same boat as you when trying to wrap my head around this concept. It just takes a substantial effort to implement.

Should go up as there wont be a split. Its all smoke and mirrors for the small time trader.

Mind blowing, build hype, media takes hold, people hold back and shift funds to alt currency, drop bomb, ride the wave.

Current value of the 16.66 million bit coins in circulation = ~ $1116662000000  @  It would take a lot of fiat cashout to drop the price to $3000/coin.
