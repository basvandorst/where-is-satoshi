It's also a lesson in not getting emotionally involved in investments. From the story, they worked at the company, so they believed in it. They believed in it because they wanted it to succeed. But everyone working at or investing in startups needs to abandon the idea of job security and plan on how short-lived they can be. Even in big corporations (in my field), people in leadership roles never stay in the same position for more than a few years. Three years on a single project is about the maximum.
It's probably a good lesson for crypto investors too. Don't get too emotionally invested in something or you might end up paying the price.

HIV test is prone to false negative when there is a low amount in the blood. It's safer to just not allow high risk people to donate.
