Honest advice: It will not keep going like this. It will crash. It may crash back down to $20k, or it may crash down to $5k, $1k, $100. If the money in your account is enough to change your life, cash out and don't look back. Or set a limit to see your bitcoin at a guaranteed price (stop loss).
Even if it does not crash for awhile, you should assume it will. Put yourself into the shoes of your future self, after a significant correction. Bitcoin is $2k, and you're thinking "If I had only sold at $17,000". That time is now.

Wow. Best of luck to you. I hope it works out for the best.

Do you literally mean you go to Mexico and sell them locally somehow? Or is this all done digitally?
@_date: 2015-01-12 17:47:15
mind explaining? this is new to me.

and how many people do you see rushing in to buy now? caveat emptor. not saying that we need no regulations, but regulations by themselves are no silver bullet.

@_date: 2011-04-12 21:52:15

@_date: 2011-04-12 22:17:02

@_date: 2011-10-18 14:39:04

you mine for bitcoins 2 years ago when you could get like 100/day

nowadays it's easy-ish to get into a credit union. even up to a few years ago, depending on location, it wasn't always convenient or possible to join a credit union (because most have qualifications like live in an area, armed forces, industry, etc). So a bank may be the most convenient option.

Sometimes you see deals where it's higher interest rates on the first $500 or so in an account.
My credit union dropped "dividends" into my account at the end of the year, too. That was awesome. It was based on the average balance of your accounts divided by their profit (as a member you are an owner of the credit union, so we had a share in the 'profits')
