Yeah, they're definitely involved, but the guy's door was busted down and his home search by British agents(of some sort), so I'm not sure how the whole legal interplay there works out.

Does the UK have any equivalent laws to the [good faith exception](
If not, does the US law play into this at all?

I think it probably shifts from one to the other as the directive to report something in a certain way moves down the chain of command.
In other words, Rupert Murdoch might be secretly worried about Bitcoin, and the directive for how to shape the surrounding media narrative ultimately originates somewhere close to the top of the chain of command from someone who's genuinely worried, but by the time it makes it out of the mouths of Fox news anchors, it's just ignorant fear mongering from people who don't understand Bitcoin.

It's like an air conditioning/refrigeration process run in reverse, essentially.

This is such a gross oversimplification.
For one, "You do me a favor and I'll owe you a favor later," is pretty much exactly how that whole indebted to the mob boss thing works, so it's pretty plain to see that such a system can easily be used in highly unscrupulous ways.
For two, the supply of potential "favors" is theoretically unlimited, but the supply of "favor vouchers" is finite. Now, favors produce value (for the person receiving the favor) and the creation of *value* is what we want to maximize. If there are fewer "favor vouchers" being exchanged, then there are fewer favors being done, which means there is less value being created. Since the supply of favor vouchers is finite, the more that are hoarded (i.e. not being exchanged), the lower the overall rate of "favor voucher" exchange will be, the fewer favors will be done overall, and the less new value is produced.

They are not being returned by "an authority" rather, "an authority" is suggesting that the issue here be resolved in a certain way, volunteering the resources to implement said resolution, and then the choice of whether or not to *actually* implement that solution is made *entirely* by miners, not "an authority" which, by the way, is the exact same way the Bitcoin blockchain works.
If the supermajority of Bitcoin hashing power decided, tomorrow, that a certain address should have all its BTC returned to the previous owners, it would go down in the exact same way.
So, it's not VB making a decision about whether or not to do this, it's the miners as a whole making the decision, of whether preserving the integrity of The DAO helps or hinders the health of the Ethereum network as a whole.
Personally, I think the indications mostly point to the conclusion that preserving the integrity of The DAO will have a positive impact on the price of Ether, and thus is the option that miners are most likely to take, but I guess we'll know in 27 days.

Jesus Christ, it's like none of these people actually understand how the seeming immutability of *any* blockchain, is actually just a consequence of aligned incentives between a set of independent actors, each deciding which transactions to consider valid according to their own self-interest.
It really seems like they think the Bitcoin blockchain has somehow transcended control by the same mechanism.

Hey man, I'm not even saying The DAO is designed in such a way as to optimally glean "wisdom" from the "crowd" - I'm just providing a counterargument to your assertion that a "wisdom of the crowds" system can *only* work under one particular set of conditions, that you don't think The DAO provides.

Google "Swarm Intelligence picks superfecta" and get back to us on that.

I'm sorry, but that's not really how the math works - you have to weight your potential reward by the chance of it occurring, otherwise your statement would apply equally to buying lottery tickets, and I'm pretty sure we all know that those are a loss, statistically speaking.
