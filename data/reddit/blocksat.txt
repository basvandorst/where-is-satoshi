If you go here [ you can see each satellite and the frequencies.  We use Ku band for North &amp; South America, Europe, and Africa.  We use C-Band for Asia / Pacific - however, our c-band signal is very strong and can still be used with 60cm antennas.
We are using 1/3 rate turbo coding.  Data rate is about 96kbps after FEC (pre-fec is 3x that).
We do not add any encryption in addition to the existing crypto within bitcoin.  The API is also unencrypted, but a developer may certainly use encryption when sending data and we encourage this.  We provide some example applications ( [ ) that make use of the API and use GPG for encryption.
Our earth stations not only have multiple redundant internet connections, but they are also connected to each other via our satellite network.  So if there are multiple internet failures at one site, it can receive the feed from the other site, and continue uplinking.
We already have Ku coverage throughout most of Europe and we are only using GEO sats at the moment.
We also maintain a community irc channel:   if you would like to have a more interactive conversation to answer some of your questions.

Current bandwidth is actually 96kbps but we have 10kbps currently allocated to sending API data, thus the available bandwidth for bitcoin blocks is currently 86kbps.  In the near future, we will support dynamic bandwidth allocation between blocks and API data.

Probably 2-4 months.  Requires additional ground station antennas that we are working on.

We have looked at StarLink and similar projects.  While we believe these offer exciting possibilities and we may utilize some of these capabilities in the future, we believe there will always be a place for the existing geosync satellite network because of their ideal use for broadcast distribution. The one-to-many nature of satellite broadcast is a perfect platform for distributing bitcoin blocks as it scales from one user to millions of users without increasing any operational overhead for us.
