What is this Linix
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:11:37
Hey, sounds like a fun project. Can it stay open source? Will you provide hosting? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:57:25
Like most other alts? Why specifically bch? It offers nothing compared to litecoin for example.

You are in denial. I'm bullish on bitcoin but of course it can drop 50% in a day! Hell it could even drop to zero!
Edit: I think there are not many 'investments' with bigger risks than crypto.

That was TenX, I don't know if it's the same.

That's not entirely correct, I think the maximum breakdown is 100 decimal points. Requires a fork to change though. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:28:25
Yeah figured that out after a while. Thanks

Hey, don't let the trolls get you down :)

Aren't peoples btc pooled on the exchanges? So maybe 100 people's BTC is stored on a single private key.

You can buy part of bitcoin for like 10$
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:48:19
They keep the private key offline, I think that's the definition of cold storage.

Just debunks the first sentence of the article. FUD

He was trolling/begging. It's on his Twitter.

I gave family members a segwit paper wallet. So far I regret it, it's been hard for them actually seeing the balance. All phone apps show the balance from private key as zero.
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:15:06
Wow that's so awesome of you, thanks! :) 
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:24:54
Wouldn't that just be customizable on your account? Fees, and what exchanges to include?

We'd be seeing movement on the earliest wallets then I guess.

No, I don't think he's alive if it's a single person. If it's a group I think they threw it out.
But anyone's guess :)
