Thank you! :)

Thanks! Unfortunately I can't add those external links because of the policy on External Links which you can read [here](

Good idea, will add that!
Edit: Added :)

Then make an account and go ahead and edit it anyway. Wikipedia pages aren't 'moderated' by any one group of people, they're free for anyone to make VALID edits to.
Edit: Really? This is factually accurate.

That's kinda out of the scope of a Wikipedia article. Encyclopedia articles should contain the information only, and avoid being a guide for anything.
Good idea, but probably best kept to a bitcoin wiki :)

Definitely. The problem currently is that positive comments are exactly what we need in the reception section. Of course, a section on the hearings would need to be balanced.
@_date: 2013-11-24 23:49:41
 possibly?

Good ideas, thanks! Will post these on the talk page later on and see what other editors think.

I think the senate hearings were a good collation of opinions on Bitcoin from people with respectable opinions, and thus serves as a good example of the current reception to them. A paragraph in the reception section would probably be ok, it depends how much coverage it received I guess.

I've hardly seen any trouble on the Bitcoin article in terms of edit-wars beyond what would be expected for such a high-view article, so I'm not sure where this fight is likely to come from.

I'd say the Mining section of Criminal Activities is warranted; the topic has received a lot of coverage for various reasons. The mining is explained on the Protocol of Bitcoin article if that answers your question, though it could probably do with a better/more prominent explanation in this article I agree.

Regardless of how correct he was I don't think that is worth including anyway, I've tweaked that section a little. Thanks :)

I'm about to write a positive reception paragraph, does anyone have any (reliable) articles that they've read which discuss public and/or governmental reception?
@_date: 2013-11-25 00:14:27
Hi! I agree completely, I've been careful to make sure that any comments added from the hearing made sense in their context and weren't passed off as the worldwide view. It was just a great opportunity to have all these reliable and respectable opinions shared, it's really helped with the article. You're right by the way, it is a general article and shouldn't be US centred.
Have you seen the [Bitcoin protocol]( article? It might be what you're looking for :)
Also if you're interested in helping out, check out the [german Bitcoin Wikipedia article]( it seems to be in need of similar help!

Thank you! I'll see if I can get those in the article somewhere now.
Edit: The wired article helped to add neutrality to the Criminal activities section; thanks!
