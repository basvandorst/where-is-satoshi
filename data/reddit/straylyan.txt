Can bitcoin fold? In half? Well yeah I’ve seen it happen a couple of times in the past year already.

Thank CBOE 
You can see the day bitcoin got boring in the graph

$1000 worth of Bitcoin could drop to $10 overnight. $1000 in My bank account will still be worth $1000 though.
Stop acting like bitcoin is already the new established currency.

I have beats, they came with another purchase. I didn’t care for them before, but now I love them. Are they the best? No. But they sound pretty good, are better for travel than equivalent priced sennheiser with foldable ear parts and a nice pouch, they look great, and have survived 27 international flights for work and vacations in an over stuffed backpack.
Hating on beats is trendy. Doesn’t mean it’s deserved.

They had an article in NZ’s  newspaper singing bitcoin cash’s praises as the saviour of doomed bitcoin. Lol, it read like an ad.

CBOE flattening the market.

Mine gave errors during firmware update. Like-6-8 times.
I’m not impressed.
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:06:54
I was trying to convey my original position, and how it wasn't too different from the popular opinion on Reddit of "Beats suck because they're just an overpriced brand". 
I guess it's like Android fanboyism. I've had both. I like both. Apple fanboys love to love iDevices. Android fanboys love to hate Apple fanboys. It's irrational.

Where are you? In my country, it’s more than that in our currency.

Since CBOE, the price of bitcoin has been boring!
I miss the excitement of daily thousand dollar fluctuations.
Now it barely moves.

Only after it was turned into something completely different from what he'd built.
He made a walled garden style program. Nothing gets in without approval and scanning. He was up against Norton which let it all in but scans everything and finds it later. People liked the convenience of that and the visible scan more than being told they can't install something because it's sketchy as fuck and might harm the computer.

Well if you look at the wealthy countries today, the wealthiest pay people to do time consuming tasks like cleaning, food preparation, transportation, repairs, manual labor. This allows them to focus on learning and making more money, further cementing their position. 
Deflationary currencies will exacerbate this trend and create an even faster and vaster divide between the wealthy and the poor.

I just made a comment about my moon. Now for one about beaches. 
A couple of room mates when I was 20 were talking about being 40 and retired on a nice beach with a 20yo girlfriend. That was their life goal. 
They wanted to be powerful and rich. I know one isn't close to that target, but he's happier with himself than I ever expected. He found his beach doing his hobby and trading stocks and currency in Europe. 
The other I don't know, but I think he's a bit of a creep. 
The moral of the story is that goals change, your "beach" may not be a beach, and reality is better than dreams when you're dreaming of someone else's life.

My moon is "fuck you" money. When I have enough to say "fuck you" to anyone I feel like. Not that I want to, but it's a fun way to describe it. 
My friend says he'd be happy with $200k, but I don't think he would make it last a year. I guess some of us shoot for the stars and others just want to jump up to the kerb.
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:18:21
My friend says he doesn’t understand savings because why hold money based on expectations of more later when you can enjoy it now guaranteed. 
I guess that’s why he’s broke on almost twice my salary.

I paid $50 x 2 deposits to my offshore exchange. Going to use an atm in future i think.

I am also concerned about the energy consumption. The 'Mining' aspect could be done in a less environmentally terrible manner. The other side is a concern too. I'm no economist, but I think my point about deflationary vs inflationary currencies is a pretty obvious one we should be looking to mitigate or manage while we still can. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:05:25
Thank you for your intelligent and open minded reply!
I agree, it's looking like an investment assett rather than a currency, but one that can be traded more easily than gold and has a more specific and defined value (eg: want to sell your car? google what you want for it in USD to bitcoin and do the trade with a willing buyer, no banks/money transfer companies required). 
Once someone simplifies it with a mobile app or similar, it's going to really take off. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:23:01
Yes. Basically, it's a currency without borders. When you want to sell online, would you prefer a currency that appreciates in value and is valid anywhere, any time, without banks or other middlemen taking a cut, or would you rather deal in a nation's proprietary currency with the attached middleman fees? 
Aglobal currency is inevitable. Eventually.

I guess it will help people save unless they have excess they don't need to live.

My wife wants to send money to her non technical parents in the Philippines. Bitcoin isn’t user friendly enough for this yet. I believe this is how banks will get their claws into it. Making it user friendly is the key to making it useful.

Thanks, I've heard bits and pieces of this but you've laid it out in simple terms. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:48:42
How do I use one of these? There's one I'm planning to visit soon but I don't know what to expect. Do they take VISA? Do I need to supply a wallet address to transfer the BTC to? I have a Trezor, can I do it with that or do I need another wallet? Does it print a paper wallet? What do I do with that to get the coin in my Trezor?
I'm so noob...
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:18:30
Exactly the point of my post in this sub a minute ago. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 08:42:49
I did too. And I still have faith in bitcoin. But I believe we’re a few years ago at least from another surge in value. Now is a very good time to buy. Ethereum too . In 10 years your $500 might help pay off your mortgage early or buy a new car. Or it might be unsellable.
@_date: 2017-09-13 07:58:56
This seems a bit defensive. I'm not picking on one or the other. We already know what happens when one currency fails, and how it can have a domino effect on other currencies to varying effect.
Has anyone with actual serious global market experience done any models on whether having bitcoin or other cryptocurrency as the single global currency will reduce or increase the risk of fiat style economic collapses, and what effect we should experience?
For instance, would we see governments unable or unwilling to manipulate the economy to reduce the damage and carry a nation through troubled times? 
Would it result in a more extreme capitalist society than we have now? Would the banks make it simple for end users and run bitcoin in a similar fashion to fiat currency?
These are questions that should be asked. If you find them offensive, then you're letting loyalty emotions control your thoughts. That's a weakness you should work on if you're in bitcoin as an investor.

Doesn’t like 4% of accounts hold 98% or bitcoin? My numbers may be off.

lol no they received bitcoin. Hold it until it’s $110 if you want.

I downloaded it in Netflix and watched it on a flight. Of four movies of varying types that I knew nothing about in advance other than the title, banking on bitcoin was by far the best.
One other was a documentary called Barbecue. Another was a fantasy movie I already forget. And the other I gave up in 6 minutes.. But I also forget. 
I would watch more like this.

@_date: 2017-09-02 09:39:56
I get the idea that if you're planning to hold it, you should buy it and move it off the exchange right away, leaving it in the exchange as little as possible. Is that correct?
What would you recommend for a hardware wallet? I'm looking at a few options like:
- a bought one - but I don't know anything about them yet. Or if they're the best reasonable option.
- an external hard drive - I could bitlock it, but then I don't fully trust MS not to be giving master keys to the CIA/FBI
- Paper? Sounds too easy to damage with fire or water, although hard drives aren't much different in that regard. I still don't feel safe, plus it's visible so people immediately know what it is.

Some guy made a post about the history of spikes generating new interest which pushes it further, until smart investors sell and wait, new investors see it taper off and lose interest, price starts to go down, then a significant dip. Low prices generate interest and people start to buy back in, repeating the cycle.

Isn't a trezor just a fancy flash drive with software?

I logged in today to ask about this. If it truly is and always will be limited to 21,000,000 full bitcoins, having even 1 full bitcoin will likely make us millionaires in a not very long time from now. If not, it will still very probably be worth a lot more than today. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 23:48:42
And if that goes through, then Bitcoin's purpose is sold. It's already moving away from what it was intended for, let's not make things worse. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 02:58:18
What I want to know is what does the world  do when the globally dominant currency of bitcoin crashes, or is that supposed to be impossible?
@_date: 2018-03-12 00:00:26
It’s a limited asset which means permanent appreciation which means more people will hold than spend which makes it easier for the rich to accumulate and hoard.

My problem is I don't trust any of the exchanges and have been too lazy to set up a hard wallet airgapped with backups. This weekend's project...
@_date: 2017-09-16 10:44:33
I debated going to an atm and dropping $10k  on it. Today it came back up already. I could have made $2100. Oh well. With yesterday's perspective, I could have lost $10k as well haha.
