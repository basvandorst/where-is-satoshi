How about this: NYS creates a verification/KYC system to keep track of all residents who are interested in buying or selling digital currencies. When any bitcoin related business accepts customers, they reference the NYS register. Kind of like 'Facebook Login'
That way, if any money laundering does happen, we can blame NYS for not doing their due diligence.

Wasn't taxpayer money used to pay for the hours it took to write this 'framework' ?

ELI5: This will set a precedent that the government dictates what a company can or cannot invest in. Pretty scary stuff if you ask me. Reminds me of Bloomberg telling people what they can or can't eat.

when is the government getting involved in business and trade a good news? This is basically the FinCEN rules with an application fee. I guess NY must do anything at all costs to bring in more revenue.

Why don't we do this: price new york out completely.
Some new yorkers/companies may have a significant amount of bitcoins; but if the community never provides them a means to liquidate their coins -- their coins are worthless. Bitcoin sanction new york.

Not at all. This is copy-paste &amp; paraphrased FinCEN guidelines sprinkled with an application fee.

"The Commerce Clause has historically been viewed as both a grant of congressional authority and as a restriction on states’ powers to regulate. The “dormant” Commerce Clause refers to the prohibition, implied in the Commerce Clause, against states passing legislation that discriminates against or excessively burdens interstate commerce."
Yea at end of the day the federal government, when it feels like it, has to say no you're discriminating against bitcoin commerce with excessive regulatory burden. I'm not counting on federal government to do that :x

Some prefer growing organically than giving up significant equity stake to venture capital. But to each is own.

pgp key or it didn't happen. looks like someones journalism career is over

Wrong. FinCEN applies if you are transferring virtual currency. You have to file a SAR when then dollar value of the VC transaction exceeds $2,000. You have to benchmark all transactions in USD regardless.

most technology companies start in a parents basement or garage as they are bootstrapped. The problem here is that now any technology/software company involved in bitcoin has to pay NYS to accept NYS customers from the get-go. ie. pre-revenue stage.
There should be thresholds. License requirements above a certain 'Total Revenue' level.

Yea exactly. How much US taxpayer dollars went to MtGox?
$0 !

You keep bringing up 'thousands of millions in parents basement' -- this is not the issue. the problem is inundating start-ups with red-tape at a pre-revenue stage. if you're holding thousands of millions you're not pre-revenue. This hurts the little guys, not the big ones.
NYS should create their own ID system for NYS residents who want to engage in VC transactions. Like the web-of-trust, but for NYS. This way if anything goes wrong or a customer is financing terrorism, NYS can be held accountable.

You're cherry picking. But yea, that's what statists do.
@_date: 2014-07-17 18:15:13
ie. waiting to see the budget deficit figures, to figure out how to price the license.
@_date: 2014-07-17 14:40:25
Yea that's right, things like MtGox don't happen in regulated/government supervised industries. Just look how good it has worked with spotting Madoff, MFGlobal and the bad actors of 2008 financial crisis.
MtGox died a healthy free-market dictated death.

Not everyone is a sellout. again, each is own.

This frustrates me on multiple levels. I understand the reporting requirements but all this is doing is adding unncessary overhead costs and will only hurt bootstrapped bitcoin start-ups; by significantly reducing their likelihood of success simply by introducing fees and requiring 'mandatory' employees to be operational. This will just pave the way for incumbent financial firms to take over the bitcoin space.
