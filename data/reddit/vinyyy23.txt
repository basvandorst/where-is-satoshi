This doesn't look into btc holdings on exchanges and coinbase wallets right?

Sell.  When you go to the casino and have a big stack of chips in front of you, its still not your money till you go to the cashier and get your money.   
Or, get a tenx card and spend it
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:53:21
So ready for this correction.  Bring it
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:54:54
This is standard practice with coinbase 
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:09:23
I just dont see it hitting something ridiculous as 2.5 mill per coin. That would basically crash every other investment market
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:36:10
100x this!   Was rocking my toddler to sleep.  Missed the show.

I grapple with the same problems everyday! I bought 100 shares of netflix in college for $18/share. I sold at $22 thinking I was amazing.  If i held those shares today would have been $60,000 today.   
I once owned a biotech that gained 10x its value in one year...never sold as I thought it would keep going up.   Sold for barely a profit shortly after ($25,000 non gain). 
Recently, when the china ban was announced, i sold my 1btc at $3,500 thinking it would crash.  When it hit $3000 i debated weather to buy 3btc or wait and see what happens.  Ending up buying back in at $5,000 and only 1btc.    Another $28,000 poof gone.
I feel ya.  I don't know how to move past it.

Sold half my btc at $15,200 for 150% profit, holding the rest to see if it hits $20k before the next big correction.  Feels so good to lock in a huge profit and play with the house money.   
Welcome to the tech bubble 2.0!
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:24:03
You can adopt a dog for like $50.  Must of sold alotttt of bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:15:19
lol so many new weak hands are about to be shaken out
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:41:33
5k in profit, but short term capital gains tax.....so you bought a lamp.  Yay
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:37:35
Your 100% right.  Take profits now, reinvest on the inevitable dip
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:04:07
This is amazing!  I submitted information on the non-profit I work with.  
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:50:37
Bitcoin IRA's are too expensive from what i seen. The only option that works sort of, roll the money to an IRA, buy Gbtc....
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:02:45
Congrats! Smart moves 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:15:31
This.  Also the fact that you may bring unwanted people who may cause harm or do anything to get "free money"
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:37:38
Now, just lock in some profits to ensure your gain!  
@_date: 2018-05-06 13:01:58
First time seeing this LOL
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:41:31
Cant keep the posts and memes up.   Holy shitski

Is owning 2.1 BTC still a club to be a part of??
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:23:15
7000 close...
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:44:53
No one knows where the price is going, thats the truth.  Prepare for a huge rise, prepare for a big fall.  Let's ride the bubble hopefully to $20,000
@_date: 2017-11-26 13:26:23
I member...
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:22:12
lol well done 
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:47:44
When the hell did bitcoin become involved in it???   Damn me for being too old lol
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:44:36
Yea but the early adopter rate of return is completely different than today's rate of return over the next few years.    $1000 to $7000 is completely different then $7,000 to $70,000.    I hope it happens, but unlikely...will take much more time.   Just lucky on timing for the early adopters 
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:00:07
Hmmm for the right amount of money, im sure you can get someone to crack it.  Offer them 10 btc for their troubles lol
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:05:20
Holy shit!  I played runescape back in the day, from 2002 to 2004.   I completely dominated the pvp portion with a clan, PK'd everyone in view on my screen haha.    Congrats on the car man, living the dream!  Please send pics, as it is my dream car as well (with a wife and two kids, it is now a very far off dream lol, but happy with my infitini Q50s) 
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:36:44
Well done kid!  you are lightyears ahead of most people in problem solving and adapting, as well as writing.   You have a bright future ahead of you no doubt!
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:13:53
You made a financial decision that helps you sleep better at night.  Good for you!  Mind the fools who have to argue your already completed decisions 
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:25:49
lol well done
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:51:40
Nibbled at $5800, hopefully thats the near term low
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:10:51
Its the not knowing how far in we are yet.  The masses definitely do not own it, small insignificant money owns it...large institutional money isn't nearly close to it.  
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:09:12
Do whatever helps you sleep better at night.  If your going to worry about debt, pay it off.  If your going to stress more about losing potential upside, stick with BTC.     Its never a bad thing to take a profit!  When your up at the casino, it stilll isn't your money until you cash out
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:47:03
In a perfect world the price is an upwards moving escalator. And people decide to get off when they are comfortable and there is always someone to take your place.     I would love to see this at $25,000 per btc.  But what individuals will be buying it at that price???   Demand needs to keep up in order for the price to keep rising 
@_date: 2018-03-07 02:07:24
This is huge.  I’m a financial planner, this is the crypto gateway

That pizza looks horrendous to every self respecting NYC resident ��

 george costanza confirmed.  First instinct is always wrong
@_date: 2018-03-07 02:08:46
It’s not there yet, but this helps

Hahaha this is the best meme in awhile
@_date: 2018-02-19 20:18:15
Banks with matching paint sold out :/
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:52:16
And why is that 
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:59:46
My goal is 2.1 BTC before the end of the year
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:00:57
Same.  I hate losing the upside and much rather take a bath on the downside.   Stupid me sold my 1 btc at $3400 when the china news broke, should have doubled down.   Never again :(
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:59:56
Is there a club for owning 2.1 coins?
@_date: 2018-07-28 00:15:00
Who is still this dumb to do it?
@_date: 2018-04-14 11:02:55
Get your smelly meats and bitcoin
@_date: 2018-04-12 23:42:45
Bull market here now, price up.  Happy is!
