Thank you for your interest in Coinme and our partnership with Coinstar!
Purchasing Bitcoin through a Coinstar kiosk is the quickest and easiest way to turn your cash into crypto. We offer over 2000 locations across the United States where you can purchase Bitcoin.
Just to clear up a few of the misconceptions in this thread, I'd like to point out that Coinme does charge a service fee of 4%, and does have a built-in spread which equates to an additional 4%. The total is 8% overall markup which is competitive with any Bitcoin ATM nationwide.
As far as our KYC process, we are required to complete KYC for each of our customers. This happens when you create your account to redeem your voucher. We do notify customers of this prior to putting any cash into the kiosk. It is quick and easy and done by taking a photo of the front and back of your license, and a photo of yourself. From there, the system runs a check which takes approximately 5-10 minutes. After KYC approval, you are able to finish the sign-up process and redeem your voucher.
You can find a location near you by visiting [
We also have a dedicated support team that can be reached by phone, chat, or email and is available from 9 AM-7 PM PST. We can be reached at 1-800-944-3405. We'd love to hear from you and answer any questions you may have about our services.

Any digital currency exchange that operates in the US must follow KYC/AML guidelines laid out by OFAC. Our team worked hard to make sure this process is not only simple but incredibly secure. 
@_date: 2019-02-06 19:33:58
The process is actually super simple and our team is working to ensure the process is continually getting better! You should give it a try. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:51:42
We are paving the road for the next generation to fully utilize the tech. That very exciting to hear that my friend!
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:19:04
We don't accept credit cards.
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:51:13
Not every person in this world has a bank account my friend. The number of unbanked people is staggering. We can't exclude these people from Bitcoin...

Our wallet would have to support the top 10 alts and we would have to have a float that is significant to support each of those top ten alts. All I can tell you is that Ethereum is next on roadmap.
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:44:47
Just answering a question! We just want to see more people using bitcoin and other crypto! 
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:35:09
You can send send the funds to your own third party wallet after you fund your Coinme wallet.

Hoping to speak with you soon,

Just our money transmitters license cost about 1 mil. Our 39 machines were an additional cost and the startup costs were additional as well. We have been in business since 2014 and have seen huge increase in regulations as demand has increased. Being in hardware is not cheap and complying to these regulations is not either. We expect regulations to increase over time so be aware.
 If you are interested we are doing a token sale to build out our network. Check out uptoken.org if you are curious.
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:12:30
We do make efforts to sponsor local Bitcoin meetups and invite other Bitcoin startups in the area as well. We are so early in the space that there is so much opportunity in the space for everyone to make it.
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:53:01
Go through KYC, insert cash, then we send Bitcoin to the wallet created at the unit. I would wait until there are less transactions in the mempool though. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:55:43
Since we are licensed in WA it was very expensive (&gt;1mil). With more and more regulations in this industry the barrier of entry for this type of business is getting higher and higher.
@_date: 2019-02-06 19:32:58
Any digital currency exchange that operates in the US must follow KYC/AML guidelines laid out by OFAC so this model would not work in here in the states.
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:10:19
You will put your money in but it may take some time before your wallet is funded
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:45:20
We are at mercy of the Bitcoin network when the mempool is full...
That being said we are looking forward to second layer solutions such as lightening network (coming ~6 months) to speed up transactions! 
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:23:08
Yes we create the wallet. We control the user experience from top to bottom. Most of our users are first time Bitcoin purchasers and have no idea how Bitcoin works. We make it easy for them.
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:34:12
We have an ID scanner
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:11:41
Its on the road map in 2018. We have a private client division that ( that allows you to put Bitcoin and altcoins into an IRA. You can rollover an existing IRA and then use those sweet crypto gains to purchase real estate or for retirement down the line tax free.
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:45:20
Awesome! Which location?
@_date: 2019-01-17 17:32:44
That IS good. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 18:45:17
We do also have a team of Private Client advisors that can help you get more than just bitcoin and send to a non-Coinme wallet. Plus it is a lot faster than using Coinbase. 
@_date: 2019-01-17 17:33:45
The fee is 4% and right now this is at Safeway and Albertson's in WA, CA, IL, and TX.  
Rollout is continuing across the US in the coming weeks and months so be on the lookout!

Verification of identity is required to prevent fraud, money laundering, or criminal activity from being involved with the Coinme service and keeps our customers safe. It also adds an extra layer of security by ensuring no one but you can gain access to your account.  
We do appreciate the feedback though and will pass that along!
@_date: 2019-01-17 17:31:04
Mainstream, here we come!
@_date: 2019-01-17 17:34:25
Yes, there is, Tkronic. The process is super easy however and very quick!
@_date: 2019-01-17 17:31:21
Thanks! We will pass that on to the team!
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:26:37
What city?
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:46:49
We have plans to go international mid 2018. Would love to see some in Amsterdam!
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:35:58
Our ATMs have a flat percentage. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:28:48
Sometime after mid 2018! Looking forward to it!!
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:08:50
That is not how our business model works. For all our units we do all the cash logistics, deployment, licensing, KYC &amp; AML, and build all our own software. With the current state of regulations in this industry the barrier of entry for this type of  business is very high and we expect it to get higher as new regulations roll in. 
From a user experience using our own wallet is better. More than 80% of our customers are new users and are not technical. Given the amount of calls we get a day from people who lost their password it would be a nightmare for us to allow the use of a third party wallet.
Anyway best of luck with your Bitcoin ATM pursuits. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 23:04:02
Free pizza and beer will be there too. Maybe that will ease your mind.
@_date: 2017-10-09 18:43:10
California, Texas, Utah, Kansas and Colorado with more to come.
@_date: 2017-10-09 22:28:03
Pros: Familiar form factor, higher limits, cash to straight to BTC, Accessible to people without a bank account, Instant approval.
@_date: 2017-10-09 23:45:09
Keep in mind that the costs to operate one of these business is very high. The fee covers insurance, rent, cash logistics, licensing, and compliance. Coinme plans to lower the fee once we build out a bigger network but a 10% is inline with the current market.
The pros of an ATM is familiar form factor, higher limits, cash to straight to BTC, accessible to people without a bank account, and instant approval. Also we are seeing most of the users are first first Bitcoin buyers.

Bitcoin's value proposition is in the stability of its protocol and its conservative development that ensures it as a store of value.
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:42:58
10% fee. This fee covers insurance, rent, cash logistics, licensing, and compliance and we hope to lower the fee once we build out a bigger network. Coming up here shortly we will have an ERC20 token (Uptoken.org) that will be given out that is worth 1% of the transaction to the buyer (bought at the market). This token can be used later on for a cheaper transaction fee at the ATMs. 
We plan to roll out 20 ATMs per month.  
@_date: 2017-10-09 23:47:29
Late 2017 or early 2018. East Lancing and Grand Rapids are being considered.
@_date: 2017-10-09 22:47:58
One of our investors Sidney Rice is going to have one in his cafe here in Seattle. I am going to give an introduction to Bitcoin talk and help people set up a wallets once a month and give away 2$ worth of Bitcoin to each of the attendees.
They can also use the ATM there if they want more and also learn about our Bitcoin IRA and 401k services too!

Free pizza and beer will be there too. Maybe that will make you change your mind.
@_date: 2017-10-09 23:12:02
This fee covers insurance, rent, cash logistics, licensing, and compliance and we hope to lower the fee once we build out a bigger network. I believe that if you are a long term holder the fee becomes less of barrier of entry. 
I am with you on lowering the fee. Along with lowering the fee at a future date, we have an ERC20 token (UpToken.org) that will be given to the users of the ATM that can be used later on to purchase Bitcoin with lower the fees. We plan to lower the fee and also implement this rewards system as well.
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:50:26
We also are making a push to do some community building here in Seattle. Come to the Bitcoin Seattle Meetup. 
@_date: 2018-07-09 14:54:21
Thanks for the feedback! It actually does say "Buy and Sell Bitcoin" on the sides of the machine but we are working on updating things all the time and will take this into account.
@_date: 2018-07-09 14:53:20
That looks pretty, doesn't it?
@_date: 2017-10-09 18:50:45
Yes. This is just the first step in building a global Bitcoin ATM network with much more to come!
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:35:07
There are KYC checks. The fees are due to the overhead of the business. Insurance, rent, cash logistics, licensing, and compliance actually cause a lot of overhead. Once we establish a bigger network fees will go down. Also bear in mind the most of our users are first time buyers. An "ATM" is a familiar and user friendly form factor for the end user.
@_date: 2017-10-09 22:35:36
We build all software in house.
@_date: 2017-10-09 22:43:04
We analyse the demographics of the area. Population density has a lot to do with how we make our selection.
@_date: 2017-10-10 00:00:04
We need to update our locations. We actually do have a location around San Jose.
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:54:05
Seattle Bitcoin Meetp :)
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:14:41
Pennsylvania is on the road map. We plan to roll out an around 20 units per month domestically until mid 2018 when we go international. Our main goal to help bank the unbanked.
