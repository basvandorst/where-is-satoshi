Holy shit. You're awesome. Wish I could afford to do something like this...
You should try tipping large amounts outside of though so people who aren't aware will see it. This same tip in an or thread for example would bring a lot of attention to Bitcoin!
edit - oh wow you tipped someone 20 earlier. I would buy you gold but that seems a little silly given the circumstances, so I'll just upvote instead.

There is no specific time, they release more throughout the day. Just keep trying every now and then and you'll get through eventually. The availability seems to be changing by the minute.

I love SealsWithClubs, but I would switch immediately if something like this existed. There is a ton of money to be made here. Lots of US players that want to play but don't because of the difficulties of getting around the government and the worry that their funds will be seized again. Online poker will be legal and widespread in the US again, but it won't happen any time soon. A solid bitcoin poker site could absolutely dominate the market if it hit the web before then.
I'd love to see Seals move in this direction, but am not keeping my hopes up.

I actually have an interview with Fred in about an hour regarding the customer support position. Hope I can help you guys out! 
**edit** - I think it went pretty well for the most part. I was asked what makes me a badass, which, naturally caught me off guard. I think I stammered something about being good with customer satisfaction... apparently I'm not a badass at thinking on my feet during unexpected interview questions!
Anyway, Fred seemed like a good guy. I hope to get the opportunity to work with you both!

If you link your bank account with [Coinbase]( they will automatically convert your money to USD and deposit in your account. And as of yesterday, [I believe it's completely free.](

If you message their customer support about the canceled order they will most likely honor your original purchase and white list you so it doesn't happen again.
As far as running out of bitcoins, I'm sure they're buying as many as they can possibly get their hands on. With many other businesses trying to buy a bunch of coins as well, and the recent increase in publicity, it's not surprising that they can't keep up with demand at the moment. Just keep checking back every hour or two and you'll get an order through.

I just posted [their recent blog post]( in another thread about this issue that might help clear up a few of your questions. Basically their "high risk" algorithm is still being adjusted, and they only have two employees at the moment so are unable to respond to emails as quickly as we'd all like. 
The good news is that they will make things right if you email them about this issue, they're currently hiring people for customer support, and the algorithm is (presumably) gaining enough information that this will cease to be an issue in the near future.

Look into contracts, smart property, and colored coins.
I'd link you to more but I'm on my phone.

They will reply to you eventually and make things right. There are still only two employees and I'm sure they're getting completely swamped with emails these days. They are in the process of hiring customer support people however, so hopefully they'll be more responsive very soon.
They posted [a statement on their blog]( about this issue a few days ago if you're interested in hearing their side of the story.

Huh, from what I've read from others that's not typical.. sorry to hear that!

Where the fuck did you see people selling $10 bitcoins a week ago? Do you mean ~7 months ago?
@_date: 2013-03-01 23:07:39
I just bought [this little portable speaker]( for about $10 less than I could find it for anywhere else. ~25% off is pretty nice. Especially when taking into account that I bought my coins for much less than they're currently worth.

check for info. Basically the bot holds the coins for a recipient until the recipient, in this case hotcarkeys, tells the bot where to send it.
