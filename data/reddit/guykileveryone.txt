A raging clue? 
@_date: 2013-03-25 08:55:39
Yes! The ideal plan would be that merchants don't even need to sign up. You just scan your card and magic of the interwebs converts into into $ and pays the merchant. If you could get it working everywhere VISA is accepted without the merchant even knowing of bitcoins existence, I will pour my entire life savings into bitcoin right now.
This would require a fee to consumers not merchants but I don't think many people would have a problem with that if the fee is fair.
Edit: I know this might be a very different idea to what you have. I do understand your idea and I think it's definitely a winner also!

Four dictionary words is not enough. People generated 100s of 1000s of weak passwords and store the private and public keys. They then have a program watch all these addresses until one receives a transaction in which it will automatically transfer it out.

It just hit it on mtgox.com but now it's down to $29.78

Nope! It's a no-catch system. No requirements except that you be online for 15 minutes. You can even withdraw those coins instantly. And I can increase the player cap at any time :)

That's a positive in my books.  'errrybody likes cakes'

Can you show the math of how you came to the '1 in every 53,130' ?
Also you can still bet lower than 1 BTC. It just means you earn a percentage of the jackpot. So a 0.5 BTC bet will win half the jackpot

We were having issues with the web server. It had to be moved to a new IP and the DNS is taking some time to update. Please try again and let me know if you still have issues.

I bought one with paypal to see what would happen. Didn't get the bitcoin and paypal returned my money. Just what i expected. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:12:36
I think a crash is needed to get people to stop seeing this as an investment
@_date: 2013-03-05 02:27:54
The jackpot is for clearing the entire field yes.
10% of every loss is added to the jackpot. So it will build over time as long as nobody wins it.
It is paid out with the following equation. JackpotTotal*(YourBet/BetMax)
The table max for Minefield is 1btc. So you must wager 1btc for the entire jackpot.
If for example you wager 0.1 BTC you still win 18.8 BTC

I am 100% in if I can get a fair shipping price to Australia :). UPDATE: 2.35 BTC sent! Will send a signed message when I get home in a few hours

In my case he said "Please find tracking find tracking and that's it. No actual tracking  I guess the main reason I did it is because I like to learn about scams and how they operate so I can avoid and even help bring them down sometimes
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:02:31
It hit $100. The media went nuts. Many new people bought bitcoins. The end :) It's not rocket science!
@_date: 2013-02-25 17:19:28
Haha I love this name! It's totally the new name of the game
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:40:39
Thanks. So is the brain wallet phrase added protection on the private key? For example I would have to import the private key and THEN use the brain wallet password. Is that correct?
EDIT: I think I understand it a bit more now. The private key is just a SHA 256 hash of your passphrase and then some other conversion is done to it that I am unsure of right now

Hello. I have recently updated the provably fair system to a very similar one to BitZino. You can check it out here

Minecraft is just an interface to the casino server. It is open to the same vulnerabilities and any online gambling service using a web interface. It's pretty damn hard to hack.
@_date: 2013-02-25 17:06:03
It is! :). Here's an example:

Is this live footage from Cyprus? 
@_date: 2013-03-23 08:28:59
Awesome so if i buy now they will be worth more heaps more in a year i presume?

I'm thinking a formatted iPhone printing directly to an oldschool printer that didn't have WIFI

It is a casino but there is a 'free bitcoin chest' which you can open to get 1 mBTC. You can open the chest every 15 minutes. Gambling is optional and you can withdraw the free coins.
@_date: 2013-03-27 16:45:40
Well I was 100% safe using PayPal so why not? Even with a 0.000001 % chance of getting it it's the right bet
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:25:17
Ok thanks. I could store the link to the address on blockchain.info in a bookmark yes? As that is a view only link I don't have to protect it as much.
EDIT: I also worry about the print fading over time, or losing it. I guess printing on a photo quality paper and laminating might be the best way. And having multiple copies. I would like to hear what other people have done.
@_date: 2013-03-25 19:13:59
I thought that might be the case. Your original idea will still be a huge step forward in bitcoin mainstream adoption and I will be flowing progress closely! I wish all the best for it.
@_date: 2013-03-16 16:48:03
bitvegas.net is a minecraft bitcoin casino you can already join right now!

The last coin will be mined in 2040. Not in 127 years
@_date: 2013-07-15 21:59:58
Yeah just one will be fine thanks. I sent the payment.
@_date: 2013-02-21 10:30:25
1) Agree :). The visual appeal of the casino is one of the least worked on things so far. Been so tied up getting all the programming right for the games.
2) Yes! This is in the works
@_date: 2013-03-27 17:13:00
Wow sounds like I was lucky. Although if that's true I am actually glad PayPal isn't reversing as easily as it used to
@_date: 2013-02-27 03:02:08
I'm thinking of bulk buying codes and selling them on bitvegas
@_date: 2013-03-07 04:12:34
Yeah I plan on making the chest move to a random location every so often soon to counter this. At the moment I just have admins teleporting people a few blocks away if they are standing near it.
@_date: 2013-03-07 03:24:48
Forever probably!

This has been a huge help. Thanks!
I've found  very useful for making sure my brain password is good
EDIT: Ofcourse I didn't type my password into the site, I just tested similar-ish combinations of types of characters and length etc
@_date: 2013-02-21 12:51:20
Thankyou! I will convert this into BitVegas credits if you like.

Yes the payouts are fixed and what other players bet has no effect on the outcome of your own bets. So even of the house peeks at the outcome and bets, it has no effect anything
