I agree (I actually use them to set up alternative flood insurance policies for otherwise un-insurable business interests in what amount to drained sea beds, those fuckers will insure anything for the right price). My point is that the costs would be astronomical and pretty much kill one of the biggest arguments for bitcoin i see being thrown out there, that it is cheaper then other currency transactions.

So what your saying is that all the hype about this being a safer, more secure way of facilitating transactions is b.s.?

Or I'll keep my money and not be broke like the rest of the clowns who bought into this thing at $900 and are now watching one crash after another.

This is correct but only to a point, if your company goes bankrupt your fucked, this is why we have FDIC in the US. The US government understood that for you to have a world leading financial system you needed confidence in that system which comes with not losing money you are just trying to keep safe. There will never be this assurance with bitcoin because no government in the world is going to back this stuff. It would be like Apple providing warranty service to Dell computers.

Its not an asset you can just park in a flippin garage once in a while for maintenance, its a fucking financial exchange and its experiencing the first of many runs.

If I were you I would go ahead and put my whole life savings into this thing then, I mean its going to be huge............................ 
@_date: 2014-02-08 17:23:03
Ahh so then you need regulation, correct? In order to be able to rely on these future currency storage facilities you need a governmental entity that can monitor these new entities as well as offer you some assurances that your money is safe. But I thought this was a global currency? Who will be doing this monitoring and for that matter which government and their respective agency, in their right mind, would do this for a currency that competes on a direct level with their own?

Show me one policy today that covers this, the policy would have to be a customized one and the cost alone would negate the positive aspects of cheaper transactions.

"the USD is backed with "faith in the US government" which is to say backed only by a concept" a concept and a big fucking army, to me that holds a bit of weight as compared to absolutely nothing.
Edit: I appreciate your response disagreeing without trying to insult me, I hope my original post did the same to you.
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:01:55
Where do you normally store these things if not with a storage server?
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:21:35
yeah at the moment I don't understand these things enough to get involved (Buffet always said: don't invest in things you don't understand) but I found it interesting to read about.

Not once in my post did I mention Ponzi scheme? Go look up the difference between a Ponzi and a pyramid scheme you fucking moron, and have fun adding up all your losses from this week dumbshit.
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:59:53
So isn't this a huge downside, I mean at least with hard currency I can keep it buried somewhere (extreme example but point is made) to keep it safe or even at a bank I am insured, if somebody can just hack this to me that seems like a serious flaw. Plus I have read they are really hard to track.

"Now explain to me who is promising anyone payments or services for enrolling other people into the "scheme" with Bitcoin?"
YOU ARE!!!! You and all the other bullshit backers of this crap who are trying to convince the world that its worth a shit, just because your not selling amway products doesn't mean your not selling a product, bullshit is your product and in order for you to make money you need to convince others to "believe" it has unlimited potential when you yourself just told me that illegal transactions are the only real way it has any value whatsoever.
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:26:22
In other words "We loved it when the price was rising through the roof and everyone was throwing up shit that was useless but now that the price is dropping like a rock we are going to edit the shit out of this board, everything's fine, nothing to see here"
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:57:09
Yeah the next time your in philly you can buy yourself a sandwich, awesome. The end result is that this is some futurists pipe dream, not that there is anything wrong with that in thoery as without these pipe dreams alot of shit would never get invented or discovered, the problem comes when the so obviously flawed and destined to fail pipe dream is allowed to outlive its period of common sense and becomes as this one did a vehicle where a few guys are getting rich by convincing a few guys late to the party that they too one day can make millions if only the believe and pay up. Fuck man, I trade in penny stocks and even my worst losers hold more value then this crap, at least at the end of the day I can take my worthless shares after the company goes bankrupt and cash in on some tax deductions. Don't sit here and talk about me being bitter I could give a shit less about the actual price of this crap and what I 'missed" out on, what I do care about is the thousands of ignorant suckers you pumpers are finding to buy this shit before it hits rock bottom, they need to be educated on what the fuck they are being sold here.

Invest??? I thought this was going to be the currency of the future, not an investment but a dawn of a new free market currency era. "media is watching" good, let them see how pathetic this whole experiment is, how its only being held up by speculation and misunderstanding and is a joke that will be a footnote in a history book in 100 years.
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:58:18
Yep keep laughing and counting your losses douche.
@_date: 2013-12-19 14:28:20
Yep attack my self given screen name, that will help your argument.

I see no reason to expect a decrease in volatility, which in turns means I see no reason to expect an increase in the comfort level with the use of bitcoins. 
 "How else do you think that new currencies gain adoption, other than through fiat declarations of governments?" They don't. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:18:26
How does it "store wealth"? Bitcoins have no backing, they store nothing, they are a pyramid scheme of epic proprotions that pays those early in the game from those late, and the only people who are actually seeing wealth out of this are those that sell and exchange bitcoins for other currencies, in other words it doesn't store shit because you can't use them for shit, the hand full of companies using these things are doing it for the novelty, no different then when a local theater holds a can food drive and lets you see a movie for 2 cans (except at least the cans of food are useful) but its not permanent and its not like people are all of a sudden going to start buying a bunch of cans of food so they can use it to buy other crap. This is a joke, its a failed experiment and it is destined to make a couple hundred people rich and losers out thousands more.
Edit: I know it sounds like I didn't respond to your point about not being either a currency or a commodity but this argument is nothing more then bitcoin backers trying to move the goalposts, you are seeing that your initial goal of being a commodity to be used worldwide is no longer viable and thus are trying to say "oh no wait we don't want to be a currency we want to be something different, we are not failing, you just don't understand us" bullshit, its the lack of understanding of basic economic and monetary concepts that have lead to bitcoins rise and fall not the other way around.
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:28:50
They don't really have to round people up just bar the transactions, online gaming which was an industry generating billions from US clients became a ghost here after one simple initiative banning transactions by US based companies, that may happen although i doubt bitcoin will ever get big enough to warrant that.
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:26:17
Yes as exactly that "an underground unit of exchange" and that may not change, but the price at $1000 or even $100 is held up by the anticipation of a world wide legitimate means of use which is not and will never be viable. And as far as zero fees, I sent $5000 to china the other day for $20 and I have the backing of both the bank in the states and the one in China so the fees argument is a hard one to sell seeing as how it costs me almost nothing to send money. Thus if your argument is that it has uses that is true but those uses support its value at a tremendous discount to what it is at today, maybe a $1 a bitcoin.
