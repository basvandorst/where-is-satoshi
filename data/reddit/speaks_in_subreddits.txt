Thanks! Didn't realize there were so many options now.

I'm not the person you're replying to, but when it comes to security the burden is not the same as when we're talking about other subjects. WRT security a "plausible" argument is for all effects as strong as a "backed up" argument.
Generalizations aside: the fact that a paper wallet website's security is contingent on so many factors does in and of itself merit discarding their use. No documented case of a MitM, javascript injection, source code modification or any other *attack* is really necessary... The mere fact that any of these things can occur is reason enough to run a "really offline" wallet generator (something downloaded directly from github or another repository rather then directly from a .com website...)

Thanks. I should have realized this from the beginning.

Android 4.4.2. I just tried checking to see if that's the latest available version of 4.4.x, but couldn't figure it out. 
Anyway, I got this device expecting to put CM on it, but support never materialized for my specific device variant. I've been meaning to flash a stock 5.0 ROM but haven't got around to it...
E: time/date is synced, yes.

Right on. If I'm going to be processing and transmitting ~~some~~ ~~thousands~~ millions of random internet users' validation selfies, I better at least be compensated for it.
But, really, what I meant was that confirmations already take so bloody long. We're going to be waiting forever for the actual Bitcoin transactions if this thing gets embedded into the Bitcoin chain.
Not that it's a bad idea, I just think it should use a dedicated chain.

Doesn't this mean that these proofs-of-identity would be inextricably mixed in with the transaction record? Doesn't this unnecessarily "pollute" the blockchain?

Cryptography works the same way. Risk is never eliminated "completely". I think the fact that 99.999999% is good enough is a key idea that needs to be understood.

C'mon, you and I both know that by default everything we see on reddit always only applies to the US.
Hasn't anyone told you to get a Vanguard fund yet?

Wow, great philosophy and amazing post. And you just helped dispel some major cognitive dissonance that's been bothering me for a long time now. Great way to frame the situation, why didn't I think of this before?

reneur, you have to *earn* that reputation.

Great name for it. And hey, you may have preceded Richard Branson, but he totally 51%ed you.

Hey, you seem very knowledgeable about finances, and I'm not, but I grew up during hyperinflation and can tell you for the past 20 years or so the USD has been just about the stablest measure of currency around. Maybe beaten by others that have nowhere near the global penetration of the USD, but not that much.
Your comments were all great, though, by the way, and I also believe we'll see the day soonish when BTC (or "XBT"...) is a measure of parity used professionally worldwide.

There was a 14-year old asking exactly this question earlier today. This thread was posted in response to that.

Last night I thought it was a good idea to buy some coin. Bought at 1150 (Bitstamp).
Better repressurize my spacesuit.

Bitcoiners must have been much more resourceful back when they were all Silkroaders

I think was talking about nike.bit or dell.bit
