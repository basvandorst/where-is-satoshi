Your electrum wallet doesn't store it, the Bitcoin network does, so it matters not if you are connected when the coins are sent to your wallet address.  The only time you need your software wallet is when you want to spend the balance.

Some say that when you look right you are more likely to be lying than when you look left.
What about when you say something (e.g. "...probably when I wrote it") and then look right, walk right, and ARE Wright?

Why would they sell on bittrex when the price was higher on binance (unless they had insider knowledge)?  
Also, if you look at the 1-minute chart on bittrex it starts moving at 8:58 and peaks at 9:19.  That may be tight for humans to take advantage of, but for a trading bot that is eons.  Yes, you cannot complete the full arbitrage cycle and do a 2nd in that short amount of time, but for those with funds in the right spots when this happened and an arbitrage bot running it happened automatically.  
If you don't think arbitrage was possible, then what caused VIA to spike on bittrex right when the attack on binance was happening?

The decentralized majority - "The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it." ~Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin Whitepaper 2008

Agreed, that makes no sense!  Thin air is freely available nearly everywhere on earth including the top of the mountains and has nothing to do with software programmed difficulty or contrived rarity.  On that note, it's also hilarious when people think that Bitcoin is thin air!

Bcash is not a scam.  Instead, pawning it off as Bitcoin is a scam.  This is because no matter how noble Bitcoin Cash's goals may have been, it lost the right to call itself "Bitcoin" when it implemented a protocol without majority support.
Satoshi's whitepaper page 3:  "The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision making."  
Since Bitcoin Cash forked without majority support (they actually had to tweak the difficulty algorithm to keep the chain going because of lack of support), it forever disqualified itself from being "Bitcoin".  Thus, the appropriate classification is that Bitcoin Cash is an altcoin.  However, to call it a "downright scam" when it had no pre-mine, credited all bitcoin holders fairly, and announced the fork with code beforehand is not accurate.  
The audience of this committee meeting did not have the knowledge to see this subtle difference nor was it explained (to my knowledge), and so saying this to them without clarification was misleading and inappropriate.  
I believe the appropriate action should have been to not bring Bitcoin Cash up to begin with, let alone use it as the poster child of scam coins; and if asked about it to tell them the truth:  That BCash is an altcoin created from Bitcoin by a minority group to address goals/ideals that were more important to them at that moment than waiting for majority support to implement them.

In this specific case anyone who had cash on BitRex (or another exchange that offers VIA) and VIA on Binance could simultaneously sell VIA on Binance at a "premium" and buy VIA on BitRex for "cheap".  
This was probably done mostly by trading bots, which typically don't handle cases where withdrawals are shut down or trades are rolled back.  Further because Binance trades were rolled back they probably lost quite a bit since the "cheap" coins ended up being bought at a premium without the Binance trades going through.  Further, they possibly even risked being falsely flagged as hacker account's since they heavily sold on Binance when the price spiked.
@_date: 2018-03-08 16:23:36
It is BS to claim that the hackers lost on the whole ordeal.  That may be true of the actions caught, but Binance has no idea if what they caught was the entire scope of the hacker's actions.
The whole thing reeks of a pump and dump of VIA to me:
* Step 1:  Accumulate VIA
* Step 2:  Pump the price with other people's money using the hack
* Step 3: Sell VIA at the peak
If they were smart they would have sold on other exchanges in step 3 and/or seemingly unassociated accounts on Binance, both of which would be difficult/impossible for Binance to detect completely with 100% certainty. 
Sure, maybe they lost some on local accounts, but unless they were idiots they likely made a killing elsewhere...

It did affect other exchanges, because arbitrage.  
For example, check out [BitRex]( which spiked from .000279 to .000680 in the hour this happened and is now back below where it started.

Once upon a time there were 50 bitcoins.  And then there were 50 MORE bitcoins, and after a while a guy used 10,000 of them to buy two nummylicious pizzas.  And then there was 25 more bitcoins several times, and then there was a great crash of gox, and then there were 12.5 more bitcoins several times, meanwhiletimes there was a great boom of anti-crash mindstwhile attempted usurpers of bitcoin tried to cash in on what they knew not, followed by a boom-great and-a crash.  And now there is a time that many thought was gone forever wherest bitcoins can be bought for the price of a great white shark or several.  And soon there will only be 6.25 more bitcoins for a time, then 3.125 for times, ...

Wow, it's almost like it was designed that way:

Hi Mark,
Thank you for doing this Q&amp;A.  I'm a creditor and have a few questions that Kobayashi has not addressed in his updates that maybe you can help with:
* What is remaining in the process to get civil rehabilitation approved?
* What chances would you give that this will happen?
* What is your plan if this is approved?
Thanks much,

I have much more positive feelings for BAKKT than for CBOE/CME.  The BIG reason is that contracts are settled in actual bitcoin, unlike CBOE and CME futures which are settled in cash when the contracts expire.  This means that CBOE and CME essentially print bitcoin vouchers, expanding the supply of "bitcoin" available to investors seeking to increasing their exposure to bitcoin.  Compare that to BAKKT where settling a contract means the actual exchange of btc which directly impacts the bitcoin supply.  
The most straightforward example I can think of is that you'd need the closing price of bitcoin times 21 million to  simultaneously settle expired contracts representing 21 million bitcoin on CBOE/CME, whereas you'd need more btc than there are in existence (i.e. it would be impossible/the price would be infinite) to simultaneously settle contracts representing 21 million bitcoin with BAKKT.

Here's some code to get you started:
    /**

     * Then buys the dip of the dip.  
     * Then buys the dip of the dip of the dip.  
     * Then buys the..
     *
     *  amountToBuyEachDipWith Funds to buy each dip with.
     *  dipTargetMultiplier Multiplied by the current price to get the next dip buy price to buy at.  
     *     For example, if you want to buy in after a 20% dip, it would be .8.  
     */
    var buyTheRecursiveDip = function(amountToBuyEachDipWith, dipTargetMultiplier){
      var targetPrice = getCurrentPrice() * dipTargetMultiplier;
      while(targetPrice &gt; getCurrentPrice()){
        hodl();//Important
      }
      buy(amountToBuyEachDipWith);//Dip time, yeah baby!
      buyTheRecursiveDip(amountToBuyEachDipWith, dipTargetMultiplier);
    };//End of buyTheRecursiveDip function

Well, taking out 20% for long-term capital gains tax, that leaves about $15.2k.  If they were patient enough to re-invest half that at $4k, that's 1.9 Bitcoins per bitcoin they had, woot woot!  
However, realistically if someone had that strategy from the beginning it means they have long-term faith in Bitcoin.  In that case, it's much more likely for them to rebuy in at just below $10k, so that would leave them about 0.76 bitcoins if they re-invested half their profits, and the rest likely went towards quitting their job to roll in cash for a while, so now they have little left to buy more and could even be thinking about selling to make ends meet.
