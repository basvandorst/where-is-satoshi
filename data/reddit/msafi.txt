Actually, when large merchants started accepting Bitcoin a while back, people expected the price of Bitcoin to go up. To everyones surprise, prices started going down! 
What some people theorized was that these large merchants are now receiving all these Bitcoins and selling them for fiat right away (because big merchants need everything to be in fiat for their accounting), and that’s what was causing the price to go down.
So if you believe that, and now it is stopping, the price might even go up!

No one has yet cracked the problem of a fully decentralized, efficient cryptocurrency. Ironically, Bitcoin is the most visible perceived failure because it is being used the most

Thanks for the thoughtful response. I agree that we can come up with simpler solutions such as yours. We don’t have to change things up a lot. We just need to position Bitcoin so that it is perceived as being easier to acquire

I’m talking about the perception of the average person. You’re talking about technicality

That’s a good point. Though I’m concerned about mainstream adoption more than investing

Thanks for the suggestions!
I wanted one master key as a brain key and the other two as distributed backup keys.
I plan on using Bitcoin Core with the CLI, so I’ll look into creating a custom P2SH

Electrum is cool but it has some trade offs that I don’t like, like reliance on Electrum servers (which diminishes privacy) or the use of nonstandard seeds.
That’s why I’m trying to figure out a solution using a Bitcoin Core full node.

Clever suggestion, but the reason I wanted 1 key is to be able to commit it its seed to memory. I don’t plan to storing a physical copy of the master key. And the other two keys would be used as distributed back up.
