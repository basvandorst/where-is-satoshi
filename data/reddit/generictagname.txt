The internet was always net neutral and ISPs were mostly following that non-official concept. When ISPs started to do more and more shady things in the late 2000s-early 2010s (throttling bittorent/netflix), the FCC started to ask them to stop and to keep all traffic fair. ISPs kept doing it, so FCC passed an official law in 2015 to stop the shady stuff from ISPs.

That "argument" about "we didn't need net neutrality laws before, so we'll never need them" is really naive. The ISPs got the benefit of the doubt for several years, and since they weren't playing ball, they got forced into it to keep the internet more free. I don't understand how you possibly cannot get that.

Yeah ok, standard encryption is "retardedly unsafe". As opposed to your absolutely unbreakable and unstealable "something" where you store your word seed.

Since it's Bitcoin, it's totally random. Sometimes it gets stuck on a 5 BTC wall and fall back down. Sometimes, it can eat through a 1100 BTC wall in less than a minute (I happened to see that in action at 17250)

You can do that with practically any wallet. Why buy a special extra device?

Ah yes, recovery seeds on a piece of paper. The good old zero authentication factor. Give me a minute while I go hide a few blank checks with my signature on it in a couple of places.

So if someone steals the paper with your seed on it, they can get all your stuff? What's the difference between that and putting my bank account username and password on a piece of paper?

I just find it hilarious that there are so many people here suggesting that the best way to store bitcoins is on an old offline computer running linux, or some hardware wallet, and they think they're geniuses. Nobody will hack your computer, great. Except the part that none of these people seem to even think about how electronics fail ALL THE TIME. Especially if you put your stuff on an "old PC" with a 15 years old hard drive. Hardware wallets will also fail from time to time. Or you can just, you know, lose the thing. Or your house burns down. Or somebody steals it. They can't get the coins, sure, but you can't either.

I don't get why people here are so oblivious to that.
