Nice! Hoping to see you there soon! 
@_date: 2019-03-11 23:13:31
Do you really think Bitcoin will go back to 20k?
@_date: 2019-03-22 22:34:58
.1 here only .9 to go!
@_date: 2017-01-05 13:29:06
Either way I can't buy in at a critical point which is killing me lol

I'm not the one to ask unfortunately. Fees can be reduced if you're willing to wait 5-7 days but coinbase is pretty secure as long as you don't leave your coins on their exchange for very long. (As soon as they come in send them to your wallet)
If you're in the UK Kraken is a good one but for US i'm not aware of any great competitors. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 18:31:15
I've got one at around 20 hours unconfirmed now but my fee is significantly lower so I'm not surprised. You should have gotten yours confirmed by now though with that high of a fee, sorry bud :/

That one lady might have broken her neck too. (I don't know for sure but it doesn't look good)
@_date: 2017-01-05 15:33:21
Or maybe in an hour
@_date: 2017-01-05 12:59:17
Slides are much more fun when you hodl on tight
@_date: 2017-01-11 15:31:02
You'll either be regarded as an idiot or a genius at the end of this. For your sake, I hope it's the latter. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 20:11:27
I believe you can double spend your transaction with a higher fee which will cancel out the first one, this explains it a bit further:

The people freaking out weren't here a month ago haha
@_date: 2017-01-07 14:13:32
Wait a week. And next time try not to get suckered in by the crazies
@_date: 2017-01-08 14:37:24
@_date: 2017-01-05 17:08:19
Probably 5-7 days if you did it through coinbase. I'm unsure of other exchange wait times though.
@_date: 2017-01-07 03:40:03
Waited and bought in at 900. Just sitting back and watching now. 
@_date: 2017-01-05 19:14:51
Those are all very high prices. I'd recommend coinbase if you're in the US as you can get 0.95 right now for around $956. However you'll need to prove your ID and give your bank account information.

I bought at 910 and 880 and 850. Just kinda relaxing now as up or down I'll be hodling for the long run. 
@_date: 2017-01-07 03:38:32
Either buy or hodl if you're not sure. If you sell you're losing your investment for sure, but when hodling at least there's hope
@_date: 2017-01-11 15:30:22
Just bought some more! WEEEE
@_date: 2017-01-06 19:25:49
@_date: 2019-06-07 12:00:21
Buying $10 a day for the next year. Not much compared to some but i can afford it and it's fun
@_date: 2016-09-04 22:48:21
You're a good person 
@_date: 2016-09-25 14:22:00


That's better than the 0 you would have gotten for free on any other day
@_date: 2019-05-14 02:43:47
Just bought 1k of Bitcoin. Hello everyone
@_date: 2018-12-19 19:59:30
I mean.. to be fair they blocked it because your typical charges aren't 5k and it seemed suspicious. Although it's a nuisance they were trying to keep your account safe. I don't love banks either but this isn't exactly a downside of banks cause if someone gets your private key you're not getting your BTC back.
