Oh, I bet you read a lotta Gordon Wood, huh? You read your Gordon Wood and you regurgitate it from a textbook and you think you're wicked awesome doin' that, And how 'bout 'dem apples? And all that Gordon Wood business.

If you look at the rest of his post history its just sad, he hits all the generic alt reich talking points. I feel bad for him, he has some really warped views and its clear hes chosen to blame other people for all the issues in his life, foreigners, feminists etc etc. All full of piss and vinegar.

Amazing, both look suspiciously like this other graph i found 
@_date: 2018-05-02 15:32:26




 Yes that all sounds like it was "directed at the opinion". From the outset you've been nothing but rude and hostile, so I checked your post history and low and behold this is how you handle every conversation on reddit. Are you feeling unhappy with your life ? 
@_date: 2018-05-03 21:39:43
Sad and pathetic.

I was curious so i clicked your profile, you just straight up use all these random capitals in nearly every post and you're very prone to just flipping out and insulting people. And you're a frequent poster to and theres a shock.....
@_date: 2018-05-01 18:01:23
I posted 2 links showing why a person might support the iraq war, your response was a rant with words randomly capitalized. You don't sound very stable, are you having a bad day ? 
@_date: 2018-05-03 22:10:21
Good grief.
@_date: 2018-05-01 15:32:26
Depends on the war. 
@_date: 2018-05-02 15:12:25


lol you have a pretty high opinion of yourself right, you go on a lot of rants in the shower I'm guessing 


Projection much...


I'm not American lol 
@_date: 2018-05-03 06:31:21
I love your growing desperation to find an insult sticking point "Maybe hes insecure about the time he spends playing games". You're a pathetic hostile little man who lashes out at everyone. 
@_date: 2018-05-01 18:40:52
Again, you sound agitated as fuck
@_date: 2018-05-02 15:22:35
I offered you information, you responded by absolutely flying off the handle. Lots of insults, lots of capitalized letters to convey how SUPER IMPORTANT the things you say are. 


"If you was really not bothered you wouldn't be responding" lol

You okay dear?

You're spending £160~ on lunch a month, you're already cycling in you could bring a packed lunch and get that cost way down, just buy some tupperware.

The avocados thing was a reference to repeat frivolous spending, having a gregs coffee + sausage roll on the way into work a few times a week combined with having a shop sandwich for lunch every day, all those minor spending choices over the long term add up to a crazy amount of money.

Why didn't she pay it off 2 years ago, negating their need to restrict her accounts

I prefer to run mine 46 hours 1 week then 36 the next, if you mine 10 hours a day then keep it offline every other friday you can cool it down for 3 straight days which i find really helps keep performance optimal. As for cleaning I find my system responds better to a 26 proof alcohol, preferably some sort of new world sauvignon blanc, but results may vary

It didn't take long for people to start calling it a hoax with crisis actors.

Get a vape friend, it'll help you taper down and you'll still get the stimulant effect without ravaging your lungs. Just get a decent but cost effective kit, don't go for one of those shit E-cig ones, those are awful and i wish they wouldn't sell them because they give people a horrendous impression.

So why didn't she just pay it off then. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:51:02
So she didn't have the money to settle the debt and fled the country?

Learn to cook, there are a lot of videos on youtube. That Chicken breast will cover 2 meals and spices will last many meals. Consider, at the current point in your life, its easier to save money than it is to earn extra. Just cook along to a podcast or youtube video. If you bought your own lunch and stuck that 160 a month into say, a lifetime isa (for a deposit on your first home) you'd have 1920 + 480 (government give 25% bonus up to 1k) per year, thats £2400 per year. And thats literally just from not eating a take out lunch every day.

Thats not nearly enough to capitalize on this astounding opportunity, you need to leverage against your kidneys and possibly eyes, if you really want to make a killing leverage your lungs too.

Yeah its a bit sad i think wikileaks was a good thing when they first appeared, but after a while the leadership of assange just rotted it from within.
@_date: 2018-04-25 19:51:56
Julian Assange is a shady piece of shit (the articles from 2013), its one of the many people who left wikileaks without signing the NDA (and ones who subsequently left after are obviously unable to speak). 
@_date: 2018-04-25 07:17:35
How about when they forced their employees to sign a non disclosure agreement ?
