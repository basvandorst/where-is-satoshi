I think the main problem is really people are making an improper comparison. Yes the international banking system is complex. But I don’t have to personally understand it to be able to use a dollar, get a loan, take out a mortgage, etc. We have professionals for all of that.
So if your argument is basically “bitcoin is less complex than the international banking system” but the actual use of it is more complex than using a dollar, you don’t actually have a good argument.

Yea, and if even the simplest transactions still have crazy transaction fees, what do you think will happen with massive loans?

Exactly. And the real point here is that people understand what they need to to use currency easily. Whether or not I understand fiat currency has nothing to do with my ability to use a dollar, or the fact that I understand it has value. 
Meanwhile, people are scared away from bitcoin because they don’t understand where it’s value lies (beyond its value in dollars, which isn’t helpful to its adoption as an independent currency) and not understanding the block chain, wallets, etc. can actually effect my ability to use bitcoin.

You definitely have a point, and you're generally right that those are obviously very different things, but when people hear "crash" in a financial context they think the stock market crashing. Which doesn't imply that it never recovers.
As we speak, Bitcoin has lost $2,000 today according to my Bloomberg alerts. If that continues, people will call it a crash, and they won't really be wrong, even if it is, as you say, more of a correction.

None of that changes whether you'd lose value though. You could literally say that about the market - "stocks don't crash, they correct" - and you'd be technically right. Isn't going to change what you'd call a sudden loss of something like 20% of value.
I don't think your focus is in the right place. I don't think this person is even talking about a crash due to technical issues. But when you go up $1,000, nearly 10%, in a matter of hours with no identifiable cause, it's hard to argue you aren't in a bubble.
