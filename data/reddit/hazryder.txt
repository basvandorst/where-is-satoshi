Actually that's because the current Silk Road has almost nothing to do with the original apart from its branding, which is pretty much proof that in these situations branding is very vital in generating trust. An extraordinary amount of people continue to use "Silk Road 2" despite the massive security concerns just because of its branding.

You'd hope that anyone seeing the links in this thread would be smart enough not to click them, but just to make sure I've removed the hyperlinks.
