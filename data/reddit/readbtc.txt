It’s not a comparison between victims, the point is to expose the faces of scammers, make other community members to learn from this sad story.
In most scam cases the money is hidden in lands that US can’t access, and most of the time investors who are victims won’t see their money back.
The question is, what should they do, how can we as a community regulate ourself as the government fail to protect us.
