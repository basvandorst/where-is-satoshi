“The best part is they aren't using BitPay or anything! They are directly accepting BTC.” - It’s an advantage that they’re not using any payment processor because they don’t have to pay for transaction fees. It can also lessen the processing time of deposit and withdrawal, which is a good thing for the players. Betcoin™, where I play bitcoin casino games, is also directly sending payouts to their players.

This is a big thing for bitcoin if this is made possible. Google is one of the most powerful and big companies in the world, and if they integrate bitcoin, this could give positive impact to the virtual currency. It can pave the way for better future for bitcoin, the people and businesses benefiting from it, most particularly the bitcoin online casino industry.

That’s good to hear. Surely, customers would rather choose this type of payment system than the other one they have. It’s significantly more convenient compared to any type of payment method, right? This is why most online casinos are integrating bitcoin because they want their customers to experience faster transaction and avoid problem.

We all have our own point of view about bitcoin. But one thing is for sure, whether you believe or not, there are still a lot of people with true faith in bitcoin and they’re going to use it in bitcoin casino, restaurant or anywhere they want. It will continue to skyrocket especially now that big companies like Google are considering integrating it.

Provably fair is basically maintaining a fair gaming system in a bitcoin casino. It is keeping an unbiased or equitable gaming system among players and the system itself. Read more here:

I also enjoy playing in a bitcoin casino--Betcoin™. I’d say I wasn’t really lucky during the first weeks of playing, but I hit a jackpot prize in their lottery game after maybe two months? My winnings were immediately deposited in my bitcoin wallet address. I had so much fun, and I’ll definitely keep playing to win more BTC.
