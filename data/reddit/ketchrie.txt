Have you seen any kind of demonstration from tremor miners? 
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:28:34
Good question.  Gox has custodial control of over a million customer accounts, many of which would have a commitment to use the service if withdrawals had to be functional but limited for a time.  The "under new management" announcement from an existing and trusted bitcoin entity would also stir interest
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:31:48
Sigh, sorry that was mean and I shouldn't take it out on you. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 02:54:22
Dark 08 or whatever your name is.  No one cares.  Go home. You've won. Seriously.  Hooray.  You can stop now. Got get on with your life and stop obsessing over something you have no stake in
@_date: 2014-04-05 19:04:25
Great idea. The big issue these days is that it's very easy to talk about, but hard to implement. You'll often see multisig ideas run by websites, but what we really need is it user friendly local software version

Post sauce?

The code to throttle FCC access on your own website has been published on github. You might yawn now,  but give it a week
@_date: 2014-03-31 18:20:12
I'm not sure rate limiting would work.  What if they just make a new account? 
@_date: 2014-02-26 01:07:33
Hey Roger. I'm one of the guys who is financially ruined because I trusted you and what you said, especially after you started buying Gox BTC. Pm me to fix this
@_date: 2014-02-08 09:20:35
Exactly this.   It would be harder and frankly dumber to try to set up a fractional reserve exchange
@_date: 2014-03-09 19:34:56
This guy had earned himself a place at the censored table
@_date: 2014-05-09 16:07:42
Exactly.

But if it's run by an existing and well established company instead, does their reputation carry over? 
@_date: 2014-02-04 20:17:46
I know OP is just claiming that he's unsatisfied with how his donation was handled, but does he actually have a legal claim here? Or is he just being an udignified instigator because the price has risen significantly since the time of his donation?
@_date: 2014-05-05 19:39:06
I think you underestimate the potentially disruptive features of the blockchain. There are already projects like the dark wallet or darkcoin that let users stay private without trust
@_date: 2014-02-10 20:09:01
Relax.  This is how people spam you in the bitcoin world.  They have to literally send you money
@_date: 2014-05-09 17:17:50
This concept was also done last year at

If this situation pans out and Gox allows full BTC withdraws again... I swear I am going to go back through every single one of those insolvency posts and go NOPE!
@_date: 2014-02-10 20:01:48
Um, no?  I still have BTC on gox and rely on charting sites to trade it.
@_date: 2014-02-26 01:56:04
That's exactly what I'm talking about.  I think you should have another nice chat with Mark and convince him to be responsible for his.
@_date: 2014-01-31 16:04:14
Yeah this guy has no chance whatsoever
@_date: 2014-02-06 21:27:38
Ugh, are we really doing this again? I'm going to need at least 3 independent sources verifying the nature, impact, and legitimacy of this claim, because if it's true it will be China's December all over again :-(
@_date: 2014-04-22 19:48:46
Awww, I donated and got my Satoshi hug. I feel all warm and fuzzy now!  We did a good thing @_date: 2014-02-24 20:01:19
Do people pay you to do this darkwing?  Because if not it's a massive waste of your time.  I can't think of a reason someone could possibly have for spending this much time + effort making bear troll comments on BTC. The only logical explanation is that you truly are interested, but made some bad trades and got screwed,  so now you're hoping to drive the market down and get your cheap btc back.
That's what I hope.  The only alternative is that you truly have no life and are doomed to spend the rest of your days trying to troll a community which you have no investment or stake in.  Which would be a pathetic waste of your time.  Still can't figure out which of these scenarios is more sad.
Either way,  keep doing what you're doing.  No one is going to stop you.
@_date: 2014-05-09 11:23:52
Not sure if you're a troll,  but generally it's considered far more fair to announce the launch of your coin ahead of time and let any interested party mine from the start
@_date: 2013-11-04 15:46:02
If I want to run a bitcoin node, do I simply run bitcoin-qt?     Will it display my ip address to others? 
@_date: 2013-11-03 17:23:27
I'm glad I didn't listen to people like you OP.  I cut the mining scene earlier this year when I realized the tectonic shifts occurring.  It is certainly possible for everyone to lose money mining if there are too many people doing it
@_date: 2013-12-30 22:52:14
Not a good idea. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 14:11:09
Do you use the same or similar password/username anywhere else on the web? Be careful mate! If you ever notice bad charges on your bank from Coinbase, just tell them and they'll shut it down.
@_date: 2013-11-20 06:55:07
It's an online wallet that also lets you buy and sell bitcoin if needed.  There is an address page under the settings tab that lets you see all your bitcoin addresses
@_date: 2013-11-13 21:27:50
So many red flags. Convince me you're not liable to be raided and shut down by the DEA
@_date: 2013-12-17 06:31:21
Well... fuck
@_date: 2013-12-08 01:18:29
Someone willing to buy 10 BTC at $1000 for instance, has either removed their market bid or is now willing to buy lower (at 20 BTC for $500)
Now imagine this happening many times over as people sell. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 00:52:30
True, still stimulates the BTC economy though. When a merchant or organization immediately converts BTC to USD they're still operating through a bitcoin service.  
@_date: 2013-10-18 15:11:03
Coinbase can generally be good for smaller amounts in the ballpark of several thousand dollars. But if you're looking to purchase a million or so then you might have to talk to them directly or go through an exchange.
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:55:16
Is this your brainwallet password?
@_date: 2013-12-30 22:55:53
There are two types of bitcoin holders: those who actually want bitcoin,  and those who don't.  I think you'll find a surprising amount of the former
@_date: 2013-10-27 18:27:37
Nope. That baby will never see the light at the end of the tunnel
@_date: 2013-12-14 21:35:19
The decision of what to mine with is fairly easy these v days. simply take all the money that you were going to spend on a miner and buy bitcoin instead
@_date: 2013-11-13 21:34:21
This doesn't make it legal.  You know you'd be screwed (and your customers would be too) if a prosecutor ever got wind of what you were doing.
@_date: 2013-11-16 21:49:07
A bitcoin wallet that can reliably put a delay on sending coins out, making them hard to pilfer without the owner noticing.  An emergency backup address could also capture the tx before its broadcast. 
Do this, and you have the best hot wallet of them all
@_date: 2013-10-15 14:53:01
it is a truly interesting idea, but we would see the number of submissions to this subreddit plummet
@_date: 2013-12-07 23:29:11
Can you clarify how to do this?  I want to help!

Original owner sold the domain,  New owner posted malware. Use BitListen.com now
Or my fave: needanumbrella.com
@_date: 2013-11-08 00:55:34
perhaps not yet, but it's definitely a start.  it allows Bitcoin Users to easily become political players too
@_date: 2013-11-18 13:02:25
Let me guess... 50btc.com?

Your transactions are not canceled.  This happened to me before by accident and they can re-open your account

Can you elaborate on this?  Sounds interesting

It is absa-fucking-lutely illegal to dispense drugs like this without a doctor's prescription, especially controlled substances. US customers beware.
@_date: 2013-11-02 14:30:50
Bitcoin is an international currency.  The U.S. trying to ban it would be like trying to ban the Swiss Franc or the Chinese Yuan
But more than that,  a "ban" by a single country would mean Bitcoin would just move elsewhere and someone else would benefit from the tech. It's an instrument of financial prosperity and to shun it is to embrace the archaic tools of the past
@_date: 2013-11-17 22:05:46
He's lying. There's no way he's accumulated 480 BTC this year unless its ASIC tech. And there's no way he just happened to check back on his Asicminer just now to see how it's been doing
@_date: 2013-11-08 00:39:29
Interesting caveats, but good god this is huge! Anyone who's been worried that the US was going to "Ban bitcoin" can feel a little weight lifted off their shoulders

The growth of this subreddit is clearly parabolic and unsustainable. Unsubscribe now before it's too late! ;-)

I cannot believe this vitriolic hate piece is noteworthy.  It's reddit, what do you expect?  
Clamor for more moderation all you want, but if you try to heavily restrict what people can post there are huge consequences. People will leave in droves, and now is not the time
@_date: 2013-11-02 14:20:32
Can someone cross post this to bitcointalk? I don't have access to my account there from this device. 
Also,  any reliable backups for paper wallet printing?  
Also...fuck!
