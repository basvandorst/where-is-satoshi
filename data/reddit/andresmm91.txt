This is just to monitor the balance I think! I'm trying it now :D

They are a new company, as pilaf said, they opened in May. I've read about it a few months ago, but never bought anything. Now I think I'm going to try to buy with Bitcoin once they implement it :D

Has anyone tried this yet?

There are a few really great tools I've used before to make simple videogames (and a few friends who had almost any knowledge used them too without any problems!):
- Construct2: 
- GameMaker: 
These tools have a nice editor, so no coding is needed (although you can also edit the code yourself).
Now, for someone who already knows C++ (they should know OOP, functions, etc), this library was the first one my teachers gave us:
It's easy to learn and there's a lot of documentation.
Another good one is PHASER: 
That one is a framework for HTML5 videogames.
Hope this helps!

Well, right now I use a lot of C++ and C# for videogames development. And a lot of PHP when I have to create websites.

I've had a bad experience too. They owe me $110, it's been one week, and nothing.

Thanks!

I'm from Argentina and tried signing up. They make you fill a form with all your information (phone number, address, city, etc). After all that, the site told me it's not available in my area yet.
WTF. They could have a list for available countries, or something like that. Now they have my info, and I've wasted my time with something that doesn't work for me.

Argentina here!

I'm going to register, deposit some BTC and order the plastic card. I will update or make a post when I try it!
Anyone else has received the card or tried the service?

If you don't trust it and you don't want to analyze it, then don't use it. Or create your own..
@_date: 2014-11-20 02:24:02
Hahaha thanks!

I remember using Java maybe 4 or 6 years ago with a few friends, to make an emulated server of Lineage 2! Good times :D

Great work, and thanks for the tips!

I didn't try sending or receiving anything yet, but here are a few things I noticed:
1. When I try to close the app using the back touch button from my phone, it doesn't do anything (I'm using a Sony Xperia Z3). So, basically, I can't close the app.
2. The balance is shown in 'bits' only, it would be nice if the user can choose between BTC, mBTC, and Bits.
3. Once the app generates the recovery phrase, and once I check "I wrote it down", there should be an option to delete it from the phone if the user wants (like Copay). 
The app itself is really nice, clean and the fastest I've tried. I will try to send and receive some bits later and see if everything works!.

For some reason, it won't let me register.
"Password must include at least one special character"
My password includes a letter, a capital letter, numbers and a symbol. What could it be?

Wow that's great what you're doing! :D
