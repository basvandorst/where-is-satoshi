Ha! I know where you're at. I bought/mined some coins very early on, when the price was in the pennies, and put my wallet in a truecrypt container. A LOT of coins. You can imagine my joy when the price went to $10 -&gt; $20 -&gt; $30 about a year later. When the price was in the mid twenties, i decided to sell and realize some of my fantastic gain. That's when the nightmare began. 
i tried my usual password combos to no avail. I sat there for 4 hours trying different passwords. It was a mix of anger, tears, depression, etc. When my wife noticed that i was distraught she asked what was wrong. In anger, i snapped at her: 'nothing!'. She knew very little about this 'bit coin' thing i was into, so she figured i was in 'one of my moods' and left me alone. I didn't even convey the gravity of the situation: how we were just a few stupid characters away from a very large sum of money. Crazy right? Just a few characters away! It's almost absurd to even say it (which is probably why i didn't say anything to her).
Finally, in the wee hours of the morning, i got the password. It totally made sense, though it was an unusual combination of my standard passwords, which is why i didn't get it off the bat. The relief was immense. 
tl;dr; i did the same, but with a very large amount, and wound up figuring out password in the end. good luck to you and keep trying!

lol. my wife still doesn't understand what the hell a bitcoin is. she just knows that bitcoin paid for a lot of things she has now :)
I got a few thousand sold at $31ish (it was pretty close to peak value. felt like master trader for impeccable timing). In the end, my average sell price wound up being in the high teens (i liquidated everything between 12 and 31).
Did you wind up selling yours for a good price?
