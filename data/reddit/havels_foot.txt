This is a great idea, and might be the one thing that will actually get me off of nicotine altogether. I used to Dip then went to smoking, then went back to dip to try to quit smoking. thanks for the amazing idea.

So honest question if you don't mind me asking, how much did you start out with, and how much did you put in regularly? just trying to get an idea of how people are making these huge gains other then buying low and selling high etc. 
just wondering and looking for tips.

So I have a serious question, I have tried to trade and invest (currently holding 1 coin of a few different lower alts and LTC) I mainly have used the little amounts of ETH and BTC I put money into to trade for other alts, but I am still trying to learn how to gain from trading. If you guys have any pointers/tips other then don't FOMO and follow FUD, as well as buy low and sell high. My biggest question is how do I trade into a profit, I thought I had a good idea but have ended up in a lower price point doing it the way I have been. Having a full time job and other responsibilities I have not had a ton of time for youtube videos to watch so have been trying to ask around and have not gotten any advice really. 
I know you guys aren't financial advisors etc. just looking for pointers from people that seem to have profited from trading. Also I have mainly been trading in Binance so would trading on multiple exchanges be a good idea? I ask because checking on coinbase prices and binance prices I see they are differing substantially. I have never reallythought about this, so I just wanted to ask.

I wish I had even that much to use/gain/lose. Can I borrow 1k? �� or maybe some trade tips? I know you don't need a lot to make gains in crypto just going into trading with research alone is depressing/slightly confusing as to what to do when. 
Why the downvotes, I was both asking an honest question and making a joke. calm down y'all.

So may I ask of you sold a full bitcoin? Or just sold at that price what you had. Honestly just curious.
