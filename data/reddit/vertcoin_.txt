lol op is mad that he didn't buy in last week when it was $100 cheaper a coin, now he's buying some time until his money arrives on bitstamp so he can attempt to buy lower. Nice work, really.

Lol you'll eat your shoe in June/July, the 20nm chips from KnC havn't even come out of fab yet. Watch when next gen ASICminer and KNC chips come online, ASICminer alone has about the entire network hashrate right now waiting to come online. So there's at least double the current hashrate coming in a few months, and KnC's Neptunes are coming by July.

If you go to their site it clearly says that they use "p2p technology", so what else other than Bitcoin would that be? They use Bitcoin under the hood.
