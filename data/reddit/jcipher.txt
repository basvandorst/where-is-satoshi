Did you manage to get your private keys?
Not sure about Electrum not opening. If you meant it won't open your existing MultiBit wallet backup, that's normal. If the program won't load on your computer then maybe you installed wrong version or something?

As long as you get the private key, you can import to Electrum.
You should create a wallet that is based on BIP39 mnemonic phrase since most new wallets are using that. Some wallets will allow you to sweep (I think Electrum supports it but video instruction is for importing) the funds from private key to the new wallet. Once you emptied the BTC from old wallets, you can also sweep any forked coins (ex. BCH, BTG, etc.) from the same private keys.

Maybe it's best to backup your MultiBit wallet, reinstall windows, update windows, then figure out the private keys.
 for wallet file location
If you have another pc, maybe copy the wallet files to new pc and try to access the private keys there?

 follow the video and get your private key into Electrum. Then send it off to your current wallet or exchange.
Your old wallet should have some forked bitcoins (eg. BCH, BTG, etc) that you could also claim if you think it's worth your effort. Coinomi can sweep BCH and BTG easily but it's the only method I used so I have no comparison. With Electrum, make it display the private key in QR code, use Coinomi to sweep the coins to their new wallet in Coinomi. Before sweeping for forked coins, make sure that you already spent your BTC by sending it away.
