Correct.  So how?
@_date: 2015-02-11 00:06:04
It is "rooted" -- I unlocked the bootloader, replaced the bootloader with the stock bootloader but only with *my* keys, then deployed a CM image verified and signed by me, then re-locked the bootloader.  No app has root access unless I explicitly confirm it.
The phone bootloader is both stock and locked, and only images signed by myself (not even by Google) are allowed to be flashed by the bootloader.

Thank you very much.  That sounds like an idea worth exploring.  Someone suggested I should logcat the phone while that is taking place earlier, and I'm looking into doing that -- I just don't want thieves to steal from me again, and I don't know how long that type of process will take -- it took 13 days from the moment I bought the coins to the moment they were stolen, so it could be a really long wait.

Titanium Backup, Terminal and Xposed installer (only to (a) install itself, and (b) reboot the system).  Unless these apps have malicious code, then I do not see what other leak there might have been.

I answered this question somewhere else on this post.

I highly doubt this is related to the Mycelium app being pulled from the store.

Mycelium 2.0 generated seed by Mycelium itself.  Installed from Google Play.  How would I go about finding out whether there are RNG weaknesses in my ROM?
@_date: 2015-02-10 23:40:58
That very well may be.  So that means it must be a Play Store app, because that's all my phone has installed to my recollection.
@_date: 2015-02-11 00:56:24
is leaking.
@_date: 2015-02-11 08:11:58
I was on 2G networks and public WiFi.  At no point did I transmit any sensitive wallet information over an unencrypted connection (or any encrypted connection for whatever that's worth).
@_date: 2015-02-11 00:15:12
Yes, through no fault of my own.  If you disagree, may I ask what fault / blame-worthy actions I took, and on what rational basis do you consider them fault / blame-worthy?
@_date: 2015-02-11 08:11:16
What evidence would persuade you otherwise?
@_date: 2015-02-11 00:15:59
I'm leaning towards concluding that the seed of the wallet was generated with a weak RNG.  But I lack evidence yet to decide what happened.  So I made this post to try and see what suggestions people would give me.

I never thought that I could get robbed.  I mean, it's a phone, it never leaves my hands, I don't install random junk on it, I take every security precaution... and still, poof, almost two Bitcoins just vanished one day while I was traveling in Europe.  WTF.
@_date: 2015-02-10 23:32:01
~2 BTC.  The squiggly means "approximate".  The exact amount is: 1.92171383 BTC.  Do you want me to also post a screenshot of the Mycelium transaction history?
@_date: 2015-02-11 02:50:12
Stop lying and disinforming.  This has nothing to do with the Play Store issue.
@_date: 2015-02-11 08:12:23
That'd be tricky to do, but I guess I could do that, if I had the Mycelium source code handy.  It'll just take me a few days.
@_date: 2015-02-11 00:40:08
Thank you.  I knew that the wallet file is not actually stored encrypted -- the PIN is just a UI thing, and is saved in clear text within the wallet file -- but given where in the file system it was stored, I doubted other apps could access it.  Now I know I may have been wrong about that too.
@_date: 2015-02-11 00:09:08
"Thank you" for your sarcastic sympathy, poster of @_date: 2015-02-11 00:33:01
I don't know what to think, really.  I have AppOps active on my phone, apps are forced to request access to whatever resource they want to use... clearly none of my security measures helped.
@_date: 2015-02-11 00:08:13
Good questions.
CM 11, stock locked bootloader, images signed by myself with keys that have never been on a machine connected to any network.  There is a SU app, but no app has blanket access to SU (all sudo access must ask for my authorization every time).
Now that I checked my phone, the only thing that is "unusual" (not from the Play Store) is that I have Xposed installer on the phone, to fulfill certain features that aren't possible with CM11 (NFC always on, for instance).
@_date: 2015-02-11 08:05:31
I never stored any backup phrase.  I back up the phone using rsync.  No cloud services back my phone up.
@_date: 2015-02-11 08:07:54
Nearly all the networks I connected to were public WiFi spots with an authentication step.  However, at no point did I transmit any unencrypted information regarding my wallet via a public WiFi network.  I also explicitly refrained from applying any app updates presented by the phone, or flash system images (which would have failed anyway because my bootloader keys would not have allowed me to apply third-party images).

It makes me deeply sad that, on top of being robbed, I have to watch as I'm shamed and insulted as a "scammer".  I mean, I understand some measure of healthy skepticism, but outright abuse?  What's wrong with you?
To be honest, I was going to ask you "what evidence do you require that would convince you I'm actually looking for help with my theft?", but I just now realized it would be pointless, since it took you exactly zero bits of evidence to accuse me of horrible things, so evidence likely won't work on you -- I'd just be wasting my time.
So, I'll just downvote you and move on.

Android normally creates a different user per app, and makes all files of an app private to the user of the app, with the intent to provide security.  Security that, in this case, may not have been all that useful :-(
