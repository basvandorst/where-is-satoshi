Still need to encourage them not to take steps that will make our lives difficult. Most vulnerable part of our ecosystem is the transition between bitcoin/fiat.

$1350 - Bitcoin

This is a bit more specific.

Simply rolling out a hard fork to recover coins lost in the bowels of gox would essentially be a god tier mass double spend. That would comprehensively annihilate bitcoin's credibility, and therefore it's value would evaporate. 
If you want your coins back, take a baseball bat to Tokyo and go hunting for a certain set of kneecaps.

It's bland and innocuous, which I'm guessing is the point. "Darkcoin" sounded ominous/silly, while "Dash" sounds, well, kinda boring but at least not scary or polarizing.

Pretty sure that Bitstamp is the goto exchange for Europeans? 
@_date: 2013-11-11 16:51:17
So other then this issue, is Gox still unreliable these days in terms of withdrawals?

I thank you for saving me from getting myself in over my head.

The problem is that I keep waffling back and forth and just can't make up my mind.

I don't know what those words mean when you combine them like that.

I personally keep mine in bitcoinqt, with the wallet file backed up to a thumb drive I keep in my safe.
@_date: 2013-11-17 19:39:41
Good thoughts.
@_date: 2013-11-17 19:42:37
I think you may have the right idea. Or maybe 1 btc a week?
@_date: 2013-06-07 12:14:17
I'm new to all this, but how is that not just an arbitrarily drawn line? How do you decide where to place it's starting and ending points?
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:47:35
Oh the lulz.
@_date: 2013-07-23 15:44:30
Well, shit. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 19:41:43
Already doing that with my litecoin farm. Just can't make up my mind as to whether or not buying btc at it's all time high will be a recipe for tears.

Used paypal for some powered risers from buyahash, went through fine.

Except that idiots outnumber smart people a million to one.

Did you mean ~$20/btc, or am I missing something? Looks like btc-e = ~$320 and coinbase = ~$340?
But if you're saying that it might be more trouble then it's worth, I might be inclined to agree.
@_date: 2013-08-27 15:47:25
These downvotes you're getting don't make any cents.

Puppies and donuts?

I thought they had stopped accepting bitcoin? Did they reverse that decision, or am I just smoking too much crack......
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:57:47
Small attempt at humor while expressing my ignorance to the meaning of certain concepts in your statement.
What's a legal investor?
What's a contractual market cap?
@_date: 2013-11-11 17:34:32
Was thinking about buying btc on btc-e and then selling it for usd at coinbase. 
@_date: 2013-08-26 21:26:34
Well played.

Holy shit. Thankyou.

Oh, I gotcha. If the commodity in question is below value "x" then they're literally not allowed to touch it.
And bitcoin just hit $10 billion, so if it stays there (for, what, a quarter?) it will then sufficiently juicy to be given real consideration by wall street types.
Is that right?
@_date: 2013-11-02 03:03:25
Can confirm, also a confused American.
@_date: 2013-11-12 14:35:27
The concern is two fold. I just asked a very similar question the other day, with the only difference that I wanted to sell at coinbase instead of gox.
Apparently the method you use to deposit into btc-e is the first concern, because if you use a wire transfer (if you're American, you have to), you'll lose ~5% to fees. Then those fees will be added to whenever you cash out the coins you've just purchased, because wherever you choose to do that will have their own fees (~1%?). Not saying the fees alone make it impossible, you just come away with less then you think.
The second concern is that gox may or may not actually be a black hole from which your money will never escape. They've had tons of issues and it's still a little too vague for my tastes as to whether or not they'll actually process new withdrawals any time this decade.

I salute you sir.
@_date: 2013-11-17 19:45:02
Sounds about right, but I think I'll just dip my toes in the water at first like zman420 and usrn said and get 1-2 btc a week, then see what happens.
@_date: 2013-12-14 01:32:36
Crack it is then.
