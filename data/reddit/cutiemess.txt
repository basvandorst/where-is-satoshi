Registration on the site is regulated by monitoring your ip address. So let's assume that I'm from the UK but register an account with a US ip through a proxy/VPN, my account will be classed as a US free account and I'll be able to access the US music catalog. BUT once I decide to go premium and pay with a UK debit/credit card, I will be forced to change to the UK music catalog. I know this too clear because I tried to bypass the country restrictions myself. Even though I attempted to log in to my premium account with a US ip, I still get the UK catalog because my account is a "UK account" now.
The only way to keep using the US catalog is to continue paying with my US CC, or by buying a US prepaid credit card.

Oh hey, now a random reply from Quora is representative of the Bitcoin situation in China!

The transaction does not have a change wallet at all. This is misleading. A transaction with change will have at least 2 addresses on the RHS.

This should be on the top. There is no change in the transaction OP stated. big_choed got it all wrong.

I thought you were referring to domestic UK bank transfers. Mt Gox used to have a UK bank account themselves.

This happens when there is change but there is simply no change in this transaction at all. Can't you see that the whole sum of bitcoin is going to only 1 output address? A transaction with change will have at least 2 output addresses.

You can start by sending freedoms.

Isn't reddit already blocked by the Great Firewall of China? How did you even end up here without "翻墙"?
P.S. I'm from the UK but I can read Chinese.

Not that I am against bitcoins, but this is unlikely to happen because this will simply allow people to bypass country restrictions too easily. Copyright laws are the main hindrance here.
As someone who moved from the US to UK, I lost the ability to stream about 1/4 of my starred tracks because I changed to a UK credit card for my subscription. Evidently, Spotify still cares about your country of origin of your payment card to abide with copyright restrictions. With bitcoin this will be impossible to enforce and will naturally invite copyright lawsuits for them.
Grooveshark on the other hand.. might benefit from a little push from us.

Please teach me how, I can't find that option in the funding page.
