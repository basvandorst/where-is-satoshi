There's an old-school Internet protocol called "whois" which can tell you the information about a domain name. There are all sorts of web front-ends for this, you can google to find one. (Or, if you are on a Unix system, just try typing "whois ????.com" on the domain name. )
In this case, blockchain.com was registered in 2011, and while many details are private, the address listed is in Hong Kong and there is an e-mail address that points to memorydealers.com, which is owned by Roger Ver.

Well, for someone sending bitcoin (and presumably not looking to double-spend), you're right. Once you have one confirmation, you can be sure the next confirmations will happen.
But for someone receiving bitcoin, there are double-spending attacks that can cause the block containing the first confirmation to get orphaned on purpose, and a different transaction sending the coins somewhere else to get validated into the blockchain. These attacks tend to require resources and are too expensive to use to get a free cup of coffee. But if you're selling something of significant value using bitcoin, I'd wait for a few confirmations first.

"BT" is assigned to Bhutan, at minimum any exception would have to be approved by whoever sets ISO standards for that country. 
But it's not quite so easy to get everyone to agree to exceptions. Probably what will happen is that XBT will become the ISO standard but the Bhutanese authorities will recognize that "BTC" is informally used for Bitcoin and voluntarily refrain from using it. 
(FWIW, "XBT" is listed in the Wikipedia article but it's not clear to me whether it's been formally added to ISO 4217 yet, I don't think it has, and I'm not about to spend 158 CHF to find out.)

You can send money to a wallet all you want without using the private key at all. But to send money from a wallet you need to use the private key to sign the transaction. That means that whatever software made the transaction for you knows the private key. Do you know how secure that software is? How paranoid are you?
Plus, once that transaction is in the blockchain, anyone can theoretically use the data to try to reverse-engineer the private key. Now even with this additional information, math is still on your side, as long as the key pair you generated was sufficiently random it will take way too long to figure it out. But there have been some wallet generators that have bugs that make them less than totally random, and that increases the chances slightly of cracking an address that has been used.
So, a wallet that has been used to send coins once is slightly less secure, and it gets slightly less secure each time you send coins from it. You can probably reuse wallets many, many times and not have anything bad happen. But the number of bitcoin addresses is so astronomically huge that there is no reason not to just get a new wallet. The cost is practically nothing, and you get back to the same security state you had before, especially for large balance wallets.

You couldn't have put a message in the blockchain asking if they still took BTC? (Or, you know, called them?)

I'm not an accountant, but my understanding of retained earnings is that it is the company's net income minus any distributions to shareholders. In other words, the amount of pure profit that remains on the company's balance sheet at the end of the reporting period.
So, by your logic, if there's a closely held entity that has a NYS bitlicense, all it has to do is pay out all of its earnings to its owners every year. Then, the owners are free to hold it in whatever form they wish. (Perhaps ammo, in case Obama/Cuomo takes all of ours away.... :) )
By doing it this way, all those earnings get taxed on the owner's personal tax returns (meaning the gov't should be happy), and the owners are on the hook for making good on any loss during any tax period. But is this a valid way around the restriction?

Well, they could always file somewhere else and say they invented it. Your public disclosure doesn't prevent them from lying. If your disclosure is found by patent examiners their application will be rejected. But if it isn't, then it will be granted, and someone else with money will have to challenge the foreign patent when the liar comes to them for his licensing fee. 
I found this, can't be bothered to read it right now but it could help you....

@_date: 2014-07-18 01:43:00
We're all thinking about this incorrectly. Don't think like a bitcoiner, think about it like an accountant. 
For instance, let's say you're a business that buys and sells bitcoins from customers. A customer wants to sell some bitcoins, you agree on a price and give him a public key to send the coins to. He sends you the coins, and you cut him a check -- but the check never gets cashed. You try to contact him again, but he doesn't answer his phone, and he's no longer at the address that he gave you.
Is that money yours now? No, it's not yours, you have to carry it on your balance sheet and try to find the guy again. If you can't find him for the requisite amount of time, you must hand it over to the State who "attempts" to find him on your behalf. Ha.

I'm no patent lawyer, but I do know that after an initial public disclosure, the inventor has a year to file in the US. So you may not be out of luck yet. If fact, now that the whole world can read it, maybe you'll find someone to fund you.
 
You might not be able to file in other countries now, though. But fuck'em, they're not as awesome as America anyway.

He has it half right. He understands Bitcoin's value as a decentralized payment system, he just doesn't understand what bitcoin is backed by, or why it is unlikely that it will be supplanted by some other cryptocoin.
Bitcoin is backed by the collective hashing power of the mining network. You don't just generate bitcoins whenever you want to, they either need to be mined or transferred in the blockchain at a significant cost in processing power. 
So, once you understand the math, bitcoin is directly analogous to gold, in that there will only be so much ever in existence, and it takes significant effort to find a stash that has yet to be discovered.

But patents don't compare at all to the bitlicense, because patents have a built-in expiration date. The BitLicense, if enacted, is in force until repealed by further regulations (or laws).

I hope comments on this. Why does it matter where Licensees keep retained earnings? Entities with this license will already have capital requirements assigned (presumably in USD). 
I understand that earnings should be stated in USD, because the IRS wants their cut, and they don't take bitcoin (yet). But shouldn't licensees be free to invest their earnings in USD, BTC, EUR, DOGE, or chocolate bars, just like any other entrepreneur can?

You all probably know this already, but just in case...
There is an ISO standard governing three-letter currency codes, and the prefix "X" is reserved for "supranational" currencies, precious metals, and other constructs that can't fit in a currency code. So if you want to have Bitcoin traded alongside other currencies in big-boy currency markets, it will have to have a abbreviation that starts with "X". Why not "XBT"?

You can sell off a large amount of bitcoins simply by finding a buyer and negotiating a price. For instance, I will buy all 14k for $1 each. Deal? :)

I think that was one of the original rationales for Litecoin in the first place but that hasn't taken hold.

I'm always suspicious when I hear about interest in "Blockchain Technology" instead of "Bitcoin". I think what they are really saying is that they want to make their own altcoin and bypass the Bitcoin blockchain entirely. Just because Bitcoin was first doesn't mean it's entitled to survive.

A block is a collection of transactions that have been successfully verified by a miner on the network. The difficulty of mining is adjusted so that blocks are discovered (on average) every 10 minutes. Since blocks are limited to 1MB, this means that only 1MB worth of transactions can be validated every 10 minutes. The math works out to roughly 3 transactions per second, globally. 
The block limit is built in to the client software running on all the bitcoin nodes.  A particular node can just run different software and decide to mine and/or accept larger blocks, but if the other nodes do not agree they will not accept the block as valid. This is why you see so much talk of "consensus" when it comes to this: raising the block size (or any other major protocol change) simply won't work unless most nodes agree on it.
But since all bitcoin transactions are held in the blockchain forever, increasing the block size will make the total blockchain database grow faster. This may cause a problem down the road if bitcoin adoption grows and the sheer size of the database outstrips the ability to run a node cheaply. There are also some folks who believe that Bitcoin has more utility as a store of value than as a daily currency: they don't see a problem with 3 transactions a second because they don't want to use their bitcoin to buy coffee, they want to use it to move large sums of money cheaply.

Small blocks lead to large fees if there are lots of transactions -- we've seen that in action the last few months.
Larger blocks will lead to lower fees, because fewer transactions have to wait in the mempool. There will be more transactions, of course. But if fees go down far enough, it could lead to less total revenue. That's just math, and it all depends on how much of a "premium" we are currently paying due to the transaction backlog.
Basically, we as a community have to decide if this "fee market" we've been developing is a bug or a feature.

I am thinking of running a full node on Linux. But I am concerned about my computer getting p0wned. How secure is the main bitcoind client? 
@_date: 2017-03-04 16:41:01
To elaborate a bit more, unverified transactions get broadcast by their originators over the p2p network. Miners assemble these unverified transactions into blocks and then attempt to verify them. Miners can use whatever metric they like to decide which transactions to include. Each transaction has a fee embedded in it which goes to whoever successfully mines the block.
If too many transactions are broadcast and they can't all fit into 1MB, then miners presumably will favor the ones with higher transaction fees. This is why you sometimes see posts that say something like "My transaction hasn't been included in a block in 3 hours" -- this probably happened during a high-traffic period, and the transaction fee they included was too low, so it won't get included in a block until traffic dies down a bit.
Larger blocks will reduce this congestion - which also reduces fees. So miners have to decide whether supporting bigger blocks (and stuffing more transactions into a block) is worth it for them over supporting smaller blocks (and getting more in fees for fewer transactions)....

It's 3 transactions per second. Based on 10 minutes = 600 seconds. Transactions can vary in size, too. But this math indicates that a block can hold about ~900~ 1800 transactions. It's all very rough calculations.
The 10 minute difficulty target is written into the protocol and would be very hard to change (because, again, all the nodes would have to agree). Contrast this with Litecoin, which (IIRC) was designed with 1-minute blocks.... (Also compare their prices. Hah!)
(edit: bad at math)

All these cryptocurrencies essentially boil down to public/private key cryptography. Cryptographic signatures made with a private key can be verified with a public key. This can be used to verify an identity: if an signed message appears that is verified by a well-known public key, then it could only have been generated by someone who holds the private key.
Value (BTC/LTC/ETH/etc) is sent to addresses derived from a public key, and can only be spent by using the private key. (I am skipping a *lot* of steps here, particularly for eth!) These public addresses are truly public in that they appear in the blockchain.
The guy must have signed his message with a private key associated with the "event", and people can use the associated public key to verify it. It could only have come from someone who controls the key that can spend some of the ETH that was "legally appropriated"...

It seems to me that someone could make a lot of money by selling bitcoins to these people along with an "insurance" policy that guarantees to buy back the bitcoins at a set price.

I bought a little bit of bitcoin over the summer, then (like an idiot) spent most of that coin to buy block eruptors. 
If I had just held onto the coins, figuring out the tax implications would be simple. But now I have coins I have purchased and coins I have mined, so I need to figure those out separately, I guess?
