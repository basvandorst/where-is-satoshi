Trying to explain mining to most people goes way over their heads. Perfect picture.

Google recently added a new way to send money online via Google Wallet. With my CC attached, it's a 2.9% transfer fee (Minimum $0.30). They say to link a bank account to skip the fees.
I haven't actually tried this service. No need for me due to bitcoin.

I agree, but good luck all! It's already happening.

How do I pay taxes on every transaction under $600? Add it all up and put it somewhere on my 1040 or 1099?

It's been a while since I've used my Paypal account (before getting involved with Bitcoin). I recently had to transfer some funds from my bank to Paypal to make a purchase on eBay. 
It takes 3-5 days for the funds to be available to use with Paypal... I already see the funds have cleared in my bank account, $0 balance in Paypal. 
After Bitcoin, Paypal seems archaic and slow. It can't stand a chance when Bitcoin goes mainstream.

I did this for a bit, but a lot of people do this and you still don't get a good ROI. I got tired of constantly switching coins and registering at new pools and decided to leave them on eligius 24/7. If it nets me .3 btc in it's lifetime, I'll be happy.
@_date: 2014-04-07 07:25:36
I agree 100%. It's all about infrastructure. There needs to be a BTC swipe card merchant.

I can see where you are coming from. Doge has gotten a lot of success to be proud of - the notable donations, the number of subreddit subscribers, and the value has been going up too. I think it's mostly from a lot of new people just getting into cryptos. They have no other coin to cheer for. Hell, most barely know how to setup and backup their wallets.
I, for one, don't know why there is all this animosity. We are fighting the same battle. I invest heavily in a number of coins, each with their advantages and disadvantages. I believe that the real doge holders know that bitcoin fought (and still fighting) a much harder fight that paved the way.
@_date: 2014-03-23 05:01:28
Logo yes, coin no. 
Hearing what friends and family see about bitcoins from the general media makes me cringe. Fortunately, they know who to ask the real questions to.

I downloaded Mycelium for the first time today. This video was front and center.
It was pretty off putting. Made me feel like it was the candy crush of wallets. But, I've always heard good things about Mycelium and got my first mobile wallet going anyway.

Very good point. Definitely something we have to keep in mind.

That doesn't seem too secure. Do they provide other options to get your private keys?

Congratulations r/bitcoin! Big milestone.
Great to see so much crypto currency support on reddit

April 15th is US tax return deadline. With the recent IRS tax regulation announcements, we'll see how strictly these regulations are enforced. 
If they come down hard on bitcoin users, a lot will sell off their coins. If the regulations work well, a lot of new money will start coming in.

First half of the video is more or less explaining what Bitcoin is beyond what you see in the total beginner youtube videos, global ledgers etc and stuff you already know (Gavin did a great job!). Pierce makes (the correct) comparison of bitcoin and the blockchain to tcp and http, ssh, ftp, etc in internet protocols. He then goes into how the blockchain can be used for other purposes that have nothing to do with finances. 
First concept was Madesafe (Maidsafe?). A decentralized Dropbox/storage. You provide storage space, you earn coins. You use disk space, you pay coins.
Second was Meshcoin. You share your wireless bandwidth, you earn coin. If you use this decentralized wireless bandwidth, you pay coins.

Their withdrawals are in limbo right now. Keep an eye on the headlines for when it is back up. As soon as you see withdrawals is open again, you should send them to a different wallet.

BTC Devs had an almost immediate fix. Bitstamp and BTC-e fixed the "issues" within 24 hours after. Other exchanges claim they were never effected. Why is it taking Gox almost a week?

(Never worked in the food industry, but have lots of friends that do)
It's because a waitor or waitress waits on YOU! It is supposed be a customized experience. The grocery store clerk isn't helping you out deciding what to buy for dinner tonight. The grocery store clerk isn't  recommending what to have for breakfast. 
You're some random guy on the internet, but I'd hate be at the same table with you in a restaurant . If you get good service, tip accordingly!

If you install an app like coinbase on your phone, it will not work unless you give it access. That is what the API does. It gives all your devices access to make buys and sells.
