The issue was already opened long time ago:

Mistakes happen, although I did all by the book, but it’s bad technical implementation if there’s lots of reports for the same issue and bad support that does not want to solve them. Now when you know you’re left alone if something goes wrong do you still want to use their services, as I don’t?!

Yes they are, what can be read from my post. This is another part of our communication: 
"...Mistakes require developers to step in and are very resource-intensive. That's why we cannot help you in this situation.".
They have never said there's nothing they can do. If you do a wrong order on a webshop, even though it's your mistake, good support will help you out and not to tell you it's your fault. And I have done nothing wrong, but something wrong happened with Breadwallet, but whoever's fault this is Kraken has the private key. And it's not gone - it's retrievable.

I disagree. They are able to help but refuse to. If they have lots of these requests, as they say they do, they should do something by that question.

Thanks, but still some kind of support from the exchange side should be provided if their service is used.

It was after Aug 1, Breadwallet was used to withdraw BCH (advanced &gt; withdraw bch). It asked for a BTC amount (although I knew it said to withdraw the entire amount, this is where I could see that something will go wrong). I’m 110% sure I went to bch withdraw.
