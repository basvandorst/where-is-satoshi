Bitcoin's way is _adaptation to environment_. Their race is Terran.
- Too cold? Make clothes. 
- Too scared? Build a fortress.
- Hungry? Grow crops, hunt more game.
Altcoins' way is _mutation_. Their race is Zerg.
- Too cold? Mutate for thicker fur and faster metabolism. 
- Too scared? Grow fangs, mutate for camouflage, heightened senses.
- Hungry? Mutate hibernation, more efficient intestines, consume earth or rocks.

Only two things.
First, it's the slow and expensive blockchain - the layer 1 - that will ultimately lead to BTC's demise. Unfortunately I don't see this getting fixed anytime soon.
Lightning Network is an okay solution, but you still have to deal with putting coins in and out of the channel, and this is where high fees will strike you.
If the solution is for people to never deal with the blockchain at all, and keep their money on open channels  - think again. What's the first thing that you explain to newcomers? How to keep their wallets safe. How to store keys on a safe place, protect it with a password, etc. Now think about adding this another layer of immense  complexity. It's like an extra Internet layer on it's own. Channels, capacities, keys... And still you haven't eliminated fees. 
Not to mention that LN will lead to centralization of the coin. Google, Facebook, and few large banks will keep a network of nodes, and everyone will use these nodes to send payments. Regular people would be barred from running their own nodes, simply because of the lack of funds, or because a regular Joe cannot be made KYC/AML compliant like a big corporation. This is game over for privacy.
Which brings us to the second problem: the chronic lack of privacy and fungibility. Owning Bitcoins on a public blockchain, or on LN where many hops of third parties can snoop on your personal finances, it *waaaay* worse than the current fiat banking. Not only IRS but the whole world can track your Bitcoins down to the very last Satoshi. The whole world (including your enemies) know exactly how much BTC you own. The whole world (including your enemies) know in which venue you spent this 0.045 BTC, and where this venue moved your money to. The whole world (including your enemies) know when and where you changed your 0.149 BTC to USD. The whole world (including your worst enemies who keep tabs) know that you sent your 1.095 BTCs to a mixer, probably wanting to spend them on something illegal.
This level of negative transparency is unprecedented. If Bitcoin ever becomes a world currency, it's going to be a very, **very** dark world.

The time to get rich on Bitcoin is over.
States will move on to legalize it and tax it dearly. All the profits will be lost in taxes.
Utility use of Bitcoin or any other crypto is in infant stages, and by the time it reaches 20% of mainstream the taxes will make it impractical. Darknets and criminal circles might continue using it for their purposes but that isn't going to increase the price in any way, thought it might impose additional problems such as possessing an anonymous crypto would be equal possessing illegal substances.
Good luck to you guys, and have fun with the profits. The party for us newcomers ended in December. Bitcoin isn't going to change the world, end of story.

Invest $100M in Bcash marketing and merchant adoption.
Watch Bcash grow to 0.5 BTC and BTC drop below $10k.
Invest another $100M in Bcash development, implement mandatory privacy, fungibility, untraceability, instant transfers, zero fees, infinite scalability. Make Roger Ver it's CEO.
Watch Bcash grow to $16k and BTC droping to  on CMC, price around $2k.
Invest $199M into BTC, now you have around 100k BTC, bought at $2k each.
Invest the remaining $1M into fabricating a sex scandal involving Rodger Ver, several underage girls, eight pounds of cocaine, and a couple of dogs.
You sit back and watch enraged people dumping their Bcash en masse. Bitcoin is  again, price surges to $35k, Bcash drops to  on CMC.

By that time your body would become more valuable than your net worth, so you sell yourself to a meat farm for 350 Satoshi so that your kids can afford 7 more days of food, because their mind cloud upload in a black clinic isn't due for a month, and Bitcoins are banned anyway.

Go to any blockchain explorer, paste any address in the search field. You can paste one of your addresses or transaction IDs. Then follow inputs and outputs and see how deep the rabbit hole goes.
Every single Bitcoin has a fully transparent history. From the very first block created by the first miner (Satoshi himself) down to the last one produced by a Chinese mining farm. Every coin tells it's own story. Like every dollar bill has a serial number, every Bitcoin tx and address balance can be fully tracked by anyone.
You can use mixers to shuffle your Bitcoins, but it isn't cheap, and you have to trust the mixers that they don't keep any records.
Imagine you bought a car from a friend for 0.5 BTC. Although you don't know this, he used that money to buy explosives on a darknet market. You get arrested because your address is 2nd in line, and law enforcement couldn't link your friend's Bitcoin address to a name. So they suspected that you tried to cover your tracks by moving money to another wallet. After a lengthy investigation and spending couple of weeks in jail, you are eventually set free, but this investigation remains in your record forever, and makes it harder for you finding a new job or moving to another state.
With Monero every transaction is private by design, so without possessing private keys it is impossible for a third party to tell where your coins came from, or where you spent them. If you're obliged to disclose your transactions to someone (e.g. IRS), it is purely in your discretion to hand them over view-keys and prove your transaction history.

Most secure, but most centralized. 51%+ of the hashrate comes from big mining farms, who are run by - you guessed it - the people in power, who get to decide the fate of BTC. They also get the most profit from Bitcoin.

Is it because everyone's using it? Everyone is using fiat.
Is it because it has a ground-breaking tech? There are other coins having far better tech and roadmap.
Is it because you can send tips with it, pay coffee, or pay your worker by hour and have it settled on their accounts instantly? Nope. You can't do that with Bitcoin. Fees are way higher than bank transfers.
Is it because it's valued at $15.000? This valuation is only based on rumors and empty promises, and people are waking up now.
Is it because you can make huge profits from it? The time for huge Bitcoin profits is over. Whoever bought in 2015 or 2016 or earlier made himself rich. I'd be happy if Bitcoin remains above $5.000 by the end of 2019. There are coins that offer far bigger profits than Bitcoin.
Is it because it has the biggest market share? Nope, it's down to 33% of the whole market cap. Bitcoin is only months away from becoming an extremely overpriced altcoin.

At the root of the idea of money there's a promise that you can be happy somewhere, in some undefined future, if you have this money. This is how the world works right now.
You can do three things to destroy money:
- __Make people do not want money__: true communist society, cashless meritocracy like Star Trek world, good basic income, good social safety net, etc. Money becomes irrelevant.
- __Give people the ability to be happy all the time__: meditation/spiritual enlightenment, promise of afterlife with 40 virgins and rainbow Lambos, extreme life coaching, lobotomy, etc. People won't discuss money and won't try to get rich because their happiness is coming from the inside, from the core of their being. Money becomes irrelevant.
- __Show people that this imaginary future might never come__: post-apocalypse scenarios, government downfall, serious illness leading to premature death, etc. If this imaginary future is gone, people will start living the life they want, right now, regardless of the consequences. Money becomes irrelevant.
So, to remove rich man's bodyguards I would need to give them a passport for one of Galactic Federation's planets, bring them an angel to explain how life and death work (there's no such thing as free karma), or to give them pancreatic cancer with 2 more weeks to live.

Segway, plane, the pilot, the hanger, the island, and all the house servants are just people or built by the people.
Basically, rich people have a way of making other people do or create things for them. Quite remarkable, don't you think?
They did that by giving people some printed pieces of paper in exchange. Nowdays it's making the computers of other people show some messages that weren't shown before, something about numbers. When people see that number, they go crazy and do whatever you want from them.
However what people don't realize is, that the thing they want to do is not tied to these messages on screens. They only need to stop doing whatever they are doing for the rich guys, make one big meeting and decide to throw the rich into a bottomless pit or make steaks out of them.
Afterwards, the people would be able to do whatever they want, not just what the rich tell them.

My rich guy would wait for BTC to reach 40-50k$ somewhere in late 2018, just before the crash or government forfeiture, then sell off his 5000 BTC which would equate to around 150-200M$ of fiat. That's a formidable amount which he'd use to support his life and family, and possibly buy more BTC once it has recovered from the crash.
I don't see how Bitcoin or any similar crypto can ever have adoption of a fiat currency. It can be forbidden or criminalized, or the governments can destroy large amounts of it by seizing exchange wallets. Regular people don't have the power to do anything about it, other than starting a civil war, which would end badly.
Even if it somehow reaches full adoption, I'm afraid that there will be invented mechanisms to reinstate the debt based wealth. For example: reintroducing fiat tied to BTC, then as BTC reaches unattainable price the fiat will be disconnected from it, like in the Nixon shock scenario.

Let's make a list of valuable things through history and their resilience to catastrophes.
1) Most solid currency of all times and ages, value not affected by anything:
- Strong shelter
- Men willing to fight and/or die for your cause
- Important information
2) Little less solid currencies, safe with most catastrophes:
- Clean water
- Food and medicine
- Ammunition and explosives
- Armors, shields, swords and firearms
- Armored vehicles and tanks
- Gold, silver
3) Kinda unstable currencies, affected by solar flares and catastrophes:
- Fiat (USD, EUR, GBP, etc)
- Government bonds
- Company stocks
4) Unstable, affected by anything from a solar flare to fake news:
- Crypto coins
- Rare novelty items (stamps, historical metal coins, medals, etc.)
- Fees and profits in Ponzi schemes

I think the analogy with a path is most helpful. When we have ascended, climbed up the mountain of years and experience, time stops manifesting like a series of present events. but as a landscape that we see from the top. It's like watching the highway from a car driver perspective versus from a high-attitude airplane.
Unfortunately we are mostly ignorant of the passage of time, and what change it brings to our lives. Why this ignorance comes is because of our ground perspective, because the change is so gradual that we can hardly notice it, and also because we also change and evolve with the system. It's hard to keep your understanding flowing with an ever-changing system. Life is a ride on the Interstate road and truly scarce resources are flowers and things lying on ground. As you drive by they become further and further away, soon they are off the the horizon. Then again, it's not practical to hoard assets, because there's only so much that can fit in the trunk of your car.
Some assets like: Bitcoin, rare postage stamps, 1970s muscle cars, can only become more expensive with time because they are scarce by nature. Fiat money is artificially scarce, not truly. As you said, once you isolate a system (by laws) you ramp entropy, introduce artificial scarcity and also artificial wealth distribution. 
Why Bitcoin rises in value? Because it's a true scarce resource inserted into a virtually unlimited supply of fiat currency. **Bitcoin scales with the available physical resources, it's value grows naturally with the arrow of time.** USD scales unnaturally, controlled by a centralized interest group to artificially keep wealth distributed unevenly and to keep people's power in check by poverty.
Unfortunately, our viewpoint on this subject is ground-based, as we can't see time as a landscape but as a dangerous and unknown road. This is how the smarter 1% of the civilization manages to rule over us: by learning and using the long processes and high viewpoint unknown to everyday folk. Think of capitalism as a sea. You see crisis tsunamis, investment foam, stock bubbles, broker whales, IRS/AML fishing ships, but these aren't individual things by themselves. They didn't emerge on their own. These features are all continuous output of a tuned system. But you can see that only when you climb the mountain and present-past-future becomes a landscape.
I'd be really happy if Bitcoin helps people to see this world with a new pair of eyes!

There's something that's been bugging me for a long time now.
Imagine a regular dude, he's conservative, he lives in a house with mortgage, owns a car, works a stable uptown job (librarian, restaurant manager, etc). He has a wife and a few kids. Basically, Homer Simpson.
In the year 2012 he doesn't have any interest in Bitcoin.
Fast forward to 2020. His kids have moved out, he still lives in the same house with his wife. He still isn't interested in Bitcoins. Still have the same job.
My question is: will this dude's life change for the better or for the worse, in case BTC is massively adopted?
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:04:25
People used gold for millennia as a currency. For example: the gold inflation that happened in 1500s when the Spanish were bringing ships full of looted gold from South America. It caused economic shocks in Europe. Suddenly, huge amounts of cheap gold! Prices of everything else skyrocketed for couple of decades.
Bitcoin is a much better currency than gold because it doesn't have weight and is easily transported everywhere. And you're right, I think some other coins might take over BTC. LTC is cheaper, and it's mostly used for transactions, while BTC right now is for long-term savings.
In near future we could see LTC replaced with IOTA or some other innovative coin which has zero fees and instant transfers.
And BTC could be replaced with XMR / Monero, which is private and fungible. You wouldn't want everyone to know how much you have on your private savings account, and where that money came from, right? I believe XMR will take over Bitcoin in a few years.

I did say 'most altcoins', so I believe at least 5-10 coins would survive a century, Bitcoin included. There are many unique and interesting altcoins that have a real-life use or perform something better than BTC. However there are many practically useless coins that are just BTC or ERC20 clones with a different name and a slightly altered parameters (block time, halving periods,...) that try to target a specific niche market but bring no new functionality or performance improvements compared to BTC+LN. Not that I have anything against them, just see it as a waste of developer time that could better be spend in contributing coins that have a practical use.

If everyone uses BTC, there would be zero privacy. Anyone could track anyone else's incomes and spending. We already have social networks which would help to tag a certain address with a person. Boom! Abduction rates skyrocketing. This is a nightmare scenario, and it's why paper fiat and brick &amp; mortar banks were invented in the first place. Back in the middle ages, everyone had Gold Coins(tm), and it was very difficult to hide them in large quantities. Are we coming back to that again?

Once you close the channel, yes. But you won't close the channel until you walk out of the venue, either satisfied with the service (channel closed, merchant gets the BTC) or unhappy with it (channel closed, merchant refunds the BTC).

It's a test of our human nature. Of course we cannot make redistribution because it's how our minds work right now. We're hard-wired to accumulate, compete, and dominate over others.
Likewise the invention of electricity was a test: should we install power meters at every house and bill people for power, or should we distribute it to everyone for free? Eventually we failed that too, by making electric power a scarce commodity, whereas it can be generated in enough quantity for everyone (fusion, renewables, etc).
A good idea would be to make governments impose a wealth cap per capita, so a single person cannot ever become richer than a gross total wealth per capita. It would make Mark Zuckerberg and Koch brothers situations impossible. People would work in their hard sweat until they reach close the cap, then retire in their 30s or 40s and concentrate on things like science, art, or raising a good family: the things which make whole humanity better.

Because it's very hard to calculate SHA-256 hashes by hand, those poor souls would need hundreds of thousands of years to mine a single block containing 6.66 Demoncoins. Every million years there will be a halving.
Once all 666 coins are mined, the souls can go to purgatory. :D

In a way, I was thinking about both. Fiat currencies are very unequally distributed, and if Bitcoin ever gains adoption, the early adopters will also have an enormous advantage. It will be like the DotCom boom, when people were selling domains for millions of dollars.
At some point governments will forbid use of private coins (Monero, Zcash, etc) and allow only fully transparent blockchains to be used for national exchange. With full transparency, tax evasion is near impossible.

They aren't for single use, they are bills like every other fiat bill. People can exchange them for goods and services for as long as they want (until they're damaged or worn out), until they liquidate them at a state office or a bank, where they are shredded and their value transferred to the holder's account (the one bringing the bills).
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:54:45
The house buyer can check the validity of the bills with a public government database.
There would be a safety period, let's say 7 days from the moment you want to liquidate your bills to the moment when government transfers funds to your account. Owners of bills would have an app that would anonymously check state's lists of liquidated addresses, so there would be a time to react and report a fraud.

One method:
The merchant doesn't actually wait for BTC transaction to be confirmed (because it'll take days with a low fee) but they write your debt in a tiny red book under the counter. Every one or two weeks they check how much BTC have arrived on the address associated with your store account, and calculate how much debt you have left. Of course if you think you'll visit them often, then you pay some BTC in advance.
Basically this is how LN would work, only on a millisecond scale.

The Good: In the year 2023 Lightning Network is fully operational and every country uses Bitcoin.
The Bad: In the year 2023, Lightning Network is an instantaneous derivatives token market for trading Bitcoin fee futures. A single Bitcoin transaction that moves value compared to 5kg of gold creates 25kg of gold fee derivative values that are high-frequency traded on Lightning Network to enable transaction to finish under 12 weeks, because there are transactions from two years ago still waiting their 4th confirmation on mainchain. There are 15 Million Bitcoins in circulation, but the fee trade derivatives market is worth over 100 Million Bitcoins. Countries are printing fiat money convertible with Bitcoin but owning or spending Bitcoin is harder than spending gold, so no one ever thinks about Bitcoin.

I didn't advocate looting or plundering anyone. Taking $100M from a man who has $200M is not the same as taking $100 from a man who has $200.

Do I have to remind you that wealth usually makes people do bad things, from tax evasion to uniting into subversive secret societies. Wealthy people often feel like they are above the law, and more so they support corruption in the society as a way of getting even more benefits. This is happening in all countries of the world, everywhere throughout history. This is human nature.
No matter how many USDs or Bitcoins you have, you can only sleep in one bed at a time, under one roof. _No one_ really needs a house with 100 rooms and 20 bathrooms; a decent house in suburbia is more than enough. You don't eat or drink more than any other person because you have wealth. You don't have higher medical expenses than any other person because you're rich. You don't _need_ to have a rainbow collection of Lambos in the garage to get from point A to point B.
Lastly, most of the time, the rich people aren't rich because of their own merits, but because the society gave them an opportunity to grow. A bus driver in India will _never_ be able to get a higher wage than a bus driver in America, simply because his society wouldn't let him. A boy in Nigeria will never be able to become a high-paid programmer, because the state's schooling system is bad, there is no Internet available, and he has to work hard from early age to support his family. On the other hand, a boy in France will have a peaceful childhood where he will learn most skills he'd need to have a good salary. Therefore, it is a duty of the rich to return an amount of their wealth back to the society via taxes. Philanthropy of the rich people is nothing short of hypocrisy; they should just pay taxes like everyone else does, and not hide their money in off-shore zones.

If you sense a crash incoming, put your funds on an exchange, make a sell order, and hold both thumbs up that the exchange itself doesn't close and declare bankruptcy.

The truth is no matter how much BTC you want to buy now, there's always that guy who bought 5000 BTCs back in 2011-2012, and you can never, ever, not in a billion years compete with that guy. Game is over for you before it started.
After a thousand years, your 0.059 BTC squeezed from your life's savings could buy you a nice interstellar cruiser.

You can spend the money by exchanging BTC bills with other people. It's not a replacement for the BTC network, just a method to exchange them in environments where there's no Internet access. It combines the anonymity of fiat cash, the value of Bitcoin, and adds the security of a government's legal and penalty system.

If you can live without these 100 euros, then do invest. Most people can survive without 50% of their money. In some welfare states that goes to over 90%, as the government pays nice unemployment aids.

In a way, Bitcoin is worse than classical bank accounts, because anyone can see the flow of money, not just the banks. If your neighbor knows your BTC address, he can see where you earned and spent your money. Not to mention IRS.
Also it allows an unprecedented level of centralized control if a "kill switch" is installed into it's roots. Unlike gold, Bitcoin is based on mathematical algorithms, more precisely the SHA256 hashing algorithm which is employed to mine Bitcoins. No one can spend your Bitcoins if they don't know the private keys to the wallet. The keys cannot be brute-forced. But...
Imagine if SHA256 algorithm was already cracked by NSA. The moment this scientific proof explaining the flaw in SHA256 gets out in the public, that very day, **all** Bitcoins will immediately become null. Their value would become zero. There won't be a hyper-inflation, or an economic crisis, it would be like flipping a switch. Click - off - all your savings do not exist anymore. And then the anarchy begins.

Fractions don't matter much if there isn't any substance to support the value. Behind a house, there is a certain value. A house can never be sold below 20-30% of it's market price, while a Bitcoin or any other crypto can be valuated at 0$.
We can buy things with USD, even with gold coins. Heck, we can buy things with houses, with sheep, with leopard skins. Leopard skins have more usability value versus Bitcoin.
Then, can we buy things with BTC? Ehhhhhh, kinda harder. Long wait times, high fees, zero privacy compared to cash or card. What if there's no electricity? You're out of luck.

Actually, let's try to think clearly for one moment. One. Damn. Moment.
One day in the future, we will have 100.000.000 people using Bitcoin, that's still barely 10% adoption in the Western world alone, and let's assume that each one of those people will be holding a Bitcoin wallet with an average 500k$ worth. Early adopters will be worth, like 1B$, regular folks will be at around 100k$, in average that's about 1M$ per wallet. That's 0.17 BTC on average for each of those wallets if BTC reaches 1M$ valuation.
Let's see how much USD is that: 100M people * 1M$ worth in the wallet = 100 Trillion USD.
For comparison: USD total circulation in 2015 = 1.5 Trillion USD.
So you guys are saying that somehow, the amount of money in circulation will increase 10-fold just by introducing Bitcoin?
I'll tell you what will happen.
1) The USD will inflate dramatically, which would alleviate the price increase of USD, and it wouldn't matter if BTC is 1M$ when a gallon of petrol costs, like, 10k$.
2) Governments all over the world will ban cryptocurrencies. It will be far worse than war on drugs.
Or, the most likely scenario:
3) Bitcoin will crash.
In this most likely scenario, let's assume USD had inflated to 2.5 Trillion in circulation, and that total BTC in circulation will be about 17 million.
**2.5e12 / 17e6 = 147.000$**
This, ladies and gentlemen, is the maximum ceiling price of Bitcoin on a real, non-speculating planet Earth. Anything above this would lead to a hard crash, or a big economic crisis.
Please correct me with facts, I want to be wrong on this.

Yes, you do not need a bank account to use crypto. But you need a form of wallet: paper, computer, or dedicated device (Ledger/Trezor).
For small transfers, it might be easier and less expensive to use Litecoin or Dogecoin. They have shown to be stable currencies and transfer times and fees are favorable compared to Bitcoin. Also some coins like Dogecoin are so low in value, that you don't need decimal places. Instead of sending 0.0056 BTC you can send 28.000 Doges. Seems much easier.
EDIT: If the concept of "wallet" is hard to understand, you can just call it "account", like any bank account. Because the concept is similar.

Paypal is centralized, which means it's way faster, but if the site is down you can do nothing. Paypal has insurances so if someone steals your money or scams you at a sale, you can ask for a refund. Downside is that they can hold your money for whatever reason.
Bitcoin is decentralized, which means it's slow and relatively hard to use, but the network itself is near impossible to destroy. If you make a mistake sending money, or someone scams you on ebay, there are no refunds. Also, it's much a complicated job to keep money in Bitcoin.

There are two possible outcomes here:
1) SHA256 is already cracked.
Cryptocoins will become widespread in 2-3 years. All coins other than Bitcoin will lose value or become prohibited. Early investors in BTC will become super-rich, but then again they are just people, flesh and blood, they can be persuaded or forced to lay low, to be prisoners in their expensive mansions unable to do anything to stop the downfall.
2) SHA256 is safe.
In this case, cryptocurrencies are a great way of overthrowing the deep state, and we should invest in the good ones (e.g. Monero). Goal of the deep state would be to persuade public to abandon crypto. What better reason, than to pump Bitcoin to 100.000$ and then deflate it down to 1.000$. It would be 1929 all over again. People will stop using crypto, many would commit suicide as all their lives have been for nothing. Then, the state-controlled investors would take over cryptocurrencies and turn them into big players alley, and that would soon cause another crisis like the one in 2008.

Arthur C. Clarke was a great visionary who lived in Sri Lanka. He thought that the most perfect currency for the world would be pure energy. Imagine having a USB flash drive which can hold enough power to run a house for a year. That kind of currency would have ultimate value which would be impossible to forge and impossible to collapse. Clarke even imagined a world where all currency would be imaginary like today's Bitcoin, and that world was destroyed by a solar flare which disrupted the Internet and stopped world communications.
Every currency is just a fiat (follower) to energy.
Gold can be exchanged but ultimately we cannot eat it, or burn it to get warm or cook dinner.
Bitcoin is better than gold, but still it's only a follower of energy. It allows you to make other people work for you, and provide you with food, clothing, housing, etc. But if the civilization fails, you can't eat Bitcoin. You can't burn Bitcoin like you can burn $$$ bills.

Yes, Bitcoin seems more suitable for civilizations who have discovered an unlimited energy source, so they only need to optimize the production efficiency of their economies, not the distribution of scarcity.

Spikes and exponential growth makes investing into a dedicated miner a really hard choice.
Maybe go with a multiple GPU rig, so you can mine altcoins which are more profitable. Go to nicehash.com and find a profitability calculator, see how much money each GPU could make. When mining is no longer profitable at all, you can sell GPUs to rich gamer kids. ;)
However the calculation is changed completely if you can get free electricity. Sometimes living in East Europe has it's perks. I hear rumors there's an abandoned factory near Subotica with underground full of mining rigs, which somehow gets "free" electricity. I'm sure isn't the only one. :D

Okay here goes:
Things which don't let me sleep at night:
- I should've bought BTC back in 2014. Back then I thought it's going to disappear, become heavily regulated, or be replaced by better coins.
Things that make me sleep at night (I still cry in my sleep though):
- I regret buying BTC at $9000 back in November. Should've bought Doge or Nano, much better returns. I'm late to the party, which makes my 2014 prediction even more true.
- With BTC I'm still where I was 6 months ago and my initial investment is withering away as BTC slowly slides back to it's real "production cost" value of $1-1.5k. Stupid! Told you so in 2014!
- At least I invested only what I could afford to lose. Just think what would've happened if you went all in.

Sure! Are you saying that anyone with 0.2 BTC or more will be the new rich class of the mid-21st century?
First, the existing rich people who run the world will never _ever_ allow this to happen. Bitcoin is just a speculative asset right now. If it can be anything more, we'd be having a false flag EMP bomb going off in every major city and data center. What's remaining of the internet will be censored to unuseability.
Second, if you somehow manage to take down the current ruling class, think of the remaining 99.9% of the world population who'll have zero BTC. Not good for the business! And do you think those people who have zero BTC will be for your revolution (where ones with BTC will be kings and everyone else are peasants or slaves), or wanting the old (today's) system back?

I think Satoshi was probably a group of Russian scientists, most probably acting on accord of a government agency.
- Russians have the best mathematicians and cryptographers in the world. No Russian code has ever been broken. They've been using one-time pads since forever because they understood that any kind of cryptography can and will be broken in future.
One good example of the type of character working in Satoshi team, would be Grigori Perelman: "I'm not interested in money or fame; I don't want to be on display like an animal in a zoo.", or check out this quote: "_I know how to control the Universe._ Why would I run (for the Fields Medal) to get a million ($), tell me?"
So, their scientists and mathematicians are totally out of this world. Incomparable.
- Who would profit the most by taking down the global fiat system? Russia and their allies, of course. They showed they are self-sustainable and can survive for decades under war and sanctions. Europe, Commonwealth, and North America would crumble if banks and credits are removed. Russia's national debt is low.
- We've seen that Mr. Putin is completely okay with cryptocurrencies. He shook hands with Vitalik Buterin, but exiled Pavel Durov.
- There's a clique in Russian politic circles which loves to raise revolutions and change basic systems of operating countries. They're all about _paradigm shift_.
- Russians learn British English, not American in their schools, so this explains why Satoshi had spoke (wrote) British English.
- UK and The Times is more closer to Moscow than to California.

If a player decides to do a 51% attack, their hashrate would be so overwhelming that obsolete hardware wouldn't be much useful. Only a hyper-fast difficulty adjustment network algorithm would help.
Imagine a 6-floor underground facility in Fort Meade or Utah. It goes online in late 2019. It's filled with 10nm liquid-nitrogen cooled ASICs, with a combined hashpower of about 10-15 Exahash/s. There's a huge flywheel energy storage device at the facility's lowest level, providing peak power for the ASICs if there's not enough coming from the national power grid. The facility is owned by a government player.
Now imagine a similar facility in Seoul or Shanghai or Moscow. Only one of those facilities would be able to bring down all SHA256 cryptocurrencies in the world... Mutually Assured Destruction. Completely crazy, isn't it? All of that made obsolete by 50 lines of code for a better difficulty adjustment algorithm.
What the old miners could be useful are non-competitive blockchains. At some point there will be a large number of SHA256 ASIC miners with hashrate so low it won't be economical to run them. I see them being used or rented by companies or governments who create their own blockchains for things like storage of documents, ownership data, identity data, etc. They wouldn't need a high hashrate, and the old miners could be used to run these non-currency blockchains.

Changing PoW makes all the existing miners useless. People spend millions of $$$ to buy ASIC miners. When you change PoW from SHA256 to something else, all these ASIC mining hardware is obsolete, and big miners who bought SHA256 would change to another coin.
If you fix difficulty adjustment to stop 51% attacks from happening, then no need to change PoW.
Some coins (VTC, GRS...) can change PoW algorithm, so no ASIC can be made for them. But it can be mined using GPU farms, so if a big player can make huge GPU farms then it's also useless.
Whoever makes a PoW coin which is resistant to 51% attacks will make a big advancement in crypto coin tech. PoS makes 51% attacks obsolete, but it's not fair economically (rich become rich by hodling, there's no mining).

Are you saying that high fees on mainnet are actually good for Bitcoin? My opinion is that this is what stopped the bullrun of late 2017. Weak hands at some point realized that Bitcoin cannot work as advertised (brightest example would be that "Bitcoin conference stops taking Bitcoin payments" news title) and started to panic sell.
If LN had been ready last summer, the bullrun would've ended with much higher end price, and BCH fork wouldn't happen at all, or it would be rather unsuccessful, in line with Bitcoin Gold or Diamond.
Until I test an LN wallet on mainnet myself I can only speak for BCH, because I've tried it and it works as BTC did 2 years ago, and low fees make it really easy. I've seen some LN clients (Eclair, lnd) but they were for testnet only, and there were no Android/iOS versions ready, nor Windows binaries available, so I assumed it was still under development, without an ETA.

Because it was the first one which actually worked, and offered something new and revolutionary, which no other payment system had at that time? It was a revolutionary new technology, and in that sense I think LN isn't a revolution but a logical evolution of an existing system.


May I offer an analogy? Early ink-jet printers had problems with ink cartridges, because these were too expensive and offered very little ink. Epson solved this by making printers with fixed printing heads and large ink tanks where you can add more ink by buying cheaper bottles which have more ink inside than the cartridges. This didn't solve the nozzle clogging problem, though. HP solved this by keeping the cartridge system, and offering users a "customer program" where they send you new cartridges via courier, at a discount price, and in frequency according to ink consumption reported by your printer via cloud.
I'm trying not to be skeptical about LN, and struggling to see the light. I know how the Internet scales, and I think the OSI model is the right concept for any communication system. A.Anotonopulos explained this in one video, saying how phone companies eventually ditched the classical telecom lines and multiplexing in favor of the TCP/IP.


There are some technologies which can scale without any second layer, e.g. polyphase electrical distribution systems, conceived in the early 1900s. That's why I've held onto the idea of blockchains as a good scaling methods. The price ratio between BTC/BCH should be telling me enough, still, I wonder why BCH isn't down to $10 yet. And maybe I've answered my own question now.


It might be that I haven't been reading the right articles. Thinking with your own mind is hard, so we tend to simplify things. The abyss between thinking and comprehending is where scams spawn and fly up to the surface.

I think you need at least 1 satoshi per byte, and a tx is around 250 bytes, so minimal fee is 250 satoshi for a 1 input 1 output tx. I'm aware BTC network works with very low fees at the moment. This could change in the future, though.

PoW coin is a chain/ecosystem made of developers, miners, and users. Did I miss someone? Each of these parties needs to have some kind of benefit from the system, and I agree with that. Resource management is important.
I've studied the technical side of Bitcoin, but didn't go much into the economics and sustainability. What I eventually concluded, is that if a coin's market price drops below a certain point, it would no longer be sustainable for miners, and that would lead to heavy centralization and hashrate attacks. That's my main issue with BCH right now. Likewise, my main issue with BTC is that if tx fees rise, the coin won't be appealing to end users as a medium of exchange, while the miners would be certainly incentivized with higher fees and would keep securing the hashrate. You're completely right in that regards, that every participant in the coin's "game" needs to have a positive outcome. If there's no incentive for everyone, the coin isn't sustainable long-term.
LN will enable sub-satoshi payments, I have no doubts it will, as it has no blockchain-related limitations, and I've seen videos showing LN clients in action. My doubt is that it's implementation in the field will be overly complicated, thus hard to setup and prone to errors. Then again, I might be wrong about these concerns.
Fair enough?
