As far as I'm concerned, Nakowa freerolled 1300 BTC and lost. What if he had won, deposited his own BTC and cashed out? Do you honestly believe his [bullshit]( story? 
Did you know Nakowa stole the LD design from Dooglus? I asked Dooglus myself.


My point is, Nakowa is an unethical cunt and he does not deserve the asskissing that he got from clicking "hi" and giving away 1/3rd of his usual 300 BTC bet on just dice. If you still don't get it, let me spell it out clearly. 
Nakowa is a very bad guy. He's just doing this to advertise his website. You are literally cheering a thief who stole 1300 BTC, and buys 56 BTC worth of karma. Of course the sheep won't understand.
Check your sources next time.

Lol. Great marketing move there, Nakowa.
Systematically killing JD, advertising LD.. and burying that 1300 BTC scandal where you stole 1300 BTC, and having Reddit kiss your ass.. all for 1 click.
Brilliant move. its like hitting 4 birds with one mouse click.
I admire that move... but I am your opponent. I look forward to your next dice visit. Of course all the Reddit sheep will downvote the shit out of the truth. Nakowa is a thief. But It doesn't matter, they donated right? Steal, 1300 BTC, donate 56 BTC.. get instant fanclub. Amazing.
