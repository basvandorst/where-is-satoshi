It's primarily because people see a price around 10k and see it as a buy opportunity. Bitcoin doesn't act like stocks. People expect it to be long term bullish so view these dips as a good in. They're most likely correct too. I advise buying now cuz we probably won't see anything this low ever again.

What kind of "commercial property" is it?

IMHO the OP has a pretty good point... These are the people responsible for making the decisions that effect the whole dollar-based economy and they can't even work out a workable system for their own funding. Why shouldn't we boycott them as much as possible since we now have an at least somewhat viable alternative. Granted he didn't express it quite so eloquently but considering he was posting a mini-rant on social media instead of writing an economics thesis the style was fairly appropriate. Either way it's a pretty far cry from "don't tip waiters cuz of thunderstorms".

If you paid for it in dollars (or any fiat) they would definitely be worth less after the meal but so would the ones in your pocket. However, by supporting a business that accepts Bitcoin you're contributing towards mass adoption that would raise the price of the Bitcoin in your wallet. That being said, I wonder how many times a day they have to update that sign.

Should've hodled... Now you have to. Coinbase did you a (unintentional) favor through their incompetence. Sell elsewhere in a couple weeks when the price goes back up.

Do you know what inflation is? It is when your money loses buying power over time and prices rise. A currency worth more over time rather than less is deflationary.

If you hold it til it goes back up you lost nothing. By your own logic holding your money in fiat would mean you lose money every day. The difference is crypto goes back up while fiats only ever go down.

If they're mining then they would definitely be mining some of their own transactions considering how large of a percentage of the transactions stem from them. I remember reading not long ago about them mining but I can't find the source right now or I would post a link. I'll keep trying to dig it up.

You do realize that the vast majority of fiat is 1s and 0s too... The primary difference between crypto and fiat is that crypto is created according to a fixed algorithm so has a limited supply while fiat can be created willy silly to suit some faceless shareholders of central banks fancies.

My point was that when Bitcoin goes down it always goes back up (so far at least). If you sell for fiat your losses will only increase. If you hodl til it goes back up you didn't lose anything.

They own enough ASICs that there's no incentive to implement batching. They make more money flooding the mempool with high fee txs. I'm sure the only reason they're implementing segwit is because of all the bad sentiment they've been getting recently on social media.
