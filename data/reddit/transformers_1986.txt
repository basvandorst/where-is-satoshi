There is no way in hell that most institutional investors touch BTC. If you invest and it keeps dropping you are fucked because you will definitely be accused of being negligent. ETFs are also not getting approved, as the SEC won't let retirement funds near an asset that is essentially illegally manipulated daily offshore.

By not buying you are essentially 1xing shorting right now. Many don't want to margin trade because volatality can liquidate you (even if you are 100% right about the direction of the price).

You mean rational person? Even the  Bitcoin-masturbatory-libertarian-REEEEEEEEing-neckbeard should have sold at 20k. Imagine how many coins you could have had if you sold at 20k and rebought now (answer: 5.4x more).

Bro, there are two common forms of order book manipulation in crypto markets that are illegal in the United States (even by foreign nationals):  order book spoofing (e.g., placing walls, or placing orders you don't plan on executing farther back in the order book to create the illusion of demand) and wash trading (buying your own orders to make it look like demand has dramatically changes like when a sell/buy wall suddenly goes from 500 BTC to zero in a second). These behaviors happen continually with BTC. I don't think there is anyone who has day traded crypto for more than five minutes that hasn't seen this. 
These manipulations are used to drive the price up and down in order to make money. These behaviors aren't illegal everywhere, but the United States still cares about these behaviors when evaluating if they will approve an ETF because they are patently against US law. I'm not talking about some macro whale conspiracy or China trying to drive down prices or some USDT conspiracy (who knows if these are happening?), I'm flagging day to day trading behavior.

I'm not opining on the utility of the CFTC's wash trading and order book spoofing rules, but these rules' focus are the "manipulation" that I am referring to here. There are clear policy arguments for both regulated and unregulated commodity and financial product markets. All I know is that the SEC is a regulator, and they believe that there is utility in regulated markets. When determining to approve or not approve an ETF, I bet ya that they will land more in the "CFTC rules are not useless garbage, and we should protect U.S. retirement funds against manipulation" camp rather than the "regulation is tyranny" camp. So, it is probably more likely that they will not approve an ETF due to the current Bitcoin market freedom/lawlessness dynamic.

I'm sorry, but quick advice, you should be careful with statements like "replacing the trash they call stock." It makes you sound like a child and a neckbeard, and outside of this echo chamber, no one at all will respect you. I'm not saying this to offend, just to provide helpful advice so you can save face and earn respect. I seriously can't believe you are actually suggesting that Bitcoin, a speculative asset, somehow has value, while stocks, backed by audited financial statements, good will, and actual businesses (e.g., Apple or McDonalds) are "trash." Pure delusion.

If it gets to 2k by December 20, it will have fallen 90% YoY. That would be kind of impressive.

Because retirement funds are not some neckbeard who maybe loses his Walmart salary while living in his parents' basement.
