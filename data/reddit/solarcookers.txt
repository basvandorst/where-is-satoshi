Right now, we're only configured for donations. Our online store doesn't accept bitcoin. But we can look into adding this in for next year.

In addition to great deals on consumer goods, you can also donate to many participating charities. Solar Cookers International is excited to take part this year.

We're ready! Solar Cookers International has accepted bitcoin donations for a while now. We are glad to participate with a Bitcoin Black Friday "deal", an option to donate to charity. It's good to see widespread media coverage.
