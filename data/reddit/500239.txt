Greg Maxwell is one of the people that ACKed this bug. 
If anything he should answer how he plans to prevent this scenario in the future. Instead he's pointing fingers at altcoin guys. This was a bug in Bitcoin and by far the biggest one since 2010 and no one's been held accountable, nor is there any discussion on future prevention or auditing of Bitcoin's changes.
@_date: 2018-09-27 17:32:22
You were one of the ones to ACK Matt Corallo's bug, how did you and 10 others miss it? How do you plan to prevent this mistake in the future? 
**edit**: and I'm shadow banned from after 3 days for sockpuppet account to show up. 3 days later lol
@_date: 2018-09-09 12:31:42
I could see my regular friends using this. A very simple and elegant way to use Bitcoin Lightning
@_date: 2018-09-27 17:57:21
multiple implementations is the best solution because right now 96% of Bitcoin nodes are using the same client creating 1 point of failure and the weakest point of Bitcoin at this time.
@_date: 2018-09-29 23:05:18
Id assume responsible commits not blind ACKs lol
@_date: 2018-09-09 12:52:34
I can see everyone creating and running this type of setup in the future as Bitcoin adoption rises. Its simple but effective
@_date: 2018-09-27 18:21:26
in agriculture it's taught that a forest with diversified flora tends to resist disease and pests better because of the forest won't fall to 1 problem. But a homogenous one has little resistance to new pests.
People keep saying Bitcoin is diversified but when 96% of clients are of one type, 1 bug can take down all 96% nodes, like this months Bitcoin inflation bug.

Except that if someone wants to give me $10 in cash, I don't need to be already holding $10 in cash. Lightning requires you have equal or greater funds to receive any. that seems like an odd step backward don't you think?
@_date: 2018-08-29 12:14:23


that's 2 big ifs. Already were back to onchain for sending $10. the second if is if Bitcoin's fees are low enough.
Again why not just use a bank if it's so complicated. 
@_date: 2018-08-28 12:22:34


With a Bank I don't need to be online to receive payments and same goes for onchain. Why the step backwards in usability? Can someone explain it?
@_date: 2018-08-17 12:27:22
oh my, that's triple what Bitcoin has. But then again Bitcoin is meant to be used a store of value and should have a low tx count.
@_date: 2018-08-17 12:37:00
Samson Mow the CSO of Blockstream calls it a store of value in all his interviews and debates. Do you need a link? 
@_date: 2018-08-29 20:14:47
I will have to think about it because Lightning requires that I run a node, or check in once every 24 hours. You choose. My grandma is never going to run a node and neither is Stacy and they sure can't be fucked to check in one their account 1/day. They'll just go back to using Venmo.
Lightning is not user friendly, and is worse than a currently working banking app like Venmo. With designs like this I can see why Bitcoin is losing adoption. Even the worst shitcoin doesn't have these high requirements for users.
@_date: 2018-08-27 16:15:47
Do I need to keep my node running 24/7 to keep my funds safe?
@_date: 2019-03-21 12:30:52
oh right your one of the illogical ones that believes Craigh S Wright is Satoshi Nakamoto. Can't argue with crazy:
@_date: 2019-03-11 19:44:59
No problem. I remember joining my first mining pool, except I didn't run my own node because I had read up on how Bitcoin works first.
Hopefully you've read up on how to setup your Bitcoin miner too. Otherwise you're mining Bitcoin for someone else....
Did you set your payout address to your personal BTC address or are you using the default?
@_date: 2019-03-11 19:21:24
is right, if you join a pool they're already running a node that you're connecting to that you point your miner at. 
What purpose does running your own node serve in this case?
@_date: 2019-03-11 20:39:03
You can tip me in BTC after you've started making money mining. And save some electricity by not running nodes that don't anything.

regardless of explanation, an issue that a user will face is still an issue. User doesn't care if it's a protocol issue or wallet issue, as the average user won't be able to tell the difference.
@_date: 2019-03-11 20:05:23
You're not done yet. 
Go change your miner default settings and BTC payout address! 
And certainly don't point your miner at your own node... you must join a mining pool to make money in today's times. You can turn off your own node since you won't be needing it.

why 8MB?
@_date: 2019-03-08 15:55:44


as does anyone with a sense of intelligence. issue is this is a social issue and people aren't going to do so with much bigger reason to. Most people learn from their mistakes and past experiences, not PSA's.


that's good, but next year it could be compression that it does know.
Personally I think the best way to go about securely holding crypto is to boot into TailOS or some live linux distro and only do business there and rely on a 12 word seed rather than a hardware device, or software device holding your private keys. This way you don't have to keep up to date with security news or trust your OS/software apps.
@_date: 2019-03-27 16:38:49
So it's profitable to mine Bitcoin at those prices? Wouldn't it be cheaper to just buy Bitcoin and hodl until the next pump?
@_date: 2019-03-06 22:10:03
Don't be silly. BSV big blocks take 45 min to propagate, not the standard 10 minutes that BCH and BTC have. 
If their mining pool wasn't all Ayre they'd see 90% of the blocks orphaned by competing mining pools. You can verify this via the block explorer.
@_date: 2019-03-26 19:03:51

@_date: 2019-03-11 19:34:35
You're welcome for the advice. Not many people understand the basics of Bitcoin to know running a node isn't needed when joining a mining pool which is already running it's own node LOL!

1 issue is enough to quit? Lightning has many flaws but we still use it.

switching to 7-zip won't solve the issue. the issue is within the ACE format which lots of compression tools can open. 7-zip might not be immune.
@_date: 2019-03-11 19:55:20
I'm also getting the vibe that doesn't quite gets how mining works... Hopefully he's setup his miner otherwise he's not even making any money and mining for someone else.
1) He's admitted to joining a mining pool and pointing his **miner at their node.... but he still runs his own node**..... Why?


2) And I don't think he understands how mining works either... If he's solo mining which I hope he's not, then he's literally never going to make any money. We're long past those days.
@_date: 2018-10-12 14:02:27
which parts does she explain wrong and how would you explain them?
@_date: 2019-03-27 15:28:48
so going back to the original discussion:
Why are paying hating on BitPay for 1 issue, when Lightning has several compounding issues?
I'll even go one further: The sum and weight of Lightning's issues overshadow the sum and weight of BitPay's issues. 
@_date: 2018-10-12 19:19:51
on paper or in practice the Lightning wallet has more limitations than any other altcoin on the market currently. I don't see Lightning getting adopted soon because it introduces these issues that no other altcoin does:
- Can only receive as much as you hold.
- Both parties must be online to transact.
- Funds can be stolen if you don't check in enough.
- Or you hire watchtower services to watch over your funds.
- Takes 24hours/144blocks before you can close a channel.
Why go through all this when any other shitcoin out there has a much easier time, including horrible wallet issues like IOTA's.
@_date: 2018-10-11 00:23:52
it's good were finding offchain solutions to solve the onchain fees.
@_date: 2019-03-27 17:54:13
That's all well and good but you're just bringing more reason to focus on Lightning's problems than BitPay's. 
For one thing BitPay isn't needed for Bitcoin, but Lightning is the defacto Bitcoin scaling solution which must work. Why focus on optional payment methods over must have payment methods? Why not put the energy into working on stuff that matters? 
It's been over [4 years since the first time the "18 months" deadline was dropped by Greg Maxwell and Adam Back]( and all I hear more complaints about BitPay than Lightning.
@_date: 2018-10-15 12:23:33
and how much will I have to pay these 3rd party services?
@_date: 2018-10-25 14:34:16
Does Lightning inherit onchain reorg issues like this since they're dependent on the UTXO's?
@_date: 2018-10-12 17:55:55
Thats why we have exchanges that dont touch the blockchain. What is Liquid offering that exchanges don't already offer? Exchanges too hold actual Bitcoins but don't use the blockchain until you withdraw or deposit.
@_date: 2019-03-25 16:06:33


@_date: 2018-10-11 17:57:08
give you a break? You're defending a guy slinging mud rather than admitting he made a mistake and showing us how he plans to improve the process.
@_date: 2018-10-15 13:06:31
that sounds convenient. Out of 2000+ altcoins right now, LN is the only wallet to require running your node 24/7.
@_date: 2018-10-12 15:26:21
My understanding is that you dance around your original statement but won't explain it because you don't actually understand the article well enough to be able to cite a wrong section.
@_date: 2018-10-12 17:39:32
I'd say it's the opposite way. Lightning was a stopgap and a late on at that and Liquid is the future for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-10-25 16:21:59
If you open a Lightning channel using UTXO's from blocks that get reorged then that Lightning channel is invalid and cashing out to onchain will fail won't it?
@_date: 2018-10-12 16:57:17


It goes both ways. 2 people can comment in the same thread, one saying yay one neigh. Then who's right? That's when you start discussing specifics points until it becomes clear who is correct. But in the case of refusing to discuss and dancing around the statement and then resorting to personal attacks, it becomes clear they can't stand behind their own statement or don't understand it.
Just to be clear, no commenter in this thread so far has been able to point to specific statements in the article which are wrong and why. They just throw blanket statements without explaining themselves.
You too, are discussing me rather than the article. Are you able to point out the flaws in this article, because was not able to.
@_date: 2018-10-12 15:36:20
Can you expand on it? Here's my view:
- If Liquid moves Bitcoin trading offchain, then onchain transaction volume decreases, because trades are occuring offchain.
- If onchain transaction volume decreases then Bitcoin fee's decrease.
- If Bitcoin onchain fee's decrease then you can just transact onchain and there's no need for Lightning to decrease fees.
Looks straight forward.
@_date: 2018-10-12 12:36:17
Well if Liquid moves most of the Bitcoin traffic offchain, then Bitcoin's onchain traffic is relieved and you can just transact onchain. Lightning was only created to relieve onchain fees by moving them offchain. 
@_date: 2018-10-13 02:26:20
It seems theres a lot of market for fees
@_date: 2018-10-12 19:54:33


Well why not? Do just trust everything that anyone says on the internet, or do you verify on your own?
@_date: 2018-10-12 14:50:56
My history has nothing to do with you making your statement. You made the statement but you keep dancing around it when it comes time to back it up and I'm confused why? Are you not able to back it up?
@_date: 2019-03-20 12:31:45


did you know the 'bcash' campaign started waaay before Bitcoin Cash even forked off? 
Waaay before even Roger Ver even said the famous "Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin".
@_date: 2018-10-12 19:58:41
The issue that the article is trying to point out is that if the majority of Bitcoin transaction volume happens off chain, then miners don't get fees and when block rewards expire, miners will have no incentive to support the blockchain, as they won't get any rewards for mining blocks. The incentive system of Bitcoin then changes.
@_date: 2018-10-12 17:24:08


OK lets run through this though experiment. If you're arguing that Bitcoin is liquid, then why the need for a platform that is used to solve liquidity issue. The goal of Liquid is to provide liquidity to Bitcoin and quoted from the [Federation Whitepaper here](

@_date: 2018-10-12 14:39:46
I'm confused. Are you intentionally trying to derail the conversation? 
I asked you to back up your claim and cite what's wrong with this article and you're telling it's not illegal to use a PC. Are you a bot?
that's like saying "look over there!" and when someone says, "where?" you say "It's not illegal to look". wtf?

It seems like there won't be a need for Lightning with Liquid. Lightning seems like a placeholder for now.
@_date: 2018-10-12 20:58:27
but why should the miners do it for free when Liquid is taking all the fees offchain?
@_date: 2019-03-07 01:29:07




BSV is churning big blocks alright, but they lifted the blocksize too fast without fixing any software bottlenecks. They literally copied the Bitcoin Cash ABC client and just lifted a few numbers with no other work done. A block that takes 40 minutes to propagate would have been orphaned 4 times over lol.
@_date: 2019-02-15 19:15:10

Sim cards in the USA expire and balance drains over time, so this must just be a T-Mobile netherlands thing as they have better pro consumer laws. Britain/Europe and USA sure have their SIM cards expire and account balance drain over time. I know from experience.

@_date: 2019-02-01 22:16:58
tragedy of the developers actually. There was a choice to softfork or hardfork which would have immediately relieved the fees unlike SegWit.
@_date: 2019-02-15 20:53:06


Those sound like exceptions not the rule. Almost every prepaid gift card including prepaid VISA in the USA slowly drains balance either due to inactivity or over time. 
You guys are acting like Bitpay is the exception to the rule when in fact it's the standard. The majority of prepaid cards drain over time versus not.

@_date: 2019-04-05 17:52:24
The difference between Bitcoin and Bcash is that with Bcash Bitmain makes all the decisions, with Bitcoin users make all the decisions as shown with USAF. 1 node = 1 vote. USAF decided to reject the miners contentious SegWit2x fork and the Core developers listened to the users and rejected the so called New York Agreement that miners colluded. If it wasn't for all those USAF nodes securing the Bitcoin network, things would have been much much worse.
Fast forward to today and Bitcoin is in a brilliant position where you can still run a node on a raspberry pi, and LN nodes bring so much advanced technology that running a Lightning Node is almost a requirement if you want to secure your investment. Which is actually a good thing because the more nodes we have the stronger Bitcoin becomes. One day I can see every user owning and running a Lightning node in their basement right next to their cable modem and WIFI router. Hopefully it'll be as common place as people once had VCR's underneath their TV's.
Yeah some recommend watchtower services but I don't trust custodial services, because it goes against the permissionless idea of Bitcoin. So again I recommend we do not push for custodial services, and instead recommend people to start running nodes because that's what Bitcoin is all about.
@_date: 2019-04-02 00:02:54
does it require me to trust a 3rd party? Or can I use Bitcoin how it was intended?
@_date: 2019-04-05 18:54:22


but that is what's going on now. I can't find a working LN wallet that has full send/receive and where routing is easy to setup. And several years later it's not gotten any better.
when I first heard about Bitcoin I bought some, got a Bitcoin wallet and I pulled some friends into the scene. Sending money back and forth was easy and simple. Today.... We've made 1 step forward and 8 steps back. and LN is still many years from adoption.
@_date: 2019-04-02 16:28:06


I just checked they don't. 
Sent some BTC dust and BCH dust to my Bitfinex and indeed the BCH deposit was acknowledged by Bitfinex after 1 confirmation **(10minutes)** versus the BTC depost which took 3 confirmations **(30minutes)**.
Why does Bitfinex trust Bcash more than Bitcoin? Is it related to fees or blocksize or what?
@_date: 2019-04-02 17:37:48
I just traded my BCH to USDT after 1 confirmation, so not true. 
Do you even have a Bitfinex account?
So why is BTC treated like a less trustless coin by Bitfinex over bcash?
@_date: 2019-04-05 18:02:35
Actually that's the slippery slope bcashers fell for. Be careful you don't lead more people down that road or you yourself follow that path.
As blocks get bigger and bigger less and less users can run nodes that can keep up with the network. Over time you'll have very few nodes left securing the network. Lightning on the other hand is a genius way to scale because it incentives people to run nodes because of the advanced technology. If there is a network change that makes running a node harder nodes will fall off and users will complain, thus defending the Bitcoin network. By running a node you are securing the network, not miners who are blinded by greed.
@_date: 2019-04-05 14:49:14
Please don't promote custodial wallets. That's not why Bitcoin was created for. With Bitcoin you're supposed to be in complete control of your own money and custodial is the opposite of that.
Please don't confuse new users. Otherwise you might as well just use PayPal.
@_date: 2019-04-05 19:33:18


Idk about that. We've 18 months for... 4.5 years now. i'd estimate LN is maybe 60% done. so maybe another 3-4 years at this rate.
@_date: 2019-04-01 18:33:42
but you need first need to move your BTC into your lightning wallet, so instant after that step.
@_date: 2019-04-05 14:23:37
i've heard to not use full custodial because then you're not really in control of your own Bitcoin. Essentially it's like leaving your money sitting on an exchange.
@_date: 2019-04-02 17:30:15
It's not a mistake. Test for yourself on your Bitfinex account. I couldn't believe it myself.
When you send BTC to bitfinex your wallet says pending 1/3 confirmations. When you send BCH it says 1/1.
I could be a Bitconnect fanboy for all you care but the Bitfinex situation is still true. Verify yourself, I'm not lying.
@_date: 2019-04-05 15:37:18


So then please don't promote custodial wallets.
Bitcoin fought so hard against Bcash'es attempts at centralizing Bitcoin so that everyone can continue to run a node today and verify your own TX and hold your own coins. Using custodial wallets is ignoring the whole USAF campaign and what it meant as well as dropping the attribute of Bitcoin that makes it so great: Permissionless cash.
@_date: 2019-04-03 12:25:29

So is the blockchain growing by size or by weight when adding these blocks? 
@_date: 2018-11-04 00:47:53
So Lightning inherits onchain weakness?
@_date: 2018-11-05 18:35:55
That doesn't answer my question. At the end of the the day when the software client flushes the block to the disk, is the block taking up size in terms of 'size' or 'weight'?
@_date: 2018-11-05 18:57:50
OK so for 1 full block of zero witness data we get a 1MB block flushed to disk. What about a block 100% of witness data, ie all Segwit Tx's. What is the blocksize of that, once flushed to disk? 
@_date: 2018-11-05 19:07:49


It seems this is an estimate. Assuming all Segwit Tx's in a full block, what is the possible range for a block size flushed to disk? I hear reports anywhere from 2.3MB to 4MB. Does that sounds accurate?
@_date: 2018-11-05 19:39:52
Thank you for the math, It's really helpful to follow along. However I'm having trouble seeing where Bitcoin benefits from using Segwit over a block equivalent in size when flushed to disk. They seem equal. I don't get it. Can you explain?
* in your explanation you mention that a Bitcoin block filled with only Segwit transactions can fit ~7380 Tx's per / 1.6MB of space on disk.
* A regular Bitcoin of 1MB size can fit 4,424 Tx's @ 228 bytes each(typical TX size). If we were to fill up a block with regular Bitcoin Tx' to match the Segwit Block size on disk to 1.6MB, then we could fit 7,078 Tx's in that block. Formula is basic proportions
So Segwit only gives us a 4% increase in the best case scenario? Why not just use bigger blocks?
@_date: 2019-01-17 17:39:25

Because you too are human and hava made mistakes in the past. Like ACK'ing the Bitcoin inflation bug with Matt Corralo without so much as a unit test.

hold up, so segwit transactions are less efficient than regular block TX's? And Bitcoin has done many hard forks since 2011, I was here since 2011. Why are hardforks bad now? Every other currency does hardforks regularly from Monero to Ethereum.

Because there's a requirement that a certain amount of coin days need to be burned for a 0 fee TX to go through.

didn't Greg Maxwell email Faketoshi this week?

Yet the recent Bitcoin inflation bug introduced by Matt Corallo/Greg Maxwell requires a hardfork no? Isn't that required right now? And if there's another critical bug introduced to Bitcoin that'll be another hardfork.

How are they supporting bcash over bitcoin?

How do you control your own keys with Bakkt, when it's a multisig? You can't move your coins until the other parties in Bakkt allow you to.
@_date: 2018-12-11 20:51:54
doesn't Bakkt hold your keys for you?
@_date: 2018-12-11 21:56:24
this isn't asking how you use Bitcoin, it's asking what purpose does Bakkt serve if not a Bank and why use it over Coinbase?
 I mean why use Bakkt over Coinbase when both function the same way? Both keep your Bitcoins safe as a bank would and both cover 100% of loses. Only difference is Coinbase is here today and has lower fees than Bakkt.

So keep your money on coinbase.com which exists today. If they get hacked they have an insurance policty to cover you 100%


And it's cheaper than Bakkt's fees.
