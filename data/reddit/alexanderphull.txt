You can make any semantic argument you want but whether im imprisoned or killed has no effect on the coins value. If anything killing and impisoning btc holders will reduce the circulation of coins and increase the value of the network through deflation.

Sales tax will be possible. Income tax will have to be voluntary.  As it should have always been. Btc is unconfiscatable.

Once we reach this point heres some things I see. 
All income taxation will be impossible.
People will no longer be able to vote for politicians to expand government programs.
Low income, low IQ, and low energy people will not be able to aquire resources through the gov. They will be forced to go to charity or provide value.
This will bring back evolutionary pressures to human reproduction that have been corrupted by the welfare state. 
Productive high IQ people will be able to aquire resources and attract sexual partners and pass on their genes more often than the low IQ unproductive members of society.
This will lead to a deepening of the genepool by passing on better genetic material. 
Governments will slowly become more localised until they only exist at the local level.
Bitcoin will essentially bring about a global libertarian order. 
Communists, socialists, and all others who crave centralized authority in the form of collective ownership, will establish communes and collectives but will be unable to confiscate bitcoin through force and collective intimidation.  Humanity will be free to do anything eccept use governments to confiscate bitcoin through force.

Then you will see bitcoin (wealth) being invested in countrys with more liberty and respect for private property. The poor will have to be protected by private charity. Any state apparatuses will have to be voluntary because coercive redistribution will be impossible.

Large corporations can get away with what they do because big government has corruption for sale to the highest bidder. Will corruption still exist? Of course it will. But corporations do not have the power to start regime change wars that result in hundreds of thousands of innocent lives being lost in senseless war. Will corporations do corrupt things in a stateless society? Yes. But without a state to save them (bailouts, gov contracts, regulations that prevent competition) these corporations will be overtaken by competitors.  For example all current monopolies are supported by the state. A stateless society will not be utopian because humans are flawed and can be corrupted. But the amount of evil and democide will be non existent compared to the current model of Ruling hundreds of millions if not billions. The idea is that the more power is dissolved down to the local level, the more free people are to opt out of one system and pack up and move to another area. 
And the beauty of America is our entire population can own weapons that deter any group from trying to run roughshod over citizens.  Check out the whiskey rebellion, the battle of athens, and admiral Yamamoto's decision not to invade California after pearl harbor. His quote was "we will find a rifle behind every blade of grass". 
 (including the devastation of the civil war that essentially wiping out entire genterations and destroyed the nations economy) 
America from 1776-1913 had hard money backed by gold and a non existent federal bureaucracy that allowed a non country to spring up and completely beat out every other nation in terms of development and innovation.  All because, for the most part we left people alone and didnt take their stuff. 
The evolution of our nation into a democracy that has universal sufferage is one of the points Alexis de Tocqueville pointed out in "democracy in America" when he noticed that at some point in the future our system could be manipulated  so that people could just vote money into their pockets as one of the major flaws in our system. And he was correct.
Imagine. In the case of America. 50 independent structures. Communism in California, Ancap in Texas, mixed economy of Washington, democracy in Florida. Let people decide which system is best by allowing them to opt into whichever fits their lifestyle.
There should be no federal programs. And for that matter depending on the population size of the state programs should be limited to City and town. That way citizens can effect the management of the systems more quickly and efficiently.

Because providing id is everything crypto is against.  Fuck the government. And fuck institutions who need to know who you are and what youre doing with your coins.

Yes tax dollars paid salaries of the engineers who created tcp/ip. But the free market made the net what it is today. And i would argue that the market would have brought us the net as well and done it without using coercion to fund the RnD.. 
And btw bitcoin is already being used in black markets to undermine collectivist structures. Your hypothetical wokers coop requires robots not humans lol

I dont hold any coin yet so im safe lol.
@_date: 2019-08-27 15:50:08
So is the general sentament that these coins will be dumped on exchanges to cash out into fiat?
@_date: 2019-08-06 23:16:35
Wow this post got a ton of engagement. Very interesting to see such a wide range of political philosophy in the bitcoin space.  Im glad we have some commies and socialists in here keeps things hot and spicy.

Obviously you cant go full Anarchic in 24 hrs. I think this new tech will severely limit autocratic governments that rely on top down use of force to fund public projects. (Ie. Using guns to build libraries, schools, and roads.) Essentially a reversion to 18th and 19th century american economics where there is no income tax and the government funds itself through tariffs. 
I believe that if bitcoin becomes the world reserve (most likely in 30-50 years) that tax revenue will have to come from point of sale as well as import and export taxes. But the reduction in bitcoin for the feds will mean that Americans will have to voluntarily contribute to charity to provide assistance and services. And due to there being no massive government beurocracy to buy and corrupt to benefit private businesses, i believe you will see more ethical and responsible businesses. 
As for fire and police services. I could see insurance companies providing services likes this, seeing as how they have a massive economic incentive to not pay out insurance claims. Or small co-ops pooling bitcoin to pay private security and fire services for the ability to live in the cooperative.  Either way i see massive central government structures slowly loosing power and humanity relying more on cooperative voluntary arrangements that exist on an opt in basis. This new future will allow for thousands of independent economic systems to coexist while allowing people to vote with their feet and bitcoin as to which system is the most fair and just.

Ok that was very hard to understand. And you dont need to add the caveat that youre steelmaning the socialist argument. I dont understand how that world we even begin to take shape from private holdings. The way i see this tech playing out is exactly how the jnternet played out. Completely voluntarily, individuals freely donating time and capital. Your example sounds like north North Korea, small group of leaders directing slave labor.

That defeats the purpose of crypto.

How many here think this will result in institutions shorting btc like when futures launched?
@_date: 2019-09-06 17:55:38
I agree with everything youve said. However i think institutional investors are going to try and depress price as much as possible to accumulate more btc. And with this sell off thats occuring right now I think i may be correct. Btw I shorted 10.9k and am currently in a massive profit. Cheers
