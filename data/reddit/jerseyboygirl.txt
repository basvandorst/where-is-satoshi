Bitcoin Unlimited has no chance of ever gaining consensus. It's a ridiculous fantasy. See, this is the problem that I have with the other Bitcoin forums. They tend to be filled with extremist view points and a lot of ignorance. has extremists too, but it's *still* more balanced than "Bitcoin Forum" and Even with the idiotic censorship that goes on here.

What do you say to that Charlie is a trustworthy man and he knows something about consensus mechanisms. Why would you give Emergent Consensus the benefit of a neutral stance in light of what Charlie said?

These exchanges owe a fiduciary duty to their customers to protect them from a confusing fork situation. They did the right thing. And from a technical perspective, BU is cancer, so I'm personally delighted with this. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 07:21:52
I don't think that the Core dev team would disagree with that at all.
@_date: 2017-03-26 01:49:51
It is the essence of the problem. Who gets to decide the consensus rules? BU says the miners. Core says it's the users.
@_date: 2016-03-11 20:48:53
Huh? Why?
@_date: 2017-03-26 01:54:39
A very hard-won network effect too. It doesn't come easy as the altcoins are discovering.
@_date: 2017-03-26 01:58:12
I would think that a pool with 50PH/s would be exquisitely aware of every configuration setting they're using.
@_date: 2017-03-26 01:55:12
Business models can be copied. Network effect and user base cannot.
@_date: 2017-03-19 07:25:20
I doubt that miners would dare forking with a mere 51%. I read somewhere that they're waiting for 80%.

Yes it does seem that his ego got bruised.

It was set by Satoshi. Centralized, yes, but the software had to come from somewhere.
@_date: 2017-03-19 06:44:35
And yet the answer came...

On the other hand do you think that BitFury could convince Antpool to activate SegWit?
@_date: 2017-03-14 06:30:12
That is so untrue. One side uses brigades from the other subreddit to force false information on to the front page and to the top of threads, and it stays there. The other side routinely gets downvoted into oblivion when it tries to state the facts.  Lately the balance has been evening out, thank god, but it's a bitter fight. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 01:53:27
None of the altcoins have any serious usage, so they can do all that fancy stuff without any serious analysis being done if they're still decentralized or not. 
Don't be fooled: all of bitcoin's problems will be experienced by any true cryptocurrency that gets real user traction.
@_date: 2017-03-19 07:22:25
Of course, look at all the money at stake.
@_date: 2017-03-19 07:28:19
All that altcoin money will come back to Bitcoin anyway, it always does. Altcoins serve as alternative marketing for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-19 06:52:53
I'll blame two people in particular. Roger Ver for whipping this stupid debate into a frenzy and Jihan Wu for blocking SegWit.
@_date: 2017-03-19 06:41:16
OK if that makes you feel better. BTC = Bitcoin is how the entire market sees it.
@_date: 2017-03-19 07:03:45
Nice conspiracy theory there. The exchanges have been watching this debate and obviously figured out on their own that BU just won't have enough community support to be an obvious winner. And they're also reacting to their experience with the ETH/ETC fork that cost them and their customers money due to replay attacks. It is eminently sensible to list BU-fork as an altcoin in light of all that. 
So please go visit your doctor and get some meds for your paranoia :\^)
@_date: 2017-03-19 06:55:23


Are you talking about how Core handles this, or BU? Because Core doesn't work that way if the chains in question have differing consensus rules.
@_date: 2016-06-15 23:14:51
It's excellent moderation IMO.
@_date: 2016-06-15 23:11:42
The claims made on that page are hilariously stupid. Thank you for the laugh.
@_date: 2016-12-08 03:11:36
This is a guy who 
A) Only weakly committed to bitcoin. He said that Circle was never meant to be a Bitcoin company and that it was more about payments.
B) Never bothered to participate in its development, opting instead to complain impotently via Twitter like an old man yelling at a cloud.
C) Wished for Bitcoin to have **less** anonymity so that it would play nicer with the regulators.
D) Criticized the governance model because he would rather see bitcoin bend to Circle's exigent corporate needs rather than the needs dictated by a censorship-resistant form of digital money.
Jeremy Allaire's views of cryptocurrency are incompatible with Bitcoin and his rage quit was completely expected.
@_date: 2016-12-08 02:56:47
The issue isn't being ignored. What are you talking about? There's a scaling solution (SegWit) deployed that's waiting for miners to activate it. 
@_date: 2016-12-08 02:57:26
It should be clear that the economic majority is loyal to Core, by a long shot, Circle notwithstanding.
@_date: 2016-12-15 01:28:36
Wow... you just don't get it. 
@_date: 2016-12-08 03:19:21
Bitcoin isn't different, it's just that the people from the early days who made grand claims that Bitcoin was going to replace Visa were ignorant about the technical reality, which is that Bitcoin has serious efficiency challenges it must solve first before expanding the block size if it is to remain decentralized. 
The people who bought into the early evangelists' message are now all bitter that reality came to rain on the parade, Allaire being one example (and Ver being another), and they are lashing out by blaming the pragmatists (over 100 developers of Core) who have being working hard to fix these serious problems so that Bitcoin *does* eventually scale.
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:28:57
Legitimize? Sure, as just another shitty altcoin.


They're throwing the SegWit2X supporters a bone, that's all.
@_date: 2015-11-25 19:42:47
We haven't yet seen the details of what they're proposing.
@_date: 2015-11-18 17:34:27
Perhaps his paper was rejected because it was of a policy/opinion nature, and not a technical nature. The focus of the Hong Kong conference is purely technical.
@_date: 2016-10-27 10:38:21
The ETH/ETC split show what happens when a hard fork is contentious, so hard forks aren't as straightforward as you say.
The forking incident in Bitcoin's past wasn't contentious. See the difference?
@_date: 2015-10-17 20:49:18
I like the moderation... it has really improved things.
@_date: 2017-07-13 22:17:27
You don't need all of the miners, just enough. 
And think it through: how long would miners mine a chain that isn't called BTC by the exchanges? The incentives are strong for the miners to mine the most valuable chain, i.e. the one that is chosen by the users.
It's the users who give a cryptocurrency its value, not the miners. Hashrate follows price etc.
The exchanges killed Bitcoin Unlimited's prospects of taking over by coming out with a statement that they would list it as BTU. That should tell you everything about what really matters.
@_date: 2017-07-13 22:08:59
It is the nodes that determine the rules, not the miners. Proof-of-work is a small consideration in this debate. In fact I would say that the exchanges are far more important to this debate than the miners, because it's the exchanges who assign the Bitcoin ticker symbol to the node they run.
