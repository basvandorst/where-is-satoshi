Yup. It’s a global Prisoners Dilemma. Once one falls the rest will have to or miss out on the exponential increase in value all while native currencies devalue.

@_date: 2018-03-13 14:27:13
I would suggest you finish your studies.
@_date: 2018-03-13 01:59:07
You don't have a clue, homie.
Also, you're twisting the example we were using.  Demand down now, we're talking about demand on the increasing adoption due to increased network use.


That is network use, homie.  What do you think the network is?  It's transactions - it's demand, it's activity.  I'm just saying it simply.
Again, with these last statements - we were addressing the dudes article about Proof of Work being a great system and the intent for an expanding infrastructure to support demand as incentive to create renewable energy resources.  You're talking about demand todays stuff without interest to continuing the extrapolation we were discussing.
Agree to disagree.
@_date: 2018-03-05 19:09:57
It should be affecting the price, but only with stable consistent increases in demand.  These nations are just buying BTC as an asset and often in bulk purchases.
The transaction fees are too high for everyday purchases in these nations - which is what would ultimately skyrocket BTC.
Good question.
Technical analysis only works for identifying manipulation.  It's not great for predicting - stick to fundamental analysis and hold for the long term.
@_date: 2018-03-01 21:11:13
In terms of currency we are talking about intrinsic value of BTC due to lowered transaction costs over Fiat 
That is /intrinsically/ valuable. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 14:40:26
Yes, they totally did.  I hope this is class action.
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:25:12
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:08:43
Damn that was long.
@_date: 2018-03-12 23:36:04


The problem in the short run isn't a problem it's an intent - which was what my point was about.  The intent is focused on the long run outcome of the BTC markets interconnected incentives.


It may be at current trends but you aren't taking into account the advances in tech and efficiency of battery technology to change a lot of that.  The sun produces 1KW per second per meter sq, if I'm not mistaken - and we can only harness a small portion of that. The other incentive is for processing innovations and computational advances with the application of AI.
They do care if energy comes from renewable.  If they can get more long-term cost reducing energy alternatives they can increase their present projection of profit which has an immediate impact on their ability to sell investors and expand. Not to mention the bottom line impact to their actual earnings in the future.


The difficulty increases as the network activity increases.  The rewards do stay the same, but again you aren't considering the change that is taking place to demand for bitcoin as the network activity and thus mining difficulty increase.  Which means a capital gain in the value of bitcoin.  The reward may stay the same but the value changes.  Which really doesn't matter as long as the margins stay the same or improve.
An expanded network would also mean less and less used to pay in fiat - more and more paychecks being issued in bitcoin.  Then it doesn't even matter.  That's short-term, too - that won't take but 15 years to normalize.


FUD plays a huge role in the price of bitcoin.  As it does in any economic activity.

You better be ready for some seriously lowered expectations.
Maybe enough to make a radioactive mouse.
@_date: 2018-03-03 00:36:34
I'm right there with you.  I totally believe that, too.
I think the whole globe is about 18 months from the beginning of an incredible inflationary period and thats when BTC will really strike.
As native currencies devalue people will switch to BTC to act as a store of value which will also be a growth asset because the demand will force the price to rise.  
This will cause a Prisoner's Dilemma across the world as native currencies begin to devalue and people are put to the choice...stick with your fiat currency designed to lose value over time, or switch to BTC and not only retain your own value but the sooner you switch the more your assets will grow.
Then the whole world will be on BTC.
It's already worth $30k per coin via fundamental value alone.
@_date: 2018-03-13 13:59:07
I've already explained away all those points.  You aren't understanding how economics works and financial projections.
Capital investment is incentivized and renewable energy is the path forward for miners.  
Easy enough to say, we'll just wait and see who is right.
@_date: 2018-03-09 16:40:53
It's still a measure economists use as its a tool to compare one country to another; what we see is that countries with a debt to GDP is over 100% have shown significant financial trouble in the coming years - Spain, Greece, Portugal.
That said, you are correct - its about making payments and inflation is the great debt equalizer.
Lets hope it kicks in soon.
Still think BTC is more sustainable than Fiat currency.
@_date: 2018-03-12 22:09:44
Yes, true.  However, the effective of increased demand for a product historically absent demand as a major driver of the industry production and tech advancements would receive a major boost to miners seeking to earn a profit.  Thus lowering the cost for renewable technology in the long run.  We're talking last coin minted in 2140.
The energy will continue to grow as the difficulty increases; but that is based on network activity.  The consumption continues to grow because not enough miners are entering the market; as there are excess profits to be had, this is somewhat of a problem.  However, that could easily be chalked up to the combined effect of regulation uncertainty (additional risk) and the barrier to entry (capital requirements).
Ultimately, I think the date of 2140 puts PoW in the right range for establishing a fully free long run financial network established through what is essentially a magnificent script for incentive.
All we have to do is keep the Rothschilds from destroying it with FUD, regulation and ultimately consumption.

@_date: 2018-03-02 00:40:12
No it's not.  You're a tool.  Do a simple Wikipedia search and you'll understand what financial intrinsic value is.

Great point.  Haden't thought about the digital assets gamers need to start reporting; purchased and traded or otherwise.
@_date: 2018-03-12 20:02:55
Yes, that's true.  The PoW algorithm does have the benefit of incentivizing network participation over malicious network action.
The author isn't wrong though, one of the purposes of PoW is to incentivize the advancement of mining tech due to increased demand, creating more value and more relational business among participants which does bring industry stability.  All to the point of producing greater levels of energy through renewable sources which is also incentivized as miners seek to lower costs and thus transaction fees - meaning they are more competitive across the network for mining blocks.
The power consumption of PoW is not a problem.  Its a constraint by design in order to incentivize us to build a fully renewable network.
Personally, that's why I'm not for the Lightning Network.
Good article!
@_date: 2018-03-01 19:48:46
Bitcoin DOES HAVE intrinsic value over fiat currency. 
Why are people who hodl BTC still pitching this shit??
BTC has intrinsic value because it’s a network that replaces, by in large, the required monetary systems, infrastructure and human support of the Fed. 
It’s worth TRILLIONS because of the jobs it takes from the Federal Reserve and FDIC. 
Fiat currency has ZERO intrinsic value. 
Stop saying it doesn’t have intrinsic value if you really don’t understand the financial institutions of the globe or the fractional reserve banking system. Not to mention BTC itself.

@_date: 2018-03-01 20:10:55
I understand that you aren’t understanding, homie.
By solving the double spend problem we don’t need to spend money on paper currency or people to cash checks, make deposits, withdrawals. No cashiers, no bank tellers, no Fed VPs and Chair, no more people needed to allow a fiat currency to work. 
Your paper money had a certain amount of debt attached to it. Debt the system intrinsically requires. 
BTC doesn’t have this constraint and as such is intrinsically valuable when takin into account the money and resources it saves compared to the negative value of fiat currency. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 00:38:53
I have a degree in Finance and Economics. 
Intrinsic value is an actual term that exists in finance and economics outside of what you're describing which is the philosophical notion of intrinsic value.  What I linked was the semantic use I was employing.
"In finance, intrinsic value refers to the value of a company, stock, currency or product determined through fundamental analysis without reference to its market value.[1] It is also frequently called fundamental value. It is ordinarily calculated by summing the discounted future income generated by the asset to obtain the present value. It is worthy to note that this term may have different meanings for different assets."
My entire point is that BTC is intrinsically valuable as it solves issues of cost that currently exist with fiat currency.  By saving money it is valuable.  If you aren't capable of understanding a new perspective try not to push your own uneducated one.

They don’t realize that part of the point of BTC is to force the advancement of technology while incentivizing the construction of an entire network infrastructure - most likely in the future powered only by renewable energy.

Enron created various entities to shuffle around losses while booking future earnings from projects as present revenue.  At the same time they pinned their own company investments to their stock so as the stock rose from inflated estimations so did all the bonuses the employees received in addition to the capital gains from stock options and the what not.
Amazon does the exact same thing except they enter new industries, create high barres to entry through technology innovations, patents and huge war chests.  All for the purpose of booking future revenue as future earnings projected as value into the stock price which is jacked up by Bezos' buddies on Wallstreet who profit insanely from the capital gains. All while Bezos' hides the fact he has his finger in almost every internet outlet or business and controls a huge media empire that is growing in which to push the "retail apocolypse" all while fleecing UPS, USPS and FedEX of billions of dollars of shipping revenue.  
Their original business model was based on not having to pay tax.  That loophole closed several years ago thanks to Texas Comptroller.  Now their business model is divide, conquer, project, jackup price, and keep the spin going.
It will all collapse.  Bezos' is from the largest landowning family in Texas and was in Wall Street when Enron was super hot, he is very familiar with what they did, how they did it and why.
It's all a scam.
