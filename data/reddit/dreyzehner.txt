This is a serious threat to bitcoin businesses which are not taking proper precautions.
Fortunately, this is being solved by the [new Payment Protocol] ( one of the reasons we've worked so hard to move it forward at BitPay.

I'd like to note the difference between centralization and specialization. (In the sense that the bitcoin community uses the words.)
Specialization allows an economy to produce more; centralization constrains it to produce less, but enriches the entities that control production.
A specialized service on top of bitcoin is a good thing- it saves businesses time and money. A centralized service- like a walled garden "ecosystem”- introduces long term resiliency and reliability problems. (Banking system, credit cards.)
There's no reason for TigerDirect or Zynga to internally reinvent bitcoin accounting infrastructure when they can use BitPay's. There is a reason for them to be concerned about building significant infrastructure on a closed platform or account service.
BitPay / Blockchain both work within the open bitcoin protocol- no gatekeepers here. Specialized, not centralized.

I appreciate this sentiment.

You're totally correct- this is almost never a problem. After $100 million+ in volume, strange exceptions tend to show up. I'm just a UX guy, but in my experience some account service providers can be very unreliable and fail to broadcast transactions publicly for days (this is almost always the problem). 
I've also seen problems as wide as cell networks being down temporarily, and the phone wallet unable to rebroadcast the transaction. (BitPay often contacts the service/developer to help them resolve issues discovered.)

Are you implying currencies have varying degrees of currency-ness? An economy's spending patterns are entirely irrelevant in determining the status of its currency as such.

This is a really cool infographic, thanks!
Just wanted to correct a couple of numbers- the graphic says 10 languages and 40 currencies- BitPay actually supports 40 languages and 159 pricing currencies. (You can switch languages at the bottom of the invoice.)

Are you going, @_date: 2014-01-29 02:42:14
Thanks- this is an excellent idea. We've actually followed a similar method for confirmations of very large, accidental transactions.

Hi cdm9002,
Thanks for your comment- just wanted to add- this is actually something solved elegantly by the new Payment Protocol. [BIP 70]( [BIP 72](
For clarity- the problem is with transactions not being relayed by the entire network- typically due to wallet/account errors or lack of a fee. These transactions may take days to reach the whole network. (Monitoring the network is not a computationally hard task, so BitPay doesn’t experience lag or unreliable monitoring in that service.)
While in the short term, our team is able to quickly handle these issues, since we’re extremely focused on ensuring all of the infrastructure we develop on top of bitcoin is open (no walled-gardens), we’re also addressing this issue by promoting and contributing to development of the new Payment Protocol. If you’re interested, you can read about current developments on the [mailing list]( and follow its progress.
@_date: 2014-03-06 19:17:08
Hey, Jason from BitPay here- I just wanted to mention that BitPay doesn't do exchange fees. We are a software as a service company, so our customers simply pay a [monthly price](
Our exchange rates are based on our [Bitcoin Best Bid]( price, so buyers are always receiving the absolute best rate on the market.
Hope that helps!

Have you considered [Bitcore]( Bitcore is [developed and maintained by BitPay]( but is completely open-source.
It's actually not very hard to build bitcoin applications that interact with the real network, rather than a specific company's API.

Hi axedcode,
Jason from BitPay here- I’m really sorry to hear you’re having trouble with a payment. Please note, we take thorough measures to properly verify the owner of sent bitcoin, particularly when sent more than an hour after the invoice expires. (We receive a large number of erroneous and “one-too-many-zeros” payments, which we attempt to return to their proper owners.)
To speed this process, please click the “Request Refund” button on the invoice/receipt, or email support directly. Most emails receive a response within hours, and are resolved immediately.

"The agent led Ulbricht to believe that the killing had been carried out, including sending staged photos of the employee being tortured, and on March 1 Ulbricht wired $80,000 from an account in Australia to an account controlled by authorities."

Does anyone else think it's somewhat odd that the operator of the Silk Road would **wire $80,000 in fiat ~~to~~ from a bank account in Australia** to pay for the first alleged hit? Do people honestly think he decided to **cash out bitcoin into something extremely traceable specifically to pay for a murder-for-hire**? 
Not calling outright conspiracy (as the second alleged hit may be accurately portrayed), but this just seems way out of place.
Don't know what to think about it yet, but I'm really wondering why the murder-for-hire allegations were filed in a separate case in Maryland.
If the murder-for-hire case is thrown out as false, the other one continues, but the damage has already been done to Ross' reputation. I smell a rat.
Edit 2: **Correction:** *From* a bank account in Australia.

I think you're spot on, I'm simply focusing much more on the details- seems this isn't quite there yet.  
The fees are quite a bit higher than most large investors are typically interested in paying (though, perhaps a premium they are willing to pay), and it may still be awhile before the doors open (the site allows until March 2014).
It will certainly be interesting to see how the rest of the financial world digests this news. I imagine this will drive the price speculatively over the next few days, but it still doesn't bring in that new investment, so it seems destined to fizzle out until that money can actually move into a functioning Bitcoin investment vehicle.

By tampering with the properties of the materials inside certain types of hardware, a hardware-level RNG (Random Number Generator) can be made predictable. Without reliable randomness, modern encryption is irrelevant.
TL;DR: Hardware could compromise your encryption undetectably.

Hey Fjordo! As a new bitcoin investor, I'm actually excited that BitPay is liquidating bitcoin on more than one exchange. Not only does it make the whole bitcoin market more liquid (so small investors like me aren't at a disadvantage because we can't get our money to certain exchanges), but it reduces the community's dependency on a single breaking point, like the "exchange of the month."
I'm just a design guy, so I can't speak to the actual formulas, but part of what I like about bitcoin is it's decentralized nature. With so much of my net worth in bitcoin, I would certainly like to see less reliance on a single exchange. :)
@_date: 2013-10-07 18:37:19
BitPay posted an update not long ago: 
I've never seen any discrepancies (or I would simply stop paying via BitPay). Gox is obviously still not taken into account because they are not allowing full withdrawals (see massive price discrepancy).

Right. 
I'm imagining what this business decision now looks like from the perspective of any big-box retailer..
@_date: 2013-10-07 17:44:33
It was a little hard for me to figure out at first, but it makes sense. If you're paying 1 BTC, BitPay finds the best rate you could get for it. If you're paying 100 BTC, BitPay gets the whole orderbook for a ton of exchanges and finds the absolute best price across all of them, and offers it to the user. So it means in practice, if you're paying less the $200,000 in a single transaction, you will probably not even notice [slippage](
@_date: 2013-08-21 18:45:07
That will be a browser/user-agent specific setting- the Bitcoin URI protocol (the "Pay with Bitcoin" button) is a very specific standard defined here: 
The various implementations of the standard on a user's machine is up to the user, and can not be controlled by the Bitcoin URI provider (like BitPay).
I know multibit supports Bitcoin URIs, so you might consider that as an alternative if you're having trouble with your current setup.

BitPay takes the highest bids from a bunch of exchanges, and merges the best price for the amount of bitcoin you're paying.
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:41:23
How many payments would you expect to be receiving? I receive a max of ~5 bitcoin transactions per day to my account (small merchant), and it's actually easier to just manually enter them as they come in than it would be to export/import between all the different services and software I use. 
Even then, If you're bringing in enough to hire a single employee with a credit card based payment system (~$50,000 / month), $300 is still .06% per transaction. I'd have to pay 50x that for credit card payments..

Write your compiler from scratch or use a [countermeasure for "Trusting Trust"]( run on a [CARMA execution environment]( compile from source, and prefer entropy from outside of the computing environment (user input, for example).
TL;DR: Use dice.

This is an honest deal:

SHA256 has definitely not been compromised, though, even if it was, Bitcoin would remain safe until the one-way hash function, RIPEMD-160 was also broken.
Both of these cryptographic functions have had significant time on the open market to be exploited, and have proven to be exceedingly computationally difficult.
We're likely to have a lot of notice before Bitcoiners need to worry about the crypto securing Bitcoin itself.

Existing service is exactly the same. The $0/month starter plan just has the old 1% transaction fee. I'm hoping this means there really is no risk to start accepting bitcoin now.

TL;DR: Great for Bitcoin, not quite the next breakout catalyst.
This is a breaking development for Bitcoin in that it could potentially allow many large, SEC-approved institutional investors to buy into the Bitcoin market without adding additional technical staff, processes, and infrastructure.
It's important to note, however, that this investment vehicle will only be open to [accredited investors]( such that it will still not be possible for most small investors to hold a Bitcoin-tracking asset in a traditional brokerage account. In this respect, the Winklevoss twins' Bitcoin ETF plans are still extremely important to the continuing integration of Bitcoin into the traditional financial ecosystem.
