That username sure is relevant.

I really don't care if the story is valid or not. I'm merely explaining why people are suspicious, which happens a ton in subs involved with real money. Also the validity of the story doesn't make OP any less of a giant hypocrite. 
Also, no offense, but your word means very little since you're not a mod here. You just seem to be some guy copy pasting replies. Honestly, I've never been to this sub but the amount of drama here is hilarious. Who gives a shit if people believe him or not? And just because he sent you a pic of his son (who in all likelihood wrote a paper on BTC) doesn't mean he's not lying about this interaction with the principal. I mean look at the conversation, does it look like normal human interaction to you?

You have a strange way of taking the high road.

Normally, I wouldn't care, but I really dislike hypocrites. You say you'll take the high road and ask everyone to stop flaming, but then you directly insult users in an extremely childish fashion:


Honestly, that's a grade school level insult, that's the kind of shit I expect to hear on COD.
What you need to understand is that people don't like giving money to liars/scammers. If people think that you are running some sort of BS scam they are going to call you out and ask for proof (see example: white kid who pretends to be a poor minority to get Disney money on kickstarter). This story you've presented is not exactly going to sate anyone's appetite since it looks like it's from a sitcom.
**tl:dr** People are not automatically required to believe your story especially when money is involved. Don't condescend to people saying you won't sink to their level then sink to their level afterward.
