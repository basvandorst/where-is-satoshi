They have been highly ranked at  (you can buy their card via lightning) but I have heard some concerns from users that you need to trust their private key generation mechanism is safe&amp;honest. Hard for people that are not from Austria to judge how trustworthy they are.
@_date: 2019-07-31 13:22:08
There is a difficulty adjustment every 14 days, so I think you should keep it to more than 14 days, around 40 days I would say. Also, to decrease fluctuation you should maybe average it with the target 10 minutes. So something like:
Average block time = 10 minutes * 0.5 + average_block_time_past_40_days * 0.5
 uses the average block time of the past 180 days, which led it to estimate ~ April 20th 2020 during much of 2018, so this is why I suggest an average towards towards 10 minutes.

the default of 1 sat/B `minrelayfee` makes it very hard for transactions that pay less than 1 sat/B to get transmitted across the network. How did you manage to get this one through? Are you connected to a network of nodes that broadcast sub 1 sat/B transactions?

If you want to support lightning payments (which would save you time later changing to a processor that supports it when it becomes more popular), check out coingate, opennode and globee (all these are custodial but I think you can schedule payouts). If you have high volume of payments and want to avoid the ~1% fee of these processors, use BTCpay.

Hate to break the "good news" but as pointed out, the problem here is that the IRR is not a freely traded currency. You can't go to your broker and trade IRR, there are capital controls. The official conversion rate is therefore meaningless like in Venezuela.
IRR/USD is not the 0,000024 google says but much lower. It is in fact 0.00000583. This can be seen in the website gave: 
Careful because in this website, prices are in Iranian Toman (1 Toman = 10 Rials)

Transactions that are not replaceable can also pop out of the mempool if they depend on replaceable transactions btw. It's not enough to check if the incoming transaction is replaceable but to also check if it depends on any replaceable transaction from the merchant point of view.

Or just a pruned node... it's also not a bad idea, no?
I think the main problem when you start running a full node is that you can easily corrupt the blockchain and you need to restart the whole process all over again. I corrupted it like three times before I learned that I had to use `bitcoin-cli stop` to correctly stop the node on `bitcoind`.

Not sure I understand it neither... I think someone betted $2,344,883 that bitcoin would go down from $15239 and his position got liquidated (he lost all his money). Due to 100x leverage I think he only lost $23,448.83

@_date: 2018-09-13 20:14:47
this exploit also affects bitcoin... 
also, you don't even need to go that far, simply send a replaceable transaction and after the merchants accepts, replace that transaction with another one with an higher fee (RBF, replace-by-fee) that pays to yourself...
payment processors/wallets can improved to detect this kind of attacks I suppose, so if this becomes common, wallets can adapt.
@_date: 2018-09-28 17:56:19
I will take advantage of this post to ask you this: I heard you were planning to add a feature to allow transactions to be broadcasted via SMS. If the user if offline, he would be able to copy the raw transaction, paste it in a SMS and send to a number that would then broadcast the transaction. While I don't expect you provide the broadcast from SMS service, are thinking about adding the option to copy the raw transaction?

I see... I don't know if bitcoin core 0.17 will bring any improvement to this... is your code efficiently looping through the `txids`? For how many blocks do you want this info?
The fastest solution might be to actually use the API of a block explorer and not bitcoin core :P
Post here the stack exchange question if you ask anything there, I am interested in the answer.
@_date: 2018-09-17 19:02:52
Mentor Monday on the first page!? something must be wrong...
How can it be checked in real-time if there is an "accidental fork", or, in order words, if there are two competing blocks at the same height? In retrospective I can see it here  , but I want something in real time. Would bitcoin core give me two hashes if I do 
`bitcoin-cli get getblockhash $(bitcoin-cli getblockcount)`?
Is there a way to get this from `debug.log`? If so, can someone give me the exact text I should look for?
Using an external API is fine, as long as it's fairly reliable.
@_date: 2018-09-13 13:34:15
Also interested in this. You want to store the raw transaction or the decoded transaction? If you want the decoded transaction in the end you can do `bitcoin-cli getblock &lt;hash&gt; 2` . By setting the verbosity to 2 it automatically decodes every transaction in the block.
It's probably best to ask in the bitcoin stack exchange...

I think you should look at  , and learn from their mistakes. I think the main weakness of coinmap is that is hard to delist a venue, some venues don't accept bitcoin and are still there, it's hard to flag venues as "not accepting anymore". I would suggest you import all ~13k venues on coinmap.org (they have a really good API for this) and then let people automatically flag something as "not accepting anymore". If a store is flagged three times as not accepting anymore, remove it and automatically send an email to the merchant warning they were delisted... 
Also, add a flag whether the merchant accept lightning payments or not, this will be useful for the coming years and I could use this information to integrate the store into the website I maintain

If you use a reasonable position and the is going down, you can add margin, so you never actually lose 100%. If the price goes up by 50% you get 33% bitcoin profit, excellent, you never get bitcoin profit by just hodling.
I think it makes sense to get some Bitmex long position as long as the size is reasonable and the trader is ready to add margin in the extreme case bitcoin goes to $3k

This is exactly what bitcoin needs! I have a full time job but on the weekends I try to find ways to contribute to bitcoin. I have created this website that lists stores that accept bitcoin through lightning: 
Github here: 
Pull requests are welcome. It would be very helpful to integrate a map into the website... The website is written in javascript (although I am a beginner and much was done with the help of pull requests) and I also wrote a python script that checks for new lightning stores (it's on the repo). I also have a reddit crawler (which is not there) that logs new stores mentioned in the comments and title. This crawler has been turned off because sometimes it gets shuts down on the cloud machine I don't know why (I was using pythonanywhere.com )... 
I also had another idea for a project of bitcoin transaction fee estimation. There are fee estimation tools out there (you can find some of them listed in lopp.net/bitcoin.html) but I think they could be much better...
@_date: 2018-05-02 20:55:32
Thanks for doing this! The day you release this app will be a big step for lightning as it will be the first iOS app! Will it also accept lightning payments or just send like eclair?
Also, can you give me a heads up before posting on reddit about the release? I would like to check if there is any new store that accepts lightning and update the repository:  , I am the maintainer of the repository (

Hi, "Savory Eats" was there already but it was not being shown by default as it had a size set to "small". I changed this default as it was causing some confusion. Now every store will appear by default... You can find it easily just by changing the sector filter to "food". The idea of this filter is just for people to get a quick feel of which big merchants are accepting bitcoin through lightning as there are many of them right now (34 at least). I might remove this later in the future as this it's quite difficult to judge the size of a store and it might be a bit unfair to judge... But anyway, I would like to have this there too as it's useful... Like for bitcoin the big merchants would be microsoft, overstock and expedia, that's good to know..
@_date: 2018-05-14 01:22:54
It's always a good exercise to create a website, but it's a bit unnecessary as there are already better tools:

Every public key is found from its private key (an irreversible process called elliptic curve multiplication). The private key could belong to the miner itself (unlikely, unless it's a really big miner) or the mining pool. The mining pool takes a cut (around 2%) of the mining reward (12.5 BTC per block now) and the rest is distributed to the miners of the mining pool proportionally to the work (hashes) they did.

How can you claim that a trader could have made 21% this week? In hindsight, you caould have made 99999999%, by buying at every microdip and selling at every micro pump...
 I think most people here critize you because you are focusing on the trading aspect of bitcoin instead of the technology and its potencial to positively impact everyday life. However if instead of fueling the speculative mania you are teaching that people can buy a tiny fraction of a bitcoin, that hardforks are bad but they give you equal amount of the forked coin so its not a real dilution , that confirmation times are subjective and should be adjusted to the amount sent (ie if you sell a house you probably should wait 10 confirmations vs coffe where a pending transaction is enough), ...  than your work is appreciated

Thank you for what you contributed to bitcoin. But, may I ask, why didn't you donate most of that money to bitcoin projects like lightning, bitcoin core, Samurai wallet, mimblewimble, to increase bitcoin adoption? Bitcoin in itself stands for financial inclusion and protection from hyperinflation.

If you want to buy bitcoin with USD you can use Coinbase/GDAX, Bitstamp or Kraken.

I can change the default to be "all" stores, yes. But many stores have really no traffic at all or only sell like one T-shirt, I think it would be best to filter a bit by default, but this can always be changed of course.
EDIT: changing the default size size is really easy, I just need to change like two lines of code. If someone else also prefers to see all site by default please say something.

Best answer. Either that, or you ask the person who is receiving the money to make a child transaction with the output that you sent him,  that pays to himself and has a very high fee. This requires the receiving party to be very tech savvy.

First of all, I think it's important to understand where Python stands among other programming languages. Python is a very good language for quick scripts, data visualization and, in general, for any project below 3000 lines of code (this 3000 value is not scientific at all, it's more like a personal preference). In contrast, java, C# and C++ are more verbose and safe languages that are generally better choices for larger projects. In technical jargon, java/C are strongly typed languages and python is weakly typed. For now don't worry much about this, just be aware that if you are planning a big project project, think twice before choosing Python, you might deeply regret it later when the code is hard to maintain, refactor and debug.
The answer varies a lot whether you are learning to program for the first time or are mostly moving from another language to python. If you already programmed before I would simply look at a cheat sheet like [this one]( and start right away.
If you never programmed before, I think the best way to learn is to have an idea of something you want to do, something that is meaning to yourself or simply for fun. The challenge of coding something new and the pleasure of finishing it - sometimes after endless attempts - is what gets you hooked. At least this is how I learned. For example, while in school we had a lot of multiple choice questions in tests and sometimes I choose randomly, so I made a program to my graphing calculator (TI-84) that randomly chooses an answer (A, B, C or D). A mix of fun and usefulness is what I try to aim for, here you need to get a bit creative sometimes, and it might take some time to find something good enough but it's worth IMO. Alternatively, look for exercises and try to solve them.
Getting started
You should start by installing [python]( (dahh).  Check python installation by opening a terminal (cmd in windows) and typing `py`, `python` or `python3` and see if you don't get an error. Try to run `print('Hello World')`. I would suggest to install three important python libraries that I use a lot at this point, but it's optional: `pandas`, `numpy` and `requests`. Run `pip install &lt;libraryName&gt;` or `py -m pip install &lt;libraryName&gt;` to install each library. Then install an IDE (an application with GUI that helps you to code). You can use for example Pycharm. Now on the editor of the IDE you can start coding by creating a `.py` file and putting you code in it. If you make an obvious error the IDE will mark it and you find it quicker than if you just try to run `python myScript.py` on the terminal.
Now that you are set up, just try to code your idea. You really don't need much "vocabulary" to start coding, the only words/structures you need to know to code almost anything are 'if...else' and 'while'. Here is an example of how to get the price of bitcoin from GDAX every 4 seconds and prints a notification when the price changes more than 0.1%:
    import requests
    import time
    
    # pause for getting GDAX price
    speed_in_seconds = 4
    
    # function that gives the GDAX price
    def get_price_GDAX():
        answer = requests.get('
        answer_parsed = answer.json()
    
        ask_price = answer_parsed['asks'][0][0]
        ask_price = float(ask_price)
    
        bid_price = answer_parsed['bids'][0][0]
        bid_price = float(bid_price)
    
        return (ask_price + bid_price) / 2
    
    start_price = get_price_GDAX()
    
    # loop during one hour, constantly checking and updating the price
    has_run_seconds = 0
    while has_run_seconds &lt; 60*60:
        current_price = get_price_GDAX()
    
        if abs((current_price - start_price)/start_price) &gt; 0.001:
            print('Price has changed! New price=' + str(current_price))
            start_price = current_price
        else:
            print('Price hasn\'t changed much')
    
        time.sleep(speed_in_seconds)
        has_run_seconds = has_run_seconds + speed_in_seconds    
Try to understand the basic logic of this code like you were a computer. Computers are really dumb and only do what they are told. When you code, you have to think the same way.

This "mule.tools" project from Samurai is a good idea, and I find the SMS broadcast especially useful. The other day I wanted to make a bitcoin transaction but I had no access to mobile internet on my smartphone. There is a repository with a software that encodes and decodes the bitcoin raw transactions via SMS - [PonyDirect](
However, AFAIK sending a simple SMS with the raw transaction without encoding is not yet possible. If I ever have some free time I would do a pull request to PonyDirect adding this possibility to send and received bitcoin raw transactions without encoding. I think it's the most practical way to do it, since if you are offline you won't be able to install a software that encodes the raw transaction. This is also a good task for anyone that knows Java and wants to contribute to bitcoin.
Please correct me if it's possible to send the raw transaction without encoding it.
PS: Now I see that there is a new [release]( Is it possible to broadcast via SMS now with only SamuraiWallet?

These empty blocks are purposely made to increase the fees. These empty blocks are created after regular pauses of several minutes: 
Doesn't Bitmain also run BTC.com? BTC.com is behaving "well"... Right now antPool has 14.3% of the hashrate, I wonder how much will it have in the coming weeks after this genius idea /s

If you receive a payment through lightning, you have to make sure the person that sent you the money doesn't cheat. You have to "watch" after yourself, by being online every day. Otherwise, the person that sent you money might claim back the money that you thought he had paid to you, like with a double spend attack. 
However, with watchtowers, other people can "watch" these payments for you, and you don't need to worry about receiving payments through lightning. It's a big step to lightning adoption. Of course, things still need to be tested and given time for people to set up this service, probably it won't be noticed for some time... I wonder when the first guide to setup a watchtower will pop out.

I think each chinese individual has a $50K quota to pull out of the country per year. In two years you might be able to take that money out. Get some chinese you trust, transfer him a few thousand dollars worth of Yuan, ask him to transfer out of the country or buy bitcoin with it and then transfer to you. Pay him a small fee for helping you. Alternatively I think you can go to Shenzen, withdraw cash, travel to Hong Kong and deposit the money in a Hong Kong bank, which is not controlled.
There is a market for mainland chine Yuan (CNY) and offshore chinese Yuan (CNH). The offshore chinese yuan is worth 0.2% more than the mainland chinese yuan, if I am not mistaken.

I found many professional programmers that hate math. It really depends on what you are coding. If you do machine learning, you definitely need math, or if you are simulating some real phenomenon and you need to solve differential equations, ... Generally, it's more about logical thinking, creating abstractions of real life things so the computer can "understand it" and good organization of the code so when you read it one year later, you still understand it.
Look into object oriented programming if you are interested.

I don't see why not. Better yet, you can set up a node in a desktop that watches constantly over your smartphone wallet. Haven't a smartphone wallet watch over another smartphone wallet doesn't seem a very good idea.

Hey, I just had this idea today and maybe you would like to work on. It would be really cool to have a world map where each country is colored according to its currency. Then on top of the country it would be written the exchange(s) with most volume for that country/region (or best candidate(s) for first place). 
Example: 
USA &gt; Gemini, Coinbase
Euro zone &gt; Kraken
Brazil &gt; Mercado Bitcoin
Chile, Colombia, Peru &gt; Buda.com
South Africa, &gt; Luno
Uganga &gt; Bitcoin Uganda
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Emirates, Oman &gt; Rain (coming in 2019)
You can see the exchange per currency in cryptocompare (
Then post it on , and post your address for donations. I would tip if it looks good and complete. It helps to know which exchanges one might use if one travels/relocates to another country. Some people might not like it because it leads to exchange centralization, but I think it helps to have liquidity in markets that would have none otherwise. If you don't get donations, at least you get some fame and get more demand for your work.
Had this idea when I saw this two new exchanges: Rain and Bitcoin Uganda coming to regions that had no major bitcoin exchange.
Just an idea...

I lived in Portugal during the "escudos" period and I don't need a wikipedia article to tell me about it. Yes, inflation was high but interest rates for having money sitting in the bank were equally high so the economy was nowhere near collapse. Over many years inflation made those denominations worthless but who cares if money in the bank is (partially) protected from inflation. I am telling you, the portuguese escudo was not a failed currency. You may want to keep it on your list but you are being biased towards fiat currency failures.

It's not money that you couldn't access, the interest rate on a normal bank account would be very high. You could withdraw at any moment. 


Salaries and contracts are a very good point. I know someone who was receiving several rents from portuguese apartments and these rents became very low over time because, according to law, the rent couldn't increase anually more than a certain fixed rate which turned out to be lower than the inflation rate. After some years, the people ended up paying a very low rent and the contract could not be terminated because they were old... But again, here the problem was with the law/contract and not with inflation by itself.
Anyway, my point is, if a currency that had an interest rate of 3% in its last years and that stopped being used because it was replaced by a more widely used currency is considered a "failure" then I am not interested in reading the list the OP posted. Yes, there was high inflation during some years but not enough to be considered "failed". If that is enough, than we might consider bitcoin to be "failed" because it had very high inflation in 2014 and 2015...

Using BTCpay is basically free as you don't use any intermediary, they also do fiat conversion I think but I think you will need to setup a corporate account with an exchange (ex Bitstamp, coinbase, kraken, ...). 
One option is to start with a payment processor and pay their fees and then if the payment volume in crypto becomes big, switch to BTCpay.

As the main developer/maintainer of the website, I am worried they are not 100% legit. See this thread here:
It seems like they can take more than 24h to send the giftcards that were bought through them, which makes it suspicious but I would like to know, in the coming days, if anyone has any bad experiences.
I hope openNode has done some background check on them before accepting them.
Hopefully someone downvotes it a lot, if not really legit, or else, I will remove it.

Like the redesign, this feature was a long-time coming. It makes the content of the website much more dynamic and it can provide much more information than available on the description. 
We had some people come to us and tell us “how is this store so high up? It shouldn’t be there because of XYZ”. This gives users the possibility to express that anger by leaving a negative comment ��. Or it gives them the possibility to positive comments of course, like sharing discount codes, favorite products, previous experiences, how long it takes to ship, etc. Reviews can be agreed upon/reinforced and the reviews with the highest scores (in absolute value) go to the top. The votes used on reviews count towards the total score of the store, so it gives an optional “extra” functionality to regular voting. You can sort by "Last commented" on the website to see which are the latest comments.
Some other improvements we made: website loads faster and night mode.

It's a layer on top of bitcoin that allows you to do bitcoin payments without having to pay transactions fees because the payments are not registered in the blockchain. Think of it like a filter, small transactions are done in the lightning network are not settled in the blockchain, big transactions get settled in the blockchain the traditional way..

As someone mentioned, go for a payment processor that accepts lightning, it's still not very used but it will probably be much more in the future and you will avoid having to change payment processor later.
Some payment processors that have integrated lightning: coingate, openNode, globee, coinpayments (integrated this week I think). They all take roughly 1% of the transacted amount.
If you want to accept bitcoin directly (bit more work) try BTCpay.
These processors are probably best for online shops, you might want to try with a regular wallet first

It had been a couple months since I developed anything new for  so I decided to add some features.
When I introduced payments on the website in July 2018, there were many people voting small amounts, which was great and was the purpose of the website to give the "general" opinion of what are the best stores. As time went by, however, most votes came from large merchants and I thought that some good websites were not given enough attencion because their makers didn't want to agressively advertise. In order to balance things out and incentivise the average bitcoin user to vote on the website, I added two features:
1 - Trending websites. Websites that get voted fast get visibility by being tagged as trending and by being listed in the new Statistics page:  . If you want to know how the trending score is calculated check the FAQ at 
2 - A funny tool to "get a taste" of lightning. I am referring to the button that says "Try a random lightning venue!" at the end of  . This button will open the website of a venue that accepts lightning chosen randomly, but the higher the score of the website the higher the probability the venue will be chosen. By default, it will only open venues that will give you something back instantly after you pay, so no stores that ship goods. You can change this default behaviour and play around with many more options in the "Advanced options".
Finally, something that was asked many times, I added a graph with how many merchants are accepting lightning over time. I just noticed we passed 200 stores! Comparing with the data from coinmap.org I am surpriced to see that, last month, the ratio of stores that accept bitcoin to the stores that accept bitcoin through lightning is almost 20%!
As usual, any suggestions are welcome. I am planning to allow the store owners to automatically change the information about themselves based on the ownership of the website. For example ZigZag exchange could change their information my clicking a confirmation link sent to admin

I think lightning chess hasn't gotten the attention it deserves. The website looks amazing and it's a very cool use of lightning. 
If more people are planning to play and want to get partners, they can upvote Lightning Chess at  (1000 satoshis is probably enough), this will trigger the website to be tweeted on the new twitter account  That will make it easier to find partners by sharing game links on the tweet thread.

Yes, you will pay a transaction fee for every time you open a channel. If you have a channel open for a year and make ~10 transactions per day, you will do pay one transaction fee for 3000 transactions. The transaction fee becomes irrelevant but yes, its there.

1 -  I would like to contribute to bitcoin but I am very time-poor. I think the best way for me to contribute to the ecosystem is to donate to projects/teams that are making huge steps towards adoption, for example, by tackling bitcoin's scalability or creating very good wallets or resources. However, it's hard to find projects/teams that are good but are also in high need for capital. Is there a website or some other resource that helps to choose good projects to donate to?
2 - Is there a website where people can vote with their bitcoin (voting right is proportional to bitcoin balance)? Something like this infamous [website](

You are lucky because yesterday, the [beta version of lnd]( was released, however I would not call this "easy". It will take you several hours, especially if you don't run a bitcoin node and have to wait to download the blockchain.
If you just want to try the technology, you should use the testnet.
The fastest way would be to use this [web lightning wallet]( and spend some testnet bitcoin in one of the [testnet stores](
Another way would be to install the [lightning app from lightning labs]( on your desktop.
On your android you can try [Eclair] (
These last three options that I mentioned use the testnet. As of today, I am not aware of an "easy" way for non-technical users to try the bitcoin lightning mainnet. This will probably change in the coming months.

Bitcoin has a maximum block size of 1 Mb, and as there is only a block around every 10 minutes, this means that the maximum frequency of transactions is about 7 transactions/second. To solve this problem (scaling debate) the bitcoin community has come with several solutions but by far the most popular one is the lightning network. 
The lightning network allows for people to transact bitcoin without registering every transaction in the blockchain, it acts like a "filter" or second-layer, like some people call it. It is still in it's infancy. You can experiment with it in the bitcoin testnet for several months now and about one or two months ago, the mainnet went live. Very few people are using it because it's still experimental but people expect it to grow as the software is fully tested and the demand for bitcoin transactions increases. With the lightning network, it will be possible to make thousands of transactions per second, more than with Visa. You can see the lightning network in the mainnet here  and the testnet here

If you want to feel better, I know someone who lost $100k in leveraged trading. If you use leverage, you need to use very little compared to the volatility of what you are trading.
You haven't lost that money though, because bitcoin is now cheaper and you can more easily acumulate it. Take advantage to acumulate some cheap bitcoin now. Only when it goes back $10k you will be defeated.
@_date: 2018-07-07 21:08:24
Totally agree with OP's view that spending is important. First time I bought bitcoin was to use it in fiverr.com.  I think the bottom in bitcoin's price will be related to its utility as a means of payment. We will see with lightning how much bitcoin can scale and good a means of payment it can be. I have received more than 200 payments in my website ( at virtually no cost and without taking any space in the blockchain, I think we have empirical evidence that bitcoin can be a better means of exchange than traditional systems. Lightning just needs to be more user friendly and higher capacity, that will come with watchtowers and atomic multipath

You have to design your contest in a way that earns the trust of strangers and I am just pointing out things that make people shout scam. As you can see, this is vide of your audience here and it's not me that is being pessimistic.
* You missed the point about the price. It's all about verifying your metric. You came up with some convoluted price index that would take me hours of work to write a piece of code to verify the price that you will choose as the winning price. If you used a price index from a regulated market, like for example the CME bitcoin futures, it would be easy for me to verify the winning price: 
CME bitcoin futures is just an example of a trustable source, you can choose another one. The point is that participants should be able to verify your winning price by consulting (a) third-party website(s) and do nothing more than a back-of-the-envelope calculation.
* It's not about whether if it's a mathematical, bitcoin, biology, astronomy or literature based question. It's about the fact that you can easily choose a question that only you/your family/your friends know the answer to and still call it a skill-based question.
* About the refunding, it would be much easier to do it with bitcoin. A script that refunds 40k+ persons in bitcoin can be written in a matter of hours while doing it manually which would take you weeks. This has nothing to do with the way people are paying, as they can pay with paypal but be refunded with bitcoin.

Bitpay doesn't have a very good reputation within the bitcoin community. Like suggested, use lightning! Be patient though because lightning is still in its infancy.. Besides coingate, other payment processors that you can use are [Globee]( [OpenNode]( You can also try BTCpay and Strike (from acinq) but these probably require more time to setup.

Regarding your second question, do you mean merchants that don't rely on a payment processor? One way is to go to their website and see on their checkout page, if their checkout page is a template that mentions the name of the processor, they are using it. Another way is to look at the node URI. Many recent nodes have the same node URI because they are all using CoinGate, it's the URI of CoinGate. The older the store the more likely to be processing the payments themselves.

I think this is due mostly to support by the payment processors OpenNode, GloBee and especially, CoinGate. I spent $60 in bitgild the other day, because they were offering a free 1oz bitcoin silver coin for the first 20 purchases with lightning above $50. These first 20 purchases were made fast and they alone accounted for 1% of the network capacity (apr. $60*20 ~ 0.2 BTC). If you look at[ CoinGate's node capacity]( you see that it is 0.7 BTC now, which is alone is 2% of the network capacity now. 
I am working on adding lightning stores faster to the reposity:  , things are growing so fast that I need to improve the process. Last week there were about 20 new stores.

Why don't you just use the settlement price of the CME bitcoin futures for the 3rd of January. Even if you need to convert to CAD, do it, but use veriable source like the settlement for price for the Canadian Currency future for that day. Why come up with some fishy average that is not clear and harder to trust? Use a easily verifiable metric, not some convoluted formula that only you have access to. If you insist on an price in a given instant, then use the closing price for the CME bitcoin future...
Here is a bitcoin "skill based question": how many fee bumps did I do on the transaction da8004fa413e27111ed33b1f3da1d67432667f41a3d68a09404dbe4b57d4dcb9? What, you don't know?

There is also a need for people to test and give feedback to the lightning wallets that are being released: 
Check on  if there is a bitcoin store near you and ask if they accept bitcoin through lightning or ask stores that don't even accept bitcoin (usually eletronic stores, stores run by young people and stores that deal with tourists are more open to it). 
Note that accepting payments through lightning is still a bit dangerous because if you receive a payment and you go offline for one day or more, it's possible that someone steals the money that they paid you before. You should pay attention to the next major release of lnd v0.5 ( which will implement watchtowers. These will make receiving bitcoin through lightning much safer.

I think for $100 the likelihood of a payment failing is quite high but it depends on many factors like how many large channels with more than $100 do you have open, how big is the node you are paying to and does it have more than $100 inward capacity in a single channel? You can try to guess the answer to the last question by looking at an explorer like this one: 
I have a website that tracks stores that accept bitcoin through lightning   and also tracks other things like mobile wallets

I bought a very small amount of bitcoin for the first time in November 2015 to use it in  . I was not speculating, I was using it because it was a borderless currency that was cheaper than using paypal. Unfortunately it wasn't until many months later that I started paying attention to it and bought more as an investment. So, I would say that a big part of what I hold is an investment but I also hold it because it's a good cross-border currency (especially with lightning now). 
Other ways to make money with bitcoin is to have a business that accepts bitcoin and mining. Although it doesn't make much money, I can give you my site as an example 
You can make small bitcoin payments through lightning (it's a complex subject, look up the basics, here is an explorer  If you have an android phone, install eclair or bitcoin lightning wallet (links here  and try it.

Read the information on the website. Many things seem a bit off:
* No clear tie-breaker, eg. someone bets 9999.99 and someone else 10000.01 and the final price is 10000.00
* Prediction of the price is in BTC/CAD not BTC/USD. BTC/CAD is less liquid and easier to manipulate than BTC/USD.
* Price is the average of Kraken's BTC/CAD, bitcoin average and Bitstamp's BTC/USD converted to BTC/CAD. First of all, bitcoin average is not an exchange, they derive their CAD price mostly from Kraken, so it's effectively putting two-thirds of the weight on Kraken's BTC/CAD pair. What is worse is that the organizer might know Bitcoin's average website owner and change the price a little bit to their advantage. Openexchangerates.org which is used to convert price from BTC/USD to BTC/CAD updates only every hour, and is a paid API, giving the organizer some room to change a bit this parameter.
* Even if someone guesses correctly, the contestant has to answer a ''skill-testing question". Scam alert.
* The contest will not occur if there are less than 50 000 participants, so you have to trust they are willing to go through the hassle of returning manually the $10 entry fee up to 49 999 people.

hi Jongbin, it depends on what you want to do... If you want to build an explorer, a routing algorithm, ... you should probably setup a lightning node. There is no major lightning implementation in python but you can use lnd (written in Go -  for example. The other two major implementations are eclair (Scala) and c-lightning (C).
If you just want to receive payments you can use a payment processor that typically charges 1%. Popular ones are coingate, open node, globee and strike (from acinq).
You can always get tons of help in the lnd slack.
PS: thanks for your email this morning.

also think that are very few stores. with the exponential growth of bitcoin, I would expect the number of stores accepting it to also grow exponentially. it doesn't count online stores though. 
I also hope a lot of stores come with lightning. so far... I created a repository of lightning stores ( so far about 20 stores, most of them online. Would like to find someone to help run the website as I don't have much free time... 
@_date: 2018-04-27 00:18:28
Thanks, I do what I can to help bitcoin... unfortunately I have little free time due to my full time job and this website is the best I can do. Initially, I could discover some new stores fairly quickly by getting getting node names and checking which are working websites (check python script in repository). I was thinking about creating a reddit crawler in python, using [PRAW]( that logs posts/comments that mention "lightning" and "accept"/"support"/... to discover new stores...
I feel like running a lightning node is a big barrier for most businesses. Will it be possible to accept lightning payments without running a node? For example, just by running this [wallet app]( (when it's released for mainnet). 
@_date: 2018-04-26 19:45:32

EDIT2: after checking each store listed here and on the website I found that only 9bravos is missing, but that one is under maintenance temporarily... I thought that all stores that had BTC pay integrated could accept lightning but apparently this is not true because the store itself needs to run it's own lightning node.

do you a txid for an advert before the fork? Would like to take a look in my node to see how this is done...
EDIT Is it the same way satoshi encoded "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks"

You have to give yourself some upvotes otherwise it's burried and most people will only find it by sorting by newest.

Whats the txid of the advert?

Great! Here is a list of stores where you can spend your bitcoin with lightning: 
If you know a store that is not listed there, please add it to the [github]( or send me a PM with it.

I completely agree with your point of view. Businesses either need to find a sustainable business model, which is very hard in bitcoin or need to rely on donations. Only projects with very competent and passionate members like lightning labs, bitcoin core, samurai wallet, ... can survive on donations. Even Andreas Antonopoulos was having financial difficulties some weeks ago, before receiving $2MM in donations. 
In order for bitcoin to thrive, I think people should donate a small portion (say, 3%) of the money invested or earned with bitcoin. If this is not done, we won't stop having scammy ICOs and useless ERC20 tokens. I wish there was a website where people could ask funding for bitcoin-related projects.
There are several websites that list non-profit organizations that people can donate bitcoin too, like [this]( and [this]( But bitcoin needs is a directory of bitcoin-related projects that accept bitcoin donations. Let's create one. I will gladly pay for the website registration, hosting and a small budget for development of this website.
PM me if you are interested in doing this.

I can fit many more on my screen, both desktop and mobile. Which smartphone/browser are you using?
EDIT: ok, you are right :P, on desktop you can only fit 5, had not realized this because initially there were very few stores... Will try to decrease the size of the titles and maybe remove line breaks...

yes... I found a store once that doesn't accept bitcoin and it's still there... only administrators can remove them and not many people bother sending an email to report it...

good idea, I was not aware of the Airbitz list. Regarding filtering by location, that's something I thought about adding. I have a full-time job though and don't have much time to do it.

Hi, I am the maintainer of the github repository for the website. Thanks for posting but next time, please send me an email or PM so we avoid double posting.
I just finished adding some new stores and filtering options and ended up posting more or less at the same time :P

Also looking for collaborators that would like to contribute to the website and have push access.
Note: The website doesn't show by default small stores.

You can sort by newest and just add the new ones to your count... but I will add a count, sure :) was planning to add it along with a plot of  stores over time.

wow... just realized they fix 1 USDT = 1 USD and they treat them as equals, even for withdrawls and deposits.
@_date: 2018-04-17 16:10:42
That's the point of the lightning network, once you are connected to one person, you are connected to the whole network. For now, though, you can only send payments with eclair, not receive payments, because to receive funds you have to monitor the channels once at least once per day to make sure you don't get hacked. These might change later with watchtowers...

This was a long time coming, to make the [website]( look nicer on desktop and mobile. Finally we release the new design made with vue.js and open sourced in our [github repository](
An important new feature is that website owners are now able to update their own information on the site by verifying by clicking a link sent to the administrator email address (eg. admin or by making a change in their DNS. With this change, the website becomes a fully automated repository, where adding and updating entries is done automatically. Only eventual deletions need to be done manually now.
Some other updates are the search bar, two new sectors and an HTML snippet that stores can embed in their website so users can review them.
Soon we will add the possibility to comment on the stores, let us know if there is any improvement you would like us to do.

I don't see any obstacle.
advisors - you have here thousands of them
accountant - why would you need one? If you want to pay taxes on the crypto ATM profits, just declare your profits in your tax return
the point of bitcoin is that you don't need to ask permission
EDIT: if you really want an accountant for this, maybe contact the other bitcoin ATM operators in Portugal ( and see how they do it.

As other people mentioned, the channel doesn't close until you say so and if you route those payments to Starbucks you can then use Dave's channel to pay to Starbucks or if he is not well connected, you can received more funds via Starbucks. Also, you may choose not to advertise the channel for routing.
Something that I think others have not mentioned is that you can set a high routing fee, so that when you route that 1 BTC, you earn, say 5 mBTC, which should be more than enough to close and open a new channel.

If an employee knows which transaction paid him, then he can explore the blockchain to find out (and maybe it will be even in the same transaction) how much others got paid. It suffices for one employee to reveal this/have this information stolen.
I don't think there is anything wrong with knowing each other's salary but knowing this might promote a more vertical structure which might be undesirable.

It's a simple yet original service that will help with adoption. As I think it will be hard to maintain an open-source project with donations, I plan to keep it closed-source and try to get some business costumers. My main advantage will then be first to market, and that's why I prefer to keep it secret for now. It will take me some more weeks/months  to finish a demo and then I will make it public. Unfortunately software development usually takes more time than people initially estimate so don't want to give a specific date...
EDIT: I can PM you when it announce it if you want.

The most transactions I have seen in a block is around 3500 but let's say we could fit 10000. There are about 50 000 blocks/year which corresponds to 500milion transactions/year. Even if all transactiins were lightning channel openings, it would take 14 years to onboard 7 billion persons and that's an optimistic estimate. So I can see how other people can arrive at 40 years...
Most people can't or don't want to learn about bitcoin/lightning so most likely the way to onboard everyone will be through custodial services like coinbase and this one:  by u/Eiprol
I am not saying I am a fan of this custodial services but I think it's how it's going to evolve...
