Of course the videos are always user specific but they were not all "1 Bitcoin make you a millionaire" videos until the Theil story started the pimping.
You can't see the huge pump going on across all main stream media? Perhaps you don't want to see it.
I could be wrong but I think Bitcoin will correct to under $5K. That's 75% off a $20K high. This recent move up could very well be a trap. Bitcoin is showing weakness already as I type this-- 14.6k and falling.

I invested in GBTC and it was so stressful. I have no doubt crypto is here to stay but *which coin* out of the literally hundreds of alt-coins will actually be used and dominate the sector? I have no F'ing clue. I came to the conclusion that it ain't going to be Bitcoin with its ridiculous transaction fees and low speed though. 
So I dumped that GBTC pig (small gain) and bought Canadian weedstocks instead. Alt-Marijuana will never exist. Feel so much better now.
I can easily imagine Bitcoin trending to zero. Marijuana--no way in my mind. Peace.

In theory, Bitcoin could work.
But leave it to humans to create a thousand alts that only destroy Bitcoin's value. Worse than printing fiat now. We just can't leave a good idea alone. 
There's a reason gold has been the only real money for centuries. Indestructible. Alt-Gold does not exist and there's nothing humans can do to change that.

@_date: 2018-01-04 06:12:40
Significant probability (&gt;50% imo) Bitcoin will break out of this ~14.6k-15.4K channel to the downside. 75% correction from 20k to 5k will be the result.
Then Bitcoin will suffer a long slow drift lower towards the zero asymptote as better, cheaper, quicker coins take over.

@_date: 2017-12-24 21:08:42
You have several reasons to be stressed. First of all, you never should have spent money you needed for financial reasons. But you know that already.
Secondly, IMO, Bitcoin could drop much more from here.
For me, a true "fire sale" is at least 75% off. That's at least half of half. That means Bitcoin @ ~$5000 (20000/2/2). I would not be surprised to see Bitcoin at this level.
@_date: 2019-07-16 22:06:31
Sounds romantic; breaking federal laws and hiding underground with other die hard coin HODLers. Perhaps if you live in some 3rd world this could make some sense. But in USA? The FBI will hunt you down relentlessly. And even if you do manage to keep your coins secret, good luck ever cashing them in and doing anything meaningful with the assets, like buying real estate for example. Thanks; but I'll pass.

I'm thinking people will always want to diversify their crypto holdings due to high volatility in any 1 coin. Bitcoin could be the best stable place to park $ long term due to its longest history+brand. For daily spending though, use whatever alt coin happens to be all the rage atm.

I admit in theory, Bitcoin, by itself, could work. But leave it to human greed to create an infinite supply of altcoins. And so we did.
Gold can't be replicated and you have to get your hands dirty and burn time and resources to get it. Period. It's the only real money for centuries for a reason. No matter how hard humans try, it's impossible to create alt-gold.
Why did Gold become the best element for money?
@_date: 2019-06-19 22:22:14


Or it can fall back to 3000...or zero for that matter.
Regardless, if Bitcoin or any one of the thousands of altcoins ever came close to threatening the FED's grip on everything money, it will be regulated/banned with heavy criminal penalties. I read FacePlant had a meeting with the FED regarding their new coin. And today FED chair said: "U.S. central bank would likely have input in any regulations that take shape in the wake of Facebook’s Libra debut." I read "likely" to mean 100% lol.
And today it's interesting to observe Facebook's share price dropping. Hmmm.
TL;DR The FED won't allow Bitcoin or any other coin to threaten central bank's ability to carry out monetary policy. Period. End of story. In the meantime, I admit Bitcoin/altcoins is a great speculative day trading instrument. Plenty of i-Sheep suckers to buy&amp;lose in the next bubble.
@_date: 2019-06-20 05:54:25
Assuming you live in a first world country, what do you plan to do if your government bans owning or using Bitcoin or any one of the thousands of altcoins? Do you plan on breaking the law?
Stupid question but suppose you decide (and succeed)  to keep your coins secret from your government. How do you ever cash them in the future (like, to buy a house) without some bank or exchange knowing and reporting you?
@_date: 2019-06-20 23:47:38
Well then the whole selling point of Bitcoin, which really took off in 2011, seems to me to be dissolving. I don't see anyone using it for daily transactions where I live, and see no signs of growth.
A cashless society is the Banks' endgame. Idiots using CC cards for "points" and actually prefer digital currency now. The banks just want a cut on every transaction, right down to the ice cream cone you buy from a street vendor.
FacePlant's new coin probably has the best chance to really take off with the younger gen mass consumer debt slave i-Sheep, as it will be sold with "safety &amp; security". It's all about your safety lol. Kids today just want (brainwashed) to be safe in their safe space.
@_date: 2019-06-20 01:26:11
It's cool, no offence please and none taken. I have great respect for those making big money trading Bitcoin. Bigger balls than me. But at the end of the road, the FED will regulate &amp; squash anything that threatens their grip on monetary policy. Ask Muammar Gaddafi how well his gold backed Dinar worked out. And then go visit Ross Ulbricht in jail and ask him how his fortune in Bitcoin is doing. I sincerely wish you good luck and if I were you and someday make big profit on Bitcoin...know your exit door. Don't get too greedy.
@_date: 2019-06-20 07:32:15

No...and I'm sorry if I came off that way. Yeah, I suppose there is some tiny actual need for Bitcoin IF you are poor and at the same time, IF you are fleeing a failing country. But wouldn't a small hunk of gold hidden *you know where*, work even better in cases like this?
@_date: 2019-06-20 22:07:04
I can see this being maybe doable if you bought all your Bitcoin (just using Bitcoin as example, could be any altcoin too) before all the exchange reporting regulations were in place. FYI I tried to buy a few Bitcoins on Coinbase and they required that I submit all my I.D. information. So if you buy Bitcoin today (assuming you live in 1st world country like USA) your government can &amp; will know every detail.
I highly doubt the excuse of "I lost my coins" is going to work once FED regulations kick in. And I don't think I could sleep well at night knowing my government is out looking for illegal Bitcoin holders. They got one of the best dark web guys, Ross Ulbricht, to cough up his coins. 
From Wikipedia:
"An FBI spokesperson said that the agency would hold the bitcoins until Ulbricht's trial finished, after which the bitcoins would be liquidated. In October 2013, the FBI reported that it had seized 144,000 bitcoins, worth $28.5 million, and that the bitcoins belonged to Ulbricht."

If you can't afford to invest in real estate, I suggest you invest in other *real things*. Scour garage sales, flee markets and Craigslist for old video games, old Oakley &amp; Ray Ban sunglasses, vintage JBL speakers, musical instruments, **GOLD &amp; SILVER ANYTHING*, Rolex watches, etc.
I have a collection of old discontinued but new in box Oakley sunglasses that go up in value every year.
Paper money just becomes more worthless every day--you know that already. But I'm sorry to report that shitcoin and all of the hundreds of alt-shitcoins won't save you here. Invest in real stuff that goes up in value due to rarity.
If everyone just invested in gold and silver, everyone would win. Absolutely.  You can't create gold &amp; silver out of thin air. No alt-gold possible.

Oh for sure, this I agree 100%. The banksters want a cashless society where they get a cut of every single transaction, no matter the size or venue.
Flee markets, street vendor haggling, garage sales, Craigslist, etc. will all be snuffed out. Huge money to be made for banksters once the retarded &amp; ignorant i-sheep are all on board with crypto. Make no mistake though, the future crypto currency we will be allowed to use will be controlled by Central Banks. It most certainly won't be Bitcoin lol.
The future Central Bank controlled crypto will be *extra safe* and even insured against hackers. And all the safe space i-kids will just eat it up.

You think Finland is any different? Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Diner's Club Cards are all widely accepted in Finland. The swipe fees are charged to the merchant and then the cost is passed on to you the consumer. In other words, nearly everything (not cars or motorcycles for examples) you buy in Finland has credit card merchant fees built/jacked into the price.
Don't believe me? Go to a motorcycle dealership in Finland. Negotiate the best price for a bike "out the door". After you are all done negotiating, tell them you wish to pay with a credit card. They won't honor the price you negotiated because they assumed you would be paying cash (or bank check). Most dealership won't accept credit cards. Now you see why? Fees, buddy.
FFS you have no idea how &amp; why you are being ripped off. Unbelievable.

Speaking of cash only, I was recently flying out of Hawaii on United. They only offered meals and snacks that you pay for...credit card only lol. I kindly told them I ONLY had cash and read them what is written on every bill: "This note is legal tender blah blah blah". After a few minutes of resistance &amp; confusion, they gave me a free meal. Apparently they had no procedure in place to handle cash. Shame on them.
And everywhere I go I ask for 3-5% cash discount and more often than not, I win. Sometimes much more than 5% too. Ask to see the hotel manager and negotiate with cash, especially on longer stays in off season. If you don't give me a discount for cash, I'll walk away if I can-- I admit gas stations and chain grocery stores are difficult if not impossible. There should be a law to protect cash buyers against credit card fee extortion.
