Mining in Quebec, Canada with full support for SegWit. Very excited about running a lightning channel as well.

Is this US politics v2? The whole thing is a show and distraction.

Probably gift cards that some fraudsters has bought with a stolen credit card and then sold to gyft.

From my point of view, pooled mining has been decentralising more and more with time contrary to what's been said most of the time. GHash had almost 50% of the network hashrate just 3 years ago. You can select different timeframes and verify by yourself here :

I thought not. It's not a story Core would tell you. It's a ClassicXT2mbUnlimited legend. Darth Wu was a Dark Lord of the Megabytes, so powerful and so wise he could use the Mining to influence the spammers to create bigger blocks... He had such a knowledge of the ASICboost that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Mining is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed his node in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.

There is a bunch of code in the making to fix alot of today's ''scaling issues''. Segregated Witness is the first one pushed forward because of the ease it was supposed to be to launched with. Most of the future improvements are already planned and partially coded and will require Segregated Witness, Schnorr for instance.
Plus I recall looking at a presentation demo of cross-channels transfer and Im pretty sure in a scenario where Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft all have channels interlinked, locking some coins in a channel wont matter that much. Maybe Bigger Blocks will be a necessity, but it is far from being the case at the moment.

Andreas have said in one of his talk Bitcoin should be named TrustNet. I like TrustNet.

Yes they send you your ''card'' by email within 4-6 confirmations. Ordered there some time with entire satisfaction.

I buy from Bitmain and would only recommend buying a antminer from somewhere else if there is a rebate in price. You have a 180-days warranty on Bitmain products and shipping is very fast. 
Bitmain isnt really appreciated due to their political moves and I strongly disagree with their moves aswell but the gear is good. Also don't underestimate difficulty rises.

The flaw doesnt directly impact the security behind your coins. I recommend this awesome simplification of the security behind your coins : 
That beign said ASICboost could lead to mining centralization which is undesired. SegWit will fix this, and despite what is going on I keep thinking we won't split and we'll have SegWit.. but that still has to be seen.

"In particular, the protocol interactions of the covert method can block the implementation of virtuous improvements such as segregated witness. Exploitation of this vulnerability could result in payoff of as much as $100 million USD per year at the time this was written (Assuming at 50% hash-power miner was gaining a 30% power advantage and that mining was otherwise at profit equilibrium). This could have a phenomenal centralizing effect by pushing mining out of profitability for all other participants, and the income from secretly using this optimization could be abused to significantly distort the Bitcoin ecosystem in order to preserve the advantage. Reverse engineering of a mining ASIC from a major manufacture has revealed that it contains an undocumented, undisclosed ability to make use of this attack."

My observations makes me think the network actually decentralised more and more in the last years. 
Just take a look and compare pools dominance a year ago and today, then look in the pool themselves the hashrate looks pretty distributed and still plenty of small miners. 
ASICs sure arent as scarce as GPUs but Im not worried about decentralization. The only problem I see is Bitmain playing politics beign the only quality hardware supplier, they make awesome machines I own some, they put pressure on the big players discounting units in exchange of an allegiance towards some goal.
ASICboost is a newly discovered threat, not an immediate threat but it has to be taken away, the faster the better.

Ive been linking friends and famility to this article too. Very useful. Well written. Thanks for your time aswell in this community. Dollar cost averaging is definately the way to go and the way I roll. (+mining)
