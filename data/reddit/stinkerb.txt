And how would that happen without some form of regulation, ie power by the government to do something about it?
@_date: 2016-08-14 16:17:21
I thought the last safe version of true crypt was 7.1a  ?  Is that true?
@_date: 2016-08-07 20:39:13
I thought bitcoin was all about non-regulation and not having "authorities" involved.  Now the community is crying for government involvement?
@_date: 2015-06-02 05:37:49
Chaos.  Got it.
@_date: 2015-06-02 05:37:10
Well, I wouldnt go to /christianity.  I would attempt to find a historian for some facts.  I'm looking for the same here.  
@_date: 2017-02-28 02:50:17
You're supposed to say.. I'm not trolling.
@_date: 2017-02-28 02:10:11
If BK hadn't just been yelling overtop of Peter the whole time, it might have been better.
@_date: 2017-02-24 22:01:56
Truly, this thread really showcases the level of maturity surrounding bitcoin. Well done fellas. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 02:09:44
I don't think there is ever a "promise" in pyramid schemes.  Just the implication that if you get in early, you can make more money, and the more people you get involved, the more money you'll make.  Sounds a lot like bitcoin to me.
@_date: 2015-01-23 03:35:35
But a user of fiat, can just use cash.  They are not forced to use banks either.
They use banks because of all of the nice features they get.  The same will likely happen with things like coinbase. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 06:22:17
Thanks for the replies.  But can someone explain how these two "interests" in bitcoin are not a conflict of interest?  At least in terms of public perception on them.
When I look into the discussions of bitcoin enthusiasts, I see so much obsession with the "market", and not enough with the power bitcoins bring to society.
To me, it really does smell like one big ponzi scheme.  Not saying it is necessarily, but thats how it looks for sure.
@_date: 2017-02-11 19:47:20
Pyramid scheme.
@_date: 2015-01-23 03:45:43
Absolutely!  Linux all the way!
@_date: 2017-02-04 16:22:05
Seems like any other group could just start their own crypto-currency and entice others to use it because its so cheap.  Its like a whole bunch of pyramid schemes.  Why not start your own?  To me, bitcoin has always seemed a bit like a pyramid scheme.
@_date: 2015-01-02 21:55:02
Why are you humble?
@_date: 2017-02-07 16:03:54
Not really.  The only thing driving up the price of bitcoin, is bitcoin being bought.  This is not true of other investments.
@_date: 2017-03-12 16:50:16
I love how all the redditors are more qualified to dismiss the possible creator of bitcoin, than the guy who was the first developer on bitcoin and took over from Satoshi.
@_date: 2017-03-12 19:48:20
known scammer?
@_date: 2017-03-06 05:27:34
If nigeria said it, it must be true.
@_date: 2017-03-13 04:16:42
examples?  
@_date: 2017-03-27 23:50:32
I don't trust this sub for being unbiased anymore.
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:15:47
Yes!  We've been infiltrated by spies and intelligence agents who are undermining us at every turn with their trolling.
@_date: 2017-03-17 02:07:17
Ugh.  The bitcoin community IS toxic.
@_date: 2017-02-27 20:24:53
I still think he's that Craig guy.  I'm not trolling.
@_date: 2017-03-12 20:49:13
No it hasn't.  The same concept has just been reported on that many times.  It does not invalidate the concept.
@_date: 2016-06-21 20:52:09
@_date: 2017-03-28 20:30:28
"What bitcoin is"
@_date: 2016-06-21 20:54:22
So far, just more hate and not much rational.
@_date: 2017-01-07 16:44:58
So in your world, everyone's a dick then.  Got it.
@_date: 2017-01-26 21:29:59
As a bitcoin newb, can someone explain to me how this lengthy wait time for transactions is not crippling to bitcoin's future?
@_date: 2017-01-17 07:06:54
Or, you know, the real estate of theirs thats now cheap to buy.
@_date: 2017-01-27 16:45:27
@_date: 2017-01-08 16:09:11
Well, they aren't wrong that its made-up money.  It is all just made up.  And as such, its their right to dismiss it, just as its your right to embrace it.
@_date: 2016-06-21 15:48:07
I think many people would be interested in knowing who started bitcoin, so I don't think it does not matter.
I'm just trying to understand your backlash, and many other peoples.  Care to enlighten me with some reasons why you are so unwilling to entertain that he might be Satoshi?
@_date: 2016-06-21 20:53:24
Gavin perhaps.
@_date: 2015-07-25 18:27:08
People jumping on the bandwagon can be good or bad.  Remember that.
@_date: 2015-08-16 08:29:11
You're a smart guy. I like you. 
@_date: 2017-04-09 06:57:47
Yep, this is why I'm down on bitcoin.  Way to many issues.  The only people who buy are holding onto it because they want to make money on the pyramid scheme.  
I love the idea, but its just a techy wet dream for now.
@_date: 2016-02-11 18:33:43
Someone's posting "PANIC" on reddit, hoping to spark actual talk of panic.
@_date: 2017-04-10 14:43:34
Typical reddit censorship.  No one notices until it happens to you.
@_date: 2015-04-27 09:02:46


I'm starting to hate that overused term.
@_date: 2017-05-29 04:15:54
Nice work!  Now the value of our bitcoins will stay high forever, and we'll be rich!
@_date: 2017-05-30 02:55:51
Which is why it will never reach critical popular mass.
@_date: 2017-05-04 17:52:31
@_date: 2017-05-24 22:56:31
This next fall is going to hurt.
@_date: 2017-05-27 14:53:10
Just the beginning.
@_date: 2017-05-26 01:27:17
Back down we go.  $200 anyone?
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:48:27
And you don't think all the people will start selling their bitcoin at this all time high, once the dip starts, fearing losing all their newfound money?  Its being treated as a commodity like any other on the stock market.  It goes up, it'll go down.  If I had a ton of bitcoin right now, I'd sell that shit off fast, like right now.
@_date: 2017-05-25 04:06:51
Maybe.  But that's just like any stock.  And its one thats been going through a major hype growth phase.  Eventually, it'll pop.
@_date: 2017-05-29 06:26:13
How is one guy supposedly defeating this amazing decentralized system? 
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:00:17
Hahaha.  Wishful thinking my friend.  I forsee 400-500.
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:59:46
If I was you, I'd get the fuck out of there now.
@_date: 2017-05-26 14:51:54
God it I had a lot of bitcoin, I'd sell that shit so fast right now.
@_date: 2017-05-26 14:50:38
I love all this current need for justification about how this time its different.  
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:02:17
When it falls back down to reality (ie. 400-500) buy some more.
@_date: 2017-05-24 03:42:38
Cause everyone silently knows it going to plummet back down soon.
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:12:39
They are not bubbles.  
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:02:04
Lol, you people are in for some sore days ahead.  
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:58:13
So you are denying its a bubble?  Lol, ok whatever.
@_date: 2017-05-02 14:35:19
This next crash is gonna hurt a lot of people.  
@_date: 2017-05-25 00:32:06
Good lord, everyone on here is in for a shock when it crashes.
@_date: 2017-05-26 15:38:18
It won't.  It will slowly die off as other better things come along.  Much along the lines of Linux.
@_date: 2017-05-29 16:54:17
Redditor for 0 days huh?
@_date: 2015-02-06 19:49:37
Bitcoins are great for the environment.
@_date: 2015-02-12 01:04:26
haha - no biased there.  He's only invested everything into his bitcoin ventures.  lol.
@_date: 2017-06-16 19:14:58
And yet most people getting into it are investors, looking for returns.
@_date: 2017-06-15 01:26:26
Love these messages trying to convince people to buy.  Give it a break.  The downturn hasn't even barely started yet.  What a horrible fucking time to buy.
@_date: 2017-06-26 15:09:19
This sub is sounding more and more like a pyramid scheme.
@_date: 2017-06-09 20:46:43
And then we'll see $500.  Whats your point?
