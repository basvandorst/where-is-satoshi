Another provider called 2talk who specialise in VoIP also now accept Bitcoin in NZ. Unlimited plans are now very common here for around 85nzd

Awesome, thanks for all the hard work. Development is the most important part of bitcoin, the price should come second!
Cool how it was dated by the block number.

It's also hard explaining how the basic reserve banking system works to a lot of people too! Normally I'll just use the e-mail analogy and explain further if they're interested.

If something 'fishy' was ever to be preformed it would be done by a high paid professional. For a financial instrument the idea that this is even possible is not good enough.
There is no problem in admitting a weakness, acceptance is the first stage to recovery.

Perhaps it's done through a third party that doesn't accept Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-07-03 10:14:29
Is it possible you can link the original source.
@_date: 2014-07-05 01:06:13
Both are very possible.

In the future more applications will be developed to allow sending to a name rather than address. Bitcoin is still not quite ready for mass adoption,

At this point the extra couple of percent can easily be attained with low capital anyway, I think anything over 25 percent should be concerning?

It depends where you live, coinbase if you're in the USA. If not there are many online exchanges or your could use localbitcoins to meet someone local.
@_date: 2014-06-11 07:18:13
I like it. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 09:49:29
Bitcoin still has some issues that need to be ironed out. No one is asking you to pour actual money into it. It should grow as it's ready and problems like this can be resolved. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 06:12:47
Because business does not work like that.

Not true if there are enough people. Tcp/ip isn't anonymous but it doesn't mean applications can't be built on top of it to provide it.

I run my forwarded client throughout the time my computer is on, which is most of the day. For us with unlimited internet it's not much of a sacrifice.

Please don't be so naive. 80% of the world hates you not envy you (no the hate is not jealously). Saying it like it's a good thing just shows your arrogance.
P.S I don't hate any nation.

If this is correct it still doesn't matter, it isn't a long term solution.

A miner is going to mine where they make the most profit or are provided with the best overall service. Reminding the community of this problem that isn't going to solve its self is not a waste of time.
@_date: 2014-06-08 06:11:39
Unfortunately not.
@_date: 2014-06-08 04:21:35
People need to understand that simply telling people to move pool isn't enough. This is economics, the larger miners (and the only ones that actually matter) are not going to move unless there is economic incentive . It is vital we give these miners reason to decentralize via pushing P2P or better competition.

I work in tech support and often those who know a little are more dangerous then those who know nothing.
The 50 year old mom would never touch her advanced settings but her 'tech savvy' 14 year old certinely does.

Way to immature.
@_date: 2014-06-08 05:05:44
Can someone explain technically just how easy it is to double spend or abuse a 51% pool? Obviously no one should have this kind of trust but how easily can an attack be done?
@_date: 2014-06-08 04:58:59
You make a good point, humans are an enemy of this planet, no doubt. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 06:15:00
Perhaps not most but at-least a significant amount. This is a issue that cannot be left unsolved.

Disk2VHD is an easy programme to take a copy but tbh cloning the drive will put it under a lot more stress than quickly checking for a wallet file and copying it off.

In theory the price of BTC should fall by what the market values BCC but who knows how the market will react.
@_date: 2017-07-29 16:03:49
Is Finex supporting BCC?

It's impossible to predict what would have happened in the second world war had America not got involved. I think saying America saved the day is a bit shortsighted, I would say the Russians (USSR) played a much more significant role in weakening Germany. The also payed a much larger price and deserve to be mentioned in any discussion about who helped win the war.
Also I think a lot of problems today can be traced back to British imperialism, America has just done it in their own way. I can't believe you really believe America does it for the good of the world though, of course they don't. That's not how humans operate.
