Hello anyone,  I am an unfortunate wash resident,  I didn't get any kind of notice about this at all, went into poloniex one day and no access. been a nightmare ever since. It took 6 days before anyone replied to my support ticket.  they have my money and not much help to get it moved.  I have btc, usdt, and dash.  i gave them a btc address to coinbase , created a dash wallet to send dashcoin to , now usd and usdt are different so I have no clue how to get it,   my big question (or 2)  does anyone know of any exchange still operating in washington state that I can open an account on to transfer my usdt to.  just so I can convert it to bitcoin and transfer it again back to coinbase?    usdt is usd thether    tether doesn't operate in the US,    looks like oregon is ok for now in bitrexx I have family there that might be able to open an account to receive funds for me , anyone go this route?

yes i'm a noob , learning curve is ongoing, didn't even know about tether when i deposited funds in it , i thought it was simply usd as in cash , a spot to park funds while out of market , I noticed from scanning the trollbox people were keeping funds in bitcoin, but it was just too volitile for me as a holding place,  silly me..  sometimes crisis learning works best but can be costly,  I did find a site called coinpayments.net that has usdt and once I get my usdt there I can convert to bitcoin and hopefully move it back to coinbase until I figure out where I can trade from again, i may be sol,  but it was fun while it lasted....
