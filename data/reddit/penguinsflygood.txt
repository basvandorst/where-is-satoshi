We'll probably have 8 billion people in 2025 though.

When I start to see it going up and think it will keep going up. So, probably before the next halfening

it's funny because heroin is one of the most sketchy things that the darknet catered to... there was always scandals of a dealer lacing his shit with fentanyl

The only part that is biased imo is the part where she refuses to say the claims about  Ellen Pao, all other parts of the article are fair and reasonable.

Taking the money and running would have definitely been a smart thing to do. But yea none of these markets will ever come close to the original silk road. Ross even had a bitcoin hedging service where silk road took 10% of the transaction in exchange for hedging it to the dollar amount upon completion.

Yea I just lost a little bit of respect for this sub. Calling someone a SJW has to be the lamest way to dismiss someone's opinion. I really don't think you need a great moral compas to realize jailbait is wrong and is a stepping stone to CP. I was on voat before the FPH emigration there and it was a much nicer place than it is now.
edit after -6 :
lmao, you all are fucking retarded if you think this article was horribly biased feminist propaganda. so fucking what she used the word misogynist. may god help you retards, hopefuly you don't invest all your money into what will be known if it fails as a massive ponzi scheme that was mainly supported by the drug trade.

humble bundle store(not the main bundle but the store) stopped accepting bitcoins. I was saddened because I did buy games off there every once in a while.

If bitcoin fails doesn't it take all the altcoins with it?

Eh I don't care about the votes so much as what it potentially says about the audience, but you could be right it could be FPH trolls using irc or voat to brigade. But I really don't think so as seems to attract these crazy right wing libertarian types. There's a lot of smart discussion on here no doubt but there's also a group that is very political.

Hes just saying he was surprised it wasn't taken down. Take a chill pill bro

Yea but solid state drives seem to be getting cheaper and cheaper.

They could always use the altcoin to buy bitcoins.
