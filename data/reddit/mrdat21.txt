Consensus is marketing wise one of the better organised conferences but once you are there it feels empty... very empty... There are  exceptions and everyone knows them by now if you are a while into Bitcoin. 
TIP 1: enjoy NY
TIP 2: People who have not the money or did not get tickets for this conference, don't worry, look for the little after gigs in the early evenings. More fun, more quality if you don't end up being scamed ... don't trust verify!
Blockchain \(s\) \(technology\), ICO's and DLT's and other fancy names are just words... and are being used/abused by very powerfull smart marketing and communication agencies.

Well, Roger, Theymos , did NOT delete this post. My feeling is that you treat bitcoin like a company. If Bitcoin were a company I would totally agree with you. Please be patient. Whatever people say about you, I appreciate the efforts you did so far to promote Bitcoin. Your passion is sometimes too much for some very rational people around here. 
I try to understand both of you and sometimes it is difficult... It start with the language (finesse/nuance), the complexity of the whole Bitcoin concept, the community, etc...
