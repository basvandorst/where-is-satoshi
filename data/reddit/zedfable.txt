I'm not a big time player by any stretch of the imagination, but I have certainly pulled out more then $600 USD from Coinbase last year. Not to mention if I ever make a big purchase at TigerDirect or Overstock.

Can we start a cool "Look what cool passphrase I found/made" thread?
Several people alluded to finnishing the xkcd correct horse passphrase, and if you do it slow enough to let the partial phrases register, you'll even get a kind of ASCII animation. Nifty!
Here are some others and who discovered them:
passphrase.io (bitfreak)
satoshi nakamoto (aviathor)
Satoshi Nakamoto (bluesyn)

Doesn't have to, but thats certainly the most popular use of the word nowadays... If I had to guess, I'd bet that they've partnered with Gyft.com in some way- perhaps you can link your accounts? That would be cool, though not earth shattering. Gyft is the only other big bitcoin app I can think of right now though that isn't a wallet.

Bitcoin isn't backed by a hard commodity, but it really isn't fiat. Fiat means a government TELLS you it's worth something and that you have to accept it for payment as legal tender (the whole "this bill is legal tender, suitable for all debts public and private" thing written on every bill).
Bitcoin is something new though- its value is purely based on the market and people voluntarily deciding for themselves if they believe in the mathematics and ethos of the currency.

I don't wholly disagree with you- you are correct that the market sets the price for all kinds of things. I do believe however that the Latin itself ("let it be done", "it shall be") implies someone/something of authority to make that order. That is one of the things that makes bitcoin different.
