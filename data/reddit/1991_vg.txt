Does anyone have a suggestion for buying a largish (25-50K USD) amount of BTC, with payment via wire? 
I'm OK with the usual KYC requirements but don't want anything tied directly to accounts (so ACH, etc is out.)
I looked a couple months ago but it was a bit confusing and it seemed like quite a few of the exchanges were having issues enough to scare me off. 
Not new to BTC, but my current coins were all mined years ago and looking to expand my position.

I got an old junk netbook for the task, and actually removed the hard disk and wifi adapter from it. I use a live bootable USB linux distro (TAILS on USB) with the paper wallet generator copied onto it. 
You really don't need a new laptop for this, just a secure one. Without a disk or network card, it's difficult to imagine the system getting compromised (you could pull the mic and speakers as well if you're really paranoid.)
Once powered off, assuming you did nothing to write to the USB, the paper wallet keys will be the only method of accessing the coins stored on them.

If I could know the answer to just one question, this would be the one.
I think this is *the* question to be answered. If the answer is yes, BFL is without doubt a criminal enterprise, and if the answer is no, BFL borders on criminally incompetent, but would still be at fault for marketing devices they presumably knew they couldn't ship.
I was lucky enough to earn back about 4X my investment on miners that shipped 8 months later than promised. Had they delivered as promised, I quite literally would have made millions. I've always wondered if someone else in fact did do so with my late hardware.

It's very liquid. 
The bullion dealers make their money on the spread between sell and buy, typically they buy at the current spot (plus a premium depending on the type of gold you have, for example gold eagles right now have a premium of $60-$70 when being sold to you, and $25 when they're buying it back.)  Right now, one dealer will sell you one 1oz eagle for $1344, and will buy the same coin back at $1294 when the spot price is $1270. So you can see the price difference is $50, or 3.7% of the price, and because it's a minted coin of high reputation, it's worth $25 above the spot price when you sell it. That's a middle-of-the-road cost, if you buy more the percentage will go down, and during runs you'll see crazy things happen with premiums exploding.
The cash4gold type places are usually not a great place to sell, but coin dealers generally are a good places and know their business well.
You do have to factor in tax implications on appreciation, however, as gold is taxes as a collectible at a very unfavorable rate.

While they're pointing at the police asking them to do this, I really think this is Choke Point at work.
I doubt the license bitcoin places will be able to transact this way, we already know they've shut down customer accounts for spending at the wrong places. No doubt a good time to be a mixer (or a good time to move purchases to multiple wallets to give the those selling bitcoin enough plausible deniability that the DoJ and FinCEN leave them alone.)

I'd love to see what kind of amazing mathematical gyrations took place in order to make this statement:


A 1.1% post-inflation return for cash (which like gold doesn't return any interest at all but unlike gold has consistently depreciated in value for the past 40 years) when the cumulative CPI for the same time frame (1975-2015) for the USD is 444% seems... unlikely. Indeed the CPI is pretty much based off of the devaluation of cash.
One of many things bitcoin and gold seem to share in common is the appearance of articles like this that make significant efforts to scare you away from buying it, citing arguments and sources that fall apart in the slightest breeze of inquiry.
@_date: 2015-07-10 21:43:43
And coinbase has done similar things. Pretty much every exchange that's touching the financial system will have to deal with this.
It's a pain, but I think the "right way" to do this now is to buy the coin, transfer that coin to another wallet, and then run that wallet through a mixer to a third wallet. This creates plausible deniability (first transaction) and eliminates any way to watch where the coin goes (second transaction.) 
The reality is buying bitcoin from an exchange is not anonymous, and they're using that fact to prove to regulators they're not enabling activity (legal though it is!) they're trying to prevent with the Choke Point bullshit.
@_date: 2015-07-11 17:38:04
This isn't about becoming anonymous to law enforcement, it's about being opaque enough to the exchange that your account doesn't get closed. Note that I don't even mention the mixer being anonymous, just eliminating the ability of the exchange to track where the coin you purchased went. 
In this instance, we're seeing accounts being closed for spending coins on legal behavior (posting under backpage is pretty clearly protected speech, even if the advertisement is for something not legal), this is similar to how USD accounts have been closed under Operation Choke Point for legal behavior.

The provisions for handling accounts this way are in [Title II of Dodd-Frank]( though Obama can't really be claimed as singularly responsible, though the law did originate from the adminstration. 
Originally in the [Federal Deposit Insurance Act]( depositors were in second position after administrative payments. (See section 11, "Depositor Preference.")
Under Dodd-Frank, under Claim Priority, depositors are moved into the "unsecured creditor" category, and are in fifth position for payment, they're actually behind things like derivatives counterparties, which are secured creditors.

I mine and did some simple modeling based on the network hashrate as the ASICs come online. How much you make is heavily dependent on the rate capacity comes online and at what time your unit shows up.
If your the little SC showed up _today_ you could make about $100 a day. GIven that you'll be behind something on the order of 10,000 other customers... It's not going to be today. BFL has said their first order of ASICs were 70K chips, I did some math on that and a fairly strong delivery schedule (1000 units per week, keep in mind each unit uses several ASIC chips). Ten weeks after they start shipping, a bitforce little will make about $7.50 a day.
I went through a few more iterations, and really, if you're not in the first batch, you likely will never break even. Even those on the tail end of it (which is where I'm at) will likely not break even for more than a year.
Ninja edit: was using my older spreadsheet, needed to update the exchange rates.
So realistically, buy more BTC.
@_date: 2013-01-18 21:56:09
TL;DR: Don't. If you do, cheapest is free parts and free power.
Let me vent a little and show the math about how the reality of mining will change with ASICs.
We're likely just a couple weeks away from conventional mining becoming pointless due to ASIC coming online. Seriously, don't spend a dime on mining unless you just want to lose money learning to do it, hobby style -- even with the new ASIC rigs, only those delivered in the first two weeks will pay for themselves in any reasonable timeframe.
That said, if you want to do a little mining, I'd look for a used desktop PC (processor is unimportant) and try to grab an older ATI graphics card for cheap (I say ATI because they produce about 3X the bitcoins compared to Nvidia due to some architecture issues -- it has nothing to do with graphics performance.)
To set expectations, I have a dual PCI-e graphics motherboard, and two high end ATI boards (7970s, you're actually better off with older boards, I think the 5830 has the best bang for the buck.) I get about 700-800 MHash/s with this.
The magic formula for bitcoins mined per day is 3600*your hash rate / network hash rate. For a 700 MH/s rig, that/s 3600 * 700 / 20000000, or 0.126 BTC per day. Less than $2 USD, not counting power costs.
The current promised performance for the ASIC rigs is about 60 GH/s (Avalon or Butterfly labs). It will take only 333 units to match (e.g. double) the current network hash rate. Avalon's first batch is promised to be 300, and Butterfly labs has orders measured in the thousands, and with their current promised schedule, would be delivering about 1000 units per week. 
The first 1000 units will basically result in a network hash rate 4X what it is now. So that same dual GPU rig at 700 MH/s: 3600 * 700 / 80000000 = 0.0315 BTC per day, or 47 cents. A week later, the next 1000 units come online, and now the network hash rate has nearly doubled in a week. At this point, that700 MH/s GPU rig makes 3600 * 600 / 140000000 = 0.018 BTC, or 27 cents.
I won't iterate through all of it, but six weeks in, a basic GPU mining rig will produce less than 10 cents a day. A single 60 GH/s ASIC rig will be making $8 a day, and will take 6 months to break even provided *not a single additional miner comes online.* In reality, many more ASICs will come online, and after only about the first two weeks any ASIC miner will be lucky to break even in a couple years, if ever. Long-haul miners will eek out a small profit if their power is free; this isn't too different from GPU today, but the difference is the capital costs are much higher, pushing the payback periods into years.
@_date: 2013-03-08 01:51:09
I'm sure one or more someones have, likely in early preorders. 
I looked into it, but decided against from a risk management perspective (not only the price, but the odds of having one box go down and take you out of mining is far higher than losing the equivalent number of singles, so I went with X singles instead, assuming they actually deliver.)
@_date: 2013-01-19 00:33:31

~ 800 MH/s. 7950 and 7970, running 24/7 I make about 0.1 BTC per day.

Looks like conventional profit-taking to me. Someone sold approximately $140,000 USD in bitcoins and it moved the market a little. That amount would be consistent with a medium-sized investor liquidating a position.
Since BTC is reaching near-term highs, investors (aka speculators) that bought in at lows months ago will be inclined to exit and take profits. Others will stay with it, but current exchange rates are very favorable to sellers that have bought into BTC in the past 18 months.
@_date: 2013-02-17 21:40:00
ASICs should be completely neutral to the value of BTC.
The protocol is designed to self-regulate block discovery to approximately one block every 10 minutes (so 6 blocks per hour, and 144 blocks per day. The reward is currently 25 BTC per block after the halving that happened late last year.)
A year ago, a block was produced every 10 minutes, and a year before that, too.
I would expect BTC to go up over time as more interest happens, but that's due to it getting used as a value exchange and not due to the technology used to perform hashes. I really don't think network hashrate has any bearing on adoption whatsoever.
@_date: 2013-01-18 18:55:51
I agree with this as well. I've done metals investing in the past, and I suspect that handling BTC is similar, essentially you owe capital gains tax on the increase in value over the basis. (In metals, the rate is even higher than normal cap gains. I don't think there's a tax ruling on BTC being a "collectible" yet, which would establish the rate.)
There is a bit of a grey area, which is if you're mining, your earnings are in BTC, and profits are unrealized until they're converted to USD (or spent.) I'm not clear if you'd have to perform a calculation and pay taxes annually if you've just let the BTC sit in an account, I'll actually ask my CPA about that.
@_date: 2013-02-13 05:42:22
Doubtful, BFL says shipping will probably happen sometime next week (if there are no further delays.) Unless this is a BFL test, in which case it would be crazy for them to not identify themselves.
Most likely it's someone who did an early preorder of many Avalon systems, or it's one of the ASIC mining partnerships going online. My bet is it's a stack of Avalons.
@_date: 2013-03-01 19:51:49
Supply doesn't really go down that much on average -- the whole point of the difficulty adjustment is to maintain a steady supply. Also, the new supply both pre/post difficulty adjustment is so small relative to the bitcoin economy it has very little impact on price. Demand and velocity are far more significant on the BTC exchange rates.
@_date: 2013-03-08 02:36:13
It's not directly represented on the stock market. There are lots of different types of financial markets: stocks, bond, commodities. The closest "real" market to bitcoin is FX (foreign exchange, or currency markets, where different currencies are exchanged, such as USD (US Dollar) for JPY (Japanese Yen) or GBP (British Pound.) 
When you look at the "price" of bitcoin, you're really looking at the exchange rate for USD to BTC. FX markets are among the most volatile financial markets in the world, because they depend on two sets of variables -- each currency/government/central bank has it own variables, and the exchange of two currencies involves both sets. It's entirely possible to get a "bubble" like move in say the USD, if something happens that makes another currency depreciate or seem unsafe. We've seen that several times during the European crisis, where people have bought USD with Euros in a panic, driving up the price of USD and driving down the price of the Euro. People in the US won't notice this much because prices are denominated in dollars already, but in other countries with imports priced in dollars it can have a large effect on prices, especially oil/gas.
While that's how BTC trades and FX is the market that most closely a resembles bitcoin exchange, bitcoin itself has the characteristics of a limited supply commodity (precious metals like gold being the best example here.)

Actually their offices are in Leawood, Kansas, but they said the bumping facility, packaging and testing houses were in all in CA. If I remember correctly the plan was to get the completed ASICs and reflow them onto the boards in-house in Kansas, burn-in for 24 hours, then ship.
Ninja edit: They're going to Chicago for reflow, then boards to Kansas for test and ship.
@_date: 2013-04-05 05:25:36
I've researched this myself, and as the others have said, it's pretty straightforward. 
First, talk to a tax accountant. This is important because timing and how the profits are categorized can affect the tax rate, and he's best suited to figuring out the right approach to minimize tax impact while remaining legal. There may be several approaches including treating you bitcoin activities as business, as well as determining if it's short term or long term capital gains, which have different tax implications.
Second, following advice of accountant, you need to realize a gain before you need to pay taxes. If you had 1000 bitcoins in 2011 and have never sold them, even though on paper you've make over $100K+, you have no profit. So step one is sell them -- you're not laundering money, but if you're concerned about that, sell them on an exchange that requires verification so you have a paper trail. The anti-money-laundering laws are heavily devoted to paper trails.
Third, based on said profit accountant will tell you how much to send in.
@_date: 2013-09-24 21:41:41
I was just doing profit modeling not an hour ago -- I have a crapload of BFL singles showing this week -- negative ROI out the gate. Even with the performance/power improvements virtually all miners deployed after about February are going to be negative profit devices unless the value of BTC goes up. 
If the hardware was *free* a CoinTerra miner would have negative profit due to power costs by mid-2014. The window is rapidly closing.
@_date: 2013-01-29 21:17:33
*Second* batch? 
The first batch was 300, 60 GH/s units, or 18 THash/s. The network hash rate hasn't moved from 20-25 TH/s for quite a while.
They could plug 50 in for simultaneous testing, light them up for an hour with a "it's us" announcement and put to rest any doubts about reality. Instead we get "let's hope Jeff receives his unit before batch  starts selling..."
@_date: 2013-03-09 00:12:10
Thanks! It made it.
@_date: 2013-02-05 23:38:23
It is, BFL said the reason for the most recent delay was switching the packages of the ASICs to BGAs so widen the thermal margin. The new board layout in the OP link the ASIC spots are BGA, the one you pasted is the old layout (which looks like maybe TQFP -- in any case, on the edges of the chip package rather than the bottom.)
@_date: 2013-02-06 17:08:40
Let's look at it another way, taking the number of chips out of the equation.
The promised performance of a BFL single is 60 GH/s. BFL has over 10K orders based on invoice numbers (we don't know how many are singles vs jalapenos vs minis, but let's assume they're all singles. We also don't know how many have been cancelled, but let's just assume it's 10K units of singles for simplicity,)
60 GH/s * 10,000 = 600,000 GH/s, e.g. 600 TH/s. 
Yet another way to look at it:
If we assume current network hash rate is 24 TH/s, 400 BFL singles (or Avalon units for that matter) at 60 GH/s can match the network rate, e.g. 400 units will produce 24 TH/s and they can double the network hash rate to 48 TH/s. 
10,000 units / 400 units per network hash rate = 25
So if 10,000 units ship, the network has rate should go up to 26 times what it is now. 26 * 24 TH/s = 624 TH/s.
I think the math is right. When the ASICs come online in volume there will be a massive increase in difficulty to compensate.
@_date: 2013-03-08 20:09:03
Not even remotely. 
GPUs work for bitcoin because they're programable, and one of the programs can be computing hashes for a block, which is why they were used to mine.
ASICs are implemented in hardware and are not programmable. They do only hashes on a block, which is why they're faster and cheaper per gigahash/sec. 
@_date: 2013-02-23 17:49:25
Sort answer, until they actually ship, and have a few weeks of shipments behind them, we won't really know. I'm in the same boat.
For some time they'd been maintaining they'd be "caught up" on all pre-orders in 6-8 weeks after shipments started, but I've noticed the language has softened a bit with them saying things along the lines of "after a few weeks we should have a good idea of production rates." 
Based on either the number of chips or order numbers, it looks like there's about 10-20,000 systems. Taking the lower number, they'll have to manufacture and ship about 200 a day to make that happen in 8 weeks. That's a pretty big number given what equipment they have in-house.
It's not unrealistic if they ship the first unit on March 1 (which may be a stretch) that the later preorders wouldn't ship until July. They'd still need to build/ship more than 60 units a day to make that happen, or even more if the number of orders are higher.
@_date: 2013-03-01 19:49:46
Exactly, two months ago my puny 1 GH/s rig was making $36/mo, now it's making ~ $74. I'll take the hit in difficulty until my ASIC miner shows.
@_date: 2013-02-18 04:24:19
That's my assessment as well, between Avalon's first batch (which was supposedly 300 units at 60 GH/s, or 18 TH/s, of which we might have seen 5 TH show up so far) and BFL's roll-out, which sounds like it'll take about 2-3 months to deliver ~ 10,000 units, it should be relatively slow. But even factoring in delays, I'm pretty sure by mid-summer we'll see hash rates that make GPUs unprofitable.
I'm on the BFL preorder list nearer to the end than the start, obviously my personal preference is for as slow of a ramp as possible.
@_date: 2013-04-15 17:34:52
The problem with that theory is the trade on froday that started the fall in gold was 400 tons. Cyprus' entire holdings are 3.5% of that.
What's going on is all machinations within the paper gold market, and disconnected from physical and central bank gold (though central banks raising gold lease rates to the bullion banks may be peripherally connected with the paper sell-off.)
@_date: 2013-09-25 18:02:45
My profitability expectation is... negative, and my ASICs go online the end of this week. I'm just trying to minimize losses at this point.
It just gets worse the longer you wait, irrespective of how efficient and cheap the hardware gets. With reasonable assumptions on network growth, by July or so even with free hardware and electricity at 1 cent a KW/h you can't mine profitably.
@_date: 2013-09-19 19:50:41
There's a third explanation, which is they had relatively few orders in the months after the initial offering.
It is very odd, however, that in the past week they've gone from shipping 0.5 to 2 days worth of singles per day to 2+ weeks worth per day. 
@_date: 2013-03-01 21:47:37
Wow, there's a whole lotta hatin' in that thread! 
I somewhat agree with their sentiment (if I'd bought bitcoin instead of pre-ordering ASICs, I'd make more than the ASIC probably will) I agree more with yours -- GPU mining isn't dead just yet, and the longer Avalon/BFL take to deliver en masse, the longer I'll keep my GPUs online.
@_date: 2013-02-06 04:16:12
No one has a BFL unit. Avalon shipped a handful in the past couple weeks. BFL is claiming first shipments possibly as early as next week, though likely two weeks from now unless there's a glitch, which is 100% possible.

But I agree, them coming to you and telling you about bitcoin and mt gox's role... That's pretty strange.Stranger still is the timing -- 60 days is ancient history in banking. 
I think I'd be more inclined to be nice and ask why they went through such an effort, to find out if mt gox is on a flagged list, if _you_ are on a flagged list, or whatever.

Even if I did, however, it would not be a stupid answer. If you are, in fact, investing overseas in amounts over 10K, you had better be filing said form. What would be stupid would be to evade taxes, especially doing so involving transfers that are automatically reported to the IRS.
@_date: 2013-01-30 03:01:58
This was discussed last week, basically you'd count the BTC mined towards income, but you also deduct mining expenses (rig, electricity, rents) to determine profit, and then pay the appropriate tax on that. Given the current state of mining, very few ventures are actually profitable.
@_date: 2013-01-18 22:02:57
Yes, of course. I should have been clear and said "pay taxes on the BTC mined that year."
I got curious and did additional reading, apparently in the US bitcoin's status is pretty much settled as a commodity, and you would not pay taxes at all until a post-mining tax event happened (eg the BTC got traded or converted.) You would also compute the costs of mining against the value of the BTC mined, which in the current environment would be pretty close to a zero profit situation.
@_date: 2013-07-11 18:08:27
Actually it wasn't -- prior to early this year, BFL had already delivered FPGA hardware, bASIC was talking big, and Avalon looked sketchy as hell. When I went through the process of buying an ASIC miner late last fall, BFL looked like the safest bet out of the companies that were doing ASICs.
It's clear in hindsight a lot of companies that were attempting to build ASIC miners were in over their head, including BFL, but a year ago it wasn't quite so evident. 
At this point I'm operating under the presumption that I've lost my preorder cash to BFL, and they'll join bASIC after having delivered a bunch of Jalapenos and a handful of singles before cashflow and development spending bankrupts them.

I don't think anyone knows for sure, but the "old" schedule (late January ship date) they had indicated everything would be shipped by the end of march, so let's call it two months. I believe they also said something along the lines of 70,000 chips (realize the board in the OP takes 6, so that's 10K or so boards.) 10K/9 weeks is about 1K a week roughly, or about 200 per business day. Lots of assumptions and rounding, but that seems like a reasonable approximation to me.
@_date: 2013-03-11 20:15:36
Well, they burned one wafer to speed up the test process, so that may be a part of it. I work in the semi industry, and their timelines are consistently optimistic (ha!) but  every single problem they've encountered has been something fairly common, which lends them credibility (as far as developing actual technology, not business practices!) in my opinion.
Since they've said the chips tested functional, bringing up the boards is really the only "glitch" left. They're also quoting and April 1 ship date now, so they've actually got some padding in their schedule for a change.
I keep waiting for the next delay, but based on what they've shared, they've got to be pretty close to deploying. Unfortunately based on the wafer count, I estimate they can only build about 700 systems or so off this batch.
@_date: 2013-01-31 20:35:01
Mining hardware evolved from PC CPUs, to using GPU mining (still common), and FPGA rig mining. The FPGA designs pointed to the last step, having hardwired application specific chips (ASICs) do mining, and those products are just coming online now.
The big deal is performance, a single ASIC unit from Avalon (and presumably Butterfly labs when they ship) provides 60 Gigahash/s of processing, which is roughly 60 times the performance of a typical GPU mining rig.
With current network hash rates, just 300 ASIC systems would basically double the rate. Depending on how much you believe, we could be seeing thousands to tens of thousands of ASICs coming online in the next two months, which completely re-scales the bitcoin ecosystem with respect to mining.
@_date: 2013-09-25 17:52:01
Things start looking pretty ugly mining wise by mid-2014 if the hashrate continues on the path it's on. I was reviewing my mining plans earlier this week and even with the most power-efficient ASIC hardware being given to you for free, after July or so if you don't have truly zero-cost power, profitability will be negative.
I *do* think miners have resolved to not make money in a conventional sense. You have a number of larger financial entities getting into the market, and my sense if they're not counting on conventional profitability to make it, but hoping that long term changes in exchange rate compensate for negative profitability in the short term. 
As it stands I'm not even working for breakeven on my ASIC hardware at this point -- just trying to minimize my losses. Anyone buying mining hardware now either has some interesting assumptions or a non-traditional business model.

This is the way to do it. Optionally, you can use the Armory client and do a cold-storage wallet and/or rather than use a liveCD, dedicate a cold system (I use an old netbook with the wifi card physically removed from it.)

This is a computer security issue, and not a bitcoin issue per se. If you're going to have a significant amount of bitcoin, it's only sensible to keep it in a cold hardcopy wallet offline or to use an air-gapped PC (no network connection possible) to manage it. I have an old netbook with the wireless card removed and USB key live OSs for that purpose.
What happened here theoretically could happen with the normal banking system if someone installed a screencap/keylogger trojan on his PC.
Simply put, don't store everything in one wallet (spread it around) and keep valuable wallets in an offline state, and theft is virtually impossible.

It's a covered loan, so to clarify, they're borrowing BTC against a covered account (say, an account that has enough USD in it to buy the BTC outright at the price it's been borrowed at). So the loan in BTC, but it's only loaned against a known-good asset. If the borrower of the BTC defaults (e.g. doesn't return the borrowed BTC) the USD is forfeited, so it's just like the BTC they borrowed was sold to them.
This is standard practice with stocks. Uncovered shorts, on the other hand, are frequently used to manipulate pricing and create unnecessary risk, and with the bitcoin model, I'm not sure any same entity would permit uncovered shorting of bitcoins due to the risk.
I agree with the notion that shorting should be allowed -- people who don't understand it may thing it's a bad thing, but it actually provides a price floor, as it results in higher demand as prices go lower to cover the short sale.

IANAL or IANATA (Tax accountant) but I deal with taxes along these lines.
As long as you paid taxes on the income to buy the bitcoins, and you didn't do anything super shady (ie bought over 10K USD in cash), you should have no problems on the legal front.
For taxes, the basic calculation is profit -- the price you sell your bitcoin hoard for less what you paid. How that profit is taxed is best left to your tax accountant, as it could be unearned income, long term capital gains, short term capital gains or something else. I can only speak to long term capital gains as I've dealt with that, and it's presently ~20% of the profits.
Super simple example: you bought $1000 USD of BTC at $2, i.e. 500 coins. You sell tomorrow at $35, making $17,500 on the tranaction. The difference (17500 - 1000, or $16,500) is what you pay taxes on. At a 20% rate, when you file your taxes, you'd send in $3,500 for the profits from bitcoin. I don't know for sure, but I would imagine when you cash out, if the amount is over $10K, one or more of the banks in the chain is going to file a report to FINCEN/etc on the transaction. This doesn't mean you broke any laws, it's just a requirement for them to comply with the law.
Nothing about bitcoin is illegal, and as long as you can explain the source of funds and pay taxes on profits, you have nothing to worry about.
You really want to get a tax accountant to handle this, as there's different ways the profits can be categorized, and he'll know best how to handle it and file the appropriate forms.

It's interesting to me that so many of them are tagged with the same date/time (Oct 23rd at 03:35 or so.) I have to imagine that entire group is connected.

I agree, but it does depend ultimately on their goal. I did an analysis of payback periods and basically the first two weeks of delivery are what matters, after that ASICs rapidly approach the same situation as GPU miners today -- and that's where the power/stability/headroom come in, since the late to the party ASICs are going to be barely profitable and will need low power and good stability to run for the *years* it will take to break even.

That's 0.2 coins per day *now.* With the rate difficulty is increasing, by June a 60 GH/s miner will be generating less than 0.02 coins per **month** and will be below operating cost break-even with electricity at 1 cent/KWh. Hence my statement "by July or so even with free hardware and electricity at 1 cent a KW/h you can't mine profitably."
[Here are the calcs with everything being free but power.](
It all hinges on the growth rate of the difficulty, but given the trend and a whole bunch of new ASIC suppliers going online between now and the middle of next year, I think the genesisblock's calculator isn't a bad estimate. If my hardware breaks even I'll be a happy man, but I seriously doubt it will.

This argument holds up for small amounts of bitcoin, but it doesn't for large, exchange-moving amounts. A large financial entity -- let's say someone who wants to hold a very large amount of BTC, mirroring the Winklevoss twins -- would move the market if they bought instead of mined. So for a large player it may still make more sense to mine, even at a loss, if they expect a large move in the exchange rate relative to mining costs.
Based on reasonable assumptions, BFLs ASIC's stopped being able to pay for themselves this past month unless you have access to virtually zero-cost power -- and that's at the lower pre-order price (ie before the doubling that happen earlier this year.) I hope you're right though, as I have ten singles that I'd like to at least break even on.

Final assembly it supposed to happen at their offices, as far as the chip fabrication, they haven't said but given that it's 65nm, it could be TSMC, UMC, or GlobalFoundries, but I'd put my money on TSMC. Bumping, test, packaging are being done in California. Understandably BFL isn't giving out vendor names, life is hard enough as is.
@_date: 2013-01-22 23:16:28
I do hobby-level GPU mining, and have a few BFL units on order; I have little doubt I will barely break even on the BFL units and will have to invest a year or more waiting for them to produce enough bitcoins to come anywhere close to the purchase price.
When you perform some basic modeling of ASIC rigs coming online, if you're not getting a system in the first couple weeks, breakeven could be a year or more away, if ever (unless you have free power.)
You're better off buying coins now, or even better, last week.

Difficulty is adjusted according to network hashrate so that output is ~ 6 (ninjaedit: blocks) an hour. When the ASICs show, difficulty will increase rapidly, and likely well past 10X. 
The first ASIC units will rake in BTC until the difficulty adjustment, and then the payouts will slow; as more ASICs arrive the payout will slow even more. "Super rich" is a stretch. 
This is why the "race" for ASIC is happening, whoever gets there first gets the biggest payout. After that, though, not so much. 
Simple thought experiment: current network hashrate is ~ 20Thash/second. Let's say that's being done today with GPU miner rigs running at 1 Ghash/s -- that's 20,000 GPU rigs working at once, generating ~ 6 blocks per hour, with the block reward of 25. This means One miner gets 1/20000th of the bitcoins mined, which is 24 hours*6 blocks per hour * 25 BTC per block (3600 BTC per day),  or about 0.18 BTC per system per day. That's $2.52 @ $14 USD / BTC.
Going by BFL's claimed 60 Ghash/sec for a single SC unit, just 333 units would be able to meet the current network hash rate ~20Thash/s. If every GPU miner switched to a single SC, we'd be seeing a network hash rate of 20000*60Ghash = 1200 Thash/s, basically 60X the current network has rate. After a short time, difficulty will adjust so that only 6 blocks per hour are generated at that higher hash rate. In this environment, a minirig at 1.5Thash/s would represent just 0.125% of the hash rate, and would generated 0.125% * 3600 BTC per day -- about  4.5 BTC or $63 USD. It would take nearly 16 months to pay for itself assuming power was free.
Profitability will depend solely on how many and how fast ASIC rigs deploy, the faster/more deployment, the less profitable. The early adopters will likely make some money, most will likely be in the same boat as GPU miners are today, profitable with free power, otherwise not.

That's not how mining works. There's essentially a constant flow of BTC over time (with block adjustments reducing it, but that happens very slowly). So fewer BTC aren't mined.

I'm doing partial solar on my current rig, but the power consumption is too high to run it 24/7, which I am doing just so I have something to show at the end of the day. It's really just for play at this point given how low the returns are.
I ordered some BFL ASIC units to use a diversion loads at my cabin, which has a 2.5 KW array and about 6-8 KWh of daily excess capacity going to waste when I'm not there. Even with free power it's iffy if they'll break even, but I liked the idea.

Simple example: a basic dual GPU mining rig runs about 1 GHash/s. The basic ASIC rigs are 60 GH/s. From announced preorder volumes, when all are done shipping we're probably looking at a network hashrate of 600 THash/s (ie 600,000 GH/s) when it's currently ~ 30 TH/s (30,000 GH/s). ANd it goes up from there.
Approximately 3600 BTC are produced a day by design. Today a GPU miner will get 1/30,000th of those 3600 bitcoins (about 0.12 bitcoin per day.)
When the ASICs are completely shipped, that GPU share goes to 1/600,000 or 0.006 BTC per day. At $25USD per BTC, that's 15 cents per day, which likely won't even cover power. If power is free the GPU rig technically is still profitable, but it's earning less that $5 USD a month.
A single ASIC share will be 60/600,000 or .36 BTC per day. That's about $9 a day, or $270 a month. So it'd still break even in under six months, which tells me that we'll see ASICs keep selling and the hashrate keep going up until it doesn't break even in a reasonable timeframe. (By my math, breakeven hits 18 months at a 2,300 TH/s rate, or nearly 100X what it is today. At that time, a GPU miner will make 0.0012 BTC a day, or 0.03 USD (three cents!)
GPU miners are toast. But right now, with some ASICs, they're still worthwhile. I doubt they will be by July.
