“Be Fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.”
Following Warren Buffets advice, this is a buying opportunity.  The media is creating fear.  Per Buffet rules…it’s a buy.
WAYYYYY to much effort is being made to drive this price down.  Who does that?  Why do that?  Money is not made by suppressing price unless they are going long and know if will bounce right back with 100% certainty.

People who are aware of 64bot routinely jump in front of it.  It's not a bad strategy unless the 64bot pulls the wall.  You have to know when it will actually fill. I can tell you it rarely fills.

Been in since 2013.  Flipped over the same coins hundreds of times over day trading.  It's all just profit at this point.  I buy more when it goes down.  I never dump at lower that the average of total coin buys.  Strategy has worked solid for many years now.  If no one sells a coin for less than 4200 then the price remains fixed.  If the order book sell is zero coins for sale... explain how price drops please.  It cannot.

So your risk model accounts for btc going to zero?  I would say that's not an accurate risk model.  I have explained my situation and decided that it's worth it to me since I see the lieklyhood of reward far outweighing my risk.  The risk is obviously different for everyone
@_date: 2017-09-17 00:33:35
so i just learned if you eat the entire wall of 64bot...it will start buying.  mount a larger wall and set a limit order sell 30 bucks higher  than whatever 64bot set its price.

@_date: 2017-09-16 14:19:21
Best way to make money is when the opposite occcurs.  Example the price on bitfinex is 4065 and the price on gdax is 4000.  When this occurs you will typically see a massive sell wall form on Gdax at around 4010.  At the same time you see a buy wall at 50 or more coins.  The buy on gdax will fill, sell wall will drop and proce will pop to 4065.  Get your limit sell order in asap as soon as you get your fill on gdax and dump at 4060.   Hope I explained that correctly.  Happens very frequently.  Can make signifficant income but you loose coins in liue of fiat.  Continue the process until there is a major dip and pick up more coin.
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:29:31

prices across all exhanges are getting closer to leveling out.  when this happens the 64 walls on gdax will work in the opposite direction.  this is where you get fucking paid.  until then the 64 bot will keep creating traps and taking your coin.  pay attention and when you see the opposite happen...get your coins and limit sell to avoid fees.

When the price is back to 5k or more the noobs will realize that next time...just hold.  It takes getting burnt to learn.  I was burnt long ago and it taught me a valuable lesson.  It's why I never deviate from my strategy.  Tomorrow the price can pop past 5k.  I have a limit sell on gdax for 5499.  It will remain there until it fills.

@_date: 2017-09-16 07:07:32
Example the price on bitfinex drops to 30 or more lower than gdax be aware of false buy walls on gdax.  So let's say gdax is 4000 and bitfinex drops to 3940.  A buy wall goes up on gdax at 3990.  You see the buy wall and say....FUCK that bull trap I'm not buying!  These fuckers are not stealing my money..

Never pass.  Crypto is the gateway to universal basic income.  The supporters are the top 1% of the top 1%.  I have made several posts about it.  It's why I never sell at a loss.  They want it to succeed and have more control than anyone else...so it will succeed.  With that being said, be aware the original blocks will be distributed globally   that will take a while and I have zero clue what it will do to long term price.
@_date: 2017-09-17 21:58:33

I can respond to 3 now.   I do hold coins when I know it's going down.  As a trader I can now see the damage done by pump and dumps.  Cryto will not survive if we keep stealing money from noobs.  So in order for me to make money long term, myself and many others are holding through the FUD in an effort to make more later.  You seem to be fixated on immediate reward...which I am not.  I have to write a paper to respond to all your points.

@_date: 2017-09-14 18:29:31
I have never understood why anyone would ever sell at a loss.  Just switch to a long position...which is like 2 weeks in the world of crypto.
@_date: 2017-09-16 14:27:41
the sell wall is your insurance that someone is doing arbitrage with a cubic shitton of coin.  An orchestrated event for which they are certain to get paid.  You basically "steal" a portion of their profits.

@_date: 2017-09-15 02:56:06
Look at the book for 64 sells and 128 buys
@_date: 2017-09-15 22:07:23
watch it until you understand it. also watch bitfinex for a price spread compared to gdax of over 20.  most of these walls are fake to convince you agains your buy or sell position.  once you inderstand it you can smash them and pretty much print free fiat.  word of caution...sometimes they fill.  you have to look at the orders on muptiple exchanges.  i use bitcoinwisdom.com in a second window.

@_date: 2017-09-19 12:19:25
its manipulates the market by posting buys and sells that rarely fill. it runs a wall of 64 coins and is easily identified in the gdax order book. on occasion if you time an order correctly, you can eat away coins.  if you can eat the entire sell wall, the bot automatically buys its programmed level, 64 coins, and pushes the price up 25 to 30 per coin.  so if you can eat the bot, you can limit sell 64 coins a few seconds later at a profit of 25 to 30 per coin.

Been in since 2013.  Flipped over the same coins hundreds of times over day trading.  It's all just profit at this point.  I buy more when it goes down.  I never dump at lower that the average of total coin buys.  Strategy has worked solid for many years now.  If no one sells a coin for less than 4200 then the price remains fixed.  If the order book sell is zero coins for sale... explain how price drops please.  It cannot.

I answered your question 9 different ways.  I would not sell for a loss if a major group was dropping coins tomorrow.   I actually believe in crypto, have an understanding of it as well as the banking industry.  I don't do anything out of panic ever.     This FUD is designed to shake confidence.

People were saying "watch out, 5k is over valued" last week. You claim that was FUD. 
-I never said 5k price was FUD
Then the price drops 2/5 in 24 hours the next week. Is that still FUD, or do you re-evaluate your thinking when something goes against it?
-I have not come across any scenario to make me reevaluate going long and holding.  If I see a facctual event that I feeel will impact long term pricing, yes I would reassess my risk/reward potential. 
If someone gave you concrete proof that a major group was going to drop coins at 3500 tomorrow, would you still keep your coins at 4500? Knowing it's a sure thing you can get them at 1000 less the next day?
-I feel this is a silly question.  Yes I would always reevaluate if it got me more coins. Notice I said more coins...not more fiat.
That's a totally fair move, you're looking long road and not paying any attention to day to day. But I think it really would affect how people take your advice to know where you stand.
-I haver made it abundandly clear I am long on bitcoin but that doesn't mean I won;t make 20 trades a day in a bull market.

A wall is just more than 50btc at a certain price point.  It can be one person or multiple people.  Sell wall is a red wall which can push price down and prevent buying.   Buy wall is the opposite.  This is how bull and bear traps are set.

Everchanging sell and buy walls like 10 or and 10 under current price.  If I am in a fiat position..I ALWAYS try to get coin from the bot.  The bot wall pulls fast but you can still pull coin from it.  Funny thing is that the bots are programmed to rebuy coin if it looses it's initial balance.  If you can eat the entire bot it pushes price up on the exchange.  Slam a limit sell real fast and you can pull like 30 bucks a coin in profit.  If you have 10 coins that 300 bucks profit for approx 2 min of work. Requires timing and being logged into 2 laptops for faster execution

never been challenged for obvious reasons.  they don't want factual evidence posted...and they already know i eat the bot.
@_date: 2017-09-15 21:35:08
becasue over the past several months i have spotted a consistent pattern in "sell" and "buy" walls.  The ccoin increment has been 64 on the sell and 128 on the buy.  It is either a bot run by the exchanges to  reduce arbitrage or a provate bot.  It could also be a bot funded by multiple people using an api.  Point is the bot is pushing you to take opposite action.  If you were ready to buy and market conditions show you should buy...a sell wall of 64
will appear.  Buy into that wall and watch it be pulled.  It's an efffort to control the market.
@_date: 2017-09-19 15:22:43
I want to land on the moon.  The bots run and take money form noobs and advanced traders.  If they lose money, they are less likely to invest again.  This market would be WAYYYY more stable and likely past 5k right now if it were not for these damn bots.  I have also made enough already from raping that bot to be a hodler.  If everyone understands how they work, they are less effective. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:14:14
I have no dilemma.  Watch the book for 64 and 128.
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:00:32

Only way to fight back is using the strategy I suggested.  100s of traders together can take the bots out.  If they lose money...they will stop the bot.

How you like me now?  I was correct.

@_date: 2017-09-19 04:49:53
gest a chase card at 0% for 15 months.  buy a coin.  take a micro loan from 401K if needed to pay back before rate expires.  if you have good credit and a stable income you should never need the 401k loan.  btc is a better investment.  she is corrrect but do it a smarter way.
@_date: 2017-09-17 18:39:41
100% certain it will.  If you see BTC and 3900 today...then you know i  won...lol

i have not seen the microbot strategy before.  i guess they are tying to be more stealth?
@_date: 2017-09-18 00:04:35
Exactly what I did.  I leberged the shit out of Chase at zero percent

get a bank account and have your parents sign.  get a credit/debit card
@_date: 2017-09-17 20:35:09
ahhh....a cushion of micro buy bots in front of the main bot now.  seems silly and ineffective
@_date: 2017-09-19 17:44:34
the bot never really wants to fill...but it does if you catch it a the right time.  they already modified it and it sits further up the book now.
@_date: 2017-09-19 14:42:25
Honestly, I kind of just gave them a blue print on how to stop it and even make a profit while doing it...lol.  My guess is doing what I suggested would reduce their risk exposure to the point it has no relevance.
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:17:34
he is running it at 32 now since I outed him last night
@_date: 2017-09-17 16:27:04
ok well how bout this....everyone uses the chase card to get instant btc.  then we sell it right away and use that money ot pickup shares in JPmorgan.  then we get voting rights and have Jamie ousted.  The only flaw in this plan is no one can pay back the credit card debt.  I think my original plan is better...
@_date: 2017-09-26 01:26:20
buy into his wall if you can.  the bot auto rebuys at market.  so if you can eat all 64, you kick up the price like 10.  then the bot rebuys kicking it up another 10 to 15.  slam a limit sell on the asss end like 30 seconds after you first buy for like 20 higher and you get yourself a  smooootthhhh 1200 bucks on a single trade in under a minute.  i did it to him a few times and then it stopping hitting the bottom off the book.  shit is just used now to manipulate market direction.

wose case scanrio bbitcoin dropped to 2k and for some reason I was not able to make month payments for 15 months.  Even it that heppened (and it would never) I could always borrow form my 401K up to 50k and pay myself back with 6% interest.  its a win for me no matter how you slice it.

@_date: 2017-09-16 01:45:03
sheep mentality. people buy when they see other large buys.  people sell when they see other large sells.  a false buy wall goes up and you decide to get in front of the larger order.  then the larger order gets pulled and a sell waall goes up.  all the sudden you are down 50 to 100 bucks per coin and you panic sell it.  
@_date: 2017-09-16 17:38:11

I offer no advice. I shared my strategy.  Watch the book for 64 and 128.  Be advised 128 may be split incrementally across multiple buy positions.  Graph it.

it is entirely plausible to run a 65 bot in the opposite direction of 64 bot.  Theoretically this would wash all profit and gain from both sides and let the market grow organically.  "Would you like to play a game?
