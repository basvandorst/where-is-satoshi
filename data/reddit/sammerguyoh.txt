I own a small restaurant and have to get change for my cash drawer everyday. The amount of brand new bills in the last two years is higher than I have ever seen. More often than not if you get a strap on singles, fives or tens they will be new and hard as hell to get out of the drawer one at a time.

I have a good friend that asked to borrow couple thousand bucks for a few weeks. Said sure, what's it for? He "needed" to take a vacation with his family. Nevermind the fact that this would be him taking unpaid time of of work. I had to tell him no and explain that of he didn't have the money now and was going to take a week off work, how was he gonna get the money to pay me back? He actually understood though.

He doesn't. But if you look at his hostory, it's pretty easy to tell he thinks he knows everything.

I was wondering about the electricity point just the other day. I wonder how much electricity is used for gaming. Counting all pcs, consoles, arcades, etc?

I was speaking more about the gamers that shit on cryptos because they cant afford a GPU. One of their biggest "arguments" is that mining cryptos is a waste of electricity.
