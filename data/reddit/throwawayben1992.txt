Bill Gates founded Microsoft, hired thousands of people, sold hundreds of millions of products, revolutionised the computing world.
Jeff Bezos founded Apple, providing hundreds of millions of people with a fast and easy way to purchase goods and provided a way for vendors to sell their products all throughout the world. 
Mark Zuckerberg created a social media platform which has more than 1.5billion monthly users.

This is a period of unprecedented hype and media coverage. The buying power is very strong at the moment but it could easily dwindle. Bad news, regulations, exchange insolvencies, hacks, huge fees, a backlogged mempool coupled with tether manipulation, future trading, exchanges crashing ect could easily lead to a mass exodus the likes we've never seen. Remember we're dealing with much larger sums of money now, people have far more on the line. It'll be much harder to hold this time round than previous dips knowing that so many people are dealing with life changing sums of money now.

Its not highly unlikely at all. I mean look at the USA now, left the paris climate agreement, recognised Jerusalem as Israels capital. Donald Trump isn't your typical president. 
Its likely in my opinion that the USA will at some point clamp down on Bitcoin and will cite the use of it for tax evasion, money laundering, the funding of nefarious acts and the hugely wasteful energy usage as reasons for this.  Same goes for the European Union, who are perhaps more pro big banks than the USA. 
If they banned it now when maybe 2% of people actually own bitcoin, probably 1% actually understand it i don't think there would be too much resistance as it doesn't really affect anyone's lives. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:47:55
Why though? Why does Bitcoin deserve a valuation of 15k atm let alone 20k?

Because they are two separate markets. Sometimes there might be more money flooding in from America pumping the USD price up, there might be someone on the EUR exchange who dumps a huge amount causing price to dip a bit ect

I also think this is a huge problem, there haven't really been many solutions to the storage of Bitcoin. Other than dedicated hardware wallets, which lets face it aren't ideal. I really don't think the masses as a whole could be trusted with being in control of their own wealth, there would be too many horror stories of people losing their life savings by a mistake, to a hacker or getting kidnapped and forced to hand over BTC ect.
There in my opinion would need to be some sort of 3rd party storage but with that you lose all decentralization and a major unique selling point of bitcoin.

The difference between prohibition of Alcohol and Bitcoin is that most people don't have Bitcoin now, whereas most adults drank prior to the prohibition. If they were to ban Bitcoin it wouldn't affect the overwhelming majority of people whereas the ban on alcohol did affect most peoples lives. Governments could easily ban shops from accepting BTC and could easily shut down the bitcoin exchanges. Although i'm sure there would be a number of libertarian anti government people who would evade the ban but the majority of people wouldn't bother, there wouldn't be another incentive and too much risk.

Part of me thinks the reason that BTC hasn't tanked even lower over the past couple of weeks is because its often hard to cash out, what with high transaction fee's, long transaction times and exchanges crashing during critical moments. This all gives people an extra barrier and often more time to compose themselves, calm down and not succumb to the fear. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:29:04
I think BTC is over priced now seeing as it has very little real world usage, thats not to say it won't be worth more in the future. There is no guarantee that LN and atomic swaps are going to fix all the problems with BTC. By all means wait 1-2 years for these problems to be fixed but in the mean time other cryptos will look to take BTC's top spot.

@_date: 2017-12-03 22:38:03
I understand your point. In theory when BTC price falls the alt coin values in BTC should go up. However as i say, people panic and look to cash out by selling their alts which keeps the BTC value of alts down and also because BTC is by far the biggest cryptocurrency it is seen as the stabiliser, if BTC falls in value then confidence in cryptocurrencies as a whole also falls. When BTC price stabilises alt coins tend to go back up quite rapidly. 
In time you'd expect BTC to have less of a dominance and exchanges will open up USD trading pairs with alt coins.

On the flip side if you have a deflationary currency there is less incentive to spend meaning businesses make less, invest less, hire fewer people which results in less tax revenues and higher welfare costs. Because we have inflationary currencies it gives people incentive to not keep their money in the bank but invest in people, business, ideas in search for a greater return.

The way you get most alt coins is by exchanging BTC for alts. So when the value of BTC falls, the $ value of the alts also falls. People also cannot cash out with alts so when there is a panic people dump their alts for BTC to cash out.

In a way yes. The price of BTC on any given exchange is determined by the buyers and the sellers. The number of buyers/sellers and how much they're buying/selling varies on each exchange so the price varies. Recently there have been greater differences between exchanges, for example at one point a couple days ago the Korean exchanges were trading at $4000 more than the western ones, now its around $400-500 more. Over time as the price settles people will take advantage of the difference between exchanges (by buying on cheaper exchanges, transferring to exchanges where price is higher and selling) this will cause the prices to level out across the exchanges.

I'm really not so sure why people in this sub put so much focus on the inflationary aspect of fiat currencies. The rate of inflation is generally pretty low and can be predicted fairly accurately long in advance which gives people a number of options to plan for it.

I think you completely overestimate the desire for privacy. Most people aren't concerned in the slightest, they're concerned with their job, their family, paying the bills ect.

At the moment the Bitcoin world is filled with optimism, everyones happy, few people are selling but we all know how quickly that can turn. A piece of bad news can easily cause an exodus of people trying to escape BTC, then the bitcoin subreddits will be filled with pessimism. We could easily see a huge 40% retraction at some point.

People generally don't talk about their wealth here as it makes them a target for hackers. However there are undoubtedly a lot of people who have made significant amounts 1m+ and plenty who have made in the region of $10k-100k.

Tons of people have been asking me about BTC but only because its rising in price, not because they know a single thing about the tech. Literally none of them are aware about the hard fork coming up, they simply see the price rising and think "i want some of that", really dangerous time i think.

Still isn't even a big issue, people lose/get cards stolen all the time. They call their bank and cancel the card, if money has been sent the bank reverses it. You may be that concerned about protecting your $$ but 99% of people aren't concerned because the current system barely proves to be a problem.

Not really, they just want to be able to tax people and avoid money laundering.

There is no guarantee that you'll be able to buy back lower. I know its tempting to try and time the market but over the years its been those who have held who end up doing the best. 
Imagine if you buy BCH and suddenly it falls 20% and BTC rises 20%, you'll end up being able to buy much less than 1BTC back.

Slow down there cowboy!

Its not. I don't know how to tag my post as comedy (if thats possible on this subreddit)

In terms of % value this isn't anywhere near the biggest drop. I believe there have been a number of times where the price has dropped 50-80% in a short period of time. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:17:37
I think we'll easily go back to 9k within the next couple days. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:51:29
No i didn't?

Theres a difference between knowing how to use a shower despite not being a plumber and thinking about investing thousands in something you know zero about. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:24:21
The hype will die out, there is huge buy pressure at the moment. We saw how quickly it can fall earlier, if there wasn't so much buying pressure we'd have gone much lower. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:53:53
No its not. Taxation is a necessary part of a civilised society. Who would care for the elderly, the ill, the disabled? Who would pay for your police, nurses ect. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:12:44
This isn't the correction no. This is nothing on the huge sell offs which will result if there is bad news/panic. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:46:46
I highly doubt an episode of some terrible pseudo intellectual comedy show is going to have much of an effect.

The price is being pumped by asia though. Look at the price of btc in KRW on bithumb its $300 higher. 
@_date: 2019-06-27 04:37:45
Thank you, that site is very helpful.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:38:37
Yes but surely the exchange will come back online shortly? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:51:15
Thanks for the tip. I was rushing it and the first few fake tweet websites happened to all not be working so i was left with a pretty low grade option. And i totally forgot i could use inspect element. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:42:32
Np, my advice would be not to constantly check the prices and be relaxed about it, think long term. I ended up cashing out all of my BTC during the China banning saga a couple months back, sold at around $3200 :/ 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:12:22
Why is 6-7k now cheap? What has really changed? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:51:13
A big exchange being hacked, anti bitcoin regulation from a large country, a better competitor moving into the space. I think there are a number of things which could cause panic and a mass exodus. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:57:05
No dont. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:38:54
No. I mean if it takes 2 days to rise $1000 it can easily fall $1000 in just an hour.

What % of income do you pay in taxes if earning an average salary in Brazil? 
The state of your hospitals probably has a lot more to do with the corruption/poverty in your country rather than the fact you have a "free" healthcare system. Most developed nations in the world have free healthcare.

People also don't want the responsibility and risk of loosing their wealth either, which is why they use banks as a safe storage. You're kidding yourself if you think everyone is going to have control over their own wealth, would be a scammers dream.

Don't kid yourself into thinking CC are so insecure, 99% of the time when funds are stolen the funds are then reversed by the bank. Whats gonna happen when someones BTC is stolen? Who's gonna retrieve that for you then? You do realise those who target CC's would just move onto targeting BTC and would probably have much more success with less risk of being caught.

@_date: 2017-11-29 03:40:25
I wouldn't feel bad. Sounds like the only reason you ever bought BTC was to buy drugs, if you weren't buying drugs you wouldn't have bought the BTC. Also think would you have held the BTC all this time? Through all the ups and downs? Likelihood is you would have sold much much earlier. Its all in hindsight. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:31:26
I'm not sure why everyone here is all of a sudden acting like 10k is a good buy in price, remember a couple months ago we were at 3k. Bitcoin is long overdue a correction. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:14:46
What does that even mean? i swear people talk about "the market" and "free markets" without really understanding it. 
Lets imagine there is an 80 year old woman who is very frail, has no money and needs to be put in a care home. How does "the market" provide her with the care she needs?
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:08:47
These markets must be a dream for seasoned TA day traders.

You think appearing on the Big Bang Theory will lead to an increase in price? No wonder so many people think this is a bubble... How about real world application and usage? maybe that ought to be better.

There is every chance it'll go much lower. 
@_date: 2018-03-03 20:48:07
The gains made in BTC are dwarfed by the gains made in the financial industry, i doubt they really care at all at this point. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 01:16:16
What do you mean quickly? Its been a month + of steady decline

If you think crypto is going to be allowed to operate without being in accordance with anti-money laundering directives you've got another thing coming....
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:04:38
No but if businesses aren't allowed to accept it then it doesn't serve much purpose. Governments aren't going to allow people to launder money and evade taxes with ease.
