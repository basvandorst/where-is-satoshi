These numbers are just examples. It depends entirely on the volatility (beta) of the instrument. I don't know what the right answer is for bitcoin.

Different people have different threat models, which require different solutions. A paper wallet isn't protected from burglary, fire, or copying by anyone else with physical access. A brain wallet isn't protected from forgetting the password or disclosure of it if written down. A private key in offline digital storage is vulnerable to both of the above, and in online digital storage is vulnerable to hacking.
The correct balance depends upon what is being protected from and the amount under protection.

I should have said 'lists' not 'collates'. Good point though.

Edit: not strictly true, due to construction speculation and (probably) during pandemics. But robust property rights, obvious scarcity and being fundamentally useful are excellent attributes for an investment.

I hummed and haaed about how best to do cold storage for a while. Everyone's balance of needs is different, but they probably all have these conflicting requirements in common:
1. Protection against owner forgetfulness, fire, burglary, drive crash, recovery if owner passes away.
2. Protection against online theft.
3. Protection against offline theft.
For example, doing more to protect against 1) increases exposure to the risks of 2) and 3). So it's a careful balance. 
One way of balancing these requirements might be to use Armory offline with a printed backup in a safe place for heirs, and encrypted digital backup on offsite flash drives for fire protection. This is all very inconvenient and you quickly learn why a bank might be a useful institution after all.

If it was 2.6 BTC, don't worry it's there on blockchain.info. Which means it's yours as long as you have your wallet.dat and keep it safe.

I did it last week, it gave me peace. It was reassuring to go through the steps they suggest (pre-funding!) of deleting the digital copy and restoring from paper, creating public addresses online which match the offline ones etc.

Yes, for a period bitcoin-central.net redirected to instawallet. It looks like bitcoin-central will now be back up shortly.

This is called a *trailing stop*, and is typically set to sell at when a configurable % drop occurs. Until then, it follows the price rise up so you don't lose profits.
Now, here's the trick. If you set it too sensitive, say 5%, then it triggers right away due to noise. If you set it to say 15% then it's vulnerable to *bear traps* or *shaking out the stops*. If you set it to 25%, you're late to the exits and lock in your losses.

This is correct. A log scale equalises the representation of price doubling (or halving) regardless of entry point.

For offline use, it runs fine on a ten-year old laptop with 512MB ram and Ubuntu 10 LTS. Bitcoin-Qt client not needed.
