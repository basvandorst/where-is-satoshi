I'm an Aussie bitcoin fan, and I'm female. Only other person I've talked about bitcoin with and been positively received is my mother. 
Maybe it isn't bitcoin that women aren't into, maybe it's the idea of random internet meet ups.
@_date: 2014-01-20 02:14:49
I'd be keen if I was in the area, but I'm adventurous lol.

Not this little red hen - I used shopify with bit pay to set up my first online shop this week and set bit pay to send the btc straight to my wallet. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:09:48
This is a shame. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 08:28:19
What do you mean robust? 
Won't the map grow into something bigger?
@_date: 2013-11-09 18:26:47
Thank you so much, and that's a great idea. :)

We're not so backwards lol.
But seriously, we need our NBN, then we'll really join the next gen. Australia used to be the cradle of many scientific projects, advances in technology and research. The government is trying to undo this. Like the bullies suddenly allowed to run the school, and deciding to wail on the nerds, they are threatening the CSIRO, abolished the position of Science Minister and are in the process of completely screwing up both the NBN and our sovereignty as a nation with regards to trade and internet regulation.
Now that all sounds a bit depressing, but at least people are making steps towards monetary freedom and we can support things like the electronic frontiers foundation and we have a few senators asking the hard questions. Maybe as more Aussies push back against this tightening of government control we will see a wider uptake.

I open coinjar in safari.
They SMS me the deposit info, bank it and then buy.
@_date: 2013-11-09 20:08:53
hey, thanks! I don't have much either. Generosity is really about how big your heart is, not how big your wallet is. Know that this really means something to me. I plan on paying it forward when I'm in a better position.
@_date: 2013-11-02 21:13:47
Well it's hard to jam the cash into the computer... 
Seriously though, it has advantages in terms of avoiding currency conversion fees if you're in another country, the seller has the advantage of avoiding transaction fees if its something they might regularly accept credit cards or paypal for, you can use a qr code to facilitate easy payments and so set up a stall where people use their mobile phone to pay for stuff. There are plenty of reasons why someone might accept btc over other currency.
You should really read the link offered above by u/bithasher.

$5 - bought oct. 28th, refunded nov. 27th
$90 - bought oct. 29th, no refund as yet.
@_date: 2013-11-15 04:57:52
You're the one with the problem And you were pretty vague. I'm suggesting you try a small amount. I don't deal with them myself so it was purely suggested to try and find what the issue is. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 08:29:07
Well with a name like that he pretty much had to.
@_date: 2013-11-09 11:19:56
the tipbot can be used to tip! It's the future of redditing.
@_date: 2013-11-03 19:45:36
I'm already accepting bitcoin on my ebay sales. I just have a little paragraph on each listing saying the postage will be upgraded to express if paying by btc and to contact me directly if you want that option.
Sellers will move to btc if they want. Ebay can either incorporate it into their payment system (and fees) or miss out.
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:24:33
It would seem that as more people come to r/bitcoin these glib responses with no real contribution to the discussion will continue. 
Thanks for your insight.
@_date: 2013-11-09 18:27:32
hey, thankyou any way. I always say its the thought that counts!
@_date: 2013-11-03 00:30:58
Thank you so much :) 
Case in point right here guy.
@_date: 2013-11-03 01:03:18
Interesting! I'm still trying to find the article again a out it not being recognised as official currency.
It sounds like something a more experience legal/financial mind would have to look at, something the general accountant might not be able to sift through.
In the end, we may simply have to wait for a test case to see where the interpretation of the law falls.
@_date: 2013-11-09 18:33:15
omg, when I woke up this morning and went through my orangered I got blown away by the generosity shown here. Kovaniac suggested stashing some for the boy. I intend to! And he will definitely be hearing about uncle syriven (and the concept of kindness to strangers!)
I am absolutely gobsmacked, thankyou so much!
@_date: 2013-11-09 09:38:19
Homework is fun though :)
@_date: 2013-11-17 19:52:21
Perhaps you could contact one of the many microloans providers about helping them set up bitcoin donations?
There's a world vision one.
Or start your own in your local area? Even in my well off nation there is still homelessness &amp; children going to bed hungry as families struggle to make ends meet. A local microloan might be more than the $25 needed in Africa or Indonesia, but could set a family up to create an income stream of their own.
The addition of a bitcoin loan service help make their business truly global without the use of western union, paypal, etc.
I know that's what I hope to do one day, but that may be awhile yet. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 06:33:24
Because $0.25 is the accepted value of 1 internet.
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:56:28
Wow, sorry dude. I felt bad about my $90 (it was as much as i could afford) but that really sucks.
@_date: 2013-11-03 00:39:03
Hah! My bitcoin related earning so far are... 1 beer! But I offer it as an option when selling things online. I hope to see it take off to the point where taxation issues will be worth dwelling on, but so far as I understand its still not recognised as a currency so I'm not sure how one would even do tax with it.
Cheers, and here's to the future of btc!
@_date: 2013-11-10 05:42:58
Awww cute! Fair enough reason!
@_date: 2013-11-06 08:48:51
I tried once and jabbed myself in the eye.
So smooth.
@_date: 2013-11-03 10:29:51
Tell them its like your paypal balance. Most people know how to pay for things online. They may even remember when your only choice for shopping online was paying via bank transfer or credit card. Paypal seemed strange at first, but now most would say its easier.
Bitcoin will just make it that bit easier again.
@_date: 2013-11-29 08:41:57
Well I'm not the first to predict it. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 08:37:33
I see. Well first step might be collating the sites who've been listed in this subreddit . 
@_date: 2013-11-20 02:02:03
Same friend, if anything I'm glad for a little drop because I know these sub-$1000 days are numbered.
I don't know if it will get cheaper but I do know for certain it will get dearer. I'll leave it for other people to fuss about the daily movements, I'm looking long term.
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:57:08
I use coinjar but the price is always on the high side. It doesn't really worry me to pay a bit more on the upswing but as you watch the US$ price fall, you want to see coinjar reflect that a bit closer. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 05:53:23
Would be nice if u/eobot dropped in to explain, if they even can. There's really no knowing until the time is up.
@_date: 2013-11-30 05:50:50
Can you give the date you deposited? u/alwayslookingdown reports they were refunded but still have ltc in account. Do you have any coins in your account.
@_date: 2013-11-02 20:55:41
As a currency. You can tip people with it, fund a crowd-source project, buy goods and services or donate to charity.
@_date: 2013-11-20 02:04:19
magical internet money, not magical psychic money!
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:19:50
I got the same notice and moved it straight away.
And noticed the satoshi dice for the first time. I will admit, I made a dumb ass mistake and played and lost. I should have just left it. 4am is no time of day to be moving money, no mattter how urgent tipbot says it is.
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:40:30
challenge is opportunity, is that how it goes?
@_date: 2013-12-11 07:55:35
My kid goes to the school. :/ of course it is to help. To clarify I've already done the gift cards and canned food. Delivered yesterday morning. This was just a little something different. 
You may not believe that bitcoin has a future but I think a small amount in a wallet that will probably be forgotten about for 10 years isn't a bad bet. It might be worth 10c or it might be worth $10, but it would be theirs. 
I feel very bad for people like you. You must live where there is a lot of selfishness and corruption. Here we help, and if we can think of a new way to help, we try to do that to. 
@_date: 2013-10-28 04:11:12
Geez, up to over $200? I've always found their buy rate on the higher end, but what's with that!
It had been slowly creeping to the $150 mark for a while. Nekkminit $200!
Edit: and a quick look about days it's actually reasonable! Dammit, should have bought earlier.
@_date: 2013-11-09 09:36:45
I will check it out, I'm always keen to find out more.
And thankyou!
@_date: 2013-12-03 22:09:05
Would definitely leave her open to the old "put your tulips on this" joke.
Not trying to be a downer, my own kid's names are weird, to each their own and what not, but you have to consider everything a word means and whether you still think it's suitable is up to you.
@_date: 2013-11-09 18:45:20
I definitely think there's a case to argue that the legitimacy with which btc is viewed can be linked to it's acceptance by the average person. When a portion of a families budget is being converted into coin for spending, that's a major step.
The next one is when that portion is being *earnt*.
@_date: 2013-11-09 11:18:36
See folks, learning. Right here.
This is what makes this sub so great, people will share their tips and warnings. Thank you. And sorry u/bitswanitz a bit of closer looking leads me to believe it's not for me, but thanks anyways.
@_date: 2013-11-18 05:02:34
This is getting all a bit GTA. All picking out million dollar properties, buying a plane from Elitas.
In fact I'm calling it now: Bitcoin Barons DLC. A hacking mission that yields btc and links to the stock-market in game.
@_date: 2013-11-04 18:59:10
Thank you, that makes sense for me now.
@_date: 2013-11-30 06:23:59
And what classy friends he keeps!
@_date: 2013-11-06 21:38:49
It's already happening with the many alternative darknet markets on offer.  Business has gone on with barely any downtime. It's a game of whack-a-mole and LE thinks they've won because they have a few tickets.
@_date: 2013-11-16 08:08:21
I think I'll give it a try, if only to reinforce for myself a brief way to discuss it with the family.
I've got hubby on board. Next stop: the in-laws.
@_date: 2013-11-09 23:22:02
Excellent reminder!
@_date: 2013-11-04 18:50:22
For some purposes, people suggest tumbling coins. Can someone explain this process in more detail? Isn't a wallet anonymous enough, provided it isn't linked to your bank account.
And another thing, is your public wallet info safe to post? I see people on dailybtc's twitter stream posting it where anyone can see. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 22:08:17
What's this guy smoking? Did he buy it with bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:57:27
cash deposit showed with in 1 hour.
Still waiting for the conversion to go through 7 hours later.
@_date: 2013-11-09 11:24:01
haha, can we message him and see if he has any coins left to sell to me at $5!
Really though, I feel bad for these sorts of folks. They were trying to be smart and had no idea where bitcoin could wind up.
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:30:26
I think the bitcointip bot is revolutionary.
I see, not a business as such, but individuals supplementing their income by chatting for tips of very very very small amounts constantly. Every tweet, post and status update open for tipping. 
The key is uptake amongst existing business model, which will come, and is getting people used to the idea of tipping a poster, which is demonstrated here as do-able.
The end I see is people "working" at their internet leisure pursuits in a post-scarcity economy in which very few people fill traditional "jobs". 
But maybe I was just too excited reading [julian sarokin]( talking about abundance.
@_date: 2013-11-04 19:44:23
I'm a huge coffee fan &amp; support the ideals you've expressed here about sourcing ethically and paying a fair price for your green. I'm truly jealous! What a wonderful work-life balance, pursuing your passion, living in Bali and helping the people who grow and harvest (with much hard work!) that normally get so little in recompense. 
This really is what bitcoin represent to me, the opportunity to step around the people who are essentially just leeches on a process, there to make money &amp; nothing more, and give greater power to small suppliers and typically disempowered sections of the supply chain.
So, do you post to Australia? 
@_date: 2013-11-09 18:35:46
Thank you, and I will :) It's 5.35am here in Oz and he's wide awake haha, I love it. It's forced me to change my schedule for the better, that's for sure.
@_date: 2013-11-09 10:15:27
wow, thank you :) 
@_date: 2013-11-15 03:52:09
Why wouldn't it? 
Try moving a small amount first.
@_date: 2013-11-09 18:28:48
Will do. This sub is incredibly supportive of people starting a business and looking to incorporate coin.
