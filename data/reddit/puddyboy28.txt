This is like a big rule ..  
a drug dealer. never keep your stash of (dope) and your stash of (money) in the same place. you have a house for the money .. and you have a house for the dope. then you have another location for transactions. this guy blew it... amateur hour

I predict $1400 per coin around new years. 
but a stable hold around 850-900 after halving. 
just my predictions .. i am being optimistic.

also i mine bitcoin .. Im past my ROI so now i just collect everyday i don't care what price it hits now as long as its higher than what i bought in at. 
@_date: 2016-06-22 21:11:18
I got in at $412.. Not too worried at the moment .. I get paid every day :) team slow bucks baby !

yep. we could easily transfer the entire USD system value over to BTC to the decimal point. whatever fraction of a "whole" coin would be.

money money money .. its all about money. you pay your way for freedom. ATM is right next to the personal effects counter when you bail your fucking self out of jail. FU K THE PO LICE WE COME STRAIGHT FROM THE BLOCK CHAIN

why does it always sound like we forget ...like even though there is only 21 million coins since it is divisible by (whatever it is im too fucking lazy right now) really there are plenty of coin to go around for everyone. 
0.0000000000020 for example could be worth $200usd 
i think people forget about that...it seems... a lot. we keep looking over the decimal and not as it can be broken down past that.LOL 
but.. i got into it because fuck the banking system now. id rather make money with my money that actually moves up and down than getting basically 0.2% interest rates having my cash sit in a bank account doing nothing every year. 12k sitting in an account and the bank has the balls to send me a notification that i made $0.5 cents in interest ! thanks wells fargo go shove that nickle up your fucking ass !

@_date: 2016-06-23 20:19:36

I auto buy 5$ in bitcoin every day ... to me its UN noticeable such a small amount of money being taken from my bank account. in for the long haul ... 
@_date: 2016-07-25 20:04:41
When people say "how can i pay you" .. i always say .. visa mc or discovery (square) .. paypal ... or ... bitcoin. the last one they almost always say .. don't know what that is or ask how.. i dont want to get into a discussion so i just say never mind ... so many people still have no clue 
@_date: 2016-07-01 13:37:08
yes .. coinbase allows you to set up auto buys .. daily hourly weekly monthly ... i know everyone isnt a fan of coinbase.. but i use it.. once i get a certain amount of coin i move it to my "vault" . looking into getting a trezor 
@_date: 2016-07-25 19:58:11
nice chart ..

@_date: 2016-07-01 19:32:27
honestly my idea behind it is just just acquire as much coin as possible. a lot of us still look at the BTC like this or forget
1.000000000000 = 1  
instead of like this 0.000000000010 = 1
that's the beauty behind it

Its a good way to save money too.. i set up a separate savings account. in my wells fargo .. every day it transfers $15 from checking to savings.. after one year do the math .. $5,475.. to some people that amount of money being moved out of your debit account is UN noticeable.. its not like your spending it its just saving itself.. you learn to live a different lifestyle depending on how much per day you transfer.. but it is pretty cool at the end of the year to have 5k sitting in your bank from just saving the hardest part is the temptation .. but you can also set it up so you cant see this account when you log in .. I did it one year @ $15 a day .. then another year  a day ... if you can do more do more.... (excuse my shitty grammar and typing)

pretty simple goals in life right now. 
@_date: 2016-07-08 14:00:21
people who say its stupid to spend money on _____ or _____  think its dumb because they haven't experienced the mind set of being able to live this/that type of lifestyle.. some people are just in another league and choose to never settle for less and get what they want in life that's why... there is vip and general admission. pick a line .. live that life.

I will never forget the day an old co-worker told me about BTC and it was only $12 a coin.... 
we both did research into it that day and couldn't wrap our heads around the whole mining and profitability of it we were both skeptical and didn't see possibilities it held at the time.
 *tear falls*

"save for a few isolated cases of indecent exposure and public urination in south Florida."
