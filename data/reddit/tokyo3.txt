very simple, this chip they will sell to you, mines with energy you pay for and sends 75% of the profits it generates to them 21 co, so you become a free miner for them, and they wont even pay the electric bill, because you will

337,799,265 GH/s todays hashing power not enough? so we need to buy their chips and pay for more energy to make them rich lol , this is stupid, its funny how they evade all questions about mining and the 75% profit they are looking for at no cost

so this is a hardware botnet running on hardware you pay for, with energy you pay for, giving away 75% of the profit from millions of devices at no energy cost for 21, I wonder if the 25% will even cover the energy cost for the user

every incentive would come from your own electric bill and the profits they took from you, it makes no sense

destroying network neutrality is something good? wallet more important than mining when they are taking a 75% profit from it? I'm really starting to find this 21 project really annoying

that chip will hardly pay the energy it consumes once you think 21 takes 75% of the profits for them
@_date: 2015-05-22 08:47:21
they expect you to pay for the chip and the energy it consumes, the 75% profit becomes at no cost for them

this abusive centralized miners 'club' sucks for me, but anyone can have fun getting ripped of ;)

I got this message today on my regular pc, but this HAS TO BE on btc-e side because I'm getting it also on a fresh linux live stick system with plain firefox and no extensions, so it's impossible I have malware installed, they should check this out because it has to be a bug on their side
