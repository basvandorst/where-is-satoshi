We are not talking only about big investors, I'm sure most of the people here are not that big.
Imagine someone who has worked hard to save, say $100k (or whatever sum you feel is significant). If they keep their money in the bank:
A. Bank account can get freezed anytime, for a prolonged duration. This can happen easily if a "suspicious" transfer was made, during a divorce, or if there's a lawsuit against them that has ties to money laundering, terrorism, extremism, whatever. Even if the person will turn to be completely innocent, the freezing of their bank account can have disastrous consequences. It's possible that with a frozen account they won't be to pay their medical bills or to hire a lawyer. 
B. The funds can be completely lost to some ridiculous lawsuit. And yes, there are ridiculous lawsuits, sorry to burst your bubble. I don't want to lose my life's earnings because a thief broke into my house and broke his leg falling from the stairs. Alternatively, they can be lost to medical bills  - our person gets unconscious without insurance, gets helicoptered away with thousands in medical bills.

I'll only get suicidal if it goes above 25k before my paycheck.

Try googling the number of foreclosures on homes, huge lawsuits, huge medical bills etc. I had a relative who lost a $600k lawsuit and had all his belongings seized, down to the last sofa (and he wasn't a drug dealer or something like that at all, he was a lawyer actually). He died shortly after that, and the stress has probably contributed to his death. In USA some lawsuits tend to be particularly huge for no reason. And this thread looks like people here have no net worth at all and/or are ridiculously optimistic. Because if you have at least some, you are afraid to lose it.

I'd just use qiwi visa card instead of cash, it's 0% and almost everything I buy regularly can be bought with a visa card - groceries, clothes, internet, food delivery, etc.

I really thought that the numbers next to the words mean the order, but it doesn't seem to be the case. Although "try post way just course like" does give the correct checksum, but the balance is 0 and has no transactions. So does "fee help tape tail time want" ("z=" numbers).
I've highlighted the numbers and most (not all probably!) of the bip39 words. Maybe it helps someone.

Regarding Russia, not really. Right now Bitmex price is $6992 and you can exchange 1 btc -&gt; 473795 rub qiwi, which is less than 1% difference, not perfect, but much better than OP's 5% and you don't have to go to Western Union office.

I love the idea. In Saint\-Petersburg \(Russia's second largest city\) anyone can easily buy a billboard for a month for less than $800. I'm sure there are other big cities around the world where billboards are relatively cheap, but could make a significant impact. In time, we could even move to TV campaigns! We just need someone to make a good and transparent website to raise the money.
