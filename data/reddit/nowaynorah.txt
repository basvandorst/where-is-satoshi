Pretty much exactly why I said I am not looking for a debate on left vs right or the pro's of libetarianism. Was simply asking for some sources that share a similar world outlook as I do. If someone asked for sources on the opposite end of the spectrum I could provide a pretty exhaustive list. 
[Here's an article]( by Varoufakis (who I generally really respect) on his view on bitcoin

Almost everyone says BCH is a valid project if they did actually just go their own way. That's not what they are doing and it's not what people are moaning about.

I don't know many people that would consider modern American styled libertarianism as left wing. Either way, the / was meant as and/or.

You were actually one of the people I was referencing in my post. I massively appreciate all the work you do and love to read your tweets but I don't agree with a lot of your politics.

Just a few points off the top of my head:
* Brings better accountability to government spending (massively applicable in rich and poor countries alike)
* Allows people to travel more easily (personally a huge factor for me)
* Will eventually provide better and more equal opportunities for people not in the 1st world
* Gets rid of/curtails a massively corrupt banking sector that can use their entirely undemocratic power to pressure entire nations (see Greece)
* Brings efficiency gains and potential transparency to world trade and taxation (business may need to provide accurate, traceable expenditure and profit accounts)
* Global store of value (I live in South Korea at the moment. If war were to breakout most of my wealth would instantly take a nosedive without bitcoin)

I am European too (despite what many of my fellow Brits want to insist) but I live in East Asia and travel frequently. I agree it's a tool and, as with all tools, is neutral. However, I can't help but notice a serious lack of commentary by figures from the left.

I'm specifically asking about bitcoin. Not interested in ethereum for technical reasons.

It's still a useful shorthand. By European standards the democrats are very right wing. Bernie Sanders would be pretty comfortable in the middle in most of Europe. 
I very much agree with your last point. I may massively disagree with libertarians on most things but bitcoin isn't one of them. Our reasoning may be completely different but we arrived at the same conclusion.

That was one tortured analogy
