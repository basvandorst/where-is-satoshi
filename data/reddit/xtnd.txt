If you actually do the calculations, you'll find that you're pretty wrong. This machine could mine in one year triple the number of bitcoins he'd be able to buy with $50,000. Even if the hashrate increases by that factor, you still forget that this machine will be running *after* the first year.

Nice try, ECB.

You also can't backup Bitcoins, because backup requires duplication. You can backup your private key, which is equivalent to printing a second key for the safe you store your gold in.

By selling them. Cash out into USD, then re-purchase coins at a lower price. As the price increases, more people will want to exchange the coins they have for USD. Supply will outweigh demand, and the price will drop.

Bitcoin never prided itself on privacy. It is an anonymous currency, not a private one.

One thing important to remember about BTC. A lot of people go on about how it can be infinitely divided, so its value can skyrocket. That's not entirely true. Bitcoin amounts are accurate to 8 decimal places. The lowest amount of Bitcoins anyone can have is .00000001BTC. If the price of Bitcoins goes above $1,000,000USD, then it will become impossible to represent the equivalent of $0.01USD in BTC. And so on as they gain in value.
That situation is unlikely, but it is important to remember in discussions about the end-game of the currency. Once we hit the hard cap on total number of Bitcoins, the price could jump.
Also, my biggest concern with BTC is the whole "lost wallets" thing. I cannot fathom how many BTC are just floating in the ether because someone lost their private key. As the number of BTC being mined decreases over time, the total supply of BTC in the world decreases. Even when the mining stops, we'll still be loosing BTC because people will misplace wallets.
I feel like there should be some system of currency reintroduction to deal with the issue of lost wallets, even if it means suffering from inflation. And, related, I also don't think there should be a hard cap on the total number of BTC. But that's just my opinion I suppose. 
I kind of like Milton Friedman's "idea" that the Federal Reserve could automate itself by automatically increasing the total number of US dollars in circulation by 4% every year ([here]( A cryptocurrency could solve the issue of lost wallets and currency hard caps by just saying "this year there will be x% more BTC in the world than there are today". Make the number of currency units in each mining block equal until the end of time and adjust the difficulty every week so that x% is met by the end of the year. Constant, expected inflation is healthier than the craziness that's happening right now in the BTC markets. 
But none of this could happen with BTC. Maybe the next cryptocurrency.

Right now, you can make around $0.66 per day with a 100 MH/s machine^[1]( . 
($0.66/24 hours*100MH/s) * (65000 MH/s) = $429 / day
It runs at about 650W. Depending on your electricity costs, that'll run upward of $3-$4/day additional^[2]( Taking that into consideration, at $50,000, this will be payed off in about 120 days. 
So its really not that bad of an investment. You could go out and buy 60 AMD cards for less, but can you imagine the overhead that'd come with? Maintaining 20-30 full computers, cooling them... power draw would be thirty times what this runs... 
Plus, there are only a few hundred machines on the market capable of running this fast. BFL is... well, you know. Avalon is only making 3 batches of these units. If you managed to get an order for one of these babies at 75 bitcoins, then you're sitting pretty right now. But otherwise, $50k upfront is still a good investment.

All of what you've said are conclusions also drawn if he legitimately cared about and believed what he's saying. I hope you understand that is why we don't use ad hominem in arguments. Don't target the person, because its impossible to conclude someone's true motives through anything but their actions. You aren't allowed to call someone crazy, but you can look at their actions and words and call those crazy. Refute what they say.

No reason for me to; its a pretty damn easy to understand topic that's been said many times before.

You know, why don't more ASIC manufacturers make boards that fit in 3.5" or 5.25" drive bays? Maybe that kind of commodity isn't a priority right now, but I feel like there'd be a real market for them. They could even cut back on the on-board cooling a bit, since it'll be in a machine which has cooling already.

Absolutely. Who is richer: The people who buy jewelry, or the people who own DeBeers? 
This guy can buy 400 BTC. Or, he can buy a machine which will mine him 1000 BTC this year alone. He can turn this thing on: in 4 months, it will have paid for itself. By December, he will have that 400 BTC he could have bought a year ago, and more. Can you honestly tell me a logical argument for the former? 
Moreover, look at the rate of return for each investment. 400 BTC will offer a rate of return solely equivelent to the Bitcoin market conditions. If he buys them at the wrong time, he could lose thousands of dollars. If he holds onto them long enough, he could make millions. Who knows? That kind of volatility is not good investing.
But a machine is different. The rate of return on a machine like this is certainly related to the value of bitcoins, but it is also tied to the rate at which it generates bitcoins. As long as both those statistics remain above a certain level, the cost of operation, this thing is making him a profit. That means an almost guaranteed positive percent return. The exact return will fluctuate, and decrease over time, but it is near-guaranteed to be positive for the next few decades. The same is not true for bitcoins by themselves.

Anyone who guesses at what the hashrate of the network will be weeks from now is... guessing. But there seems to be this notion that it will "explode" in the coming weeks because... is BFL finally shipping? I doubt it.
It will gradually increase, just as it always has. There won't be any big explosion just because someone turned on their 65 GH/s miner. We've been adding more than that much capacity to the network every few weeks for quite a while. 
But I don't think you understand the core of the issue. Here's as simple as I can make it. If he invests in Bitcoin, his investment will gain and lose value with the cost of bitcoin. Not good. If he invests in the ability to make bitcoin, once he's paid off the cost of hardware his investment will only gain value (assuming he's beating the $3/day cost of electricity, which is easy). 
Its the difference between "gaining and loosing value until the end of time" and "only gaining value after paying off the initial cost". 
So the challenge is to pay off that initial cost. And again, that's very easy. 1000 BTC in a year is very liberal, but 400 within 6 months is very attainable. Once that's paid off, he's making pure profit. Even if BTC crashes in 6 months; maybe it'll take him longer to pay it off, but once he does he's still making profit. If his coins crash, you just have to pray that they eventually regain their value, which *isn't smart investing*.

Non-experts handing out financial advice is just about as smart as non-experts inventing currencies. 
Oh wait.

But that would require about a hundred video cards. The overhead involved in installing those in, what, fifty computers might make a single machine worth the investment. Cooling is a big factor that non-miners tend to forget is an issue; these cards generate a tremendous amount of heat, and having 100 of them crunching in one room would require special consideration to the air circulation and conditioning systems.

Wildly different, in the wrong direction.
