If you have a significant amount explore a hardware wallet. If they are on the exchange you dont own your private keys, so yoy dont own the bitcoin. Exchanges have lost/stolen bitcoin in the past. Hardware wallet is the most secure solution.

Actually they aren't box plots, they're called candle charts. If you look at some of the candles bodies that don't have any wicks you can easily convince yourself that  it couldn't be a box plot. The candle body represents the price change from the open to the close of the period (red indicated a price drop and green indicates a price sell). The candle wicks represent the total range of the market value in the time period.
