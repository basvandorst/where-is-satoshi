Okay thanks :)


Yeah ok, what's the approximate price for that ? 100$ ?


Oh yeah I see.. So I need more of these things to make decent setup.


If you don't mind losing money on an experiment which may be fun then yes.
If you need to make money this way, then no.
Maybe at school I think haha.


Also try :)
Yeah just 5$ is enougth for what I'm making haha thank you very much :)
