Is there any explanation for why the market rate is climbing so quickly? Did I miss some major news?
The price had been stagnant for so long, and now its up about 50% of where it sat for all of April and most of May in just the last few days alone.

I just deleted the same exact email before getting on Reddit just now and have never done anything on Mt. Gox, so it has to be somewhere else (potentially in addition to Gox).

Can you link to that? I'd be interested in seeing how I ended up getting this email too.

I like this app as well but I wish it would not deactivate alarms each time they are triggered. Still, I would be more than happy to pay for it if we had the ability to select exchanges other than Mt. Gox.

I wish I had the brains to. Programming is not my forte!

Damn you, I put my limit order in at 645. Didn't quite make it there. It's all your fault.

To be clear, the 0.1 BTC is a **daily** limit. Still probably faster/easier than getting approval on an exchange.

Please send mine to I believe his address is 1M72Sfpbz1BPpXFHz9m3CdqATR44Jvaydd but hopefully he can correct me if I'm wrong!

Bought some at $875 then some more at 805 and will get some more if it drops under 800. Too bad I can only get 100 mBTC per day right now. Also feeling pretty okay about it.

I'm not sure of the answer to your question and Coinbase is super slow right now. Did the BTC not come right into your account when you made payment?

It's been incredible to watch how Mr. Bowtie's attitude has changed from the first couple days as he's done more research.

It takes 30 days at a 100 mBTC daily limit before it jumps to the 10 BTC daily limit.

This is really great work. Just an FYI, in the Current Value calculations in column I, if you use $D$6 instead of D6 in the formula, then it makes dragging the formula down easy as people add to their Current Stash.
