Where in the world did you hear that? Hard forks are **supposed to be hard**. If they were easy, then bitcoin would not be nearly as resilient as it is, and would therefore not be considered a secure store of value. They are a **last resort**.

@_date: 2015-12-28 14:12:02
No! I don't know who put that idea into your head but it must have been recent because intentional hard forks have been considered a last resort since at least 2011. Hard forks can weaken the network significantly because old nodes don't get updated and competing miners could maintain a divergent chain. This would cause serious usability problems and should be avoided at all costs.

@_date: 2016-03-07 00:54:20
It's not a signaling mechanism. It's a Sybil attack. Claiming you support decentralization while centralizing the network is dishonest and underhanded. 
@_date: 2016-03-02 23:27:38


No, it's not. Blocks are full because attackers are spending the same unconfirmed coins over and over again in order to give people the impression that the sky is falling. Yes, transaction volume is increasing, but it's not nearly as bad as it looks.
I just made a transaction with a very low fee of 0.0001 just to see what would happen... It got confirmed in the next block. I would gladly pay 5x-10x more than that without hesitation for urgent transactions.
@_date: 2016-01-16 00:36:00

@_date: 2016-03-02 00:21:00
Mike Hearn and R3 have a clear motive. If they can force Bitcoin into political strife using a trivial wedge issue such as block size, then the centralized ledgers they're building for bank cartels will seem more valuable. They know private blockchains are a tough sell when they're constantly being outshined by Bitcoin. It's like Microsoft trying to kill Unix so they can sell more copies of Windows.

With Segwit the signatures are still IN the block. The block isn't valid without the transaction signatures. It's just that they are now segregated from each transaction and stored in their own merkle tree, making it harder to maleate transactions and easier to prune signatures after you verified them.

I don't claim to know either, but since they often say how transparent and uncensored everything is, what do they have to hide? Why should it matter if the person is pro-Core? I realize there's a lot of fanatics over there, but a pro-Core person like nullc would lend them some much needed credibility. It's insulting to claim that nullc would vandalize a shithole like r/btc. Every other day we're hearing somebody got banned or censored, and they just keep covering it up and act like nothing happened. Corruption stinks.
