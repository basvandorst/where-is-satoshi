Is there someone deliberately going through bitcoin threads marking them down as some sort of hate crime?  I cannot see any reason this has negative karma.
Just so you know, there is a problem over at blockchain.info and they are deleting threads on their support forum.

According to whois.  And I have to say, I applaud people for putting data in their whois record. (To many people seem to want to take you coin anonimously these days).
This issue I see you running up against is that every man and his dog wakes up these days and thinks "I should run a bitcoin XXXXXX company"  (Fill in the XXXXX's with insurance, exchange, arbitrage, security's, whatever you like).
The problem is that it is becoming increasingly apparent that these people should have just stayed in bed, not that they were trying to deliberately defraud, just that they were woefully ill prepared to enter an industry that they know just enough about to be dangerous.

What kind of insurance are you offering (Liability insurance, Legal expenses insurance, Alien abduction insurance)?  And who is your upstream provider?
Also, you mention 'we' alot, is it 'we' or I?
