This bin laden has nothing to do with osama except they are from the same family, and their company always has the privilege to do multibillions infrastructure projects. Most of them billionaires, and princes. Bin Salaman the crown prince wants their money, companies, and silence who is against him becoming the king.

The Venezuelan government, not allowing their citizens to buy Bitcoin, yet they are buying it online by gift-cards.
The same in my country the banks are not allowing the credit cards to make purchase on any site that sell Bitcoin, but I found my way to buy, and trade.

I knew this moron very well. His father ripped of the budget of the Saudi Ministry of Finance in the 60's when he was its minster, then he flee out of SA with billions of dollars. A few years later he came back to SA, and nothing done to him because he is one of the royal family, and they can steal what ever they want. And this moron thinks he is a genius because he is billionaire from his father's stolen wealth.
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:06:51
This is one of the governments, and Banks attacks on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-14 07:23:42
They will freeze your account if you do it again, open new account in another Bank, and withdraw all your money from the previous bank, then close your account. If they asked why say the reason to them.

Who ever you are Satoshi Nakamoto, if you are alive ,and reading this, I adore you &lt;3
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:38:13
That's mean Satoshi Nakamoto alive, then people will get excited, and buy more. As far as I know Satoshi Nakamoto already destroyed the keys of his wallets.

I wish I have learned English before 2010, so I could have access to much more information instead of 2% of garbage content.

when I started learning about the deep web, but I couldn't buy some.
@_date: 2017-10-14 06:46:05
It will be great to me, because the dictatorship that is in my country is against Bitcoin, and I can't cash out Bitcoin, they might freeze my accounts and stop my financial life. And farther more taking my money.
@_date: 2017-10-30 08:38:36
Another new reason to me to buy crypros.
@_date: 2017-10-21 07:56:30
These *uckers are just dolls in the hand of governments, and financial institutions, they are not acting by themselves. Everyone knows governments ,and  financial institutions won't just watching Bitcoin taking the power from them slowly, and this is their time to steal or damage Bitcoin.
