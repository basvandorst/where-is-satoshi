The average religious cult is less delusional than the people in this sub.

Completely relevant everyone! Because the edited title says so! Completely relevant! Not a little bit, no COMPLETELY FUCKING RELEVANT.
I can't remember seeing something this relevant in a long time!

This was nothing but a pump and dump by whales built on the delusional euphoria from Bitcoin cultists.   
I tried to explain it to them a few days ago but was downvoted to oblivion. No such thing they said. This was user adoption and we would go to the moon. 
Again downvoted of course. Reality is hitting hard.

Ah how cute. The same cultists are downvoting me again. They absolutely hate reality being pushed in their face like this. So what's the best solution? Downvote it so it will go away and then back to Bitcoin fantasy land.

Non reversible transactions is one of the reasons why Bitcoin is so amazing is what everything keeps telling me. 
So now we want a solution for that? So it isn't really an awesome feature of Bitcoin? It was just bullshit?
