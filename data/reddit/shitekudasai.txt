My dog said he thinks the price will be 150 000 and I don't even have a dog.
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:10:45
I'm just warning people. A lot of people these days jump into crypto because of FOMO so guys like Tai Lopez see that and try to make money out of it. I don't care about people making money out of something but don't spread false information.
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:58:55
Someone you should stay far away from.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:46:33
You need to spread the risk, there are more great coins but I also do believe that when bitcoin crashes all other coins crash too.
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:12:25
You should add a message somewhere that says: "Only invest money you can afford to lose". 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:31:09
Same here!
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:11:12
He is not your pal, friend
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:38:23
And you sound like a complete retard from Retardistan. Get a life dude.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:18:18
It really isn't that hard to be one of the top countries in Africa.
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:51:27
You should be happy that you have a verified account and you own some btc. We'll get there!!
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:28:53
Damn that sucks, feel sorry for you but it is kind of their own fault for not doing their own research.
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:21:45
Don't be so butthurt. For a north african country it isn't hard to be a top african country. That is my point. 
And I'm not even american so go somewhere else with your "umercan" hate and stop acting like a child.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:52:19
Then you forgot number 1 rule of crpyto: only invest money you can afford to lose 
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:06:28
I can confirm
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:19:42
Haha I was waiting for your comment. I am making people aware of what is happening. And I am on my mobile phone so it would take me 15min to typ it in my own words.
I don't want people losing their money over a stupid game ver is playing
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:44:05
Why is everyone so hyped about litecoin? I also follow litecoin a bit but lately I see so many comments about litecoin.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:06:22
No I'm asking what the reason is behind LTC hitting 150
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:01:22
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:12:34
Yeah sure...
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:38:17
Haha this guy is gonna earn some money
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:22:11
People don't get my joke. I mean that a lot of sales start at 25%, after a week it is even 30-40% and at the end of the sales there is still stuff lying around at 75-90%.
You are longer in the game. Have you ever witnessed something like this? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:57:28
And coca cola was supposed to be a medicine...
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:47:22
But can he hodl?
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:43:28
Go to 16:40 where he tries to explain IOTA, you will have a good laugh
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:42:20
It took me long to find this. It is a bit too obvious that bitcoin, ethereum and other coins are dropping and bitcoin cash is going up like crazy. Same happened a month ago after the fork.
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:29:04
Haha are you retarded, read my previous comment again. Maybe you'll get it the second time.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:25:26
Hodl for at least a year
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:59:34
They bought back in to bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:16:10
Because crypto is still very young and there are always people who buy back in cause they see oppurtinities. So when the price starts to rise again, more people will take a gamble.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:43:26
Everybody knows crypto is a risky investment. It's very volatile, it can go down by 50% and go back up by 50% in 1 day.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:32:26
Tell me when was the last time you actually bought something with bitcoin?
And you are getting the tai Lopez ad too hahaha. That guy is a fucking joke.
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:21:24
Wow that is a dick move
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:17:26
I agree, why do people not get that BCH isn't used and when it gets used as much as BTC it will probably face the same issues.
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:36:32
I told you 2 comments ago that I am NOT from America. You've just proven that you are really that stupid as your comments.
Get some help...
And buy some glasses too...
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:27:36
If it hits 1m I'll give you 100 dollar
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:10:39
Very good idea and the site also looks very cool!
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:53:27
Will kim jong un panic sell? I heard he has a lot
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:47:01
Yes bitcoin is not an investment but 99% of the people treat it as an investment.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:00:44
With shapeshift you can convert your coins without going to an exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:23:52
You can buy houses in Detroit but you will still lose money over the time. The population in Detroit keeps declining. So more houses are for sell. That is a really bad investment.
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:11:31
Haha whatever dude...
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:46:00
So after monday there will be a huge dump?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:11:33
So the main reason you have it is for holding. Just wait for the LN. Bitcoin is getting better over time. It is still in it's early stages and is currently being flooded by mainstream media and other stuff.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:00:05
The first thing you should do is: choose a wallet. Safety is the most important thing! 
It will depend on how much money you want to invest, if you are investing a lot of money you should consider buying a hardware wallet. It isn't that expensive and you are sure that your coins are safe. You also have access to your private key.
If you want to keep the coins on your pc (software wallet), make sure your pc is safe.
A lot of people keep their coins on exchanges, it is a possibility but you don't have your private keys and have to set up a good security on the site.
So choose a wallet and look up info about that wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:00:39
Will be 75 by the end of the week ;) haha
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:42:54
Typical FOMO, I heard about it in 2013 or 2014 from a friend but never looked it up. I only started to follow it since this year so same goes for a lot of us.
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:54:26
If you want information about bitcoin than don't read here. It is full with memes and half of the people don't even know what bitcoin is.
If you really want some info use google. You will get a real insight in what bitcoin is.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:53:18
Because only a few coins can be directly bought with USD so most of the time you have to first buy bitcoin or ethereum to buy other coins. This the main reason.
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:56:46
I don't get why your comment gets downvoted. Is this subreddit really getting that toxic? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:52:52
Silk Road right?
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:44:23
Cool, I didn't know you could actually use them, I just thought it looked cool.
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:31:01
If she didn't buy him coffee, she probably already owned bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:55:00
Just use shapeshift my friend
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:08:02
The entire market is crashing now but we'll get back up
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:43:42
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:35:59
The language is dutch but I think the graph is clear
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:07:02
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:57:35
True, it gets up so fast.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:45:33
I hope this video saves a few people from panic selling.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:42:21
I buy at a small website and I can confirm that my exchange was also down.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:59:11
Really? :p 
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:46:51
I agree, you should buy a fraction and also buy some other coins. BTC is the most popular but there are a lot of other good coins with potential. Don't place your bet on 1 horse.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:02:06
But why at 11 000? And not on 10 000? Or did people just read about it now and started to sell their btc?
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:02:57
Where do you check the price? The site I am using is very inacurate the past days.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:42:13
I think this is the first crash for a lot of people on this subreddit. It's also my first crash. So I'm gonna hodl the fuck out of it.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:40:31
I think most people bought in a few weeks ago during of just before the hype. Just like me. We never witnessed a crash.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:00:13
Good post, I pointer this out a month ago but didnt get a lot of upvotes. It is good to see that this post gets a lot of upvotes. His content is full of bullshit and crap you can find by a simple google search.
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:37:35
Golden rule: buy when nobody buys, don't buy when everyone is buying.
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:08:10
They will be back soon, buying at 10K
