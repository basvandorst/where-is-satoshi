None of us should be surprised by this move. Hopefully the coin will crash and burn and that will be the end of it.

Oh well, Bitcoin ETF is inevitable. It's a question of "when", not "if".

Too little too late.

Think the time for this was really 2-3 years ago, but opportunities are still there of course.

Lots of people say lots of things like this, hard to get excited until we actually see the price go up. Fingers crossed though.

It looks like these new stablecoins are trying to capitalize on the industry's doubt/ distrust in Tether. Honestly I don't think they will have very much effect on the market as a whole unless one of them takes Tether's place as the dominant stablecoin.

Slow and steady wins the race.

They are trying to protect themselves from chargeback fraud. This is a common method of verification for cryptocurrency trades, though it is odd for a peer-to-peer trader to be asking for this. If you're uncomfortable doing this, simply find someone else to trade with.

Not surprised at all by this move. Probably a bit too late though, considering all the stablecoins that already exist, and the cryptocurrency space's disdain for fiat-demons like JPM.
