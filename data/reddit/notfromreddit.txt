I was thinking the same thing. Maybe some sort of geyser that's upstream from your normal geyser. It should save on electricity spend on heating your normal geyser.

Well, that is true isn't it?
@_date: 2015-06-07 22:08:20
If this is viable, it could decentralise the Bitcoin network some more.
With Bitcoin mining you won't need a fiber connection, but you also won't get directly reimbursed for the electricity you use. So its viability might largely depend on the value of the Bitcoin that you're able to mine.

It's not quite that simple. It might be difficult for her to exchange that for Pula. If everyone for instance sent Pula to Botswana, there will be too much supply and too little demand, making Bitcoin value there drop a lot. So you maybe sent her $100 worth of Bitcoin, but it might only be worth $50 for her.
It's still great, but there are limitations.
@_date: 2014-01-25 19:30:50
Banks can exist for Bitcoin. But it's not essential, like it is with fiat. It's kind of like having the option of being your own bank. With fiat, you're forced to choose between one of the banks, or keeping it under your mattress. All of which are turning out to be shitty options.
So Bitcoin is giving the banks compitition, forcing them to treat their customers right, or lose them.
@_date: 2014-02-17 21:20:28


That statement can only be said by someone who doesn't understand Bitcoin at all.

Good on you for replying. Sorry for being harsh. The reason it evoked such an emotional comment from me is because the article can cast a lot of hate on Yishan, unfairly. From a pretty fanatical Bitcoin fanbase. Which he certainly doesn't deserve.
@_date: 2014-11-15 22:11:04
It's not different to fiat in that regard. Both derive their value from the fact that people have faith in them.

It's definitely not irrelevant. It's just not the only thing that's relevant.
@_date: 2014-01-26 08:48:57
That's fine. The barrier to entry to being a bank is so low with Bittcoin, that there will be plenty of good options to choose from for technically challenged people.

Haha, I bet this is because of subreddits like @_date: 2014-07-26 22:20:16


Linux is to software what Bitcoin is to money. Kind of a for the people by the people thing. They're both solutions to centralised control.

Although I usually stop reading when someone says it doesn't have any intrinsic value, he's right that it can be recreated. So the cap on the number of Bitcoins doesn't make it more valuable, because other coins get created, like Litecoin.

I dot think anyone is saying that anyone who things Charlie did something wrong has a double standard.

It's all still absolutely about having faith in it. Actually, Bitcoin's price is in direct relation to how much faith people have in it.
@_date: 2014-01-17 21:55:05
It becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. People think it's going to make the price drop, so people short, which causes price to drop.

I mean, don't invest by buying Bitcoin, invest in buying stocks in Bitcoin related companies.
It doesn't matter what the alts' market cap is now. Just the fact that it's possible to create currencies that run in parallel with Bitcoin keeps its value in check. It can't skyrocket. If it becomes too expensive, people will just start using an alt instead.

Bullshit. It's very comparable. The two can be traded for each other. It's all about the mount that you're getting. I was getting less than $10. That makes it not worth the effort.

I won't call it a threat, but Bitcoin value would be many orders of magnitude more if there were no alts. So alts do bring down, or keep its value in check.
So in that case he is right to not invest in it. It doesn't make sense for Bitcoin's value to keep rising. To be honest, I think it's overvalued now. Cryptocurrencies are very useful, but just owning some will not make a good investment. I made some money off Bitcoin, but I was lucky to ride a wave. As far as I can tell at the moment, it has no real investment value.
If you want to invest, invest in Bitcoin or crypto related companies.

He means each Bitcoin address owns a part of Bitcoin.
You're all arguing semantics. The difference between 'owning' bitcoin, and 'owning' cash or property, is that the latter is enforced by law, and the former by cryptography. Practically, cryptography is a lot more solid than the law of men.

Kinda laymant here - can someone explain to me how you'd avoid spending coloured coins? So say you have a few satoshis that you want to represent shares in your company, how would you tell your wallet not to spend them with the rest of your satoshis? Can you move specific satoshis to a wallet?

Well, it's safer long term. We know Pesos are going down in value, while with Bitcoin it's very likely to go up, rather than down. So as a store of value, it's very good. Much better than cars, like the other guy said they were doing.
@_date: 2014-01-13 07:49:47

It's almost like people get inoculated against it. With like small amounts of news, or small amounts of bad news, it enters their consciousness, but they don't really take notice of it. So they know about it. If they hear about it again, they just think, 'yea, I've heard about it, not interesting'. If someone hears overwhelmingly positive news about it the first time they hear about Bitcoin, then they becoming like us -- very excited about it.

The circlejerk in here is ridiculous.
What he meant by 'the algorithm that helps determine the price' is probably the algorithm that determines the supply curve. Which in turn greatly influences the value. If Bitcoin was the only currency, Bitcoin's supply curve would be the only thing determining its value.
What he's getting at is that Bitcoin doesn't handle inflation well. Whether he's right about that is up for debate. And probably will have to be proven. I don't think anyone really knows for sure whether deflationary currencies work. Assuming we're talking in terms of Bitcoin becoming the main currency in the economy. I'm not sure if it's actually meant for that.
@_date: 2016-01-31 01:51:20
Yea, I guess it depends on how badly they want to catch you. If you're just going to deface some person's site, then they might not go as far as to subpoena hosting companies in other countries. If you're going to host dark net markets, then you probably need to hide good.
I'm just asking out of curiosity. Any form of hacking would be way too risky for me. Seeing as they usually sentence people to at least not being allowed to use computers, it would ruin my career.

To be fair, most of those channels charge you for the distribution channel, really. Because that's all they are. That's what they bring to the table. The artist gets a very small amount.
And seeing as he's not using their distribution channels, he's only depriving the artist of a very small amount of money. So it's a little bad. But not that bad.

It's a step towards bypassing it. Obviously exchanges are part of the old system. It's once you can live without exchanges that you'll be bypassing it completely. In other words, when all your wealth is in Bitcoin rather than fiat, and you can buy or sell anything using Bitcoin.

Yea, I think they call it like that because it makes it seem more serious than if it was if it was just a South African startup. Their exchange was first under the domain  I know, that's where I bought my first Bitcoin. It only moved to the .co domain in 2014 some time.

No, you're comparing the wrong things. How TV prices are affected by the adoption of the technology is completely irrelevant. Yes, their prices go down because there is no limit on how many TVs are created, like there is with Bitcoin.
It's simple steps of cause and effect.
1) New technology developed that revolutionize some aspect of our lives.
2) This new technology gets widely adopted because of this fact.
3) In Bitcoin's case, this wide adoption drives the value of Bitcoins up reliably and foreseeably.

I agree with most of your points.
I'm not sure about this, but don't we need to look at Bitcoin as becoming a primary currency? Isn't its current value largely riding on speculation that that is what will happen eventually?
If not, is Bitcoin then just like investing in gold to protect your wealth from being decreased by deflation, but with some added fluidity?
What are the things that Bitcoin's value is riding on? Of course, it's because people believe it to have value, but why do people believe that? In other words, what can happen to make Bitcoin value plummet?
@_date: 2013-12-21 08:26:26

I get that the guy is a cunt for committing fraud. But at least people who didn't know can learn from this post now. You cannot buy Bitcoin with anything that has a charge back feature. People need to be aware of it. Bitcoin, in its current state isn't for laymen, not yet.

Read my comment again. I never said it's evil. I'm just saying that it will cause bitcoin not to take off. Also, It's not the average subscriber to this subreddit that makes it a problem. It's the 1% who owns 99% of the bitcoin in existence. In the bitcoin system they can act a lot like the fed does now when they're printing money.
@_date: 2013-12-18 09:43:54
I agree. I mean it's unlikely to go lower than when China got on board. Although, some of the rise before China got involved might have been riding on speculation of China getting involved, in which case China getting out might make it drop lower than before China got involved. There are obviously a lot of factors. It's really hard for me to say, but I still think It's going to start rallying end of January.

I disagree. The best we could have hoped for is for it to be a currency. When things start getting priced in Bitcoin the value will skyrocket, because it will then have more intrinsic value.

Of course, if you can spend the bitcoins you skip tax. I'm just wondering, for in case I need a lot of money (Rands) suddenly. For now I'd probably just want to cash out some profits.

@_date: 2013-04-07 22:19:14


Really now?


What the fuck are you even arguing?
Nothing is worth anything if people don't want it. That counts for air conditioners, TVs, fiat money, gold, silver etc. So yes, Bitcoin only has value because people want it. People want it, because its very fucking useful as a form of money because:
1) The supply is controlled and predictable.
2) It's very easily divisible.
3) Near impossible to counterfeit.
Among probably some other things that I can't think of now.
So it's superior to fiat money in many important ways. Based on this, we predict that it will be adopted in a similar fashion as the technologies in the graph. And the adoption of Bitcoin and the value of Bitcoins are directly related. Hence, we predict that the value of Bitcoins won't crash.

Unfortunately for you, I think everyone wants to cash out some for Christmas, which will drive the price down. On the other hand, January will be tough, because people don't ha e money left after the holidays. But then at the end of January, people get their salaries paid, and ZipZap is selling Bitcoin. I think that is when we're going to start climbing again.

I'm a bitcoin enthusiast too, and I own bitcoin. But you're not addressing his points, which I think are actually good ones.
Both gold and bitcoin cause terrible inefficiencies. Gold needs to be mined, which is expense, and then it also needs to be stored, which is also expensive. That's very inefficient, compared to centrally controlled currency. Bitcoin uses a lot of equipment and electricity. So in that aspect, it's a lot less effective at its job than a centrally controlled currency.
We bitcoin enthusiasts see Bitcoin as the lesser of two evils in this case, because we don't believe governments have our best interest at heart. Or actually, we're just trying to grab some power back. This is the simplest and most accurate description of why we're doing what we're doing. We're trying to grab power back.
I do think bitcoin's electricity usage is something might might have to be looked at.

I'm not criticizing anyone, or trying to convince anyone to spend their bitcoin. I'm just saying it like I see it.
The problem is that such a large percentage of bitcoin are just sitting there, that the owners of these bitcoin will be able to act much like the fed when printing money. They will basically just have a lot of buying power, without ever having to have to contribute to the economy. This is a problem. And in fact, I trust the fed more than the devil I don't know.
I'd love for bitcoin to become what we all want it to become, but I'm just being realistic with the way I understand this relatively complicated situation. I keeping some bitcoin too, just incase, but I'm not expecting much.

If a large percentage of early adopters cashes out, the value will drop. The value hasn't dropped, so I'd say either people aren't cashing out as much, or there are just a lot more people buying in than cashing out.

I think they think printing money makes society prosper. I'm not sure I disagree with them. And no, it's not that they think printing money creates wealth out of thin air. The idea is that steady low inflation is best for sustainable economic growth.
@_date: 2013-09-12 15:32:43
Eh, it's actually hard for me to explain why I think this.
Basically, the big hoarders, can control the value of bitcoin. The can act pretty much like the fed are acting now. So we're not escaping the fed. I think the most probable scenario here is that the fed or some entity related to it already bought such a large percentage of bitcoin, that they can basically control the value, just like they control the value of fiat currency.

I basically just simplified it. I combined the cost of electricity and the cost of mining rigs under 'mining resources'. At equilibrium, most people will use rigs with roughly the same efficiency. Less efficient rigs won't be used, because they won't be worth it.

If you're not sure whether your target market approve of buying drugs, don't sell it as something to buy drugs with.
And frankly, we need people who don't necessarily think buying drugs is a good thing to want in the bitcoin craze. Wider acceptance and adoption is better for everyone.

The difference between the FED and Bitcoin developers is that whatever Bitcoin developers do with Bitcoin, affects themselves as well, because they have a financial interest in Bitcoin keeping its value.

Yes. I want to be optimistic. But a part of me thinks they already bought out a large enough portion of the market to control it.
@_date: 2013-06-05 21:59:04
If cryptocurrencies become really widely adopted, Fiat value will drop to zero in a very short time. Everyone left with Fiat will have lost a lot of value. I'm not sure if we'll ever reach that point though. Obviously there will be huge resistance before that happens. For this to happen the cryptocurrency also needs to be able to handle global transaction rates. I think we need several times what Visa and Mastercard are doing at the moment combined.
I do think though that people are underestimating the IMF's power to manipulate Bitcoin. Can't they just buy a lot of it and then sit on it and control it that way? Please help me here if I'm wrong.

Luckily for me I assumed I was a shitty day trader before trying to play this shit. So far not day trading has done me good.

It's bad because the player with 98% of the coins completely controls the value of the currency. That player is a huge drain on the value of the currency.
In a normal economic system people put value in to get value out. I.e. people work or produce something, for which they get money, which they can then spend in the economy for their own wants and needs. If everyone does this the economy flourishes. If there are a few players who don't have to work, the rest have to work harder to produce the same amount of products and services. So the people with the pre-mined coins just take out of the economy, but never has to put anything in. The rest of the world are basically their slaves now.
This is exactly what Bitcoin's purpose was supposed to be, or what people were hoping it would be - A way to escape being 'slaves' to the banking elite.
This is also incidentally why it's bad that the FBI now controls a huge percentage of Bitcoin. This is a huge challenge for any new alt coins. How do you distribute the early coins in such a way that early adopters don't way down the system too much.
@_date: 2013-04-09 08:58:40
I think it's unlikely, because of the fact that Bitcoin is open source and there is already so much hardware supporting it. Billions of dollars of equipment is supporting Bitcoin already.
It's open source and would be able to steal any advantages rival crypto currencies come up with. No one is going to trust a closed source crypto currency.

Yea, the way I see it, you'll either pay VAT when converting from BTC to fiat, or with normal BTC transactions. With the latter, they'd have to declare BTC legal tender currency, I think. I prefer the former. I think you'd be able to pay less tax this way, once enough shops accept BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-20 19:52:25
When bought or sold for fiat. When transacting with bitcoin, not. If enough places accept bitcoin, then you could probably get away with paying less VAT.
@_date: 2013-12-17 08:33:59
Not necessarily Big Fiat. It can be anyone who wants to buy cheap Bitcoins. It could be anyone and everyone.
@_date: 2013-12-22 00:47:15
I see. With bitcoin that wouldn't be too hard, but with other bartering it might be hard to determine the cost of the bartered items.
@_date: 2013-02-15 11:07:59
Me too, please, if there is anything left!
@_date: 2013-12-12 10:13:16
The only people they'll be able to screw over are the other ones trying to game the system. They can only screw each other essentially. The net outcome will be an increase in bitcoin fiat value.
@_date: 2013-04-07 19:32:05
Bitcoin is valuable because of its functions. The fact that it won't inflate makes it useful, and therefor valuable. So does the fact that it's a quick and secure way of transacting. 
It is a technological invention, even if it's not physical.
Bitcoin's value isn't only coming from speculation.
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:29:48
It makes sense that the price would drop to where it was before China got involved.
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:43:14
Yea, I agree with you 100%. And it worries me a bit.
@_date: 2013-09-02 13:59:27
That's cool. I bought in April, haha ;)
Still holding.
@_date: 2013-04-05 08:49:43
Using blockchain.info to get started is fine. Set up your wallet and start trading.
In the meanwhile, educate yourself on how to manage your own wallet securely, so that you can later move all your Bitcoin across.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:12:48
Oh okay. That makes it a lot less ominous.
@_date: 2013-12-12 10:29:40
They can't take it lower than it currently is. How? They can only make it go up.
@_date: 2013-12-04 11:27:03


I think one or two might remain, just as an alternative to Bitcoin. But I definitely won't invest money in any now.
@_date: 2013-04-27 22:21:22
For sure. You need to know what you're doing.
@_date: 2013-12-21 08:25:03
I have no idea. Do other countries? I assumed no, because how will you calculate VAT with bartered goods?
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:27:36
It should be called like:
1 BTC = bitcoin
0.1 BTC = decibitcoin
0.01 BTC = centibitcoin
0.001 BTC = millibitcoin
0.000001 BTC = microbitcoin
I wouldn't call it just 'bit', because those are actual things that mean [something else](
@_date: 2013-02-19 16:27:27
We're still probably at a stage where Google or governments can 51% attack Bitcoin, aren't we?
@_date: 2013-10-21 17:13:18
Are you saying that's impossible? Are you saying it's highly unlikely? I think it could be. She seems very educated on the matter. I'm willing to entertain the possibility that she's right.

@_date: 2013-12-05 10:52:12
Not sure if 'method of payment' and 'currency' is the dame thing, but as far as I can tell the biggest part of bitcoin's value depends on its potential use as method of payment. So that's something to keep in mind.
@_date: 2013-04-19 11:03:01
Twist: Assange is Satoshi Nakmoto. 
It sounds right up his alley, actually.
@_date: 2013-04-29 19:49:46
I think it's basically like bitcoin tipping on reddit, just in real life.
@_date: 2013-12-17 08:35:27
I'm pretty sure news on reddit has a significant influence on the price.
@_date: 2013-04-16 08:24:18
Someone should make a topic about it so we can discuss solutions...
@_date: 2013-04-27 20:04:10
I disagree on two things.
1) I don't see how another cryptocurrency will overtake bitcoin. There is just too much already invested in bitcoin. It's more likely that bitcoin will evolve.
2) ASICs will take over, yes, but it will be very unprofitable to switch your ASICs off to crash bitcoin. Someone else will just take over your role and rake in the rewards. You will lose bitcoin and nothing is going to happen to the bitcoin system as a whole.
Edit: What I do worry about slightly is, if it will be worth it for people to keep a enough resources on mining so that the system can't be exploited. There is an equilibrium between the amount of resources applied to mining and the return on investment for resources applied to mining.
I made this graph in paint quick: [
I probably made some logic mistakes in there. I'm not that clever, but I think this adds some value to the conversation. If someone can come in here and just tell me what mistakes are made in the graph we can try and correct it :)
