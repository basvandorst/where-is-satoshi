Who is running the bots, the exchange themselves??
localbitcoins has too many bad stories for me to even contemplate, hodl a bit longer, just want the option to move quickly if I want to.

appreciate the response, not in Syd or Mel, and want a quick way to liquidate (read profit from fall), just investigating options, doesnt seem like I have a lot, but its great to see/hear other peoples experience.

I misspoke, what are the transaction dailys, as in what amount of BTC is transacted across the exchange each day?

What are the volumes with coinjar, they don't advertise their daily's as far as I can tell?

just re-read my response, I am not sure or even want there to be a fall, but I am all in on BTC and there MIGHT be an opportunity to profit if there is a fall, which is the reason for the post so I can liquidate quickly (if possible)
If I can't, no problem, if I can, great. If I fuckup, ok woops, still all in.

Because I am Australian. seems logical, but maybe short minded?
Happy to use an international exchange that will support an Aussie bank withdrawl, so I guess the title is misleading, if an international exchange supports AU withdrawl I would be happy with that too.

appreciate the response but Localbitcoins is not an option. Rates are WAY TOO LOW, and its too wild wild west for my liking.
