It does not and no one is using segwit right now even bitcoin core does not support segwit wallet. We need a block size of atleast 4MB until LN is ready
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:26:08
Ask coinbase and search his computer for a wallet.dat , get access to his email address and see if he used any online wallet service
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:17:24
With the current network problem I don't this will ever happen
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:17:28
Bitcoin core is the original bitcoin wallet. Every node is running on it
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:34:57
I hope this is a joke read the original bitcoin white paper !
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:50:51
You must have a transaction id or Pm me the address you sent the coins to I'll look for you
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:51:18
He wanted to buy BITCOIN not BITCOIN CASH , he got scammed by Roger Ver Judas
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:59:39
It's not gone ask help from bitcoin.com support
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:29:18
Don't open multiple account you'll get booted from coinbase platform
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:46:21
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:20:51
I think there is a way you can create a double spent transaction to fix the fee not sure how thought if you dont do nothing then the transaction will be reverse just wait
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:43:22
Yes sure in 18 months and even LN white paper says to fully scale 133MB blocks are needed. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:36:17
Yes bitcoin cash just have to fix something without segwit and they will have it
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:35:06
Why would anyone sell BCH while BCH network is working and BTC not
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:52:18
If you HODL then right now you would have not lost anything. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:42:30
I'm just stating facts I'm up for it I would even contribute way more than 10$ but why don't you show us a way how to contribute $5-10 huh.
Gdax is a trading platform not a way to donate
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:16:45
They must have been accepted it before the current network problem
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:28:18
The network is overloaded right now and I would use a custom fee to send the transaction and some wallet provider doesn't use the right fee all the time so you might get ask to overpaid 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:25:07
Send them an email and try to call them multiples time. Is your account ID verified?Try to look on google if anyone had a similar problem in the past
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:25:20
He has won a battle but not the war.
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:30:52
The transaction is probably on hold just call coinbase but you're coin are not lost don't worry
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:03:21
It's terrible Im sorry
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:46:08
What the hell is bitcoin core dev team is doing then. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:31:25
Use Quadrigacx.com
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:26:55
Wait for the next miner generation which is coming out in january - march meanwhile buy bitcoin and wait
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:52:21
in a few years? are you blind? the fee are already 20$ in a few years 1k?THINK
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:50:42
Once Bcash 8MB block is fill then high fee will happen then they will upgrade to 32MB then again. The blocksize increase will be so much that you'll need a database center to host a node and thus creating centralization. Want to takedown the network?Attack the database.
Right now everyone can run a node with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:00:52
Miners don't make profit from the fee but from the block reward
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:02:41
LN and block size increase up to 4-8MB A lot of people are mad right now if LN fails then we are increasing the blocksize for sure we'll fire up core 
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:52:47
20-30$ easily
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:01:13
Local bitcoin is a very secure website , Once the seller release the funds they are in your localbitcoin online wallet instantly. It's only when you want to withdraw it from your account that you need to pay a fee which right now could be 5-10$ If you want to buy bitcoin fast I would go through localbitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:32:54
Right because increasing the blocksize until LN is out is hard
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:57:08
We need LN fund not an advertising fund
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:32:35
It's not ready to be mainstream this need to stop look at our average fee for transaction !
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:13:43
Segwit is not adopted yet because even bitcoin core does not yet so once it does it will spread fast !
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:33:06
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:53:49
That is impossible block size is 1MB whatever you seen was not a 2MB block size
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:49:12
I don't think you can withdraw for free someone has to pay the miner fee and right now its more than 10$ per transaction I dont think GDAX is paying for that
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:14:03
bitfinex exchange is down
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:31:08
It's better than nothing you idiot now no one can use their bitcoin without spending 20-30$ 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:54:10
I don't recommend it since the fee is so high now if you don't mind the fee you can
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:59:48
When did bitcoin had a large blocksize? It always has been 1MB
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:25:58
better than a currency that cost 50$ to spend everytime
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:11:28
Welcome to the cryptocurrency market
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:38:34
Yes it is they cant just support it and release it they need to test it so people don't start loosing their money and they lose all credibility. Also they spent a lot of time creating a replay protection so people did not lose their coin on the failed B2X fork
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:56:21
Because everyone is happy about the price but no one is looking at our average transaction fee
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:41:43
Make sure to tell them 20$ average transaction cost and fee that keep going up we are fucked
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:48:40
I'm ready how do we start to increase to 2MB I would even recommend for 4MB
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:48:04
They did more for bitcoin than anyone else here
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:12:19
the unconfirmed transaction is getting lower , your turn should be soon but don't worry you wont lose your bitcoin either way
you can check it here 
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:32:44
With the current network state a 10$ transaction would cost 10$ to send.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:57:37
8MB node are perfectly safe right now even with segwit we can't have a successful scale. Even LN white paper says 100MB blocks are required to fully scale,educate yourself.
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:49:42
its crashing now bubble is bursting !
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:08:07
not possible
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:30:44
''However that commit does not reduce the blocksize limit at all. It just lowers the target size for making new blocks."
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:01:03
Look into it and PM I'm very curious 
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:26:57
There is nothing to be done , the coins were sent someone else 30min after you've received them.
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:13:01
In case of fraud transaction that's why they to do it I believe there is no way to avoid this.
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:47:10
It used to be a currency right now with the success the network is overloaded but the longterm goal is a decentralized currency that everyone can use.
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:03:43
Bubble is about to burst I don't know why but I got a feeling
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:01:09
Yup no release date just more testing. and no message from core team whatsoever. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:19:44
for a while? 1$ Fee won't get ever confirmed 
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:18:50
4-8MB blocksize should be fine.The current network fee cannot last for long , people are getting fed-up 
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:48:34
LN is not there and we are talking about opening a donation fund to help the LN team
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:48:37
Yet the obvious solution is a block increase to atleast 4MB until LN is out. 4MB won't be enough LN white paper says to fully scale it needs a 133MB blocks. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:37:20
Right now people are buying BCH for 8500$ on GDAX meanwhile bittrex BTC/BCH price is at 3500$
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:31:34
I use Quadrigacx if you confirmed the amount then its either approved or pending for manual review
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:18:54
then tell me why is BCH more profitable to mine?The average BCH fee is 0.04 
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:22:09
Yes I believe you are right but I think we will increase the blocksize to atleast 4MB , maybe 8MB once LN is out developpers will work on that 
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:39:33
He can complaint about the fee because it's a huge problem right now we both know it don't insult him for that
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:59:05
then WHY are they doing NOTHING we need something NOW
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:58:46
It would be very silly to ignore it right now our network is a very badshape and as long as the price keep going up it get worse everyday 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:28:15
Good luck
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:05:35
He's saying he took the lost and sold the BCH for BTC but if he holded the BCH he would have not lost anything right now
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:43:22
OP is the same type of guy that says 20$ average transaction fee is normal
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:40:31
We have Adam to ruin us look at us right now 20$ fee for each transaction 
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:04:51
Right now we can't spend our bitcoin until LN is out or we increase the block size, I'm waiting as well
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:59:36
Once bitcoin price stabilize everyone will sell since they cant get a 100% return on a 3 month period anymore then the bubble burst for a while then once bitcoin is ready to scale you can guest what happens.
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:12:30
Everything you receive a payment the receiving address change could be that
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:22:54
Give me a name
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:20:02
I think BTC is over until LN is out. Mempool is full and BCH as a working product right now. Only thing you can protect yourself as an investor is to hold the same amount of BTC in BCH so no matter who wins it won't matter
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:02:54
We won't keep the 1MB block forever we increase once LN is release , I think the highest we'll go is 8MB
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:34:40
It's not supported yet they are working on it
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:33:20
Even if we are in a bubble I don't see why it would crash right now. You've got to think why would it crash right now?
Could be government ban or bitcoin is getting hack 
thats why it would burst but doesn't look like anytime soon.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:55:45
Ok but even if they do not everyone has an account on GDAX ,early adopters coins are all in cold storage
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:56:29
Pm me all the address you've sent the coins too and worst case if they are stolen you can get your bitcoin cash and your bitcoin gold coins atleast you still make 1k+
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:33:19
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:43:04
That's not what happened 
see : 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:10:29
The LN whitepaper says a 133MB is needed to fully scale
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:26:39
Yes that's right in 10 year the average user could easily run 32MB then we could increase to such amount. 
Right now we need to check what's the average node can run
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:34:28
Thank you Adam
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:25:06
The big name tried to do it without the whole community they did it behind close door we must all agreed to make it work
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:51:34
Ethereum has a the double amount of transaction and less than 1$ fee per transaction
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:23:21
No proof just my gut feeling
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:46:38
Type your transaction id ( tx) into blockchain.info site 
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:57:06
Bitcoin is suppose to be for the whole word.
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:53:18
Bubble is bursting ! Another Mt gox?
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:34:52
I was like you a few weeks ago now I'm done with core
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:50:54
it does not if you want to send 5$ in transaction it will cost you 20$
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:11:10
Transaction fee will be less because more people will use the LN, but anyway if LN doesn't work I will personaly make a proposal with the whole community to increase the blocksize
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:12:44
Charlie lee already agreed on increasing the block size
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:35:14
with this current network congestion no way it will go floop
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:06:42
Scalability is a huge problem right now , Bitcoin has become too popular and it's not ready. Solution are being worked on as we speak see the LN network.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:15:06
You need to contact coinbase they have phone support now
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:14:05
yes bitcoin is becoming more popular and network is overloaded
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:31:29
That's the number of hat sold
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:37:35
LN white papers says to scale it needs BIGGER BLOCK
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:24:26
No read the last comment It wasn't the about the blocksize. The blocksize always has been 1MB
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:25:42
LN is the project they are working on check it out 
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:28:07
and core dev team think this is a normal 
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:51:05
It's been full 100k+ Since a week now We need to increase it right now how do we start?Bitcoin core team took control !
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:00:52
Does not matter because if bitcoin is illegal now people will stop using it price will go to 1$ quickly
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:52:15
Once LN is out we will increase the blocksize to how much? I don't know but not to 2MB its too small
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:38:32
He got scare like a cat and left the project 
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:42:51
He must be a billionaire now if not almost
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:46:14
This would require a hard fork which cannot be easily done it takes time there is no fast solution if we go to 8mb then go back to 1mb someone will refuse and keep using it thus splitting the network it doesn't make sense to downgrade so once LN is out then we will find a proper MB to increase then stay there 
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:01:14
that no one use even bitcoin core does not use it and even the LIGHTNING NETWORK says a block size increase is NEEDED . EDUCATE YOURSELF
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:12:18
Is this a joke
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:34:06
If you had 100$ it would have cost you 80$ thats the problem
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:58:29
Stupid logic
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:25:56
Ledger wallet is not a source.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:18:44
That is not true at all.To use LN Bitcoin Cash need a malleability fix which can be fixed easily without Segwit. It's not urgent. If LN works then it would work better on Bitcoin Cash because it has 8mb blocks and core 1MB. The LN white paper says a 133MB blocks is needed to fully scale. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:51:42
It's bitcoin core team that do not want to ! The miners all agreed to increase the size but they don't control bitcoin core...
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:13:25
LN should be ready by next summer I believe right now they are under stress to finish quickly since the network is bad right now.
The recent buyers are speculator and they aren't using bitcoin for anything so I don't think they will leave for other currency what they'll do is have 50% in BTC and 50% in altcoins
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:50:06
Satoshi wanted also to increase the block size , you're saying it's stupid?
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:31:48
Probably overloaded
