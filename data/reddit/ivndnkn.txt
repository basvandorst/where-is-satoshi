I did check history of this service. Nothing was strange. 
As i mentioned, they changed terms and conditions silently, without visible notice on service page.
@_date: 2018-12-18 21:13:23
You are welcome.
Any good word is big support for me now.
@_date: 2018-12-18 20:44:41
There also was not any fiat game involved.
@_date: 2018-12-18 20:25:44
You are locked my funds, i do not accepted your terms and conditions. You renew your terms silently, without any notice on the wallet. You can’t hold my funds without legal basis (like a court decision).
@_date: 2018-12-18 20:07:21
update: they banned my everywhere on their social networks.
@_date: 2018-12-18 18:43:52
Im forced to give my coins to them.
@_date: 2018-12-19 18:53:01
Hit my pm, if you will find the time. ty.
@_date: 2018-12-18 18:42:11
Hi guys, im sorry for being a bit offtopic, but i need your help.
Reddit is my last hope to get my coins back.
@_date: 2018-12-18 20:40:57
I did change my email adress attached to wallet and also i withdrawed my funds everyday. As much as possible.
@_date: 2018-12-18 21:43:51
I will do it.
They are very carefull about their reputation, so sharing and upvoting it to the hell also could help.
Thank you for your words.
@_date: 2018-12-19 09:10:51
Hello guys. Im asking for help, any words are appreciated.
@_date: 2018-12-18 18:38:10
@_date: 2018-12-18 21:32:45
Bank? I never know that ht is bank. It was positioning like "online wallet".
@_date: 2018-12-18 21:36:02
My friend, i regret my actions so much that i wish to commit suicide at somepoint. I would do otherwise if I knew all this before.
@_date: 2018-12-18 20:51:29
I am waiting for the refusal to return my funds to start suing them. Im clear and im not hiding.
@_date: 2018-12-18 21:28:04
Absolutely right. Also important to know: this wallet has no fiat gateway, all this "rules and regulations" was invented by them.
@_date: 2018-12-18 22:12:42
Same to you.
Upvoted your case.
Best wishes.
@_date: 2018-12-18 20:32:17
I don’t want to use your service anymore, you can suspend my account, but before suspending i request full moneyback.
@_date: 2018-12-18 20:59:05
Thank you for good words. I'm not ashamed to look stupid, just because the truth is on my side.
@_date: 2018-12-18 20:28:26
Its not fair, you had changed game's rules to your side. You almost blackmailed all my private data and i dont see any progress.
@_date: 2018-12-18 21:53:38
I cant dm you. Can you dm me?
@_date: 2018-12-19 05:23:51
Same story here
@_date: 2018-12-18 21:39:56
i'm sure they will no longer answer here... the will fuck me in zendesk directly. im already on 6th lap of KYC, i provided more then 10 variations of documents...
