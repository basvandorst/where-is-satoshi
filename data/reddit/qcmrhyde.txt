Exactly, a fixed block size is against Satoshi's vision so I highly doubt he is in the Core team.
@_date: 2017-02-09 16:45:15
I agree 100%!
@_date: 2017-02-14 20:37:53
May I ask where you come from? Because I'm from Québec, Canada, where everyone says we are the most taxed in the world (which is probably BS) and we are far from that 80%.

Wait for Tesla solar roof tiles then heat your home (if you're not in the south) mining bitcoins or alts. That's what I'll do when I'll buy real estate so it pays for itself as much as possible. ;)
@_date: 2017-02-14 21:49:19
Haha exactly, anyway being a home owner in itself is not always a great thing. If it's really important for you, I get it, but it's just some stupid idea that got engraved in people's mind and now some douches try to make a dick mesuring contest with all those social constructs.
@_date: 2017-03-02 14:36:39
Thank you for the answer. I don't want to be harsh but you should really update the checkout part of your website because a lot of people won't like that experience. You should also either use your Twitter account or delete it because it looks like your company is dead silent since 2016, another thing that freaked me out a bit on the moment.
@_date: 2017-02-14 14:59:50
I have the exact same mentality. What you did is you "bought back" your freedom and that's exactly what I'm in the process on doing. Now let's hope I beat your 42. ;)

I received an email tellling me it was an error in their plugin and that they will ship the order. I'll edit the title to say I was wrong but I think people should now this before ordering...
1- Your order will be cancelled after something like 5 mins so either double the transactions fees or don't freak out (like I did lol) about the cancelling of your order and contact Customer support... DON'T forget the 4 digit number they will give you.
2- I would recommend using Shape Shift for this one since you'll probably have to deal with both Customer support services and it will be a real shit show.
I'll post a review of the hardware when I'll get it. Thanks for your answers.
EDIT: Seems like I can't change the title but I guess people will see that post it's upvoted
@_date: 2017-03-30 15:14:39
That's what I was thinking too, let's hope it's not.
@_date: 2017-03-02 00:55:40
I will update as soon as my order is processed and they give me a tracking number. I'll hope it's just bad website programming but thanks for confirming me that you actually got one shipped to you.
@_date: 2017-03-02 00:45:29
I usually spend my bitcoins on Purse.io and they have some kind of timer like that but if you time out they don't cancel your order and keep your bitcoins, never had any problem with them and I usually pay the same fees.
@_date: 2017-03-27 20:26:42
43.1% is "near 50%" enough for me lol. Depends of your POV.
@_date: 2017-03-23 16:09:01
Agreed, nowadays people can't debate ideas because they are narrow minded morons... Just look at the politics with all that crazy libs vs Trump supporters feud that is trying to kill freedom of speech and it's exactly like Bitcoin politics.
We now live in an Idiocracy, the majority of the population feed their body with fast food and their brain with reality TV. You shouldn't waste any of your time with mouth-breathers that can only do war of opinions (my idea only) instead of having an intelligent debate (evolution of an idea).
@_date: 2017-03-17 18:25:44
It's actually as good as an analogy as "Bernie Sanders is a communist" or "Donald Trump is a nazi". That's how most people thinks nowadays.
@_date: 2017-02-14 21:15:17
I could argue a bit of the math but on principle, I'm right here with ya. I think that if you have any kind of debt, you're slave (or you'll have to be) to the person or entity that made you that loan. Too many people don't realize how much they live a lifestyle way bigger that they actually can afford and all that for materialistic BS like useless toys or some stupid "show off material".

You can piss on millennials all you want, I'm not form that generation.

Boomers say Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme, then they tell you to contribute to social security. They had their brains completely washed by the Keynesian non-sense.

Hehe thx, to actually answer the question... My (crypto) seeds are PGP encrypted on multiple USB keys and distributed amongst trusted members of my family. I might order a cryptosteel and use that too since, like many, I'm a bit paranoid with securing those.

Wow, thanks Kraken for actually caring about us (QuadrigaCX customers) and the crypto ecosystem in general. In contrariety with Gerald Cotten, his estate, his partners, the Bitcoin Co-op and all the crooks related to this BS.
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:59:32
If he does have them, he can just do his 2 years in jail, declare bankruptcy, then "clean" the bitcoins and live a long happy live with his pocket full while Ross Ulbricht is in jail for life. I highly doubt you'll ever see any kind of real justice against any type of authority.
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:00:53
I thought the only thing that wasn't clearable by bankruptcy was student loans but that's great if that's the case, at least he will be in trouble financially, that's some kind of justice I guess (still very stupid compared to Ross' sentence).

Hyperinflation is the effect not the cause, the cause is fucking up free markets for their country (and corrupt politicians, like all countries). Now, you'll instantly tell me it's because they are "socialists" without being able to realize that the US is one of the most socialist countries in the world. Your military is a public service and a public employer and you WILL suffer hyperinflation on the long term too, just like all other empires (or besieged states). That's why we both use Bitcoin even if we think differently.

I don't give a shit if "you saw it" lol, the graph doesn't show it!

Can someone explain to me why is the gold inflation line so straight?
@_date: 2016-09-28 16:07:24

On the first view this will be very confusing especially for newcomers, your logo looks like the BCash one, your name sounds like the BCash wallet but you call it a "Bitcoin Core" android wallet. You should re-brand the whole thing and cut the "Core" in "Bitcoin Core" IMHO.

You are way too reasonable to comment on that debate. It's like an holy war out here, lol... Praise the Lord Segwit and burn all those big blockers to the stake in the name of the Father, Bitcoin Core! (I think SegWit + 2MB would have solve this debate months and months ago)
@_date: 2017-05-11 16:09:12
I think even 0.1% could alomost be enough but the problem for me is not donating but finding an organization that actually really gives back the money that they fund raise. Usually it's like 80-90% back in the "infrastructures" of the organization, which is complete bullshit and should be illegal. But a good portion of what capitalism is, is fucking people over false pretence, so I guess they are doing a great job.
@_date: 2016-07-06 14:09:56
I'm probably be switching after all that BS but I'M trading BTC/CAD, if you do too go to QuadrigaCX or Kraken. If you trade BTC/USD there's a lot of options, Bitfinex seems to be a good one but I've only done a couple of trades on it just to have a look.

If you write a tune and don't get paid for it, then you're a not on a Torrent site since nobody knows who the fuck you are. If you're a well known artist that think he is a victim because of a couple torrents, then get your head out of your ass and go read about the music industry and the "360 deal" because your whole point of view is shit. THEY (the music industry) are STEALING from you, not people that are COPYING your art on the Internet which they probably do because they have a shitty job, flipping burgers.

Please people stop bashing Coinbase, they are a really ethic company. They actually are philanthropist since the vast majority of their employees have an high rate retardation. This is why they always have great ideas, are good for the bitcoin community and I really hope they don't go under.
@_date: 2016-07-27 15:02:04
They are about to kick out all canadians in a couple of days and they say if anybody leave any CAD in their account "they will be subject to high withdrawal fees". Which means, they are going to steal from people. 
I really don't know why people are still trusting these crooks. They are just not trustable and every single one of their employee should be ashamed of themselves.
@_date: 2018-12-29 17:14:29
That's called speculating / trading, not investing
@_date: 2016-07-07 15:24:35
I agree 100%, I'm canadian and they are literally asking for "my papers" (another ID) and all IDs are rejected, they want my passport (which I don't have and I would not have give them anyway). They really don't give a flying f_ck about their customers. They are parasites for the Bitcoin community and I hope they go under.
@_date: 2018-12-29 17:01:58
Well then panic sell and be one of those who lost money with Bitcoin lol
@_date: 2016-07-07 21:02:13
I'm quitting Coinbase and I actually really like QuadrigaCX but I'm going to move my trading to Kraken, unfortunatly. The reason why is 0.5% fee is way to high for trading. You should really think about lowering that rate.

`If an asset is in an obvious downtrend, it's not wise to keep holding it.`
I think you really don't see the difference between investing in an asset and trading it. You're basically telling the kid to learn TA and put stop lost limits on his (what should be) long term investment. Which might be good advice if he is the kid of Tone Vays but if he starts doing that shit right away. I would bet he will loses money for sure and at that point I don't see why you're not telling him to trade ANY assets. If you're just gonna speculate, why use Bitcoin? Why don't you tell him to use great tools like leverage so he can "invest" even more with less money? ...I'm just trying to keep it simple with basic rules but if he wants to gamble (which is what unexperienced traders are doing), go for it! But then again, why not play poker with the 100$?
@_date: 2018-12-29 01:46:22
Here's the 3 big rules of investing in Bitcoin IMO:
\ Invest only what you are ready to lose  
\ You have to read and believe in the technology, it's economic value and it's developers  
\ It's a long term investment, HODL, don't panic sell and be prepared to see the price take big plunge (that's why rule  is the most important)
@_date: 2016-07-06 13:19:37
I have to same problem and those morons doesn't answer any email, as usual. It sucks because I really like the GDAX trading UI but CoinBase just don't give a f*ck about their customer and they seem to be trying to do a corporate suicide with all their non-sense with identification and all that sh*t. I'm from Quebec and they don't even accept the "sun card" as an ID, which means they'll probably lose 99% of all the customers from my region that doesn't have a passport.

Is there any other subreddit for real information on Bitcoin anymore since both and have been completely over flown with crap?!?
@_date: 2018-12-29 17:20:30
You are right, but people that bought BTC at 10K$+ in late 2017 didn't know WTF they were doing in the first place. They were going for the hype and the FOMO. So yes, they might have lost less than they should by cutting their loses but I highly doubt that they bought back again at 4K$ and let's wait and see in a couple of years if they would have really lost money if they would have HODL.
@_date: 2018-12-29 18:25:23
I know that HODL is not a rule but it's a well know term in the community, just read it as "hang on tight" but that's probably not good neither since it's written on a fucking cat poster lol.
~~TLDR; If you "invest" in a company, sell everything as soon as you see some red on the sheet!~~  
Edit: TLDR; We are not on the same page about the word "investing" but pretty much are about the rest, at least I think
