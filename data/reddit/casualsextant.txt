I think your question is - when will it be feasible to set a fixed amount of BTC as someone's salary?
Nobody knows the answer to that. 
I'll posit that fixed hourly or annual salaries may not even make sense and should be overhauled. Maybe BTC helps move that idea along to prevent us staying with the current systems that make almost everyone worse off over time.

It does not work like that. If you contact an OTC desk and want to buy or sell, they will give you a quote based on how much they can complete the trade for, plus their fee. They can complete that a number of ways - exchanges, their float, one or more other otc traders, or a combination of all that. You can't beat the market the way you're assuming. It's already priced in.

Not sure why you're being downvoted in the daily thread, this is a good point of discussion. 
As someone that's used BTC a bunch of times as a currency to buy things, it was not at all inconvenient. So that may be a false assumption on your part. Volatility has some side effects when using it, but nothing serious. Usually your rate is fixed for a short window when buying, and that probably helps add a little stability since behind the scenes there is some hedging and risk management happening to support commerce.

You make some interesting assumptions. 
1 - That you're being spied on by a lawful democracy, that has some kind of majority approval. That is a dangerous assumption. On the internet anyone could be spying on you, including governments that routinely murder or imprison people they don't like. You don't have any influence over those if you can't vote there, or if they are not a democracy. 
2 - That the majority is right. What if you don't agree with the majority? They may approve of your loss of rights for many reasons, including your religion, skin color, sexual orientation, or remarks made in a discussion forum. That doesn't make them more right than you. 
3 - That anyone spying on you is technologically superior to you. Why do you think that is true? Does doing nothing somehow improve your situation? I don't think so.  We must act with the information we have, and not be defeated by assumptions of all-powerful secret enemies.

Not in the world of Bitcoin, no. When large trades do happen, they are usually through block trades that are done off the exchanges. The brokers that facilitate those large trades then go to the exchanges and other brokers to settle the trade. A trade at that size wouldn't happen this fast - to save $20m they would have spread it out. 
Having said that, anything is possible. but there's no clear evidence that anything like a $100m trade happened. Don't believe it just because one person said it happened.
@_date: 2019-04-24 19:27:31
This is a misconception I have seen repeated over the years. It is based on naive assumptions about mining as a business. Let's clear some of it up.
Mining businesses don't operate hand to mouth. Like other businesses, they have funding, and business plans, and longer term goals. They don't sell mined coins immediately. Some of these operations have never sold in years because the tens of millions invested will sustain them through any bear market.
Stop assuming miners are selling all their coins.

Market cap is currently around 152 billion USD. If you could buy 25% without moving the price it would cost 38 Billion USD. We can discount this rumour as absurd. 1 - the price would move significantly with that much buying pressure. 2 - No individual would bother, even if they had that amount spare for a single investment class. 3 - No single fund or institution would take on that kind of risk.
Conclusion - rumor is false.

Depends. Their reputation for security and being generally safe to use - yes. Their reputation as a good community member has evolved over time from great to so-so. They don't adhere to the values they wrote up because they're just words - not actual values or missions. Business is business though, and they are able to scale quickly without failing too badly and make tons of money for their investors. 
Would I keep Bitcoin there? Yes. Would I let them meet my mom, fuck no. They're clearly lecherous people popped straight out of a privileged mold. Their idea of an open financial system is one where it's the same as using a bank for rich people. I wonder where that idea came from in a company run by privileged bay area tech millionaires.

Bitcoin security is complex enough to make an ETF or custodial platform, like the upcoming Fidelity one, a safer bet for institutional traders. This way they don't have to worry about security / storage. 
Some products make this easier, like hardware wallets and Casa multi-sig managed storage. But having zero direct interaction removes a huge risk.

There's no informed judgement here, because there's no way to validate what happened unless you work at Coinbase. Having said that, it's clear from years of anecdotes in the community that Coinbase has anti-fraud automation that rests on a hair trigger. My guess is an insta-ban triggered in their system - whether through a third-party service checking credit / fraud scores or through their own checks. A blacklist would be possible too, but smells like tinfoil-hat-level fear mongering.
