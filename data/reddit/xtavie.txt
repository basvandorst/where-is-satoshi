first website I try to use doesn't have any mention of bitcoin at all, anywhere on the site...

Hopefully we see a large influx of people in coins after Christmas, which I see as a good possibility with a lot of people sharing your mindset.

I'm glad to help in any way I can, I love projects like this. After all, this is what BTC is truly meant for.

That's the company's goal. Granted, it is new and experiencing some growing pains it definitely is not a platform that disappoints.

A major problem in the BTC space is people are viewing btc as a product, or solely even as a investment vehicle (most of the people that got burned on more money than they could afford in the recent crash). 
I propose a view, instead, of using bitcoin as a method of not only making money in the form of direct returns, but also also as a method of allowing the transfer of capital to places it otherwise cannot go. Essentially, allowing both parties to benefit.

I believe this is more of a move on blockchain's part into the mobile space, they have the desktop game covered.

Hopefully we're the ones doing the flipping.

not many can followup with 100k BTC however.

I have a friend in Kenya who uses a SMS based method of BTC transactions. I'm not aware of the full details, but I'll reach out to him and see if it's adaptable (or even completely portable) to a Zimbabwe market.

ZeroBlock by far is the best btc app I have personally used (nonwallet). It has everything from altcoin news to EUR/BTC prices on BTC-E.

Bitcoin is meant to be used as a currency. It has grown to be used for much more of course, but that doesn't change what it's technically meant for.

alright, thank you very much!
@_date: 2013-12-11 03:49:39
it's not about the money, it's about the idea geez
@_date: 2013-12-02 04:48:01
Why thank you
@_date: 2013-12-24 00:20:18
Just as insightful as this one.
