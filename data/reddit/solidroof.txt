Bought 2 coins off a bloke in the street in the UK I met through localbitcoins about 4 years ago. Mined 0.1 coins. Bought 2 more coins. Total cost about £400. Watched them go to $1000 then crash to $120. Was annoyed I didn't sell. Since they hit $8000  I've been selling them for store vouchers. Have about £7000 worth. Got about £17k in bitcoin left. First heard about bitcoin when it crashed from $80 to $2. Wish I'd bought then! Still, a 5000% return on investment is pretty good.

Given they've had a power-cut in the country for 8 days or so... imagine that
No financial institutions working. No money. No fridges. No refrigerated food or medicine, no frozen food. 
1-2 days in a Western country and we're back to cave-men days - we in the West would be up sh\*\*\* creek without a paddle. The World has been warned. All food distribution, hell - "all" distribution is now electronic based.

I get 28kWh from my 4kW (28/4 = 7, although there's 12hrs of sun in a summers day - for the first 1.5 and last 1.5 the sun would be too low to be producing at a fraction of peak) system on a roof mount. If I had a motorised mount I might get 35kWh. But a roof is higher so less shading issues and longer unshaded sun - so a roof is usually the best place for most people unless you have open land and no trees for 50m. As long as the roof is roughly south facing you're fine. Even if the sun is at 45degrees to the side you'll still get 75%+ power.  This is why even giant solar farms don't bother with motorising their panels. So just stick them on a south facing roof, or split them across an East / West facing roof.

I'd sell 5-10% a month so as to have something else out of it than your initial holding.  That's what i've been doing.

Is there a news article about this?  Really, 100s of millions?
I bet the person who bought pizza with 20,000 bitcoins in the first transaction is kicking himself for buying that pizza now... especially if he didn't keep a hold of even 1% that amount.
There was a story in the UK press about a bloke who threw away an old HDD that had about 1500 bitcoins on it that he'd mined as a student, he'd then forgot about it for years - was worth £5-10m at the time of the article. The local tip wouldn't let him dig it up to find the HDD (which might be dead / crushed in the collection anyway)!

my story. I mined like 0.15 coins. Gave it up as it was personally a waste of my time and too slow, and the price was rising. So used a website to meet a bloke in a dodgy part of town. He normally traded gold coins but had got into bitcoins - told me to download an app for my phone. If I gave him cash ($350) he'd copy 2 onto my phone. I didn't get mugged. It was legit. I went back and bought 2 more off him for circa $450 a few weeks later. Luckily copied all but 0.1 off my phone onto my home PC as I then had my phone stolen!  The price went to $1000. I didn't sell and kicked myself. It fell to about $150 and I kicked myself some more. 2 years later it was $19000. I found it was very hard to sell bitcoins for fiat. Some machines wanted 8% commission and all forms of ID and bank details.  But I found a website where you could sell bitcoins for giftcards and have, over the last 18 months converted, in about 20 transactions, $5000 into supermarket vouchers and $5000 into amazon vouchers (this is around the capital gains allowance in my country so I didn't have to pay much tax). Like an idiot I sold nothing really between Jan2018 and Aug2018 as it fell to $5000. So I'm up 2000%, have 1.6 coins left but still wish I'd sold at the peak for $80,000.
