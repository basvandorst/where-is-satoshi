it's proof enough that someone openly wanting to claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto with such desperation... that he is simply too DUMB to be him :)  
It's just my idle speculation, but... if you actually had that many bitcoin, getting your identity revealed would probably get any low-level criminal from organized crime with even HALF a brain from all over the US(or xyz country) jumping on trains and airplanes just to kidnap and torture you for that much money...*  
   
*Didn't watch the video tho, I've already heard enough about this clown, lol*  
  
*also another reason why I hate the hare-brained stupidity of the media, in general (but also with the doxing scandals over the last years)

yeah, and thanks to the ratings system and invention of SR type markets that Ross Ulbricht started, people can now buy safer and with less risk of bad side-ingredients than they will ever be on any shady street deal!

it most definitely is new money :)
however technology is just a tool, and tools don't fundamentally change the nature of whoever uses it...
i.e. we're still "just monkeys with car keys"

well, China also bans re-incarnation without prior approval...
I think this deal with the PBOC is just the whole central bankster mafia trying to attack BTC at a perceived weak point by wanting to cripple the large demand in China.
I'd also add that freedom is in direct opposition to governments everywhere, which owns nothing yet wants to control it all. This sick need for control of everything is especially going to take form in these strong knee-jerk reactions that we're seeing in China especially. No surprises
