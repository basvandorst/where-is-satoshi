Goldmoney dot com fixes all the issue for gold, i have a debit card on me that i can use to trade any amount of my gold with anyone in the world. You can even store cryptocurrency and spend it with your debit card. I dont work for them, i am just a client.

ye, but for the average user like me, doesnt that mean that the government can still spy on me, like they probly can find a way to know what IP address uses bitcoin and then maybe like send the IRS after me and shit dont you think? I am a nub here, so please let me know, I want to know if its possible or if I am crazy.

I was hoping someone would tell me, but I dont know, if they can spy on all your Internet traffic and all, cant bitcoin also be affected by this?

Narco-terrorism? LOL, thats a thing now? These people sounds so dumb, when I hear things like this I hear in my head, what if he said alcohol-terrorism? I think if he did that, most people would laugh so hard and I hope in a near future the mass is going to react the same way toward dumbass that say stupid thing like narco-terrorism.
