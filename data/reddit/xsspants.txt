Tulipmania... no. That lasted, what, months? a couple years at most? On something with no utility? You're parroting a bankster thinktank talking point there.
Bitcoin has been around for something like a decade, and has generally only gone up year over year. It has strong utility in bypassing restrictive banking cartels in instances like Greece, or other such cases, or as a store of value in an easy to access asset to hedge against inflationary currencies and collapsing economies. Nevermind the sheer value of moving large sums across borders without engaging with banks much...

It's not absurd value today. It's not even at 1 mil yet. Todays value is a vast discount.
Lets play some math.
There can only ever be 21 mil btc. there's only about 4 mil left to mine...
So *worst case*, if every btc were circulating. (closer to a quarter or half in the end... ideally)
BTC as a whole at 1mil a coin is 21 trillion. So lets write off lost coin and round that down to a 10 trillion market cap to reach 1 mil/btc. The global GDP is 75..ish..trillion.
You only need a scant 13% of the world market. Wall st and china alone are starting to bring btc to those kind of numbers, but it will take time and a lot of luck.
Like i've said.
Invest 1000 today and *sit on it*. You can afford to lose 1000 dollars on a bet like this, and the pay off is enormous if it goes well. :)

I don't think you catch the implication.
Banks exist as a central pillar of power. Meaning they have, pretty much every single country in their pockets. Meaning they can control the legislature on mere whims (and have before).
They decide BTC has to die? I'm sorry, but BTC will *fucking die* at that whim. and there's nothing you, nor I, nor any small militia formed here, can do about that. The paramilitary police forces world wide will protect the establishment and shed *our* blood over this if you fight it. Nobody on the other side of that line will even shed a fucking tear about it.

Well, "total loss" is covered by the recovery passphrase.
My concern is less keyloggers and more "access device, download app container, crack offline". (which goes back to not knowing iOS that well, maybe the app containers are more encrypted than I think they are.). The phones are supposed to be encrypted but you can boot them all the way to the PIN entry without needing to decrypt anything with a key.

i'm not terribly 'up' on iOS security but, as a user, it seems like the entire app is behind that 4 digit pin, meaning that 4 digit pin is the crypto to the app container aka wallet?
That does not give me a lot of confidence in wallet security. (assuming the iOS side of security has been bypassed and the attacker has access to the storage and app)
(as opposed to my desktop and blockchain.info wallets that each are behind 8 word pass phrases with symbols and numbers. covering AES on one and whatever blockchain uses for the other)

You don't have all the facts. Your judgement is irrelevant to any discussion. As would mine be if I bothered to say what my opinion on the case was.

For society to move completely or even partially cashless, you need businesses that refuse to accept cash, banks that refuse to provide it, and laws against it.
Thus far, none of these conditions are present, much less in progress (outside of some conspiracy tin foil-hattyness).
The only 'cashlessness' currently is just simple free market incentive of convenience to use Debit and not needing to carry cash. But that's a choice and not forced on anybody, as probably every merchant in the world accepts their local fiat cash.
I'll worry when employers start en masse forcing direct deposit and merchants force no-cash policies. But there's not even a movement or broad desire for this, so worrying about it is FUD.

I work in IT and make a decent sum.
it's taken me 5 years to even save up a portion of a down payment for a house in current markets unless i want a shithole.
After i commit to that, it'll take 15-30 years to even pay that off, a time during which i am a complete slave to the wage unless i want the forced homelessness and starvation and ultimate painful death that not working brings.
After that payoff, i'll be decently well off, but too old and it won't matter.

Basic economics. Demand goes up with the wealthy, and HODLrs sell to said wealthy at said demanded prices.
It's not really a transfer of wealth since the dollar would be crashed or hyperinflated, but you'd technically have millions of dollars from a few btc.
If you continue to hold, your buying power is increased not because any wealth transferred to you, but because you rose with the tide in a new global economy, relativistic to an old crashed economy. and one BTC is an enormous slice of a global or even US only pie.

In 20 years of using Windows, i've never gotten malware. And i don't even run an anti-virus.
Just practice safe computing...
Windows, by nature of being under siege for decades, is more hardened out of the box than linux is. (Linux, you have to manually set up the firewall, as its disabled by default, and manually enable process security, SElinux, fail2ban, LOTS of sysctl.conf tweaking to block things like syn attacks, ignore icmp, etc.
Don't get me wrong. I wouldn't use anything else BUT linux for my servers, but that's with 24/7 multi-team coverage and a 5-9's SLA requirement. 
Your average user can't keep up and is better served by Windows in 9.9/10 cases.
This is a moot debate anyway since desktop is dead and everyone just uses iOS or Android now. (iOS hardening out of the box is absurdly good, too)

Fair, but BTC's history is a bunch of logarithmic ATH's, followed by deep crashes, followed by the next ATH quite some time later. The linear chart shows this better than the log chart even (as when you log it, it evens out log raises..). Rinse. repeat. 100,000 is an easy target over 20,000 to hit in 2 years. What was it a few years ago? 100? then 1000? Now it peaked at 20k and sits quite substantially higher than where it was two years ago.

Like, I think it depends on how you view "adoption".
It came in layers.
1st wave. The deep compsci people, Defcon attendee hackers, super woke liberterian nerds, probably caught wind before the Gawker article.
2nd wave. The Gawker article wasn't "negative" news exactly. It was just like "hey there's a website you can buy drugs on, that takes an anon currency called bitcoin!". This caught the attention of mainstream nerds and hackers too busy to have paid attention to something lacking a killer app before that point. It was basically bitcoins "napster moment".
3rd wave. Government notices it, business starts noticing it.
4th wave. where we are now, super mainstream adoption, cyberpunk novel levels of corporate espionage and propaganda trying to derail or hijack the blockchain, wall st usage.
@_date: 2013-05-23 13:25:11

I don't grok the business model of selling mining rigs.
Anybody who can mass produce those things, WOULDN'T SELL THEM. They'd turn them around into datacenters and collect far more from mining, per rig, than they'd get, per sale. And that could keep going ad infinitum.
