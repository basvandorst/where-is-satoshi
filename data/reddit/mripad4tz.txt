Bing: Dish network, Expedia, 1800flowers, tiger direct, new egg, etc.  You will notice that after they announced their acceptance of bitcoin there is nothing.  Like did they get 1 bitcoin or ANYTHING.  They are all converting back to fiat and have no intentions of holding.  This trend will continue UNTIL a HUGE USE CASE SCENERIO DEVELOPS.

No man.  You said it yourself.  You have to go with what's in your heart.  Maybe it's day trading but make sure it's your thing.  I M O it's crypto and maybe just "preaching" and getting the word out.  Look what you have already done.  
The more you "research this shit", the more options you will find.

Tiger Direct customer service has no clue.  Do not use them!  I had similar issues and eventually went to Newegg.  To be honest, neither one of them were impressive.  We wonder why there is a constant drag on the PRICE?  I would bet anything they get is automatically converted out of Bitcoin.

Why should you trust it to not lose all value?  Bitcoin is "a process" .  There is no way anyone can answer that definitively.   I guess I would first look at your own currency and understand why there are so many problems.  Get yourself just a small % of a Bitcoin.  Then compare your currency and see which one proves to be the "strongest".   I'm guessing it won't take long.

Based on the way you are describing things, I would recommend you take just a little more time understanding Bitcoin.  Please don't take this the wrong way.   Search for Kritov Atlas and check out some of the videos and podcasts that he was involved in.  He"s excellent at explaining a lot of the security details of Bitcoin.  
@_date: 2015-03-07 22:42:06
I think we should try and explain why they all know what google is and go from there.  People can handle one or two clicks and that's it.  Google, Microwaves, VCR , DVD's, Email, Tv remotes, and keys for the car.  With Bitcoin it will have to be one click.  Even change tip is too much.  But we are getting there.

If you don't include a fee is there a chance your transaction will never go through?
[–]freeradicalx 4 points 3 hours ago 
Yes that's possible. In which case, I believe that after some time it'll leave the mempool (The queue of unconfirmed transactions) and look as if you never attempted the transaction. Money back in your wallet.

Edit: You said, "I have learned that people who don't particularly care about BItcoin are convinced the easiest when all the other services fail them".
Yes, very true.  Have a friend who recently was "converted".  After two days of constant frustation trying to get his money out of a betting exchange he finally gave in when the exchange recommended he take the money in Bitcoin.  I have spent the last year trying to get him to understand what it's all about but he never took the plunge.  Man, he is hooked now.  He already had a Airbitz wallet on his phone, so i just spent some time on the phone explaining what he needed to do.  They sent Him all the money almost immediately.  
Yes! I understand the security issues with all the money on  just one wallet.  We have taken care of that.  
@_date: 2015-10-03 20:57:20
So, I'm just asking here.  What "card" is credited?  I want to use the barcode on my phone via Airbitz wallet.  I'm still not understanding where the 20% discount comes from.  I assume at the point of sale, but just want to know for sure.

NYT did not do ONE STORY on the recent surge in price.  As a matter of fact, bing it and you will see nothing since October 2016.  It's always negative language associtated with Bitcoin.  It's the  performing currency in 6 of the last 7 years and somehow it is "MYSTERIOUS".  They are a joke.

10 years from now.  Lets say  this idea actually gets traction and works.  Has anyone considered the Alt Currency Market?  What about something like DarkCoin.

The philosophical point of bitcoin.  What about that? Yes, you pay a coinbase fee and yes you earn points using a credit card.  Are you going to care about the coinbase fee you paid when bitcoin gets back to $1,000 or higher? What if you got in when it was worth $5.00?   If you earn point with the credit card, why would bother with bitcoin?  Keep getting points and give Them more power than they already have.  The banks are loving it.  TAKE CONTROL!  That's what bitcoin is about!
