That's not dollars. With shipping.  It's  over $100. I missed out when they were $65-75 on amazon 
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:21:36
Nobody said it's not cool. Just to avoid fees.

Dude how many times do you have to post and get the same.damn answers. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:07:17
Thanks. Right now I just use CoinBase. I don't have much to justify a hardware wallet yet.  
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:59:15
But they don't know it. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:25:19
CoinBase app. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:27:34
Ah ok. Thanks.  So it's best to deposit money and use limit orders. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:27:57
Also an app. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:42:50
Damn. That sucks. I still remember. It was like 8 cents for a coin when I was in high school. I chose to use the money to buy a video game over btc lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:14:25
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:25:04
Yea. Do it. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:52:42
Even $20 back then would have been 2.5 million now. You'd have some serious money. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:30:35
Not much. But something is something.  I was stupid not to buy back 2009-2010 when I first seen it.  
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:33:51
What app is that. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:49:35
Out of the mobile wallets for Android. Which would you recommend.  I use to have greenaddress it. For .011 btc someone on Reddit tipped me. I forgot the password but still have the Mnemonic phase. Trying to figure out how to get it back. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:21:44
What about market orders. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:26:38
Get a job.  
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:27:19
You're late. It's already going down and up. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:45:56
Hard lesson to learn. My life is good and all. But damn. That would of changed it. Lol.  But for all I know. I Would've sold when it $10, $100, or $1000. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:32:58
If we knew that. Wouldn't you think people would dump everything they got.  
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:09:08
Because you didn't do it a week ago. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:15:11

@_date: 2018-02-16 00:23:50
Cool. Thank you. Would you happen to know if itll be an issue if i send the coins from gdax to the wallet. Heard some people not getting their coins because it was sent from a legacy address to segwit. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 00:55:42
Thanks. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 01:00:26
Cool. Thanks for the quick reply. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 00:22:44
Cool so its ok to send crypto from coinbase to the ledger if select segwit. I was searching for the thread, but seen a few where people had their coins stuck because it was sent from a legacy address to a segwit. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:22:50
Wow that's crazy generous.
