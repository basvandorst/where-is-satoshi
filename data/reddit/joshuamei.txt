Congrats, man!
@_date: 2019-07-24 14:31:29
I always see comments like this.. Of course, I am upset I didn't hold, but I don't know the future - so why beat myself up over it? 
I bought BTC back in 2011 and spent them all on Weed on Darknet. It's crazy when I look at my Blockchain account and it says that over 800 BTC has circulated that wallet. But I bought them for Weed, if it weren't for that I probably wouldn't have heard of BTC that early on. 
I went 20x on RaiBlocks in 2018 though, so I believe there are always new opportunities to be taken, no need to feel bad for those you missed out on.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:19:17
Ah damn. At least you have 2 BTC left mate. You should be glad, that's a good amount :)!
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:37:23
Yeah I know mate. It would take me a year to save up to 16,000$ though with my full time job. And then by the end of that year I doubt the price is still at 16,000$. Which explains my point of the impossible catch. Impossible for me that is. 
Not whining, just a fair observation. I got no one but myself to blame. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:37:00
Bro I'm in the same seat. My biggest transaction was 12 BTC back in 2011 or 2012. 
Sucks really, really hard. But you can't predict the future man, so don't beat yourself up. I am doing my best to get onto the train now, just putting every spare of change I got into BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:50:17
I haven't given up mate, just doing some observations. My intentions is definitely to hoard up on as much BTC as I can at this rate. Just talking about the possibility of an impossible catch-up to 1 Bitcoin in the near future. Being able to ride this wave with 1 Bitcoin in your wallet would be absolutely thrilling, but also nerve wrecking.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:29:32
Thank you bro, well said.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:41:02
Damn man. I guess everyone on this subreddit has their own story almost. 
I have by no way given up on Bitcoin. I am too gonna hoard anything I can get my hands on. I guess just my ego hates the fact that I lost the chance of owning 1 Bitcoin in these interesting times. 
Thanks for sharing!
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:12:31
That is pretty crazy. We're in for an exciting ride probably! I can imagine the ride being more exciting the more you invest as well, but also nerve wrecking. Thanks for the welcoming!
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:34:42
It isn't the fact that 16,000$ is a lot of money for me, even though it is — personally. I already have a full time job. 
My point is that the price rises so fast that I won't be able to catch up is all. Considering I don't have any savings I'm starting from zero. It would take me 8 months to save up to 16,000 if ALL my money went into bitcoin. I have to pay for food, rent and all that jazz. I believe in 8 months the Bitcoins will be well over 30,000$ atleast. Which is another year, then another year. Get my point?
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:18:30
Thank you! Sometimes the wind is so strong it pushes me away from my goals and path though. But I guess that's why I gotta keep visualizing as you said. Good luck to you as well man!
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:22:38
Thanks for writing that, made me feel much better. It definitely is an ego thing. The thought just stuck easier to my ego because I've seen 1 BTC at 9$ before. But you're absolutely right!
Cheers mate!
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:51:27
It was a [Link]( that said "[Transaction Accelerator]( Very deceiving because you didn't see the address, which was clearly a virus link.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:58:07
Thanks man, hard not to though.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:34:18
Didn't see there were instructions.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:12:31
Sick burn ��. Wasn't anything hardcore fortunately.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:20:35
What exactly will happen tomorrow that everyone is talking about? Is the price predicted to drop or rise?
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:43:43
That's the point I was trying to make in OP.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:51:14
Thank you man. Will do anything in my power to stay clean.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:45:36
Damn that's awesome man. How much money have you put into it since May?
And I'm sure it will man, just hodl :)
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:29:27
Yeah, that really seems impossible right now for someone like me hehe. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:40:40
Lucky dog :)
Good luck!
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:02:38
That is true, a more positive way of looking at it. I try not to get too upset about it because I intend for this long term now. I am really fascinated by BTC and am officially on board the hype train so to speak.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:09:29
Shortened URL was very obvious to me, so I never opened it.
Not sure what you can do now, it's fully possible to infect via browser without downloading any file that you see. Might be a drive-by. 
I say run a virus scan, or withdraw your wallet into a hardware one, and put it into a USB if you're seriously paranoid. Doubt a virus scann will work though, since I bet any hacker who uses a silent drive-by also fully crypts his virus.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:30:29
What is this you linked me? I don't know enough of Bitcoin to understand that. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:02:15
I hope this post didn't come out like I gave up on buying Bitcoin. I simply said it's pretty darn difficult for me to reach the 1 BTC club at this point. I put every spare money I can into Bitcoin, I've put lots of hobbies on the shelf because of this. 
Still good to be in the race indeed. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:25:35
That's really true man. I wouldn't have the balls to gamble that big amount though.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:59:17
Thanks for the estimate man. Glad I didn't take lower. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:41:54
LoL I wasn't planning on it. My stomach feeling is saying it isn't a bubble :)
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:16:04
Let's hope so.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:48:49
These threads make me so depressed. Bought BTC back in 2012, or when the price was at 9$ each. But I blew it all on drugs. I had the possibility of becoming a millionaire in my early 20's but I blew it on goddamn drugs... I will never be able to forgive myself for this.. 
I invested when it was at 19k for 172$. Better than nothing. But the hole in my stomach will never disappear :(..
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:53:44
Sorry you didn't understand my point, I hope it wasn't my bad writing. No I don't want the price to drop at all, I don't know where you read that. I just said that the upswing in prices is gonna make it hard to work up to 1 Bitcoin if you have a low wage job. Because in another month Bitcoin will be worth probably at least 20,000$, which is another 3,000$ dollar for 1 Bitcoin compared to now. I don't even make 3,000$ a month. Hence the impossible catch? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:26:59
Had just googled the prices of kidneys 10 minutes before I read this haha. I don't know about that though.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:51:37
Silkroad :)
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:59:07
10 years of sobriety sounds so appealing now. I hope and intend to be where you are in 10 years myself. 
Thanks for the kind words.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:17:06
16,000$ is definitely not a dream. But 16,000$ by today is a dream for me. Because if I were to save up to 16,000$ it would take me a year with my full time job. And as that year has passed I don't think I will be able to purchase 1 Bitcoin for 16,000$. Was I really that unclear that almost all commenter in this thread thinks I am talking about how 16,000$ is impossible to reach? It really isn't. I'm simple talking about the possibility of an impossible catch up as a student with a low wage job like me.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:18:24
Really shitty predictions, would bet my portfolio they'd be wrong by the second months prediction. 
@_date: 2018-08-20 20:44:31
Whenever posts like these are made, I'm so happy people up-vote it to the front page. 
Poor people like OP would probably be ignored if there wasn't an uproar. 
Hope you get your BTC back buddy. I sent out a tweet to them about this bullshit. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:50:11
Glad to help! Yeah, I fully agree :)
@_date: 2019-08-10 13:22:04
It seems that it's not opened up yet.
@_date: 2018-11-19 14:46:13
That was awesome, my dude. Well done. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:10:47
You underestimate the power of exponential growth. They are making huge jumps in technology in Africa. Instead of building the village first telephone line, they can just go get mobile phones right away because they're so commercially available now a days. Imagine in 2024, all 2015 technology will be ridiculously cheap and still capable of OS upgrades. And not to mention the impact that the Internet has on developing countries. We're living in a rapid evolving society, people adapt so fast without noticing — it's almost scary. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 22:46:56
ViaBTC worked great. How didn't anyone recommend a accelerator at first? It's confirmed now. This shit should be in sidebar. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 11:38:55
Would be great if they told me when choosing fees that either I pay 10% of my transaction in fee cost. Or I have to wait days for a confirmation.
@_date: 2017-06-21 13:28:49
Ok. To understand this correct I can send the coins that's in transaction to my wallet (1PvbmAKaRQtLC5ntvjYbJfUQxv2VdbN6DC) with the fee I paid for my last transaction, plus a priority fee? And then it gets back to my wallet? Sorry I'm a little noob here obviously. Is this what I have to do?
@_date: 2017-06-21 11:33:31
I could choose between 0.2 USD and 3 USD. Obviously I used 0.2 as I've never had any problems with that low fee for years. It's ridiculous if you have to pay 3$ for a 30$ transaction. 


 my ass. 
The fuck has happened in the last 7 months?
@_date: 2017-06-21 12:00:53
Yeah you're right. Anyone who doesn't understand the blockchain fully shouldn't be using Bitcoins. Only super serious users. Fuck the average person ending up using Bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 16:02:34
Wasn't compatible on my android. I tried VIABTC transaction accelerator though. hopefully it will work in a few hours.
Thanks for tipping on this transaction accelerator, never knew they existed. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 12:57:16
I used Blockchain wallet. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 13:44:11
Mah nigga
@_date: 2017-06-21 14:45:09
Yeah I tried. You're right. Guess I just have to wait then. 
Thanks for info.
