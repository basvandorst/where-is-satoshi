Stop me if I'm wrong, but that sounds an awful lot like regulation, and doesn't that go against bitcoin's ideals?  I'm guessing by stakeholders you mean bitcoin owners (and I heard that 1000 people have more than a 50% stake), and you want them to decide on changes that will affect all bitcoin users?

These are things that follow because it was the first.  Yes it is secure, but that's not particular to bitcoin.  It is still young and tiny in relative terms, I don't think its size is a compelling argument for why it will definitely take off.

Maybe regulation resistence is what makes it so valuable *now*, but why should that be of interest to the normal guy on the street?  The lack of governance, and its consequences, are exactly why I don't want to put my money into bitcoin.
Also I don't agree that lack of regulation is fundamentally what makes gives the internet value (though it does give some).  Even in countries with heavily regulated internet, it's still an invaluable resource.

As an impartial observer:
I think the idea of a cryptocurrency may be one that is viable for the masses in the future.  I don't think it's going to be bitcoin though.  The only major thing going for it seems to be that it was the first.  I think that when something like this does take off it will be far more regulated and stable.

I very rarely downvote people, but for this comment, I think it deserves it.  
If you want to treat people who don't share your view point like idiots, then you yourself clearly have a very shallow view of the world.  If you want to give a proper response I will listen, but otherwise I advise you stop trying to convince non-believers of the bitcoin cause, because you are very bad it.

Ah, condescension, are you upset about something I've said?
China has a pervasive internet censorship regime set in place.  But for example, you would be able to access this conversation between you and me there.  I'm not trying to justify internet regulation, I'm just trying to say that the internet has far more value than you are giving it credit for.

Well it was nice talking to you MeanOfPhideas.

I think you are wrong because ERROR: NullPointerException
Seriously though, I don't come to these boards very often, this is my own opinion that was formed in my own brain.  Why do I think being the first is the only thing going for it?  Well obviously because I don't see anything more than that.  Now explain why I'm wrong.

Clearly you do care since you are still responding.  Apparently you think you're 'calling out bullshit', but from my perspective: you didn't explain why what I said was bullshit, when I asked you why you implied I was too stupid to understand the answer, and you offered nothing but a condescending tone throughout, with no justification as far as I can see.
I don't know what it is that you think you've added to the debate here, but you haven't added it.

That can and will be the same for any cryptocurrency, present and future.  I was comparing bitcoin to these - what makes it special, other than being the first?
@_date: 2014-03-21 15:49:18
Oh ok, now I see your problem.  We would have got here a lot quicker if you hadn't expended so much energy trying to insult me!
Let's think about the statement 'bitcoin is special'.  A priori, is there any reason to think that is true?  The null hypothesis should surely be 'bitcoin is not special' and the onus is on others to explain why that is not the case.  Certainly it has more users, and a bigger value than other cryptocurrencies.  But this seems likely to be because it was the first, no?  
I'm not looking for your respect.  I'm looking for you to answer the question.

I doubt it's going to be any of the other crypt-currencies currently around either, they all have the same weaknesses.
