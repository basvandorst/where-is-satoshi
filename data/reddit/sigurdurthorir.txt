Yes,  but so you can be trusted tell them to send you emails from the same paypal email you have. Communicate through that. Then they can see it in the transaction info that it was the same email. So you are not abusing someone like the guy who was on here who got many thousands of dollars reversed from his bank account because some guy had been sending him money from bet365 and other hacked paypal accounts.

WHY YOU SHOULD BYPASS FIVERR:
I had a profile on Fiverr but when I put my money into Paypal after having in stored there they started deactivating my profile saying my picture was not good enough. Very strange timing and they would not stop, I always had to change the photo until I could not bother with them any longer. They also take 20% fee wich is ludacris. So when you pay somebody 5 $ you are giving 1 $ to fiverr. 
I think people should really move on from that site. Some people are working way to much for to little. Maybe in Indonesia 5 $ is much but not when they take 20% off your income and then Paypal takes its fee again. I would like a site that only does bitcoin and takes only 1% off. NOT 20%

I dont know but I predict a collapse to about 240-350 is going to be the next bottom point. Cant put out an exact number but I think something is going to happen. After that we might begin to see an increase again. But stay alert. Bitcoin is still small but will the big banks and such let bitcoin go mainstream without drama. If you can see what bitcoin will be in 2030 please let me know.

If you are buying you just need to login and click on a dealer and then you send an offer when the price is as low as you want, and then you can start sending messages to the seller. You can always cancel it if you don't like the price. Be sure to take screenshots of everything. And you don't have to get it sent to localbitcoins address if you don't want to.

I think you can use  as a link to a webstore with them and then they change your money instantly to your selected currency. Would check it out. I only know about them because they are also servicing auroracoin sellers community in Iceland.

Interesting. But they have not giving any clear statement yet. Usually I would say that it is China and they would not allow anything that they cannot control but I think China might be coming around since their middle class is waking up more and more. You can see inflation is on the rise and people are growing richer and more self confident. I know the leadership in China is looking for a new global currency since it is dumping the dollar but bitcoin is still in its birth stages but is evolving fast and is probably under some consideration. Since there is no country/religion or anything behind the currency people have no predjudice. It is like the North Pole. A neutral-zone. 
While the other options are for a global currency are just nation currencies that are very flawed and bias to the working of their economic situation.(or maybe just the 1%?!?)
I hope China is waking up. China has been very smart in their uprising money wise. They could flatten out the US economy if they wanted to. Regarding their neighbour, it came as a no surprise that Russia would ban transactions with bitcoin since you could guess anything that Putin connot control through his horse-leash would not be allowed.
All I have to say to that is free will will never be put in a barrel with a lid on.

Still there. 31000+ people have claimed their share of 330000 people. And they have enabled identification with the national registry just a few days ago. First there was only facebook and phone identification available. But then the phone thing went out. You can buy all kinds of stuff with it. Including suits, silver and whale watching.
Baldur had this to say in the news here yesterday:

The last sentence is a bit off in the translation. What it means is that while other countries are settling with bitcoin and integrating it China is a bit on its own special boat.

Would be great if it had an English version :)

I agree it is going to go down more. But it wont go as low as 240 I would say 280-350 could be the next point if a downward pressure becomes a trend. Don't forget the real price is coming up to about 130-140 now if we would be a realistic like the veteran financialists who saw this as a new Dot com-like tech bubble but in a long run I think everybody who owns bitcoins will see profit if they can wait 2-3 years to sell.

You are one negative Nelly. Its news in Iceland. We have had a horrid situation here since 2008 were you can only get foreign currency in cash if you show an airline ticket at the bank. So maybe somebody else is interested in the article and then they can read it. You don't have to. But if you click the link it moves up on their charts and then more people in iceland will read it and maybe come interested. Its that simple.

You are probably right. I just heard something about escrow but I am studying for exams don't have much time to look into it.

Men, I hope the central bank of Iceland is secretly buying up bitcoins in bulk. Then after 5 years when bitcoins are at 5000 $ a piece they can just switch out the icelandic krona for bitcoins.

Just because people have a degree doesn't mean they know something greater then you. Maybe they are getting drunk every weekend and are just content because they still get a cheque every month whether they know about bitcoin or not. Maybe just went into finance because "survival" and not because they care about it or have a natural liking to it, just survival and as long as that is met they are content.

I had a dream the price would go to 240$. I have had predicted dreams come true before but you never know quite for certain with dreams but then again I also had one that the price went to 300$

Auroracoin was way to high to begin with. I know some people who sold their families worh of Aur for 2.6 btc early on and made some money. So I guess the positive side is that it brought a lot of attention to cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin. But people here are also sheepsters like everywhere else. Unless they see bitcoin do really well they might consider it. But for auroracoin to be used as a national currency it has to much volatility. Since it is still in its "netscape" stages. But there is still much time left of the airdrop so we will have to wait and see.

Thanks for pointing that out. I watched the doc on Black Wednesday 
..the other day and find it has some relevancy on what is happening on this altcoin and bitcoin pump and dump and general psychology when everybody sell and all goes down just like China news on bitcoin. Weird how an open currency exchange can do much damage to a currency. Also very weird how the top people in government just heard about stuff happening on the radio and didn't seem to know much about what was going on. And how people can make so much money without doing no honest piece of work. haha. I guess hedge funds have more power then actual terrorist to affect millions of peoples daily lives with this kind of manipulation. There need to be some rules for this so peoples daily lives can be in peace from this kind of activities.

Lets face it. Wallstreet is already like a big casino. No thinking of the long term, just looking at short term gain and they will probably see the same thing in bitcoin. They just follow the money. And the potential for bitcoin to be used globally is great.

Its news if it is affecting the mass. Fluctuations in money markets are just bad or good news in the mass psychology. That are news that matter in that regard but I get your point, nothing new for the bitcoin veteran.

If the banks go tits up. You know people in my neighborhood used to go to the same pool to wash all their clothes about 60 years ago. Now we all have washing machines. The same thing will happen to money too so instead of being project manager for a bank you can be project manager for peoples own bank/bitcoin wallets. But that invironment will probably change drastically also. Ofcourse there will be jobs, even more I would think, how much money do you think companies have made selling every home a washing machine?

 - Have not heard anything bad about it but do not bet on a bet that is just closing, that is the only way in the terms they can take your money. And there was a case, but I think now they are just refunding late bets. I like this site because you can create your bet. And I have tried but it does not say in their FAQ but I found out over email that your bet is guaranteed acceptance if you place 10btc or more on your new bet. Anything under that bitbet allows themselves to contemplate acceptance or not. I tried placing a bet and placed under 1 btc and I simply got it refunded after they rejected it.

It is mostly taken from a large conference in Harpa, Reykjavík about bitcoin last wednesday. The first public conference about bitcoin in Iceland with panel talks and experts in finance, one a chief economist in Eve online, a game that has had its own currency for a while. 
Edit: The article is advocating that Iceland should be open to Bitcoin.

Yeah, fuck Norway, their law in 2014 banning banks to deal with crypto exchanges(remember Justcoin exchange) cost me a lot of money! That's is not a very free market where lawmakers just pass laws banning free trade. We got the same thing happening in India and Marocco, fuck these economies, not going to recommend moving mine or any business to those countries.
