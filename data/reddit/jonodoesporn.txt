You will make 4BTC

Doug Polk is highkey the best voice in Crypto YouTube. Only guy I trust, aside from maybe Crypto Investor.

Tesla’s intrinsic value is that they fucking make cars, man.
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:06:05
Correct.

Like you, I’m definitely more liberal than libertarian, but you can’t deny that the entire ethos of bitcoin is very much libertarian, and in some ways antithetical to many liberal positions.

The difference is semantics.

I believe Ronnie Moaz and Andreas have both said this year that the total number of users is somewhere between 8 and 12 million.

It wouldn't surprise me. I only got in about a month ago and it's been too expensive to justify moving my coins out of an exchange. Waiting for broader Segwit support/LN before I do. Even in the subset of people who understand the tech, I imagine I am not alone in this.

Step two: fail to buy the dip.

This happened at 10k, too

PayPal fees, especially for small businesses and charities, are pretty brutal.

He got one timeframe wrong. He’s right in principle.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:35:38
It sounds like you’re just upset that you sold. Buy the next dip and get onboard again.
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:30:01
They can, but with fees and transfer times it’s not as profitable as you’d think.
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:08:59
Yes. Seriously.

Depends on the terminology you use (i.e. hype vs adoption). You could just as easily say that Bitcoin becomes more valuable as scarcity increases in relation to *n* holders. 
So you're right—BTC is only worth more because it is coveted. Much like gold, or other precious commodities (and yes, I'm aware gold has practical uses, but traditionally it has been a store of value moreso than a traditional material). Is it a bubble, or is the supply just incredibly limited in respect to the number of people accessing the currency? We'll have to find out.

And what would a system like that look like? I imagine no one talking to each other or sharing space with each other or anything. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:18:05
There is a weird price hike in our exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:33:05
You don’t think we’re seeing right now a bunch of people who don’t understand BTC jumping onboard?
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:51:06
Yeah, but that’s a resource controlled by a centralised cartel. Not a good parallel to make.

@_date: 2017-12-08 05:43:26
Something weird happened at BTCMarkets. I assumed it was correcting closer to the exchange rate, but we're way back up again. You got any idea what causes the premium?
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:39:01
Yeah, I’d say so.

Because rebranding at best confuses and at worst does not inspire investor confidence
@_date: 2018-03-03 04:13:50
They did not give a date in advance, which would have been the responsible and transparent thing to do.
@_date: 2018-04-18 13:48:55
Almost like it’s not real
