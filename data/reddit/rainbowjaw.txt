Really this is such a split community it's sad, most people get very hostile very fast. Here is a discussion i had with someone. We have slightly opposing views, but it kind of gives a good overview of what the community and developer situation is like.

Hes giving stats and sourcing the data... If you have different data bring it up,  don't  just call him names. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 16:06:37
That is backwards. A spam attack is only effective because it *creates* higher fees. A spam attack is is exponentially more expensive with a larger blocksize.  It has to outbid everyone either way, and there is a much higher ceiling with larger block sizes. 
In order to attack a chain with blocks below max capacity, spam has to pay to reach max capacity, then start a bidding war with itself and legitimate transactions. 
Having higher fees to begin with just means that there is no reason to do a spam attack.

And logical fallacies, dont forget those!

Nowhere does it say they withdraw from the agreement. 


Pretty much says that they want 2x, would like to follow the agreement, but if the market doesn't accept 2x as bitcoin, they will support the market.

Really its a more complicated feedback loop,  every player is leading and following.

also i know every one love to hate on miners in this club, but

lol whats your problem. Do you work for Nvidia? Or maybe invested in them?
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:16:29
Also says they will follow the market. And if the market doesn't follow core then that isn't following core is it?
@_date: 2017-08-07 15:41:22
Its true it wasn't more than a 1/3 drop. That was just a correction. Hes talking about mtgox kind of drop,  which i dont think could possibly happen on the same time scale

Word dude.  I think the truth is starting to form somewhere in combination. I appreciate your responses,  helps narrow down the bull shit and helped fill in the details to build a better picture.  Glad you pointed out the roger ver and bitmain angle,  i definitely *don't* see them as honest actors.  
I don't mean to say all of core is bad,  as you point out its not exactly a unified group. Some of the more celebrity core developers aren't honest either though,  they regularly misrepresent their position and use crowd manipulation to push their agenda.  But maybe they've just been shaped to defend themselves that way. 
Although I wish a split didn't happen,  ultimately it may be good for bitcoin.  The sourness in this space comes from opposing points of view,  people acting in their own best interest. Now those separate interests can compete for the best solution for a network. 
Im curious what you think of all the blockstream talk,  plenty of bullshit but also some valid concerns in my opinion. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:06:07
Well what value does it add? Connecting via attomic swap sounds good *once* its implemented,  but as of right now litecoin barely does anything. 
Since it started it just been a vanilla clone of bitcoin. If you aren't going to use bitcoin, there are more feature rich networks with larger adoption than litecoin. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 20:32:23
Now that people hear about bitcoin and ethereum other places,  i can finally stop talking about it.

Op is just chirping like a bird repeating the song he's heard. he doesn't know what he is talking about. 
1. Segwit has been locked in (not activated),  the 2x part is the second part of the NY agreement,  raising the blocksize limit to 2mb.
2. 2x creates more immediate capacity for transactions. If anything its bad for miners in the short term,  it reduces fees. The pools that want 2x want it for the longterm growth of bitcoin,  and to bypass core who have been ignoring the community. Not all pools are for 2x.
3. Core does not want a blocksize increase,  and 2x would usurp their power as developers, so they badly dont want it. 
4. There is no segwit8x hes referring to bch i assume.

The most competent bitcoin developers have left for other projects again and again. Just because a group has control over github, reddit, and BCT doesn't make them the most competent, it makes them the most LOUD. 
The NYA agreement was practically identical to the HK agreement. 2x gained support because it's what the majority of the market has wanted for over 3 years. It's been actively stalled by core for those 3 years. Why would they do this?  
Miners are in it for the long term, they want bitcoin to survive and thrive, this idea that miners are trying to destroy bitcoin is ridiculous, they have more of a stake in bitcoin than most anyone.  If they wanted short term profits, they wouldn't ask for a mb increase *or* segwit as both immediately reduce fees.
@_date: 2017-08-04 02:35:55
Depends. If segwit2x doesn't go through (the 2x part) bitcoin cash is gonna be worth a lot more than it is now. If the 2x part goes through, $100 seems about right, if not too high.

A what script? 
@_date: 2017-08-22 18:56:47
Fair enough, I'm happy to get called out on any logical fallacies, or exaggerations, these forums need to create a safe place for debate. 
The only reason that Segwit2x goes around core is because core refuses to participate in the community and *only* pushes their own agenda.  What their agenda is, is up for debate. Pushing the assumption that they are they 100% have the best interests of bitcoin at heart makes **me think** that any one who unfalteringly supports core is intentionally misleading people who don't know better.  The truth is sharded between different sub communities and communication channels, and there is enough propaganda/misinformation/smokescreens that it can't be entirely clear to any one. It's impossible to know any one's intentions, only the implications of their actions. 
**Here are the facts as I have observed them**
Time flies real fast in crypto, discussions of impending scaling problems go back at least 3 years. HKA was only 1.5 years ago, I apologize for any thing misleading or exaggeration there.
HKA was feb 2016, it's now august 2017. A year and a half ago an agreement was made to bring segwit and a MB increase.  Core began a campaign against the MB increase. The agreement fell apart.  At the same time users were reporting being banned for numerous reasons, including discussions around a block size increase. Which is why the other bitcoin subreddit originally came to exist.  Bitcoin remained stalled in it's development, and neither any on chain, or segwit solution was gaining any ground.
It's important to note that lots of people were interested in segwit and a block size increase **but couldn't talk about it** without getting pruned from There is plenty of evidence for this.
Then, segwit2x came around. Core wasn't giving the community what they wanted so they bypassed them, yet they remained mostly silent about it if not encouraging it.  Suddenly the community agreed. 
It had fluctuating between 90-95% support from miners and nodes because people were finally being given what they were asking for.  Segwit goes through, and then again, core starts the campaign to block what is being signaled by the community for what they want. 
You could argue that there is plenty of game theory being played, and that those that wanted segwit only cooporated because they could pull out later, but again who is being dishonest here?
I'll maintain that a blocksize increase has been stalled and suppressed through the community outreach channels since blockstream entered the equation, and that many good developers, have left because of the stall.

Only that it is a version out out by a different developer group.  it breaks the illusion that only one developer team should be making code for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 15:05:19
Not sure why you are downvoting me.  What are we arguing about again? Network capacity and spam? I guess time will tell if eth falls apart because of its blockchain size, or if bitcoin becomes too expensive to use cause its blockchain is too small.  Hopefully segwit will be the utopian fix for all of bitcoin's problems as it claims to be. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 23:58:06
Eh, traders and speculators only care about price and ratios, and there are plenty of those affecting the price that don't give a fuck what fork wins.  Not saying they have a bigger stake than the long game though.

Actually eth also solves this by having a dynamic blocksize.  They solved network capacity problems created by ICOs most recently by raising the limit. 
You dont raise the limit "arbitrarily large" you raise it enough to make spam attacks even more expensive and below the point of significant node drop offs. 
Spam attacks on BCH and BTC simultaneously have already shown that it is much more expensive to have an effect on a network with less full blocks. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 04:13:05
Heard of pruning? Eth network doesn't need every node to be a full node.
