Meditate. I don’t do it enough myself, but the weeks where I wake up early and meditate every morning are the weeks I feel on top of the world. People brush off meditation like it’s a joke, but you will understand how great it is when you try it.
I suggest starting with guided meditation through an app like Headspace.

While I agree with your overall premise that putting nearly all your capital into one asset isn’t smart, comparing Bitcoin to the lottery, blackjack, or any other casino game really isn’t fair. What Bitcoin has that those games don’t is proven returns. Over the last 6 years there’s been basically no way to lose money on Bitcoin (unless you’re trying to day trade it), whereas playing any one of those games you mentioned is statistically going to lose you money.
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:46:45

Not a shadow account, my best best guess is that someone with a long list of leaked emails opened a ton of accounts with each email, but used their own phone number or 2FA. So when someone uses the account made for them, the hacker can just recover the account and steal the funds.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:46:48
Nope, but people got super hyped about it and put a fuck ton of money in companies with great visions. Then proceeded to lose their life savings because turns out 90% of the money flowing in was based off hype.
I know families that went from employed with a 6 figure salary to unemployed, and almost on the street because of the dot-com bubble.
Sure, you can say these people were stupid for investing what they can’t afford to lose, but if you think even for a minute that people aren’t doing the same with crypto, you must be blind.

That's not true at all, tons of people trade bitcoins without exchanges. Did you forget that an exchange at it's heart is just a transfer between two people at an agreed price? Check out if you really think exchanges are the only to turn bitcoins to cash.

I think you need to do more research, because these are facts. Penny stocks? Do you not remember 4 months ago when Ethereum was $30? Litecoin isn't some $.0001 altcoin, it's the third largest coin in the crypto-world. Stop spreading misinformation.

Why would anyone keep their equity in cash, that's a terrible investment.
@_date: 2017-06-27 20:04:25
You are right, just like a bank. Except banks don't store your money, they loan it out to other people. So if something like what happened in 2008 happens again and the banks (coinbase in this case) invest in a metric ton of subprime loans, they declare bankruptcy. When that happens, any debts they owe, including that 2 BTC you gave them to store, doesn't have to be paid back. Another example is MtGox, the world largest bitcoin exchange of its time. It ended up being "robbed" of nearly $500 million in bitcoin and declared bankruptcy, AKA no one gets their coins back.
Depending on what crypto you are storing in Coinbase, you can download a wallet. If it's bitcoin then use [this wallet]( If it's ethereum then [this one]( and last but not least if it's litecoin the use [this one](
Don't be embarrassed! I'm glad you asked. If you have more questions, I'd love to answer them!
@_date: 2017-06-08 19:40:59

I was referring to his statement that licensing is useless. I agree that this particular license is stupid, but all licenses? Not so much.
@_date: 2017-06-07 11:27:11
It's possible, but its important to do not only technical analysis, but fundamental analysis when researching cryptocurrencies. You can't just look at the past and predict the future, you need to look at current and future events. Such as this whole SegWit thing. In August BTC will have a massive shitstorm, and it's highly probable that investors, fearing instability, will pump their money into LTC and out of BTC.
Either way, LTC is such a small investment compared to BTC.  At $30 it doesn't take much to invest, making it a lot easier to leverage gains.
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:57:13


@_date: 2017-06-27 19:52:15
If your coins are stored in a Coinbase wallet, they're not yours, they still belong to Coinbase. If they go under and become insolvent for example, your coins go *poof*. That's why it's always good to store your crypto on your own hardware.
@_date: 2017-06-12 11:37:05
That's kind of the point though, the community is divided.
@_date: 2017-06-07 16:24:41
Incredibly low transaction fees, faster processing times, dedicated developers, united/supportive community, no scaling issues, huge market cap yet still low price (AKA undervalued), and it is just beginning to mature. Exchanges are beginning to adopt it, causing the price to rise. Once the shitshow goes down with BTC in August, investors will sell and pump their earnings into ETH and LTC. Both are good investments, but LTC is severely undervalued right now, where as ETH has already spiked a ton in the last couple months.
@_date: 2017-06-07 03:32:20
It's definitely not to late for LTC, it's just barely maturing. If you're looking to make the most gains, Litecoin is definitely the way to go.
@_date: 2017-06-06 02:12:24
Indeed, but you shouldn't live in the idea of "what could have been."
@_date: 2017-06-08 19:40:09
Agreed.
