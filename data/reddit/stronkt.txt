Insurance against what?  I'm interested in options that will protect me if bitcoin fails.  Coinbase has insurance against loss for the coins they hold for me but won't help me if bitcoin fails.

It seems that when it comes to bitcoin, if you're comfortable buying on your own, you have way more flexibility.  I can even go buy bitcoin that is not tied to my identity that no one will know I have.  So if no one knows I have it, they can't try and take it from me.

This is where we have to better understand the intent, and I certainly do not have time for that.  But at face value, it does appear to be motivated by prejudice when looking at everything they said. 
  
If they were using the DMCA to protect IP, that is one thing, if it to suppress a voice based on race\religion\group affiliation, that is discrimination.
@_date: 2015-03-02 17:25:20
Using DMCA claims to censor reporting is suppressing free speech.  That is active discrimination.

No Capital Gains sounds very nice.  But I can achieve this by just buying anonymous BTC.

Looks like they support litecoin and dogecoin too.  Interesting!

I've come to the same conclusions after reading more about Roth IRAs.  Seems like the best long-term investment vehicle for me in terms of taxes but I don't know if the extra strings are worth avoiding the long-term capital gains and the flexibility I get by holding the underlying asset.  I need to learn more.  But it is looking like I might start maxing out what I can put into a Roth IRA.

That makes no sense because if they had stolen 4 million worth of bitcoin, it would be even harder to find and no one would be mounting a manhunt.  You should stop submitting stuff here when you're high.

Bitcoin is stolen all of the time and your chances of recovering it are a lot less than your chances of recovering stolen gold.

That's a lot more than the 1k active users we see on the sidebar!  Thanks for that info.
@_date: 2015-03-03 00:32:36
But there are limits how much I can invest per year.  I have no limits with buying the asset directly.  And I have to wait for 5 years and reach the age of 59.5 in order to divest tax free.

Your premise is not correct.  You are wrong to say that anyone is given more wealth for no reason.
@_date: 2015-03-02 23:10:05
I do wonder how many people actually read this forum and how much of an impact we have over the whole thing.  If there really was 150k people here and we really could move in a united manner, I think you're right and we could bump the price.  
@_date: 2015-03-02 22:24:16
At least you were smart enough to create a throw-away before you started talking out of your ass.

How is not open discrimination if he is posting it on FaceBook and it is being reported on?  Using one entity to suppress the voice of another sounds a lot like discrimination.
@_date: 2015-03-02 22:36:22
I looked into this because I have a 401k through my work and my work matches what I put in.  But I can't do this with my employer 401k, I would have to open my own and the benefits aren't clear to me.  It still looks like buying the asset directly from coinbase offers me more flexibility.
  
What did I miss?  What is the diversity that is attractive to you?

5000 what?
@_date: 2015-03-02 22:30:07
They have a lot of investment experience, they have their own fund for investing in start-ups.  Also, like you mentioned, they were born with a silver spoon, which means they have been exposed to this type of thing much more than your average person.  They went to the best schools and they hang around the most affluent.  They know how to make financial decisions and they can tap the best of the best if they have any questions.
  
They are very active in the bitcoin space, attending conferences, networking with and investing in start-ups, they are well connected with the bitcoin community.

I see what you're saying.  I still don't see how this isn't a contradiction for Bruce.  I don't know the whole story but it appears this guy has discriminated using the DMCA claims to censor reporting.  That is suppressing free speech and I assume it is because of his prejudice.
@_date: 2015-03-03 00:45:26
I'm very interested to know why a bitcoiner would want to invest in bitcoin using this method when it comes with so many rules as opposed to just buying the underlying asset.  I see why non-bitcoiners would want to, but I don't see the opposite.
@_date: 2015-03-02 16:36:45
Please help me understand this a little better.  You work on discrimination, I assume that means you work against discrimination.  Yet you support someone who openly discriminates and want them to be a success?
  
@_date: 2015-03-02 22:38:43
That's a good question and honestly I don't know.  But it's the only thing I'm really worried about since I am comfortable managing my own bitcoin.  I can see how these funds will be attractive to people who already invest in stocks on their own but I don't do that.
@_date: 2015-03-02 23:16:57
So if someone points a gun at your head and tells you "your bitcoin or your life", you would be an idiot to turn over your bitcoin?  As bitcoin grows and continues to be adopted, this possibility also grows.  I would be careful not to let anyone know your real identity, because if bitcoin really does live up to its potential, you may find yourself a target.  For someone like me, the only thing standing in the way of me being able to save my own life is a password and a 2FA code texted to my phone.  And I would most certainly give up my bitcoin for my life.

Not all retirement funds.  Especially ones that people have through their employers, I tried.  And all of the ones I can go out and get on my own come with all kinds of rules that make just buying the asset more appealing.  I'm genuinely looking for a good reason to buy bitcoin using this vehicle, but I can't find the benefit.  I do agree that this will be appealing for people who already invest in this manner.
  
@_date: 2015-03-03 17:13:25
That makes no sense, are you trolling me?

Is this better than just buying bitcoin on coinbase and sitting on it?  Either way, you still have to pay capital gains.  Is there some kind of protection where if bitcoin fails I don't lose all my money?
@_date: 2015-03-02 21:51:40
Not me.  I can't find any advantage to it.  I can already buy this asset from Coinbase and I have to pay capital gains with both.  Neither offer protection if bitcoin fails but with coinbase, I can control the actual asset if I want or use it to invest in something else.
Why do you want to buy GBTC when you can just buy bitcoin?  What is your perceived advantage?
