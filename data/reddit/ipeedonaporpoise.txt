It doesn't create an inherent value, it just simply makes the bitcoin available. The value of anything is determined by demand. The value of an oz of gold, for example, is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it. That's why the price fluctuates. Same with bitcoin.

Wasn't their some controversial aspects of both SegWit and unlimited?

I'm just concerned this might open the door for corruption. No matter the benefits, compromising the thesis of Bitcoin/block chain, even in the smallest way, is essentially the creation of loopholes. A way for people to manipulate the foundation that makes bitcoin/block chain great.

Not what I'm implying at all. Changes made that are not verifiably beneficial, based on an established set of rules, will mean that any detrimental manipulation that is aloud to slip by is in contrast to the foundation of Bitcoin/block chain. How many flaws are we OK with? Who decides what flaws are aloud and what ones aren't? Small changes can accumulate. The sum of which could potentially benefit people, businesses, governments, or whoever else successfully finds, or even implements  these changes. I'm thinking, allowing flaws gives power to a select few. Having a strick no flaw policy would protect its integrity.

Democracy only works with compromise. Voting is divisive. It makes room for flaws and inevitably leads to corruption. Compromising is what creates loopholes. Democracy is in direct contrast to the thesis behind Bitcoin/block chain. 
What if we didn't use it to implement changes, but only to define how to change it and never deviate? 
- define Bitcoin and it's thesis.
-  define logical fallacies etc 
- 6 month (year? I'm not a programmer) period to discuss and dispute. Burden of proof. Upon proof, retort. Etc. 
- Zero flaw policy. No compromise. 
- Frome here people decide if they want to use it.
- any potential open dispute/deviation from established rules can result in a new crypto currency. 
 
-Only verifiably flawless changes

Can we dumb this down a bit? Still not following. And what's bitcoin?

Spending it is what it's for. It's a currency. Sorry to hear about your struggle though.

I'm a artist by profession. I offer btc as my preferred method of payment.  At the moment, i only buy expensive items with btc and eat the high transaction fees. Only two businesses in my area offer btc as methods of payment. I used to pay with btc all the time, but btc sucks balls at the moment.

I will sue you. Now if I can just find a law firm that accepts bitcoin as payment... Looks like your off the hook.
