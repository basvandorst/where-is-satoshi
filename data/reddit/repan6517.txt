You probably don't want to hear this, but keeping these bitcoins open you up to rather dire legal issues.  For one, you have to figure out for certain where these coins came from.  If they came from the bitfinex hacker and are stolen coins, you can be charged with felony possession of stolen goods.  Even if you play ignorant and say you don't know, you're still setting yourself up for this charge.  Consult a lawyer, but I believe ignorance (and willful ignorance) is not an excuse.  Secondly, accepting a "gift" opens you up to tax obligations.  Even if this comes from a legit source you still have to pay taxes on it.  I wouldn't count on anonymity either.  I know you deleted your comment history (mostly but many people already saw and probably saved your history.  It wouldn't take much effort to unmask your identity given a determined party.  On top of that, the stolen coins are being tracked by probably every major exchange.  Moving them to an exchange and trying to sell them will open you up to even more problems.  I was telling people last week to NOT give out a public address and NOT accept these coins because whoever got them was going to be in a giant legal mess.  I'm sure you don't want to hear this, but you really, really need to consult a lawyer to see if you can return the coins and untangle yourself from this mess without falling on the wrong side of the law &amp; taxes.

What kind of "Christian voice"?  The kind that promotes bigotry, racism, and sexism?  The kind that subtly implies "I'm a christian and therefore more ethical than you"?  The kind that seeks to spread their outdated, and often immoral ethics and mythology presented as truths via missionary work?  The kind that humbly asks for donations under the guise of charity, and then keeps massive portions for themselves?  The kind that rejects scientific discovery because it does not conform to your own delusions?  The kind that tries to undermine democracy with theocracy?  The kind that ignores the evils inspired by and committed by other members of their faith simply by dismissing them as "not true christians" even though they're following some teachings of christianity to the T?

Sounds an awful lot like the story behind that weak "update" is that Bitfinex may have asked BitGo to drop or weaken some of the restrictions required to move coins.  Whether or not Bitfinex did this themselves or it was done through social engineering on the part of the hacker would still be a detail that needs to be known.

Bitcoin never purported to be anonymous.  


Paying with bitcoin is just as fast as a credit card, and for money transfers, bitcoin is orders of magnitude faster.
 &gt; robust
Bitcoin has basically worked as advertised for over 6 years now. 51% attacks are increasingly difficult, impractical, and expensive to attempt.


You can set whatever fees you want.  I often send bitcoins with zero fees and have never had a problem.  Coinbase spread is very small and fees are low.  Many exchanges have zero trading fees.


There are thousands of nodes.


Any changes to the protocol can and will be made once options are laid out on the table, evaluated, and a consensus for the best option emerges.
You say you still own bitcoins yet expect it to be sub $60 in a year.  You're a hypocrite and you bash your own self-proclaimed investment.  You're irrational and can be ignored. 
@_date: 2015-06-06 23:29:56
You're simply wrong.  Even with credit cards.  Credit cards confirm a lot faster than 10 seconds.  And any vendor that uses a payment processor does not have to wait for blocks to confirm.

In dollar denominated purchasing power (because BTC isn't there yet - maybe someday), lets say those fees amount to an average of $30 per block.  Nothing special, and it is dwarfed by the 25BTC / $5600 block reward.  Fast forward say 9 years from now when the block reward is only 6.25BTC but increased adoption has pushed the fees up to say 1BTC per block on average and BTC is worth 10x what is is now.  Then the fees amount to an extra $2300 - nothing to sneeze at.  Fees collected by miners will both grow bigger in BTC terms and in purchasing power as time passes.

@_date: 2015-06-01 21:17:27
Transaction volume has to grow to support more cumulative transaction fees.  If we were to suddenly cut off the supply of new bitcoins and block rewards suddenly became only transaction fees, miners would be left with far too little income.  Network hash rates would plummet, opening bitcoin up to a 51% attack.  I believe the idea is for transaction fees to grow into the gap left by diminishing block rewards and that process takes time.

Roughly every 4 years the block reward for BTC is cut in half.  It originally started as 50BTC per block.  Now it is 25BTC.  Next Summer it gets cut again to 12.5BTC.  This process is what keeps the maximum amount of BTC that can ever be created to 21M BTC.

I know the number of nodes has trended lower for at least a year (see  and I think I remember it trending lower before that but I can't find a chart.  Are you sure that when you're referencing the number of nodes decreasing when the soft limit increases, that is not simply part of this overall downward trend? 
Also don't forget correlation does not imply causation.  On the surface it seems like a reasonable hypothesis that increases in block size would lead to fewer nodes due to increased resource requirements and cost, but I don't believe we have sufficient test data to support this hypothesis yet.  At the very least I think you would want to measure the node drop-off curve with different sized blocks.  It could turn out that 2MB blocks do not make any statistical significant dropoff in the number of nodes, but 8MB may make a significant difference.

The laws of economics and bitcoins activity around that period almost certainly show you are wrong.
November 28 2012 was the first halving.  Bitcoin more than doubled in price from around $5 to $12 between the Summer of 2012 and Nov 28.  Immediately after the halving, a big pump began - driving bitcoin from $12 to well over $100.  Say what you will about the Gox shenanigans happening during that pump, but it is undeniable that the decrease in new BTC supply led to fewer coins being sold to cover mining costs which put upward pressure on the price.  That is economics 101 and you cannot deny it.

I know you're joking and the Bitstamp hack is clearly bad news.  It's just not really that important in the grand scheme of bitcoin.  
Bitstamp is a first-gen exchange, with first-gen security, first-gen management, and first-gen communication.  The first-gen exchanges need to be weeded out of the system and they are.  Gox is dead.  Bitstamp as it is should either die or be completely re-vamped and re-branded by somebody that has a long track record of trust and security.  And BTCe will die at some point too.  
The second-gen exchanges / payment processors like Coinbase and BitPay and Circle are a big step up, but just wait until you can buy bitcoin directly from Schwab or Interactive Brokers or the like.  I know lots of people hate regulation (and I'm adverse to it myself), but enforcing *just* *enough* regulation into the bitcoin environment so that the big, established players start supporting it will do wonders for bitcoin's adoption.
We're on the right track, but still have a long journey ahead.

Unless 1 satoshi becomes so valuable that it becomes worth more than the cheapest thing you could want to buy, then bitcoin has zero incentive (and indeed a disincentive) to become more divisible.  1 bitcoin would have to be worth well over $1M USD at current rates for an increase in divisibility to make any sense.  Even as bitcoin bull, I think that is dreaming.

Miners are the sole source of new bitcoins and they have very high incentives for those bitcoins to be worth as much as possible.  It seems rational and probable that given the opportunity, miners absolutely would temporarily suppress prices if they knew they could take some action at a later date that would "undo" the suppression.  But this would be true of anybody holding a large number of coins that still wanted to accumulate more.  Some people love bitcoin and others hate it, but everybody wants to make money.  With the right influence, bitcoin can be a very easy way to make a lot of money.  At first after reading this guy Andreev's comment I was thinking he's just being crazy and optimistic.  But after more consideration I think he might be hitting the nail on the head.  Keyword is "rational".  There is a *very* rational reason for bitcoin power brokers to temporarily suppress the price.

How about a max blocksize that adapts to provide a consistent transaction fee (or maybe consistent fee per KB)?  I'll use .0001 as an example.
Let's say the current max blocksize and the mempool grows over 1MB.  Let's say lots of transactions are happening and the mempool reaches 3MB.  Estimate the 1MB of transactions that are likely to be removed from the mempool during the next block by sorting the mempool by fee per kb.  Take the remaining 2MB that will be left in the mempool, calculate the fee per kb.  Use some kind of rolling average number of transactions per block to estimate the number of transactions that will occur in the next block.  Use that number and what is currently in the mempool to calculate a block size that will yield the targeted transaction fee.

I'd rather keep it denominated in bitcoin.  I don't want any weird ties to fiat.  If bitcoin were to eventually be worth $10000, that'd be a 
$1 transaction fee...seems fairly large but it would have the benefit of discouraging spam transactions.  I suspect by the time we'd reach $10000 many more transactions would be done off-chain.
@_date: 2015-07-12 03:24:15

@_date: 2015-07-08 17:59:56


Dramatic much?  Transactions are verifying EXACTLY as they should be.  What happened to you (and I hope you understand this) is that the spammer out-competed your transaction through higher fees.  This likely happened because you were using a wallet that did not use a smart floating fee.  It's not your fault, and it's something that I openly state needs to be addressed.  The spammer is spending several BTC per hour to do this, and all they've managed to do is push up the required transaction fee to .0015 BTC (40 cents) to be confirmed in the next block.  You can even get away with a cheaper transaction of around 20 cents if you don't mind waiting a few blocks.  
Understand that the attacker has to spend an exponentially growing amount of money to increase the attack - they start to have to compete with their own transactions.  For example, as I pointed out yesterday in another post, they'd have to spend nearly $1M per day to maintain an attack that would only drive up the fee to a mere $3.  And they'd have to be buying thousands of BTC per day on the open market to support the attack.  That would drive up the price, making your BTC worth more and making their attack get more and more expensive.

Bitcoin has worked far better than anybody expected over this last 48 hour stress test.  It gives me a lot of confidence that it would be able to handle full adoption for a country like Greece with very few issues.   Transaction fees would be a little higher (still very cheap), and wallets &amp; nodes would need to be upgraded to gracefully handle larger mempool sizes, but other than that not much would change.

Would you agree that wallets need to implement a floating fee by default that adjusts to a level so that the transaction would more likely than not be included in the next block?

No, nothing can happen until 2016 at the earliest.  If 75% of the hashing power is voting for 8MB blocks at that time, a hard fork will take place.  We'll be able to track what the hashing power is voting for well ahead of time, so we'll see it coming very clearly and everybody can plan for it.  So far from a done deal at this time, but it looks promising for the start of 2016.

You have a minor error - 1 bitcoin will have to be worth $1,000,000 before a single cent equals a satoshi.  Bitcoin is divisible to 8 decimal places.  A $1,00,000 BTC would mean 1 dollar would be equal to 100 satoshis or 1 uBTC.

Napkin math time.  The average full 1MB block has roughly 2000 transactions.  If a spammer wanted to disrupt everybody using &lt;= .0001 BTC fees, they'd have to spam 2000 x .0001 = .2BTC per block every 10 minutes (10 minutes being the average block time).  Or 1.2BTC per hour.  In reality, they'd have to out-compete everybody using higher fees as well - including those that use smart floating fees in wallets that support that.  So that 1.2BTC is a bare minimum and would probably be substantially higher.  But a .0001 fee is less than 3 cents.  Let's say the spammer really wanted to mess with us and drive the average fee 100x higher - up to $3 or .01BTC.  They'd be spending 120BTC every hour minimum.  At $300 per BTC, that'd be 120BTC * 24 hours per day = ****A bare minimum of nearly $1,000,000 dollars per day minimum to sustain an attack that only drives up the required transaction fee to $3. ****  And to fund that, the attacker would have to be buying 2880BTC per day on the open market.  Needless to say, that would drive up the price like crazy and make their attack ever more expensive.
I used to be in favor of increasing the block size, and maybe I still am to some small extent, but after the last 24 hours it is not something I worry about anymore.
Somebody please refute me if I've made any gross errors here.

I had the same "due diligence" thought yesterday.  If I were a giant player of some sort, I would certainly want to probe bitcoin for vulnerabilities before making a big play.  Spending 100BTC in transaction fees over a couple days might be worth it if my plans were big enough.  Luckily bitcoin has been extremely resilient and we've learned a lot about what happens when we're consistently pushed beyond what 1MB blocks can handle.  We much less to worry about than previously thought.

Are you suggesting miners not pick up any transactions at all because it risks their block being swooped up by another miner before they verify it?
There's obviously a risk/reward equation behind all this.  My understanding is that miners usually include transactions based on its ratio of fee to size.  The fee for a transaction has to cover the additional time risk required to verify that additional transaction.  My point in my original comment is that the individual fees are likely a lot higher than the risk represented by including each additional transaction - all the way up to 1MB in transactions.  
I'm not sure why some miners have that 750KB soft limit but at least on days like today, I suspect it is not in their best financial interest.  I think they're just too lazy to change it.

@_date: 2015-07-07 18:08:32
Check it out though - the 30K transactions in the mempool only have about .5BTC combined fees - that is very indicative of only the low/no fee spam from the last 24 hours been stuck in there.  Anybody with a normal fee attached to a transaction should have no problem getting confirmations pretty quickly.  The spam will be dropped from the mempool after 72 hours I believe, but for now it's not really causing any harm.

Miners prioritize which transactions to include based on the ratio between fee and size.  They want high fee, small size transactions.  They also prioritize large BTC transactions, but I'm not sure how that is balanced.
Basically, the miners are already fairly smart about how they choose which transactions to include.  If you look at the mempool right now, there are still over 30K transactions, but the total fees is quite small (&lt;.5BTC) so that indicates most of those transactions are the spam with low/no fees from the last 24 hours. 
As long as you're not sending a low or no fee transaction right now, you should be fine and be included in a block relatively quickly.  Bitcoin is working quite well given what the last 24 hours have been like.

Bitcoin has performed brilliantly over the last 48 hours.  Currently it only requires a fee of .00228BTC to have your transaction included in the next block.  .00077BTC if you don't mind waiting 3 blocks.
Everybody including myself was so worried about what would happen during a stress test like this but it's shown us only that we have very little to worry about.  Is it still a good idea to increase the max block size somewhat?  Probably, but it's not nearly the dire situation we all had been fearing.

It'd be no big deal if all wallets implemented a floating fee that adjusted to a level that would make it likely for your transaction to be included in the next block, but to my knowledge none of them really do that yet.  So during these dumb stress tests you end up with situations where people have their transactions stuck in the mempool for hours and hours because they didn't know that a stress test was going on.

And the spammer would have to spend increasing amounts of money to sustain an attack.  Yesterday in another of my posts I calculated that a spammer would have to be spending north of $1M per day to spam the system enough to drive up the required transaction fee to a  still mere .01BTC.  They would also have to be buying a couple thousand BTC per day on the open market to fund their attack as well.  That would push up the price, making their attack ever more expensive.

Sounds crazy, but there is a non-zero chance of it actually happening.  
Back when I got interested in Bitcoin in March 2013, I put pretty small odds on BTC ever taking off.  Maybe 1/100, but the potential payoff was so big and the technology so interesting that it was clearly worth a small investment.  Nearly 2.5 years later now, I still think BTC has a relatively small chance of making it big, but that 1/100 is now more like 1/10 in my mind.  I proceed with cautious enthusiasm.

That situation is possible, but wouldn't 50% of the miners have to hope that they could get at least double the fees out of regular users making transactions during their attack?

Until yesterday I would have agreed.  Like a lot of other people I was really worried about what would happen when we were constantly forced against that 1MB wall.  But the last 24+ hours have shown us that we really don't have much to fear.  Bitcoin is working as well as ever with a 30MB mempool.  There are only minor differences right now - one being that fees are marginally higher (still really cheap), and two being whoever has been spamming transactions has contributed a lot of extra BTC towards miners.  
Another thing I want to point out is that a spammer would need to continuously be spamming the network with higher and higher transaction fees to keep up the attack.  If the spammer currently has thousands of transactions with a .00001 transaction fee stuck in the mempool, they'd need to spam new transactions with fees higher than .00001 for any any difference to be made in terms of what fee is likely to get your transaction included in the next block.  A spammer has two options - keep your attack cheap and flood the network with no/low fee transactions that never verify and that dont disrupt the other users much, or waste an exponentially growing amount of money to drive the required transaction fee by others up to moderate levels (probably still quite a bit less than $1) for a relatively short &lt;3 day period.
@_date: 2015-07-07 22:38:48

Overall, bitcoin has worked far better than expected for the last 6 years.  This has been with a block size limit larger than has been needed on average to handle anybody who wants to use the bitcoin network.  Are you suggesting making the block limit lower than is needed on average to handle anybody who wants to use the bitcoin network?  Do you have any tests or data to support this being a good idea?
@_date: 2015-07-08 19:54:27

I'm not aware of all the arguments, but one would be that you would not want an attacker to spam millions of transactions with zero fees that grow the mempool to a size so large that it starts crashing clients.  I'm pretty sure most wallets aren't designed to gracefully handle mempool sizes bigger than the amount of RAM available.

It's a solid spot to hide out if you're trying to lay low.  Smaller population island - low profile tourists to blend in with - decent enough internet - enough amenities and shops to be comfortable - easy to jet south on a boat to even more remote smaller islands Koh Mak and Koh Kut if you need to - easy to keep an eye on who is coming to the island (one ferry route) - also probably easy to pay a local to boat you over to the cambodian coast if you really need to escape.

Miners want to make money.  They have an economic incentive to make decisions that will increase their income.  This could be done by increasing the block size to accommodate more transactions and more transaction fees, or it can be done by any action that increases the price of bitcoin itself.  They're not going to vote for bigger or unlimited blocks if they think it will hurt the price of bitcoin.

If 10% of the mining hashpower originally switched to the forked chain, it'd take about 10 weeks for the difficulty to slow down to the point where blocks were being found at a normal rate again.  And that's assuming no hashpower gave up during those 10 weeks.

Hmm, so let's imagine segwit and 0.13.1 never gets 95%, then 0.14.1 rolls along (say next June) and Schnorr signatures have a lot of support.  Enough so that holdouts from 0.13.1 are willing to go to 0.14.1 because they consider Schnorr signatures important enough to overcome any hesitations they had about segwit. 
 
I imagine that even in the unlikely case that segwit is not activated, future versions like that could push support over the tipping point.  On the flip side though, I think the Core devs would have to be very mindful of future versions if segwit never gets activated.  They wouldn't want future versions like 0.14.1+ to continuously lack support for a softfork because then there would start to be this buildup of unactivated code that would have a harder and harder time building support for.

Had a friend who is known to make rather poor financial decisions buy 10 BTC around the start of 2013 for maybe $30 each.  That alone did not convince to buy any, but it did put bitcoin back on my radar (after previously reading about it in 2010 and dismissing it as something that had no value).  A couple months later during the gox bubble I did get convinced to mine though, when another friend started telling me he was making more than $5/day just mining with his existing GPU.  I had a very mining-capable 5870 at the time so I started mining.  Quickly upgraded to a 7970 and had mined a few bitcoins by august, at which time GPU mining was becoming futile.

Be realistic - how many miners do you think are doing so over a measly DSL line?  Bandwidth is also very cheap over most of the world now.  With the exception of large mining operations, the vast majority of individual miners are probably not paying for internet solely to run a node either.  Do you think they are? I think they're largely people like myself who use their node computer &amp; internet access for normal everyday activities.

@_date: 2015-03-05 19:18:41
Fewer new coins being mined means less supply.  Given equal demand, price will go up.
Practically speaking, think about miners.  Let's say a miner mines a block of 25 coins and he has to sell 20 of those coins to cover his cost.  That's 20 coins of downward selling pressure.  Next summer that same miner might have more efficient hardware, and he has to sell 10 of his 12.5 mined coins to cover cost.  Suddenly the downward selling pressure is cut in half.  But let's say the miner does not get more efficient hardware and it still costs him 20 coins to mine a block.  If the block size is 12.5, it's uneconomical for him to continue mining so he drops out of the mining pool and doesn't contribute any downward selling pressure at all.  We saw this happen during the last halving.  Difficulty dropped a bit because mining became uneconomical for some miners.  Price also went up (quite a lot) but its hard to attribute just how much of the price increase was due to the halving vs other factors.

I'm noticing the topic of the great halving starting to come up a little more often now.  But the final US Marshall's auction is still the next big event on the horizon, and now we have a date for it.  There will likely be other big events before the halving - maybe a resolution/compromise to the block size debate, and maybe/hopefully the winklevoss' ETF finally launching.  But expect to hear more and more talk of the great halving in the months ahead.  I'm expecting it to be a huge bullish driver next year, and I expect that in turn to spark lots of new mainstream media attention with retarded clickbait headlines like "Bitcoin up 100% in the last 12 months, while stocks remain flat:  Is bitcoin the best investment of all time?".   But I think any attention is good attention and I think it might spark the next big wave of adoption, especially if we have simple and more traditional avenues for new people to enter the bitcoin space (like the wink ETF)

Agreed.  Last halving saw a good run-up in price (although some part of it was due to Mt. Gox chicanery) and I expect the same to happen next year.  People will be anticipating it though so I expect the price-run will start several months before the actual halving.  
I'm also of the opinion that it might start as soon as the gov't auctions are out of the way, as the 2016 halving will be the next big thing on the horizon.

Anybody with a little programming knowledge can write a spider and web scraper to gather a bunch of text.  Clif High probably does much.  A decent data scientist can use that text to do some natural language processing and show some interesting trends.  Clif High may or may not do this - he won't talk about how his program works (RED FLAG).  But he probably is doing something, whether or not it is based on any sound NLP algorithms is unknown.  But here's where Clif High critically fails....he makes predictions on output from his blackbox program.  Even predictions made based on proper NLP analysis need to be falsifiable, recorded, and ideally shown to be statistically correct more often than they should be.  Clif High does none of this.  He's been making predictions based on his silly webbot program for years (look for his old youtube videos for hilarious examples of how he's both mentally unhinged and wildly incorrect in his predictions nearly *all* the time).  Clif High is merely making a very large number of wild predictions of varying specificity, and people are latching on to the few that are ostensibly correct.  He's taking advantage of events like the halving that have the potential to dramatically change the price of BTC to make these recent big predictions.
Everything about this guy screams fraud.

math works out.  30x price explosion for bitcoin confirmed

But the on-ramps to actual Bitcoin are a lot steeper than an ETF like COIN would be.  That makes me think COIN could potentially trade at a big premium.  Kind of like how BTC-e is almost always lower than other exchanges.  It's easier (and perceived safer) on other exchanges to deposit money, thus the steeper on-ramp using BTC-e

Anybody else getting excited that this is the 2nd to last auction and only 44K more coins will be auctioned in the final auction after this?  Nobody wants to be buying with negative events on the horizon.  I feel like these auctions are viewed as future events that will act as a drag on the BTC/USD exchange rate.  Once they're over I feel like that drag will have lifted, and then there may be some lunar-activity.
Not to mention that with the auctions behind us, the next big confirmed event in the bitcoin world will be the second halving next year - something that is also seen as a positive driver for the exchange rate.

There seems to be a pretty firm floor vaguely around $200.  It seems to be a big psychological level where people start to think "ok bitcoin is cheap enough now for me to buy some" and that keeps the price from ever sliding much lower.

Human brains are exceptional at finding patterns in noise.

Sure, any reason why COIN couldn't do the same thing though?  I'd find it really annoying if COIN launched and then started trading at an insane premium while actual Bitcoin stayed much lower.  I own Bitcoin, not a derivative.

I think it's more accurate to say he's not fond of some members of bitcoin core.  Because he disagrees with some of their choices, he antagonizes them with poorly thought out statements and actions.  I don't think he's a good CEO.

bullllllshit.  Watch his videos on youtube.  His old prediction videos based on this same bullshit web bot program of his are chock full of almost entirely incorrect predictions.   Clif High is a quack.  If you can't see this you're blind.  When you have a million imbeciles making predictions, it's easy to find a handful that are correct more than not based solely on luck.  Same applies with one person making a million predictions.  Some will be correct by pure chance.  The fact that so many of you are getting duped by this charlatan is hurting my brain.  It's just so pathetic.  You really have to be a slow witted moron to take this guy seriously.

I don't want to mislead anybody so I'll say right upfront that I'm a big fan of the ideas behind ethereum.  However,  I think a lot of the reason ETH grew as big as it did was from late-to-the-party bitcoiners who wanted another shot at easy riches.  I think they're still clinging to that hope despite the trouble.  
@_date: 2016-07-14 18:30:01
Ideally.  The liquidity should be there for COIN (unlike GBTC) so hopefully that arbitrage would happen. But that only happens if people decide they should be priced similarly.  People can be irrational and decide that COIN should be priced higher for whatever reason.

Plus the *years* this thing has already been in the pipeline
@_date: 2016-07-26 18:20:43
honestly at this point I hope ETH is broken for good.  I love the idea of ethereum, but I think it has fractured beyond the point of no return.  Hopefully the good ideas can be resurrected either in a new coin or in bitcoin - but only after careful consideration and planning.  We've all learned a lot from ETH, let's just make sure we learn from the mistakes.
@_date: 2016-07-14 17:37:25
What if we get some nonsense where the COIN reflects a bitcoin value of like $10K, but the actual price of bitcoin is only like $2K.  Could that happen?  GBTC is out of whack like that to a lesser extent.
