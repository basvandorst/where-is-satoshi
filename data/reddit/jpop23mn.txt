Care to explain to an outsider?

Y'all have a ton issues for supposedly being so secure.

Wasn't outrage I found it funny

I just stumbled on this by searching top this hour. I have very limited knowledge of Bitcoin and have never been to a bitcoin website. If my first introduction was that I would avoid it like the plague and tell others too as well.

Holy shit. This sub has $1.5MM?! How the fuck did you raise so much and give it over to the mods?

Why did so many people think this would increase the price immediately? 
@_date: 2016-07-09 21:19:45
But the supply for people looking to buy isn't coming just from the miners. Those who already own that are selling make up a much big supply correct? 
If every miner sold immediately it would only be a difference of 1800 bitcoins available from yesterday to today

I never said anything about the value dropping.  I said isn't there something you could be doing with these instead of just sitting on them. If using bit coins drops their value how could it be a currency?

A couple questions from someone who knows very little about this.  Isn't hoarding bit coins one of the biggest issues the currency is facing?  Wouldn't it be better for you to convert a bit ( no pun intended) of your coins into cash regularly too help the system keep working? Is there nothing better you can do with your "wealth" to help develope the currency now if your not worried about getting rich?

Shouldn't be about finding ways too make bitcoin more accesible?  Why not use some of his money to start an online store that deals only in bitcoin?  Why not use that money for third works outreach so that they can actually use them in the future?
