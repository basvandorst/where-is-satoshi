Not sure what the big fuss is "at least one direct deposit a month of $250" as I don't really see where the problem is in here.. anybody working even the worst low paid job should be able to meet this condition.. but then here in UK every bank offer a free bank account without any silly restriction.. I can come to bank and chat to whoever is behind the till and withdraw cash etc.. still free.. paper bank statements, free.. etc

It happened to me with barclays but not for buying bitcoins, just some computer parts for higher amount from a shop for the first time.. they just did not like the transaction and just plainly cancelled it.. I called them and they confirmed it was just a security measure and it happens sometimes.. I had to create a new order and this one went thru ok, but because of this it was delayed by like 4-5 days :/
no problems with buying from coinbase so far.. last transation for 2500 GBP went tru without problems just a few weeks ago, but I am using their credit card from barclaycard for this.. but even sending money directly on bitbargain.co.uk was without problems so far
@_date: 2017-12-03 10:49:15
just take out all your savings and put it in bitcoin already.. the more you wait the more you will regret it later... I know what I am talking about... I don't have any savings in my bank account anymore... if only I would did it last year tho and not this year...
but anyway.. even 0.02 is better than 0 btc... you can always add more later

Buying regularly is a good thing.. buy buying regularly when the price is right is even better.. that's why having setup some kind of automatic buy every week is not very efficient.. because if you would spend some extra time you could get more coins out of the same amount of money...

The problem with changelly is they don't warn you ahead of the transaction that you will need to provide this, this and this.. it's AFTER you send them your coins they will put it on hold and you are being held hostage.

Currently it's not possible to buy everything with bitcoins... so it's quite natural people are cashing out when they want to buy that something... in the future bitcoin will be more and more supported so you might not have to cash out. I am just storing all my money in bitcoin as banks interest suck and my money would only devalue there year by year by inflation... so bitcoin it is for all savings for me.

This is what happens when you encourage people to store their earned bitcoins on your website/wallet instead of just sending it to their external wallet asap... after they made this change where people were encouraged to store their mining rewards on nicehash website until they accumulate higher amount to save money on transaction fees they were literally asking for attention from not so nice people.... I hope they recover but also learn and don't store btc unnecessarily for people. (unless this was all planned /conspiracy theories)

Bitcoin can be taken down.. all you have to do is delete every single copy of the blockchain in existence and switch off the internet.. or electricity.. other than that, you are out of luck.. unless you can stop people from running their nodes and miners mining the new blocks.. developers can also increase supply as well, but they can't force the network to run their code.. so this would result in a split and we would have 'bcash  with unlimited supply and then the rest of us would still play by the current rules and have bitcoin as it is. And yes, I downvoted you because your post smells like trolling...

Every bank here offers basic account that cost you nothing.. you get a debit card.. cc (if u get approved for one) all for 0 a month.. bank withdrawal is also free in any bank atm.. not just your banks atms.. they do offer premium accounts with a bunch of insurance bundled together but that's optional as well as you can find a paid atms, but these are usually in some small shops etc and you get a warning that this atm would charge you beforehand.
Btw: HSBC is not that bad.. they offered cheapest transfers to europe for several years now.. for just 4-8 pounds while other banks like barclays wanted to charge me £20 to send money to europe bank.. Of course now we have revolut so they are irrelevant

That's like the end game you are talking about.. but on the way there exchanges sure does help.  
Also if banks would simply open you a crypto account and offer some insurance against hacking I am sure lots of people would still use it.. instead of keeping their live savings on piece of paper or a stick at home

I am from UK and I used to buy on  or coinbase using a cc. I stopped buying bitcoin when the price started going through the roof last year... instead I started buying GPUs and started mining.. I mined ZEC and then exchanged to BTC... even tho I stopped exchanging to BTC when the price (ZEC to BTC) dipped a lot... instead I just kept ZEC instead.. also exchanged some BTC to ZEC when it was at its lowest.. now with zcash exploding and bitcoin dipped it looks like I can soon exchange all my accumulated ZEC back to BTC soon for almost twice as much coins :-)

This whole worldwide verification shit is total madness.. they are treating everybody like the you are guilty and have to prove you are innocent.. I wonder how we ended in here.. this should not be happening, nobody should withhold your funds or coins because they are suspicious where you suddenly got that 6 digit amount.. unless they have proof you stole them from somewhere you should not be forced to verify anything and they should pay interest if they don't release it in timely manner.. this apply to every exchange as well...

Well, the price will go up with time.. ultimately you will want to use your money for something, or you will die and somebody else will use them (if they can find your private keys) ..but the point is, holding is only good if you manage to spend them before your death.

Don't buy from bitmain tho.. that's like pouring gas into a fire xD
@_date: 2017-08-19 19:51:24
People need to shift their old way of thinking... This is based on decades of being used to the idea that money stored in the bank are safe. You don't have to do it anymore with crypto.. you can keep your money under your control 100% of the time and they will be more sacured than storing them on an exchange or anywhere else where you don't control the private keys. Of course if you want to give your money to somebody, nobody can stop you.. It's your money after all.. just don't complain when something happens to them.
@_date: 2017-08-17 17:52:15

Not a legal advice, but you can't force a business to support every fork that will split off btc... It's just plain crazy that people think they are somehow automatically entitled to their altcoins while holding coins on somebody else wallets... just move your coins to a wallet where you hold private keys and it will be YOUR decision what's gonna happen with those coins.. if you don't hold private keys.. it's simply not your decision....

Really? It was really that simple? O.M.G. why I was paying all that fees until now? o_o ...I did not even know I have a GDAX account lol... why is there no network fee but coinbase goes bananas with the fee? I don't understand.... but yes I managed to withdraw entire amount of BTC I bought.. :o no fee.. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 18:53:18
Also 1x $1000 when btc is 3000 will be cheaper to buy today than buying every day $1 and watching btc going up day by day... you will eventually end up with less btc than when you buy today the amount you wish to invest in total (considering you have that money right now).
@_date: 2018-10-31 04:17:27
I find it a bit strange that in 2 years of running they still don't accept bitcoin or other crypto as an option. One would think that they would be on the forefront of crypto payments as it's only been a question of when they will be getting banned from everywhere... yet, they worry about 'normies' might not understand crypto.
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:16:32
They could make an honest informative post about upcoming fork with 2 different scaling ideas.. explain a bit of each, maybe even mention which of them they will support and let people decide. Trying to deceive people that 2x fork will be THE bitcoin is seriously fraudulent behaviour... and it says a lot about their own confidence in 2x is pretty low if they have to push misinformation like that... It's alsmost like they believe 2x will fail miserably if they don't do something... which will most likely be the case as with bitcoin cash.

The biggest mistake is that you did not do the exchange in smaller increments.. like 0.5 BTC at the time.. or even smaller.. 0.2, then 0.5 etc.. and check your cash after every transaction is complete...
Also why didn't you report it to the police? They must have cameras in that hotel.. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 00:38:37
You can't stop anybody from forking their own little altcoin off bitcoin.. so why spend time and effort to stop something you have no control whatsoever about. If somebody decide they want 2x go forward you can't stop it.
Some people here are very negative about these things happening, but I instead see mostly positive things in it.. if people will be happy with their new 2x hard fork, good for them.. if I can get some free btc in the process... even better for me. If people will stop obstructing progress of bitcoin as a result.. amazing! I honestly don't see where your issue is.. bitcoin can't be stopped as long as majority stands behind it. No matter how many altcoins gets created in the process. I welcome any crash that's about to happen as a great opportunity to buy as I have trust in btc and believe it will recover in no time...
@_date: 2017-08-11 03:18:50

I mean if the person given the coin will not claim it and the original owner did not make a copy of the private key the coins will effectively be lost.. so I was wondering if he kept a copy of private keys and claim his coins back if they are not claimed by people given these coins.

I hate every single wallet provider who does not offer customisable network fee.. that's why I run core full node as I can choose my own fee that's based on circumstances if I need the coins to be available asap or I can wait a few days...
Breadwallet is as bad as coinbase in this.. Jaxx offer some customization (slow/normal/fast) which is better than nothing.. but really just why not give me a full control about the fee? I know what I am doing.. -_- ... we need a mobile/online wallet where I can choose the fee! Somebody.. make one :)

There is no good reason to STORE your coins on somebody else wallet.. because you don't own those coins... and that's the whole point of bitcoin, to be your own bank. Why leave your coins on somebody else wallet? Do they pay you interest by doing so? Of course he could keep them there for trading etc.. but he already replied he stored them in the vault.

Also just look how many people store their coins on Coinbase. There certainly is an market for this type of business.
@_date: 2018-06-13 22:00:45
Ok, I can see you are running out of arguments now.. like I said, just because you don't like it, does not means you can stop it. All those 'sheeple' how you called them are happy to pay a fee to buy and store their coins on somebody platform... you don't have to like it, but somebody else will seize the opportunity to do business around it.. and if they show they are secure enough not to be hacked, they will have their customers.. why not? Don't be so negative... bank can be one of those peers as well as anybody else like I and you can be. Coinbase is pretty much a bank for crypto already.. as any other exchange is.
@_date: 2017-08-14 10:34:32
It really depends how much you wanna buy.. if you are fine with some small amounts or to use your credit card to buy coinbase is working just fine.. I would not however send them any higher amount tho... (like some people with 200k etc...)

I will give you one example, imagine somebody assault you and will see you have a HW wallet on your keys.. he can force you to give him the pin so he will not kill you.. or if sobody will loot your house and find that 24 word phrase you have hidden between your socks drawer.. so the bank holding your coins is not always a bad thing.. there are always less technical people who will take advantage of this. Adoption will be driven by this like never before as well.. You can try to starve the bank out of business or you can just let them join in. Banks will eventually become exchanges like coinbase.. it's only matter of time when
@_date: 2017-08-04 05:42:47
that should be easy.. just restore the wallet from one of the many backups that you surely have on other drives... right? Online backups? Don't tell me you had 17 BTC stored on a wallet that your only copy was on that drive.... that would be very stupid.  
Anyway.. there are some data recovery services you can try... google some and send them a link to the pics and you will see if they can do something with it... It won't be cheap tho.
@_date: 2017-08-18 08:24:36
their instructions are for segwit2x, but their title only mention segwit activation and 2x is not mentioned anywhere in their article.. that pretty much on par with misleading... 
btw they amended their article and added a segwit2x paragraph at the bottom when I checked their blog today.. still they try to tell everybody just because 95% miners agreed with 2x that this is gonna be the main chain.. they obviously are still misleading as it's not up to miners but users what miners are gonna mine.. unless all 95% want to be hugely unprofitable...

This what I would do if I was a bank.. there will always be people who will feel more comfortable if somebody else holding their money for various reasons... and it's not all bad, you can still hold them on your paper wallet if you want. This is a good step imho and eventually all banks will transform this way... or will be out of business.. It's like when telecom providers at first blocking skype etc.. and not just offering unlimited minutes and text and pretty much became ISPs and selling data plans..

@_date: 2018-06-13 21:45:59
I think you are just being very stubborn right now.. Ok I will put it this way: You can't stop banks to open crypto accounts for anybody who wants to have one with their bank.. and I am sure they will have their share of customers.. it might not be for you or me, but they will have their market share... my mom for example could open a bitcoin account without needing to understand any of the technicality of it and worrying she might have her coins stolen. 
@_date: 2018-06-17 12:10:48
If you don't want to use coinbase I bought coins from   
You buy directly from other people.. I used to pay by sending money to other UK bank accounts and coins were released withing 2-3 minutes since I clicked payment sent.. you need to verify tho

I would guess that you just need to leave the bread wallet open and let it fully sync.. this can take some time... but once fully synced you should see your transaction there
@_date: 2018-06-12 22:08:24
Pretty lame excuse imho.. you buy 1000 of bitcoin.. you own your bank 1000.. it does not matter if you only have 800 one hour later.. you still have to pay back 1000 next month, so that is pretty lame excuse to stop using cc to buy crypto.
@_date: 2018-06-07 18:22:51

All my buys were pretty much instant.. either paying with bank transfer and person released coins withing 2-3 minutes of payment sent.. or when I used coinbase I paid with cc and coins were mine pretty instantly.. then sent to gdax and withdraw to my wallet without any fee... 
@_date: 2018-06-03 19:01:20

I used cc on coinbase all the time in the past... buy with cc, pay it back next month.. I don't see any problem with that.. no interest charged. It's the same as if I paid with bank transfer, but that would take like a week or two to send and receive the money by them and with cc it was instant!
@_date: 2018-06-18 10:50:44
Well, the coins are still there.. with over 700 confirmations now.
If that address belongs to the bread wallet and seed you use I would try to completely delete bread from the phone, reinstall, activate wallet and let it sync without allowing the phone to go to sleep.
I had similar problem where my balance did now want to show up, but after I resynced from scratch, which took well over 30 minutes the balance finally updated. 
Other that that, if there is any other wallet that is compatible with bread seed phrase you could try to import your seed into that wallet and see if you get any results this way...
You could also try to contact bread people on twitter, they might respond to you...

Problem is not the transfer fee, but the hidden conversion fee.. because banks would have to convert GBP to EUR and then back to GBP... so instead of getting the todays rate of 1.1 for each GBP bank would only exchange at rate 1.05.. and then again back to gbp.. so I lose more money with every transfer with just conversion.... Coinbase need an UK bank account!

It leads me to think that the whole bcash fork is there only to help b2x takeover... like I bet just before the november fork there will be some sudden pump of bch + that silly EDA nonesense times for the fork window..  to give miners more incentive to move away from bitcoin while b2x will attempt to attack bitcoin.... it's all futile tho, I won't be accepting b2x as bitcoin no matter what happens.. even coinbase can rename it if their wants, who cares.. there are and will be another bitcoin exchanges

I think you might need to rethink your boyfriend relationship when you have to hide $150 from him... 
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:22:39
You will get the coins even on ledger.. and then you can split them and send only the s2x to an exchange.. much better than sending your coins to an exchange.. the only advantage could be you will be able to sell quicker if your coins are already on exchange since the network might be slow.. 
@_date: 2019-02-19 07:04:28
I think the problem here is that why do you even try to hide your own money from your boyfriend? If it is your money, it's fully up to you how do you spend them and you don't even need to inform your boyfriend... unless he is your husband, in which case he should be at least told how you are spending your money which are also his money...

He is not going to it.. nobody would... it's stupid
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:52:32
I would still not risk it and just kept coins in my own wallet that you can use to split the coins.. it sounds like coinbase would be convenient way to quickly split your coins, but remember, anything happens... they are not your coins while in coinbase wallet....

@_date: 2017-11-21 05:29:38
Interested in this as well.. as coinbase is pretty useless as they don't even have a bank account in UK which would make transfer instant and in GBP... now you have to use their estonia EURO account which would cost your even more on double conversion from GBP to EUR and than back to GBP... 
bitbargain.co.uk could be good as they use UK bank accounts.. but this might be more suitable for somebody who is loaded with btc aka are selling on regular basis..
So how people sell btc in UK?

In 9 years bitcoin went from $0 to $7500+ and every time I wanted to buy more and resisted it turned out to be a huge mistake just a couple of weeks/months later... so now I am pretty much all in with my savings and it was the best decision I've made.. only regretting not buying in sooner..
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:47:31
If you have a UK bank account you can use bitbargain.co.uk everything you buy it's instant.. and you can buy large amounts as well... 
With coinbase I would have to send my money abroad first.. wait a few days for them to arrive before I would be able to use them... very annoying

Keep it in a wallet you fully control.. you can split your coins yourself.. there are several methods how to do it... I personally would not trust any exchange in doing this for me.. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:18:16
your fault buddy. they warned you to withdraw your coins if you want bcash right after the fork... you did not and now its up to them if and when u get it

@_date: 2017-11-05 23:50:35
You will have the option to select on which chain you want to view your account... so if you select s2x you will see your newly airdropped fork right there.. I am not sure how the splitting will be handled, if it's going to be automatic or you will need to confirm some popup splitting before you will be able to send your coins somewhere without risking your btc to dissapear as well.
@_date: 2017-11-23 07:30:22

80k sounds about right... +- your 15k ;)
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:33:55
1. hard to say, it really depends what the result of the 2x fork will be.. if btc survives I would expect the price to go up, if 2x will take over btc or btc will struggle for long time it could start losing value...
2. now seems better.. so you get free airdrop of s2x coins ;)
3. before fork just check  and see for yourself.. decide on appropriate fees based on that graph. after the fork.. hard to say... depends on how much hash power will mine btc.
@_date: 2017-11-25 10:43:51
I wanted to buy 5 of them as well.. but the idea that I have to pay now and wait 4+ months for them to arrive was not the best... that 1 BTC I would spend today might be worth a lot more in 4 months
@_date: 2017-11-05 10:48:57
If bitcoin can't resist somebody forking it couple of times than there is no hope in bitcoin at all and it should fail.. you can't rely on people not forking bitcoin for it to be valuable and secure store of value.

@_date: 2017-11-15 13:27:22
well.. the exchanges are not responsible for supporting every single bitcoin fork that occur... so if people let their money on one and the fork happens it's their fault for not moving their fund to a wallet under their control. I don't really agree with bitmex decision, but on the other side I would never leave my coins on an exchange during a fork anyway... so at least people get some free btc, even tho they can't decide when to sell those bcash
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:15:49

They could surely improve their resolving time tho..

there is not a good option for UK to send money through bank.. as they would convert to EUR and back to GBP costing me more likely  more than their fees on cc

Would not just paying the mortgage and keep the bitcoin be a lot more profitable in the long run? Especially at the rate we are growing right now...

All I am saying is that bitcoin is either resilient to this kind of attacks and will survive naturally or all hope is lost as anybody can fork it.. and if coordinated in large scale attacks you can have many forks at the same time.... 2x is the best test imho, if we survive this, we survive any other fork no prob..

What I don't understand with banks is why they just don't treat crypto as another currency like euro, yen or pound... just make bitcoin available like all of those.. open account for customers and hold their coins for them... many less technical people would love to have bitcoin account with their bank.. people would get their address to directly deposit bitcoins to their bank.. or just send usd to bitcoin... it would be like the bank become an exchange as well... would be win win for the bank... they could hold crypto for people.. there is many of those who store their coins in coinbase.. so why not utilize this market??
I seriously wonder how long before first bank will support this...
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:25:07
Sadly no.. I was looking forward to get my cc limit doubled again after 500 but nope... 500 is the max. even when the coinbase will show you 'wait xx days to increase the limit' once you hit 500 it won't go up anymore.. dunno why? They could earn more on fees.. instead I had to use bitbargain.co.uk where I could buy several tousands of pounds worth of bitcoins instantly.. and all those fees could go to coinbase instead...

You buy bitcoin on an exchange.. not a possibe forked altcoins.... exchange might not even be aware that somebody somewhere forked their own altcoin... and it would be very hard to prove as exchange might not gain anything if they don't support that fork.. that means nobody have access to these coins simply because you can't force them to integrate the new forked altcoin... would be interesting to see but I think any claim would fail in the end unless they could prove that the exchange stole their new altcoins instead of completely ignoring/not supporting the fork in any way

Yes they do charge quite a bit of fees, but if I would like to setup and send them money from my bank account it would have to be converted to from GBP to EUR as their bank they use only have EUR account and then once they receive that payment they will convert it back to GBP for me.. that's 2 conversion with a rate nobody mentions anywhere.. my bank would give me a shitty rate and then their bank would probably give even sittier rate for convertion and who knows maybe coinbase would convert it with even worse rate.. so all in all.. not worth sending cash over bank transfer from UK... not to mention I would have to wait days before my funds would arrive.. with CC it's instant and within a minute I have my coins withdrawn from coinbase

Depends where you are...
If you are in UK, you could use bitbargain.co.uk registering is easy, verification takes a day or 2.. and you just deposit your money to your UK bank account and buy from somebody on the site with instant bank transfer to receive your btc in about 2-3 minutes after marking your payment as sent... you can buy large amounts very easily (I personally bought about 1-2 BTC without any issues) ..fees are about the same compared to coinbase +-

Hey, Killerko still Hodling?
I have seen an old comment of yours talking about auto trading bitcoin, well now is the right moment to seize this with the bull run coming out.. right, right, RIGHT?
Just make sure to avoid manual trading. Wall-street &amp; bank traders win, regular people lose.. why? because they use automated algos, not mouse clicks.
They use auto-trading tools exactly like this: 
Wallstreet sharks and bank traders only trade with HFT algorithms, computers that make decisions, not humans. That's why all manual traders lose in the end, they can't keep up with robots' computing powers!
I personally, had a good strategy that made me lose -$30K on MT4 brokers! and with the same strategy tweaked into a robot I am now making +$17K profits a month on autopilot.
I.E. Here's a decent Crypto auto-trader pros use 
Good luck and stay green.

Why do you keep the coins on coinbase if you are not trading them? That does not make any sense.. I understand why traders have to take the risk, to be able to trade.. but if you are just buying, transfer to your own wallet asap... I never had any crypto balance on coinbase for more than a day. I always transfer everything out to my own wallets.

This would be a lot better if every other pixel from the original QR code would be put on the other layer.. even better if you would randomize it a little bit.. like sometimes you take 2 pixes next to each other then leave 2 on the original layer etc.. then do this for all lines.

It's called evolution, without it we would be still stuck in the stone age and nobody would even dare to get the idea to melt bronze to make that fancy new axe because it would not align with their ancestors whitepaper how the stone axe should look like..   
Bitcoin will evolve beyond its original idea that in 10 or 20 years might not match it's whitepaper by much... and it will be good, same like we evolved from morse code to analogue telephone to digital to wireless.. it is still sending 0 and 1 in the end, but a lot more efficiently than having a 100 slaves processing morse code in your basement so you can get your messages faster.

Because bcash cheated and changed the way how difficulty is adjusted when they forked. If they would not do this, their fork coin would not survive.. because the drop in hash rate would be too much and cause them to be stuck for long time before their difficulty would adjust to their new lower hash rate.. so they made something called emergency difficulty adjustment. This caused that they mined blocks a lot faster because when the difficulty was low, all miners even some btc ones jumped on it and mined blocks a lot faster then in 10 minutes intervals.. so while their chain was longer then btc, they also broke the bitcoin rules.. so they are no longer bitcoin and therefore not competing with it.

I personally think that when you reduce the amount of running nodes only to few big corporations, even when your argument that they would not do anything stupid to undermine the value of bitcoin would hold true, there is still the issue with securing the network as it would be a lot easier for governments or other interested to stop or take over the bitcoin to eventually do so when they only need to handle several companies across the world instead of several thousands individuals nodes... so you are sacrificing network security with reducing decentralization. When decentralization is gone, that will be the end of bitcoin...

That's not enough. It's ok for simplicity to have 2 options, but there should always be that custom option. For example I was attempting to consolidate some of my coins during the time when mempool was full and fees were crazy and I did not mind waiting for confirmation a few days since it was only sending coins from one of my wallet to another wallet of mine. Yet this wallet asked me to pay very high fee with no option whatsoever at that time. I stopped using the wallet shortly after. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 04:11:46

somebody need to write a detailed tutorial how to SAFELY split the coins without replay protection... 
@_date: 2017-10-24 20:53:42
..so, how?
@_date: 2017-10-27 16:02:30
Grow and bet is quite different tho.. 50% chance of loosing all your savings instantly is not risky, its stupid. Bitcoin is a lot more stable than this...
@_date: 2017-10-11 01:05:35
I would wait for a dip.. price is at all time high or very very close... then bought with $200
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:38:19
How about if I make a couple of extra wallets pre-fork.. and will try send btc to one of these new wallets after the fork.. if there is any replay attack the b2x coins should still arrive to the same wallet but on the b2x chain.. this way you could try as many times as you would like to split your coins without the fear of losing them... or am I missing something here?
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:35:16
If you buy more than you can afford to lose (or won't be able to repay) then you should never be given credit card by your bank... so when you already have one, let's assume you are a responsible spender... therefore it should be irrelevant if you are doing some home improvements for 10k or buying 10k of Doge... because you are spending only what you will be able to repay no matter if doge will crash to -0.00001
@_date: 2017-10-14 10:55:24
4000? what happened with 400?
@_date: 2017-09-13 09:37:10
You can encrypt and backup the wallet.dat to other places like usb keys, another hard drives or cloud storage.. that's how even if your house will burn down you will still be able to recover your wallet.

@_date: 2017-10-09 21:12:33
this seems very similar like with bcash.. people will be dumping like crazy and prize will plummet in hours.. unless somebody will be buying them just to keep keep the price above... hmm

How can people who don't know how to code achieve anything on the coding side?

@_date: 2017-10-18 22:28:20
What's the point? If I would really want to spend my bitcoins I would just sell and send fiat to my bank account and spend with my visa card.. pretty much the same thing, right?
This is just for fun... to have a wallet address printed on a bitcoin themed visa card :-)

What would you do if BTC would crashed badly afterwards? Did you have any backup plan? Would you be able to keep up with repayments with your normal wage? 
I have like 85+% of my savings in bitcoin.. but I would probably not risk it with debt to buy bitcoin as that could ruin my credit rating if I would be unable to keep the repayments for any reason... 
@_date: 2017-10-16 00:22:30
I can totally do this.. sell them my coins for several millions then let them crash the market, buy more cheap coins and let it repeat again in a few years.. no problem with that ;-)
@_date: 2017-09-19 11:15:26
If you need to wait for a paycheck to buy bitcoin you are most likely doing it wrong.. I would never touch my day to day money or my "reserve buffer" to buy bitcoin.. these are for my peace of mind so I can live without stressing too much what would happen if the next paycheck will not arrive... 
I only use my savings money to buy btc (extra money I don't need for day to day use).. so I can buy anytime I want and still have plenty left to pay that unexpected bill or holiday or whatever can pop up without touching my savings...

Who are you to tell anybody that they cannot waste their 10k+ credit card on crypto?
I worked hard to get 5 digit credit limit... I have excelent credit score.. I can use this credit for what-ever purpose I want.. no matter how stupid or risky it is.. and the reason they said 'to protect customers' is total bs.. they are just afraid of the dip and that everybody will buy it... fortunately I don't have any account with them... 
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:13:26
I read they rules about uploaded files and surprisingly I did not break any of the rules expect not displaying money or currency.. which could be questionable here.. but we will see.. they will reply in 24 hours.
@_date: 2017-10-25 03:25:40
A day? You mean an hour max.. and then it will skyrocket as everybody will buy like crazy lol
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:53:16
They already have many practices in place how to filter irresponsible people from having a credit card.. if your credit score is low or non-existent you will get small credit limit to start with.. and as you prove you can manage your credit responsibly they will keep increasing it over the years... so I find it a bit insulting if they suddenly try to tell me I cannot buy crypto becuse they are worried about me not be able to pay it back?!?! What a bunch of bs is that.. I was able to pay back everything I ever borrowed from my bank... this is total nonsense imho

I DON'T KNOW? Since you.. um, don't know?
@_date: 2017-10-15 15:18:04
not really.. by spending middle man add fees that cost you more than using fiat directly.. and again when re-buying you pay fees to exchange of choice.. so overall you lost, final merchant probably got the exact same amount as it would get if you would just use fiat and two 3rd party middlemans gained their profits... is this really worth it?
@_date: 2017-10-18 20:57:43
Why? It would be cool if they would approve it... but something is telling me it will be rejected...
@_date: 2017-10-03 23:17:35

I think that's pretty clear from their previous actions...

They would have to close at the very same time as I would be in the middle of buying more coins... and I am very quick to withdraw everything right after buy so I don't care what happens to them 2 minutes after as I got my coins out

@_date: 2017-10-27 22:20:17
Even then to call something "grow" you need to have higher chance of winning than losing... betting on red have a chance of winning less than 50% therefore you are going to lose all your money eventually...

@_date: 2017-10-18 19:10:36
Yeah, this is pretty silly.. instead of sending bitcoin directly to somebody you wish to buy something from you convert to fiat and use master card to pay that somebody... we can do better that this and ditch the master card middle man.
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:09:46
still.. could not people just transfer fiat to coinbase first (wait 3-5 days for fiat to arrive) and then buy instantly?

buy more nanos and split your coins.. print a couple of paper wallets and store some coins in there.. etc.. I also like to alter the backup seeds and all my passwords/pins/keys that I for whatever reason have to write down so that if somebody will find it it will not work for them but for me it's kind of obvious what modification I did.. for example if I use 1 in all my passwords when I write it down I replace 1 with 9 which I would never use in a password.. this way it's obvious for me right away.. but not for anybody else.. similar if my last seed word would end with word 'rib' I would instead write down 'ribbon' ..I try to be consistent with the changes I do so I don't have to remember specifically the change itself just the system I used to generate this alteration... and of course I don't go crazy with it.. I still have to remember it even a year later :)

Is there any advantage for storage at all?
@_date: 2017-10-23 00:22:47
haha.. I remember when I wanted to buy some altcoins just for fun.. so I bought about £120 of doge but after a couple of days the price started to go downwards slowly and btc started to rise so I quickly reconsidered and got rid of those doge for btc only losing like £10... 
When I look at what is doge worth today I am glad I sold quickly as it just hit rock bottom in just a couple of months after that.... so no more altcoins unless they are already worth almost nothing.. (like the doge is now.. Im thinking about buying some again lol)
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:32:21
on internet it's pretty safe assumption
@_date: 2017-10-17 20:02:09
instant cc buy is pretty awesome... you click and got coins within seconds... I wish they would increase their cc limit tho
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:17:36
Yes that's the negative for cc I don't like.. It seems I can't increase it more than £500... but then again if I want to buy more in a week I just use bitbargain.co.uk and I can do instant bank transfer and buy however much I want
@_date: 2017-10-19 11:23:51

I think this is pretty stupid idea.. It reminds me the posts from people who put all of their weekly wages to bitcoin and at the end of the month they have to cash out because they need to pay rent.. stupid! I don't I want to change my life so drastically or risk my everyday life standard.. Instead I moved like 85% of my savings to bitcoin and keep my life as is... keep some money out of it just in case if bitcoin goes to 0 than well.. fuck it, I lost my savings, but I can still live the life exactly as before.. I just won't be able to buy that mansion and park that tesla in there.. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 14:59:52

Wallet is free.. just install on of from bitcoin.org or run a full node (it has a wallet as well), but you will have to pay for every transaction if you want it to be confirmed in a reasonable time... it does not have to be much (I sent a few btc here and there and only paid like £0.05 in fees and it all went through ok.. but I had to wait a bit)

@_date: 2018-07-08 22:10:06
That seems as crazy as when coinbase or any other exchange block your account after you deposit bitcoin with suspicious history (came from hacking etc.) ..they will question you where did you get those coins etc..
I would just go to other bank and ask for mortgage there.

You will get S2X coins no matter if you store your BTC in legacy or segwit addresses.. just don't forget to split your coins before you send them to an address that you don't have under your control (like an exchange etc.)

@_date: 2017-10-13 03:58:50
Did people really buy bitcoin on coinbase this way? I mean to wait 3-5 days is RIDICULOUS! I've only used instant credit card payment and always got credited bitcoins right away.. any other way would be totally unacceptable for me... hmm
@_date: 2017-10-06 00:17:40
if you have UK bank account bitbargain is clear winner as they offer instant transactions with no limits once you are verified...
on Coinbase you can also buy instantly with a credit card but their limits are horrible and it takes months and months to increase them... I can currently buy 500 GBP of instant bitcoin a week with credit card.. :/ to be doubled in a day or two I believe.. then wait another 3 months for another increase
@_date: 2018-07-13 16:15:57
This is how you create new altcoin... miners can just keep mining the old chain (what else could they do anyway) and the only question is if the new pow chain can get enough support from users and exchanges to still call it bitcoin.. 
@_date: 2017-10-07 14:47:39
You can withdraw all your coins from coinbase through gdax for free.. (yes, no network fee deduction on your side, every single satoshi you bought will end up in your wallet of choice) So there really is no excuse why leave them with coinbase.
@_date: 2017-10-09 14:43:06
not gonna happen.. but I would surely welcome it so I can buy more just before the fork xD
@_date: 2017-10-01 13:04:49
I use bitbargain.co.uk/buy
you pretty much buy directly from a seller and can pay with instant bank transfer for UK.. fees are similar like on coinbase tho.. but you can buy pretty much any amount the sellers are selling.. and it's instant (within minutes)
@_date: 2018-07-26 12:03:15

They could bill you per episode/movie up to the maximum of the monthly fee... this way if you don't watch anything you don't pay.. if you watch too much you only pay the monthly fee no more... it's a good system.

If the value goes up by 1000 times of it's current value then yes, your 1 mBTC will be worth what 1 BTC is today. In other words, 1 mBTC is just 0.001 BTC.

Most merchants accepting bitcoin don't really get bitcoins after all.. they probably use some 3rd party payment processor who accept bitcoin for them and send them fiat instead... so by spending your bitcoin you only feed the middleman with fees and then you have to spend another fees again re-buying...

If this is just a one time help and depend on your credit rating I would just go and open a 0% interest for xx months credit card for the amount you need and done~ you saved your btc.. pay back a little bit every month which should be affordable, unless your dad wants a new tesla or something.. you might even find a 0% fee deal and in that case it would cost you nothing... In case you need cash, some banks offer a transfer of your credit to your bank account.. but this is usually not free and cost a one time fee.

Why should developers/creators of the coin abandon their original name just because they decided to do a hard fork and somebody does not agree with them?

You should probably stop watching CNN... or any other fake news :-) wikileaks is a publishing organization and you have to be blind to not see why is this happening.. democrats are butthurt they lost election because wikileaks exposed their blatant corruption so they try and do everything they can to attack wikileaks.. meanwhile it is them who are breaking law everywhere where you look... So if coinbase gave in to this influence they are the same corrupt bunch without any spine that would not hesitate to do this kind of things in the future... if you think this is ok then feel free to use coinbase and support this, but i won't!

I doubt they will ban it again.. but who knows... also  is suspended.. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 18:01:35
well..  
1, spending cash or cc does not cost you as spender anything, while bitcoin, you have to pay your own transaction fee...  
2, Then there is that whole protection issue, if you won't receive what you paid for you can just call your bank or paypal and they will sort it out. With bitcoin you will depend on the other side if they are willing to refund, but if no.. you are out of luck.
3, also getting bitcoin is not free.. there are fees on exchanges to pay which are not small
So there are still good uses for cash, cc and the like...
@_date: 2018-04-01 18:40:14
I bought quite a lot of btc just last year on my credit card.. you are just stubborn to see other people perspective.. in my case buying on cc was a lot more convenient than other ways.. yet I always paid my cc next month in full.. so using a cc is not something I see as bad.. I use cc a lot

Yes, as long as their (original developers) fork survives they have the right to keep the name.. that means it was not rejected by wider consensus... the coin would have to die for somebody to claim the name and carry on the original chain..

Spending for the sake of spending is not economical... there are fees for the spender to pay at every corner.. there are transaction fees, there are exchange fees.. using cash, debit or credit card is a lot better decision economically to buy you than thing you want than spend and rebuy...

This is something I've never understood.. why are people buying BTC with money they need for rent, bills, food etc.. I have bought a lot of btc last year.. I put pretty much all my savings in there, I also bought on credit card etc.. but I've never used my money that I would need for paying any essential bill or any other existential thing... I can't even imagine I would put my last 2000 or something in bitcoin and then 2 weeks later looking for a way how to quickly withdraw 200 because electric bill just came in... How can you live like that.

It's because it does not make much sense for them to pay you in btc unless they already have a stash of btc already... it cost not small fees to exchange to bitcoin.. so either you or they would have to pay that fee.. which does not make sense financially... just exchange it yourself.

no.. you can't do anything with revolut bitcoin as it's not even on a blockchain.. it's not even bitcoin imho... all you can do with that thing they sell you is just sell it again on revolut.. and maybe send to other revolut user.... but unless they allow withdrawal/receiving to/from btc wallets, I would not even call that bitcoin.. as clearly it's not...   
I was kinda excited about revolut crypto.. but being hugely disappointed how they implemented it is an understatement...

Like I said.. it depends.

You still don't get it.. eh? Even if BTC would crashed to 0 after December nothing bad would happen to be.. I would not become bankrupt..

If you are responsible, using a CC (or any other loan/credit) does not have to be seen as bad.. I know what I am doing.. and I don't live from wage to wage... I also never sold any btc yet.. I only buy

thats why I am kinda hesitant to use any of these kind of exchanges.. the only one I kind of trusted so far is the bitbargain.co.uk where you trade directly with the person who is buying/selling bitcoin.. the site only provide tools to do it.. it is more expensive then others but so far no issues

Reasonable would be to activate segwit and see how it goes before making any big decisions as block size increase.. and not just hastily agree on 2mb hf without even seeing if there is a need for it...  (we most likely won't need 2mb hf for some time after segwit)

Long term investment.. Like a saving account... but with better "interest". I slowly move part of my savings from bank to bitcoin... Could be used later on for anything from mortgage or as a retirement fund.. I believe btc will be worth a lot more in the future than the current $3000.. so it makes sense to move part of my fiat money (especially the savings that just sit in a bank and don't move). Currently I am nearing 20% of my savings being in BTC.

Ok, so again you see things in my reply that I never said.. I did not ask for an exchange of his BTC for my possible BCC... I only asked if I can have his BTC... the same way he asked me if he can have something off me completely for free based only on that I stated that it doesn't looks good for the incoming BCC...  
If it survives and there will be demand for it.. good, at least I will have somebody who will buy them off me.. but if not.. does not matter to me at all.. no loss either. I still believe from how things are going BCC won't hold value for very long if at all... I don't wish them anything bad.. anybody can fork off bitcoin their own altcoin.. but piggybacking on btc value is not something easily done without significant support.. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 20:36:28
So how does it works? You send 1 BTC to viabtc, you get both 1 BCC and 1 BTC... You sell 1 BCC and get 2 BTC? Which will be frozen until the fork is over? Seems too good to be true... 
@_date: 2017-07-27 11:50:33
it looks more and more that BCC will be dead on arrival...

how hard is it to just send the balance to your own wallet?

Since when are social networks responsible for their users actions? If the same standard would be applied to fb, twitter, reddit and others, there would be no social networks today.. but no, you can live stream a murder on fb and nobody bans them.. but one person on gab shoot somebody and they go all ape shit and shut them down without any due process etc.. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 00:27:53
I wonder how long before somebody will make a fully decentralized twitter like network based on blockchain.. with no censorship, no deletion of your 'tweets'.. once you post it, it will be there forever as long as a copy of blockchain will exist somewhere.. Gab is not interested in this, as truly decentralized network they would not be able to monetize it.. it would also cause lots of issues for them as a company as doxing, cp and other issues that come with decentralized networks like blockchain.

I will stick with core.. I never understood why they want to upgrade to 2mb blocks asap after segwit activates.. it does not make sense.. It would be more wise to see what happens after segwit is activated and decide if any further block increase is needed right away... which I think might not be needed for some time.. So, no.. I'm sticking with core as they seems a lot more reasonable...
@_date: 2017-06-23 21:42:29
If people won't use them that will not help them much.. I for sure know if I would want to buy I would go somewhere where they sell what I want.. and that means not segwit2x hf.. if there is a lot of us the exchanges will think twice what chain they will support... I can still dump the hf coins on one of those tho and buy more core :) ...we will see what happens. I personally think there will be no HF unless it would get huge support from everybody.. and this is not going to happen without core....

nice.. how can I make one?
@_date: 2018-12-20 07:25:48
try green address: greenaddress.it/en/ 
the only thing that I did not like on this wallet is that they ask you to create an account and basically log in to your wallet, but pretty much all functionality are there including the ability to set your own fee.

I'm running my little bip148 supporting full node and that's about all I can do for it.. if there is anything else I could do just let me know :)
@_date: 2018-12-20 01:32:03
Haha, that sounded like it's from 2018 :-)
@_date: 2018-12-10 03:44:23
Who could resist such a cheap btc?
@_date: 2018-12-03 21:29:58
the burger is round... kind of orange colour.. and start with the letter B for bitcoin... it all makes sense!

not another post about bitpay.. -.- please, stop using and promoting them.

They kept doing this from 2013.. how much money they possibly made with all those funds in those years? Even tho they returned most of the funds now + interest, if they would not be caught they would keep them.. 
They should still be fined a lot more to prevent any of this fraud from happening again. The other banks can now see that it would only cost them around 30 mil in fines but they could have 150 mil available for 5 years to do whatever they want with.. 
Btw I don't believe that they did not now what was happening from the start.. quite the opposite I would say, but might be hard to prove.

They should be fined significantly more than the amount of funds they failed to transfer. This way, they will just do it again because it's profitable.

tell him to send you bitcoin then.. no £... I would accept crypto...

I only opened this thread to make this comment.. but it is already here...

Where did I mention "even exchange" in my reply? I just randomly asked a stranger if I can have his BTC coins.  
I still don't get your logic... how me saying that BCC is DOA entitle a random stranger to be gifted all of my potential BCC's.
Some people sure are strange with their logic here...

That does not have to be true every time.. I for example used to buy btc with my credit card.. also buy on credit other stuff but still have money I can afford to buy it with right away.. but prefer credit offers with 0% interest etc..
@_date: 2017-06-10 00:22:45
Tried that, even went a step ahead of your suggestion and restarted the whole pc :) and it's still stuck like that and hours behind increasing instead of decreasing... It has around 30 active connections to other nodes... I'm running out of ideas.. other than deleting the whole blockchain and syncing it again which is really like the last option  
Also the % of progress is not lower than on the picture.. now it shows 99.76% and is still stuck on the 00:29:00 time stamp
@_date: 2017-06-16 21:22:36
Is there any safe way how to dump the non-148 coins for bip148 without using any 3rd party? I just don't trust any of the exchanges enough to send them my btc...
@_date: 2018-12-04 00:38:50
@_date: 2017-06-05 04:40:29
Honestly.. I would be happy if they would just accept paypal... but I don't think that will happen anytime soon (if ever)
@_date: 2018-12-20 01:34:42
Fist.. You should never, EVER use Bitpay for anything EVER. No exception!
There is no second.
@_date: 2019-05-27 08:08:57
Somebody decided to sell 
@_date: 2018-12-22 22:07:10
hmm, I have full book of solved sudokus.. where can I get some of the stuff for them?

it's crashing slowly in hopes that coinbase won't notice and stay online xD
@_date: 2017-06-10 03:23:07
Ok no prob.. rebuilding the whole thing, will see in a few hours (days?) and yes there is loads of space on that drive...
