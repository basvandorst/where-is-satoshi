I don't know if this is an appropriate proposition, but there's a Russian political activist and opposition leader, [Alexei Navalny]( who regularly critisizes Vladimir Putin's authoritarian rule and exposes corruption of his inner circle.
He is running a campaign to participate in presidential election in 2018, and seems to be the only candidate who is not a Putin's puppet. Of course, Navalny and his team face threats, intimidation, fabricated court cases and even physical violence. [You can read more about it here](
He's [officially accepting donations in Bitcoin]( for his campaign (БИТКОИН is Bitcoin in Russian). The receiving address is 3MQTRzttkMtsMEy9dRq4Sf1xiSsWKgQkyH
If Navalny wins, or even gets enough publicity, Russia may yet have a chance of democratic changes after all this years. This will benefit not only Russians, but the whole world.
