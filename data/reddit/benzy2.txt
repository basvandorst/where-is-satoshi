Realistically, if all you’re doing is buying, $1 now is better than $11k.  It’s always buy low sell high.  If you fear “high”never comes back then it’s an issue but if the current goal is to accumulate, a low price wins.  Since nobody knows the future, seeing a price drop is typically scary that it won’t bounce back.  But if you’re looking long term these crashes just allow you to accumulate more.  Seeing it drop to $1, buying $10k worth, then having it go to $1000 is a better deal than buying $10k worth at $10k and watching it go to $20k.  Up isn’t always the best profit, though it sure seems safer.

That’s the problem I see with BTC.  It does what it was meant to do well.  But it doesn’t do everything well.  So many articles make it sound like it’s the replacement debit card for every day life but that’s not true and it’s not close to being true.  It may eventually reach that but it’s not close to being used to buy every cup of coffee in your day to day life.  And that’s ok.  We can have a handful of properly developed options that specialize in different areas.  
I don’t go to the ATM to withdraw enough for a new car, I don’t write a check for a pack of gum, and I don’t use a debit card to pay the kid down the street to work in my yard.  As long as Bitcoin does something great, and a few other things well it can afford to do yet others poorly and be successful.  There will be room for more than one crypto currency without meaning they all (or all but one) is a failure.

You did say that.  You said: 
“A $100k degree is never a good investment as depending on what the degree is in you can almost certainly get one cheaper without losing many, if any, benefits.”
That’s saying a $100k degree could be had for less.  Literally your argument.  You used the word cheaper which is ironically a term to mean for less money.
My argument is that from high school educated to finished with your degree that will allow you to earn money can cost $100k from public school.  The OP didn’t say $100k Bachelors or Associates.  It said $100k for a piece of paper from a University.  To go from no college education to licensable or certified in a masters/doctorate program can easily run into the $100k mark from a relatively inexpensive public school.  Graduate rates can easily be $25k+ a year on top of the  $40k you spent in undergrad.  It’s not cheap but it’s as cheap as graduate level rates get.  You can’t just start at the doctorate level.  You have to pay to get there too. 
I was always talking about Masters or Doctorate programs.  You know the ones where from start to finish cost $100k to the public school of your choice?  It’s not a new part of this debate.  The fact you are just now understanding the argument shows you haven’t followed along at all.
The waste of your time was when you started in on me and had no ducking clue what was going on.

I’m not saying getting a drama degree for $100k is valuable.  I’m saying degrees that start near $100k are typically worth far more.   If you’re dumb enough to spend $100k on a $20k degree I can’t help you.  But those degrees that typically require $100k in cost are worth it.  I’m not sure what degrees you see people spend $100k on frequently but I doubt it’s the BS you’re taking.

NYU’s annual rate is $49,000.  Thats not average for private schools.  The average annual public school rate is just under $10,000 per year and the average private school annual rate is just under $35,000.  That’s the AVERAGE public and private school rate.  Please for fucks sake don’t try to argue that one of the most expensive schools in the country is the average.  You are cherry picking or you’re just stupid as shit.  These are easily verified stats.  (Here is the average rate info  )
So no, I’m not talking about degrees specifically from one school only.  I’m saying that the average public BS program tuition rate is around $40,000.  Most students go to public schools.  To get to $100,000 in tuition for the average student (which the average is attending public school) you’ve gone well beyond a BS degree and are into a specialized masters or doctorate program when you hit $100,000.  The average rate is not NYU at $49,000+ a year for entry level classes.  That’s an outlier.  Stop being stupid.
I’m not arguing that it’s smart to go to NYU to get a business degree vs going somewhere far cheaper.  I’m saying if you go to most public schools (which most people attending college are) and spent $100,000 you are into a masters or doctorate program.  My point from the beginning has been that spending $100,000 at a public school isn’t spending it simply on a BS program.  It’s getting you more education than that.  And that’s not something you can do much cheaper by going to a different public school.  You can compare high priced private schools to cheap public schools and act like the majority are going to NYU priced schools but that’s far from the average or median.  Most are already going to in state public schools.

Really?  Go read how this went. I said that my $100k degree was a good use of money and has paid off.  You replied that it’s “never a good investment” and suggested that most $100k degrees could be had for significantly less.  I said that’s not true and then you went on about the cost of private school.  I never said a fucking word about private school.  I’m saying the majority of $100,000 degrees are from a public school and gave the person a masters or a doctorate to refute your argument that most all $100,000 degrees can be had for far less.  My point is that most people getting expensive degrees aren’t getting them from private school and aren’t able to get them from a different public school for half price as you imply.  
The entire point of this is that the OP was mocking people who would spend $100,000 on a degree.  I get that if it’s a bland degree that could be had for $20,000-$25,000 but it’s also such a stupid thing to say when the majority of masters and doctorate programs are from public schools and tack up those numbers.  It misses that a huge portion of expensive degrees aren’t overpaying at private schools but instead of advancing education at public schools.

Don’t be stupid (maybe you should have paid more for a better degree).  I’m not arguing going to a private school or top priced public school makes sense.  Most of those kids have families with funds that make those numbers seem meaningless or scholarships cut the price to reasonable. 
I’m saying and have been that most $100k degrees from most public schools are worth while.  You make the case yourself.  Tuition is fairly fixed.  A BS cost what it costs, and at most public schools its not $100k.  The average annual tuition cost for a BS is just under $10,000 for public schools as of 2018.  That’s nowhere near $100k/degree.  By the time you get tuition costs to $100k for the average public school, you’re well into a masters if not a doctorate.  Unless you’re throwing room and board and alcohol and any other stupid shit kids piss money away on during school.
You can try to cherry pick the most expensive vs the least expensive schools and make it look like the average is spending $50k per year (which is well over the average private school cost of just under $35k) but that’s not the reality for the typical student.  The masses go to public schools and either add lots of other costs into their loans to reach $100k or they are getting advanced degrees.
My point again, to be clear, is that a $100k degree from an average public school is worth its cost for most who pursue it and it’s not easily found for half the price.
I’m not suggesting people without the funds spend the luxury on a private school.  If that’s your point of view, that most people are spending $50k a year for basic degrees I don’t agree and I also don’t think going in debt for that makes any sense.

I’m not trying to argue over who is right and who is wrong, but you’re hypocritical in that you are doing everything in your interest the same that you claim CB is doing or will do.
The only good thing I can say for CB is that most all of us at one time or another used them or an exchange like them to convert Fiat to crypto or to convert one crypto to another.  Only a small chunk can honestly say every transaction they’ve done has been without using a service such as CB.  And most of those exchange transactions were early on when we had no idea what we were doing.  I’m not for CB but I am for the people they get in the door and hooked.

Is this a real question?
They can bomb use by heavy criminal penalties for anything involving it.  That may not work in a failing country like Venezuela but in a thriving environment where the masses aren’t ready to riot it’s much more effective.  
In a physical sense they bomb the largest mining farms, they hack nodes, and they set their own farms/node to attack the integrity.  Imagine if say the 5 largest crypto governments confiscated all mining locations and nodes.  It would control Bitcoin.  As long as there are physical assets controlling Bitcoin, the governments can physically attack them.  Sure they are wide spread but the vast majority of physical assets are in a small number of countries.
They could also buy up all the crypto and effectively control the supply.  If they owned 15,000,000 Bitcoin they could effectively control supply and inflation for hundreds of years.
I think Bitcoin will be long lasting but never mainstream.  It will be the currency for failing nations as we saw in Venezuela.  But prospering places have no reason to adopt.  The pain isn’t real and it isn’t significant.

My points have all been last option kill it at all cost scenarios.  The much more likely and shorter term choice is to tax crypto highly.  Add additional tax to every transaction.  Force businesses to document their wallets so that transaction history can be traced.  And from that require purchaser info kept so you can link individual transactions/wallet IDs to the purchasers.  Do this for a few years and you’ll know who owns what.  Then start coming after people when you want.  If businesses don’t comply it starts with minor fines and penalties and ramps up to criminal charges.

Ok fair enough.  They don’t only care about today but they do care far more about today than tomorrow.  It’s a misstatement to say they care nothing about the future but it is reality that they will do things very harmful toward tomorrow in attempts to save money today.  Just look how many of these companies have cut hours, cut benefit paying positions in favor for 10-20 hour per week slots.  They are doing far more that damages the future to save today than they are the opposite.

It all depends how hard they want to crack down.  If USB sticks become primary tools of terrorism they will be banned from travel overnight.  How many things have the TSA banned that are in vast circulation?  No reason to think it couldn’t extend to something else.  In the US we all have to take our shoes off now because of 1 failed event.  And you think those same rule makers won’t kill everything in their path to keep power?  There is zero chance they go peacefully while a non government controlled currency takes over.
Killing access to the account is close enough to killing the account.  It ends short term account usage when traveling.  Which is pretty significant.  Add in making crypto ownership a crime and now it’s like taking an illegal weapon through security.  They don’t have to access the coins to put you in jail.  They just have to know you possess illegal items.
Just think larger scale and more corrupt.  If you control one of the largest, most powerful nations in the world, you’ll do everything possible to sustain that.  No government will allow crypto to take over.  It only thrives when the government has lost power and control of the citizens.  Short of that, they’ll eradicate any threats to their way of life.
I like crypto and I like Bitcoin, but I’m not naive to the fact the government does some extreme stuff to stay the power they are.  I don’t see a way that a replacement currency happens against government will short of the people revolting against their government.  And I don’t think any major developed country is close to that scenario.

Well the reality is the stores listed are ending Visa transactions.  So the company is willing to take the fallout of not accepting Visa.  The question of LN is separate from the question of will they accept dropping Visa (which has been answered).  The real question is if there is benefit for Kroger to implement LN now.  I’d guess no.  The amount of IT they’ed spend to integrate it into all of their stores and have it run smoothly seems far far higher than the small amount that would process through LN.  It’s not like a single family owned store when the account goes to one simple wallet that isn’t a problem.  This is 200+ stores with 10-20 PoS access points per store...all needing to integrate with the current software.  I find the likelihood of them adopting this or any crypto as very small.  At best it’s would be a posture to push Visa but even then I can’t see it holding weight.  Maybe in the future but it’s not worth the cost today.

How will you use your crypto?  This isn’t like drugs where you can get high from them and are the end user.  You need someone to transact with at some point or it does nothing.  If there is no one to transact with, what do you have?  It’s certainly not a currency and it’s not a store of value.
If every transaction requires personal info attached to a wallet address (IE the government allows crypto but requires ID with use) how long do you think you can use crypto before they know what you have and who you are?  Some may bypass that and break the rules, transacting without ID but it’s an easily traceable system.  It will no longer be a semi-anonymous currency, at least to governments, when businesses are forced to keep records.

That’s false logic.  That would be like saying only 12 people can crack the tumbler of the safe, but more may be able to find semi-destructive ways to enter as well.  Others may find ways to drill key components or pry in certain vulnerable points so that the least number to be able to penetrate the safe is 12 (through the tumbler) but it may end up far higher.  You can’t assume perfection from one device and then assume the other will show real world flaws.  
All security does is buy you time.  It will never be a permanent stop to unauthorized access.  The question becomes how much time, effort/knowledge, and resources will be required to gain that access.  A hidden item that remains hidden is just as secure as a safe that remains unopened.  You have to determine how much security you need and what provides that.  
From a practical, residential point of view, obscurity is far more secure than affordable safes.  Short of spending $5,000-$10,000 and properly anchoring the safe, all you’re buying is either fire protection or protection from mostly innocent people.  Budget safes take just a few minutes for even semi-competent individuals to bypass.  Add in better portable tools and it’s even uglier for the home owner to actually secure items in a known location.  Even the good residential safes can be opened in under an hour (most under half that) by skilled thieves.  On the other hand, hidden items, especially well hidden ones, take much longer to locate, even if only taking seconds to access when location happens.  Just google what it takes to get into a $500-$1000 “safe” and it will be painfully obvious how little security they actually provide.  A seed key placed in a wall during construction will take exponentially longer for a criminal to find than for a criminal to get through even advanced home safes.

My problem is what is the point of a coin/blockchain when you already have the funds in an account and you control all the nodes?  The beauty of blockchain is when the public control the nodes and the idea of a fast moving coin also makes no sense when it’s all internal movement.  The only way this makes sense is if it’s designed to replace Bitcoin external from JPM accounts, at which point why would anyone trust them over a CC or cash?  Maybe I’m just ignorant to their goals but a singular bank controlled coin doesn’t seem to do anything different than the current banking system.

There isn’t a direct need for Bitcoin.  There is a direct need for a decentralized currency that is quick and easy to process.  Right now Bitcoin is the leader.  Doesn’t mean it always will be.  As long as there is civil unrest, areas of high fear of the government, extreme inflation, etc a currency not affected by those influences will be valued.  I don’t know that Bitcoin has to be the one, but there does have to be one.  If we lived in a perfect world with perfect trust and no dishonesty, there would be no need.  But that’s not where we live.  I think Bitcoin has the best chance because it seems fairly well designed (with some flaws) and has the largest market share/market confidence of all the coins that are truly decentralized.   But many businesses/ideas come and go as times change.

Let’s start with your own idea.  Let’s assume a government wanted to move to Bitcoin as the national currency because it’s the only game.  How could they alter the supply?  If they are ready to trash their currency for Bitcoin, how could the alter the circulated supply?
Or a government who wants to kill Bitcoin in their country?  How could they alter the supply available to its citizens?  Any laws or regulations you can picture?
What about a hacker set on killing a coin.  What could they do to cut supply?  How about all the coins sitting in wallets from known theft that are essentially blacklisted?  What have they done to supply?
What about whales looking to move in or out of a given coin/currency/stock?  What could they do to alter the landscape to adjust supply and with that price?
You look at supply as the number of coins mined and how that will be finite.  And it is an exact, non adjustable amount.  But that has nothing to do with what’s available for circulation which is the true supply.   I’m not going to spoon feed you.  It’s time to use your own brain and logic this through.  These forces have been around for as long as money has existed.  To think Bitcoin will fix the system doesn’t give enough credit to how strong those in charge of the system will fight to stay in charge.

Short term its probably bad timing.  Odds are we will see a chunk of this last gain fall away shortly.  But if past history is to show a trend we will be far above where we are at now in a few years so all purchases in the short term will be better than waiting a few years.  Or it could all tank.  Don’t know, but I’m betting that it still has a ways up to go until my retirement date so I’m holding out good or bad.

I agree that you have a choice and it’s a fee you agree to when you open the account, but once that account is open that money that’s earmarked is no longer yours.  You may get some back of the few goes down and you may lose more if the fee goes but, but it’s not yours if it’s earmarked for closing costs.  If you can’t spend it and can’t take it back, it’s not yours.

I don’t think that’s real.  For people in environments that aren’t in active economic collapse, the masses don’t care.  Look how many people can’t explain what bitcoin is or how the absolute most basics of it work.  And you expect them to do their own research and become interested when they already show zero interest?  They will only care if there is easy money to be made or if there is a ton of pain in the current system.  When neither of those exists, the masses simply don’t care.
@_date: 2019-04-05 00:49:18
I don’t think I was complaining?  I think you might have me mixed up with the guy that was a bit rude about all this.
The earmarked money isn’t yours anymore just like fees to transact aren’t yours.  I’m not upset with fees and I’m not upset with LN earmarking money.  Fees are a necessary part of transactions.  I just don’t see that as your money if it’s spent already as an insurance/closing cost.  Just like looking at your regular Bitcoin wallet is not actually what is yours to spend or what your Fiat account shows before any fees are racked on.
If you can’t spend it and you can’t withdraw it, it’s no longer yours.  But that’s not LN specific and it happens in practically every currency/exchange/investment option.  Maybe seeing it before hand makes some feel worse, but I’d rather see it up front than overestimate what I actually can spend/withdraw/exchange.
I fully agree that fees are mandatory for this stuff to work and that we don’t complain (as loud) when they happen for bitcoin transactions or for Fiat transactions (well some of us bitch about all those but you can’t please them all) at time of transaction rather than showing before transaction.  I’m not against LN or a program that displays fund as available to spend funds rather than full, pre-fee value.  I’d prefer it.

I’m not fully up to date here on LN so if I’m wrong I apologize.  I thought when it showed 230 whatever Satoshi in the account that 20 (or whatever the difference from what was put in originally) were earmarked for closing and couldn’t be spent and couldn’t be retrieved.  If the fee drops, more will add to the balance and if the fee rises more will be deducted.  If that’s not correct, I have the wrong understanding.

In your first paragraph are you talking about Apple or Android payments?  How are you planning to pay for everything you buy?  With an app on your phone linked to your crypto account?  Because that doesn’t sound any more secure than using an app on your phone linked to your bank account.  And one of those has a way to stop a thief who gains access.  I get a hardware wallet that’s offline works well for storing value, but for daily transactions that’s not going to work.

We will see.  I think the attempts they’ve used so far (at least in the US) have been feelers for what they can and can’t push to the masses.  I don’t think the government has put any serious effort into a ban or the direct lead up to one.  We will see what gets ruled as constitutional or not.  We’ve seen that not all speech is protected so even if code still classifies as speech it doesn’t mean it’s protected.  A ban is a near last ditch effort.  It’s not an effort that’s going to be something that we see for a while.  But don’t think the SCOTUS won’t stop the government from losing all control or expect that congress won’t pass an amendment.  There are plenty of ways to get around what is in place now if the pain for the government is strong enough.  We aren’t to the point where the pain is near that level.

But block size doesn’t fix anything long term.  All increasing block size does is delay the problem and centralize the nodes as fewer and fewer individuals can afford to run a node.  I’m not sure LN is the answer but blocksize doesn’t fundamentally change the problem at all. It just adjusts the date when things go to shit.  And if the goal is global adoption it will go to shit with a larger block size.  I don’t know the solution but I can see some of the problems.

First announce it is not a recognized money, then link it to all the illicit things it’s been used for, then push that its main goal is to hurt the country and its people, then call it terrorism or treasonous and ban it?

I’m not in this to promote the tech or to handle any of the burden of the system.  I get those who do but it’s not me.  I also get those who want to trade for short term profit rather than in the name of the technology and as such only care enough for a lite node.  It may not be beneficial to the community, but it’s enough for the individual.  Not everyone looks at this with interests beyond their own.  Doesn’t mean as a group here that people will enjoy that approach, but we can certainly understand it.
@_date: 2019-01-20 07:17:50
But you were arguing that volume is what makes things stable and then you say the volume was by uneducated people so it doesn’t really count as volume?  What I’m saying is that a quick change in volume made it unstable.  And it did.  You keep giving scenarios where a volume changes and stability drops.  Every case you bring up is not that this has less volume than that so the price isn’t stable.  Every case you bring up is that volume drops so stability drops.  The key is that a volume change (up or down) hurts stability.  
Just like a bubble on the rise, people saw the moon on the way up and threw in money they wouldn’t normally based on the change.  That’s not stability.  In mid 2014 to mid 2016 we saw fairly stable (for crypto) volume and prices, at a volume much lower than where it was through late 2017 to mid 2018.  The stability from 2014 to 2016 was far higher even with lower volume.  Because volume wasn’t changing.

@_date: 2019-01-20 04:45:43
Literally none of that is correct.  It is not volume that brings stability.  It’s lack of change in volume.  Volume goes up at the start of hyper inflation.  Your example says volume is stability, but the largest volume currency isn’t stable because of other stuff, so really volume there doesn’t matter much, but for us it will.  That’s insane.  
Why would one be so vulnerable to a single event regardless of volume yet another wouldn’t be vulnerable to a single (if different) event?  Large scale power loss would end bitcoin as a currency.  I don’t think that’s likely but I also don’t see the US going to hyper inflation any time soon either.  We can pick unrealistic what ifs all day but it doesn’t change reality.
@_date: 2019-01-18 06:31:32
5/3rd would take all your change, put it in a sealed deposit bag, have their daily pick up take it with all their other deposits, send it to a main sorting location, and have it in your account within 3-5 days for no fee.  And that’s talking like a 10 gallon bucket full of change. No fee.  The local bank would do the same but they had a sorting machine on location and would sort it on the spot and add it to your account instantly.
@_date: 2019-01-20 06:54:01
The only thing I agree with here is your definition of volume.  You point me to bitcoins highest volume and tell me that was its most stable time?  Even your example doesn’t talk about volume but rather a quick volume change.  Stability is linked to volume change and not volume.
@_date: 2019-01-20 07:24:42
And yet the lowest volatility doesn’t coincide with the highest volume.

@_date: 2019-01-20 03:13:49
Be we see volume doesn’t lead to stability or else we wouldn’t have all this fear in Fiat, which has high volume.  You can’t claim the answer to the problem is the problem.

Again, you say this like everyone has no issue with the cost involved.  If the option is lite mode or no node at all, then a full node is never on the table.  If you are a casual user, a full node is not on the table.  I’m not saying the hypothetical of what if is incorrect.  I’m saying no everyone is willing or able to handle the costs involved in a full node and having a lite option makes sense for those people.  It doesn’t do any of the benefits of the full node and you are 100% right about the theory of it all.  But you can have a great theory of why we all should drive Lambos and nothing but them.  Still doesn’t make it reality.

They can hold zero bitcoin, as long as they have enough of something else valuable that they can sell/trade for the replacement.  Obviously if all 21 million coins are stolen you can’t replace them but that’s so far out of context of a single exchange getting hacked it’s not funny.  Especially as mixing/washing of coins becomes more popular the tainted coins find new ways to work back into circulation and start the count of how many are available back over.
I agree that teaching people to control their keys is ideal, but there is also a good argument for a custodian who is trusted, insured, and regulated to manage the keys and minimize risk of theft on the individual’s level.  Having someone else responsible when things go wrong has it’s benefits.  You have to make sure that entity is capable and determined to fix any issues or they quickly loss all value.  Most people with Fiat don’t store it all under their bed and most who use Fiat don’t fear a theft at their local bank will lose all their funds.  There can be custodians who quickly restore funds after an attack and that is valuable.
@_date: 2019-05-04 16:20:07
Depends.  All wallets require trust.  Trust that the developer of the software hasn’t put in place back doors or hidden access.  Hardware wallets require trust that the hardware doesn’t store/transmit data outside the intended transaction just for the purpose of the transaction.
You want a wallet that allows others to check the code.  This way, if a backdoor is present, others can see and alert the community.  Down side is that if a vulnerability is there but hasn’t been exposed, it gives the code for hackers to see.
If your wallet is third party/protected source you (and the others in the community) have no idea if exploits are sitting waiting for the day to come.  This is scary, especially if say a new owner buys out the current, legitimate owner.  This goes for hardware and software wallets (as all use software to interface).
Assuming the developer is legit and can be confirmed via the community checking code, then the question is how secure is your specific environment?  Paper wallets can be very secure while not in use.  If you have a dedicated machine on a clean OS that isn’t connected to the net, then it’s pretty secure to leave crypto in a software wallet.  If you disconnect your computer from the internet and use a clean OS when you setup your paper wallet it’s pretty likely that it’s secure to hold crypto.
But when you withdraw and every time you withdraw using either a software wallet or a paper wallet you expose your keys to anyone who has access to your system.  That’s the fear.  If a malware bug or screen capture hack has silent control of your PC then it can steal your keys and your funds.  Every paper wallet I’m aware of requires use of keys through software on the device you’re using.
A hardware wallet on the other hand is designed to use the keys on the hardware, sign the transaction and transmit only the signed transaction to the pc/phone, not the keys.  The keys are stored locked and short of a highly funded (think CIA quality level) attack they are safe from sight.
So assuming the developer is legit, hardware wallets are much more secure but paper wallets on a secure machine are safe as well.  If you can’t afford to lose what you have, I’d buy a hardware wallet.  If you don’t want to lose what you have, I’d buy a hardware wallet.  If you can code, can read software to verify the legitimacy, and have very strong knowledge of OS security/detection then a paper wallet is probably ok.  I would assume if you have to ask (which includes me too) that the only safe option is a hardware wallet.
