As I really cannot quite grasp the concept and the idea of how the LN could work: How do you think this would work? If you hide the users' participation in LN from them, how much would they lock up in a channel if they bought a coffee or similar? 
Would they lock up the price for one coffee? Then you pay two transactions (opening and closing) instead of one. 
Would they lock up e.g. five times the amount of their purchase to lower the per-purchase-fee? What if they happened to be at that coffee shop for the first time and don't like the coffee there? They now have a channel with a party that they did not intend to visit more than once. 
If you lock up more than the users are willing to spend, how does it solve anything, really? When I have 1 BTC, I - as a user - would assume that I can (roughly) pay 0.4 to Alice today and 0.6 to Bob tomorrow. If you lock up more than the intended transaction this would not be possible.

So, the optimal solution for minimizing hops would be a star topology, if I'm not mistaken? This makes every other node in the network reachable through at most two steps (minimizing fees-per-transaction). This also minimized the number of necessary channels (one) for the average Joe and therefore "channel creation" fees, right?

I don't get it. What did I miss? What did coinbase do or not do?

I'm confused by what you wrote: they are and aren't spamming - like Schrödinger's spam or something?
By inefficient transactions I assume you mean SegWit and/or batch transactions, right?

So, who would I connect to in a best case scenario? And are there any fees attached to using someone's channel, if we had this scenario?


Would I have to pay for using your channel to Alice (channel 2) if I sent a transaction to Alice?

I don't have an example but I am saying that there is a real chance that transmitting value through your multisig wallet could fall under money transmission. On the other hand I also do not have an example of anyone being shut down for receiving money, wrapping it into 20 different envelopes and passing it to the receiver but I guess that may also very well be perceived as transmitting money. 
I think we can leave it at that, we agree to disagree. I don't have an example for a multisig wallet being shut down and you do not want to concede that under the letter of the law there is a real possibility to classify the LN network as net of money transmitters.

They burned the coins as described above. They sent it to an address to which no one has the private key.

Are you shifting the goal posts here? Your argument was _You'll be safe as long as you do not trade in fiat_ which just isn't true. As you can see, you may be classified as a money transmitter even though you do not necessarily trade in cash/fiat.

I think they most certainly will. As such they would of course have to conform to KYC / AML laws as well. And if they try to hide behind Tor, as another comment suggests, this could be detrimental to adoption, I think, as not-tech-savvy people would be required to deal with another _layer of confusion_ setting up Tor.

If [this]( is anything to go by (and still relevant) you couldn't possibly spend the BTC at a burn address, since this address used an invalid public key. 
The process for generating a burn address (link) is as follows:
1. Create an invalid public key.
2. Hash the invalid public key and generate an address.
3. Profit: Since the pubkey is invalid (not beginning with (**0x04** when uncompressed, and not beginning with **0x02** or **0x03** when compressed) and therefore undefined you can't generate a valid signature. You can't use a corresponding private key to sign a (valid) transaction, which - of course - is needed to spend your BTC.

I don't see a reason to classify changelly or shapeshift as a "Money transmitter" (as described [here]( as part of a money service business) while it can or cannot be argued for a LN hub to be exactly that. As such it would have to adhere to AML as well as other regulations. Of course I may be wrong here and I sure hope I am but in the end it will be for a judge to decide and if it turned out that LN hubs indeed are _money transmitters_ even using Tor you'd be on the brink of illegality using the LN.

Found on another KYC / AML discussion here:  In that case the guy also wasn't dealing in fiat and still he was shut down, wasn't he?

The [license]( seems to speak about Bitcoin Core.

At first I was like "nah" but then I saw you didn't forget to include Moon.

Are exchanges charging more than the minimum miner reward as a withdrawal fee also "fraud" then?

Dino run confirmed.
