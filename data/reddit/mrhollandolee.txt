Like you said, it's the same company. There's no reason to believe that GDAX won't eventually 'expire' the bitcoins they hold for you.

I wouldn't call deciding not to invest in a highly volatile market a mistake. A missed opportunity, perhaps, in hindsight, but not a mistake. I also didn't invest in Apple or Microsoft when they were still working from garages. Again, not a mistake, just a missed opportunity. For every person who makes such a 'mistake', there are thousands who lose all of their money on bets like these.

Buying high and then panic-selling low when it crashes down is a mistake. But not getting involved in the first place is never a mistake. Getting in from the ground floor is always going to be a gamble and I wouldn't call people who decided against that 'losers who made a mistake'. Being cautious is a very useful trait to have. Sure, you won't get extremely rich extremely quick, but you also don't run the risk of losing it all, because you thought that 'this is really going to take off'. 
But a one-time gamble on bitcoins when it started that paid off does not make you a trade genius. It's luck, nothing more. But if you can point me in the direction of the guy who invested in Bitcoins, Apple, Microsoft and SpaceX when they were all starting up, I'd be very grateful.
