98%. That document looks fake.

Not denial. I stayed away from Gox from the getgo. Basic research would tell one to do so. But that document is a farce made to raise the level of anxiety.

You can't "rebrand" a company that just lost $400 million dollars in fiat. That's like the nazis post WW2 rebranding themselves as preservers of life. NOTHING about that is plausible.

Not trying to drum up a conspiracy, but without confirmation, some dude in Boise, Idaho could've written that. Everyone freaking out and considering it to be real hurts the legitimacy of the bitcoin community, I think. I'm not saying it ISN'T real, I'm just saying I'm not buying it's legitimacy till there's some kind of confirmation.

Also, the picture of Karpeles is just the kicker. Just doesn't look write. I could've created better graphics in MS paint. If you're making a document about the re-branding of your multi-million dollar financial exchange, can't you do $100 of graphic work? Seems fake.

I agree with that. Wtf is the point of bitcoin if one must scribble everything on little shredded papers? If that's the best solution that can be offered, security-wise, that's pathetic.

I understand that, but I could write(little shitty graphic examples included) that entire document and circulate it in under an hour. In fact, mine would have been more believable. I know no one's awaiting Gox's confirmation, but it just doesn't look right for an internal document.

Because the document states that 740,000 were stolen. That is where that originated from. That's why.
