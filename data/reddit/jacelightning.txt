Useless for making money if including GPL code in your code. You effectively give up your rights to make money. It's like a virus that infects any code that touches it. I know you are probably anti-capitalist and don't want big companies to make money, but programmers need to get paid! It's hard to find and keep talented people if you don't pay them lots of money!

You're right: you can sell it for whatever you want. But you also **must** give it away for free. And if you're selling it for $10, someone could ask you for the source code, compile it, and then sell it for $5 and get free money basically. (But that could continue until you effectively cannot sell it for any money).
Basically that clause is a back-handed "fuck you" to people who sell GPL'd software. "Yeah, charge as much as you want! (because I'll come along and give it away for free!)."


Are their training programs open source? Can you download the handouts/videos? They aren't making money on the open-sourced software--they are making money on the closed-source training materials.


Absolutely. Contributing is fine, but if all their software was open source they wouldn't make any money.

and v3 and L'GPL. They are extremely restrictive licenses.

Free software foundation? Run by an idiot communist, Richard Stallman. Software licensed under the foundation's GPL license isn't "free." It's one of the most restricted licenses out there. Include GPL code in your code and suddenly you have to give all your software--including the source--away for free. GPL software is effectively useless.
Richard Stallman said he thinks software engineers shouldn't be paid for their work!
Fuck the Free Software Foundation.
BSD and MIT licences are truly "free." (And yes, I know Richard Stallman helped create the MIT license)

Almost no commercial software is released under it... because you can't make money off of it... and you can't hire the best programmers if you don't have money to pay them...

1) Try using Bitcoin without a Bank Account. Yes, now there are bitcoin ATMs, but try buying on Coinbase without a bank account. Can't do it. Once the money is inside PayPal, you can send it to anyone inside PayPal for free.
2) Good point. 
3) PayPal has the virtually no limits either. Verification is required for large transfers because it is mandatory under US law that large transactions are reported to the IRS. It is also mandatory that US financial companies look out for money laundering. Same rules would apply to Coinbase, et al.
4) Is that a feature or a bug? PayPal is getting better about fraud detection, but if someone hacks your account, you'll want to know where the money went and have some level of protection.
5) PayPal offers OAuth and public apis for people who want to integrate with PayPal, but not use the standard tools (
6) No fees for sending money inside PayPal (I do this all the time). Fees are only taken when using a merchant account. Credit cards charge 2.7% + 0.15 per transaction and 3.7% for entering the card's number, so PayPal charges 2.9% for online purchases and 2.75% in store to pay those fees. If PayPal didn't accept credit cards, they would only have to charge 0.2% or less.
7) Same with PayPal. Open your PayPal account, click send money to friends, and enter an email address. That's all you need. Could be a proxy email address and change every time you send money.
8) PayPal has to comply with US money laundering laws, US terrorist financing laws, and US export laws. In short, PayPal doesn't care what you spend your money on, but the US government requires them to vigilant. Same can be said for Bitcoin--Coinbase would ultimately be responsible if you were spending money building bombs.
9) Neither does the USD. But, if you want to verify your Coinbase account, you'll need to scan your driver's license, and have a proof of residence. Same with Bitstamp and MtGox (RIP). PayPal only requires your name and address, and doesn't require complex verification steps. PayPal does not sell your information to third parties, but it does offer its BML services which some people rely on to survive. 
10) This one is debatable. If you had your own wallet, and did a direct transfer, no one could stop you without blocking your internet. But if someone was out to get you (like the government), they could identify where the transactions were originating, and where they were going.
11)  How? I feel like this is the opposite of true...
12) True, though without regulatory oversight, more bitcoin disasters can happen. The reason why the US banking industry is what it is today, is that the exact same things happened right around the time of the great depression. Bank accounts are FDIC insured. MtGox was not.

Cryptography has been around for hundreds of years... It was used in WWII to encrypt messages being sent to the frontlines. 1996 is kinda late for a cryptography reference.

And is now accepting my downvote. When MO finally actually details a realistic plan, I'll believe that they are serious.

You wanted evidence:
Here's someone throwing away their money: 
Here's someone getting their bitcoin stolen from their computer (four days ago):
There's a long guide on how to do it correctly (read: complicated):
There are many many more stories of people losing their bitcoin (not on MtGox):

PayPal is legally obligated to look out for money laundering. One of the signs is a rapid increase in payment volume

I was just wondering why a site that currently offers no function, would be still up. It costs TONS of money to run a website, especially with Google authenticator API. And now *poof* it's down.

I send money to my friends all the time with PayPal using only their email address. Transfers are free 100%. PayPal only charges when it has to work with credit card companies. Credit cards charge merchants 2.7%. PayPal charges 2.9% making 0.2% off of every purchase. If credit cards were out of the picture, it would be on par with bitcoin fees.
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:59:28
But only if people pay with credit card. If you send money to a PayPal account from a PayPal account, it's free. Credit cards charge the 2.7% transaction fee, and PayPal is just passing it along to the merchants.
