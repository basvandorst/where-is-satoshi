For sure. Just don't pay 30$ for a 24 hour transaction, there's really no point anymore.

I would sell it for tree fiddy

This is likely an old sticker. Hopefully LN makes this sticker relevant again.

I've had to pay as much as x12 on a non-segwit transaction and it took almost 3 days to process, but it was during a period of high activity. Probably not a good measure.
x6 seems like a safe bet under normal circumstances.

At the very least reduce risk. Risking 30 bucks' worth of bitcoin is not the same as risking 3000.

This is why you never trust anyone else with your bitcoin. People should withdraw their money as soon as possible from exchanges and the like to a wallet where you own the key.

Your statement is facetious. Market psychology and supply/demand cycles exist everywhere, not only in tulips and bitcoin. It's obvious they are comparing the value propositions of both, and the reason the analogy is wrong is because the utility of tulips is extremely limited, [while a currency that comes integrated with its own transactional system with the characteristics he mentions is a value offering on its own]( Think how much banks and payment systems like PayPal are worth. Tell us how that is comparable to tulips.

[Is this the one you mean?](

Keep this in mind: It hasn't really *become* $500 until you sell it.

I don't know if it's just me but I'm at a point where I don't give a crap anymore. I'm leaving my BTC where it is.

Always the safest bet if you suck at trading, as I do.
