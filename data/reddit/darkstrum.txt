Sorry but you need too look elsewhere to get BTC... Virwox is out of the BTC business at least in the Americas and Paypal is out of the BTC business everywhere...  Skrill won't work either, you need to find on other source but they are all deep Know your customer, u need to take photos of yourself and send them into the website so they register you with the government
You need to find a good BTC mixer and anonymous wallet, but forget about being anonymous cashing out unless u go on dark web markets

If there is a minimum BTC to mix on wasabi, then I always use [bestmixer.io]( or their onion site [
They are solid and you can mix as little as you want if you want to try a small amount to test it
Wasabi looks promising but I need to research more to find out about how it deals with lesser amounts
Good luck

I have used [Bestmixer.io]( especially the Tor/ site and found that they are simple reliable and have great customer service and followup..  I've used it 20 times at least and never had an issue, the customer service had great response time and gave full answers.  I've been using it over a year.
I have no idea why someone would think it would be complicated, you put your BTC address where you want your mixed coins sent to and you send the coins you want to be mixed to the address give you, you get a downloadable Letter of Guarantee that spells everything out and guarantee's you get your coins...
Currently the clear website appears to be down but the Tor onion site is up and running
That said...  I never used Wasabi wallet and it looks as if there is an onion site so I'll check it out now, but if it is an actual wallet combines with a mixer, and has lots of recommendations I'll check it out, 
I did a quick research and saw someplace there are limits or differences based on how much you mix... Can you mix over 0.1 btc?  
Another good thing is there is an active onion site:
