Not entirely, although I see where your coming from. Either way, we can agree that consumer spending will decrease and is a component of aggregate demand within an economy, so effectively, it could ultimately lead to less economic growth. Demand drives supply? Assuming correct, GDP reduces. The effect is magnified in countries which are more reliant on consumer spending rather than other components such as exports for their AD, such as here in the UK (I think).
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:25:46
Is there a drop soon? How soon? Should I invest now or wait? How much?
Sorry total n00b here aha
@_date: 2017-09-03 21:02:52
What do you suggest is a comfortable amount to begin with? Regardless with what a begin with, if growth is good I should be able to clear the fees anyway right?
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:52:22
Will definitely keep that in mind when investing, solid advice. Thank you.
@_date: 2018-03-19 21:00:26
Best wishes from the moon!
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:23:51
Good point. How much do you recommend I invest solely in bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-09-03 20:32:13
How regular do you expect crashes to occur?
@_date: 2017-09-16 18:47:53
I just want my damn lambo
@_date: 2017-09-03 21:39:38
Great idea. Why coinbase specifically?
@_date: 2017-09-03 21:04:26
What about if I have literally 0 expenses? As a college student where education is free and my parents provide for me I feel I have basically nothing to lose.
@_date: 2017-09-03 21:19:14
That's the thing, the higher the starting investment the more time it will take for the first trade so I will be losing money till then. I was personally thinking like a 10th of that, or is this simply a bad idea?
@_date: 2017-09-03 21:23:52
No, I mean as in earning the money for the first investment, the higher the $ the longer to earn; delayed first investment.
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:48:52
Dude you hit the nail on the coffin. I consider myself somewhat of a stoic, so emotions are no problem. Anyways, thanks for the advice l, really apreciate it.
@_date: 2017-09-03 21:14:32
@_date: 2017-09-03 21:46:53
What exchange/platform are you buying on if you don't mind me asking? 
@_date: 2017-09-03 20:33:49
What do you personally think? It you HAD to guess?
@_date: 2017-09-03 20:44:30
Not any particular figure really, just something of note, like the one recently.
@_date: 2017-09-09 19:34:00
This is doing me a huge favour. I need to wait a month for my first investment and the market is stalling hehe 
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:39:38
Thanks for the advice! So do you also recommend I treat it almost as a S&amp;P 500 as I invest and basically leave it to hopefully grow? And should I continue to add into the investment now and then over time whenever I can?
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:24:55
Totally agree, I share the same sort of mentality just needed an outside opinion. How much do you recommend I invest in bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-09-03 21:21:11
No the 13b sell off as hit 5k
@_date: 2018-04-02 12:00:32
Wow I should have bought in
