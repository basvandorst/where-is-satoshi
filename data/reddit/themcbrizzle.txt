Have you ever taken a class on Macro-economics, because your views have more than one flaw to them?

Great reply, better rebuttal, enjoy the rest of your below average life you mouth breather.

What the fuck are you talking about, why would you think I'm a creationist, you're probalby as stupid as you think other people are.  And I eat burger's, I don't get where you think I would be a vegetarian.  Weird weird stuff... enjoy proselytizing a form of currency you don't actually understand.

Alright, I'm sick of pseudo-intellectual libertarians thinking because they read an article from Alex Jones they understand the government, free trade, and history. Bitcoin is again, a completely different beast, the first time a... deflationary currency isn't even the right term... alternative currency is actually more accurate.  
Bitcoin isn't a counterfeit currency, or something a business uses to pay their employee's with in the 1900's.  It works more along the lines of transferring US dollars to another weighted currency.  The thing that makes Bitcoin different is the borderlessness, and it's intangable but it is also tied to other currencies.  Bitcoins exist because we can use US dollars which whether you agree or not, has been a relatively steady monetary device.
But bitcoin is also so interdependant on the internet, on other currencies, and subject to it's own version of market volatilities it won't just replace the US dollar, because it can't.  Not unless we make it legal tender.  I mean for fuck's sake we could use unregulated weights of shiny rocks but people outside of a fucking barder economy would have to accept the shiny rocks.
As for why Obama won, it's because all the bad policies Obama has, Mitt Romney's intentions were worse.  But hey people is people, and I'm sure your suburban household has always told you, you were special... so you can just go on pretending with them; if that's what you're into.

What about it?  What historical correlation do you have for what America is now?  There is none, even comparing other fallen empires isn't even a fair comparison because we're the first empire in the information technology age.  There is no historical presidence for what we are.  Hyperinflation won't attack us like it did in developing nations; we are far from being Argentina.
