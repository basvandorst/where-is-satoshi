Yeah, was just that split second when y'load it up without really caring, then have to do a double take. It's definitely not the first time Bitcoinity has done it for me, but can't say I've seen a billion, that'd be some sight!

He's a douche in general, never understood the 'woke' appeal.
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:58:44
You're a dickhead.
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:57:03
Jeez, that's mental. Hope he gets home above all else. :\
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:40:25
I've always internally pronounced it as 'Hoddle', which is actually [an ancient surname]( The only Hoddle I actually know is [Glenn Hoddle]( though, haha.
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:25:03
Long and short of it is buy if you actually want it. Maybe there'll be a bubble, maybe it'll burst at 20k, maybe it'll grow.. Probably, imo. Buy it if you want it, not at the whim of others on the search for a quick profit.
@_date: 2015-12-23 22:54:29


I'm speechless. 
@_date: 2018-05-08 08:12:15
Oh shut up.
@_date: 2014-04-21 17:19:23
I've only paid by NFC twice, and neither worked first time. Second and fourth tries respectively.
@_date: 2014-06-17 15:53:35
You are genuinely stupid. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 17:49:32


What a joke. Starting to regret my own involvement when this sort of wank is what's around.
@_date: 2014-06-21 00:18:08
Well I'd rather have preev anyway, so I can paste my balance in and see its worth.  
@_date: 2014-02-22 11:17:10
Never gonna be selling to another Chase account anyway after getting a payment to me marked as fraudulent.
@_date: 2014-06-20 12:15:01
When I changed the currency on LBC to GBP it was still +£100 above that on preev. It's not now, but it often is. 
@_date: 2014-03-13 13:28:41
In reality, does it not seem like Bitcoin will be to some degree regulated *everywhere*? 
@_date: 2014-03-19 16:23:16
Y'need somewhere we can put our names down to get notified.
@_date: 2014-05-19 08:05:14
@_date: 2014-05-18 18:22:06
There's a couple of reasons people don't take Bitcoin seriously - this is one.
@_date: 2014-05-18 20:11:23
When combined with memes, let's just say it suits a certain demographic.
@_date: 2014-07-19 08:40:53
XP is great. 
@_date: 2014-06-20 16:20:51
Looks great, at least for when I'm at my computer, but for this I'm literally only interested in the LocalBitcoins GBP price - can I do that here?
@_date: 2014-11-03 08:53:03
Are you having a laugh? 


This is hilarious bullshit. There's no way you typed that up with a serious face.
@_date: 2014-01-06 11:24:01
He was intentionally throwing away a PC. He was unintentionally throwing away a stack of money. You're the idiot here if you think the latter was intentional. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 09:12:57
Shock horror, a human forgot something. What a fucking dolt. 
@_date: 2014-06-17 14:04:10


Another self-entitled attitude - you have it backwards. It's not that the company wants to *save* money, it's that they'd rather not be being extraneous and unnecessary *costs*. There's a difference. 
@_date: 2014-06-17 22:26:38
What a lovely bunch you are. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 16:09:05
How would I deposit to Kraken from an account in the UK? I take it I'd be paying to do so.
@_date: 2014-02-15 11:17:58
What's better then?
@_date: 2014-05-18 17:25:32
Why would anyone ever take you seriously when you use phrases like 'jimmies were rustled'? Do you play Minecraft? Are you 13?
@_date: 2014-05-26 13:53:19
Can you change your passphrase?
@_date: 2014-08-13 12:16:04
It's going down, and down, and down. Slowly but surely. I'm starting to feel a lot less optimistic.
@_date: 2014-06-17 13:42:19


You're seriously taking the piss, right? 
@_date: 2014-01-09 15:02:49
@_date: 2014-06-17 15:13:22
Then don't do it, it's not like they removed card as an option, they just put up a fucking sign showing their preference.
Jesus fuck you people are stupid self-entitled cunts. 
@_date: 2014-06-17 15:23:31
I'll tell you how they're not being entitled: They don't fucking make you pay in cash - It's merely a fucking request.
Bloody hell, I can't have this conversation any more. Go learn how the fucking world works. 
@_date: 2014-01-05 23:45:42
You err, know it wasn't intentional, right?
@_date: 2014-08-13 15:07:23
You have no idea what price I bought in at. 
@_date: 2014-11-08 17:52:40
Which bank in Liverpool, Santander? I've had my account full on closed, not even just blocked.
@_date: 2014-05-27 17:05:06
My main bank is Santander, but yeah this is all foreign to me. 
@_date: 2014-05-18 20:10:32
.. haha, this post is another example of why people don't take it seriously, too. You know Bitcoin isn't an investment, either? It's a currency, not a get rich scheme.
I never said *I* don't take Bitcoin in a seriously, I've my own wallet and want it to succeed, but the thick-as-shit attitude that people show in is dreary at best.
@_date: 2014-04-21 17:22:40
I like the post, but the last 'side note' paragraph is nonsense.
@_date: 2014-01-10 01:10:23
Super lame caption, ugh.
@_date: 2014-05-28 09:37:49
Why would I want to do this when I can use my own quicksearches? I can add and remove them at will, not limited to those on DuckDuckGo, and it means I can type whatever the hell I want into the search query. 
Useless for anyone on desktop.
@_date: 2014-06-17 11:59:29
That's a stupid question that you already know the answer to. The aim is to remove the fees for credit card processing, you know that. 
@_date: 2014-08-13 18:00:52
You're making up your own point that's a country mile off the mark. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 00:27:08
Can you take a step back and read your own comment? I'll not call you dense quite yet, but.. Well, let's just say it wasn't intentional. Again. 
@_date: 2014-05-18 20:14:33
Exactly the point, isn't it.
@_date: 2014-02-13 19:52:49
That's what I'm interested in, too - There's not much posting about that here. All I see is good news.
@_date: 2014-05-28 09:59:53
People underutilise QuickSearches, and I don't know why. 
@_date: 2014-01-10 02:53:02
None, and I'd say that's the best of the lot.
@_date: 2014-06-17 14:51:59
Never seen it in my life in Ireland, England, Wales, France or Spain, but I'll take your word for it. 
@_date: 2014-08-23 10:32:51
What an idiot. 
@_date: 2014-06-17 13:15:24
Are you seriously so self-entitled that you believe using cash should get you a discount?
I'm dumbfounded - that's actually hilarious. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:07:31
Never been at a regular ATM in the EU that has fees to withdraw.
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:14:51
I live in Norway, but uh, ta. 
@_date: 2015-08-03 09:54:41
He is American. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:51:04
@_date: 2018-07-16 09:38:44
Aye, me too.
@_date: 2015-03-06 09:11:25
Cringe so fucking much.
