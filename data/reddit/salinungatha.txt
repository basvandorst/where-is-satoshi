Not impossible to tax. In my country as soon as I convert to my local currency capital gains tax applies. Local KYC laws also apply to exchanges to combat money laundering. 
So as long as Governments keep key purchases from being paid in Bitcoin, they will extract their cut and do quite nicely.
Or they can choose to accept Bitcoin, and do even more nicely.

Tax evasion and money laundering don't apply to me. 
Being priced out of the housing market, effectively zero interest rates on savings and a sharemarket due for collapse does apply to me.
Bitcoin is probably the hardest/soundest money ever invented and possibly the most lucrative financial deal I ever involve myself in. Not only that,  it's interesting, beautiful and fun.
Should its trajectory continue, my government taking their cut will be the least of my problems. Should it fail, j will have had fun and lost but little of import.

I hate to break it to you but the best tech usually doesn't win. Good enough tech with network effect does.
In order to counter Bitcoins network effect, its competitors don't need to be better. They need to be orders of magnitude better. They need to do things Bitcoin can never replicate on a second layer. None so far have this advantage.

Government crypto will be indistinguishable from fiat, and inflated out the wazoo similarly.
It's not a question of fixing Bitcoins weaknesses but beating its key features. Which are (1) Network effect (2) Ever lower inflation trending to zero (3) No leadership.
As such Bitcoin is likely to adopt a position as the crypto reserve currency. Used as a store of value and final settlement layer. Read the book 'the Bitcoin Standard' for an in depth explanation.

I did that this week, told them Bitpay failed and so I bought off a competitor instead. They responded by telling me that they have no competition (wtf!) and that I should have emailed them asking for a Bitcoin payment address.

The key strengths of Bitcoin are not its tech. First mover effect, network effect, ever lower inflation, and - most important and most difficult to replicate - leaderless. 
Not impossible for Bitcoin to die by a long shot, but it has a formidable head start.
@_date: 2018-08-06 21:27:03
Based on what? All competing currencies are less than an order of magnitude better in tech terms. And all other currencies have leadership that can inflate the supply, which is a massive value risk.

It is a fantastic book that does a superb job of explaining Bitcoins unique value and usefulness proposition.
Unfortunately the author puts in way too many of his opinions on other matters - personal hatred of Keynes, poor quality of modern art, hardcore libertarian ideals etc. These will be used by critics as a stick to beat the author with and so avoid having to address the compelling argument for Bitcoin.
A pity because his argument for Bitcoin is compelling and needs to be taken seriously.

What a bunch of pathetic arseholes. Satoshi has every right to privacy and doesn't owe anyone anything. To the contrary, the world owes him a debt of gratitude.

Bitcoin/Blockchain disrupts their business model. Google  makes massive profits on the "thin protocol/fat applications" model (i.e the web). In this model value is mainly captured in the application layer.

In Australia you pay capital gains tax if you sell Bitcoin for fiat, but have no tax liability if you use it for small transactions.
"Generally, there will be no income tax or GST implications if you are not in business or carrying on an enterprise and you simply pay for goods or services in bitcoin (for example, acquiring personal goods or services on the internet using Bitcoin). Where you use bitcoin to purchase goods or services for personal use or consumption, any capital gain or loss from disposal of the bitcoin will be disregarded (as a personal use asset) provided the cost of the bitcoin is $10,000 or less."

Money - like Governments, Corporations and Countries - is a consensus agreed fiction. In that case, why does there have to be a major correction? Why can't the powers that be simply continue to modify the agreed fiction when needed in order to retain a basic status quo? Being fiction, it is infinitely malleable. The only real problem is getting people to agree, and if it saves them from short term pain, they probably will.

It's not necessarily the best crypto ledger from a technology point of view, but it's better than all the non-crypto ledgers. But given Metcalf's law it'll take a lot to unseat it. It doesn't need to be the best from a tech POV, it just needs to be good enough. Many people use the MySpace analogy, but I think MS-DOS-Windows is better. Never the best, but good enough to maintain its position.

As an Aussie, can I use these to legally avoid Capital Gains Tax?
The tax code states: "Using Bitcoin to pay for personal transactions... Where you use bitcoin to purchase goods or services for personal use or consumption, any capital gain or loss from disposal of the bitcoin will be disregarded (as a personal use asset) provided the cost of the bitcoin is $10,000 or less."
So if I convert Bitcoin to cash, which I then use for personal transactions, will that be CGT free? Or does the CGT exemption only apply if I make a purchase directly in Bitcoin without converting to cash first?

Think very seriously about deleting this thread and all your comments. Targeting is real.
If you have an address with just one or two BTC in it, consider writing out the keys by hand , going to a different computer and running a test or two. The more you practice, the more comfortable you will feel.
If for some reason it doesn't work out, try to not let it get to you, you'll find your feet so to speak, one way or another.
