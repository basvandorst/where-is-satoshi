and what happened to the Dollar would indeed happen to BTC if the Government got involved.


Getting taxed and get OVER taxed are two separate things. Comon man, fix your own track mind before you start voting..

I am saying you should go see a fucking doctor. Stop sitting at the tables, stop thinking about pot odds and stop ordering food to your table.

Where do you play again?
@_date: 2013-04-05 15:37:11
Not really a problem? 
Oh ok, good. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:39:28
Trollness? Explain how I am trolling? Telling you guys something that is obviously very fucking true is now considered trolling?

I refuse to take role of US History Teacher today. Find another redditor to do your research for you.
@_date: 2013-03-13 18:39:57
The only one worth it.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:23:08
Yeah, think about those who bought in at $40..not very much money to buy in, yet they walked away with more than what they started with..alot more. If you buy one share of any stock for $40, profits are minimal.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:25:12
Yup, if you have at least 50 bucks, You should think about placing an order for a coin, that way you can snag at least one full coin.
@_date: 2013-03-13 17:58:53
Couple issues with WinPoker. Yes, they are excepting bitcoin, but not US Players. You deposit the coin and it turns into a "cash value", then when you cash out, it follows their normal cash out process.
IMO, poker sites should really only accept Bitcoin if they are ALSO accepting US Players. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:12:05
I don't think that is necessary. Market Speculation and Crash/price spike talk is what bitcoin is all about.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:02:03
This seems more like a joke if anything...
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:57:20
MTGOX doesn't need to be REPLACED..there just needs to be a decent alternative. We need more competition in the community. BTC-E is somewhat decent, but it's not very convenient for most at all. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:25:52
haha here we go.
Are you saying the Illuminati didn't exist?
Are you saying the Bilderberg Group doesn't exist?

Regarding stock, but this is the basic definition of how a bubble occurs.
Also, read up on the .com bubble. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:05:21
This here you typical redditor...
It's not being dismissive..involving established banking institutions would totally kill the entire reason why bitcoin is here to begin with or did you forget that
@_date: 2013-03-13 18:38:12
not too familiar with them at all. The only one IMO, that is worth anything is Seals with Clubs as they are BTC only. 1 BTC = 1000 Chips. You chose the address that you want the withdrawals to be sent to and you are good to go.  
@_date: 2013-03-19 18:10:20
The majority of the population of the US openly accepts new taxes on items. No Joke, they actually draft legislation CALLING for it. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:35:17
My biggest concern is that when the crashes happen..are we going to see exchanges just cut off all trading? So no one unless they already have money in BTC-E, can trade at the low prices? That is a major concern for me. 
If you can't capitlize off down swings..why the fuck even have it all ?
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:03:09
When you say "new trading options" are we talking other Crypto's? like Litecoin?
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:30:28
haha, make sure to hold down the Shift button for every time you strike the 1 key. 
@_date: 2013-03-13 21:34:29
Right! My first deposit was so nice! Sent the coin, went out for a smoke, came back and I took a seat. 
PM your username, I'll keep a look out for you and maybe we can get on a table sometime.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:24:01
While it does, not at this time. No company in the right mind will accept such a thing the way these swings are coming. When it becomes stable, you are absolutely correct. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:14:03
You are new here aren't you?

Just by naming off those two groups, you know nothing of who could really be behind it. Go back to @_date: 2013-04-15 15:57:42
I think this might be a good thing..audits will sky rocket.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:05:18
I can't believe the hate you are getting on here! Makes me really lose hope in reddit! 
People, people! This dude tipped people, some of whom probably really needed that money and you are going to hate on him!
Keep on keepin on brother! 
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:13:45
What? You should totally buy into something that drastically changes up and down if you are looking to make money! Bitcoin is like the ultimate tool for day trading. 
Go buy some stock and tell me how quickly you will make THE SAME profits as some did with bitcoin..
@_date: 2013-03-20 21:42:35
Fuck him.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:43:35
He doesn't define reality? He just admitted that he went there. Are you saying he is lying about his time with the Bilderberg Group? Or does a bunch of wealthy people and politicians just happen to show up and the hotel at the same exact time?
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:28:06
I am saying one DID exist, and I don't believe it does any longer, and I believe the Bilderberg Group does exist and well..it's been admitted haha 
@_date: 2013-03-19 18:12:36
sorry, more like 1.4, taxed bitch!
@_date: 2013-03-19 18:24:53
Positive? Are you fucking kidding me. The entire idea of BTC was to get away from a currency that was being over regulated and controlled by a complex tax code that is complete bullshit..now you are welcoming the same thing for BTC?! get fucked dude.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:33:53
So now you are saying that the Bilderberg doesn't exist and if you believe it does, you also believe in the Reptilian Conspiracy Theory? Really?
So what the fuck was Tony Blair talking about than?
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:10:45


Bringing in major financial institutions such as those from the banking industry would undermine the entire reason behind BTC. If you want to deal with them, I suggest you go back or continue trading stock.
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:54:00


You act as if you know this as a fact?


If you honestly have an issue with this, you should not be involved in any sort of investments..ever. You sound like a child honestly. 


Oh trust me I will be dead silent when it comes crashing down.


You sound upset?
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:12:59
How original. 
So how long you playing player poker and losing you fuck?
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:11:12
it would be foolish not to think that something bigger could be behind this..

1-800 Get-Fucked. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:27:29
God I am getting so sick of tired of your seeing you dumb ass motherfucker complain about fucking bitcoin exchanges/services. Don't you fucking get it?! This is the risk you take! Learn to deal with it and move on and if you are putting all your eggs in one basket you deserve to watch them fall and smash into the ground when the basket breaks
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:38:46
You are fucking sick.
You said


In response to


So tell me what the fuck that means.
@_date: 2013-03-13 21:33:37
Apparently not. Haven't used it myself though, but I don't plan on it. I'll stick with SWC for now.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:09:52
If you ALREADY have money in an exchange other than MTGOX that is up and running, go for and start buying them up..but the worst part is that some people either A) don't have any money in an exchange that is up B) cannot use BitInstant to get any money into an exchange that is up.
So those people are SOL when it comes to buying up BTC at these low prices. I was sorta lucky and had some LTC sitting around, and was able to trade those in for BTC at $60. I would love to drop more at BTC and LTC but I can't use BitInstant to get any money into the exchange right now as BI is only allowing transfers to MTGOX which will be down for at least the next 10 hours.
