I don't think its referring to you. Its referring to the miners.

This is what I thought.... There are a lot more articles about this that all state the same thing. 
1. 
2. 
But i guess they are misleading and they mean the energy required to mine a block?

Dude the articles are saying that the bitcoin network as whole uses X amount of energy per day and there are X amount of transactions per day. If you divide the total amount of energy used per day by the network by the amount of transactions per day you get a number that roughly equals the amount of energy an average household would use in a week...

Here is the article I'm referring to. 
This averages out to a shocking 215 kilowatt-hours (KWh) of juice used by miners for each Bitcoin transaction (there are currently about 300,000 transactions per day). Since the average American household consumes 901 KWh per month, each Bitcoin transfer represents enough energy to run a comfortable house, and everything in it, for nearly a week.

I don't know thats why I'm asking. As it states in the article pretty clearly it says per transaction. So I'm confused. I did not believe it myself.
