so again this shouldn't create any inherent risk for the other exchanges.

is there a video link to this anywhere?

do you think the price might be volatile because it has to appreciate in value so much to reach its final form?  it can't handle everyone's daily transactions without a market cap of many trillions of dollars.
@_date: 2018-01-25 21:41:54
i agree- and the point i tried to make is that in order to complete that many transactions BTC needs to be 150k+++ per coin.  the market needs to be so valuable that the billions of dollars moving around constantly being bought / sold / traded don't affect the price of bitcoin very much so that people then view it as having a stable value to facilitate commerce.

480k for an apartment deposit seems like a lot.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:50:17
i still can't figure out why this would affect the exchanges.  as long as their only exposure to tether is from users' accounts, they shouldn't have any balance sheet risk from a coin on their markets going to zero.  why would an exchange like binance / poloniex / kraken be at any risk at all?
@_date: 2018-01-26 12:18:55
hopefully they can recover some of that 47 billion JPY worth of NEM
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:14:59
who is arbing though?  are exchanges arbing their own tether markets and then going to bitfinex to settle?  or is it users who are doing this arbing?  mt.gox went under because assets in their custody got stolen not because the assets crashed in value.

I think a big reason for bitcoin losing share of the market cap these last two weeks was the IS tax bill. As of Jan 1st converting btc to any other holding becomes a taxable event where you have to disclose your btc gains. Anyone who was thinking about diversifying got forced into action.  This catalyst disappears on 1/1 and I expect a bounce back.

since bitcoin's existence the stock market (us s&amp;p 500) has basically gone up 4x.  so throughout its existence, it's generally gone the same direction as the stock market.

Fortunately by the time we get there gold will likely be much higher than today’s prices- could easily be 1m/btc before we catch up to gold.  bTC goes x80 while gold x2.7 sounds like a new roaring 20’s

I’m sure you’ve been asked this in the past, but what advice would you give to people who fear their country’s currency may fall into hyperinflation like Venezuela’s.  Is there anything a non-connected person can do to somewhat insulate themselves from the collapse?  Like if you had prepared by moving to a small farm outside of the cities could you still be alright or have they been robbed of their animals / crops.

the day lehman brother's went under i went to a jp morgan chase in chicago to take out 15,000 because i thought it wouldn't be safe in the banking system.  they had to call to 3 other banks before they found one that had the money.  they then tried to explain to me why it was normal for the banks to not have that much money on hand which made me even more fearful at the time.

i'm stuck at update screen on step 5.  
i tried restarting ledger manager, disconnecting and reconnecting nano s both while touching no buttons and while holding down button near the usb.  
when holding no buttons it simply starts to "update" but my ledger manager never changes from "to begin, connect your ledger wallet".  
if i hold the button near the USB down it starts into bootloading on nano s and the manager starts restoring MCU for about 4 seconds and then the ledger manager switches back to "to begin, connect your ledger wallet" and the ledger simply stays at "update".

It’s not a large enough market by volume traded (or open interest)  to have much influence yet.

but they didn't have futures to give access to institutional investors back then.  the doors to the biggest lockboxes in investing opened a month and a half ago and it'll take them a few more months to head towards the open doors.  the flood of money coming into btc through those doors from ~sep18-dec19 will be staggering.

the stability probably won't kick in until 300k+.  even the gold market is wild compared to fiat currencies and that is the equiv of something like 600k btc.
