What is Coinbase doing to manipulate the price?
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:12:26
I said *sell*
You can buy bitcoin from many different places...bitcoin ATM, LocalBitCoins, from people on the street, from an exchange, etc.
@_date: 2018-01-08 21:57:36
You could always just sell like .0001 for one green US Rothschild for recreational purposes. Of course withdraw to bank through gdax to avoid any fees

Pretty sure it’s illegal to sell them there based on the recent sting that hit the news, but it’s a grey area

The merkleroot is a single hash representing all of the transactions included in a particular block
@_date: 2018-06-02 20:18:54
When you look at a block explorer the transactions inside the block should be in the same order that the merkleroot was calculated
@_date: 2018-06-02 20:37:32
Here is an example script of how you can recalculate merkleroots:
Check the merkleroot and transaction hashes on: 
 
@_date: 2018-06-02 20:13:39
Each transaction in a block is essentially partnered up in groups of two and hashed together, the resulting hashes are then partnered up again in the same fashion, over and over again until there is only one hash representing all of the txs.
A block with 4txs would be something like hash(hash(hash(tx1). hash(tx2)). hash(hash(tx3). hash(tx4)))

@_date: 2019-06-23 14:41:04
Miners are rewarded to keep their nodes online to validate and move transactions from an unconfirmed state to a confirmed state..I.e. the transactions are added to a block. A block is basically a batch of transactions that is cleared every 10 minutes. Miners receive a block reward for winning the race, and they also collect the fees on all the transactions they choose to include in the block.

@_date: 2017-11-09 11:41:38
That’s not how inflation works. If you hold a $20 bill and there is some rate of inflation, then you lose that percent of purchasing power of the $20 cash you held.
@_date: 2017-11-09 11:48:12

How many BTC did you pick up
@_date: 2018-11-29 04:51:38
Basically you would have to guess 32 numbers from 0 to 255 in a particular order. I’m sure it could happen eventually at random however it is probably outside of the scope of our current level of technology to go through all the combinations and then pass the values through the elliptic curve functions and address hashes and check if the key actually has a balance or not in any efficient manner. We are safe for now, when it becomes a problem we will move to something more secure

@_date: 2019-05-22 04:28:43
If you’re talking about an exchange, then the exchange controls the “private key”.
If you create your own wallet outside of an exchange, the addresses that you can receive bitcoin and then send it from are derived from a random 256 bit number (64 hexadecimal character string) aka the “private key”.
The public key is a mathematical counterpart to the private key. Wallet “addresses” are derivatives of the public key.
When sending bitcoin you sign a transaction with the private key. If the signature is not cryptographically accurate the transaction will not be accepted by the bitcoin network.
