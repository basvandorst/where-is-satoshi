Aaaand its gone.

Depending on what model you look at, it is a possibility in the near future.
Now I'm not saying I believe that will happen, but it should be taken into consideration.

Lol I forgot this was reddit, where everybody's an english teacher...
Its ok, you'll probably get burned real nice in the next few days if you actually get your money anyways.

You can't use E-transfer anywhere since it is reversible, but Cavirtex will take an online banking transfer and deposit into your account within hours.

Completely agreed, most of the "HOLD" posts seem to be part of a personal agenda to profit.
Its more like HOLD!!.... because otherwise I'll lose more than the 50% I already lost, please guys?
Everybody writing this stuff is just doing it to further their own goals, and nobody on this forum knows what is going to happen next.

You can do cash deposit to Virtex and you don't need verification unless you want to withdraw more than 5k at a time or hold over 10k in your exchange account.
Verification isn't needed unless you are pushing around some larger sums.

DON'T BUY ANYTHING UNTIL YOU HAVE A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS GOING ON
If you don't know anything about candlestick trading, or bitcoin I suggest you spend at least a few weeks studying up on both unless you want to get horribly burned, preferably longer if your putting larger amounts in.
That is how you can be successful with bitcoin.

Fly to a tax haven, open a bank account, transfer.
Easy as pie.

Based off of what? There was no real resistance at 75, lots of uncertainty in the market right now..
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:06:54
Thats really unusual....
Call customer support and see whats up
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:46:32
Lots of things
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:24:45
There will be a panic sell, look at the other exchanges.
Massive drops going to be happening again today.
When Gox reopens it will be dragged down by all the others (BTC-E, Bitfloor, BTC24, etc)

I have no holdings at all in BTC, and I'm just a pure speculator who's not touching this with a 10 foot pole right now.
I'm just saying the odds are slim but there.
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:19:43
Just a swing, no way it will go over 100, too much resistance there, probably won't even break 95.
@_date: 2013-04-13 04:06:37
But of course, that means we should all just buy now! and if we all dump our savings we'll all be trillionaires right?
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:43:03
Of course we can
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:17:22
Just go through Cavirtex, its the most pain-free especially since you already deposited.
I remember they recently said they would start processing deposits 3x a day or more.
Hope ya get yours soon.

Clarkmoody showing 88, bitcoinity showing 92.8
Shits all sorts of fucked up
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:25:04
That doesn't even make any sense
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:21:47
I lost -$700
(double negative!)
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:43:00
Sure, it will stabilize...
At 40 maybe.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:34:16
And another one! Whats going on right now...
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:36:39
I guess if your willing to accept low liquidity at a time like this then do it, but I prefer to be able to actually buy and sell more than 10 btc at a time.
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:20:37
That is definitely is
