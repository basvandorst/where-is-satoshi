Yes, Balance. Because we are in times of unprecedented monetary policy. The pendulum has swung so far in the direction of easy lending that btc at the very least as a hedge or alternative makes sense
@_date: 2019-07-04 08:34:20
I kinda agree. Bitcoin is still very new in the eyes of many, that does  matter in terms of price . Theoretically it should behave like gold. It’s been interesting because it has moved with gild, but only as of late. Other times it has moved like a risky asset , up with the ups and down with  downs.  No doubt it’s risky, when times are tough people are risk adverse
But we focus on the relative and near term and lose sight of the bigger picture . . The larger forces are what matter. 1940 you bought a coke for a nickel. Now you can’t even buy anything with a nickel ..  But that nickel of btc should still be a nickel 50 years from now. To me that’s powerful.

In general if the US dollar weakens , the us can compete better on exports because they become cheaper. Also imports become more expensive, which in general makes things pricier , less buying power, but could encourage us products in the long run.

A misconception of deflation is that you won’t go to beach tomorrow or buy a dress because it’ll be cheaper 5% next year. People still buy it and economy continues. 
Price will change, but as a whole, globally .  Just like inflation changes price up deflation changes price down.  The movement of price does create the need for adjustments and opportunities for entrepreneurs , and so it goes

 If bitcoin is in fact the new “digital gold” then we should see it correlate to gold.  From what I’ve seen , it’s not until recently that we’ve seen  gold/bitcoin correlation.  This is a good sign because if bitcoin can take some of the market share of gold it would suggest bitcoins price should be higher by quite a lot. Gold is not subject to inflation and ticks up when the dollar weakens.  Dollar weakens when central banks lower rates , often to stimulate economy.  This is why gold is a hedge. For this reason bitcoin should be a hedge as well. Now there are many other things that move bitcoin and for that matter gold too. A good percentage of gold moves due to the jewelry market and a smaller part due to industrial uses. Therefore there could and should be reasons for divergence.

First off if it was just used as a store of money I think it would be an incredible success. Btc  has the ability to be a currency though right now it’s use is low.  When given the choice of spending your non inflationary currency vs your inflationary currency you’ll drop the inflationary first. 
Deflation happens in all sorts of scenarios and in prosperous times. You can have growth and deflation 
Please read/watch this :
[Deflationary Currency, Bitcoin, and Just a Store of Value ](
we are in time of unprecedented monetary policy, where central banks are near 0 and even negative rates.  Corporate debt is now at an all time high. Inflating the debt to keep from collapse seems like a viscous cycle.    There are those that believe this is causing underlying damage to the economy. This was one of the reasons why btc was created and why people desire this alternative.
@_date: 2019-07-14 06:43:30
Bitcoin is not new. It’s 10 years old and has not disappeared and grown significantly.  With time there is more trust.  For sure there will be people who may never, but younger generations are more open. So on the matter of trust , I think bitcoin has been  gaining more and more trust.

 Obviously if people are hodling more versus selling price will naturally go up. So there is no surprise that there is a correlation.

We probably need to hear about the specifics of this quite a bit more before we can really have any strong opinions . However, This coin seems like it will compete more with stable coins as it is pegged to fiats.  For Facebook to want to use a decentralized platform is a little bit of a question mark for me. Perhaps they are trying to keep a little bit of distance from this type of product so that they don’t appear to actually control it. 
One big thing that may come out of this is that governments may need to now speed up how they are going to approach And regulate the space.

Perhaps not warren buffet, but I think they are definitely watching and more actually understand than they let on.  They need to dismiss it in public otherwise they risk legitimizing.
Part of me believes that there are those that do understand why these technologies have potential to greatly improve financial systems.  They can look past the banks. That tamping down of crypto is tamping down on innovation which will ultimately be bad for the future .  Also you can only control what’s in your borders, so it’s not a single countries choice. Ultimately if people start switching out of reserve currencies in other countries that will be enough.
In other words it would be a dumb thing to do, and even they know this.
