Not on blockchain no, yet localBTC says that it sent the coins to my EXACT blockchain wallet. i've done this process 10+ times, and its always been near instant.

Im confused as to what you mean by this, how do i go about that? Nothings in my transaction history as nothings been received.
Sorry if im coming off as pretty new to all of this. I've never had difficulties in the past
