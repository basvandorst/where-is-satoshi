Yeah, I was just reading their site. I have an instant access of $500. I bought 2 BTC at once and only got the $500 worth, now I have to wait for the rest of th transactions to clear the bank to get the rest. I really need to talk to them so I can upgrade my instant amount to like $1200 if that is possible.

Me too, other than the SLI problems. It is great, especially since they put the Robocop   gun from Blood Dragon. I still enjoyed BD more than 3 or 4, so far.

FWIW, I have deposited and withdrawn from Circle with no hassle. I have it linked to a checking account that was set up just for using BTC. I have never needed to provide ID. The only thing I will say is that depositing money from Circle to your cheeking account takes a few days, whereas withdrawing is pretty much instant. I have not bought any large amounts of BTC no more than $100 at a time. I have playing around with lots of deposits and withdraws to see how long it takes for them to go through.

Got my bumper sticker, thanks man
Picture this:  An old S-10 with fishing poles in the back with an old hillbilly looking dude driving it listening to hiphop with a bitcoin sticker next to my AAA and fishing bumper stickers. I am gonna make people look twice for sure.

Same boat. This has been my first week as well. Made my first purchase today on overstock using BTC. Exciting times!

Has anyone received their miner(s) yet? detro has been gone since making this offer. I hope everything is okay with detro, and I also hope I didn't get scammed out of $5 for shipping.

Holy shit, i forgot all about eudora.

I really like Agora. I have purchased 15 Oz. of silver from them using BTC in the last few weeks. Cheap and quick shipping.

Not everyone is an autodidact. Most people do not posses the discipline to learn something new without the threat of a bad grade.

I never realized what this service did. Truly awesome!
@_date: 2014-10-21 19:33:39
I feel the same way.
@_date: 2014-10-06 23:08:09
What do you mean the wallet file? The executable? Is there a stored config file somewhere?
@_date: 2014-10-18 00:42:25
I just bought some silver from them with bitcoins today. They were processed and shipped in a matter of hours. I hope to get them Monday.

Which wallet is good for a new bitcoin user?
How do I move my BTC from circle to said wallet?
What is a paper wallet?
@_date: 2014-10-06 22:51:13
Again thanks for the help! Went with Electrum, sent some coin to that wallet from Circle. No problem at all. It was far easier than I was expecting.

I buy bullion from Agora Commodities.

Got mine today! Thanks detro! I was worried you got caught up in some darkmarket bust or some shit.

Look into gapcoin too. Searches for large prime numbers.
@_date: 2014-10-07 01:26:59
Done! Thanks for the all the help. Now I just need to buy something with it.
@_date: 2014-11-06 23:09:56
Gapcoin is CPU minable right now, but it is not worth anything really ($.04). That being said it searches for large primes so it is at least useful in that way.

/. is anti Bitcoin? Seems like something they would get behind. I used to read it regularly about 5 years ago, but it started to become a bunch of Ads so I left.

I opened a separate account just for bitcoin to bypass that very issue. You may want to do that instead.

Give you cash back on all your purchases and 5% cash back on certain alternating things each month. If you pay off your balances every month it's like getting a discount on all purchases. That being said, most cards give similar or better benefits nowadays, but I think Discover did it first.

Very, very true. once you have kids pretty much everything is scary and dangerous, even if you used to do it.
