That example sounds more like 2 LN channels, one for the 0.5 BTC and a new one for the 1 BTC from the exchange. But if you wanted to just withdraw 1 BTC from the exchange you would not use LN as that just adds an extra on-chain transaction to the process.

Seems to me like almost everyone would set a password. BUT, watching only wallets default is to not set a password, potentially exposing your master public key to a hacker. SO what, they still can't steal my bitcoin you say? What if they fork bitcoin and get you to claim their shit alt coin on some closed source wallet software ... you then transfer the bitcoin to a new address to claim the fork coin on the previous address thereby giving them a child private key. Child private key plus master public key equals disaster.

That would be a channel with 1 BTC inside, the OP mentions only 0.5 BTC. The safe metaphor is spot on, but in the case of LN both parties can add to the safe, but you still can't take out more than the total that was put in.
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:36:29
It would be much safer to just open a LN channel (1 on chain tx) with the exchange and almost never close it. After you spend the bitcoin just buy it back, you could basically do all your transactions from that single channel.

The tether basics is that dealing with banks sucks, large accounts get closed or frozen. So tether deals with multiple small accounts spread out among multiple banks or something and issues tether that is backed 1:1 by USD (probably in multiple currencies).
The conspiracy is that the tether isn't backed 1:1 and they are just pulling it out of nowhere and using it to artificially inflate the price of crypto.

The software is supposed to handle everything, but if you have 2 LN channels then you are responsible for both of them.


For that to be possible they would need 1 channel open with EACH person, that is a lot of money, probably unrealistic.

ASICs weren't envisioned and do centralise mining a bit, but the alternative is hackers infecting computers to make and use botnet armies to mine. At least ASICs are stable, botnet armies would come online and go offline all the time as antivirus software caught up and a new one was made. So lesser of two evils I guess (?).
The main function was to put the control of the currency into the hands of the people, and that is still very much true in the form of validating nodes. No one can just print 10x the amount of bitcoin and devalue your life savings for example.

Wrapping your head around the LN is hard because to understand it you need to be able to think about it at each scale. 
In the you -&gt; Alice -&gt; Bob example
Lets say you have a channel with Alice where you have 1 mBTC, she has 0 BTC and the coffee costs 0.5 mBTC 
Alice has a channel with Bob where she has 0.1 mBTC and Bob has 0.9 mBTC
You can't route through her because she can't first send 0.5 mBTC to Bob.
Now, lets change it up:
you have 1 mBTC, she has 0 BTC (and the coffee still costs 0.5 mBTC)
Alice has a channel with Bob where she has 1 mBTC and Bob has 0 mBTC
You can route through her, she send 0.5 mBTC to Bob and you send 0.5 mBTC to her.
Now the you - Alice channel is 0.5 mBTC you, 0.5 mBTC Alice
and the Alice - Bob channel has 0.5 mBTC Alice, 0.5 mBTC Bob
Neither channel exceeds the on-chain transaction value that set it up, but the amounts have changed a bit.
Now Alice only has enough BTC in that channel for 1 coffee, I don't know how Alice feels about that but I wouldn't be very happy.
SO, it is far more likely that you will actually go you -&gt; LN hub -&gt; bob.
@_date: 2018-01-05 06:24:29
Yeah that looks good, but each increase in the number of users of a channel increases the chance that a person will want to close, which forces everyone to close.
I guess my interpretation of withdrawing 1 BTC would be into a private wallet, probably even a cold storage wallet. There are so many different factors to consider that I am basically in a 'wait and see' mindset about the whole thing.

Just give them the address and keep a hold of the seed words for them.

The transactions would go through, but the node attrition as the required bandwidth and storage go exponential would be huge. The thing with alt coins that have higher throughput potential is that pretty much none of them are even close to needing that much throughput.

You don't see it going ahead? Nug, it already happened! The hearing was a farce, all the politicians kept talking about facebook. But facebook is legally removed now, they can't be made to do shit. Libra is not decentralised like bitcoin, but it is decentralised enough to escape any government. It is no coincidence that only a minority amount of companies have been named, Libra Networks LLC is already set up and in a country that isn't going to stop it, even if USA issued a court order to all named companies to shut Libra down, they would not be able to reach a majority in the Libra consortium and could get overruled. The code is already nearing completion, Marcus made ZERO commitments during that hearing, all he did was dodge questions and claim that they won't go ahead until all regulatory aspects had been addressed. But what does addressed mean? It doesn't mean anything, if someone tells you can't do something and you determine they have no authority to make that order then technically you have addressed that.

If you could get 5 years wage now and then never get any more money ever again would you take that deal? No, it's a shit deal. That is why the miners don't do it, they could work together to steal money from a few exchanges once and once only at which point bitcoin and all crypto go to zero and all their infrastructure becomes worthless. That doesn't even take into account the possibility of some of miners claiming will take part in the attack but actually working against the group to gain a time advantage in mining the next blocks. The risks and losses are much greater than any potential reward, it is more profitable to stay honest.

Multinational companies took over governments more than a decade ago, not in a tin foil hat conspiratorial way. It happened from individual companies funding election campaigns of individual members of government and heavily implying that continued funding requires that member to work at least partially in the interest of that company. The result is a government stacked with members all working in the interest of big business because that is what actually gets them elected.
No one government in the world can stop Libra now because Libra aren't constrained by the borders that those governments are and the governments are all stacked with individuals sympathetic to the interests of big companies. Only a massive coalition of governments could stop Libra at this point and that level of cooperation is rare.

 From Wikipedia
Depending on who is doing the research, it is said that the US has  raised its debt ceiling (in some form or other) at least 90 times in the  20th century.[\[11\]]( 
The debt ceiling was raised 74 times from March 1962 to May 2011,[\[12\]]( including 18 times under [Ronald Reagan]( eight times under [Bill Clinton]( seven times under [George W. Bush]( and five times under [Barack Obama]( In practice, the debt ceiling has never been reduced, even though the public debt itself may have reduced. 
Congress has raised the debt ceiling 14 times from 2001-2016. The  debt ceiling was raised a total of 7 times (total increase of $5365bil)  during Pres. Bush's eight-year term and it was raised 11 times (as of  03/2015 a total increase of $6498bil) during Pres. Obama's eight years  in office. 
The debt ceiling is like starting that diet 'tomorrow'. It's never tomorrow, always today.

What's the point being rich if you can't get the things you want. At some point everyone makes enough profit on their early investment to want to start locking some of that in. Some people do that profit taking by selling for fiat, some are waiting until they can do profit taking simply by spending bitcoin.

Bitcoin is an evolving project, if you haven't looked at it for even a few months. Don't do anything until you catch up on the news. But yeah, HD wallets totally changed the game, but they made it more simple actually. You no longer need to individually back up every single private key, you can just back up the 12/24 word phrase that can generate (and regenerate) all the keys. No more losing your latest funds because a computer crashed and you didn't back that private key up yet.

Fixing the problem of wealth distribution is not something that will happen fast, it absolutely can't be if we want it to work. A system that actually has a decent distribution mechanism will not be affected by bitcoin's uneven distribution because the system will be designed to re-distribute in a more even manner. The only possible way to get to that goal is through a slow transition and inevitably the dismantling or takeover of multinationals.

It's a stupid example. Hubs will most likely be early investors that have 10k+ BTC


How do start ups work step by step? There isn't a single correct answer. Here's an example though, someone got into BTC early and is pretty good with computers (I don't know the correlation there but my guess is very high) and decides to make a LN hub, they have the BTC capital and the technical know how to bootstrap a hub and add in more programmers as it grows.

\&gt;  am I doing something wrong? 
YES. You can send a transaction for a few sat per byte. The mempool is currently empty and has emptied each day for a few days, there was not reason to use that big a fee. If however you are talking about withdrawing bitcoin from an exchange then it might be a different story, some exchanges charge a withdrawal fee and that can be quite ridiculously high at some exchanges.

I read it, it doesn't talk about block size or how you can make old nodes see empty blocks while still seeing them as valid. Seeing empty blocks doesn't let old nodes validate any transactions.
Segwit allows old nodes to still see valid 1 Mb blocks while updated nodes see 2 Mb blocks, that is a soft fork because all nodes still see and validate the same blocks with the same transactions.

1 and 2 are wrong and stem from a misunderstanding. You don't store the bitcoin, you store the private key that gives access to them. The blockchain stores the bitcoin as belonging to that private key. If you lose the private key then you lose access to the bitcoin, they are forever a part of the blockchain. So what is stored offline is just a copy of the private key.

They buy BTC at a slightly lower rate than they sold to you of course. For example if the spot price is 15000 they sell it to you at 15500, then they buy from someone at 14500 and make a profit. This is the business model of any exchange of anything.

OR those shorts are going to have to buy bitcoin before futures open, which given the low supply could have a huge affect on the price, say taking it from 1k to 16k in the span of a few months and then short and dump.
But on the flipside all the bulls were slowly selling into that big buying spree with the intention of soaking up all the dump and holding the price not only steady, but positive, heavily burning the shorts.

Early adopters, miners and people reducing their risk. If you put 5% of your portfolio into BTC and it is now 90% of your portfolio (for example) then it might be a good idea to re-distribute that a little.
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:07:34
It is a legit concern, but as you mentioned, right now it is all 'could' and 'will be able to'. As soon as it gets to 'can for an easier version of the problem' people will be able to see how it does the breaking and work on solutions that are quantum resistant. Even with encryption breaking being almost completely theoretical there are people working on quantum resistance (not bitcoin specifically). My guess is that it will be Y2K all over again, so much of our internet systems use encryption and cryptographics, it's not like bitcoin is the only thing vulnerable here.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:20:12
One exchange has been seriously hacked in 9 years, so don't use an exchange for long term storage. But short term is probably fine. Exchanges have learned the lesson and now mostly keep their coins offline, that's part of the reason withdrawal takes so long to even show up in the mempool. Waiting a few days or even weeks is not a very high risk.

Article is poorly written and unclear. Are they saying buying BTC will become exempt from GST meaning that you currently have to pay GST just to buy/sell BTC? or are they saying that spending BTC as a currency will be GST exempt meaning you effectively get a discount for spending BTC? Because if it is the former then Singapore isn't taking the lead at all! A lot of countries already treat buying BTC as they would for any other currency exchange and several countries that did charge GST have already dropped it.

Not saying they aren't happening, but I am saying that all the potential solutions people are working on are just that, potential solutions.

Libra is VHS and bitcoin is betamax. In the real world it is marketing that wins, not technical superiority. But Libra has some smart people on board, their reserve will have BTC in it for sure IMO, it would not surprise me if the recent run up in price is Libra accumulating BTC for its reserve.
However, Libra doesn't do what bitcoin does so bitcoin isn't going anywhere, Libra might end up being more like a second layer scaling option (more like, not equal to) than a competitor.

Yes, to a certain extent since it makes the profit margin thin and the cost of hardware high it excludes a lot of small players. But there are still a lot of small players that get a few ASICs and join a mining pool. Technically the mining pool operator is in charge, but the small players can all just leave that pool whenever they want if the operator turns hostile or shady.

Here is something I have posted previously:
The use case is more like one-way transactions between 'bob' and 'coffee shop'. Bob opens a channel with his favourite coffee shop that he visits often, he puts into the channel enough BTC for 30 cups worth of coffee. That is a single on-chain transaction. Bob then proceeds to use that BTC to purchase a cup of coffee each morning, each time on the LN channel without any additional fees. Once all the balance is used up the channel gets closed (a second on-chain transaction). Bob has thus performed 30 transactions and only paid transaction fees for 2.
But that is a 1 to 1 channel, there is more flexibility in the system, if Bob wants to visit the bakery nearby that he almost never visits and therefore doesn't want a 1 to 1 channel, he can use the funds he put into the coffee shop channel if the coffee shop has a channel open with the bakery (and being next door they likely will), the cost of routing through the coffee shop will be something small like 1 satoshi.
One problem is that this will result in centralised LN hubs, but there will probably be so many hubs that is won't actually be a huge problem. I imagine 1 to 1 channels for things like a favourite coffee shop, the local supermarket, favourite hairdresser etc. You would then use hub services for less frequented shops, a shopping centre for example could be a hub service for all shops within it and then there might be much larger hub services for entire cities or entire states. It is cheaper to use a 1 to 1 channel, followed by the most localised hub, then the larger hubs which would likely link to the smaller hubs rather than 1 to 1 channels for every single shop. Say you use a city wide hub, that links to a shopping centre hub, that would be like the Bob -&gt; coffee shop -&gt; bakery but with an extra node Bob -&gt; city hub -&gt; shopping centre hub -&gt; shop and now you pay 2 satoshi.
Sound familiar? It should, we have it in various forms already, for example various wallet apps, starbucks rewards card, etc.

Possible? Maybe a serious bug or backdoor is discovered and pretty much everyone loses all confidence and declares the project dead and the price crashes to near 0 (would you actually jump on board here?). Then it turns out the problem wasn't so bad and gets fixed and confidence slowly trickles back. Likely? No.

It would basically mean that instead of an on-block transfer to you, you get an on-block transfer to a lightning channel between you and the exchange, you then basically need to route every payment through that exchange. So it should work pretty well if a lot of other people and businesses are also doing that. It makes the exchange a lightning hub and makes recharging the channel almost free since you could just essentially transfer that amount back and forth for as long as you like, buying it back every time.
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:57:23
The main detractors of bitcoin seem to know almost nothing about it from what I have seen.
You could easily increase the divisibility with layer 2 scaling with the caveat that settlement would only be allowed at the current 8 decimal places. But that addresses a case of a coffee costing for example 3.5 satoshi. The example of 1 sat being more than the average person could afford would be a problem. I don't see that happening though, bitcoin isn't and almost certainly never will be the only cryptocurrency.

Depends on the exchange, some facilitate user to user swaps and take a %, some just buy and sell with a large difference between buy and sell rate. There is little difference between the two models really, they both just boil down to buy low and sell high. The user to user swap method has lower risk and lower reward, the buy and sell at spot with a large price gap has a higher risk to reward ratio.

I don't know, maybe. If we reach a point where second layer tech has a well researched minimum block size and a single HF can fix it once and for all I expect it might be easier to gain user support.

Experience I guess. Picking the peak and trough is easy in hindsight, picking it when it hasn't actually happened yet is really, really hard.

Schnorr signatures allows for a single signature that proves ownership of all addresses. It would basically make all those 10-20 Kb exchange transactions into about 500 byte transactions. As for dust, adding an extra address adds something like 20-30 bytes to the transaction size which means most dust coins become spendable, only dust less than about 1000 sat would be useless.

Smart people know that the block size will need to be increased one day, but it is also totally obvious that just increasing the block size leads to a dead end. Why take a path that leads to a dead end simply because right now the dead end is not stopping you from walking? The block size can always be increased to the minimum required for a real scaling solution, but just blindly upgrading it now is a waste of time and resources since we don't know specifically what that requirement is yet.
So, all the work goes into finding real scaling solutions, look at how much time and energy BCH have wasted just trying to get everyone to accept a block size of 8 Mb. Meanwhile smart people are just working on finding real solutions.

Unlikely for 2 reasons. The most important being that most people use bank transfers which can't be a run on the banks (a run on the banks is when too many people try and withdraw cash and the bank runs out).

Is this true? AFAIK all the input addresses are still in the transaction, the only thing obfuscated is whether it is from a single sig or multisig. You can still trace inputs, the only thing it changes is to make things like coinjoin more desirable because it will make the transaction cheaper as well as increasing privacy.

Soft forks result in blocks that are still valid to old version nodes. Hard forks result in blocks that old version nodes reject causing a chain split. You can't increase the block size via a soft fork.

The 'they' you are referring to are the miners, development team (which is basically the same structure as anonymous because it refers to a different group of people at any one time and anyone can participate) and users. For any change to go through it needs to be agreed on by all. For example S2X failed because the users didn't like the backroom corporate meeting behind it.


E.g. they go after the development team and coerce them to take it down or else face severe consequences. Is my reasoning here correct, if not, please explain.
Your reasoning isn't correct. It is like saying if 'they' can put up torrent sharing then it can also be taken down. But it hasn't been taken down, it can't be taken down because it is decentralised and you would need to take it down on every computer it is on to stop it and that is just not practical.

Sort of (but mostly no) .... People mining above market value will have incentive to not sell those coins which will reduce the supply and help keep the price up, but if the price stays below their cost for long enough they will go broke and have to sell lowering the price a little and leaving the mining to those who get cheaper electricity.

The wording of that sounds a little flippant. Those seed words are the most important thing. If someone gets the seed words then they have full access to the bitcoin. If you lose the electrum installation then you can restore using the seed words. They shouldn't just be 'around the house', they need to be stored very securely in a place that they won't be lost. A second backup of the seed words in a different secure location could also help in case of a natural disaster that destroys your house and computer.

Mimblewimble can't be applied to bitcoin without essentially just scrapping the btc system and replacing it. That would be controversial and result in a hard fork with some people staying with the original bitcoin system and some swapping to the mimblewimble system and causing a lot of fighting.  Schnorr and taproot on the other hand are compatible and can be done with a softfork which allows co-existence of those that want to use it and those that don't, like how you can choose to use legacy addresses or segwit now.

The blockchain is a permanent record, those coins (UTXO) can be traced all the way back to the block that created them, a KYC exchange easily adds a name, but the number and type of transactions after that can make it more difficult to keep track of. IP address of the transaction can be tracked since it goes wallet &gt; node &gt; node &gt; etc. but that is not something the average person can see.


No way to tell, unless the online wallet mixes those UTXO with other address that are known to be tied to it.


No way to tell, unless the user mixes those UTXO with other addresses that are known to belong to them.
I guess the TL:DR is don't mix UTXO if you want to maximise privacy.


Yes, the master public key can generate all addresses for that HD wallet. So anyone that know the master public key knows exactly how much bitcoin you have and can watch all of the addresses tied to it. Don't give out a master public key.

Last I heard is that tether is backed 0.7:1, not the 1:1 that it is supposed to be and enough to make me want to have zero exposure to any tether or any exchange that heavily uses it. But, not enough of a problem to scare me away from bitcoin. If tether implodes it will hurt bitcoin, but it won't kill bitcoin. It is pretty clear to anyone that has been watching that bitcoin isn't about to die, not from bugs, not from mining backdoors, not from attempted corporate takeovers, and probably not from tether.

Different nodes can have different mempools depending on their settings. What happens if a node sees a block and doesn't have the transaction in its mempool? What happens if the mempool gets spammed to the point that a large portion of nodes run out of memory? does the whole network shut down? Does it continue and the spammed nodes just assume that the other nodes checked the block and accept it anyway?
Maybe your idea could work, but the current way bitcoin's mempool works allows for a number of attack vectors that could kill the whole thing. Spamming the mempool is almost free.

What stops a malicious miner adding a transaction where they send a bunch of nonexistent bitcoin to an address they own? Since none of the nodes have the transaction history there is no way to know that the block contains fraudulent transactions, it means we have to trust the miners, but anyone can mine. It won't work.
The closest thing to what you are thinking is mimblewimble which prunes Genesis -&gt; X -&gt; Y -&gt; Z -&gt; A down to Genesis -&gt; A. But, as soon as I heard the first implementation of that had a CEO I was out. It isn't perfect of course since nothing stops anyone from keeping the original information Genesis -&gt; X -&gt; Y -&gt; Z -&gt; A in their own database.

@_date: 2019-11-05 02:05:03
Yes and no. Most people pay 1-5 sat/byte, so as the price increases the value of those sat increase too. However, the minimum fee you can pay is ZERO (nothing at all), but that is unlikely to get included since the system has fee competition so miners add in the transactions that pay the most. The minimum non-zero fee is 1 satoshi (not 1 sat/byte), but few wallets have the option to set a fee that isn't in the sat/byte format.

@_date: 2019-11-15 08:21:18
You completely missed my point or don't understand how bitcoin works.
Bitcoin works by miners individually choosing which transactions they add into a block, this can include their own personal transactions including transactions that have not been sent to or relayed by any other node. The new block is then sent out to nodes and the nodes check the inputs and outputs of the new block to make sure that they are consistent with the history of inputs and outputs that already exist. If a miner adds a fraudulent transaction into a block that they mine then all the nodes they send it to can check against the known ledger of inputs and outputs, see the fraudulent transaction and reject the block.
In your example, no nodes can see the inputs of any transactions, so they can't even detect if a miner is being fraudulent. It requires trust of miners and that is just stupid!

This is incorrect. The security is from the signing method, ECDSA, a cryptographic method of proving you have the private key without revealing the private key itself.

Rdiculously oversimplified, but yeah I guess you could say that.
When it is decentralized then each copy of the database is controlled by a different entity, to change it you would need to gain access to computers all over the world simultaneously. Governments don't have that much reach and hackers don't have that much sunchronous reach.
If all those computers are controlled by a single entity then that entity is the weak point.
In a large decentralized network, how do you make sure everyone keeps and works on the most up to date copy of the database? That is where mining comes in one of the big innovations of bitcoin.

So people would definitely be looking, there isn't some secret flaw built in that just hasn't been found yet, maybe some new maths that trivialises finding the private key, who knows, unlikely though.

Windows is notoriously bad and the most used, so most viruses are for windows, like almost ALL of them. Mac can get viruses, I think I remember hearing about the first one a few years back, but because of the way the OS is designed it has almost no attack routs, same for linux, both of which are based on unix. Nothing is truly safe, but windows is truly fucked.

I suspect that the run up in price we saw from 4k is Libra Networks LLC accumulating BTC into their reserve, and the partner with Winklevii and Coinbase is just a method of doing that through a combination of OTC purchase and by allowing Libra to be bought directly with BTC. I expect Libra will be very successful. Don't be the idiot that uses BTC to buy Libra and everything will be fine. Libra is a stablecoin, any appreciation in value will be given as dividends to the backing companies.

I guess we have interpreted "Once the Libra network launches" differently and agree it is a bit ambiguous, does it mean the cryptocurrency or the group of companies? You appear to think it hasn't launched yet and means the cryptocurrency, while I think that is most certainly has and is the group.
Yes it is all very shady, the whole thing was kept quiet while they figured how to profit using bitcoin as an example, they launched with enough decentralisation to avoid any government having full jurisdiction to shut them down (except maybe Switzerland, but they are going to suddenly crack down on banking after all this time?) but also enough KYC etc to satisfy regulation of individual governments. By the time they launched, it was already too late to stop them, this gap period for launching the actual cryptocurrency is just a show and gives them some time to see if they overlooked any regulation that could kill them.
Two votes out of 100 isn't going to make any difference, they are structured like a cartel, a lot of those founding companies are pretty close friends with each other. Legally no single person or company is in control, behind the scenes it is probably Suckerberg and his friends that actually call all the shots, that is just speculation and no one can prove it.

Try and host an ETH node, look what happened to the ETH blockchain under the load of cryptokitties. Look at the price of ETH in USD and compare to the price of BTC for this recent run up, look at the price of ETH in BTC. Maybe it doesn't go to 0, but it is a significant uncertainty in your bet there. This current run up in price is slaughtering shitcoins, maybe that changes, maybe it doesn't, my money is on it not changing. But by placing your bet in an ETH contract you are also betting that ETH doesn't drop, and that is a bad bet because it is still dropping right now.

Bitcoin is open source code on [














Anyone can use it. Anyone can propose a change, but that change then needs to be checked and accepted and then it needs all users to update their node, it is a true democracy. Segwit is a great example, the majority of users wanted segwit, so we got segwit. Some people with selfish interests didn't want segwit so they forked off and made their own version with big blocks and no segwit, everyone gets what they want (sort of, BCASH wanted to take over bitcoin, but they didn't get that because most people didn't want their centralised shit).

Nodes validate and store the blockchain, they receive and validate new blocks and if they are valid send them to other nodes. Nodes are a vital part of the security of bitcoin, if only one node existed it could be hacked and the whole system destroyed. Each node adds one extra copy of the blockchain that would need to be destroyed to kill bitcoin, many nodes are the decentralization of bitcoin.
Nodes do not collect fees though, so there would be no direct financial gain from running a node.

You could have at least done some basic research. ASICs are already roughly on par (like maybe 2-3x difference compared to the 1000-1000000x difference if you compared it to a basic CPU/GPU) with what is expected from quantum computers. The problem lies in the cryptography, and that problem is shared by pretty much every aspect of internet security, which means everyone will work on it and a solution that can be applied to bitcoin will be found fast. A quantum computer is expected to be fast enough to calculate the private key from a broadcast transaction (using the signature) quick enough to broadcast a new transaction with a higher fee that sends the bitcoin to a different address.

No, you don't have an account. The bitcoin will be at that address in the blockchain ledger that exists as identical copies on every bitcoin node in the world. The private key is required to sign a transaction that then spends the bitcoin from that address. Anyone with the private key can do that. If you lose the private key then you lose the ability to spend that bitcoin.

Yes, bitcoin is a distributed ledger, a large number of nodes scattered all over the world is **how** it is a distributed ledger. Running multiple versions of software within the network also means that any one vulnerability will not kill the whole network.


If 90% of the user nodes did not allow that then those blocks would get rejected and the miners would basically be wasting their time. It would cause a chain split, but the miner chain with double reward would not get used by anyone so it would be worthless.

2140 is not being very honest with regards to mining incentive, people really need to stop using that figure. Look at the chart ([ just adding 4 years per halving can get you a pretty reasonable estimate. By 2036 the block reward is 0.390, by 2040 0.195, by 2044 0.098. 2140 is the point it reaches absolute zero, but it reaches zero economic viability much, much sooner than that.

When you say wallet what do you mean? Most people understand wallet to a HD wallet that generates multiple addresses, knowing one address to that wallet does not let you figure out what the other addresses are (unless the user has linked them in a transaction, but then you would still only know the linked addresses and none of the others).


This makes no sense. The only thing you can know is a public address and you cant send BTC without knowing it, plus the act of sending it forever stores that information in the blockchain. Bitcoin is pseudonymous (not anonymous, since addresses can and do get linked to the people/companies that own them, KYC exchanges for example). You can watch public address B and see when the BTC move, but if it just moves to some new address you wont know if the owner of B gave the BTC to someone else or if they just sent it to another address they also own.
@_date: 2018-06-03 00:13:39
Yeah dude, that is the point of a seed, all the addresses from the HD wallet are derived FROM that seed. If anyone gets the seed they can drain the whole wallet. You can have that seed on as many wallets as you want.

It would take more than one government, USA plus the whole EU could probably do it, and it would not be extremely easy to do. It would be very difficult and costly to do.
Here is a scenario that I think could work, at least in the short term. First they would need to increase the hash rate by several fold while accumulating huge amounts of bitcoin. Then make bitcoin illegal and announce the shut down all on- and off-ramps. Then as a lot of people start to panic they turn off all the hash power slowing block finding to a crawl and start dumping onto the market hard which causes a flash crash and scares away a lot of people. But, as they crash the market they also buy all of the bitcoin being dumped, wash trading their own bitcoin and accumulating everyone elses. They then use that hash power that they turned off to attack the network and cause chaos. At the end they control most of the bitcoin and own a huge amount of machinery that is now useless and have paid a lot of money to buy all that bitcoin which is now close to worthless.
That is a huge fucking effort and a LOT of money and it would not be a secret. Voters are pissed that so much money was wasted to do this and bitcoiners are pissed that the governments went to such lengths to kill bitcoin, it doesn't help them get voted back in next election. Not to mention the level of collusion required not only within each government but between governments of different countries is something so rarely seen that I doubt we would see it for something as controversial as bitcoin.
TL:DR Governments killing bitcoin is theoretically possible, but practically impossible.

All hardware wallets use software, all software wallets use hardware. The difference is that when people say hardware wallet they mean a dedicated device that is supposed to keep the private keys shielded from the OS that it is plugged into. A software wallet still needs to run on your hardware, so your computer or phone, these are a little less secure because they are more exposed to the internet, depending on your settings. So yeah, pretty much all software wallets give you sole ownership of your keys.

Blockchain is very low efficiency, it takes a lot of resources to maintain a decentralised network and the advantage is security and immutability. Private keys that give the bearer sole access to the asset on the blockchain are great for being censorship resistant and unconfiscatable, the trade-off is that if the sole bearer loses the private key then the asset is lost forever, there is no one that can reset your password (seed). 
Very few things would actually benefit from this, property? you want to be able to lose the password to your house permanently?

Yes it does.   
Partial repost of the above \^
(He first sent this article [ then followed up with this reply when someone told him he had no idea what he just read)
"There was a big scaling debate and in the end there were two sides. Those that wanted to scale using bigger blocksize (short term solution that doesn't work long term and also causes more centralization) vs those who wanted to scale using changes in the code to make the network more efficient aka SEGWIT+second layer scaling solutions (bitcoin becomes massive settlement layer, and second layer solutions can take care of verifying your $3.25 coffee payment).
On the big block side you had (most) miners because they were only able to see the short term benefits of increased blocksize and they do not care about network centralization. Also, a chinese miner controlling a sizeable chunk of the network's hashrate had access to (and was in the process of patenting) this technology called ASICBOOST which is an exploit in bitcoin code that allows you to "cheat" and get extra hashing power out of your miners. Essentially they had an unfair advantage and the KEY is that the segwit upgrade fixes this exploit. Alongside these miners you had a couple of misguided (but incredibly wealthy because of early adoption) individuals who either have a reason to see bitcoin fail (like they are heavily invested in altcoins now) or they are too pigheaded to back down when wrong (or some of them I'm sure are not actually intelligent enough to understand they are wrong).
On the Segwit side you had all the core developers (the guys who worked side by side with satoshi to build all this and have been contributing to the code for years every day), the majority of the userbase, AND the vast majority of bitcoin companies. The two sides were basically arguing over who had control over bitcoin - was it the miners, or was it the users? Was it those who chose which software to run (users) or was it those who verified transactions for that software (miners)? (The answer as you will see shortly is Users). So basically these miners were stalling the upgrade because it would mean the end of their unfair (AND patented) advantage. This massive stalemate in the debate caused a community led uprising known as the User Activated Soft Fork movement (UASF). These guys basically said "We're switching our nodes to Segwit software starting Aug 1 and we will be rejecting all mined blocks that do not comply with the new code". This forced the miners' hand as they realized they would either be forked off the network or have to go along with the new upgrade to make sure everything continued to go smoothly (including their profits).
The movement gained enough support to freak out some big money bitcoin CEOs who got together in a room with the miners and made a deal behind closed doors known as the New York Agreement (NYA). This is where Segwit2x was born. The key to note here is that not a single core dev was invited to this meeting (in fact, not a single competent dev in general was invited). The terms of the deal were: You guys agree to implement Segwit now, and then we'll agree to an increase in block size later (November). Deal was made and obviously the majority of the user community was in an uproar because bitcoiners hate closed door deals (and they should for good reason).
That being said, it got Segwit activated because it gave miners an easy way to safe face and go with segwit and the community instead of seeing their profits get wrecked by a messy chainsplit. However, do you remember that sneaky miner who had patented the ASICBOOST technology? Well he was part of the NYA and he decided to fork off anyway and create Bitcoin Cash. So stop right here and realize that the only reason we have bitcoin cash is so that some miner with a ton of hashing power could keep his unfair advantage over the network (he stills mainly mines bitcoin by the way because he would go out of business if he switched entirely to bitcoin cash). Also at this point, technically the NYA was broken because the whole point of it was to avoid a chainsplit and go with segwit followed by a block size increase whereas bitcoin cash was a clear chainsplit.

SW vs HW is kind of a silly comparison, you need both. HW wallets still use software and SW wallets still use HW (computer or phone). The real comparison is hot vs cold, the whole point of a HW wallet is that the device spends the majority of its life NOT connected to the internet and when it is connected does so in a secure manner. The typical SW wallet spends most of its time on a connected device which means it is a potential target for hackers all or almost all of the time. You can have an offline wallet just using a cheap computer that is never connected to the internet where you can sign a transaction and copy it to an online computer to be broadcast to the network, dedicated HW wallets are just way more convenient.

It depends on too many variables. How many people will just post a middle price fee anyway vs how many people will post a fee high enough to get into the next block. If it turns out that most people still post mid level fees then the cartel's fees will all form the next block and if they lose it to a non cartel miner then all those fees get lost and could easily eat any profit from the spam attack. Eventually they would probably lose. And if the non cartel miners could identify the spam transactions they could put them all into their blocks and really hurt the attack. Bitcoin is already designed to be resistant to this kind of thing.

It's talking about cognitive bias. Once someone accepts an idea, they become emotionally invested in it. The longer they hold that idea as true the less logically they can think about it. If someone has built their entire life and career around a certain idea, they are not changing their mind, it doesn't matter how much evidence is presented. Only the next generation, able to view the evidence without any bias can then take up the idea.
That is a gross generalization that explains a group effect, obviously there are people that don't invest emotionally in ideas and can change their mind more freely.

"This includes changes such as introducing Schnorr signatures, using key recovery to shrink signature sizes, supporting sidechains, or creating even smarter contracts by using Merklized Abstract Syntax Trees (MAST) and other research-level ideas."
SegWit does make those things much easier to implement, but those things are almost unrelated to side chains (they help a little). Schnorr signatures and MAST will help reduce the size of transactions.


While it is possible you could propose a side chain system that would allow fractional reserve, nothing under serious consideration right now would allow for that sort of system. For example LN basically places some bitcoin into an escrow account, you update which member owns how much in a time locked manner then close the escrow account, you can't use anything that doesn't exist on-chain.


"The limitation of segregated witness and its ability to introduce sidechains to bitcoin removes the key aspects of scarcity from the system. The change of bitcoin from a cash and payment system into a limited settlement system alters the fundamental nature of the environment and the economics of the system. Introducing sidechains leads to a scenario where bitcoin becomes the capital control system for a large fiat based environment. The proposed limitations associated with sidechains cannot be enforced. there is no way to ensure the one-to-one pegging of each bitcoin. More importantly there is no reason for this to exist as a solution. If each individual unit can be used on chain, we come to the realisation that we have not actually achieved any cost savings.
This leads to the sole solution that can logically follow. That is an initial small amount of bitcoin will end up propping large quantities of values held within sidechains. This introduces fractional reserve banking into bitcoin and destroys the scarcity factor. Without scarcity, bitcoin may as well be PayPal or any bank or credit system. Once we start to realise that it is scarcity that makes bitcoin valuable, and that coupled with the ability to trade quickly, safely, and across borders, we start to understand that any addition to the protocol that removes scarcity, and lowers the velocity, will limit the value that can be traded market. "
Bitcoin Cash wins!

You are now adding 2 new premises, 1. people wanting it (high demand) and 2. a shortage existing (low supply). Neither of those are actually linked to the cost for anyone except the person incurring the cost. If either of those two new premises are violated, people stop wanting it, or everyone decides to sell now at whatever the spot price is, then the cost gets borne only by the person that directly incurs it.
How about this example then: shale oil. It wasn't extracted when the cost of oil was low, because the cost of production doesn't add value.

Unlikely since the malware version just uses a preset set of seed words that the hacker also has. The result is a second transaction as soon as any fund enter the hacked wallet that transfers the BTC to an address only the hacker owns. OP's BTC went to a totally different address than what Electrum showed, this is the MO of a clipboard virus, and OP already confirmed it by trying again and the address again getting swapped after copying.

Not true. The price isn't some magical thing that happens outside of human action, it is caused BY human action. If everyone thinks the price will rise then they will all act in a way that directly or indirectly causes that to happen. If everyone thinks it will fall then that is how they will act. So a lot of people expecting a correction is important.

Countries where currencies collapse don't just cease to have transactions, they simply use a different, more stable currency. Zimbabwe right now still mostly uses USD for example. If you continued to hold Zimbabwean dollars you ended up with nothing, if you held something that kept its value then you held on to your wealth. Bitcoin is like gold in that its value is not tied to a single currency so it offers a hedge against currency losses (QE for example) or a collapse (Zimbabwe for example).

That is not what a technical talk sounds like. The alice example is just flat out wrong and the numbers that needs to be locked up is just him hand waiving about numbers, at no point does he make a well thought out argument about it.
Here is what a real technical talk looks like:
At about 55 seconds he talks about on-chain scaling, it should be painfully obvious why this is not a viable solution. So any increase at all right now is just blindly following a path that ultimately leads to failure. We need real scaling options.

The price variation in exchanges between countries reflect the ease and cost of currency conversion between them and probably some other factos.

These aren't facts you are talking about. Money is a social construct and it can change. Is the system of perpetual debt really the best system we can possibly have? There seem to be a lot of problems, no?

@_date: 2017-11-22 06:17:02
Exactly, (although for price the current market supply is the deciding factor and bitcoin has almost none since people buy and hold) supply and demand is the most important thing, the cost of production is only relevant to the person that incurs it, it doesn't add value. Cost of production simply identifies the minimum price point at which production ceases to be profitable and therefore ceases to happen.
If a gold miner could prove that s/he was mining gold at a cost that is currently 2x the price of gold, it would just make that person bad a business, it wouldn't make the gold actually worth more.

No, because of the gold that has already been mined at a cheaper price can still be sold by people that haven't incurred that higher cost.
Seriously, who cares is a miner pays that much for 12.5 bitcoin when there are already millions of other bitcoin that are already on the market. The increased cost of those 12.5 bitcoin doesn't make them worth more than the coins already in existence.

But a growing economy is just recruiting new people into the pyramid scheme, when there aren't any new people you get a situation like Japan, an aging population, negative interest and a recession.

The original post that HODL comes from was talking about not being able to time the market very well to buy low and sell high so just hold through the dips and peaks. Not using it as a currency was never mentioned, maybe it has gained that definition now, but it originally did not mean never sell or use, it just meant never sell. So spend and replace and HODL should be compatible, not mutually exclusive.

Your scenario requires governments and banks to  basically go "welp, we had a good run, let's let bitcoin become the global currency without a fight"
IMO the most likely situation is government controlled cryptocurrencies, at least for major governments. In that world bitcoin exists as a precious, rare savings currency and maybe to convert between currencies.
The entire world would have to go to utter complete shite before bitcoin becomes the main global currency, It would have to get so bad that even bitcoin may not survive.
So 1 million bitcoin that may or may not be lost is almost inconsequential. So much will be lost by some point.

This is a hard fork, it literally splits the bitcoin community


This is the opposite to the above....
@_date: 2018-02-11 10:02:17
Right now you have to use a signature per UTXO, if you periodically transfer small amounts to a paper wallet, each of those amounts are a UTXO even though it is a single address. You could end up with a huge transaction that will incur a large transaction fee.
Don't store BTC on an exchange, but keeping BTC you intend on trading is generally ok, especially for small amounts like that.
@_date: 2017-09-16 00:33:32
I know, but the point I was making was that backing any form of cryptocurrency (even a state endorsed one) also legitimizes bitcoin. Governments and banks could release a distributed network where they control all the nodes and thus are still able to control the currency. But all that does is drastically increase the cryptocurrency user base.
@_date: 2018-02-20 01:27:15
The best you can get is to look at BTC distribution across addresses, sometimes 1 address is owned by a large group of people, also most people have multiple addresses. So basically no.

Also, most of the big devs use Harry Potter pseudonyms. The best thing I like about MimbleWimble is that they really wanted to apply it to BTC for the longest time and only decided to make their own coin when it became apparent that applying to BTC right now was impossible.
@_date: 2017-09-22 06:52:10
The fastest way to completely destroy bitcoin is to get into a mind set where hard forks are the way to solve disagreements. If bitcoin is to go mainstream then it can't split like this. Who is going to use a currency that splits all the time?
e.g. BT1 and BT2, but then BT2 has a disagreement and splits into BT2.1 and BT2.2. And what happens when those groups disagree?
It is still early days so the price will rise with increased adoption regardless of an early hard fork that effectively gets around the 21 million hard limit. BUT, how can there be mass adoption with a history of a hard fork every time there is a disagreement? The coin needs to be stable for mass adoption, and nobody buys the "this time will be different" line when there is a long history that says otherwise.
Great care needs to be taken to avoid hard forks being accepted as the way to solve disagreements. People say shedding the dissenters just makes bitcoin stronger, but it doesn't at all. If even this small a number of users can't make bitcoin work then how can anyone legitimately expect a large portion of the entire world to make it work?

We will see it as cryto fiat, it will happen IMO, all miners will be government / central bank controlled and at least the majority of nodes will be too.

Bitcoin is gambling in the sense that stocks are gambling. They both have an inherent risk for loss and they both have a chance to give rewards. Some people call it gambling, some people call it investment. The difference between casino style gambling and investment style gambling is that at the casino there are people actively trying to make you lose, with investments there are people actively trying to make the investment (and therefore you) win. Thus bitcoin is an investment because the people behind are actively trying to make it succeed.

@_date: 2017-09-22 07:03:57
Thinking too short term, think long term when the price is stable. If bitcoin is worth 21 trillion USD dollars (for the sake of easy math, 1 million each) and splits, that 21 trillion USD is now split between 42 million coins. Again for easy math, its value splits evenly, now everyone has two coins, but the same amount of value, neither of which will increase because there are no new users to increase its value. Technically there are still only 21 million bitcoins, but the value was just halved, so in reality there are 42 million, calling the new 21 million something else is just a technicality.
Who wants that? Isn't one of the benefits being a single global currency?
But this is still early days, how many splits would it take between now and 1 million USD per bitcoin before everyone decides not to even get on board.

Still not looking far enough ahead. If a precedent of a HF to solve a disagreement is set then where will bitcoin be in 10 years? At mass adoption level the value will be pretty stable, so any HF will not result in any increase in value for either chain, but would just split the current value across smaller chains. You would need to know which forked coin to dump, or face getting burned. Such a system would not get adopted. So every HF delays mass adoption, how many HF will it take to completely stop mass adoption. No one buys the "this time will be different, honest" line, so we need to avoid a history of multiple HF.

The combined price of the two split coins equals the price of the original coin plus or minus the market's reaction to the split.

There are two options: just hold both coins and wait for the winner OR try and profit by selling the losing chain, if you choose wrong you could lose almost everything. My plan is to wait until there is replay protection and a clear winner is chosen and then dump the loser (the value at that time will be much lower than at the split, but hopefully still above 0).

Those are already solved. Battery storage, molten salt etc. It doesn't need to always work at full capacity because of the storage factor which can output at night and during peak demand times. The tesla power wall can also be programmed to feed the power grid at times of peak energy demand resulting in a distributed power supply.
Also silver is not a requirement in all solar cells, it just happens to be in the current best ones. Research is ongoing, honestly, when have humans collectively failed to innovate out of a problem? Why are you betting that we will fail now? It's not my 'dumb idea', also it isn't dumb.
Copper? We already transmit energy, the amount of copper required would be to link the new solar + battery stations to the current grid, i.e. not much.
What do you mean all around the world? You think we would need to send the energy from one side of the planet to the other? That IS nonsense I agree, but that is why battery farms are a thing.

Solar will be to that scale for the whole world, not just bitcoin mining. Governments are already building large solar farms and battery facilities to replace coal plants that are getting decommissioned, that trend will continue and accelerate. In addition, we are starting to see distributed solar + battery combos in the form of solar roof tops and the tesla power wall.
We won't be all solar tomorrow, obviously, but eventually dirty energy sources will be a minority. My point is that isn't a problem bitcoin needs to solve, market forces are already heading towards the solution.

re-read the title of this thread then.

Bitcoiners are like  what? 0.001% of the population right now? Less? Are governments really going to just go "welp, 0.001% of the population don't want us to do this, guess we wont then"? No chance.
Governments don't like bitcoin but probably will like blockchain. They might solve our scaling problem for us by making their own crypto. Bitcoin to store and atomic swap to government cryptofiat for spending.

There are a lot of dinosaurs stuck in the past that are currently in positions of power. But progress is being made in spite of their efforts. The battery facilities that Tesla are installing now are helping solar go main stream. Musk actually tweeted to the Australian government that he could have a battery facility up and running within 100 days or it would be free, the government signed up and that is currently ahead of schedule. I am enthusiastic, mostly because I can see it taking hold.
I am equally enthusiastic about bitcoin, because I can see cryptocurrencies and blockchain taking hold. Bitcoin will have a very solid position in a world where everyone uses cryptocurrencies. How or if its array of current problems get solved will dictate what exactly that position is, I don't know, but even in its current form it would make a solid store of value safe from inflationary government crypto.

IMO bitcoin is the poster child of blockchain tech. If blockchain uptake stalls then bitcoin fades into obscurity. If blockchain uptake goes global, and right now that is a real possibility (look at Quorum and the Ethereum alliance, digital rupee, plus large investments from Japan and Russia and rumour that China is planning its own cryptocurrency), then bitcoin goes global. It's open source, any wallet can store any currency and conversion is super easy. I see investing in bitcoin as a bet that this tech is the future. The first super limited cryptocurrency isn't going to lose value in a world where everyone uses crypto.
But, I really can't see bitcoin as the dominant currency.  I expect banks and governments to release their own currencies at a supply rate they control using a distributed network where they own the majority of hash power.

Is this actually a bill that will harm bitcoin disguised as a bill that favours bitcoin? (At first I thought it was good, but the more I think about it, it is not so good)
If you buy 1000 Euro and go and spend it on vacation in Europe, even if the dollar tanked at that time you don't pay capital gains tax. If you buy 1000 Euro with USD and then sell it realising a gain of 20% you do pay capital gains tax. In other words, the law already recognises (edit: would already recognize if bitcoin was considered a foreign currency) the difference between buying bitcoin and using it as a currency and buying bitcoin and using it as a capital gains investment.
This bill actually kills the ability to make large purchases with bitcoin for early investors (without paying huge amounts of tax), which you will absolutely want to do if bitcoin truly become successful. It also makes bitcoin use more complicated since you will need to calculate any gains for large purchases even if those gains are just a few dollars from bitcoin you purchased just a few weeks ago.
We need the government to recognise that bitcoin should simply be covered by the existing regulations.
edit: having read this response further down: "The bill ultimately seeks to subject digital currency to a similar tax regime to that of foreign currency." maybe it is just the start of a good thing?

I was intentionally vague with 'pretty heavily'. I don't know what % is actually linked to new users, but there has been a huge number of new accounts getting made on the exchanges, so it is very likely part of the price rise. However, if those investors are new then they fall into the 'new user' category. Bitcoin is not just a money, if it was just another money it would not be revolutionary, it fills multiple roles at once, that is part of what makes it special IMO. A new investor is still a new user as they are using bitcoin for one of its multiple roles.

I agree the LN white paper example sucks. The use case is more like one-way transactions between 'bob' and 'coffee shop'. Bob opens a channel with his favourite coffee shop that he visits often, he puts into the channel enough BTC for 30 cups worth of coffee. That is a single on-chain transaction. Bob then proceeds to use that BTC to purchase a cup of coffee each morning, each time on the LN channel without any additional fees. Once all the balance is used up the channel gets closed (a second on-chain transaction). Bob has thus performed 30 transactions and only paid transaction fees for 2.
But that is a 1 to 1 channel, there is more flexibility in the system, if Bob wants to visit the bakery nearby that he almost never visits and therefore doesn't want a 1 to 1 channel, he can use the funds he put into the coffee shop channel if the coffee shop has a channel open with the bakery (and being next door they likely will), the cost of routing through the coffee shop will be something small like 1 satoshi.
One problem is that this will result in centralised LN hubs, but there will probably be so many hubs that is won't actually be a huge problem. I imagine 1 to 1 channels for things like a favourite coffee shop, the local supermarket, favourite hairdresser etc. You would then use hub services for less frequented shops, a shopping centre for example could be a hub service for all shops within it and then there might be much larger hub services for entire cities or entire states. It is cheaper to use a 1 to 1 channel, followed by the most localised hub, then the larger hubs which would likely link to the smaller hubs rather than 1 to 1 channels for every single shop. Say you use a city wide hub, that links to a shopping centre hub, that would be like the Bob -&gt; coffee shop -&gt; bakery but with an extra node Bob -&gt; city hub -&gt; shopping centre hub -&gt; shop and now you pay 2 satoshi. 
Sound familiar? It should, we already have it in various forms already, for example various wallet apps, starbucks rewards card, etc. In many cases you might not even need the LN, you could just transfer funds into various wallet apps (which also have rewards points) and not even need the second on-chain transaction.

Yeah true, no one said it in this thread, but it does get thrown around a lot that bitcoin will replace fiat, I made the mistake of generalizing while replying to a specific comment. I don't see how our tax paying for a government/central bank blockchain is any different to our tax paying for all the money printing activities now.
As for trust, I am not sure what you are referring to specifically, individual transactions you still have the trust of the blockchain so you don't need to trust the other person. A government cryptofiat you can trust also (you can trust that it will be inflationary and manipulated, but easy to use everywhere). Bitcoin isn't trustless, right now you need a lot of trust that project remains on track, because a derailment could send the value to zero.
I agree it doesn't replace the need for bitcoin, it would actually help propel it to mainstream, if everyone is already using crypto, moving to bitcoin is easy. My prediction is government cryptofiat that you use for everyday purchasing, with bitcoin used by many people for value store, currency exchange and long distance transfer, etc., some people, and maybe even whole countries, may even just use it as their primary currency.

Nodes don't just blindly accept blocks, they validate them first by checking that the inputs and outputs are correct, if the block is invalid it gets rejected. This is why adding extra nodes increases the security of the network. A malicious block with invalid transactions, for example sending 10,000 bitcoin from an address that doesn't have 10,000 bitcoin or sending bitcoin without a correct signature, would simply be rejected. Furthermore, the miner that made the invalid block would then have wasted their time and not make any bitcoin, had they just mined a valid block they would get the block reward and miner fees.

Stop making shit up to argue against, of course bitcoin isn't going to fix the problem of wealth distribution. All I said was that inflation is from capitalism, not socialism.


This is a valid concern, but, if bitcoin reaches the final point of widespread adoption (i.e. the plateau of an S curve adoption) then the value increase it sees will be about the equivalent of leaving that money in a savings account. Savings accounts exist already and people still spend money to buy things.

Equal wealth distribution is something that comes from the top level of any system. Currencies are sub-level and simply adhere to the rules imposed by the system. The system is capitolism and it is basically just the feudal system that the USA founders sought to escape from, only without the noble titles and where the peasants are owned by debt and poverty. Bitcoin, or any currency, isn't going to fix this.

Hacking requires accessing over 51% of the distributed network and then still not even having a 100% success rate. It makes no difference if that network is owned by individual miners or one government.
Cannot be counterfeited (this is a big one).
Keeps a complete record of trades and ownership (what government isn't sold on this idea, even if this was the only benefit they would be all in; It would allow a way to automatically check if banks have the reserve that they are required to have).
Not to mention transactions could include all sorts of information. The blockchain could be open, partially open or private. Most money is digital now anyway, blockchain just makes it much easier and safer to track and work with.
Miner fees could represent inflation and transaction fees could represent tax, easy.

My expectation is that major governments will all introduce their own blockchain based cryptocurrencies (and we are already starting to see hints of this, India: Lakshmi, Dubai: EmCash). The only part of crypto not compatible with current fiat is the fixed amount of coins that stop governments/central banks from controlling flow.
If the governments/central banks own the entire mining network then they can set their own fee limits (in other words automate tax collection) and their own inflation by setting the block payout rate. A single organisation in control of the mining network can protect against chain splits while maintaining the safety of a distributed network (a hacker would need to access too many different mining nodes to be able to do anything). And the governments/central banks can then monitor all aspects of their currency and control it as needed.
Bitcoin has a very good place in such a scenario IMO. When everyone is using crypto, the founding limited supply crypto will be very rare and valuable.
It is ironic that in such a situation the anonymity aspect of current cryptos would be replaced with the ability of the government to know exactly where and how much you spend/own at all times.

This can happen, but you just cheated yourself out of the 12.5 BTC block reward and the fees for the following reasons.


All full nodes check that the transactions in each block valid and not fraudulent. If the transactions are invalid the block gets rejected, this means you do not get the block reward or the fees. So you spent all that time and electricity to get nothing.






Not possible because your fraudulent block was clearly fraudulent and immediately rejected.

Bitcoin is psudonymous, not anonymous. It is trivial for a government to link you to all (or at leas most) of your bitcoin. Almost every bitcoin purchase method right now requires ID. Governments will realize they actually like bitcoin more than fiat when it comes to tracking, I expect they will turn fiat into a cryptocoin (minus the limited amount of course), and bam, full purchase surveillance.
But truly mooning doesn't necessarily mean replacing government fiat, I doubt that will ever happen. It just means reaching the peak of the s-curve adoption, and that peak can be any % of the population, it might peak at 10% for example, who knows.
People worry about scaling to enable micropayments. The more I think about it, the less I think that is actually a problem. Look at things like LINE pay, Starbucks cards (which you can use via an app), and various other mobile wallet type apps, etc. They are basically the lightning network in action (a 1 to 1 channel without the rerouting option, but still), and have the benefit of rewards points automatically tied to the purchase. At the moment you can charge them using a bank transfer or exchanging cash at one of the stores (a push type charge) or link to a bank account or credit card to auto draw fund (a pull type charge, which is super risky IMO because if your account is compromised then the hacker can pull all your funds). One day you might be able to charge it by transferring bitcoin (push charge).

Nodes don't put transactions into blocks, miners do. Miners don't make blocks smaller, that isn't a thing, miners incorporate transactions into a block and send it to the network of nodes where it gets validated. Miners then start trying to make the next block that includes the header of the previous block, this links the blocks in a chain.

Selling pressure is matched by buying pressure, the questions is, who breaks first...

Who is selling now and why? Selling to buy back lower or selling because they need the cash...
Who is buying now? People that think this is close enough to the bottom already, people that know a lot of money is waiting ready to dive in, people that know if the price never gets low enough for all that money then it will FOMO in higher on the way up....

The way I see it we either saw manipulation where a whale made some big buys to cause a short squeeze so they can make a quick profit, in which case we can expect a big dump to a lower low within the next few weeks. OR
We saw a legit floor where sellers were getting exhausted and buyers found the price too good to pass up so the short squeeze was not from manipulation, but rather from some shorters realizing that the bottom was in and getting out, causing the short squeeze. If this is what happened then we are on the way to test the resistance at 12k.

Based on the lack of selling pressure at 6.8k and the strong buying pressure now. That's just my opinion, your scenario leading us to 4.5k  could easily happen, I just personally give it a lower probability than you do. But we are both just guessing so who knows.
If you were a whale and knew everyone was waiting for 3-5k prices before buying would you a) keep the price above that so they FOMO in at a much higher price than you bought; OR b) let the price reach that low and hope you can get in during the small window that is open?

Not really. Here is a list of corrections/improvements. Bob also needs to have a wallet. Alice doesn't send the money in step 2, she broadcasts a transaction to send the money, bob is not in possession of the money yet. Step 3 should be the transaction getting mined by a miner which includes it into the next block, only at this point has the money actually been received by bob. Step 4, 5 and 6 are part of the same thing: the newly mined block gets sent to all the nodes in the network and they independently validate it (hence the consensus part). If the block is invalid then all the nodes reject and the person(s) that made it get nothing but still used all that time and electricity.
Pool mining is just a way of combining computing power and sharing the reward, it doesn't really need a sub point.

Don't pay much attention to the market cap, that is how much the total coins are worth and even counts all the lost ones. The total number of coins that actually trade is just a fraction of the total that exist.
Here is a made up example: 1000 coins actively trade and the total coins that exist is 10000 (some are lost and the rest are in cold storage), the current price is 100, this makes the market cap 1 million. 10 of those coins sell bringing the price down to 90, now the market cap is 900k, but less than 1000 worth of coins traded.

Ah yes. You can not just upgrade a legacy wallet into a segwit wallet and keep the same seed words. You would need to make a new wallet with a new set of seed words and then either maintain two wallets or send from the legacy wallet to the segwit wallet. That is the incompatibility, sending from legacy to segwit addresses and back the other way however is fully compatible.
@_date: 2019-05-17 04:09:30
Sure is, put the seed words in a text file (can be encrypted also) in an encrypted usb (preferably using a fresh install OS that has and never will be connected online), but only works for cold storage. The benefit is that you can make multiple copies and it just looks like a regular usb rather than an hardware wallet screaming that you own bitcoin. To then spend them you need to load into a wallet which comes with the chance to screw up if you are hacked.

Bitfinex has btc settled shorts (i.e. you sell bitcoin at the current price and then buy it at a later date in the hope that it goes down) and these are publicly available ([ To exit the short position requires the entity to buy bitcoin at the current price, so a short squeeze is where the price goes above the initial buy price of a number of shorts and those people then have to close their positions by buying bitcoin which makes the price go up even more, potentially starting a chan reaction.
