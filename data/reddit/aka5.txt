After reading the comments, i realized most think its tax evasion, which caused the raid.
But, if he is SN and he owns a shitload of bitcoin, how does he evade taxes? - he could only evade them if he profits from it, but clearly the bitcoins haven't moved and so there was no gain, yet.
Can someone explain to me what the bitcoins, if he has them, have to do with taxes?

That makes me sick, to see real faces who get rubbed right in front of the camera, and the worst part it seems like these people are so hoping that it works and hoping for a better life, just to get frauded, it's a sick world.

Great comment from Erik.
And after reading the comments here on reddit it's exactly like Erik said "If you're actually reading this post, instead of just the headline and reddit comments, you have a longer attention span than many."
Almost all in here either didn't read Eriks article, or they did really not understand it.
Either way i guess i can't change the ignorance or their lack of understanding, or their to short attention span, so i'll better just leave it that way.
It's a really great article.

So first we introduce RBF (replace by fee), and then to force it, we change the "old coins can move for free" to "no coins can move for free", then we will wait for a few stuck transactions and everyone is happy we have RBF, right?

So i see a picture with a "฿ 50 000" on it - but what does it mean? Can someone explain?
Edit: ok i found  and now i guess i understand it, its a tv show where houses are sold, and there was an offer of 50k BTC for an house, am i right?!
@_date: 2015-06-21 10:09:08
So if that 1% is right, they'll mine about 36 BTC a day, not that bad.

I read it ... i guess it gave me a rough idea of the concept. But im not quite sure.
Advanced question, could something like that be adopted to be used to also encrypt DATA, for example like a last will? So you can timencode your last will and it makes sure in the future someone can read it, without the need of someone / something (for example a physical save) to keep it save for the future?!

I dont think there is a difference.
Its percentage - so if you invest 1000$ in btc @ 28$ and it drops 90% you will lose the same amount of $ as if you invest 1000$ in btc @ 15000$ and it drops 90% :)
@_date: 2016-11-28 05:16:03
It's like 900 $ BTC in india ... there are cheap things to fake - which could boost the price, because people belief what they read, instead of doeing theire own research ... like the 900 $ BTC in india everyone is hyping, and noone cares about the volume ...
if you want to pump the price, just manipulate such facts like exchange rates from an ~100 btc market a day, with self buys, tx amount with tx spam, and so on, in the end BTC price is news driven, so individuals will do everything they could to get theire own news :)

isn't the problem with neteller that a neteller transaction is reversible ? - so the bad actors will try to buy bitcoins with neteller and afterwards call neteller and tell them theire neteller account has been hacked - neteller will reverse the transaction, and the exchange gave the bitcoins to the bad actor for free ...
@_date: 2015-07-31 17:12:17
For example they could easy adopt the BTC ATM concept and sell and buy bitcoins in there WU offices (and profit from the margin, they could also automate this in the future and profit even more).
@_date: 2015-08-01 19:10:52
did BILD just educate people that bitcoins are somehow anonymous?
So the ones that are reading BILD (mostly not the educated ones), can now go and spend some bitcoins on the darkweb - because its anonymous - even police departments which got hacked and payed bitcoin to a ransomeware,  couldn't trace the bitcoins back after they payed?!! (conclution for the stupid ones - bitcoin must be anonymous!)
is that the message? :D

This sub is just an echo chamber, noone is checking facts (besides you in that case) and noone seems to be interested in facts, its just buy buy buy ... sell sell sell ... or blame blame blame.

All those lemmings, pretty funny.
If china bans bitcoin - everyone is saying something like "we don't want china to be involved, because its everytime the same with china ban, so let them just go for good, price will not go down, because china is irrelevant, i'm sure!"
And then after the tweet which says, hey it's only exchanges which are banned and not the miners, everyone is like: "yeah this will pump for sure, it's great to have china still on board, thank charlie for the pump news!"

sry but there is just nothing to see, yet.
They haven't even an client for it...

This seems not to make much sense ... if he DDoS your IP, whats the difference with using a VPN? That wouldn't change the fact that he still could DDoS your IP, you just have an additional IP with your VPN, but the IP from your ISP is still used, so he can still DDoS you.
It would make sense if you have had an dynamic IP and you stated you changed the IP so his DDoS will be useless until he gets your new IP (which you could obfuscate with your VPN).

Nice work keep it going
@_date: 2015-09-02 21:22:25
sry for bitching, but it looks like your transaction is depending on some 3rd party exchange wallet.
So you are not using bitcoin like intended (with your own keys), you have give the control of your funds to someone else, who did't set the appopriate fees - so can you blame bitcoin on this? or is it more like you have to blame bitx for not using the right fee to make your withdraw?
(perhaps you can talk to bitx support if they can resubmit the tx with a higher fee?!)

jeah mastercard your doing it right, fight bitcoin :) fight it until its too late and your business will die, than you'll realize you did it wrong, but than its too late - good luck.
Btw. deposit Bitcoin to neteller -&gt; transfer to pokerstars -&gt; cash out to neteller -&gt; clean funds for using NET+ card? --&gt; wait until they get it and they will tell neteller to completely forbid bitcoin :S

who the heck said bitpay as a payment processor failed?
(I still pay regular on many pages which use bitpay - nothing has changed!)

don't know how good that info on that page is, but i guess there are others, and it could be a start.

Until the coins move you can't do a thing, it's a new address, and so it could belong to anybody.
You have to wait until the coins move, if they move one possibility could be that you can trace them to a known exchange wallet and so you can perhaps get a track of the criminal.
@_date: 2015-10-19 19:20:07
haha thats what i thought, too :D
@_date: 2015-10-13 06:41:33
Did you try to rescan the blockchain?
(If the tx is not propagated to the network, i guess your client just thinks you spend it, but you didn't, so with a rescan your funds should be available again i guess.)

Im from germany, too, and under deposit the first option for me is bitcoin.

mister your looking at the wrong coin / explorer ... DASH is not DSH !
@_date: 2015-10-13 05:38:36
So one more thing ... if there is mixing in progress in an DASH block, it will be 1 transaction - but look closer, this transaction got multiple ins and outs ... these ins and outs are the mixing participants (one participant can have 1 to n ins/outs from this mixing transaction there is no way to tell, but the mixing progress would not start if just one wallet is trying to mix and no other wallets are there to participate at the same time, because like you said it doesn't makes much sense to just mix with yourself)
sry im not good in explaining but perhaps this gives a bit more information of what you are seeing in the blockexplorer.
(A good starting point for more information would be the wiki, or the whitepaper ( or if your more the experimantal guy, perhaps just use the DASH testnet to get an idea of how its working).

"Am I reading their explorers incorrectly?" -&gt; you are looking at the wrong coin / explorer !
Ouch ... DSH = DASHCOIN its not DASH / DARKCOIN ...

You are right, you can't prove that. That's the point about Peter Todd's "snake oil".
I really don't get why people just won't use their own brain cells when it comes to investing their own money...
@_date: 2015-10-06 20:08:22
Im also using them and its working like a charm!
(They use bitpay as bitcoin payment processor).
Only disadvantage in paying with btc - you can't obtain more than one ipv4 per instance ... they changed that recently (with other payment methods you can still add up to 2 additional ips per instance).

@_date: 2015-10-13 10:50:21
It's the normal human being, throw horseshit if it's good for your cause ... so perhaps you should not only ask for a proof about that NSA claim, but you should also ask for a proof that Peter Todd is not invested in monero for example, before you call the one thing horseshit and the other as "truth"....

Its about 6% gain for everyone who wants to bet on an fine outcome for finex.
Just buy some btc send them to finex and cash out hard usd from finex - as long as finex usd withdraws are working, you get about 6% everytime.
