Did you have a chance to look through? Still no further with it

I've tried multiple samples and had no luck, there have been a few comments comments stating the same error in the linked guide in my post so not sure if this is the issue, are you able to replicate it from this guide? The primary xpub I am trying to use is from the latest version of Electrum, fresh wallet.

Same issue, it looks to be a change that was made in the repo within the last ~9  months maybe? I know nowhere near enough about this to understand what is going on and find a solution though, thanks for taking the time to respond here

I don't want to use anything third party unfortunately and the application is too small to opt for running a full node, so I am left with needing to derive the addresses myself from the xpub key.

I'd want to do this server side via php

It is a personal site I just wanted unique btc addresses for donations and this seemed like a perfect solution rather than having a full node running. Could you please check if your version is still running ok? If so I'd love you to send over your code so I can compare it and see if it is an issue with the HD.php code or the library code itself

The exception is thrown from here:

    throw new \InvalidArgumentException('Invalid fingerprint for BIP32 key, must be in range [0 - (2^31)-1] inclusive');

$parentFingerprint is 0 when I echo it

Please try to debug if you have the knowledge, I can make the reward $200, desperate to have this solved, been trying everything and refreshing reddit constantly lmao

This is possible through PHP alone so I would want to do so, I just don't know what was changed in the repo which has broken this method, would not like shell_exec enabled on the server so can't use anything command line based, would also not want to use a third party for it, thank you for the suggestions though!

I have the latest version, but considering using an older version to see if it works. Have tried all sorts of alterations though and it all comes back to this same error each time
