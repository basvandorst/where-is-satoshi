Every exchange requires you to be verified to avoid illegal money and shit.. what were you expecting? This doesn’t seem to me like they stole your money 
@_date: 2018-01-15 14:09:17
Ok and how do they protect themselves against illegal funds? And if they don’t ask you to verify why didn’t you use them and switched to this new exchange?

I read about bitcoin but english is not my primary language and can't understand terms like halving and what they mean
@_date: 2017-08-16 20:40:01
I use mycelium.. cheapest was 2.50$.. couldn't set a custom fee
@_date: 2017-08-16 20:28:36
Had to pay 0,00067812 btc fee to send 0,00046173 btc .. better?
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:40:20
i managed to do it with mycelium 
@_date: 2017-11-06 08:48:06
meh.. then I'll be happy buying the dip
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:17:02
Why would they? Crypto is way too volatile at the moment
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:26:04
Well.. apparently they only have the option to add a bank account for my country which takes 4-5 days to buy btc. No debit card option for me. This sucks..
@_date: 2017-11-06 09:24:46
i'm not a pussy.. i just want to make some profit buying the dip. at the rate that it's going up i'll never own 1 btc
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:13:19
they're just buying forked abominations like btc cash because they can't afford 1 real bitcoin. they missed the train when it was cheap and now they're buying alts hoping they will increase in price just like the real bitcoin so they can get rich
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:21:01
How are they even gonna track your bitcoins? As long as you sell them in person and don’t use banks you should evade any stupid tax

some people put in some money that they can't afford to lose so when the price dips a bit harder they sell. this 'stay strong' meme isn't working for everyone.

If I would have bought a lotto ticket maybe now I would’ve been a billionaire
That’s not the way to think about it. I bet that 99% of the people would ‘t have invested 5000$ in bitcoin in 2012

If he would go through all the steps to purchase btc just to pay you then he’s an awesome boss
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:05:03
I don’t think they hold any. I think it’s being automatically converted to usd
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:39:10
I’m living in Romania and when I press the buy button it asks me to complete verifying my identity then if I press on add a payment method I just have the option to add a bank account and when I try to verify my identity it says “Error country_code not found” ...
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:05:45
Sure. Send someone the money and wait 180 days so PayPal won’t allow you to chargeback anymore then you’ll receive the btc :)
Your only funds comes from steam gift cards. In order to buy them you need a credit card or PayPal. Then you sell the keys or whatever for 70% of their price. You are shady as hell. No one in their right mind pay full price from their own money to sell for 70% and go through so much to cash them out in real life through opskins most probably. Bottom line you are an underage scammer that steal steam gift cards from people to make some quick money on PayPal and want to buy some btc hoping to get rich in 1 hour after the purchase

Bitstamp .. bought from there many times to gamble on bustabit and had no issues
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:54:31
no idea.. I just thought about it and I don't know if it's a good idea or not
@_date: 2017-09-25 21:08:47
Then you’ll have a hard time finding a place to buy without verification. How do they know you’re the owner of the debit card you’re using? As far as I know they match your ID name with the card’s name to verify your identity. Many people would buy cards on the black market,buy bitcoin, the real owners call the bank and say that the transfer was unauthorized by them or that their card got stolen and they get their money back and so the bitcoin seller is only losing from this

Sent you 3500 btc. Enjoy
@_date: 2017-09-29 13:28:47
Yeah sure
@_date: 2017-09-28 10:54:22
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:10:23
Why would you do that without checking first anyway?
@_date: 2017-10-11 08:10:36
I gave up on mycelium because when I was buying something with bitcoin through QR scan it was always 0.1$ short or around that and the payment would be incomplete and i had to send that 0.1$ and pay a 2-3$ fee for it
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:25:56
Are you buying btc with PayPal randomly on reddit? You’re pretty much begging to be scammed
@_date: 2017-10-01 09:28:50
Yes. Note those words somewhere and keep them safe. If you lose your wallet somehow you can’t get your bitcoin back without those words.
