This is the biggest dip in bitcoin history... buy buy buy!

Only time will tell. Look at the overall trajectory of bitcoin. If it doesn't die (hint: it won't), then it will bounce back in an unprecedented way.

Time to buy! This is the dip!

This is why BTC is going to be worth so much more. The more people using it, the better the value!

I think it's good on the one hand because bitcoin will increase in values as more people accept it. But on the other hand, if the advertisements get too frequent the mods should consider putting in some rules and asking ads go to another sub.

I might switch to Robbinhood. Anybody know about shady stuff with them, or are they clean?

Makes sense

This is helpful. Thank you. I read up a little and it turns out they only take a fee if you pull out and made a profit. Then they take 9% of your profit

I misread this as, " **Coinbase's Official Statement on Their Controversial Acquisition of Nintendo"**

Now we just need to speculate on how long it will take to get to that value 
@_date: 2019-06-03 13:29:00
Actually, no. I asked this question before reading the entire first page of the website. It turns out that they do take a fee at 9% when you exit with a profit. 
I have no affiliation with that website. I was genuinely curious to hear if others had any experience there.

Haven't paid for anything with bitcoin yet. Just buying $50 at a time when I cab afford it and HODLing for now.
