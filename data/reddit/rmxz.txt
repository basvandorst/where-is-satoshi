Well - it increases the chance that he was hired to ***announce*** BitCoin.
I think the paragraph *["My brother is an asshole. What you don't know about him is that he's worked on classified stuff. His life was a complete blank for a while. You're not going to be able to get to him. He'll deny everything. He'll never admit to starting Bitcoin."]( from the article makes it quite likely he was involved in some way.
But I still don't think it likely he did it all by himself without any peer review.

Shouldn't cash reside in the same legal gray area?
Some private companies (banks) create (by loaning money they don't hold) cash - which facilitates money laundering.

Sounds more like they're contemplating going after the people making the currency (mining) to prevent other people money laundering.
That sounds as insane as going after banks who create money (by loaning out money they don't physically hold), to stop people laundering money using cash.

Most of *your* dollars are just digital.    All your USD currency really is, is a few ones-and-zeros in some bank/stock-broker's computer.
The difference is that banks insure your deposits, while most bitcoin holding services don't.

Wouldn't a USB memory stick stored in a safe (just as you would any other coins) be the easiest secure choice?

Coins, small bills, barter, and gold also operate in the identical international legal grey area.
In each case you can make transactions; and choose to do it legally (declare them on your taxes, whatever), or less so.

*Your* bread seller.
There's a coffee shop in downtown Palo Alto that will happily sell you pastries for bitcoins.
