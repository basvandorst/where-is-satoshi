Wow I really don't know why you think any of this is bound to happen. It's a little alarming that you're going to be someone advancing the interests of bitcoin  it seems like the most likely scenario is that bitcoins coexist with fiat currency for low cost online transactions and other convenient legal uses(maybe with a grey area or black market but how is that different from cash?)
Also there is already a massive wealth disparity throughout the world. Why would bitcoin send the world into a tailspin all of a sudden?
Care to provide some logical reasoning instead of stating your daydreams as fact?
As a note I'm a btc supporter but your vision is going way off the deep end.

Yeah I can't believe how many people are jumping on this band wagon. Bitcoin isn't a silver bullet to solve the worlds problems. It will cause its own problems but it probably won't be something akin to the setting of a zombie movie like the OP wants us to think.

Maybe you wouldn't like to share this, but what portion of your trading fees are paid in btc vs fiat currency? Additionally, what do you do with the accrued btc fees. Are you holding onto them and filling orders with your btc when you feel it is advantageous? Are they converted to fiat currency as soon as the transaction is fulfilled at whatever the sale price was( example: 1 btc sold for 100 your fee is converted to $.006)? I'm just curious as to how this all works? Maybe this is something you wouldn't be sharing in a reddit thread though.

Well of course we will all come up with different ideas if we're just day dreaming. I don't mean this to be harsh but it seems like your trying to pass off your crazy possibilities as something that is likely. 
I could probably replace crypto currency with bananas and government with Monkeys on your original post and it would make as much sense.

Bitcoin can be great for Iran, but I don't think it will end up great for bitcoin if Iran started to use it en mass. There are heavy sanctions against any financial transactions with Iran. If this became a major outlet for Iranians to get around sanctions you can bet the governments of the world will crack down on bitcoin hard and fast. 
My two cents.

Honestly, any kids that lost something as significant as a new game system as a teenager will learn the lesson of investing in a volatile asset which is probably well worth it.  Having that knowledge when they're that young can hopefully prevent a lot of horrible decisions later when making financial decisions that will actually affect their life.
