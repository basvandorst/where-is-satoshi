Wrong! 
He says WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO MURDER children.
God has the right to murder whoever he may think deserves it. (yes, a pretty harsh statement, but its true).
He orders to kill some of them because he can see what it comes of them growing up. Therefor he releases his judgment on them.
Later on he can see that the Israelites still cant trust him and following therefor he uses plan b)
Which is JESUS! 
NOW Jesus is saying to us that we shouldn't take any life!
GOD however, always has that right!
Thats the problem, God is no character. God is simply God. One that is right about all. It is our human point of view that makes murder into what it is. In some cultures murder is normal. 
Keep in mind that he says the murder of children is wrong AFTER he tells the Israelites to kill them.
@_date: 2014-03-06 21:05:05
What if I refuse?
@_date: 2014-01-26 23:04:16
God was the head of state in Israel. He promised the Israelites the land if they trusted God there would only be good. That is why God lay the plans. It is well describe WHY God wanted the Israelites to kill them. They had to be punished for the ungodly actions they had commited. The same way as God will judge and punish us on doomsday. Also, during this time, prison was not a possibility so it had to be done this way. Also, God already warned them about it. They decided to ignore Gods warning and lived kept living sinfully (incest, sex, drunkenness, murder +++). God couldn't just sit by and watch it. There is no equal/opposite of a loving God and a punishing God, more like the other way around. What would have happend if God did not punish them? It would be anarchy and even more people would be killed. And example: What if your family was killed? Wouldn't you want justice to be served? They had to face judgement. How can God be loving, caring and fair if he didn't punish them for the bad things they had done? If he let them keep on doing what they did, wouldn't that be the same as saying it was alright?

My God did not stand on 4 pillars 6000 year ago.... It is important that you read the first books in the old testimony with a grain of salt. They are more of a symbolic book than a 100% correct interpitation. Remember, few people could read back then, so making pictures and metaphores was key to making people understand it.
Because there are outliers in science I cant throw a whole lab experience away. Everything has lots of inconsistent. There is nothing absolutely flawless. And God would not be caring if he was!

In my own opinion I believe that Worldcoin is a deserved  on the list. Although the market value is low at the moment it is probably the coin with the most development from its founders organization. The coin has its own designet wallet, a great informative website, good and serious community who all want to adopt the coin into theire everyday life and of course, soon, a marketplace to trade from Fiat -&gt; Worldcoin...
To be honest I wouldn't be to surprised if Worldcoin would overtake Litecoin into the future.

Here is the article:
Recently, a relatively unknown Chinese Bitcoin exchange exploded onto the scene, consuming more than half of all bitcoin trading volume in the world.  At a whopping ฿100,000 traded daily recently, Huobi.com claims about ten times that of BTCChina.  Of course, Chinese exchanges have been accused of falsifying exchange data in the past.  It does seem clear, though, that Huobi.com is operating in a regulatory gray area and does not have the legitimacy of the more established BTCChina.
Huobi’s story started in early December when China instituted a ban on the use of bitcoin by financial institutions.  This created turmoil when exchanges, at the height of bitcoin’s popularity, could no longer accept yuan directly.  While BTCChina and OKCoin suspended trading, Huobi quickly began accepting deposits directly into its CEO’s personal account.  It is hard to see this as a long term workaround, but Huobi at least attracted attention.  The upstart exchange also reduced, and possibly eliminated, its fees, resulting in a dramatic increase in volume.  There seems to be a consensus of opinion in the forums and on Reddit that much of this volume may be bots and daytraders, trying to exploit small swings in price.
Huobi’s dominance of the Chinese market has lasted most of December, but given its regulatory uncertainty in a heavily regulated environment, I find it unlikely that Huobi can maintain its position in the long term.  Chinese regulators would much prefer dealing with an obedient and compliant BTCChina than a risky and resistant Huobi.  Either Huobi will adjust to the will of the People’s Bank of China (likely a costly endeavor), or they will be closed down.  And once they shape up or shut down, we’ll see the volume return to normal, whatever that is for Bitcoin anyways.

You miss the point. Because I believe in Heaven I dont believe what God did was bad. Because infants and children enter heaven no matter what. So therefor, you can impossibly believe in heaven and say that the killing was a massacre.

-    | That is "probably" very wrong
No, most other Altcoins have development from the community, not the founders organization itself. A lot of people create the coin, and then just let it run its course.
-    | Don't they all?
Have you even seen the worldcoin wallet compared to a lot of the others? Most of them are just copies of one another.
-    | Disagree. I Checked it out, I see nothing that splits it from the pack of other cryptos in any way.
Honestly, If I wasn't a computer geek, I would not invest money into these coins just for the look it is displaying to the public:
 
If you take a look on:
You can see that the website presents a proffesional look, aswell as a broad translation for worldwide readers. Which makes it easy for everyone to adopt to the coin.
-    |Same as every other altcoin
Well, how do you explain "TO THEEE MOOOON"?
Serious? No.
Pure speculating? Yes.
-    | A large step behind many other alts
No, not really. Take a look at  and decide for yourself.
It is the first altcoin to present a exchange similar to the Bitcoin exchanges.
-    | "To be honest" that's a bold assertion.
It is a bold assertion, but yet a well investigated one.
I've been running Bitcoin, Litecoin and Worldcoin for ages.
As for the total impression, Bitcoin comes first due to it's huge public attention, Worldcoin second due to it's proffesionality and public adoptation focus and Litecoin third.

First of all, credit cards are stupid. Spend money you dont have! YAY! All of the sudden they change the interesst and your doomed. Here are some reason why Bitcoin is the new deal.
Smaller fees, transactions are done in minutes, not hours. It's easier to steal credit card information than Bitcoin information. The "rewards" you get from using credit cards are not worth more than the interesst you pay for using them. Therefor, you dont really get anything for free, you just get some of what you pay in interest back again.

Okai, here it is to justify the murder in the old testamony. YES! The OLD TESTAMONY! God was leading the Israelites almost like a head of state, simply because they where the people choosen by God himself.
He saw that the Amalakites where working against the Israelites with sinful habbits. He also saw that the children and infants grew up to become much like they're ancestors. So God gave the order to the Israelites to end the line of the Amalakites. 
Remember that God himself, is still allowed to judge us. If we deserve to die or not. He did NOT take away they're right to enter into Heaven. No. He simply protected them (especially the children and the infants) from being corrupted with the sin that the Amalakites where displaying. Now, I am no theolog, however I strongly recommand reading this article well, here he explains the whole concept of the slaughter not being a slaughter as we think it is.
Also, later we can hear that God later on sends down his son, Jesus.
Here he restates most of which he has done in the old testamony. Jesus comes with a lot of the famous sayings such as love your neighboor and turn the other cheek and so on.
These morals are what we Christians live by now.
And for those witch burnings you are talking about. These individuals DID NOT display anything of which the bible tells us to do and there IS NOTHING in the bible saying that we have the right to kill witches or judge others. It is simply the sinful act of a pastor with to much power and to little controll over his actions. 
I would like to refer to a lot of people doing SICK things, simply because they get power sick. Here are some atheist examples:

So I asumme you know EVERYTHING about ALL THAT "prooves" that God does not exist? Otherwise you are making assumptions of your meaning of life out of a few theories aswell...

@_date: 2014-01-26 17:17:11
My God doesn't say that any people deserve to die. My God clearly states that it is God who shall judge us, not us humans. There is absolutely nothing in the Bible that states that some people deserve less respect than others.
To answer 1. Sam 15,3: 
@_date: 2014-01-26 23:17:26
Because you haven't read the article, here it is:
The killing of the Canaanite children not only served to prevent assimilation to Canaanite identity but also served as a shattering, tangible illustration of Israel’s being set exclusively apart for God.
Moreover, if we believe, as I do, that God’s grace is extended to those who die in infancy or as small children, the death of these children was actually their salvation.  We are so wedded to an earthly, naturalistic perspective that we forget that those who die are happy to quit this earth for heaven’s incomparable joy.  Therefore, God does these children no wrong in taking their lives.
@_date: 2014-01-26 23:57:11
So you believe in a God? Because atheists cannot in anyway claim an objective moral position to this. This is the reason why (moral argument for God’s existence):
1. If God does not exist, objective moral values do not exist.
2. Objective moral values do exist.
3. Therefore, God exists.

Yes of course, however, if you planned good, you wouldn't need credit cards... just start of by planning a month ahead and save up for special occasions... there is a reason why credit cards exist. To trap users in having to pay interesst.

I recommand going on this thread I started over in the Christian reddit. I dont like to answer this question as I dont feel qualified enough to answer through Gods words.

I apologize for taking a deffensive position, and would like to say this:
Let me believe what I want. It's okai if you dont want to support my religious beliefs. I do believe in a free will, and respect you for what you believe in. However, I do doubt and question my faith, aswell as weigh out my arguments, but I have come to the personal conclusion that I wish to believe in Jesus as the Messias.
I hope you find peace in whatever you feel is right for you.

If it's in cash, then it is...

Because you dont believe in heaven...
But as I have said plenty of times already...
God sent Jesus and christianity has a changed point of view in this matter now from what it used to have!
It is important that we look at what christianity means today, not what it ment thousand years ago when the whole world was different.

That's a good thing though, it will help take the attention of the poor fella...
