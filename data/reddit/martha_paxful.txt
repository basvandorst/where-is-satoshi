If you're new to bitcoin, I suggest you checkout the Paxful Bitcoin Wallet app which is available for IOS and Android, it will get you a feel of how Bitcoin wallets work and then switch to a cold storage wallet where your bitcoins will be stored offline making it much safer. There are lists available online of the best cold storage wallet to use. Good luck, I hope this helps!

We highly discourage our users to trade outside of Paxful's escrow (canceling the trade and trading somewhere else) the escrow system is there to protect both the buyer and the seller. We created a [video]( on how to detect scams when buying bitcoins and you may also join our Facebook group called 'Paxful School' where you can join discussions with other Paxful traders. If you have any questions, feel free to message me or join r/paxful.

If you're receiving from an external wallet it would take 3 confirmations to make your balance fully available and 6 confirmations if you are sending from a Paxful wallet to an external wallet. This is the industry standard for a truly secure wallet. This can take anywhere from five minutes to an hour, depending on the bitcoin network. The fee actually varies depending on the method of payment you accept for selling your bitcoin.
**Some of our fees:**  
Bank Transfers: 0.1%  
Credit/Debit Cards: 1%  
Digital Currencies: 1%  
Online Transfers: 1%  
Cash Deposits: 1%  
Gift Cards: 5% iTunes and Google Play.  
2% for every other gift card.  
Paxful charges a flat wallet send out fee of 0.0005 BTC for every send out from the wallet to an external Bitcoin address. This fee covers the associated miner fee and maintenance of our secure wallet infrastructure. We've actually lowered these fees and we'll continue working hard on lowering it even more, thanks to all of our users support.
