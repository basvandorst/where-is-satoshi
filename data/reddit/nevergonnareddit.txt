If the government tells people not to listen to me, they can actually do a good job at suppressing thoughts  from the public conversation.

Your suggested changes increase the security of the protocol. The design of Glacier makes some trade-offs to be easier to use at the expense of higher security. In particular, we considered targeted physical attacks outside the scope of the protocol. We leave it to users to come up with their own additional countermeasures for those (though we make some suggestions in Appendix A).

Much of the extreme tedium comes from downloading and verifying all the software that is used. If the software was shipped as a bootable .iso file, like EtherOS except for Cold Storage, that would greatly speed the process and prevent against errors. 
Somebody do it!

For most users, techniques like this will work well. Glacier is designed for people storing large amounts of coins who want extra-high security. Imagine if you had $10 million in bitcoin. Would you trust your current process? 
For starters, if you're using an existing used laptop to run bitaddress, you could be vulnerable to all sorts of malware. The random number software could be tampered with or malware could save the generated private keys to transmit to an attacker the next time you connected to the internet. 
Many of these vectors can be alleviated by using a new air-gapped computer with the wifi cards removed, verifying all the software that is used, and never transferring any data off the air-gapped machine through electronic means. Once you begin to go down *that* rabbit hole, you spend a few months thinking about it and develop Glacier.

I'm in favor of segwit 2x with replay protection. Let the best coin win. 
I'm nervous about core opposing 2x. I sold my BCH, but a messy 2x launch leaves a possible market opportunity for BCH to take over. It doesn't seem like 2x is that risky, and it gives us time to have a useable network while other solutions to scale come online.

The FBI could still force coinbase to serve you a webpage that harvests your password, so it's not as secure as storing your own funds. But even then they could only run away with your coins after you've logged in. And you have to balance that risk against the risk of losing your coins or having low security if you store them yourself. 
@_date: 2017-01-25 03:54:37
You still hold two of the three multisig keys in a 2-of-3 multisig configuration. The government needs to come to your door to get them. 
@_date: 2017-01-25 07:19:35


Nope. Coinbase has a key, you have a key, and the third key is shared but encrypted by a password that never hits Coinbase's servers. So Coinbase does not have the ability to run away with your funds. Also, you can configure your multisig vault differently if you don't like the default.
I still wouldn't use it for large amounts of funds. But it's way more secure than most web wallets. 
@_date: 2017-01-26 02:54:29
When you use your multisig vault, you will type in your encrypted key password to the webpage. The webpage claims that it decrypts the key and does the transaction signing in the web browser, and you can check to see whether or not that webpage is sending any suspect data back to coinbase. But you probably won't check every time. And nothing stops them from pushing out a malicious page some of the time to harvest key passwords, except that they would lose all their customers and go bankrupt if they got caught. Still, the FBI could force them to do it on a targeted basis. 
But I think that an unlikely scenario. More likely, you will have a bit of malware on your system that logs all your keystrokes when you are visiting coinbase.com and sends them off to some hacker.

I see a lot of questions as to where you should store your coins. I have spent a lot of time researching this problem, so I am going to move my answer to a top-level comment so that more people see it:
There's no right answer. Where you store your coins is a cost/benefit decision. How much cost are you willing to pay for improved security of your coins? Furthermore, most viable options aren't really "more secure" than the others. Rather they reduce some risk (such as theft) at the expense of introducing other risks (such as loss).
There are, however, some wrong answers. Don't keep your coins on an internet-connected computer that you use for other purposes. Have you or anyone you know ever had malware on your computer? That malware could have uploaded your bitcoin wallet to a third-party. 
Furthermore, many exchanges and third-party wallet services have been hacked. I wouldn't trust any of them without thoroughly reviewing their security practices. 
How do your other options stack up? 
**Coinbase** has fantastic security practices. Most customer funds are kept offline in cold storage. Their cold storage uses an *m-of-n* sharding scheme for keys with high *m* and *n*, making it incredibly difficult for even an insider to defraud the company. Chances are Coinbase will not lose your money. 
If you want even higher security, Coinbase offers a multisig vault. This stores your coins in a 2-of-3 multisig wallet and gives you control over 2 keys (one is derived from a password, so you can still recover your coins if you lose your other key). Using Coinbase's multisig vault, even if Coinbase is hacked your coins will not be lost. 
Is coinbase perfectly safe? No. Among other things, they have a huge target on their back for hackers. But would I trust them with $10,000 worth of coins? Hell yes. They offer far higher security than you are likely to achieve through a naive home system.
The big risk that you run with Coinbase as opposed to a home solution is regulatory risk. You might have noticed that Coinbase limits how many coins you can withdraw per day, and it disallows sending coins to certain addresses. This is because Coinbase complies with AML/KYC law. 
**Hardware wallets** are simple to use and offer paper backups. Used properly, they will protect your funds even on a computer that is potentially compromised because you have used it for other purposes. They are inexpensive (&lt;$100). Hardware wallets are a fantastic choice for all but the richest and most paranoid holders. They give you sovereignty over your funds and you never have to worry about a new regulation compromising your access. 
However, hardware wallets introduce loss risk as opposed to Coinbase. You may lose your wallet and your backup. Being a sovereign over your own property carries a certain amount of responsibility. You should use a difficult password, perhaps stored in a password manager, and keep a copy of your recovery seed geographically separated from your home. Also, you need to trust the wallet vendor not to install backdoors.  
I use a hardware wallet for my own funds. 
**Paper Wallets** are hard to get right but also offer the ultimate in security for someone that carefully pays attention to detail. Earlier this year, I worked on a research project for developing an ultra-high security checklist for creating paper wallets. It takes about 4 hours to complete and requires equipment costing $800. You can find it [here: The Glacier Protocol]( Should you use it? Probably not. Now what if  you had $1 million in bitcoins? Then I think you should look into doing something like this. 
There are pitfalls to using paper wallets. If you get some of those details wrong, such as making a paper wallet on a "dirty" computer that you use for other purposes, your level of security is less than what you would get with a hardware wallet. Doing it properly requires substantial time and money investment. 
Overall, I would say keep your money in Coinbase for &lt;$10,000. For $10,000 - $500,000 use a hardware wallet. For $500,000 plus, look into a high-security multisig paper backup system like the Glacier Protocol. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 16:59:53


Yes, unless you write down a backup seed and keep it somewhere safe. Most wallets allow for this. 
My suggestion is hardware wallet &gt; phone software wallet &gt; laptop software wallet, in order of security.

Here's a comment I [wrote yesterday]( about how to store your funds. 
- Coinbase has rad security for an exchange. 
- Coinbase multisig vault is easy to use and way safer than coinbase.
- Hardware wallets are simple to use, highly secure, and are great for someone looking to store their own funds. They also put you outside of Coinbase's regulatory limitations
- Paper wallets are even better, but tricky to get right. Use the [Glacier Protocol](
- Storing your own coins on a general purpose computing device is better than storing on a shitty exchange, but way more risky than storing on Coinbase. You are one virus away from having your wallet uploaded to a third-party. If you're going to use a software wallet, keep that shit air-gapped.

My final PSA: keeping your coins on a personal computer that you use for other purposes is a **terrible** idea. Coin-stealing malware is profitable, and likely to become more prevalent in future years. Have you or anybody you known ever had a computer virus? I have. That virus could have scanned your harddrive for bitcoin wallets and uploaded them to a third party.

Coinbase has very good security for a cloud provider. The risk of losing your funds to theft is extremely low. Furthermore, with their multisig vault option you get even higher security, and they can't prevent you from accessing your funds if you do the standard 2-of-3 option. 
Coinbase is a fine option for people with a small amount of bitcoin who aren't willing or able to put in the time and money investment of properly using a hardware wallet or paper wallet. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 18:54:15
Your coins are probably safer on Coinbase than on a wallet on a general-purpose computer connected to the internet. It is trivial for a piece of malware to upload your unencrypted wallet files to a third-party. On the other hand, Coinbase has excellent security practices (only a few % of funds are kept in a hot wallet, the remaining funds are kept in cold storage using m-of-n keys with high m and high n). 
If you're going to store your own funds, get serious and get a hardware wallet. Or use an airgapped computer that you don't use for day-to-day tasks.

I don't think iOS does that. I'm not sure about Android. 
Lots of companies collect usage data from events like search queries. Few collect *every keystroke on your system*. That's pretty much a Windows 10 thing. Even Microsoft wasn't doing that a few years ago. 
@_date: 2017-05-03 05:55:15
It depends on the hardware wallet. The Trezor microprocessor has a hardware RNG that gathers entropy from analog sources (it ships with [this processor]( It mixes that entropy with some from your computer when it generates seeds. That's solid, but it has the drawback of being opaque to the user. If there is some way to add your own high-quality manual entropy into that pool that removes one place where you have to trust someone else. 
Note that I said *adding* not *replacing*. If you *only* use dice or cards as your entropy source, the odds of a human screwing it up are probably greater than the odds that your Trezor and your computer have broken entropy sources. 
My dream hardware wallet would offer an easy way to input your own dice rolls directly through the wallet's interface, to add to its entropy sources. I don't think any of these exist. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 18:52:40
Not if you're connecting the computer running Electrum to the internet and installing all sorts of binaries on it. It's trivial for a bit of malware to scan your computer for electrum wallets and upload them to a third-party. 
Keeping your coins in Coinbase is probably safer than storing them in an Electrum wallet on your gaming laptop. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 16:53:18
Hardware wallets give you the option of backing up your seed (a set of 24 words) to paper. Using this seed the state of your device can be completely recovered. 
Furthermore, many of them allow you to use a password as something of a 25th word. So even if someone gets ahold of your seed, they won't have access to your wallet.  
@_date: 2017-06-26 23:14:03


Unfortunately I don't have a single source that I can recommend. I learned it all myself by developing [the Glacier Protocol]( Reading through the "Background" and "Protocol Overview" of the Glacier Protocol doc is a good start. 


Yes. 


Yes. If you have a Trezor backup seed saved in a textfile on your CPU, it is not that hard for a program (malware) to recognize and send to a third-party. 


This would provide a small amount of additional security, but not enough to rely on. The wordset that Trezor uses is known and public. A slightly more sophisticated virus would send any text documents that contain words from the Trezor wordset to its master. If your method becomes widely used, then I expect malware would adapt to counter it. And as the value of cryptocurrencies increase, I expect the sophistication of malware targeting crypto wallets to increase. 
You gain a lot of security by never storing your wallet seeds electronically on a general-purpose computer, far more than you will gain through any tricks to obfuscate them. 
Now, if you are talking about encoding your seed into a **paper** journal entry written **by hand**, then this isn't a terrible idea. There is an additional loss risk if you forget your encoding system. But the extra level of obfuscation might stop some casual thefts, such as a maid stumbling upon your seed and recognizing it for what it is. However, using a strong password with your Trezor, stored in a password manager, will already keep you well-protected since both the seed and the password are needed to restore your wallet.  
@_date: 2017-06-27 16:58:33
You're on the right track. Your current storage strategy sounds decent. But depending on the amount of value you have stored in crypto and your risk tolerance, you might think about taking a few more steps to further secure your coins against low-probability events. 
To secure your coins against natural disaster (hurricane/earthquake/fire) you can keep a copy of your key somewhere geographically separated from your house. I sent a copy of my seed to a trusted friend who lives elsewhere (who doesn't have my password), but you could also store a copy in a safe deposit box in a bank a few towns over or something. 
I also have a strategy for my family to get access to my password in case I die. So two people will be able to put together my seed + password in case of my death. If that's important to you, it's worth thinking about.
**Password Managers**
Password managers are great because they overcome the limits of human memory. They allow you to use a unique strong password for each service you use while only requiring you to memorize ONE strong master password. The password managers derive an encryption key from your master password and encrypts your data client-side. This means that the password manager service only sees an encrypted version of your data on their servers.
I recommend password managers for anyone that uses many web services (i.e. everybody). It's important to have unique passwords so that if your data is leaked by one service, like Yahoo!, the attackers can't use your recovered data to hack your accounts on other services. It's also important to use strong passwords that aren't easily brute-forced. In the context of our current conversation, it's especially important to use strong, unique passwords for online bitcoin services and services that can be used for account recovery, such as your email. It's also important to use non-SMS 2FA.
The drawback of a password manager is that it requires SOME trust in the password manager service. They may encrypt data client-side, but the FBI could strong arm them to send a software update that looks legit but sends your unencrypted data somewhere. If it were ever publicly known that they collaborated like this, it would kill their business, so I doubt this would be done very frequently. But it is a possibility. 
Your solution is actually quite similar to a password manager and it is probably good enough. Make sure your "master password" is strong and well-memorized. If you ever change it, make sure to practice typing it once a week for a few months. 
There are two drawbacks to your approach compared to a password manager. First, the "strong passwords" you come up with are likely to be less random and more related than one automatically generated by a manager. So if someone knew a password for one of your accounts, they might have an easier time guessing a password for another account. Secondly, your encrypted volume will be lost if your laptop is broken, lost, or destroyed. Password managers have a cloud backup, you do not. So make sure you keep a backup of your encrypted volume somewhere.

Accept ZEC. It also safeguards your users' privacy. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 15:52:12
To add to this:
Make sure you think about the risk of loss. If your house burns down, will you lose your Trezor and your Trezor paper backup? 
Think about risk of theft. Did you take a picture of your Trezor backup seed? Bad idea. Now that bitcoin is only as safe as the device storing your digital picture file. Have you ever had a computer virus? A future version of that virus may scan drives for bitcoin keys. 
Never, ever, make a digital copy of a backup seed, especially in the cloud. You've heard of the NSA tapping google's and facebook's data centers? It would be trivial for them to scan for secp256k1 private keys and steal your coins in a completely untraceable way. 
When using a hardware wallet, always use the option to add a password, and make it a strong password stored in a password manager. Keep this separate from the seed so that even if the seed is compromised, your coins are safe. 
Coinbase has an incredible security operation and insurance on the bitcoin they hold. Your coins may be less likely to get lost or stolen at Coinbase than self storage if you don't know what you are doing. If you use their multisig vault feature, you can lower the trust that you put in them while maintaining high security. Make sure you use a password manager with a strong password and 2FA (authy) on your Coinbase account. 
The major downside of keeping coins on coinbase is that 1) they are a huge target and 2) there is regulatory risk (coinbase may be forced to restrict your coin sales/withdrawals by the US government). But I actually think it is an ok option for long-term holders of modest amounts of bitcoin who lack technical sophistication. 
If you have a lot of bitcoin and lack technical sophistication, hire me to design a custom cold storage solution for you. I am an author on [this]( and I know a thing or two about cold storage.
