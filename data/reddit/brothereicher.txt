I am the director of a residential facility for adults with developmental disabilities. We deal with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, as well as general cognitive impairment. 
Our goal is to help our residents learn life skills, such as emotional control and socialization, as well as job skills that will enable them to live as independently as possible in spite of their limitations. We have contacts with local businesses who assist us with job placements, as residents gain the skills necessary for employment.
Here's our website, if you're interested in learning more:

Not sure why you say that. I thought the video was hilarious, and indicative of the prevailing views regarding Bitcoin.
But if it needs to be removed, that's fine. I'm new to the community. No desire to cause issues.

"With bitcoin, you are replacing trust in the solvency of a government and its institutions with trust in the codebase, cryptography and incentives used to run the decentralized network..."
OK, class. Which of these two options is more worthy of trust?

I loved the part where he first says that you can only use Bitcoins to buy other Bitcoins, and then says that terrorists are using them, in the hopes of getting rich? And all these people buying them are millennials who are postponing buying houses, which should clearly be everyone's financial goal.

How was this not entrapment?
They deliberately escalated the purchases to push them above the legal threshold.
These agents are scum.

"Last week, Arizona’s legislators took the strange step of preparing laws to accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as tax payments.
This is equivalent to Canada Revenue Agency announcing it will accept Canadian Tire or Monopoly money as payment."
Funny, the anti-crypto crowd keeps saying "fiat has value BECAUSE you can pay taxes with it. That makes it real money."
Now suddenly, when state governments move to allow taxes to be paid in cryptos, it's still not real money.
