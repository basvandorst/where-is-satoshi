Agree we need some taxes. Agree we need some government. Agree Tax system has flaws. 
The rich pay higher % taxes than poor on average, you understand the tiered system right? When I was younger I paid zero taxes because i only made 15k a year. Now i make a lot more, and trust me, i pay WAY more in taxes, both as a % of my income and as a flat dollar amount. At what point do you think it becomes fair? Should Jeff Bezos pay more than the 40 or 50% he already pays? The literally billions of dollars he pays? Not to mention the hundreds of thousands of jobs he's giving us or the amazing products and services Amazon provides? The goods you order on Amazon Prime, the books that have educated me on Audible? The websites we use every day hosted on Amazon Web Services and the massive internet development that's been made affordable via AWS?
What more do you want from him? When will you be happy? When we increase his tax rate to 80% so he just says fuck it and moves to another country? Moves Amazon to another country like Apple already has done on large scale? Or when other countries just out compete us?

Strongly disagree on this one bud, but no worries. I think 100k is almost sure thing in next 2 years. Very possible we hit it within 6 months. The mining reward being "too high" is not a limiting factor. We've never seen that be a problem before. Hashrate and difficulty will just increase. We've seen price and mining reward rise by 20x multiple times.
@_date: 2019-07-08 07:48:16
I give Bitcoin 85% chance of hitting 100k-200k in next 6-24 months. 
I give Bitcoin 60% chance of hitting 450k-1mil in next 3-5 years. 
I give Bitcoin 30% chance of hitting 10mil in next 20-30 years.

Laszlo had actually obtained about 70,000 Bitcoin early on when he figured out you could mine faster by routing the hash function through the video card. He told Satoshi about this, and Satoshi had told him that he didn't mind coins being concentrated or anything philosophical like that, but that the network was stronger when many people were participating, and asked Laszlo to take it easy on the "high powered mining". Laszlo luckily was a strong supporter and not purely focused on making money, so he spent most of the 70,000 on pizzas over the next couple weeks as more people on the forums stepped up to take him up on his offer of trading Bitcoins for Pizza. There is mention of his daughter being happy for so much pizza over the next couple weeks lol.

Why would you need 5% risk free? I'll give you 10% per year. S&amp;P500. It's been working out for almost 100 years now. And if you want to be extra conservative go 50% s&amp;p500, 25% gold, 25% Treasury Bonds. It really is that easy. You'd get over 5% a year with that mix almost 100% for sure over long time period and be hedged against major financial collapse.
@_date: 2019-07-28 23:39:27
People don't leave because it's the best country in the world. That's exactly how the government gets away with what it does. Going off the above example, if the President or King of the US was allowed to have sex with anyone he wanted, and we all still chose to stay because the country is better than any other country, it doesn't mean it's ok or cool that he rapes people. It wasn't ok that slavery happened either, but instead of just leaving like you suggest, like a coward, we choose to stay, we choose to fight back and change things from within. I love the US, it's absolutely amazing. That doesn't mean I have to agree with all the policies and take it in the ass, or just leave. We can and ought to fight for what we believe in.

Is percent really the fairer way to look at it? Did you know that the top 10% pays 90% of the countries taxes? People have this weird thing where they think the rich are getting away with everything and not doing their part. 
The reality is, if you make less than 40k a year, you're actually costing the country money, not making the country money. This is based on the cost per person to maintain roads, social programs, military etc. 
To clarify
I am pro capitalism
I am pro business
I want smaller government
I want lower spending
I want lower taxes
People are upset with the way their lives are or the unfairness of the system. Don't take your anger out on rich people or business people who create jobs, provide great services we all know and love, and pay 90% of the taxes. Take your anger out on the government, and banks who are skimming a little off the top of every transaction, and we have no say in it.
Bitcoin is the answer.
@_date: 2019-07-30 09:40:45
You're wrong. Top 10% pays 90% of the countries taxes. You're just plain wrong at the fundamental level which makes the rest of your argument mostly invalid.
@_date: 2019-07-22 02:32:20
I don't think that is entirely true. If Bcash or Bsv were not around, Bitcoin would most certainly be higher in price, hashrate, volume, reputation etc. There are definitely people who buy Bcash or Bsv instead of Bitcoin either because they get tricked into it, are uneducated, are hedging their Bitcoin bet, or because they have alternative reasons like vendetta against Core, ego (Roger and Craig selling Bitcoin to prop Bcash and Bsv price). 
One thing to note though is that there are benefits to the fork for both sides. Now Bitcoin Core, Blockstream, and other devs are able to move much more swiftly and efficiently since Roger, Craig, and other big blockers left and aren't there to hamstring any initiatives. Bitcoin is designed to be very hard to change, and they were making it just that much harder. Now Bitcoin can grow with less friction, and also the Bcashers and BSVers get the big blocks they want, and can strike their own egos off, but at a major cost. They are now part of the clown projects and not part of real Bitcoin which will win in the end. They're on essentially the losing teams now, when they both came from the God King Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-03 01:39:00
Not entirely true. Some of the very first people who did transactions on Bitcoin were talking about the potential of it becoming a world reserve currency. You can find it in old forum archives or more easily in the book Digital Gold by Nathaniel Popper. Read it or listen to Audiobook using Audible. You'll thank me later. It's fucking good.
@_date: 2019-07-11 00:24:24
50% S&amp;P500, 25% Gold, 25% Treasury Bonds or some other safe haven assets is quite conservative. S&amp;P500 is more conservative than many funds you can buy into. (See Warren Buffets 10 year bet that just concluded last year) 
If you are looking at holding for 20+ years for retirement, you really can't lose unless some seriously catastrophic event happens like the US is taken over by Germany, nuclear holocaust, or some other major black swan event. Even a depression wouldn't put S&amp;P500 negative over 30-40 years, no chance in hell. For example, S&amp;P dropped 57% in the financial crisis, but climbed 447% over the next 10 years, because typically that's what happens after big drops. Over long time horizon S&amp;P500 is conservative.
S&amp;P500 is constantly changing, weighted with top 500 US companies, and if one fails, your allocation gets replaced with new company on the list automatically, using algorithms which don't require high management fees. 
Over time as you get older, you can start to move assets from S&amp;P500 to T-bonds/Gold in higher proportion. Personally, I'd say to be 80% S&amp;P500 or more if you are in the age bracket of 20-35. 
I am 32 and I personally am 80% Bitcoin, 15% S&amp;P, 5% gold. No treasury bonds for me. 
The point of all of this is, ANYONE following a very basic strategy could beat Social Security by an order of magnitude, and also not have to worry about social security running out due to mis management by the government. I'm not trying to be mean or abrasive, we NEED to educate each other so we don't rely on these terrible government programs.
@_date: 2019-07-10 11:00:44
Wait what, how do people not see that this is terrible? The people commenting on how it saves old people? You totally missed the point. The point is that it is MIS MANAGED. WHY are we receiving peanuts for what we pay in? If any idiot managed the money and simply bought 50% S&amp;P500, 25% Treasury Bonds, and 25% Gold, which is a very conservative portfolio, we would be receiving MUCH MORE than this. The government is TERRIBLE at managing funds. THE WORST. You guys think it's about either giving or not giving to old people. No one is giving anyone shit, The government takes your money your whole life, then gives you a fraction of it back. It's astounding how badly gas lighted the people being negative about this post are. I hate that word, but it really works in this situation. The government is FUCKING YOU, and you're sitting there taking it happily.

Yes. I can also say that I think someday we will have self driving cars.... but I "can't say for sure". You're being difficult for the sake of being difficult. 
It's a fact that there are miners who moved their hash power to Bcash and BSV. It's also a fact that there are people who come into the industry new and choose to buy some Btrash because they don't know any better. Don't be a Bcash Btwat bro.

Yes, it most certainly is. Again, people think "I have social security" and it creates this weak comfort blanket so they don't focus on building their own retirement. I see this constantly, and I talk to people about investing every single day, sometimes 4 or 5 people in a day. It's all I talk about, and my mission in life... to educate people about Bitcoin, investing, compound interest, retirement, time preference, sacrificing now for later.
@_date: 2019-07-29 02:34:57
I disagree. The job of a business owner is to make as much money as they can, just like the job of the employee is to make as much money as HE can. You may not like that the world is cutthroat and that people act in self interest, but that's how it is and will always be. Of course every system has downsides. One downside of capitalism you may argue is that business owners think more of themselves than of their employees. I think it's actually just fine. The system works very well. 
Dodging taxes: all companies and individuals have the right to pay ONLY what they have to pay and no more. You do the same thing I'm sure. Do you tell your tax guy, hey, don't worry about finding me savings, just pay whatever it doesn't matter. Of course not. If I told you a tax trick to pay less that was legal, would you take it or say "oh no I love giving uncle Sam all I can". Why is it different for owners of businesses in your mind?
Also if you are only worth minimum wage, and you aren't 18-25 years old, you're really doing something wrong in this one life you've been given.
@_date: 2019-07-08 10:40:55
It would unfortunately take too long to give my take on this. It's a blend of the value vs gold, currencies, other stores of value, medium of exchange, the patterns in previous cycles, the halvening coming up, institutional interest, very small early penetration with lots of room to grow, and the fact that I believe it's drastically undervalued for the utility it provides. 100k is only 9x from here. Quite normal for Bitcoin to see runs like that.

SO FUCKING TRUE. and 5% is conservative actually. S&amp;P500 Index has done on average 12% over last 90 years. Over last 10 years has done around that with dividend included. This would multiply the 1.9mil by probably 5x due to compounding.

If your friends in construction "aren't thinking about it", then by definition, they're relying on social security lol. Unless they actually do have 401k's?
 I've chosen to invest my own money in Bitcoin mostly which has done incredibly well for me over the years, S&amp;P500, and a little bit of gold... plus my Tesla shares, but that's mostly just to support Elon :)  Cool side note, you can put Bitcoin in your 401k now :) My friends over at iTrust Capital are doing this!
@_date: 2019-07-22 02:21:50
The scam part is that he owns bitcoin.com and tries to say Bcash is Bitcoin. It is by definition NOT Bitcoin. Bitcoin has the most hash power by FAR. Like 72x last I checked. Much higher transaction volume, more daily wallets etc. The community has voted and Bitcoin is the real Bitcoin. Bcash is Bcash. If Roger would just try to market it as a Bitcoin fork with bigger block scaling, people may have been ok with it. He chose to fight Bitcoin, that's a real stupid battle to take on.

My idea of taxing the poor at higher rate? I never said anything like that. The rich pay higher % generally. Some corporations pay low %s because they re invest most of their profit. I think corporations paying low taxes is much more common than high net worth individuals paying low taxes.

1. They DO invest the money... it isn't just sitting in a bank account losing value due to inflation... the question is WHY are they so bad at investing the money? Why do they pay less than any conservative investor could make? Again we could go 50% treasury bonds, 25% s&amp;p500, 25% gold, or whatever mix of risk on risk off portfolio... no matter what you invested in, you'd get more back than they are giving you....... 
and btw we DO turn profit from our police and military... ever get a ticket for speeding? Police departments and court systems are highly profitable. Most of what our military does is enforce our monetary system, sanctions, make sure our trade routes are solid etc. They are all monetarily driven.

You'd be surprised how financially uneducated the population is. They are indeed relying on social security, and I'd call them on the higher end of educated spectrum. They are just finally saving their first little bit of money in Bitcoin after 4 years of me hounding them to save for retirement.

He was being sarcastic about the dormitories lol. That's the point. Stop letting the government manage our lives. Social security is inefficient. If we had no social security, people would educate themselves, and their children etc about saving. With this current system no one saves shit because they expect the big nice government to hold their hand. It's terrible for society, and just one of many problems that make our society lazier and stupider. The current system is designed to nurture that dependence on the government.

Socialism-Capitalism is a spectrum. We find historically, undoubtedly, and unequivocally that as countries move towards the socialism side of the spectrum, they deteriorate in most regards including wealth gaps, and living quality of the poor. 
Socialism is a dangerous ideology that is often touted by uneducated individuals, and usually comes in the form of a trojan horse, always packaged differently with the promise that "This socialism is different than the past historical failed versions" 
The most recent version is "democratic socialism" which is equally as, or more scary than other versions because it is deceiving and many are falling for it.

Bro I think you misunderstand how SegWit works. It does not add anything to the size of the blockchain. It actually drastically reduces size of transactions.  SegWit transactions are smaller than non SegWit which is why they have smaller fees. This is a simplified way of looking at it of course. The actual explanation is a bit more length and I recommend you listen to Andreas Antonopoulos explanation here: 
@_date: 2019-08-23 09:14:06
Bro I know this lol. I have watched every Andreas Antonopoulos video ever made. He does not say Blocksize should NEVER increase. That is not his stance. I understand that bigger blocks may result in centralization due to the barrier to entry for running a node. If we keep block size low for long enough, Moore's law takes over. At what point can we increase block size? Andreas has actually said that at some point blocksize increase is ok, and will multiply the other layers and increases like SegWit, Lightning, Taproot etc

I understand that, I use Bitcoin 5-10 times a day many days brotha. My question isn't do we need one now. It's should we consider the option in the future when tx volume increases exponentially. The system even with full SegWit adoption will only get us 12tx/sec. It is clear this won't be enough for global adoption. Alistair your name is familiar, are you a known figure in Bitcoin?

Traditionally people refer to inflation as increase in cost of goods against the dollar. This is price inflation aka decrease in purchasing power
Another way to view inflation is monetary inflation. This is expanding the money supply. 
Bitcoin has done neither. Increase in value of money would be price deflation, aka increase in purchasing power. 
I have no idea what you're trying to say bud.
@_date: 2019-08-10 10:50:04
Oh that's amazing! Any chance they have a debit card? That's the only reason I actually tried Bitpay was because they have a Debit Card and Shift got shut down which was my old Bitcoin Debit card. Loved shift, but not big fan of Coinbase who was their old partner. I'm looking for a debit card that is done by a company with high integrity.
@_date: 2019-08-27 09:13:04
There are still risks to that. If someone puts a gun to your head and asks you to hand over your Bitcoin for example. Of course there are ways to add layers of security including multi sig, plausible deniability, multiple layers of encryption, separating keys into 2 pieces, geographic distance etc, but most people don't have the understanding for that so holding some of their Bitcoin in a bank or exchange may have it's uses. 
I think with time we will create smart contracts, better hardware, better software, better UX, so this won't be needed eventually. 
I would even consider holding 5% of my Bitcoin in a bank if I thought the bank wouldn't get pressured by govt. Except that they will lol.

You're the second person to say this on this thread. Where are you guys getting this. It's literally the opposite. SegWit take less space so it effectively increases block size, but does not actually increase the block size. It's win win. It raises capacity of network while lowering fees. When big wallets don't use it, they bog down the entire network with their bloated transactions. So it raises fees for everyone!

Bitpay does help with adoption, but so do other companies who do the same thing, so let's support those companies which support SegWit and if Lightning even better. Companies like Bitpay are hurting the whole network by not upgrading. They increase every single one of us fees. If they upgraded it would actually noticeably lower entire networks fees

Lol. The irony in your statements. 
You suckle at the tit of the system, the corrupt system that harms ALL who participate through inflation, rent seeking, bail outs and bail ins, and so much more. 
And you have the nerve to call Bitcoin, which is based on strict adherence to mathematical code... corrupt.
Don't you dare include your analysis of Tether which is just a cryptographic version of the current banking fractional reserve system (but with actually better backing than shitty banks) to Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the hardest money we've ever seen as a civilization. Finite in supply. In 8.5 years Bitcoin will be at around .6% monetary inflation, while the dollar is experiencing who knows how much monetary inflation. I've searched for the data and can't decipher it. The USD has 2% price inflation, but likely closer to 3 or 4% monetary inflation. (Maybe more?)

That is deflation bro. Go on YouTube and watch some videos, I don't think you understand  what inflation means my friend.
@_date: 2019-08-23 09:31:00
Interesting input bro. I think if we see major adoption over next 24 months, we may need to visit the idea much sooner than that. Lightning is amazing, but it is for small payments, not medium or large payments, and may not be for years. Scaling is a matter of on chain scaling and layer 2 scaling according to most of the Bitcoin and Ethereum main devs. It's important to think about both. 
One interesting thing is that some devs like the co-author of the Lightning Network Whitepaper, Tadge Dryja, are working on building wallet structures that will work like a lite-wallet, while still essentially running the equivalent of a full node. Pruning does this to an extent I believe, but there will be more robust solutions eventually and at that point, blocksize will not be as much of a trade-off as it is now.

LOL, you just showed your true identity Peter "hamburgers provide sustinence". How funny and ironic. I'm actually listening to one of your podcasts right now.  Not about Bitcoin. I'm a fan of yours, but your bias against Bitcoin is wrong and at a certain point you'll have to admit you are wrong. What price does Bitcoin need to hit for you to admit you are wrong about it? 
Btw if being able to protect your wealth from confiscation, send it anywhere in the world within minutes for pennies, and finally having a deflationary currency which incentivizes savings isn't utility, I don't know what is you silly goose.

What are you talking about? I don't even know if it's worth my time to address these ridiculous statements. Bitcoin is divisible by 100,000,000 times. There is NO need to print more to match the demands of our economy. That is rubbish that A) Was fed to us by government so they get free money printing press. And B) Was MAYBE a concern when we used gold and gold was a hassle to divide.
You'd rather your purchasing power go down than up? Are you kidding me right now? Man you really are drinking the government kool-aid.
I don't even know what you're talking about when you say Bitcoin has inflated 60% over 12 months? Are you talking about monetary inflation or price (purchasing power) inflation? Either way, neither of those are at 60%. It's monetary inflation has been around 3.5% over last 12 months and it's purchasing power has gone UP over 100% in last 12 months, so it's actually experienced price deflation, not inflation. 
The Tether thing makes no sense at all and has very little to do with Bitcoin. 
Let's see how your USD works out for you in 5 years and how Bitcoin works out for us.

Download a Lightning Wallet and let me send you your first few bucks of Bitcoin via Lightning Network. Would be happy to young man! You can probably even post your public address (not private key, never disclose private key to anyone) here and I wouldn't be surprised if we could get you few small donations for fun!

Why not?
@_date: 2019-12-16 21:58:34
There is nothing wrong with that. People use Gold the same way. 
The difference is that over time Bitcoin can be programmed to become more usable as day to day currency, while Gold really can't without major centralization. 
When volatility settles, and we have more advancements in scaling like Lightning Network and other solutions that are currently in the works, Bitcoin will be used more for day to day purchases. 
For now store of value and speculation is a great bootstrap use case.

Luke's views are often very extreme, and while he is a great guy, most people disagree with him on lowering blocksize.
@_date: 2019-12-16 21:54:38
Yes this is correct. What do you think is more likely given the vast superiority of Bitcoin to the other options... USD, Venezuelan Peso, or any of the other weak fiat currencies? 
My bet is currently strongly with Bitcoin, but this could change if something exponentially better comes along. I see that as unlikely. Bitcoin has built enough of a network effect and has such strong qualities that it seems very unlikely that any new crypto could displace it. 
Governments could start to compete with it by lowering inflation of their own digital currencies they will create, which would be good for society, but I just don't see them giving up their printing power. They'd rather milk it to the last possible minute when things crash, that seems evident.
@_date: 2019-12-19 19:11:23
Very little gold is used in industry etc. Gold price is due to speculators and hodlers, not because of it's uses in industry. 
The tax thing I can't remember exactly why, but I believe if you buy jewelry it's gains are not taxed the same way say a gold ETF would be taxed capital gains. Theres more benefits, but I can't remember. 
When our government was confiscating gold, I think you were allowed to keep some gold jewelry also.

Gold's value is 90-95% speculative by most professionals estimates. Very little gold is used in jewelry or industry, and a good portion of the gold used in jewelry is also speculative and bought as jewelry for tax and other regulatory reasons.

Bitcoin is designed to have ever-reducing slight monetary inflation, but price deflation. 
In your 80 year scenario, Bitcoins monetary inflation will be approximately 0.0000017166%. If it is still around in 80 years, it will be forced to continue to rise in price, increasing your spending power, due to some simple facts like: 
1. The population is growing. 
2. Wealth and production are growing.
USD is designed to lose value. 
Bitcoin is designed to gain value.
Take your pick, I know where I'm holding majority of my wealth. 
All fiat currencies have collapsed, no matter how dominant. See history.

@_date: 2019-12-11 18:50:48
Wait I'm still confused. 
Bitclub was a cloud mining group. They basically rent out or host equipment and take a cut of the profit for their troubles... is the cut fair? Probably not, but people agreed to the terms. 
CEO talking shit on stupid investors is bad taste, but not illegal.
I am not defending their actions as ok, but wondering if this is a place for regulators to step in or not. 
Did they actually deceive investors or are they just being busted for it "being a security" because they took investor money to invest in their business and essentially pay dividends?  Let's make sure if we are shitting on them, we are shitting for the right reasons. 
Thanks for responses in advance :)
