Main rule of thumb, if your satisfied with your portfolio, your doing it wrong.

Even if, or when, national digital currencies become a (big) thing,  there will still be a decent handful of people who'd appreciate something like bitcoin.

ridiculous reason, cost average wouldn't mean shit if the base investment is minimal (i.e risk/reward calculated).
e.g a $1k buy at  is better than a 5k buy @ 10000, am i wrong?

Thanks, do the post office re-loadable cards accept crypto-currency reloads?

Thanks for the help, yeah i usually use those sites for bills, was more looking for an every day visa debit card for crypto currencies. I am aware that the US and most European countries have them.

Maybe your in too deep, hold a balance that you feel comfortable forgetting about. Greed is the only reason why your stressing rn

BTC would be roughly $2T in capital if it hit $100k. Keeping to a 30-39% ratio, crypto market would have to be pushing $5-7T+ .. roughly the size of the banking market rn
As i write this, it seams doable.

All launchpad icos are paid for with BNB (listings), and all launchpad icos require BNB to invest (ico sale). Its almost fraudulent.
@_date: 2018-11-19 06:04:33
right.. i dare say you should look into it, hyper inflation and cost are usually proportional.

what happens for those who never put money in to begin with? Are they still taxable without initial investments? e.g airdrops/deposits
@_date: 2018-11-18 13:29:33
It does make sense, and to a greater extent completely viable. 
I've personally joked about this situation to others.. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 07:37:28
2 part question - 
a) whats the average tax rate?
b) Are all withdrawals or fiat exchanges added up and included, are people able to withdraw small portions unscathed?

@_date: 2018-07-30 21:12:06
Yes saudi arabia is involved
@_date: 2018-07-28 23:24:28
Don't spend it all on your first exchange withdrawal :)

Poll: will we konk out at 9k-9.5, or are we gonna push 15k again?
@_date: 2018-07-30 23:53:32
I don't place confidence in that kind of signal anymore, you know you can buy or sell into your own offer right?
