People who have been jokingly saying 21SoldSoFar are waaaaay off. It's more like 210SoldSoFar. That comes out to roughly $500,000 per node.

A fourth point. 
I went short XBT before this announcement at 465 sensing this community would dump Bitcoin (aka sell by spending at BitPay vendor), and it's paying off. Sell pressure will persist because this is a popular merchant. I'll cover at 401 before I get fucked by halvening. Thanks r/bitcoin for the rumor posts that got me ahead on this trade.

I was skeptical for years after reading all the FUD here. Tried for the 1st time last month, and it worked well. I asked the counterparty during the transaction why they use Purse, and he said MTurk. I still find it hard believe that there's no fraud there with the 15%+ discount and all, but they've stuck around long enough to show it's safe.

That's not how it works. Hodlers cream their panties when they see Steam, spend, and wonder why price dropped. This time they're blaming price manipulation but it was actually Bitpay dumping &amp; a few shrewd traders who saw this film before.

Correct. Coins.ph is the most popular Bitcoin app here, followed by rebit. No one uses Abra because a remittance app only works if someone can remit to it. If Coinbase enters, they'll probably win.

@_date: 2016-11-27 03:54:43
Purse.io is the only option that makes sense. If you're going to use Gyft or eGifter, use a rewards credit card directly on Amazon.
Also try out Buy Now (5% discount). I haven't used it myself, but I hear it's just like shopping on Amazon. I always use the wish list to save between 15 and 20%.

@_date: 2016-11-05 15:30:16
Purse.io is one of the slickest ways to do this. Buy an Amazon gift card for cash at your neighborhood drugstore then go to the Earn section on Purse. 
You'll pay 11-15% markup in the beginning, but no personal info required. Bitcoin is delivered when items are delivered (1-2 days of you have Prime). Once you do enough transactions, email support and request VIP. VIP on Purse allows you to pay 1-6% markup by getting exclusive access to best deals. For VIP Earners, Purse can be cheaper than Coinbase.

Oh that's nothing. I buy American electronics that aren't available in my country or are marked up 2-3x. Getting ~17% discounts lately. After paying JohnnyAir to forward packages, I'm still getting a better deal than Americans who shop directly on Amazon. What's 1% when I'm saving 50%+? I'd pay way more fees for more features like blocking earners who cancel.

What do you think about Extension Blocks? How does it compare?
@_date: 2016-10-10 11:15:17
Just checked. It's about 2% total fee when saving 17%. 15% net discount on Amazon is a good deal in my book. I was turned off to Purse for a while because of FUD. Been using for ~6 months and noticed they're getting better. I don't remember 1% fees, but I can pay for better features. Also, I don't think you can build a profitable business charging only 1%.

OpenBazaar is that neighbor who's constantly having garage sales. Always makes a big deal and posts signs everywhere, but when you go, it's just garbage.

I've concluded it was too much trouble to use just to buy some over priced crap.  Spent hours just to get the damn client working, and all I see is crap no one wants.  Ping me when they figure out anonymity so I can get the good stuff :P

purse.io is another option. buy amazon gift cards with cash and convert to bitcoin. no need to trust someone else, transactions are escrowed.
@_date: 2017-05-01 14:58:08
nope, it's shitcoins
@_date: 2017-05-29 15:55:44
One more thing, we need to clarify our stance correct here. We used to discourage HF pre-2017 in favor of SF (SegWit). I was onboard with that. What's our view on the NY agreement? For or against?

Totally expected ripple after reading headline. Actually worse.

UASF is very clearly a contentious hard fork.

Kinda, not exactly. Just confused by what we're actually advocating :/
@_date: 2017-05-29 23:00:36
It seems all miners want is guaranteed block size increase. Not SegWit first, then mb a HF later. As soon as Barry offered, it was accepted. We should be wary of those who did not accept, namely Ver, BitGo and Blockstream.

Thanks for the insight! I agree cover asicboost is serious problem.

I literally won't spend unless I get a discount and repurchase right away.

Folks, beware of politicized propaganda. It distracts from intellectual thinking. Judge based on technical merit -- it's what got us this far.
@_date: 2016-10-10 10:43:24
How is this any different from the 100+ ICOs?

THIS. Tried again, still same bug. Not sure why I keep trying.

No but that works on Purse.io

This sub is going tard like the other one. Bitmain signed, Blockstream didn't. Consensus is hard. UASF!

But seriously, 2mb is only going to buy us a short amount of time. EXTBLK FTW

Well you don't want toxic people bc they pollute community, even in open source development. Saw Linus do that a few times in linux. I can think of a few bitcoin core devs that seem batshit...

Had some hiccups over several versions (NaN). Finally got it working after pasting stuff in terminal. Then found nothing to buy. So I tried to sell sunglasses. With Shopify / eBay, I net $15k per month. On OpenBazaar, I didn't get a single sale for first 3 months. 
If someone anyone bought since, I don't know about it (I uninstalled a few months ago). Which got me wondering...what happens if someone buys my stuff? Do I still get the sales? Or did my shop go down when I uninstalled? Checked my wallet, no bitcoins yet...
@_date: 2016-07-27 00:03:30
I have fixed costs plus shipping. Nets $3-4k. Had bitcoin enabled for years, no one pays with it.

Don't let the millions in the Y axis fool you. 8.5M KES is roughly $84k. That's $12k per day. Kenya has a population of 44M... trading volume is roughly 0.

True dat. If OB had any sense, they'd talk to merchants and realize most don't care about marketplace fees. Get me sales, and I'd happily pay fees.
@_date: 2016-07-02 21:08:31
so these OB listings are any different?

UASF is basically clever marketing. It's nodes if anything, and ultimately, miners that activate SegWit on UASF.

One of these days, Brian is going to wake up and decide Coinbase is no longer a Bitcoin company and switch to Ethereum altogether.
