Dollar cost averaging with this money. 
Use your 10k stash to buy a small amount of BTC every week or month (something line 300$/month) this method of investment (it’s not trading) is imho the best to approach BTC. 
Then you need to do 2 things AND IT’S MANDATORY : 
1_ Buy a cold storage wallet to put your BTC in and protect your investment. 
2_ Buy and READ « the Bitcoin Standard » by Saiffedean Ammous, to understand the nature of BTC and the reason why you got in. 
Once you understand fully the global situation and the solution BTC can provide, then you’ll be ready to invest the rest of your savings if you still want to.

How can I buy Bitcoin in Europe without KYC ?
I mean, not in a shop or via Localbitcoin but with an app or over an Internet site.

I honneslty hope what you describe is going to happen but ... have you ever earded about quantitave easing ? 
All the 3 majors central bank (FED, Bank of Japan and European central Bank) are running the press full speed since more than 3 years... until recently they print 80 BILLIONS every 3 month making all our properties, assets, savings worth nothing just to buy toxic assets from TBTF banks. 
And... no one even care !
I'm personnaly convince that BTC (or any decentralized crypto) is the solution BUT it seems thats every people around me prefer get their head stuffed in sand and wait for their asses to be stuffed. 
Sad to live in mu head ��

Quantitative easing is happening now, and it's not in Venezuela. 
The stock market is being kept alive only with the helicopter money dropped for free by the central banks. It allow for banks too big to fail to "disguise" their account book and thats was the reason stock market grow up no matter what. 
Thing is, J. Yellen decide the party is over and try to reduce the QE (reason why stock market plummet since february)
My point is I'am not a economist but i aware of those infos meaning anyone who care a minimum and with a normal brain can understand the level of deeeeep shit we and our children are into and .... BTC market just get rekt over and over
I'm hoping for mass adoption but i fear it wont happen

Hum look like a shitty article...
First, Charles Gave has never been a politics, he’s an entrepreneur and economic teacher. 
Second, the riots are more about the distortion of taxes between the poor/middle class and the upper class. 
On the same year, Macron decreased the social aids for the poorer and ... just canceled the ultrawealthy taxe. 
Rising price of gas by hiking the taxes (while the gas price is at one of the lowest) to fund his gift to big corporations (doubling down a gift that have been proven to be economically bad from 20 to 40 BILLIONs euros)...
So, yes Bitcoin is one of the best way out of this rigged system but i’m afraid the yellowvest protesters are a bit too in misery to want to think about it (sadly)
