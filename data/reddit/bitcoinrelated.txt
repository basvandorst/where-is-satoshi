I mean it's not to late to back down. Why not just sell and run away with the little you have left. Yeah it may not be much now compared to before, but it's something. I'm stressing over losing money, thinking fuck me. But I then see post like this, and know it could be a lot worse. 
You're not the only one in this situation. I think this whole crash is like the modern day great depression for people who put up there life savings. You must take into account though, that this is not over. If you look at the history of bitcoin prices, this has happened before. Maybe not so much as it is now, but it has bounced back.
So though it's hard, don't lose hope. It's not the end of this just yet. It has jumped between $60-124USD/BTC but remember, it is yet to be down to zero. So though you might have lost a few hundred, maybe thousands, you haven't lost all of it just yet. Go outside for a walk, have a cig, kick back. Just breath.
Shit could be worse.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:39:06
Yes exactly, which in a way is good. You have options. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 05:43:34
Oh okay cool. That's more then enough. Thanks for the prompt response. I want to get into trading, and not just holding. I feel I could have made a few extra bucks if I did these past few days. 
One last question, can I transfer money out? Say to bitfloor, so I can use there bank of america money transfer out to get my USD? 
Edit: Never mind, found my answer. Looks like it's best if I just spend all my USD unless I open up a Dwolla account, which I would still have to get verified in order to do a withdrawal. But might look into OKpay.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:35:57
Oh yeah, I'm full aware of that. But if you're trying to evade taxes, it's best to stay off the books. That's just my thought. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 06:38:46
Oh no don't tell me that. I was having high hopes as it would be a simple process. So did they like put a freeze on your account or something?
@_date: 2013-04-19 03:31:33


Best thing he said. I'm really glad to see he's so supportive on it, and trying to inform Google CEO of it. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:13:04
Also seems to be new. Though it was only just made with no traffic as of yet :/
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:50:48
Oh wow that is far. As far as I know there is the option of a wire transfer, but probably through boa. I know they also have the option to transfer money via capital one PGP, but you'd have to open an account with then. Which they say is free. I just don't know the process. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:13:09
Your best bet to avoid all fees would be to trade locally. Though that's not easy. You can always try and hit up your cities subreddit to see if there is anyone willing to trade. If not, you're going to have to do a cash deposit, or bank transfer. Lots of sites are lagging right now, so you may want to wait it out. Though this would be a great time to buy. Try bitfloor, or bitinstant, MT Gox or other similar ones. Start small and work your way up, as it's a bit of a learning curve. But believe it or not, it's pretty simple. Since you've already set up wallets, you're already half way there.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:14:29
[Same here]( well 500 USD. This is when I, like many, thought it would continue to increase. To think I could have just waited two or three hours and brought it for half of what I spent. I guess now we just have to ride through this storm.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:39:56
Yeah I keep trying to just wait it out. On one point I think, well shit I just lost $500 dollars, but another I think it's a hell of a ride for my generation to even experience. It's exciting to be part of non the less. Think about what everyone is even trying to do. It's pretty crazy, but also so very intelligent at that same note. 
I've come to terms with the possibility of the loss. I don't want to just sell, because there is a possibility of a bounce back. Either way it's a gamble. But lets face it, we all knew that getting into it. I'm just trying to ride through the storm like many others. No storm last forever right?? 
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:35:18
I'm right there with you. At the same time I wish I wasn't at work right now. I would be doing a lot of trading right now if I could. $ 60/BTC so tempting. I mean it's bound to jump up to 100 today. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 06:54:50
Yeah I agree. I've been looking into Dwolla, and OKpay, but yeah all this verification process seems a bit much. Even Bitfloor wants an ID to withdraw. Though that's all they ask for. Just ID. Not ID, and utility bill, DNA sample, figure prints, high school yearbook photo and all the other bs others ask for. It sucks. I wanted bitcoin to work for anonymity.
@_date: 2013-04-13 07:40:30
Yes this is exactly what I wanted to do, unfortunately Bitcoin-QT continues to give me countless problems and is never able to fully sync with the blockchain.
There's always a 'failure to write block' error. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 04:28:53
Yeah you're right.
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:35:31
Yeah same here, glad you posted this though. Since now I don't have to spam bitfloor as everyone else probably is. Still waiting to hear an update though. It sucks. Today I just sold two BTC. Since I thought it was a right time. Then I come home to this. I really hope they find a way to get back up and running.
@_date: 2013-04-17 23:54:10
Just to clarify I meant convert your USD for BTC. What I meant to write was buy, not sell. I didn't catch that until now.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:24:03
Yeah this, seriously the best bet. It's just hard to find local sellers. You can look into localbitcoins.com though, or check your city subreddit to see if there are others willing to do business with you.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:32:25
Hey man, sorry for your loss as well. I hear countless of stories like this. Gladly it's never happened to me. Only one transaction with them took 32 hours, which I was freaked out as well. Someone made a post like this yesterday, and u/bitinstant hopped on board and resolved many peoples issue. Try shooting them a PM, and maybe you can get a faster response. As of today, I successfully made a transaction (before the crash) so maybe things are back on track. Hard to say though, since I'm assuming lots of people are buying. Good luck.
@_date: 2013-04-13 07:46:48
I've been reading up on this one currently. I may give it a try. Thanks.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:04:17
Oh wow. Dude that blows. :/
Maybe bitinstant is your best bet then. You could have luck with it right now, or try to do a local buy. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:38:10
Yeah I think it varies with everyone. There's no set time. You're right though. They should really update that. But I think if they were honest, and were all like; look it may take 30 mins or it may take a week. Then people would all be like fuck that, and never use there business. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 22:50:05
Hey question: Why is it that blockchain is currently pricing one BTC at $99? I mean yeah I get the 4% markup fee, but that shouldn't be $99 for a coin where it's at $77 right now, should it? 
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:37:46
Yeah that's a good point. Maybe they should just open ~~trading~~ selling for the night. So we all can just convert our USD to BTC and bail. Might be a better solution for both parties.
@_date: 2013-04-16 06:39:50
Tell me about it. I think it way harder turning coin into fiat. Sucks man. Yeah I looked into them as well. Only thing is, the closest seller is like 40miles away.
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:57:32
Yeah this would have avoided a lot of mess. They could have just been like;
*Look shit might be going down this afternoon. Don't ask, shit is just fucked up right now. Buy (edit, I didn't mean sell, I meant buy.) and bail your BTC out to your wallet. We'll update later.*
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:58:22
This was great. I definitely lol'd. Imagine years from now when someone asks your kid how they learned of bitcoin. Better yet, imagine your kid explaining that to others at his age. It's a really good way you put it. I feel like I'm talking to a wall when explaining to people what bitcoin is. Maybe I'll start to use your analogy. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 22:51:09
By the way OP, really hope you get this resolved. I feel it's a gamble to even consider depositing through them right now, but I want to get in while it's low. I would do a bitfloor deposit at BoA, but they're closed.
I feel like blockchain is really a gamble. Some people get there transaction completed quickly, some don't. So far I've had success three times. With the exception of one taking 36 hours. I wish banks were open longer, as I've found bitfloor still to be more trust worthy, and faster.  
@_date: 2013-04-16 15:40:54
Hey, not sure about coinbase, but I do remember reading about needing to be verified in there TOS. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:20:52
Yeah bitfloor went well for me yesterday, and if you're thinking anonymity, deposit at the bank drive through. Usually the teller won't even bother asking for ID, because it just prolongs your transaction, and they just want to get you in and out. But, if it's past 5pm your time, it won't show until like 8am-9am the next day. This happened to me last night. So just keep that in mind.  
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:58:54
I went through bitinstant this afternoon before the crash, took 30mins to show up on my account. Now again this was before the crash, assuming there is a high increase on buying right now, it may take longer. You can also try bitfloor. Don't do it after 5pm though, since they seem to only process transactions during business hours. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 05:38:54
Thanks. How much is your limit per day? Or do they show that pretty clear on the site?
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:46:58
I'm not sure. It would be nice of another company to do so, but assuming bitfloor has gotten into some legal issues, I'm pretty sure there actions are being controlled by the authorities at this point. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 15:42:08
Can you cash out a money pack, or just use it for purchases at Walmart etc. That's the only downfall I feel about money packs. Like can even use it to pay bills?
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:11:51
If I created it, I would have no problem with admitting to do so. If I thought about creating it, trust me I would have.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:39:12
Yeah, usually they stay open along with the normal bank hours. Though some may go over a bit later. Say 30 mins. I would wait until the morning. It seems like a pretty legit way to get coin. I'm not sure what Drive-up Night Deposits are. I can only assume they are talking about using the ATM for deposits. Say you deposit your check, or some money to your account.
By the way you should know, when you transfer into bitfloor, it doesn't automatically convert it into coin. You then just have USD in your account. With that, you then have to trade USD for coin. I didn't know this before I initially used them. Though that could be a good thing. Since if the market is not at your favor, you can wait it out, and buy when it's at a good price. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:20:42
How long has it been since you deposited your money?
@_date: 2013-04-17 23:26:17
Seems like it. This sucks though. I really thought bitfloor was trustworthy. I mean they don't nearly ask as much info as MT GOX does. That's why I wanted to stick with them. Now I'm really thinking about just going to GOX, starting the process to verifying with them, and wait my two weeks to get approved. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:59:54
Go with bitfloor. It's your best bet right now. Especially since Bank of America is now open. I think it's a bit more reliable.
