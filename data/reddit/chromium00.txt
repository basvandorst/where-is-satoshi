Didn't drop as much as I expected after hitting 12 too. There were tons of sell orders at 12.

Great point, I've been thinking this same thing alot this week. 
Bloomsburg has been talking up Bitcoin all day and it's popping up in their terminals which means wall Street is aware and we now have big time investors flooding the market. 
The more Bitcoin grows the less it makes sense as a currency but the more it looks like investing into a stock to short and day trade on. 
I personally would be very cautious as we continue.

I think because no one wanted the fork

Wouldn't one of the biggest arguments of why bitcoin will never be a future more popular currency be these forks? So if you own 5 bitcoin, at the time of the s2x fork, you have 5 btc and 5 s2x, so technically now you just made 100% profit for just holding some bitcoin in an exchange. 
Unless i'm mistaken, but I can't find a good way to argue this as "bitcoin gives you free cash"

Ohhh okay so it's basically a graph of the order book?

I'm expecting a bit dip at 10k by just looking at this current [order book]( but i'm sure more will buy a the dip to bring it back to 10k.

It's a screen cap from GDAX. If you have an account you can also see the order book.

I get this reference.

Can someone explain the depth chart to me? I don't understand it.
