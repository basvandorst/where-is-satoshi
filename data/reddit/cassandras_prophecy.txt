I support Bisq and atomic swaps , I think they are great for the consumer and crypto in general , but if you are a BTC maximalist consider the following:
On centralised exchanges BTC is used as the main crypto trading pair. 
This gives bitcoin a lot of power and increases its value because if you wish to trade two coins that are not paired you often have to purchase BTC first.
Decentralised exchanges and atomic swaps remove this advantage.
Be careful what you wish for.
With network backlogs and fee difficulties one of few things that is maintaining BTC price recently is speculation, not just in BTC but in un-matched trading pairs.

You pay fees now which are significantly lower to reduce the size of a future transaction which may cost 500 sat/b.

The details given in my comment are why it has and maintains that liquidity.

Or your statement is a misuse of statistics which indicates the poor are subsidizing the fees for the rich.

Time to consolidate your coins.
If you have a BTC balance that is lower than the average transaction fee during the last five months, now may be a good time to move your coins to an exchange or shapeshift into a currency that accommodates the use of smaller values.

The number of transactions being submitted for confirmation  has dropped this week and it is the only reason the mempool is clearing. This isn't yet outside normal variance.
However as I write this less than 3 transactions a second are being created.
Go to blockchain.info and you can literally count them being added.
* 425,000 January 5th   
* 337,000 Jan 11th 
* 240,000 today

There is no problem with the wallet. This is user error.
The copay wallet isn't an intermediary before it is sent to cold storage.
This is a Bitcoin network issue caused by congestion and fluctuating high fees.
It is sad that this topic is 93% upvoted.
It just means that this sub is so controlled that new users and the resident users have no idea how wallets , fees or the network functions.

This is important news and it's getting down voted heavily?
Many people may not like it, but it is happening and the  wider community needs to know. 
Especially users in this sub who only seem to discuss positive events and price memes.

Is this quadratic hashing problem?
It was only a problem if you were averse to performing a hard fork upgrade of the network.
During the BCH fork the quadratic hashing problem was mitigated via the new SigHash type that was used to enable replay protection.
**EDIT**: It was what he was talking about. 
A bit more info on the quadratic hashing problem.  
The actual problem isn't about block size.
The amount of data we have to actually process grows quadratically based on the size of the transaction not the size of the block. You could craft special transactions so that a 1MB block, containing 1 or 2 transactions would end up hashing about 20000 times.
Bigger blocks do not result in larger transactions which means bigger blocks will not cause quadratic slowdowns.
