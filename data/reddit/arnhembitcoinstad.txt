If a tablet stand runs Bitpay it surely isn't running BitKassa. Do you remember where you saw it?
In 98% of the situations BitKassa does not deliver any hardware at all. Shop owners use their own device with BitKassa.

Yeah it might be Bitstraat, they do use Bitpay a lot. Campsite in Norway accepting bitcoins, thats nice!

Hi there,
We just noticed this tread and I have to say that it crossed our minds to ask the bitcoincommunity for support. But people get asked for btc-donations all the time these days, and since this is not really a life-saving subject we decided not to openly ask for donations for this project.
However if you do like to support this project and make sure the students get some more BTC you can donate to this address: 1REDDitu5vUW9YMW5GneTkywV1QZ9znKh
On Monday morning (dutch time) all the students will get information about how they can install a wallet on their phone and how they can submit their address to us.
On Wednesday we will distribute €2,- worth of bitcoin to each wallet from our own address plus an equal share of the donation address for each student. If you like to donate the students directly you can follow the blockchain trail to find out the addresses of the 500 students. Of course any donation is highly appreciated as we are trying hard to set up a bitcoinhotspot here in Arnhem. Follow us on twitter ( we will ask the students to send pictures to 
To answer an other question that got asked here: Usually a beer costs between €2,20 - €2,40 at the bars that accept Bitcoin. There is one bar that will give the student a full pint for just €2,- of bitcoins. These discounts are only valid for a week. However, some other merchants offer students who pay wit Bitcoin a 10% discount on their products (sandwich shop and a smoothie/juice bar) for 6 or 12 months.

Why do you think that? BitKassa is a stand alone tool that offers the same services as bitpay but has nothing to do with bitpay or any other payment provider.

We like to take it one step at a time. Even with Bitcoin it's hard enough already to convince people to be open minded about this and give it a try. 
 
Remember, out there in the mainstream economy, people are still barely aware of Bitcoin (let alone other coins) and there's tons of skepticism and misunderstanding. Let's just bring Bitcoin mainstream first, before confusing people even more.

That has to be another Spar :) This one is pretty new as it opened march 2014

This is good news! What is your role in this story? According to coinmap.org there are other merchants accepting bitcoins in Manilla. Including a restaurant called "silk road" :-)
@_date: 2015-01-24 16:42:24
Thanks. Too bad though. Would be nice to see someone putting an effort into getting more merchants in Manilla to accept bitcoins.

It will be a pleasure to meet you all here!
@_date: 2015-08-07 08:18:04
You should do that :) And believe it or not, you would not be the first bitcoin user to do so because of it.
Otto de Voogd did just that and he's now paying his rent with bitcoins as well :-) (we call him the bitcoin refugee)

Because of regulations (VAT especially)?

Wow, thanks for the donations! 0.29151952 BTC!
You can check the blockchain on august 26th to see how many students signed up to receive bitcoins.

We love how Bitcoin grows and matures and the discussions that come along with it. Like anyone who is involved with Bitcoin, not every step is good for our particular project, but we can't wait to see where Bitcoin will be in a few years. We're quite confident that one way or the other it will be possible to do secure point-of-sale cryptocurrrency transactions and we like it to be Bitcoin for as long as possible.

Cool, you might be the first German who has paid a coffee in Arnhem! We've had more German visitors since then. At least one German couple stayed at the Modez Hotel and paid with Bitcoins :)

This is Poland, so things like a Bitcoin City are possible over there :)
@_date: 2015-08-07 12:03:53
lol, we're so bitcoin minded that a hint like that completely flies by :)
@_date: 2015-08-07 14:51:56
You can HODL your savings and just buy a few new ones to store in your mobile wallet. Repeat when empty. That way you help the Bitcoin economy without worrying you have spent your last bitcoin when bitcoin hits the moon :)
@_date: 2015-08-07 07:55:12
Thanks! Maybe you can join us some time at one of the meetups from the Arnhem Bitcoin User group.
@_date: 2015-08-07 08:00:14
Thanks! We'll try to snap a few pictures august 26th, so you can see the group of students who received the coins :)

Thanks, we've added it to our donation address:

See nearly 100 merchants accepting 0-conf here:
This kind of projects are at risk when RBF becomes common. While paying on the streets with bitcoin might not be what bitcoin was specifically designed for, it sure creates a whole lot of awareness. No one sees you paying an online order while we get a lot of questions about Bitcoin when I pay our groceries with it.

Great to read. It is still so small, but this snowball will probably grow for a while. Great to be a witness of these times indeed.

Right [here]( :)
@_date: 2015-10-11 05:29:53
Yes, a good review! Since this article we have about twice as much merchants that accept bitcoin now :)

Hi there! A trip by railway will take you here in just less than one hour (from Amsterdam). If you are in for a chat with some local bitcoin users just let us know when you will be here and we'll have a drink or so. btw: Sandwich shop Mo Lon offers bitcoin users a free soda with a sandwich. There are multiple very interesting merchants, depending what you're in to. The city center is relatively small so a walk from one end to the opposite can be done in about 15 minutes.
