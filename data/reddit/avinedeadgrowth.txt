Yeah it's possible, in a hundred years it could be rather limited, people could die without leaving their families any way to access their wallets and tons of coins could be lost

There are no guarantees in the crypto market, though I'd say just holding it for a few years will give you gains. That's just my opinion, it could tank tomorrow for all anyone knows.

Transfer your bitcoin from your electrum wallet back to the exchange you bought it from( or a different one) and sell it. Some exchanges buy it back at market price, others you need a buyer on the other end who puts in a bid at a certain price

Yeah, send it back to coinbase and coinbase buys it back at market price without needing a buyer.

Hope this works out for you, if it's any peace of mind I've heard plenty of stories like this happening. People with large sums of money having their account locked for months unexplained. I followed a lot of those stories and they seem to always get sorted out where the funds are accessible again. Good luck.

Like everyone else said, call your credit card company, mine blocked my first purchase thinking it was fraud. I called and authorized changes, now I don't have any problems using it. Once and done. Though it is cheaper to pay out of your bank account, something to consider.

I personally have a ledger blue. Ledger nano s and trezor are also good options. I believe the ledger nano s is the cheapest of the 3. I prefer ledger products over Trezor simply be cause ledger supports the storage of a larger variety of Cryptocurrencies.

No? $1,000,000 per BTC would be 1 cent satoshi
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:26:27
Yeah, though most of the time I only hear it happening to people who send and receive large sums of money through their bank

Is it a good wallet? Yes. Is it safe to keep your coin there? It is as secure as the computer you run it on, malware could result in your private keys being stolen. If you don't visit shady sites and have a good anti virus it should be alright, but that's up to you. For complete peace of mind buy a hardware wallet such as ledger or Trezor, or look up how to generate a safe paper wallet.

When you store bitcoin on an exchange, you won't hold your private keys. You need them to access your coins. The exchange shows you how much you're storing and that is basically an iou. If the exchange gets hacked or exit scams, you lose everything. Google mt gox.
Having coins in your own wallet means you own the private keys. But if the device your wallet is on is connected to the internet then it is possible for malware to steal your private keys, whuch means someone will steal your bitcoin. The wallet is only as secure as the device running it. 
Storing on a hardware wallet is your best bet. It generates the seed phrase for your private keys offline so they are never exposed. The device connects to computer but never reveals your private keys to it, therefore keeping your coins safe from malware.

I've never used it but I have heard they are reputable, though they seem to have a higher market price compared to other exchanges

Same, that's my cash out price, enough to by a decent house outright after taxes

If I recall correctly coinmama is easy to sign up for and I don't think they have buy limits on credit cards, I could be wrong though.

I'm fairly new to bitcoin myself but I've made like $40 so far, I think it's very promising, but what do I know haha

Reading through some posts and saw your username, should have figured you'd be on board with bitcoin
