That would be pretty funny if it were funny.

This is a really interesting idea.  +1 for a creative attempt at solving one of the biggest problems regarding bitcoin adoption.

For some reason(possibly incorrect), I assumed there would be a delay in setting up a MtGox account, and funding it.  Could I do this all relatively fast?  Just want some bitcoins within the shortest time frame as possible and with the least delay between placing the order &amp; receiving the bitcoins, as I don't want to purchase them at 80$ only to have them be $50 when I receive them.  
  
Asking a lot I know, and am absolutely aware I will probably find nothing quite so ideal.  Still any thoughts are appreciated.  
  
EDIT: Ah, I assumed verification was necessary, and don't have the documentation with me.  Setting up an account now.  
  
EDIT 2: no clue how to fund the account in a timely fashion.

:/ I am basically a transient.  I haven't lived at the address my bank account is under in years.

I think this only applies for transactions over a given volume?  Western union &amp; bitfloor, etc  are much more anonymous that a lot of the more high volume markets.

My bank is unfortunately in the US.  Not even sure I could convince them to do a wire transfer remotely.
