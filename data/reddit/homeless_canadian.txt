I hate how neither website lists the fees unless I create an account and start a transaction.

Citizens can only leave with $500 USD and no more. And if they use a credit card abroad, they have to pay a 35% surcharge (because then Argentina has to send US reserves to pay the foreign debts).

Yes, exactly. Mark-up from "official price", but not from "market price" lol

Actually, coinbase might work. Allows my family member to buy bitcoin with bank account, and then send it to me. But I believe it says it takes 4 days for the bitcoin to be bought, is that correct? They also ask for an awful lot of personal information.

I don't see why I would. Isn't this an "online wallet", risking that the middle-man can steal all my funds?

No, you don't get it. The rate of 8 ARG for 1 USD is not real. You will not be able to find anyone that will sell you 1 USD for 8 ARG in Argentina. It's an entire fucked-up situation where the government forbids people from owning and trading in USD. So the only way to buy USD is from individuals, and it costs 12 ARG to buy 1 USD right now, if you find anyone desperate enough who will even sell their USD.
 By next year, this will probably be 15 ARG or more. ARG is deflating at an incredible rate. When I was in Argentina in 2011, the exchange was 4.5 ARG for 1 USD. But the government passed a law banning citizens from purchasing USD. And if you are a citizen trying to leave the country with more than $500 USD, they will confiscate your money, because they want to keep all USD in the country to prop-up the failing national banks. Instead of using gold or bullion to back-up the value of the ARG, Argentina relies on a stash of USD to keep the ARG currency from failing.
I don't think any other country in the world is doing something this insane. So bitcoin will be a life-saver for Argentineans that want their money to retain value over the years. They can cross borders without the airport guards confiscating the money, because it is all online.

I tried localbitcoins and the people are few and far from the city core. MyCelium and Coinbase look like services for retailers to accept bitcoin, not sure how my family member would use it to buy bitcoin.
