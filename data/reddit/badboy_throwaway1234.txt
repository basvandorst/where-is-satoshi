Gold is also, you know, a real fucking thing. Its a tangible asset you can hold in your hands.
Meanwhile when the internet and electricity goes out your BitCoin is useless.

Yes, but thats besides the point of discussion here.
The topic is about value. In a hypothetical no internet no electricity scenario, bitcoin has no value. Zero. None.
Gold will always have value, it has since nearly the beginning of human history. You can trade it for tangible necessities of life like food, water, shelter, tools, etc.

I didn't invest my entire life savings into crypto because of memes so I think ill be okay

Sunk cost fallacy. We're done here. I hope your electrons maintain their value.

And what do you think the distribution of BTC or other crypto will be?
Those who have the means, resources and capital to mine it will hoard it for themselves.
@_date: 2019-10-16 14:44:24
And exactly how much energy are we going to waste trying to mine those last 3 million for the next 120 years?
Im sure the climate will love being polluted so you can have your imaginary money.

Wow a 'u mad' response, how original and witty.
@_date: 2019-10-16 18:28:48
Again, only those with the capital to invest in the energy and computing power. Then like you said it gets distributed to those who can afford to invest in it.
No one *earns* crypto. Thus its doomed to forever be a gimmick play-thing unless a government adopts it formally as a currency.
@_date: 2019-10-16 15:16:04
Can't wait for capitalism and your "free market" to collapse.
It'll probably be the same time climate change makes human life on Earth unsustainable.
But hey at least you'll have 1s and 0s!

Curious how they're constantly shorted for gains in fiat currency...
Maybe one day Crypto will be traded as an actual currency but it isn't now and don't delude yourself of otherwise.
@_date: 2019-10-17 13:13:49
Are you delusional?
Crypto is purchased with this fiat currency. It's valued is practically backed by the fiat USD.

Can you explain bitcoin to me?
What is it that people don't know about it?
@_date: 2019-09-26 18:19:41
Bought a whole $7 worth of BTC last month.
I've lost about $1.50 I'm ruined!
Time to buy more.
