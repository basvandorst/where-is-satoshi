some philosophy worth considering:  
  
**people will put extra effort  into NOT losing money**  
   example:  
It can be argued that someone would be more likely to jump into a river to recover a 100$ bill they dropped by accident than they would if they just saw a 100$ bill floating down the river. *all other factors being equal yes they know its a legit bill and so on*
    
  
So people would be more inclined to
  
Figure out how to buy/use etc BTC to avoid paying small ammt more on fees   
rather than
they would to save a small ammt of capital  
  
  
You need to consider the relative convenience people have when they buy from you and not from your competition etc. If they dont want to pay the extra fee you want their action to be using bitcoin rather than just buying from a different vendor.  
  
IMHO if you do BOTH (5% bitcoin discount and credit card fee) perhaps this will help mitigate loss of business and should be tried first   
especially if you think that you will lose hard earned loyal customers easily to others offering the same product/service right next door     
  
long reply sorry .. does that make sense?

somebody was going to do it sometime, why not me and a little added caution to a site where theres a lot of info u need to give. ive been involved in bitcoin since 10$ and whenever people tell me what to do or not to do kinda speaks to the opposite of the freedom bitcoin brings

well i know i can do 115 V or 230 V with the bfl adapter. 
- Official BFL-manufactured PSU rated for 403 watts
- Output: 13V at 31A (2 x PCIe 6-pin power connectors)
the antminer s1 i s
Power consumption: about 360 W from the wall
Power supply: 3 +12V DC input
im looking into it now and some people say the BFL adapter is dangerous i may just buy a new power supply and power both with it

Think about the difference between a digital bearer asset and something like stealing a car
It's a lot easier to get away with stalking you until your vulnerable and torture you 2 xfer your coins than trying to get away with a stolen car likely with gps and cops on the lookout

Owning and securing Bitcoin is difficult enough last thing u want to do is advertise that you own it and invite even more risk to your wealth

There was some funny tweets from the ecb mentioning Bitcoin you can search for them 
Additionally look into the ecb and NERP and many of their other questionable monetary policy

I think that's true about the miners and nodes assumption but there are incentives to running a full node 
You can route payments through your own node and not trust any random node that gets queried by a light client 
There's others although not directly monetarily subsidized are important ex being a user on the network you signal to other nodes in the event of a UASF if you are in favor or not by which software you run 
I run a full non pruning node 24/7 it gives a small sense of doing your part as many things with Bitcoin are very technical and difficult to contribute (you can start small helping with GitHub documentations and even (like me correct a spelling error hahaha)
Run a full node with incoming connections doing your part however small is more satisfying than it seems

Nothing is guaranteed. Bitcoin could go to 0 tomorrow or a million just hold what u are comfortable with. 
Best advice I can give FWIW

I'm assuming you were around during those times to make such a declarative conclusion
Care to share your reasoning

I run a raspblitz full Bitcoin node and LN node 
The only thing I personally care about is just not photographing my IP address 
I also run core 17.1 on my dedicated miner although i haven't yet opened the ports and want as high connectivity as possible 
.. so I'm excited about libminisketch in this regard:
"Pieter Wuille, Gregory Maxwell, and Gleb Naumenko researched how to reduce the amount of data used to relay Bitcoin transactions. Their initial result is libminisketch, a library that allows one user with a set of elements (e.g. {1, 2, 3}) to efficiently send missing elements to another user who only has part of that set (e.g. {1, 3}). No changes to Bitcoin consensus are required for this—it’s just a different way of transmitting the same information. If implemented for relay, it can reduce overall node bandwidth (for a typical case) by 40% to 80%. It also keeps bandwidth low as the number of connections increases, potentially allowing nodes to make many more connections to peers in order to improve the robustness of the P2P relay network." 
I want to route transactions through MY OWN NODES and not trust other's that are offered as the default in light wallets today 
Like they are also MY KEYS I want to route through (good for opsec too) MY OWN NODE
We need people running their own nodes for many other reasons than this I'm sure many who appreciated proof of keys may find ProofOfNode just as paramount
With the rapid development of small hardware devices using rasp pi ODROID others premade Casahodl NODL and others we have a real opportunity here 
I'll leave it at that hopefully the message spreads

They are more risk averse I think

I don't remember why I wasn't surprised by that rally while a friend was worried I said this was good for Bitcoin .. prolly the reputation of it's use on SR and still being around afterwards 
Or maybe because SR got shutdown and not Bitcoin but I wouldn't say it was the biggest hindrance .. perhaps your right in those early days

An event where we celebrate Bitcoin and all it's overcome with the people working tirelessly to make this work 
We can do something to help .. it's a big deal even though it isn't difficult to get a node and running 
1 we talk about the importance of users running their own full nodes 
-connecting other wallets like mobile or even hardware wallets to your node instead of trusting their default node
✓ very important for privacy and opsec
There's a lot of really compelling reasons to run your own full node and to open ports 8333 for inbound connections to further assist the network but that's something each person has to make on their own regarding opening ports
We need nodes 
Bitcoin won't work if apathy and expecting someone else to do it 
Please help make this a reality

bringing a child into this world is not "Valid" when you are financially unprepared and thus vulnerable to an unexpected event; at LEAST have an emergency cash or equivalent saved to support your family for 6 months just incase. 
{If you think 6 months
 {of anything it doesnt have to be fiat; maybe gold} ..
 is too much to save before bringing an innocent child into this world it is obvious that person also doesnt put too much thought into how to provide a stable and nurturing environment to give the baby the best chance possible to prosper in life..
