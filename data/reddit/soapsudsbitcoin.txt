Yik Yak is a location-based anonymous twitter/reddit hybrid for college students. You can upvote and downvote posts and replies. I go to a large university and people say some funny shit.

You're thinking of the online dashboard, which is a ticker. They also have a trading platform that you link you exchange API to pull data from either Bitstamp or BTC-e and make trades. It requires a subscription too.

I'll have to go there today.

Yeah I am. We're formalizing everything now. Our basic goals are going to be:
• Educating students about bitcoin and its advantages
• Getting small business in State College to accept bitcoin and walking them through the entire process
• Bitcoin Donations to THON

A lot of people have ad block nowadays. I would love to see some examples of the "content" that they've created. I just find it hard to believe that all of these students are generating that much on a regular basis.
@_date: 2014-05-23 00:35:12
Go for it!
@_date: 2014-05-22 15:49:54
I use Pixelmator to make it. It's pretty easy to use. I would recommend checking out. They have some great video tutorials on their website. I just exported it to photoshop because most people don't have Pixelmator. 
@_date: 2014-05-23 01:16:16

I have friends who run popular blogs and and there's no way 2900 students each earn $3.84 a day from just ads. That's outrageous. What are some examples?

As someone who is in a CX role and manages a support team, Xapo's handling of this support ticket is pretty awful. Regardless of what a customer's thoughts are and if they're cursing you out, you never want to match aggression with aggression. When you do, it's bound to be posted about somewhere (Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, etc.) and it only hurts the company's image.

We have already obtained the trademark paperwork necessary for using the name "CryptoCard by MasterCoin." Thanks for your concern though.
@_date: 2013-09-04 18:41:33
Just got off the phone with my supplier. The new estimated cost will be about $10 per card.
@_date: 2013-09-03 06:14:25
The basic idea of the card isn't that you use it to pay for items. The card has no access to your physical wallet. The only information is your wallet address. If you lose your card, the most the thief could do is send your money.
@_date: 2013-09-03 06:17:20
The 30 dollar price point is just a rough guess at this point. From what our suppliers have said, it will most likely be less than that. The point of card is to let people know that bitcoin and other crypto currencies exists and that they have their advantages over standard crypto currencies. Please read over the web page for more information about the card.
@_date: 2013-09-03 12:08:43
Thanks for the feedback. I will look into other mediums, but keep in mind that the card is printed on carbon fiber, so that in itself isn't gimmicky. Stainless steel is another option too. Like I said, the 30 dollar price point is just a base, it will likely go down in price.
