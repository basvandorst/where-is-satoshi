I'm so glad to read this. Using bitcoin into a charitable way truly provides a huge difference. Hats off to Pine.

Venezuelans are taking refuge in crypto. If their country recovered and thrive thru this, I think it will have a huge impact on crypto economy.

Yes, all it takes is a matter of patience. I just love how it crashed and recovered. :D

Indeed everything is always nice when new. But I still get excited when the price of bitcoins soars. :D

Bitcoin starts the week up to $11,425 showing steady if unremarkable growth from the $10,970 it was valued at on Friday afternoon, according to Coinbase's data. Looking at it week-on-week though, that's a rise of 11.43 percent and a huge increase of 27.92 percent on this time last month.

I've been waiting for this. I believe it will now jump to a much bigger wall.

I still believe that bitcoin will replace USD as a global currency in the future. The more countries adopting it the closer we get into its real value.

I agree this is just another nonsense that opposed to decentralization.

I believe technical analysis is helpful in trading but not always in the case of  BTC as unexpected amount of volumes are added or removed. What do you think?

Bitcoin is a store of value. It may go down at times but it will always go up with a record-breaking price.

Yes I think we should know about Bitcoin won't know the difference, and would use it to tarnish Bitcoin if/when things go wrong/worst.
