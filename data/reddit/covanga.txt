I'm sorry but this has to be a joke. I don't care if you can actually make good money from this (you can't), but you're recruiting suckers to annoy people trying to get their caffeine fix. This is embarrassing. At least you got rid of that garbage logo. 
If you're trying to make bank on referrals you could be doing so much better and in a way that helps this community. It might actually take some work and initial investment, but that site could become a go to if your content was actually good.

This makes no sense. Why not provide good defaults? If miners want they can pursue even better defaults and optimization beyond it. I see no reason to not continue to improve wherever possible. 
This idea that things need to be broken or worse than optimal so other people/projects can create separate solutions does not inherently improve bitcoin. I get that decentralization is important, but at some point it seems to become counterproductive, especially in early stages of development when clear improvements can be made relatively painlessly.

"there being some local BTC vendor, some one trusted in the community who helped people apply for microloans or kept their accounts in order without everyone needing to learn"
I think some people will take that approach. And that's fine, if that's how they choose to manage their finances- by letting someone else do it for them. But with new gadgets being made and new software on phones etc, a lot of people will find it easier and easier to do it themselves. I think that's the beauty of all this. I just want to hear how people figured out what worked best for them. 
@_date: 2015-07-11 08:01:52
DAMMIT. At the very end they mention nautiluscoin. What a fucking joke. It will never succeed because the people orchestrating it are PLANNING on it to bust. It's so obvious/been done before.

found a typo:  "So it for example.." 
assuming 'it' should be 'if'
@_date: 2015-07-06 20:05:34
Honestly it normally doesn't bother me but it does this time. I think it's because the price rise is an obvious response to a situation that could lead to a lot of people suffering.

Even if they did accept bitcoin, that wouldn't be enough.

I completely agree with the 2 loaves of bread approach. Get a little and play with it. See what it's about and how it works. It doesn't take too long to figure out and it actually can be fun. (If you're not currently dealing with inflation or closed banks) 
@_date: 2015-07-09 01:30:30
This is more accurate.

When it's public facing and being linked all the time on this sub, I have every right to say something. It's not my right to force him to do anything- it's his- he can do what he wants with it. But I can say whatever I want about my opinion of what he's doing with it. 
@_date: 2015-07-06 14:04:25
See it really depends on each persons use case. Piper takes 5 minutes to setup and learn tops. I imagine Trezor is similar. The only thing with Piper is you have to store and protect valuable pieces of paper. But that's not new for most people. 
@_date: 2015-07-11 15:37:15
Yeah Auroracoin and there was one involving native American reservations. I think some people who get caught up in it and push for it to be implemented actually believe in it. But I'd be willing to bet most of the people who were involved doubted it would ever actually work and were happy to "distribute" coins to others while the hype was strong. I'm not saying they were outright scams, but they were outright scams. 
@_date: 2015-07-12 17:45:52
You're right, it does. I don't have anything to do with bitcoin.org. I was just being a dick and implying bitcoin.com needs to be improved. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 14:02:39
it wouldn't be if people did it all the time almost as an upvote. But right now tips are so infrequent even here that a 4 cent tip is yeah, a joke. 
@_date: 2015-07-12 18:13:58
This makes the process for someone who doesn't use bitcoin yet easy and familiar. They just use the site to move the first packet into a new one, and they can save it wherever they want. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 04:22:22
They aren't cutting themselves off from the internet. They can't pay for their internet services. Yes, in some ways this results in less access- but it's not like the government is purposely cutting off internet access intentionally. Title gore dude. 
That being said, the article actually makes a great point about bitcoin being a possible solution when previously popular payment systems located in other countries are not available. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 14:24:58
I imagine this is more than just an attempt to prove 1mb is too low. I agree with you though. I hope this attack was expensive. 
@_date: 2015-07-11 08:11:49
This is the best answer you'll get to that question. If you find a niche/service that is in demand in the industry, you'll see a lot of people are willing to pay with bitcoin.

How was using Trezor? I'm thinking of getting one, but using a Piper wallet has been pretty smooth for me. I print two copies, keep them in separate locations, and I check on them maybe once every few months to make sure the paper quality is good. (so far no sign of aging) But if I saw that I'd just print a new one and migrate the coins over using my phone. I conducted my own stress test on the paper before sending any significant amount to them. Even crushed the paper and the qr code still could be read with proper lighting. I personally want to make a metal paper wallet eventually. But Trezor might be the way to go.

Wow, Tracy Alloway was just shut down. They didn't even allow it to be discussed. It was not just waved away but aggressively dismissed.

I agree that the file could become something with more info so people have instructions on how to use it if they saved it 2 years ago and just recalled "oh I have that thing!" but can't remember exactly how it works. 
@_date: 2015-07-12 18:20:43
This is AWESOME. This is what I've been looking for in terms of adoption for people who aren't completely dismissive of bitcoin but don't care enough to create a wallet. 
Back in 2013 some people asked about getting like 20 bucks worth but quit at the point of having to manage their own wallet. No one likes creating more accounts online. It just sucks to do if you aren't used to using a password manager. But saving a file on dropbox is well within their comfort zone. 
Well done!

We're gonna need a bigger voat. 
@_date: 2015-07-11 08:08:43
Yeah it's tough to make a simple step by step instructions that work for everyone. There are so many ways to use/get/send bitcoin and it really depends on each person's specific situation to figure out what works best. Luckily there's this sub and bitcointalk and companies that can point people in the right direction. But it's always up to the individual to be street smart and double check that they're making the right choices. 
@_date: 2015-07-06 13:51:32
That site needs to be taken down. Roger Ver needs to hire a real designer who understands Bitcoin, or just bite the bullet and sell the domain to someone who can actually make good use of it.

What I'm talking about is having a discussion with people who figure it out, and sharing our lessons learned so we can teach it to people who are interested in also learning. We help each other out. Of course, you need to want to be helped. But when you don't know how to do something- so you seek out someone who does. If someone comes here to learn, I would hope they could see a place where people are discussing how they make it all work. That's what this post is about. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 14:22:55
This is awful. Obvious scam.

1. I think it's beneficial to point out that most people cannot and should not try to mine. Most mining nowadays is in large warehouse style mining rigs and teams of people with specialty equipment. It's an investment for people who REALLY know what they're doing.  That being said- the basic reason for mining is that it is a function to record and protect the integrity of all the transactions being made in the Bitcoin network. The bitcoins "mined" are the reward to computers for providing the electric and computational resources required to maintain the network.
2. THOUSANDS of people are doing exactly that. Because Bitcoin is open source, people have copied the code and started there own. The most popular is Litecoin. Some have interesting ideas and qualities to them. Some are even built on top of Bitcoin itself. Most are completely garbage. Even the good ones will probably never be worth much because Bitcoin solves the majority of problems altcoins solve AND it's network is vastly larger and more developed and accepted. Some people try to push their altcoin and pump it's price to attract people to buy it before selling off as much as they can. My suggestion- stay farrrr away unless you've been around the Bitcoin community for awhile and see the lifecycle of these coins. And even then 99/100 times they aren't worth messing with. 
3. bitcoins are first created by a "block" being mined. This happens around once every ten minutes. It's when a computer set up to mine finds a special number by inputting as many numbers as possible as fast as possible into a specific equation to come up with a certain kind of number. These equations make it very easy for anyone who finds a number to prove that it is the right kind of number, but very hard to find a new one that hasn't been found yet. It's like prime numbers. They are hard to find because as the numbers increase they become rarer- but once you find one you can easily prove they are a prime number. When a computer finds the number it announces to the network that it has found one and if the network accepts it, that computer is awarded a set amount of coins. **The network  (through consensus) is the entity granting new coins.** Keep in mind there is a set limit of 21 million coins. Once all of them are mined, the mining computers will only receive coins provided by transaction fees. So there will never be more than 21 million coins in existence. 
There is much more to Bitcoin than just a currency (however that is a big part of it) Each coin can have information added to it- so companies like Nasdaq are exploring its potential. Bitcoin with a capital 'B' refers to the network and technology. bitcoin with a lowercase 'b' refers to the currency/coin.

Yeah like, today. It should be pointed to bitcoin.org and reassessed. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 14:19:44
When people say stress test in this thread, they mean a DDOS attack by sending a huge amount of transactions to flood the network. It just means it will take way longer for your payments to confirm unless you increase your miner fee to gain priority. The 1mb block limit is absurd at this point and anyone who says otherwise most likely has incentives to do so that don't pertain to the direct improvement of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-07-09 00:55:36
Well THAT'S a surprise.

That's funny because I just asked google and they said it's in the works and we can expect integration any day now. Apparently they're also migrating their search engine to the blockchain and developing self driving rocketships to take us all to the ~~moon~~ mars.
