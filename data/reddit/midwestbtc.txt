Bitaccess and it is a QR reader 
@_date: 2014-07-27 22:38:30
We run our fees at a flat 5% for both buying and selling Bitcoin

Bitaccess -  They are a great team to work with for operators.

We comply with state and federal regulations, from the Money Transmitter License to the RMSB.  We have been and will absolutely be following their guidance/requirements down to the punctuation mark.
That being said, only transactions over $3000 require you to scan a piece of government-issued I.D., there is no need to record palm scans for the purpose for AML.

Our ATM is a two-way machine which means you can both buy and sell Bitcoin for cash at the ATM.
@_date: 2014-07-28 06:59:12
The machine will initially ask you for your phone number and send an SMS as an identity check. After this screen you are free to transact up to $3000 on either buying or selling Bitcoin. After the $3000 limit is reached, we require you to scan a piece of government-issued ID. This process is simple, fast, and easy if you wish to transact over a certain amount. There are no invasive techniques such as palm, hair, saliva, blood, or semen samples required in order to be fully compliant with both AML and KYC policies.

It's unfortunate that your experience was not pleasant. But the opposite has been true in our experience. The touch screen is near instant and the only wait time is dependent on 3rd party services, mainly the SMS confirmation, and if anyone would like to test our ATM at Cassava and report back here later that would be great.

It's a two-way ATM and no palm or semen sample required! Only transactions over $3000 require you to scan a piece of government-issued I.D.

This is a two-way machine (can buy and sell Bitcoin) and it is located at Cassava in Chicago: 3338 North Clark Street Chicago IL, 60657. They accept Bitcoin and make amazing empanadas and smoothies if you are able to make a visit.

Hi Anonymous Rev,
We have done everything we need to in order to comply with state and federal regulations, from the Money Transmitter License to the RMSB. We have been and will absolutely be following their guidance/requirements down to the punctuation mark.
Hope to see you at the University Park Mall soon!
Edit: We use the facecam and ID scanner and will file any large transactions as required for the sake of AML, the palm scanner is often considered intrusive and is not necessary for the purpose of AML.

Unfortunately that's something we can not readily predict. If the machine runs in to problems we are ready to service the machine within a few hours of the issue. 
As for locations, it is sometimes problematic finding locations where we can place our machines. We strive to find locations where merchants integrate Bitcoin in their own venue because it allows us to support the ecosystem by having new users be able to spend their Bitcoin in a physical/local place. That being said, if you know anyone that would be interested in hosting a Bitcoin ATM anywhere in the United States, feel free to email us at contact

This is a Bitaccess machine we installed today located in South Bend, Indiana. You can both buy and sell bitcoin through our machine. If you're interested you can find more information about us on our [website](midwestbtc.com), keep in mind the site is still under construction. If you have any questions I'd be more than happy to answer them directly.
@_date: 2014-07-27 22:20:46
Changed it for clarity, and be sure to buy with Bitcoin! Also the owner holds the Bitcoin instead of instantly converting it to fiat.

There are only two slots available, the two that are stacked on top of each other. The other one (facing the right in the picture) is blocked by a sheet of metal. The cash goes in to the second slot facing the ground. If you have ever been in contact with the machine, cash is not large enough to fit in the first slot and it is relatively self-evident after seeing the size of the first slot that the cash goes in to the second one.

We have been dealing with the regulatory hurdles for Illinois for the last few months considering one of our major goals is to have an ATM in Chicago. Currently we are also scouting for locations if anyone has a tip or an interested business to host one our machines. We will actually be at the Chicago Bitcoin conference this July 19th and 20th, hope to see some people there
@_date: 2014-07-27 22:00:13
Yes it is
@_date: 2014-07-28 00:57:49
The cash is put in and comes out of the second slot (near the bottom) on the machine, it is generally straightforward, however with eobanb's experience I will be buying additional labels for the receipt printer as well as the cash input/dispenser.
@_date: 2014-07-28 00:35:47
Soon... :)
@_date: 2014-07-27 23:04:33
Nope! That is a Bitcoin QR reader for scanning your public key.
@_date: 2014-07-28 07:55:46


You're absolutely right about this part. That's why, unlike many localbitcoin merchants, we scan I.D.s for transactions larger than $3000 as required by MSB laws. Along with this we have a corporate litigation lawyer who makes sure we stay in compliance with state and federal regulation.
@_date: 2014-10-20 02:39:45
They accept bitcoin there!
@_date: 2014-07-07 23:22:01
We fulfill all of the regulations of a Money Service Business registered with FINCEN, there is no need to record palm scans for the purpose for AML
