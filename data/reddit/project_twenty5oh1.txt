What does supply and demand have to do with mining rewards when the mining rewards are practically nonexistent?
@_date: 2014-01-25 16:55:08
Don't you understand that the gains of the last five years for btc can also be used for doge? Btc paved the way, they have the same utility, it will all come down to what currency people will want to use, in this regard doge actually has advantages over btc, such as approachability and using whole numbers people find psychologically palatable.

I'm here because of the meta bot, and because I was arguing with the OP in another thread in and followed his profile to this extremely mature post they made.
The post that points here in was downvoted. People called that censorship. It's not. What else to explain?
@_date: 2014-01-26 01:36:37
what he's saying is it's unprecedented in modern history to use .0000n of  something to buy a pack of smokes and a soda at the corner store. whole numbers, like dollars, and larger numbers, like pesos or yen, would seem to be easier to grasp and more attractive psychologically.

You're post title says "the community", which actually is one guy with a negative score. If you stand in opposition to something, at least use honest arguments.
@_date: 2014-05-09 19:33:54
ugh... i meant block 6929999. not 3929999... 
no dude, I get it, "so you're saying I can dodge bullets" "no neo, when you're ready you won't have to" i get it. Even so, we need to be able to make a comparison to the monetary value in terms of buying power.
@_date: 2014-01-25 16:13:38
i think that's a rather neutered analogy, dolls:babies is not a fair comparison to doge:btc - doge can be used the exact same way as btc and shares most all qualities of btc except for the customized distinctions like total coins, mining algo, etc.

Meh, pronunciation is still a topic of debate inside the doge community, so that's not really much of an indicator.
@_date: 2014-01-25 16:52:06
Again, the pet rock is a bad analogy - by their very nature, bitcoin and dogecoin have the same utility, a pet rock and a pet dog do not have the same utility.
@_date: 2014-01-25 16:32:32
You are claiming things achieved in the last two weeks, completely external to bitcoin, as differences between the coins?
That's rather silly, don't you think? It's not some asexual doll, i can very easily exchange my doge for btc and use those services.
What would you say if tomorrow doge was accepted at starbucks?
Those are not examples of something intrinsic to the currency, it's still a not very applicable analogy. Overstock and TD probably don't even know what doge is.

I'd actually agree with you on the second point, but not the first. Scrypt aciss are coming fast and furious and are constantly sold out, so yeah, there is definitely a market for them.
@_date: 2014-01-25 15:56:39
wouldn't the shortest path to crypto success be widespread adoption of the very idea of crypto? People i've explained bitcoin to in the past whose eyes glaze over are suddenly interested in doge, and not just interested, downloaded the qt client, involved in the community and starting to mine.
@_date: 2014-05-09 17:52:56
So 21mm coins isn't a hard cap?

No, not by that logic. You're an ass, and if you don't want to have an honest argument, you can fuck right off.
@_date: 2014-05-09 19:20:05
Sorry, yes I am listening, we have been having two different conversations... As I replied to someone else:
Okay, here's why it doesn't make sense to me why adding decimal places matters.
The block rewards at block 3929999 is 1 satoshi. Say each BTC is worth 1 million dollars. That means each block reward is 1 cent. 1 red cent. Wow, such mining reward, very profit. It's clear at that point that the transaction fees will be the only reason to mine.
Tell me why again adding decimal places matter at all? Are we arguing about the difference between a null reward and an infinitesimal one?

FTFY. Doge is like 8 weeks old man, it's no surprise it's not immediately accepted.
And the utility I refer to comes from the protocol, not where it is accepted. They both have the same utility in terms of *what they intrinsically  are*. Acceptance comes with time, as you have argued the last 5 years BTC has fought for such acceptance.
@_date: 2014-01-26 01:41:23
that's fine to say, but that's an added step in mental calculation for someone who doesn't understand what a satoshi is and how to quickly discern the value of something in reference to a whole unit.
@_date: 2014-01-26 01:34:04
i haven't seen many instances of trolling outside of threads discussing doge, wouldn't any doge related comments then be relevant and not trolling?
@_date: 2014-05-09 23:38:55
If you read the thread you'd understand we were talking about how miners get paid. Bitcoin can be mined out, unless they add decimal places, but all that does is prolong rewards at negligible values. My point was still valid, which was that most value will come from tx fees, whereas doge will continue to pay miners bigger rewards in perpetuity. Also you're a chump
@_date: 2014-01-26 03:28:13
did you read what I wrote? Also that was my first post, I was just trying to explain the OP's meaning. I said I'd say "six bucks" because that conveys value, if I said 5.79 someone would say "so, six bucks".
@_date: 2014-05-07 20:44:00
Hey OP, i'm not sure that your post title is accurate since you've been on the front page of for the better part of a day. Seems like you had an overall fine response.

Approachability and using whole numbers are intrinsic to dogecoin, not external - it's called *dogecoin*, and there are 100b coins to be mined total, not 21m. These are internal differences. External differences would be where they are accepted.
I never blasted you, i just disagreed...

for nearly two weeks, 25 miners occupied more than half the hashrate on the largest ltc pool, which had been dangerously close to 50% of the total ltc hashrate.

this is a pedantic argument, the point is humans are used to greying over the part of the number east of the decimal point.
I went to the store and bought candy and drinks for $5.79 - if anyone asked how much it cost, i'll say "six bucks".

Down voting =/= censorship. Its not like the post was removed.
@_date: 2014-05-09 18:42:36
Thanks! It was a shitty explanation.
Here's what he MEANT to say:
"Miners are rewarded with transaction fees." I knew the answer already, I didn't understand what the hell he was talking about.
@_date: 2014-05-09 18:27:49
No, I don't think you did. Once all 21mm coins are mined, what are miners rewarded with?
@_date: 2014-05-09 19:00:41
What does expanding beyond 8 decimal places have to do with block rewards?
@_date: 2014-05-09 18:43:26
... I didn't upvote or downvote a post, but are you saying that a community which curates its own content is censorship? Why are you even on reddit, then?
@_date: 2014-05-09 18:45:56


What the actual fuck are you talking about?
Check out block 6930000 - what's the reward? Zero. Mining will only be paid for by *transaction fees*. Why am I explaining this?
@_date: 2014-06-02 00:44:29
Except Scrypt. Which, granted, isn't as big as the SHA market, but it's growing.
@_date: 2014-01-26 19:59:41
quit acting dense, the point was the humans are psychologically built to process whole numbers, hence saying "six bucks" instead of 5.79, that's all.
@_date: 2014-05-09 18:25:46
So... I'm wrong? Elaborate.

A community downvoting content it doesn't want *in it's own subreddit* isn't censorship... it's curating the content of the subreddit. That's how reddit works. It's not a "brigade"...
a brigade is one subreddit going to another subreddit to downvote/upvote content that wouldn't normally be upvoted/downvoted by their own internal community. This is basic reddit.
