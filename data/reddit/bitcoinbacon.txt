You forget about self interest. Even if the USA made it illegal, they couldn't enforce a worldwide ban. Other jurisdictions would continue using it openly and they couldn't stop it from operating under the table within a jurisdiction even if they wanted to. As it continues to be used its effect on the global card game of fiat will continue to increase until either Bitcoin breaks under its own weight, or it breaks all of them one at a time domino style.

This is an anti-fragile technology. Like torrents. Any obstructions will be routed around eventually. It may take longer than some people think but it will eventually change more than anyone can imagine.

You mean that alliance that is already deteriorating ahead of schedule? They just kicked the Greeks out lol the EU doesn't even cover all of Europe. 


Speak for yourself. And again, they can't enforce a global ban. No one can not even the UN. 
If it can't be shut down, it can't be destroyed then self interest will drive it forward like every great advancement in human history. Common self interest will make the bitcoiners a group not to mess with.

Fair point. With a trillion dollar black hole budget they could do a lot but I still don't see how they could break Bitcoin without first getting on the inside and once they are in it is more beneficial for them to use it against other nations than to try and take it down. Trying to take it down would be an attempt that is not garenteed to work, and if it warrants this much attention they obviously know it can be used as a financial weapon and we all know how much they love getting new toys to fuck over other countires.

I am fairly confident bitcoin operates as the most free market that exists besides the black markets. My understanding of free markets is that any and all manipulation becomes exponentially less effective and more expensive the longer it is carried on. Therfore any obstruction, such as censorship will be routed around. There is plenty of evidence to show that this is happening, it may not be as fast as most people are used to seeing because decentralized decisions generally take longer than centralized mandated changes from an authority but I believe it is happening right on schedule. More subreddits, new forums, different media outlets are all popping up all over the place. I see no evidence that the censorship has stopped progress whatsoever. If anything it is helping speed it up.

so much this.if bitcoin becomes a credible threat then buy into it because no amount of force is going to guarantee a win against the Bitcoin network. If it could, the music and movie industries would of taken down torrents.

I will definitely need to do more reading on the studies around these arguments. 
However, my understanding of basic economics and game theory suggests that if and when centralization of nodes becomes a substantially larger threat to the system, miners would have to take on the cost of the node as an insurance policy to make sure that this threat is minimized. Most node operators today see it as a sunk cost against network failure and I doubt that will change even though the cost of a node may continue to rise. Each side seems to blow this out of proportion and claim the worst of the other, it is almost as bad as watching american politics but I think we will meet somewhere in the middle eventually.
The middle ground is where all the money is after all and that is what most if not all of us really want. Bitcoin can not stand on its own as just a store of value. It also can't stand on its own as just a payment network. It would be too easy to replace and replicate if we limit it to just one base use case. For it to continue disrupting most of the financial world today it needs to continue to be both.

Prove I use bitcoin. Oh you cant. Kinda hard to throw me in jail then. 
You can't argue multiple points I have brought up the biggest being this is an antifragile technology. Bitcoin doesn't need the majority to win. Sure it would be nice but it works just fine with the current user base. Again, it can't be shut down, it can't be stopped.

Not all countries have the same monetary or economic policies. Most of them vary greatly. Its ignorant to assume one country or even a group  of them could pressure every other as this hasn't happened ever I don't see it happening soon. Also back to anti fragile tech routing around any and all obstacles. Just like the music industry lobbied to kill torrenting, didn't really work did it? 
The simple way of putting it is these countries running on fiat are running on pure faith. Faith isn't constant, and it can be degraded or lost completely. Bitcoin runs on mathematics and despite whatever the authoritarians claim or promise, they can't shut it down.

person to person, just like when I needed to buy alcohol before I turned 21 or when I wanted marijuana before it became medical. Prohibition doesn't work.


again it doesn't need to be used by everyone to get big enough to destabilize fiat. Fiat is unstable by itself on a long enough timeline, Bitcoin providing excellent completion will just accelerate the trend to 0. 
Sure they could stop legal businesses from using it above table but not under the table and that's what scares them.

Certain people who built really cool tools for Bitcoin wanted to force users to use them by creating an artificial scarcity in block size. 
Bitcoin is like a road, the block size is the width of the road. The larger it is the more cars can fit at the same time. People built highways for when we run out of room on the road. They have argued we should keep the road the same size and use the cool new highways more. Everyone else decided to make the road larger like we always planned to do. The end.

The concentrated wealth of bankers is the end game for a system designed as sound money. The Bitcoin system needs a little over $1 million a day in new money to meet the current 10% inflation. Half a room full of bankers could buy that up pretty fast.

The problem here is that you assume governments faced with certain death would band together. Nothing on this green earth could get all the governments to ban together. Anyway, even if they all formed a world government to counter this Bitcoin thing, there is still no certainty that they could stop it. They tried and failed to stop torrenting. This would be no different.

Why is bitcoin going to be world reserve currency? 
Market manipulation gets exponentially less effective the more it is used.
Ask yourself, if the central banks could fix all the problems of the world by printing more money then why are they now asking to print more money AND charge negative interest rates? 
Central planners have been manipulating the markets, ignoring the time tested market law that manipulation becomes more expensive and less effective over time. 
Bitcoin's price can be manipulated, but it gets more expensive and less effective the more you do it. So who cares if they are or are not? This is the free market and it will work itself out in the end.

I would say Bitcoin has not experienced a crash. I understand its being used to describe a bubble burst but a crash should really be reserved for when trades are halted. Bitcoins have never stopped trading to my knowledge.
