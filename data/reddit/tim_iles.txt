Wow that would be amazing! Get in touch if you need anything, info on contacts page :-)

Eventually I'd love to support all the popular cryptos, yeah! But I'd have to consider the needs of each currency differently - what's important for BTC might not be a high priority for doge, etc...
tl;dr: yes!

Would you be interested in getting an alert when the coins move? I'm trying out a few wallet-related startup ideas, and this weekend I put live WalletHQ.com, so far the only feature I've completed is address tracking. I'd love to find out if this is something people would find useful!

Wow, thanks! I'll listen to the show tonight. Will tweet about it too, once today's tx malleability issues are ironed out... Cheers!

I currently have the same problem - although my withdrawal status says "Waiting to be processed", and I can hit Cancel. Are you unable to Cancel yours?

Try alt+F4?

Are you sure Google charges them every click from the same IP? I'd be surprised if they do..?

Thanks. I probably should have phrased the title differently to ask how counterfeiting supposedly being an important aspect of UK economy would be different with a non-counterfeitable currency... Too late to change title, oh well.

Facebook must have thought it was worth $3bn to prevent Snapchat competing - doesn't necessarily mean Snapchat would be worth that much to anybody else though.
Also it's possible Snapchat rejected the bid because they knew they wouldn't stand up to a security audit etc?

Sorry for your loss. FWIW, I've set up an alert on my website (wallethq.com), so I'll get notified as soon as your coins move on from this address. I don't know what good it will do, unless the owner is a noob and exposes his/her identity further down the chain. But if anyone has an idea for more things walletHQ could do to try to help, I'll do my best to implement it!
edit: if it was this StealthBit thing, at least thomasrevor has now been removed from Github.

Good question - you can choose between inputs/outputs/both. So in the case of the FBI addresses, you can track outputs only. 
I'll have to check out your show! 
@_date: 2014-02-05 15:29:35
I'm currently working on this: wallethq.com. It's like v0.1 so far, but it might do what you want already? Feedback would be great!

Same problem silk road 2 supposedly had, I think everyone's forgotten about them already though.

I thought it'd be interesting in the context of how Bitcoin cannot be counterfeited.

Tippercoin is entirely on-blockchain too - is ChangeTip? (Haven't tried it out yet)

Not if he just replenished his bitcoin supply with however much the pizza would have cost in dollars.

Hey, I made this a few weeks ago, got a lot more features I want to create but it does paper wallet alerts so far:

Good spot! Related:

I had set up an alert using a tool I built a year ago ( - forgot it was still running to be honest!  The email popped while the transaction was still on 1 confirmation.
Edit: I misunderstood your question, yeah it'll be harder to know when it goes through an exchange, don't know...
