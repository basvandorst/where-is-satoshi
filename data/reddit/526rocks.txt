What does it offer as a crypto? I would assume they all have similar goals - a fast and cheap P2P payment system to circumvent traditional banking. What other goals would they have?

People here will tell you to use Litecoin because Bitcoin is a "store of value" 
I'll get banned for saying this but just use Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, or some other coin until Bitcoin actually becomes usable...
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:43:24
Except it's basically useless as a currency at the moment...

I'm not calling it a hard crash until it drops more than $4000
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:19:03
Who is it for besides investors?
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:34:33
I'll take one
Wouldn't want you getting caught with that
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:46:34
Are you referring to a 51% attack?
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:45:50
The point is the fees make the tip useless
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:02:33
But what is the point of a crypto that doesn't work onchain? Bitcoin used to be that, and it was great. That was the reason it was able to get from an idea to $8k per coin.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:59:39
As if you could tip with Bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:01:17
A corporate altcoin...
That's ironic. Have you seen Bitcoin lately?
I don't care which coin you support but the misinformation being spread here is crazy. Go do your own research, outside of r/bitcoin. That's why I'm here. I don't agree with most of it, but I'm looking to balance my biases. Go through my history if you like, I hate to be rude like that, but the misinformation here is getting out of hand and I needed to rant.

Stop acting retarded, this isn't that complicated.... every other wallet defaults Bitcoin and you don't see Bitcoin Cash supporters bitching about it. Everyone says Bcash then flips shit when Bitcoin Cash supporters say Bitcoin Core.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:03:19
Please. It's becoming a name smearing campaign and it's ridiculous
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:49:52
Thank you, that explained it very well!
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:58:26
That wasn't directed at OP, the Interface is perfectly fine, anybody could understand it. He's clearly exaggerating it because he is against Bitcoin Cash, which is fine, but no need to bash the app for that. Download it yourself and tell me it isn't extremely obvious. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:08:47
Litecoin is fine, it's all preference as far as I know. Bitcoin Cash just seems to be growing quickly.
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:19:48
Do you have any links explaining the lightning network or can you sum up the road map? Thanks
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:23:04
Thank you, but I'm aware, I'm not completely new to this.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:52:24
Call me a heretic but Bitcoin Cash seems to be succeeding with big blocks. As storage technology improves, the benefits of a large blocks definitely are looking like they outweigh the drawbacks. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:48:00
Or it's to talk about altcoins (mostly Bitcoin Cash) because they aren't happy with the current scaling plan...
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:59:15
That is the only altcoin they suggest to use. Mentioning anything else in this sub will get you banned (especially Bitcoin Cash)
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:55:05
So what is Core's proposed solution?
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:32:19
Or use PayPal and pay $10.50 instead of $20 for a $10 donation

CEO of Bitcoin.com is what I think you're referring to.
@_date: 2018-04-25 16:34:12
Who said Roger Ver is the CEO of a coin?
