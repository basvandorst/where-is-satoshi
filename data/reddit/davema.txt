Theoretical probability : 0.416034049679
Simulated probability : 0.416037763958
The comments explain whats going on pretty well, just wondering where the values for alpha and gamma come from?
Edit: heres the full paper:  (section 4.4 deals with these values)

Yeah, its a great paper. It all comes down to how quickly they can propogate their blocks over the honest blocks - at gamma=0.5, they are making increased revenue above 25%. If they can imporve their propogation (for example by the use of a sybil attack), they can be profitable all the way down to 15% or less. Also, dont forget that they lose nothing by selfish-mining, at worst they get the same rewards as an honest pool.

OK, But I was more interested in what alpha and gamma denote. 
Anyways, I got it from reading the paper - Alpha is a measure of the percentage of the overall computing power the selfish pool has (so alpha = 0.35 is modelling a pool with 35% of the global hashrate). Gamma is a measure of how likely miners will choose to work on the selfish-miners published branch, in the event that two blocks are published at the same time - so its a measure of how quickly the selfish miners can propogate their block to the network when they choose to do so (with 1 meaning their branch is chosen 100% of the time, and 0 meaning the honest branch is always chosen - 0.5 means that their brach is picked 50% of the time)
Note that alpha only makes sense between 0 an 0.5, since once you have &gt; 0.5, you have majority control of the network. Also, the paper concludes that even if they modify the protocol as described, their is still a hard theoretical limit of 33% of the global hashrate, above which any pool could execute a selfish-mine attack with success.
Very interesting reading, thanks for sharing!
