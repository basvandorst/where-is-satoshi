Because others use it too, you shouldnt. So remember, dont invest in Tesla - Nissan has an electric car too.
You reasoning isnt sound. Lightning solves a lot of the issues that would be holding bitcoin back, its also considered another layer to the blockchain. 
Youre treating like its bluetooth for phones. Its not exactly optional at this point; you need it.
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:45:38
This is correct.
@_date: 2018-01-25 13:03:22
The report order page looks scammy as fuck. I doubt much weight will go into this.
@_date: 2018-01-26 03:16:33
Although i think we are getting closer to moving away from speculation, i have to agree with you here.
@_date: 2018-01-21 17:23:22
Hes basing this on a chart that averaged closing prices of bitcoin on each weekday. Sunday historically closes lower. (Cant find chart atm)
@_date: 2018-01-30 12:05:46
I fully agree and I think we will see that future sooner than later. I was just curious if others might have seen some innovation in this area yet. Kind of telling how infant it is if not.
@_date: 2018-01-26 13:18:09
Not at all. I have a thousand rebuttals to this but im more curious how you reached your conclusion?
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:46:08
Not to be rude but have you even been involved in the space the last couple years?
How can the bubble be over when it seems to be just begining (in my eyes)? Do bubbles usually only involve the early adopters and end before mass adoption? Isnt mass adoption the bubble pop?
To me, it seems like the interest is at an ATH but the use is only starting to match that interest. Id say in my personal life, co-workers, family, friends, 4/5 think its a great idea and not a scam anymore. 1/10 might own some.
EDIT - i need sleep
@_date: 2018-01-30 02:10:08
I think this be over complicating it as some direction, even creating an address is required.
I agree though that when you say, "bob give me your wallet address!" "Yes, ALL the numbers and letters" "its called gas bob just pay the fee"
But how do you simplify these things? For anything this is a hurdle but we need someway to demystify this a bit to allow wider adoption and easy use.
Edit - id like to say are coming up with fixes. Like dns names for wallets etc. But i think its a hurdle not getting much attention yet.
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:55:34
Except they never returned to "normal". How exactly are you gauging its fundamental value to know when the bubble has popped? 
@_date: 2018-01-20 18:05:44
Are you unaware of the solutions that are in development to fix the fee and speed issues? Are you also not recognizing that people use bitcoin and those that do could take advantage of lower fees that relative to bitcoin and its congestion is "fast"? 
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:47:55
Thank you!
I was so tired of trying to correct bad info jesus christ... scam city...
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:28:27
I like this pattern but a net of 90x up doesnt sound like a bubble pop to me. 100x up and 80x down, thats a problem.
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:49:13
The ads so obviously scams that even facebook could see it.
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:52:16
Enthusiasts? You think this is a Hobby Lobby special? Isnt useful? You understand the problems it solves? 
Your agenda is pretty clear, maybe you can start elaborating on your opinions because they sound like book cover titles or parroting something you heard and clearly dont understand.
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:34:41
Why even say that? If you think its over then move on. Why are you in the bitcoin sub? Its new tech, its getting mainstream attention, and, if you actually believe in it like OP youd be able to see its potential future looks awesome. Why is his conclusion, especially given the historical data, "following the herd"?
It seems like the obvious choice given the data.
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:46:31
It was too broad and caused usage like this.

@_date: 2019-07-16 12:43:51
And this is where the community loses it. 


Yeah good thing to brag about for your internet points because you are supporting bitcoin! Dude is a traitor to america and its interests, i find it very telling about who is running this sub with the upvoted comments I see.
I guess it is in russias interest to see bitcoin succeed, especially against the dollar.
Here i thought it was about the tech, some of you are sick fucks.

No malware will not do this. You did this by leaving your bitcoin laying on the sidewalk and then screamed thief when someone picked it up.
Your scenario is stupid and youd deserve it.

My concern is the quick consolidation and massive buy backs the breaks caused. The added strain to the lower middle class isnt helping and i think this is the catalyst for 2019. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 19:52:04
I cant speak to rootstock specifically but this is actually where i see specialized utility tokens thriving and having a model like this. Might take a while but the alts i see surviving are the high utility ones that fan interface with bitcoin in other layers.
@_date: 2018-09-09 17:59:20
I was more or less patting your shoulder. Sometimes, you just need to tell them off. :)
@_date: 2018-09-09 15:02:14
The items you listed in your post are reasons to celebrate and relate directly to adoption. 
Anonymity is getting boosted with mast, taproot etc.
Lightning network is new, we havent even see the atomic swaps.
Moon memes follow price, youre just wrong there.
So yeah. From your own perspective, youre the asshole at the ice cream party yelling at everyone over frozen spilt milk.
Good job, homophobe.

Can you provide the sources?
@_date: 2018-09-09 17:58:33
Because you didnt ask that question. 
You wanted to know how to deliver $5,000 USD in pennies. Not $1.25. Your question now becomes valid.
@_date: 2018-09-10 02:08:26
Id try for the coins. If denied the coins i dont see why you cant ask for money.
I say coins because you can collect on all the forks since then too.
@_date: 2018-09-23 18:56:32
Sure but that wasnt the point i was trying to make.
@_date: 2018-09-09 18:00:20
Your company, if using crypto, would in fact batch them. As everyone else. Id imagine if adoption got to that level, mortgages would be a layer 2/3 item since more control will be had that way.
@_date: 2018-09-02 12:16:14
This is where i see most alts going via strong utility and additional layers. this is almost possible now with lightning expanding and atomic swaps.

Why are you in bitcoin? Traditional stocks are doing great right now so a few months ago would have been a good time to get in. So why did you choose bitcoin?
Any answer you supply beyond making money will be the reason your post doesnt matter.

This is what keeps me bullish on alts. They are like the tinkerers in the garage. The big boys will either accept their innovations and absorb them or they will ignore something huge. Monero i think is getting that treatment.
You say "soon" but the speed at which bitcoin moves is ungodly slow, even when the change has no negative and all positive. Looking at you segwit. 
@_date: 2018-09-26 15:08:28

@_date: 2018-09-04 00:28:27
Whats that? Bitcoin processes more transaction? More than double of bitcoin cash?! How is this possible with such tiny block!?! ROGERRRR
@_date: 2018-09-03 01:19:43
Personally think 6100 will happen in september and the launch.
The amount of btc to that needs to be sold to reach 10k keeps climbing yet the price is increasing. this is telling me bears are weakening but imo they have one last stand in them before we bull the fuck out. October 22nd.

Too long. If the US suddenly got interested all they can do is mine or buy. There is no vast reserve to pull from the majority of coins are mined already too. I just cant see 5 years. Being realistic given the stage were at.
Consider a lot of the rich here got there 50+ bitcoins prior to the 3k+ price range. we havent seen a large pool of millionaire/billionaire/investing firms begin to enter until now.

@_date: 2018-09-17 15:47:32
A scam coin that tries to play the role as the source of everything. Before Bitcoin Cash was a fork or even mine-able it was dubbed bcash. It was dubbed that because like other forks, its an alt of bitcoin. We dont call Bitcoin Gold Bitcoin, we call it BGold for the same reason its BCash.
BCashers like to say that BCash is a mining software. Well, i named my dick Milk, doesnt mean I am right. BCash the mining client CAME AFTER the terminology. Dont let people fool you. Google is your friend on that, the time stamps dont lie.
And finally, the community and market decided. Bitcoin is Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash is the alt, bcash.

Its your lack of details in the evaluation. You're only pushing the parts of the opinion that prop up the position your taking on this. Im not saying you dont have valid points and you probably didnt try to have an "agenda" but the way you presented your information just makes it seem so. Wasnt trying to make it sound I was discounting what you wrote. Again, I appreciate seeing that kinda commentary here. We need criticism.
As a note, I also think the guy replying to you might be a bit crass.

Not true. When the builders constructing the other huge cities jump over and then utilize faster tools, 400% happened.
Your size is also relative, not just the hashrate.


I think your analysis is incomplete. You keep saying whoever, someone etc. Samsung and other major players are entering the mining market. This growth isnt surprising me personally. Going back to your 400% example.

lol no, coinbase gives me free Hulu, Netflix, theatre tickets (sometimes) and returns my purchase fees. ONLY if I use bitcoin though, not for ETH or LTC. So Bitcoin is actually better. During the fork, Bitcoin also added extra rewards for finding new blocks not limited to the rewards I listed above and some includes a lambo. Interesting stuff, doesnt sound like you know much about crypto.

If it is still multi-trillion then your entire argument falls apart and you wont be disrupting it. IE - no miners left, no idle power. 


Full nodes. Consensus rules. 
Because of the special assumptions and conditions you are giving your example, I propose that lightweight nodes become full consensus nodes are powered by solar power and low orbit free internet. You literally cant attack now.

What I currently do is use the Square Cash App - no fee buy in whereas coinbase will charge you 1-3 dollars. I can also instantly add money at the same time as buying the bitcoin so I dont need to leave idle money in their app.

Too vague to cover every scenario but this is not always true. Some scams cant and wont be reversed. That is not a benefit over crypto. Its also not foreign to crypto, governance chains exist. REQUEST network functions.


This is not always true. If Timmy doesnt like your credit or cheque systems score, you WILL pay a service charge. In 3rd world countries this is also not uncommon regardless of standing or status.
LEND and other similar coins exist to loan as well, also not a perk.
Bitcoin hasnt charged me to store my money either.

I remember when the train first came around. The advances to get there was incredible. I knew it was going to be something so I took a couple rides. They didnt cost much and some i was able to exchange for working around what would become todays "train stations". 
Eventually the train became something and as I told stories about it years on, one individual who had watched the train station get built from across the street, was angry at my stories because i was simply there and only road the train for fun. He went on to say that I was just riding it to milk its potential popularity like a new series of baseball cards. The modern cereal box toy collection called "the train". He also reminded me that I didnt build it or contribute to its creation. 
But you know what? I was one of the first riders. For some reason this guy couldnt comprehend that I risked my life, time and money just to be on that train. Somehow, I was disgraceful, not the guy calling trains "cereal box toy collectables".

Credit unions do not shield you from all of this.
If someone ACHes your account and the money isnt there, they not only wont pay it, you get a fee. Sure, these can be refunded sometimes but this is never a scenario with crypto.
I cannot pull out more than $500 without upping this limit except at midnight when the service is unavailable due to banking accounting stuff. 
If i want to deposit more than $1500 i have to tell them why.
Sure, you dont get charged to have an account but it certainly doesnt protect from its antiquated systems or the governance requiring you to explain some of your actions with YOUR money.

I think terrorists love Fiat more


Know what youre talking about before you speak.
Banks can refuse to return money due to fraud
Banks not helping fraud victims
FDIC does not insure your money due to scam, theft or robbery


Do you also use sticks to make fire? Request Network is what you would use to make purchases from ebay etc not Bitcoin. Youd also just atomic swap via Lightning Network to Request. Google it, I dont care to explain.


If you have a wad of cash on you and go mountain climbing and it falls out of your pocket, im sorry you did that. However, logical individuals do not do this with their bitcoin private keys. Youre trying to apply a banking concept to bitcoin private keys, not how it works dumb dumb.
If malware steals your banking creds, you might not get that money back either. See my above posts. Google some more if youre interested. Im glad your bank is amazing, but we arent talking about you.


No its not. See above. youre lying.


No they shouldnt. They should a variety of crypto or what for the additional layers. Stop talking like bitcoin is a finished product, I am starting to wonder if you even know how bitcoin works.

Actually you get 2 and that was not my point at all. Give me your banking details, i'll go ahead and ACH your account 20 times for 10k each time. You WILL incur a fee for this. That is my point.

Dont make plans with it. None of this "this is totally going to 20k and im getting a car!". Plan for the car separate to bitcoin. The volatility is just too drastic to make plans like a traditional investment.
Personally, I enjoy price watching because its fun to make empty bets to myself. I dont care about the money I got in but thats because I dont have hundreds of thousands in either. The coolest idea I saw was someone saying looking at their spending and skipping snack foods, gas station stops etc. But instead of "skipping over" them, he would buy bitcoin via mobile app. Mm... snickers and chips... nope $5 to bitcoin instead!

I never really considered this but these old dudes nailed one of the biggest use case for the smart contracts. They could understand that because they have to be actively involved with the process in their current investment streams.
They dont use money. They will never understand P2P cash. Settlement layer and decentralized, self-banking? They literally never had a need or probably even go into banks anymore beyond signing contracts.
These arent individuals. They are individuals representation organizations. It makes a ton of sense and they are going to miss out. I love it.

I dont think this space actually has room for orthodox followers. It is pretty clear by making this open source and allowing outsiders to add to the project that the vision was one with growth in mind.
Lets take the basis of this entire article for a second - at its core it is trying to wrap its argument around this quote from Satoshi in the whitepaper:


Coinbase is counter to this. Bisq is not. I see no reason you cant have both.
Lets move on to the starting complaint though:


Think about this for a moment. Lets say for a moment that the speculative nature of the coin was gone and no one was concerned about what that meant or where its price was going. How then, would I know that my car, is worth the amount of coins youre giving me? If I cannot speculate on the value of the coins, how do I know the compared value to my car? At some point you must speculate. 21 million coins. That is it. I am speculating that because some wider adoption has hit my city, they are probably more rare, thus I am willing to accept less coins for my car.
As someone who isnt in the business of cars, I might also trade something I can get cheaper than average, sell it for bitcoin and hold onto them as others around me increase its value.
The type of pricing or usage of bitcoin youre describing comes AFTER mass adoption. When 1 BTC = 1 BTC. You simply cannot discount the growth that will occur along the way, how it will get there, and the obvious the speculative ride that will come. There is only 21 million coins after all.


If youre trying to tell me that people speculating on the price is what caused the general public to not use it, youre reaching so far its not worth commenting on this.


And here we go, now we reach the hidden agenda. Youre shortsighted, and thats OK. The way you act so confident about it, not so much.
What and where can I spend my bitcoin right now? Who is front running that? Why is Libra coming into existence if bitcoin already has this widespread capability? Simply because Bitcoin is not ready yet. In order to have a nascar vehicle, you need to learn how to make the wheel spins. This is what value is to bitcoin. The rest of the car is things like exchanges, commerce, wallet technology. Because the coin had to prove its ability at finance, the obvious first step is financial ones. How you cannot see this is more intentional than a misunderstanding I think.
So while you complain about people testing, stressing, moving hundreds of millions  for 32cents, wallet technology just isnt there yet. Our biggest leaps for the public is Coinbase (damnit), BTCPay, Bakkt, Samsung (phones with native wallets) and these things are yet to come. For hating on those that pay attention to the price, this article does a lot of that.


It is OK to stack your bitcoins. I love the problem laid bare but no solution even suggested. So lets store our value in gold or fiat and then just convert it and spend it via bitcoin then convert it back again? Sounds retarded.


jesus fucking christ...


Bitcoin accomplishes both things. Bitcoin can be a bank, freeing you from financial institutions, and also peer-to-peer cash, freeing you from them again. Bitcoin is all of this and then some. Do you even use fucking bitcoin?






The hurdle to using bitcoin isnt because people are holding it. Its because the entry in and out is not simple yet. Its available at a lot of retailers, I dont see anyone making videos about that. Because even for us lurkers, hodlers, whoever you want to bash to being unbanked, its still too tedious. It will get there, but holy shit guy, do some research before you write.
You finished your entire article by saying that hodlers should spend and flood the market with bitcoins. This article is about as juicy, lost, emotionally stale and complex at the same time, the author MUST be 16-19.

You would probably be shocked by the amount of people who swear they hate ipv6 and prefer ipv4 without realizing their ISP is tunneling / using an IPv6 gateway.
The majority of people in IT are lazy about implementing IPv6 (lightning network if it had waited 10 years to release as OP said) even though we are running out of IPv4 addresses (full blocks).
Now we implemented some tricks to split the amount of needed IPv4 space so we effectively stopped the doomsday event but that will only do so much (segwit).

Nopers, I think immediate on-chain will have its place. I think however there is no point making retail transactions on-chain versus off-chain and then letting them settle on-chain. Rules will be rules. 


Like any tech, it dies hard. IPv4 will still certainly have its place. Its "easier" to understand that ipv6 so there is going to be a hybrid period. Eventually I expect something to integrate and replace ipv6 or something "ipv6b" that will overcome that challenge.

You are correct - I guess what I was trying to say is that I dont think Bakkt would receive it on a unique address for each payment. These payments would probably just end up at the same address, sort of used as a DMZ and then sent to other wallets upon a threshold, trigger etc.

My apologies, can you elaborate on what you mean when you said "Until crypto offers a way to only let those trading hold coins and mine"? This sounds like you are saying that only those actively using (trading) the coin hold and mine it. I want to be sure before I respond.


Lets use your own example. Just because YOU trust user 4, 8 and 10 doesnt mean they do. Infact, they dislike user 4 because of a politically motivated interest. So they wont be confirming with user 4, what are you gonna do about it?
To expand on that, they will tell YOU who to trust, when the option to manual select is available. In fact, they will likely join a consortum of retailers that use the trusted group of processors. They might even call it SWIFT.
In the spirit of brainstorming, what if you didnt choice who those people were and in fact, they were completely random and never knew about eachother? What if we called it the Lightning Network?


This is redundant.

Yeah my understanding is that a loss is not a taxable event (return, write off or otherwise) so you dont have to report it. I was told this by tax person doing crypto stuff. That doesnt give it credibility but I'd like to think he was able to do better homework than I. 
Regardless, as you said, keep your damn records in order. Even if the market is down and they want you to prove you had a loss atleast you can. But I'm not reporting until I need to because its none of their damn business what I am doing with my money.
I look at the whole "privacy will make money laundering easy peasy!" as the easy way out. If your kids friend is coming over being an asshole you could simply just not let him come over anymore. Problem solved. Or I could set some traps and trick him into doing something so I can get him red handed.

But in this case I think youre assuming information. The insurance would not help this couple, looking at the details of the case the Bank and courts declared the transaction complete. There would be no insurance claim to file.
The important parts:
The wife gives her cards to her husband. The ATM does not dispense cash and claims it did. Claim opened with SBI and they said sorry you shared your card and PIN, this is your fault.


The wife had just given birth so she had no choice but to do so. She was informed that since it was an ATM flaw she would be given her money back anyway.


The money never came and the couple decided to get CCTV footage showing the husband did not receive the cash. They got the footage.


They also obtained a record showing that 3 days later, the ATM was reporting an excess of money in the exact amount they tried to remove and was stuck.


After a long court battle, the bank was citing a violation of PIN Sharing as a justification for why the ATM ate / kept the money.




To summarize, the Bank is saying that the card holder (the wife) should not have given her card to her husband to remove cash. Because of this, the ATM flaw is OK because he should not have been taking the money anyway so they wont be reimbursing her and do not have to.
The core issue because she shared her card. To access her money. They said no and kept it. With the court case precedence I dont see insurance covering that and in this case, I can see why people are talking shit.

it costs on average $0.0000000000000000000000000001 penny for a visitor to the site. It costs $1.50 for OP to use that ATM.
Here is the break down:
$$$$$ - Bill
$$$$$ - Bill
$$$$$ - Bill
$$$$$ - Bill
$$$$$ - Bill
$$$$$ - Bill
$$$$$ - Bill
So as you can see, whe you take the total of each bill and divide it by the users accessing it, we find that the ATM is inefficient and requires additional fees to be available to OP. If people like OP would stop using them, im sure they would take them away in place of online app.
God... I hope no one tells you about Bitcoin ATMs... youre gonna be really upset.

This sub did... ��
@_date: 2018-06-29 12:04:37
It is absolutely delusional to think that for christmas shopping. Shoppers want to spend hundreds, channels cant support that right now.
Youre also delusion to think itll take 15-20 years, in my opinion (not an insult!). Nothing to do with bitcoin and lightning but technology moves quick in todays world and roll outs sometimes take a simple software update now (looking at PoS systems for instance).

Not how off chain works. Did you google fiat or did you look for crypto offchain? Sounds like fiat.

@_date: 2018-06-11 19:31:03
Hes saying he doesnt agree that futures has anything to do with the price so he cant answer it because he doesnt think the question is valid.
@_date: 2018-06-22 17:22:40
Wait... So they simply returned the value of the bitcoin at the time of the theft? 
IE - you put in .5BTC at $25 bucks (making shit up) when the hack occurred.
Today, they gave you the $25 back?? Id sue again.

Wrong. Bitcoin Banknotes. Or OffCoin off-chain solutions. So bitcoin does have a working solution offline, although it needs work.
@_date: 2018-06-26 17:56:04


For newcomers, maybe. A lot of people already knew the disaster that was going to be.


You have to ignore the fact that there is a limited supply of bitcoin and the price has a very good potential of going up. The incentive to hold bitcoin is because there is a finite supply that wont change. Youd have to be dumb to intentionally ignore and the possibility of it going up.
Its not anywhere until recently was accepting bitcoin. What should I have done, stole shit and left bitcoin? I think theres a point to be made about this.


In theory?  You buy tons of shit with bitcoin, its not a theory. I do agree that large amounts of vendors are accepting yet but only in the last couple months did POS vendors finally announce upgrades to support crypto.


And there it is....


No explanation of this? Nothing in regards to how youre applying this to crypto? Im sure there is some good info in there.


The investor is the problem, not bitcoin.


Overall, I agree with what the article is getting at but I do not agree with their example above. Regulation would be great, but not the kind that shares info simply because you have a large account. There could easily be tools made that wouldnt involve compromising user data without a specific instance of fraud or manipulation. Those tools should also not be governable by 1 nation, government, or otherwise. Certainly is not easy, maybe not even feasible but I refuse to use a system where my account holdings and info are public simply because we are trying to take the easy way out.
This is why im using BISQ now and intend to beef up mining to generate my own coins for "entry" as much as I can.
@_date: 2018-06-26 02:20:52

And a lot of astronauts died getting there. 2nd layer solutions cant be killing astronauts because it wont be 9 of them, itll be 90million.
Technology makes leaps. Figuring out distributed accounting, blockchain transactions, etc, is what bitcoin did for those years. That isnt the same hurdles LN is going to face and I cannot see it taking that long.
Adoption? Thats another story.

Not really. The depth of sales was thinning all last week, was bound to happen. I specifically stated this on 6/27 in a private board. Obviously that doesnt add shit for credibility but i am saying that this didnt even surprise me and was expected.

You sound like a highschool girl bitching about Tina's new pink skirt because she thinks shes sooooo hot.
1. Ethereum has an intended limit ~~a set limit~~ of 100M coins. Will that change? Sure why not but the goal is to limit the coins of which ethereum has not yet crossed any the milestones (one is coming).
2. Go ahead on why you think its a scam, list some reasons beyond the DAO.
3. Finite supply is the not the only room in this space, although ethereum has one so your point is moot. Unless you have a reason on why it has to be 21 million?
EDIT - the limit is intended, as noted by the rest of my post for number 1 but i decided to clarify.

He already sold everything at 6k he said. Hes definitely being hyperbolic, he needs to be at this point as he teeters on uncertainty of buying back in or not before its too late/too early.
@_date: 2019-10-23 12:04:09
They said hes been in there doing it often enough. The mistake he made too is because he didnt RTFM before playing around.
This is like buying a 5k computer rig and plugging the 5v line onto the 4pin USB port on the mobo and frying it. He made a very dumb mistake it says not to do. 
I mean, he basically made himself look like a bad actor to the network. Its fairly easy to follow what he did wrong and I dont use LN yet.

He didnt do a backup restore operation. He dumped the channel state data and then copy pasted his dump. He did not do a restore. 


He didnt actually do a backup/restore. He used an old copy of his LND and breached his own channels.


so did you run the SCB ? how did you run the "backup" ?


via exportchanbackup --all &gt; backup


and exportchanbackup --output_file channel-backup-file


but you said you ran a .lnd backup and force closed all your channels? (edited)


this is very confusing


**yes, using previous files state**. I wonder, am I able to use those static channel backups at the moment? (edited)
and I wont argue with you on this - the developers also agree right now:


EDIT - Downvote all you want. This is stupid simple to understand. Network says do not load up an old client that you think is a backup. It will look like a breach. Instead, do an actual backup and channel state restore. He did not do that. He thought simply backing up the file state (veeam guys, this isnt file level shit, he did a stateful backup), would suffice. He did the commands, sure, but he backed up the actual folder and ran those files. The manual does not say to do this.

Interesting point the article brings up regarding how the prop had to work, including the verifiable end of month bitcoin price.
If tether was propping bitcoin, in order to prop the bank account theyd have to sell their bitcoin. Even if they did this slowly for the last 2 weeks of each month to make that target last day date, it does not correlate to the market price, contrary to what the paper said. Check the early months of 2017, im just not seeing the pattern.

You mean the report from an undergrad student overseen by the professor? The same report a statician disproved it?

Whoever is arguing its not offchain is just wrong. Everyone knows this its silly to even debate. Its also a great solution. For the same reason that you have specific computer parts performing parts of the whole. In the grander scheme of things i think lightning or something like it as a layered solution is going to be closer to the truth and considered core to how bitcoin functions as itll be such a small part of a large ecosystem. Thats my opinion though.
@_date: 2018-06-19 11:24:48

For reasons that arent typical, it does in this circumstance. When demand remands a constant (doesnt need to grow) and supply lowers, it increases the strain on the relationship of supply and demand. So although not traditional, it certainly is the case.

This is interesting. The value of home isnt pegged against the dollar in that people wanting a home provide the value. But the value they derive is based in dollars, thus you arent calculating for it because there is no way to control that. IE - someone might think that 500k home is worth more than I do.

While I enjoy posts like this, i wish they include an afterthough about investing in running a node to help secure the chain. Its part of a problem i see where if mining just isnt zuper worth it, people dont so it (and you shouldnt!) But then it stops there, potentially causing concentration of mining farms, thus centralization. Nodes can help offset that at minimal electricity. You arent making money but then you can still feel like youre "doing your part" beyond hodling.

It is though. We tried at 13k and fell back down. I think we will see 2020 be a slower crawl then predicted which imo lines up perfect with post halvening market movements.

I didnt have time to read it all but you CANT pretend that all miners hashrates are they same. This seems key to your entire example. Know why I cant compete with large mining facilities? Hashrate to difficulty ratio. If the difficulty came down that my little hashrate now gives me more sats, I'd be willing to mine more.
With that said, more miners like me would enter. You're not factoring for what seems like an important detail but I can see how it might be lethal to your narrative so I understand.
People were buying the latest miner at 15k. Ya know what happened to those? Ebay and my rack.
Itll happen again in your example.

Do you know how corporate tax works? Do you know the effects of stock buybacks? Nice skip on the repos too the biggest crutch.

Im not following your math. Gold is valued at 7.7Trillion. BTC was at 10k with a marketcap of about 165B. If BTC was to go up 10x to reach 100k, then its market cap should be around 1.5-2Trillion.
That is not exceeding gold and sounds completely feasible given the last spike from 15B to 330B. Bubble this, bubble, regardless I can see it happening given that information.
So you are speculating that it wont reach 100k right? Because I am speculating it will, just curious if you have anything further to back up that it wont go that high. :)
@_date: 2018-11-13 19:27:00
Ask for their numbers. Then ask for their baseline/control. Then ask how much energy it requires to swipe your credit and process those payments.
Then...ask where the energy is coming from. Youd be surprised to see bitcoin is largely setup in places with easily renewable energy - ie water or wind.
Then ask how many phones they owned in their life. Its easy to see they are causing more home with their phone than bitcoin.
Anyone who isnt hearing it simply isnt listening ie they dont want to hear they are wrong.

Youre assuming people are as knowledgeable as you are. Crypto = bitcoin to a lot of people. Minus the random 60+ and 10+ sells of eth and btc i saw these last few weeks its clear, to me anyway, that the market was not being propped by bank and institutional money. It seems like a lot of regular joes which is bullish to me.

I think coins that serve a platform will survive. I speaking of ethereum, stratis, and the likes. I fully think privacy coins will be replaced with a layered protocol like lightning network to bitcoin but thats down the road if planned at all so they will likely live on (monero, zcash etc).

I think everyone is quoting the FM incorrectly. I dont think they want to ban crypto but just illegal activities. They are also saying they dont want it accepted as legal tender; IE stores taking bitcoin and not the national currency. 
They do NOT care if you trade bitcoin for things however and im sure itll present loopholes for businesses.

How do you figure? When BTC was 10k, total market cap was 330B. For BTC to go to 100k and keep the same marketcap growth, that would mean total marketcap for all crypto would be 3.3Trillion. Less than half of gold.
Take away my percentage based numbers, the point is till there and valid. I am well aware of diminishing returns, doesnt take away that BTC could reach 100k, i dont see that point is relevant to the question.

No? pre-owned versus pre-run is very different. 
Bitmain builds, bitmain runs = pre-run
Bitmain builds, bitmain sells, new owner sells = pre-owned
I understand the points but pre-owned is not a bitcoin term and it strictly means something that was previously owned. Manufacturers arent owners.
This is like calling new vehicles that arrive on lot with 600miles on them, pre-owned. It is not.

This is correct but i dont think its going to the 100sat level because people want to use it. If buying bitcoin and paying for things becomes a simple process you just need to convince retailers or payment processors who can help make the switch.
Im not saying this is the plan just what i think would help the change. There is obviously other hurdles to overcome too.

Well lets see what it actually says about that:




Reverse confirmations for any transaction that had previously been seen in the block chain while he’s in control.
Prevent some or all transactions from gaining any confirmations
Prevent some or all other miners from mining any valid blocks
Note that the above limitations only apply to the perspective of Bitcoin as seen by full nodes.
And because of how lame this attack is, the link goes on to say


And further, a wild crazy response would be a hardfork but to change the PoW algo altogether to fire the miners? holy shit what a penalty for the attack!


EDIT - because of the full nodes, even if you had 99% of the hashpower, the damage is limited to the above and an immediately fork would take place. It would totally be chaos but the system can and would live on in the event of that kind of attack.
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:30:45

No, you also assumed how consensus with full nodes work and it was wrong (i think 1 or 2 posts up about the 51% longest chain bit). But I do appreciate you doing your research, you should check into that piece of your argument. :)

Your suggestion requires the majority of miners to shut off and not mine at a loss. Even though it was being reported that miners were shutting off due to loss, it wasnt a significant amount. 
Notice the lack of change in the hashrate being significant in either direction:


except the above chart shows that isnt true. I am also assuming how low theyd need to go before it becomes unprofitable but even touching 5k didnt seem to change the hashrate to a number worth a mention.
EDIT - In fact I am seeing the contrary. From the dip that started in February to today, the hashrate has almost doubled. 25,000,000TH to 45,000,000TH today

Eh. I was unable to move $4,500 through square without them getting an invoice or copy of the contract, 3 months of bank statements, thorough explanation of the service. 
I have been using Square on and off for about 3 years now. The rep said it was because "they wanted to be sure the account the money was going into was healthy enough to receive it." I issued a refund and ended up using other means to get the money (check... ha) but Christ almighty if they didnt act like the police and I needed to be cleared of something before I could get my $4,500. Its not even a lot of money.
So I dont want to hear this "CEO who loves bitcoin" BS. They are invasive with USD and if they love bitcoin so much, I would have been able to send that $4,500 using it.

@_date: 2018-07-26 23:52:43


I dont agree with this. Mining difficulty will decrease with less hashing power and a lot of miners hang around for the eventual upswing. It also opens up a new entry for new miners to come in on the cheap (equipment will be on wholesale!) and start setting break-evens and ROIs for the "new bottom, top and middle". I think youd see that prop up the number of miners so it would deflate the pool "slowly" even if the price tanked hard.
You also have the miners that need to contend with the [full nodes]( Full nodes are [inexpensive to run]( and abide by consensus rules that prevent from a lot of attacks although it does still have vulnerabilities if someone dropped in and dominated the remaining 20% hashpower as you gave in your example. Its just not doomsday stuff though.

Your bank might do this for you. You also allow the to use your funds as they sit. They are technically the banks and your account an IOU so theres really no issue there. I am glad you enjoy your first world priviledge.
In countries where this isnt possible, fees are outrageous. Citizens are charged for accounts simply because their country sucks. Look at venezula. They had no choice on how their money took a shit.

@_date: 2018-07-30 22:44:24


Lets. And lets go over this same example, again.
The hash power would deflate or even cliffs, as the price sank or cliffed. There is also a large number of farms that run far lower than others. But lets say, for our example, the threshold for the cheapest miners is 4k. At 1k, they are mining at a heavy loss.  As you say in your example, the bulk of miners shut off because of "mining in the negative" to the tune of 80% hashing power sitting idle.
You still have the consensus full nodes to deal with. And thats basically the end of the conversation as your idle hashpower sun and mining-in-the-negative-shut-off-miners asteroid shoot off into space. This isnt even discussing the new miners entering the arena in that 2 year span because equipment is wholesale from bankruptcies or failed rigs and difficulty adjusted after 2 weeks. Or worst yet - some miners even start to come back online.
EDIT - this also doesnt take into account the amount of money that will be loss from trying such an attack at such a low coin price.

Same goes for bitcoin and its current price points. Perspective matters. I saw in another thread someone was analyzing the last 3 months of all wallets and found that the larger wallets just continue to accumulate while the smaller, newer wallets were dumping. 
Newer users selling because they fear the loss, older wallets hodling cause they know something is up?
Maybe its just mining wallets mining and newer wallets were temp for a purpose, either way, interesting stuff.

This can be the case but the argument quickly falls apart when you look at how many people are using it on either side. Better does not always equal popular. 
With that said, I dont mind a changing landscape either. I wont ignore the gains I will clearly get ethereum in the short/mid term and as we all know, cryptos come and go quickly. 
Looking at just the tech, your comparison could be dead on. Its the foothold and adaption that ethereum is receiving that will keep it alive imo.
Full disclosure, BTC is 40% of my portfolio, ethereum is only 10%. I too think the future holds layering as the winner and its quite obvious BTC is the champion. I just dont plan to miss those sweet gains in the meantime ;) Im just saying, given the CURRENT state, there is a clear distinction between BTC and ethereum.

Is there a link to this post rather than a screenshot? How the fuck am I supposed to share this shit?

Why 2013-2015? If it wasnt marked a security then how can they back peddle like that? Just seems odd. You didnt avoid a tax if it never existed?

Ethereum does not accomplish the same task that bitcoin is attempting. Bitcoin is acting as a protocol and ethereum more as a platform. 
Looking at the two as they sit, i think the differences are rather clear without the semantics. Its not like ICOs are raging on bitcoin, for the exact reason of the dedicated platform purpose of ethereum. 
Phones can play music but an iPod does it better. Similar concept, i think.
@_date: 2018-04-19 11:44:18
I believe that to be the case, yup. 
@_date: 2018-04-19 12:48:06
I am not arguing that ICOs can be scammy. What I am saying is that there are also legitimate ICOs. For as many scam ICOs are you sourced (which deadcoins is not just for ICOs so your 790 number is inflated by a false reference, I frequent that site), there have been hundreds of successful ones that are REAL projects. 
This is not a mature space. Dont you recall the dotcom boom? Attaching internet to the name of your company guaranteed a 70% increase. 
See this paper detailing the phenomenon:
This is basically par for the course.
You seem stuck on the idea of ICOs being garbage complete regardless. I cant help but think you have some ulterior motives or are simply ignoring these details for your narrative?
@_date: 2018-04-03 11:44:23
Considering the same ratios with ETH, I think youre right.
@_date: 2018-04-19 12:59:41


I wont argue here, but this is why it is important to do your research.


Given the success of ICOs like ethereum, I dont think it would have affected its value. I'll agree we dont need more tokens.
@_date: 2018-04-19 12:23:06


I find this to be your opinion and I think history serves to show that ICOs are a successful launch platform.
@_date: 2018-04-12 16:50:44
Although you might be right, woz never had the chance to present his own tech. Could have been different without jobs.

So its 10nm not 16nm. Got anything for why they phyiscally look similar? Not sure research would have drawn any seperate conclusion, I dont think I am wrong there.

I too would like to see someone actually break down the data. Maybe r/dataisbeautiful but the info IS there. You can see the transactions if you follow the wallets. Its just pre-compiled the way you are looking for it.
@_date: 2018-04-12 17:54:28
This is important and NEEDS said. Too many casuals reading this stuff will attribute it to causation.

Not paying your taxes is not fighting for reform. Figure I should note this.

Because no one ever sees their break even. They wake up to ROI. Youre splitting hairs - ROI occurs miliseconds after break even.

Wait... didnt that guy lose 8k coins to a dump and is attempting to escavate? I think he also said it was from mining in 2009. Maybe theyre his?

Very interesting - thank you.
@_date: 2018-04-04 20:28:01
I think what OP is saying is that we and the 20-30% should stop giving a shit in the sense that the 20-30% should stop using it.

The correct assessment.

Wat. 
Youre staying in the know on the FUD but you dont know the roadmap for bitcoin? Segwit, lightning net, MAST, the institutional investors?
I am not going to convince you to keep your bitcoin. Sounds like your research is telling you to get out, any opinion to the contray wont matter.

right but i meant when it goes back on-chain to actually remove my bitcoin from my bitcoin wallet. Couldnt I potentially double spend? 
EDIT - the wallet is not actually mine its bitflyers, this makes sense - thanks everyone!
@_date: 2018-04-20 21:04:21
This sounds like a horrible idea with bitcoin unless we reach a point where 1 bitcoin = 1 bitcoin. Ie, not pegged to a dollar.
@_date: 2018-04-27 19:59:16
Hahahaha nailed it
@_date: 2018-04-14 13:57:10
But you dont have that huge farm and the mining is spread out. So youre talking about a situation that doesnt exist and if it were to, ASICs would certainly be a tool of choice.
ASICs are still awesome but i think they expect them to go elsewhere at this point. Look at ethereum. I personally think ASICs will be the defacto mining gear in the future. 
@_date: 2018-04-21 02:40:13
Im not talking about restricting someones freedom to rip someone off. Im talking about preventing people from ripping someone off. I think im missing something.

Its funny to call it the internet of money when theyre scared of layering.
Further, i also love how theyre calling it an electronic cash system. Thats actually what fiat systems are. I use bitcoin, not cash, for instance.

Fucking exactly.

I the bulk of people vocal about gold hate bitcoin. This forces them to stand a stance on their positions which I think might actually make some rethink their spot.
Also, negative press isnt bad for bitcoin. Look at wikileaks.

Any wallet recommendations? It sounds like this person might want to get their coins into an offline wallet and then send over to wasabi to mix? 
Any recommendations for how to clean the coins once dusted? It sounds like, if successful, your privacy could be compromised so to me it sounds like some directions to undust your shit is warranted if you happen to know kind internet stranger. :P
@_date: 2019-05-16 19:29:15
Explain to me how how it works then. You have all this knowledge so go balls deep. You dont know shit and thats okay.
To my point, you are simply connecting another means of communication. To people like you, this means stealing and compromise. To those that know a bit of how this works, it the exact same as honey hijack or bluetooth. You are passing your data via a stream. Dont act like honey didnt just record your shopping cart so it can find codes or your radio didnt just copy your contacts.
Smug asshole.

I am not recommending getting loans etc but for that situation, the app Earnin would be perfect for you. Not just for bitcoin but if you need some food before your check comes. You can get $200 for as cheap as $2 "tip" (up to you on how much). Its basically a pay advance with a potentially $0 fee.
@_date: 2019-05-12 15:19:01

This came off rude, was that the plan too? :(
@_date: 2019-05-21 02:19:40
Bitcoin has a larger acceptance and footprint to support layer 2 and 3. Bitcoin Cash attempted to replace 20th century money. Bitcoin is 21-22nd century money - its foolish to think we dont need layers and what i mean is bitcoin needs to be layer 1. It needs to be the means not the mode.
@_date: 2018-12-19 23:35:57
Your comment was dumb. Suggest something.
@_date: 2018-12-07 00:23:02
You may have a point there but i think it stands to reason it can still be held even if its currency. But i understand what youre getting at.
@_date: 2019-05-21 02:15:18
That and the cost. It would be expensive enough that doing someone else illegal would be cheaper. There is also the idea that it would be tank its value further removing its appeal.

The longest chain wins. Bitcoin had more hashing power, the community had decided. Bitcoin Cash still came about as a fork but was the split from the popular consensus which was decided by miners and validators (nodes).

So you confirmed what I said or youre just taking it value? If you think this "hijack" is wrong, consider Honey does it with coupon codes. So does the metamask wallet.
Being concerned with this hijack would mean you dont use bluetooth to connect to your car either.

It looks like they just hijack the payment channel and make the Visa/Mastercard purchase for you. You can use APIs with amazon to complete this so its not entirely surprising. The extension allows them to hijack your browser code.
They use a 3rd party then to process the transaction and actually take fees from the merchants just like a credit card so its no cost to you.
