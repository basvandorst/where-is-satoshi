So your alternative would've been to have no lifeboats?
The analogy is flawed, of course, because they were both responsibilities of the Venezuelan government to not let the ship (economy) sink and to have a plan B to protect its citizens.
Bitcoin is a ship that had nothing to do with the accident passing by and throwing life savers, and you're berating them for not having enough for everybody.

Venezuelan here. I don't think Bernie is the next Chávez. There was a pretty telling lead on Chávez that he wasn't a democrat, and that's of course that he first came into the public court as the commander of a military coup. Whereas with Bernie there's really no base to think he'll be an authoritarian ruler.

[Here's an article on why Bitcoin is of great use to Venezuelans, Argentinians and other Latin America citizens victims of troubled economies](

So you're saying that Bitcoin is being uncharitable? How does that even make sense?

Java only has by-value actually, it's just that you get the impression that it's by reference because when working with objects you can change the state of the actual object passed (on mutable objects, that is), but that's because the *value* you received was the reference of the object. However, if you replace the reference inside a method, like on the example above, you will not change the references to the old object outside the method.

haha the person who explicitly spoke about prohibiting Bitcoin being elected head of treasure is not relevant for bitcoiners because the article doesn't specifically mention the word "Bitcoin" ok

I would've really loved to see how much of a successful businessman he really is. If only he had released his tax returns...

That's what I'm contesting really, how wealthy is he? I have no doubt he's a millionaire, but he claims to be a billionaire. Why not shut everyone down and just release your tax return? Hillary did. If your claim is to be more transparent than Hillary then why not take this simple step towards proving that? I think it might be because he could be worth "only" 300 million dollars or some similar amount, and that would hurt his claim of being not only a good businessman but an exceptional one.

This is still a rumor but if it were true, wouldn't it be a contradiction with Trump's presidential platform? You obviously want someone with experience but does it have to be the most establishment banker of all the establishment?

Fair point, taken. Still, assuming he would get in power, then he would have to decide wether he wants to apply or not that ruling. In your example it would be like you becoming the head of Fort Knox and me asking "well, _are_ you going to stop me?"

It isn't really a good excuse if you consider he could've released his tax returns from previous years that are no longer over audit. And truly, he could've release his last tax return even under audit because, while I completely understand that's not the smartest move, you'd think the (then) candidate who promised to rescue the republic from the claws of hidden agendas would go the extra mile. I don't really expect him to release them after the audit is over, to be honest.

Oh, that's the beauty of Bitcoin isn't it? It's decentralized so it's hard to kill. The previous Argentinian government tried to stop it but it ain't that easy. I still think it's reasonable not to be happy with the people that do want to stop it to be in power.

So wouldn't property​ rights decrease the liberty of others to dispose of that property?
@_date: 2017-05-27 18:23:06
Right, sorry, English 2nd language, by "dispose" I meant to say "do as they please". But even if we're only talking about destruction, property rights limit the freedom of other people to destroy that property.
