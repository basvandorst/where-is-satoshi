I saw it go up and down from 12k to 10.8k like 3x... figured why not buy again at 10.9 and sell at 12k... guess its not going up now. RIP ME. I will check next week I guess.

What a dumb comment. Check price from February and compare it to today's price. I guess 150% return of your investment is not good enough? The stupidity is coming to a crypto subreddit and posting this dumb shit. Just cause a bunch of people posting to the moon, doesn't mean bitcoin is just a hype. Its the strongest crypto currency, and once it becomes limited and can no longer be mined. That "to the moon" phrase might actually be true.

Stock market doesn't operate on weekend??

I bought 24 hours ago at 10.9k :| Its ok cause someone had to take it for the team. Now we guzzle up that gas and go to the moon!

Just a slow return.

I was just gonna use Robinhood ride this hype train until monday and reinvest in other things.
@_date: 2019-06-22 03:18:40
Yeah I only wanted to ride some weekend hype, but its so scary and unstable. I won't be there to check on it if it crashes.  I am just not meant for crypto.
@_date: 2019-06-22 04:06:03
Yeah I swear, I appreciate your advice. I think It will go back up to 10800. Bitcoin should be a long time investment problem is its so unstable and everyone is scared after what happened last year.

I bought 1 coin at 10624\~  Is there a way you can set a limit with robinhood if it hits X to sell?
@_date: 2019-06-22 02:51:09
After getting some replies with the hype of 100k yeah I sold lol. I will take that $150 gain and catch the next hype after it crashes.
@_date: 2019-06-22 02:35:41
I never got into crypto... and this is fucking scary when you have moeny put in it. I might just cash out before a 12k\~ hype  I will take my $200 T\_T

I new to crypto. But that 10% peaked my interest. Figured I would put some and watch it spike up. Glad I got out before bed time. Seems the hype is dead now.   $140 aint bad for a 15-20min investment rofl . Eesh its going down and down as I type this.
