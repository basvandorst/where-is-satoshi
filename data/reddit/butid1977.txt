I've known Luke from way back, his knowledge and zeal is very real. I support him but I can't say I support his actions. 
For years he has called any other crypto-currency a scam, including Litecoin as recently as this week. He has programmed or otherwise been involved in attacks on other coins using the accusation of them being a scam as the reason for the actions. 
Now at this critical moment in Bitcoin's history people need to understand this: Luke considers BIP148 the righteous path, Bitcoin is now the 'legacy chain' and is a threat to the righteous one. Look to Luke's words today and you can see how this is already in motion. 
Bitcoin users and miners following the same code they have been for years are now the 'scamcoin' and will be treated as what Luke literally calls terrorists. This is absolutely terrible for the community and we are assured future drama because of it.

Luke is a prolific 'terrorist' himself, he has been involved in attacking other coins  because he felt like it. 
Now because he can't get his way he overtly is trying to kill bitcoin to force hashing over to the BIP148 altcoin. Miners went along implementing code as written, the only thing that has changed is core has stopped updating the block size. 
250kb/500kb/750kb blocks happened without much consideration or drama. Now Luke and co have halted development until people give into their threats so they can implement their side chains. This is despicable and the community is tiring of this terrorist BS.
