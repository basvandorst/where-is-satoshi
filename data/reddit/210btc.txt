Nice, now heres the simple explanation:
Society needs money to have a working economy. Economy = value. 
Gold was money, because of it's physical properties ie durability, divisibility, scarcity etc. It was the best thing for the job.
Bitcoin's properties as money now eclipse gold.
@_date: 2019-07-14 12:28:15
Its utility to be used as money, which is indispensable for a functioning society with an economy.

Gold is going up like a rocket. It seems really difficult for a lot of bitcoin morons to understand because your brains think in percentages rather than hard numbers

No because bitcoin is digital, no physical mass is being divided therefore 0.1 btc can be exactly the same as 0.01 if you change the base btc unit
@_date: 2019-06-02 17:34:48
No idiot because if you have 100 people who want 1 bitcoin you could give them 0.01 bitcoin and change the base unit to 0.01 now they all have 1 bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-02 17:44:00
OK some very stupid people in my comments. Say 1 satoshi in the entire world left. Just divide satoshi into 2.1 quadrillion more units and you regenerate entire bitcoin supply from 1 satoshi.
@_date: 2019-06-02 08:01:33
Hot take: if bitcoins are infinitely divisible, then they aren't actually scarce at all.
@_date: 2019-06-13 15:32:41
I'm actually going to short bitcoin after this post.

Best club I've ever been in, I can tell you.

its completely logical, a website can have multiple domains, is this your first day on the internet?

I know, thats why I'm suggesting a metal capsule. Your point is?
@_date: 2019-04-21 06:56:55
Buy Trezor One. Set it up with Trezor's web wallet.
Then download electrum and use your trezor with that.
If you want to go to town and verify your own blocks, then run a full node.
Fuck the metal plates people are shilling, its such a scam. Get a $2 waterproof capsule and put your paper phrase inside that

good point actually

I have a hardware wallet. Thats basically the only bitcoin gadget I know of. 
I wouldn't really call a casa node a gadget, its basically just a raspberry pi in a white box
@_date: 2019-04-28 17:05:27
once you've figured it out, make sure you get a hardware wallet asap
@_date: 2019-04-21 06:52:05
never heard of folex coin, and it's not even on coinmarketcap, so all i can say is you've won a legitimate giveaway of numbers on a MS Word document.
If I were you, I would ignore whatever that is, its probably a scam and they're just looking for your information details. 
I do recommend you learn about bitcoin though
@_date: 2019-04-28 16:43:31

@_date: 2019-04-28 17:55:09
Absolutely. Bitcoin is about financial sovereignty. Hardware wallets give you complete control over your bitcoin. All transactions are signed on the device, which is always offline. Your private keys are never exposed to the world, and are stored securely. Only the signed transactions leave the device via USB.
I recommend trezor, personally.

No, Venezuelas crisis was caused by mal-diversification of the economy. Chavez wanted to run the country like a national hedge fund, and he put all his eggs in the oil basket. He promised to diversify in the mid 2000s, but when oil prices took off, he decided to just drink champagne and sing songs instead of running the country. Oil price crashed, economy broke.
Really isnt difficult to understand!
@_date: 2019-05-09 21:19:20
Go learn about Venezuela you absolute mong. I hate dumb people so god damn much, where did you even learn this bullshit? I mean you obviously dont know a single fucking thing about economics or monetary policy at all, and got all your information from some complete idiot on youtube who has an AR-15 as his profile picture

living is cheap as fuck, its HOUSE PRICES that take up the vast majority of low income family's outcome.

In hardware wallets, all your private keys can be created from your 24 word seed. So whats the point? Just keep the seed secure.  Don't gamble on your security.

the state of this post. the entire thing.
you know, when bitcoin was at 18,000 i became extremely bearish because the entire of bitcoin reddit and bitcoin twitter had an average iq lowering to about 70, so I sold all my coins. When bitcoin went below 6,000 i realised the IQ had then raised to above 100 and i rebought
you are really making me reconsider the IQ again, maybe i should sell until this board becomes a bit more intelligent again
