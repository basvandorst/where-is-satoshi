On top of everything you said I feel like there is a systemic problem with bitcoin. 
I am new to all this so I very well could just be ignorant but...
"A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution."
That is the first sentence Nakamoto wrote in his whitepapers.
From my expirience with bitcoin in the world today you CAN NOT send online payments without a third party and fees.
Can someone explain to me if I am missing part of this extremely complex topic?

I don't understand Bitcoin. I don't understand how exchanges aren't consider a third party

I have a question about bitcoin. Ive been trying to learn more so I watched some Antonopoulos videos and read the white pages from Nakamoto.
From my understanding bitcoin is suppose to be a  peer-to-peer version of electronic cash allowing online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.
I am wondering though how this can be done? From what I am finding you have to go through a third party exchange.

That doesn't seem right. Nakamoto told us how it was suppose it work.

Thank you for your reply.  
I'm asking to clarify... To get bitcoin you need to either mine, use a third party exchange, or it is donated to you but then to use owned bitcoin you don't need a third party exchange to send through the network?
