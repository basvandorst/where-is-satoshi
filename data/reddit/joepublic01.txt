80mBTC isn't much. I just lost 1.8 BTC because I didn't backup my wallet.dat.

If you don't mind waiting a long time ... to save 30 cents.

If you purchased at $5 it's all good over $100.
@_date: 2014-05-16 07:31:01
But I clicked this one.

In 2011 I did web design work for which I was paid approx 100 BTC. It sounds like a big job now, but it was only worth $700 at the time. How would I prove the origin of those funds?

I actually pointed out that my previous employer has a strong business relationship with Bloomerg. And that Bloomberg also lists Bitcoin prices.

I've been traveling forward in time (at 1 second per second) with bitcoins obtained in early 2012. So far it's been very profitable, and I have not experienced any technical issues.

So instead of typing 'blockchain.info' into your browser's address bar, you typed it into google, then clicked on a dubious link?
Are we as a species becoming that lazy?

No my dismissal was totally unrelated to Bitcoin. I walked out due to the boss becoming abusive over other issues. 
However in legal proceedings my previous employer used obscure internet references linking my name to a Bitcoin startup, and made the statement in order to damage my reputation before the court.

Yeah. Put a QR code in your post.
@_date: 2014-05-25 08:36:25


Well I do have the address and transaction info. However I've lost contact with the person who paid me.

I've got a bridge for sale if you're interested.

Now there's something I wouldn't mind donating to (using BTC of course).
@_date: 2014-06-03 07:46:44
And I was depressed after my 1.8 BTC wallet. 
This must be the biggest stuff-up you've ever had. I don't know how you look at yourself in the mirror knowing there is little to no chance that you'll ever get them back.

Perhaps the next time we approach $600 we'll go through.
@_date: 2014-05-31 09:12:10
I'm guessing $2042 by end of year.

My iPhone 5 is the last Apple phone I buy until they stop banning Bitcoin apps.

Only three ways. You're lucky.
I like it when they block your account for receiving $X. Then it takes forever to get the block removed.
Or when they ALWAYS side with the ebay buyer who didn't receive their product despite having signature proof of delivery.

No, not a troll. But a long time reader, first time poster.

When I bought at $5 my wife said it was a bad investment.
Biggest regret was not buying $10K worth at $20. I thought it might drop back to 10-15, so I waited, and waited ... and now regret it. I had the cash all ready to go.

By default the wallet.dat contains 100 addresses. Unless you created more than 100, the backup should still work.
@_date: 2014-06-07 02:05:06
Only works with infinite stupidity.

Or saying that AAPL stock are somhow diminished every time there's another IPO.
