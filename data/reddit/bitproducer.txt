Bahaha. Now you're making me want to develop a website you can play monopoly with bitcoin in :)

Thanks I will, am trying to learn programming to develop for the blockchain

bitify.com is one, not sure about it's adoption though. Openbazaar is another, more popular, if you're willing to use Tor.
You could also sell items through a traditional website and use local bitcoins to buy bitcoins with the fiat if you're willing to go that route (kinda an exchange so cheating).

Hmm I've never really considered how putting it on the base layer could potentially cause security problems like that, so that's actually pretty intriguing

Not every wallet supports them properly yet or makes it easy enough for users. You could reply to that and say "Switch wallet" but for the average user they are going to stick with what is easy and familiar, and they're unlikely to worry about or recognise that segwit is something they should use.

In the short term maybe, this could be a bubble. It's not the first bubble bitcoin has been in though, and each time it has recovered and passed the last correction.
 The idea of a block chain itself is also sound and will have a place in the future. If you believe bitcoin is the revolutionary one in the long term then it doesn't matter if weak hands like your acquaintances get it and sell out in the short.

Yeah that's along the lines of what I was thinking, some of bitcoins future potential is in sidechains
