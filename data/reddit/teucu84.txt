Through bitpay? Of course no, they only let you choose between fixed fees, as far as I know. I got a few btc from a guy with 70 s/b and took 4 hours, I sent one with 5 s/b took me 15 minutes. I can't understand the use of high fees right now.

I just went to steam and set the amount of money I wanted in my wallet and this showed up. Plus the payment can only be sent in max 15 minutes, which is another stupid thing from them.

Elon musk is a complete idiot, he says shit without even thinking deeply, for example his last "big" project called Hyperloop. The only thing he did right (if i can say that) was paypal, other than that people does his work and he takes credit without too much effort.
