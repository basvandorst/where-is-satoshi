It's a serious subject, if a pill has the wrong active ingredient then it can have potentially lethal effects. For example, the original report for that pill was that it was a Piperazine (A cheaper ingredient that makes it a more dangerous pill to increase profits) and you've marked it as MDXX which would mean it was a good pill. That's the type of thing that could be very costly to somebody. I recommend you edit that as soon as possible. 
Harm reduction sites like PillReports are a great thing and it'd be a shame to ruin that by making false reports with the wrong information.

Hmm the only issue is that our precedent here in the UK is that of a surveillance state. We have CCTV everywhere. For our government they think it only natural that they can read everything.

Nope. Not that I'm aware of and even so, if there is its not much use if its not written down and legally binding.

There's the thing... We don't HAVE a constitution like the US does.

Yeah its only getting worse I'm afraid. Not much we can do though. Our wonderful overlords won't listen to a mere peasant like myself.

It sounds similar to the word for death and is considered bad luck. Much like some buildings in the US skip 13, some Chinese buildings skip 4. Japanese has the same superstitions as the word for 4 also sounds like death in Japanese.
