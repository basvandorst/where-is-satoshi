The natural disaster part may be a bit exaggerated and even if such threats happen Bitcoin doesn't seems more vulnerable than Western Union.
Anyway, very complete answer overall!

Thanks a lot, this is crazy, people giving tips like it's karma!

What service do you have?
@_date: 2014-10-18 21:32:41
Mozilla makes most of it's money from Google partnership which is a problem for independence and durability.
It would be better for them to live from individual donations.
What make you way Mozilla doesn't use it's money to pay development costs?

In French thats the phonetical equivalent of Dickmobile or Cockmobile...

Thanks! :-D

If you get 10GB of cloud storage by sharing 10GB of your hard drive, how can there be redundancy?
Maybe we can assume that globally only n% of cloud storage will be effectively used and therefore can be used to replicate data?

There are breaks you know at office, so presumption of guiltiness is not applicable.

You are not helping your side (which is also mine if I had to pick) and it's a shame that your behavior will be used as and excuse for extreme moderation and discrediting pro large block arguments.
@_date: 2015-01-06 17:42:37
ok, thanks for the explanation
@_date: 2015-01-04 23:42:10
Well maybe it's good to not cheat on taxes for someone who as decent revenues?
@_date: 2017-03-20 07:23:36


Where did you see that ? That seems false. Almost all the blocks are full for every major pool including AntPool which I guess is the one you're referring to.
@_date: 2017-03-20 07:10:37
From what I understand, a 51% attack would be controlling more than 51% of the hashpower to block or reverse transactions, so no it isn't.

Except Jeff Garzik, Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen who were the biggest early contributors after Satoshi. And who are not anymore in the Bitcoin Core team due to disagreements mainly about the blocksize debate, is this correct?
@_date: 2017-01-25 12:00:40


How do we know that? There is no healthy debate, hate from both sides + overly strict moderation makes hard to make an informed decision.
@_date: 2017-01-25 12:02:23


Can the name calling stop? On both sides. Who want to join such discussions when reading that?
@_date: 2017-04-26 18:05:41


What were these statements? Weren't they the current usability issues?
@_date: 2017-09-06 22:15:50
And also malware (just a malicious browser extension is enough) that changes the addresses that you see in your browser.
It seems pretty difficult to protect against these attacks at a reasonable cost. Any idea? (better that always double-checking on a second device that it dedicated to that. Without much stuff installed on to limit the risks)
@_date: 2017-09-09 22:36:52


Could the 5 remaining words have been found by brute-forcing? Brute-forcing 12 words isn't feasible, but 5 is way easier, considering this is exponential. (assuming phone compromission)
But that would be a targeted attack (which could be possible, you're the one that could know if this should be in your treat model)
@_date: 2017-09-06 22:12:31
Malware that changes addresses in the browser is even better, even with checking the HW wallet, you are pwned.
@_date: 2017-09-07 19:09:11
Thanks for these detailed guidelines for a high level security without an hardware wallet.


Not many people needs to reach such level of security.
The first step is to establish a treat model. Many people should be more vulnerable to loss of coins (without a 3rd party involved) than the threat of a hardware manufacturer.
Especially when the software running on the computer isn't made by the manufacturer and is libre/open source (e.g. electrum) so it would be very hard for the manufacturer to steal the coins, isn't it?

Does backlog = mempool?
Do you have an idea where I can find these statements? My search queries with these too generic words were unsuccessful.
@_date: 2017-07-07 22:54:00


That echos to "this whole topic has become to big for one person to be able to judge/fact check everything in a reasonable time"


After a diagonal rereading I don't see something like a prediction but **I reread it to quickly for a reliable conclusion.**


That could be an argument for both sides.
@_date: 2017-06-24 00:19:06


Thanks for the pointers. As for Mike's rage-quit, it's hard to judge, it seemed backed with serious reasoning and facts overall.
I'm sad that this whole topic has become to big for one person to be able to judge/fact check everything is a reasonable time.
@_date: 2013-11-03 17:12:34
By looking like Italo Vignoli :-P
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:41:52
Is the data on usebitcoin.info free? (as in freedom) 
So we could maybe cross information with OpenStreetMap which is the data source for coinmap.org
@_date: 2013-07-10 16:51:49
Sublim Text looks great but it's too sad it's not Free/open source :-(
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:29:56
"The wiki" -&gt; [the bitcoin wiki](
@_date: 2013-08-22 23:25:39
Same thing in France, I think the SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) allows us to transfer this easily
@_date: 2013-11-26 00:04:42
Are you ok with using the data from usebitcoins.info to contribute to OpenStreetMap? (the free/libre source of data behind coinmap.org) 
Because I couldn't find the license of the data on your website :-(
