He hit the nail on the proverbial head. Cryptocurrencies have no barrier to entry. Even if the technology works out, it has nothing to do with the "value" of a given coin. You can use a cryptocurrency worth $0.01 to accomplish the same "transmission" of money. There is nothing special about bitcoin other than its first mover advantage. That advantage can be easily eroded (see AOL, Napster, Myspace).

Exactly. Imagine an e-mail service you have to pay for vs one you don't. Most people would choose the free service. Right now, bitcoin is expensive. Most would rather use another currency to transfer money.

You could use the same logic of any stock that has surged high in a bubble. Many people "bought into" Pets.com in the late 90's.
Bitcoin is just a ledger. Someone can make a similar ledger for US Dollars, thus bypassing conversion into crypto currencies, then viola: secure transfer of money.

Yeah, $100 was hit on some exchanges after the bet (before $10K) now. I couldn't find at that time. 
Has $10K even been hit yet? If enough people here think I lost (ie., it never actually hit $100), then I'll gladly give gold to (who may no longer exist).
EDIT: sorry, looks like it was who really accepted the bet.

Remember when India was seen as the source of demand that would keep gold prices up?
