That was very helpful thank you.
@_date: 2018-01-01 05:41:38
Thanks!  How do you "sign" the pubkey and other data?  Simply by mashing the two data together?  Or is it hashed as well?
@_date: 2018-01-10 04:35:34
Could you help me understand why it would be important for Breadwallet to constantly be scanning for the user's funds if it adopts segwit?  AFAIK, referencing for segwit SPV wallets to segwit nodes shouldn't be any different for legacy wallets to legacy nodes.
And what are the dangers of creating segwit addresses from the initial chain of legacy addresses?
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:09:22
edit: testnet!
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:33:55
So it's a matter of extending the blockchain faster than the original blockchain?  Nodes would then delete their versions and download the new one?
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:39:56
Is this how SPV don't have to download the whole blockchain?
@_date: 2018-01-01 05:50:32
You're god send.
@_date: 2018-01-01 05:50:55
Awesome ty!
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:55:49
Mobile wallet is definitely on the to do list.
@_date: 2018-01-01 06:20:37
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:48:10
Oh okay.  so the min. relay fee is to determine which tx's stay in the mempool.
Then is the min. tx fee just a default suggestion?
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:37:33
The prepaid mastercard is a good analogy.
But I would say it's locked because that's what prepaid $$ is right?  You can't spend it anywhere except for places that accept mastercard.
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:47:03
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:43:33
Also, is nonce essentially the solution miners are looking for?
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:54:47
Oh sorry!
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:06:15
Yea it is a lot.  We've still got a long ways to go till plug and play.
Have you tried looking at neutrino?
@_date: 2018-01-29 03:53:42
Fake timestamps.  Didn't know you could do that.
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:43:02
Is the block hash the same as the tx id?
@_date: 2018-01-10 03:48:47
You're right.  Weight.
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:45:15
tx happen off chain so you don't have to mine these tx's.
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:42:36
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:25:42
Yea that's the hope.
Businesses haven't implemented segwit so I'm unconvinced just because it's available that it will be implemented.
@_date: 2018-01-31 08:13:23
Okay i'm completely new to understanding mining so plz bear with me.  Sorry :(
SHA256(blockheader + nonce)&lt;difficulty?
From the latest block:
SHA256 (	000000000000000000297ae30ca8b102fab65ed864ec292f2c25f36117e97e47 + 2586719437) &lt; 2,603,077,300,218.59
So why don't I just use 1 as a nonce if it'll be lower than the difficulty?
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:41:22
Okay one more question.
Let's say I started from the genesis block and started mining.  I get that with our current hashpower, we'd blow through the first 2016 block in an instant.
But wouldn't the mining difficulty readjust to our current standards?  Therefore, would it revert back to 10 minute time periods on block 2017 and on?
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:07:20
Lightning does not have full nodes.  
I'm sure it can but it will take time.
Not sure about ledger/trezor.  It will be up for them to decide.  
@_date: 2018-01-29 03:52:02
Okay let's say the current blockchain is like 10,000 blocks.
The attackers starts with the genesis block and mines the first 2016 blocks.  He does this pretty fast because the difficulty is so low.  Let's say 1 second per block.  Then, wouldn't the node readjust the mining difficulty?  
Therefore, the next 2016 blocks would be subject to 10 minute intervals instead of 1 second intervals.
This way the attacker would never catch up to current 10,000 blocks.
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:55:34
That was an incredibly thorough response and exactly what I was looking for.  Thank you sincerely for taking the time to respond.  
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:51:38
So these are just recommended settings but each user/miner can set for themselves.  interesting.  Thank you.
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:07:22
It’s as close to a plug and play ln wallet as you can get for the LN. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 08:13:05
Can you flush that out a bit more for me?  I'm not following
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:17:43
Not sure.  Cuz you’ve got to convert 1 to 3 addresses so it’s an extra layer?   
Just curious why mobile wallets haven’t implemented it yet
@_date: 2018-01-31 08:00:26
Got it ty.  Sorry about that.  
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:04:50
Shout out to subz from litecoin IRC who made this video!
@_date: 2018-01-09 06:59:51
Could you clarify the "No locking up of funds" part?
Cuz the LN definitely does that.
@_date: 2018-01-31 08:02:50
So I keeping hashing the blockheader with a nonce to get a number below the difficulty?
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:27:45
beautiful thank you.  That's what I was thinking but just needed someone else to verify.  &lt;3
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:00:46
Sorry testnet.
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:58:37
So the wallet itself uses the Address to receive the tx.  Thanks for your patience.  
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:58:01
I just would like to understand why they chose to go with the LN as opposed to the Bitcoin NG protocol which seems to directly address the mining centralization problem many are wary of.
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:48:43
Sorry one more question, when I input a btc address into my wallet to send, how does it generate the pub key if it’s just one way?
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:43:20
Why not just do a testnet version of this.  Seems worthwhile because it solves the problem of scaling a lot better than bigger blocks 
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:08:35
So test it?
Why isn't the LN being tested on a side chain first then?
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:25:15
When my wallet performs op_checksig, how does it know that the signature of the private key corresponds to the validated pubkey?  Does this have to do with ECC points?
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:53:26
Right.  I read about collission but it seemed like such a small chance it seemed inconsequential.
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:46:10
Do you know what the purpose of a brd token is?
@_date: 2018-09-19 14:11:53
No.  Fees pay the miner who secure and process transactions.  
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:08:24
hmmm I can't seem to find a guide.  Do you have a link?
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:37:59
But with the CT "secret key", addresses are auditable.  Couldn't your gov't simply order you to reveal the amount in your addresses in order to determine if you actually send BTC out?
@_date: 2018-09-19 05:16:34
Yup!  A LN channel requires 2 transactions (1 to open and 1 to close).  From there, any payments used don't go "on-chain."  Therefore you can make payments without bloating the blockchain.  So really it's more a question of how much will a person use the LN.  That will ultimately determine the order of magnitude in which the LN scales BTC.
Also, it'd be cheaper to get on the LN with LTC which people can then Atomic Swap.  You could even submarine swap LTC to BTC to "refill" your LN node.  This will free up even more blockspace for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-09-19 14:15:56
Wow.  Props to you!
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:43:37
But who gets to decide what comes to Bitcoin?
Why should the LN be preferred but not NG?
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:32:55
Sorry.  reading through the dev-guide and didn't give context.  But according to the dev-guide.
Alice send Bob 1 btc.  
Bob wants to spend it.
Alice's pubkey script runs OP_EQUALVERIFY to verify the pubkey hash decoded from Bob's btc address with the pubkey hash generated from Bob's pubkey.
Alice's pubkey script then runs OP_CHECKSIG which:


In this sentence, how does op_checksig find out if the signature matches with the public key?
@_date: 2018-09-28 14:25:49
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:11:42
I don't think the public key is the address itself.
"A Bitcoin address is a 160-bit hash of the public portion of a public/private ECDSA keypair."
If I understand that correctly, the 1PrkNZmdV1mWT6UyE9SAtVYgf3G1fzBi2s is a hashed version of the public key no?
@_date: 2018-09-22 21:28:07
IC.  
So he just reported the DoS.  Corallo found the inflation bug.  But he most likely wouldn't have found it w/out the initial report.
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:52:50
so only one address can be created from the public key correct?
block explorers are basechecking the pubkeys to create that address we all see?
You can't create 1000's of addresses from one pub key?
@_date: 2018-09-19 14:15:32
Read through [this series]( to understand the Lightning Network.
Here's where I explain why [LTC would be a cheaper onramp]( to the LN.
@_date: 2018-09-19 13:10:38
You're right.  Some reason I switched it up.  Should be multiplied by 3.7
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:26:56
first of all great explanation.  Had no idea CT could have 0 amounts.
Isn't the idea "there's too many tainted coins with the hated address therefore we're not going to track any coins" taking too much for granted?  
If companies like coinbase were to come outright and say "any addresses tied to this blackmarket address will not be accepted," then less people would be willing to help you throw off observers from your bitcoin trail.
@_date: 2018-09-22 00:39:54

ah okay so they basecheck it themselves and create a database then match it up.  Perfect.  ty so much!
@_date: 2018-09-19 14:34:24
I see your point.  Yea it’s possible to port the tech into their chain. The problem I see is that they would have to demonstrably prove that their network is secure.  Otherwise people wouldn't want to open channels with them cuz then the channel could disappear.

In this scenario, it seems like sbtc's blockchain would be depending on the 10 min. blocks.  
How would this work if the block times are different?  
SBTC  \(1min\)
BTC \(10 min\)
You couldn't really be sure if the hashes recorded on SBTC are included in BTC until BTC's block are submitted.
@_date: 2018-05-19 21:18:24
reorg.  ty.
@_date: 2018-05-19 15:42:10
That seems to address the scenario of 1 invalid block.  What if a miner with 33% goes off line, mines 6 blocks, and then broadcasts it?
@_date: 2018-05-17 22:04:57
So it seems like it won't cost miners too much extra resources to merge mine while the coin benefits from the same security.
@_date: 2018-05-17 22:27:31
But where are SBTC's hashes being left if they're only recorded in BTC's blocks every 10 minutes?  
@_date: 2018-05-21 16:22:01
Honestly it’s the term “smart contract”.  It’s misleading.  People think it’s a separate layer on top of sending txs or something when in reality it’s just the expansion of script.

Wait could you break down how hashing twice allows for 20 second blocktimes?
@_date: 2018-05-21 06:15:00
Yea I really appreciated this video.  I had to mull it over several times.  The blockchain space itself is still 1mb.  But the tx's hashed into what's left in the blockspace push it to potentially 4mb.  Really something else.
@_date: 2018-05-21 06:15:18
That my friend, is the feeling of your bitcoin knowledge expanding. :-D

@_date: 2019-03-26 16:37:01
Well profitability is tied to hashrate security.  And I bring up the effects of profitability on hashrate in each halvening.




This isn't true.  We've been in a bear market for over a year now.  And it's been "slightly profitable" for a while and has affected the hashrate.  


I agree with you here.  But it takes time (months) for new miners to join the ecosystem.  And the bull can be so large that it gives a huge profitability advantage to current miners as opposed to those just trying to get on.

@_date: 2018-10-18 16:56:35
I don't understand your argument.  Of course they'd prefer to pay 1 USD to open the channel.  
But the idea would be to open a $1,000 channel so they could pay you repeatedly $50 so they don't have to keep paying transaction fees.  And businesses often bite the bullet when it comes to paying their employees with direct deposits, etc.
@_date: 2018-10-22 14:28:51
@_date: 2018-10-18 05:11:24
\&gt; How are people going to get new channels opened?
IMHO, there will need to be a raise in blocksize if BTC wants to function as a world wide currency even if tx's get offloaded via sidechains and LN.  But if it just wants to be a reserve currency, the high tx fee may just be something people bite the bullet for.
Alternatively, let's say you pay $50 to open a channel.  Every time you make a payment on the LN, that gets cut in 1/2.  So the more payments you make, the less your fee is per tx.
\&gt; I mean, sure channels will still be opened. there are companies and rich people that would do this at this point.
The thing about this is that you can get paid in the LN.  I imagine companies paying the tx fee to open a channel with you so you don't have to pay a dime.  From there, all you have to do is route LN payments for your everyday needs.  So you may rarely ever have to pay a tx fee.
\&gt; But this also means that Bitcoin will become some sort of a credit-hybrid financial system.
What makes you say that?  Every BTC is accounted for.  LN are BTC transactions.  You can credit someone with extra BTC.  That's why channels are capped to the BTC you fund them with.

With the LN
1. $5 fee (it's the median fee RN) to open and close 1 LN channel with $100
2. Near 0 cost to make a payment once it's opened.  $3 a coffee.  Round down to 33 coffees for the month.
3. $5/33= $.15 per tx.
W/out the LN
1. BCH median fee is $0.119.
The difference is that the more $$ you put down (or more tx you have), the less it costs per tx.  
With LN
1. $5 fee with $200 in.
2. $5/66=$.075 per tx.

that's strange.  When I help people try to recover their coins, I've sent many people to electrum. I believe it uses bip 39 but it doesn't seem to work.
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:59:14
Some wallets have different derivation paths.  You shouldn't expect them all to be the same.  For example, breadwallet seedkeys won't work on electrum.
If you want to simply check your account, why not use an explorer?  
That way you're not repeatedly exposing your seedkeys.
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:02:45
ty :)
@_date: 2017-11-18 07:36:47
Lol I didn't even ask a question.  Is it wrong to express my opinion?
BTC doesn't process nearly the same amount of tx as VISA.  
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:14:26
One possible make shift option is to use Electrum, stick it in a thumb drive, then disconnect it from your computer.  This would turn your electrum wallet into essentially a cold wallet until you reconnect it.  
Plus if it ever gets damaged and you've written down the seedkeys, you can easily recover it by simply downloading it again.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:37:34

Best way to protect your coins is to put them in a [cold wallet]( then write down your seedkeys and store them somewhere safe.

@_date: 2017-11-18 07:50:20
True.  but if your only reason is "adoption" then you're already going to lose that battle.  $10 in fees will push people to look elsewhere.
Look I'm a bitcoin fan.  but I'm also a realist.  btc needs to scale.  Everyone knows that.  Scaling tech includes LN, Schnorr sigs, sidechains, etc.  It's exciting stuff.
But let's have a measured and realistic perspective of the state of btc now.

One more follow up question in regards to SPV mining.
If a SPV miner tries to submit a block with a tx that's already been processed (but they don't know it has because they're still downloading the latest block), do nodes reject this submitted block?
Do nodes then move to the next submitted block?
@_date: 2017-11-20 06:32:38
ledger and trezor are both great.  I personally have a ledger.
@_date: 2019-10-23 09:09:37
Questions 1 and 2 need clarification.
\&gt;Can one go in and out of the extension block or is it just one way?
Yes you can go both ways.
\&gt;Can full nodes verify the supply limit? I'd imagine if there was inflation inside the extension block full nodes would not see it?
Full nodes won't be able to verify the supply limit. But one advantage of EB is that the supply limit will never exceed 84 million on the canonical chain. Bad news is that if there's inflation, it's possible you'll be stuck with it in the EB side.
\&gt;What is the impact on full nodes? Are they forced to download extension blocks as well?
Old nodes don't need to DL extension blocks. This is why it's a soft fork.
@_date: 2017-11-20 05:09:42
There's a fee because miners have to process it.
If you're sending from a wallet you own (not from an exchange) you can most likely set a lower custom fee.
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:49:03
What exactly are you scared of?
It's legal to buy Bitcoin.

Right by themselves they can't.  but what if you split up a quadrillion dollar transactional volume amongst 4-5 currencies scaled with layer 2 with btc as the backbone storevalue it's possible
@_date: 2017-11-25 07:57:33
Okay sorry just to be clear, if my tx is in the orphaned block it goes back to the mem pool and I don't have to broadcast my tx again right?
@_date: 2019-12-06 05:09:36
CJ's with public txns are really difficult and not practical because you have to match amounts. With hidden amounts, you can CJ any output with each other.

I was merely pointing out a possibility of combining the two technologies of MW (implemented with extension blocks) and Lightning *because* MW has Schnorr. I do not want MW just because it has Schnorr.


Beam has a working demo of Lightning: 
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:05:23
If you don't want a hardware wallet then yes try a paper wallet.
A Paper wallet is two QR codes.  One of your address and one of your private key. It's safe because it's not connected to the internet and can't be corrupted (outside of wear and tear).
Another option is to use Electrum, stick it in a thumb drive, and then disconnect it.  You'd want to write down the seedkeys on a piece of paper just in case your thumbdrive gets corrupted.  But it's easily recoverable.  Download Electrum from here   Then follow [this guide](  It's written for Electrum-LTC but the general idea remains.  Drop Electrum into a thumbdrive then disconnect.  (make sure to skip the part where you download it form electrum-ltc.org.  This is cause you need to use an electrum btc wallet, not an electrum ltc wallet).

@_date: 2019-12-05 02:54:39
No. I personally don't think so. Sidechains are federated and is a lot more centralized. Extension Blocks are basically grouped anyone-can-spend txns and therefore leverage Bitcoin's inherent security.
@_date: 2019-12-09 20:24:35
Yea I wish we had caught that he was screen sharing the entire time. It was a cool concept. Basically people like street performers could accept BTC tips via Lightning while you just walk around. (I think we're talking about the same project lol. There were a couple NFC projects).
@_date: 2017-11-18 08:06:12
When you send a btc tx, you don’t have to use the custom tx fee.   You can custom set a lower one in most wallets.  It’ll probably get processed slower but it’ll still go through. If it takes a while, you can use RBF to increase it to push it through. 
@_date: 2019-12-05 03:01:58
Also one of the benefits of MW is that it uses Schnorr. Should Bitcoin ever implement Schnorr (btw huge shoutout to the [Taproot+Tapscript+Shcnorr Review club]( we could implement a Schnorr based Lightning Network. There's already been some discussion around this and one of the proposals is called [Payment Points]( 
This would provide an incredible amount of privacy:
1. MW to hide amounts.
2. Lightning Network to break txn linkability.

You should use GDAX.  It's an extension of coinbase.  Get verified first.  Then you'd have to deposit $$.  You could study during the week it's getting processed.
Or if you're scared it's going to get higher, simply buy it through coinbase and bit the fee bullet.

Is hiding the amounts sufficient privacy in your opinion? 
Current alternatives I can think of to break txn linkability for MW require more trusted setups and make UX a bit more difficult at the base level (i.e. CJ's into a CJ mixer before the txns get broadcasted).

2. You said twitter.  Not github.  And there’s a diff between going through the “read.me” and hearing the ins and outs of it.  You get more insight this way.
3. Our conference is not motivated by greed.  $10 tix is incredibly affordable and 80% of our tix sales go straight to the speakers.  I feel like you should be happy that we are providing an alternative to the conferences you just railed against. 
4. You don’t know how laughable it is to say that people should hold the conferences for free.  They are incredibly expensive to put on.

You can pick and choose sessions for $10/session.  That's pretty affordable to me, considering average conference tix are $399 + housing/travel.

But seriously, I was perusing the comments above...
So there is a difference between a LN full node and a Bitcoin Core full node?  
Does an LN full node require you to download the blockchain?  Or has the definition shifted for a LN full node to be aware of all the channels in the network?
Lastly, is the difference between an SPV LN node and a full LN node simple that the SPV connects to a full node and doesn't know the channels of the network?
@_date: 2018-11-15 23:03:00
It's because the mempool is clogged.  You can RBF with a higher transaction fee if you enabled it.

I think without the patent, Bitmain would've started overtly mining AsicBoost and the hashrate distribution would've been worse.  It played a pretty significant role in keeping the network safe after Segwit made covert mining ineffective.  So the patent is pretty big deal IMO.  Without it, we'd probably be in a danger zone.

@_date: 2019-01-27 04:31:15
It's not an extreme opinion.  It makes a lot of sense if you do the math.
1. BTC's blockchain size is around 200 GB. It's grown 50 GB/yr past 3 years. If you buy a $140 desktop with 500 GB, it'll only last you 6 years.
2. You can also see in [this chart]( that blocks have grown exponentially in the past. It can also grow exponentially until the blockweight limit of about 3.7mb is hit.
3. For example, current blocksize average around 200 kB. 400 kb is 2x. 800 kb is 2x. 1.6 mb is 2x.
@_date: 2018-03-05 16:02:57

Sure nodes can charge fees.  But Autopilot pushes a scale free network which disincentivizes supernodes because it compromises structural integrity.  Also, just because you are a supernode doesn't mean transactions will always go through you.  Finally, even if supernodes exist, they're significantly handicapped through neutrino and onion routing.

If you have a ledger, I would store it all there.

You do it when you create the paper wallet.  For example, let's say you're creating a bitcoin paper wallet through a website.  Sometimes it'll ask you if you want to "encrypt it."  Say yes.  Type in a password.  It'll create a QR codes that not only carry your pub/priv keys, but also the password you created.  
So when you go to withdraw your coins, the program will recognize it's encrypted and ask you to type in your password before you can access them.
@_date: 2017-09-12 15:27:52
Thanks for your detailed comments and I appreciate your feedback.


Everything is randomized therefore there is no one to regulate/control/guide whether there'll be enough connected nodes to ensure structural integrity.




I addressed this in my article.  It's through autopilot.


I explained this through onion routing.


This is in regard to structural integrity of the LN.  People assume these nodes will be controlled by banks or gov't which isn't true.  They can set up nodes but there's no guarantee people will connect ot them.


It's a summary of what Neutrino is.  I linked the github if you want to know more. If you know how light wallets work, they download parts of the blockchain in order to perform their transactions and save them.    This article is geared towards the more experienced cryptoinvestor and therefore I assumed previous knowledge of how this works.  Perhaps I can explain it more in the article.
@_date: 2018-02-23 17:58:51
For me it'll demonstrate how much network effect coinbase/bitfinex has which has a lot of implications.

Haha true.  I guess the advice is more for traders.
@_date: 2017-10-03 02:38:56
Yes and no.  Depends on when you try to cash out.  There is no replay protection so you can't cleanly split your btc from the paper wallet even if you scan a wallet for the legacy chain and then for the 2x chain.  If you'd have to wait for the dust to settle in order to do it cleanly. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 08:38:11
IMO the dip to $1800 was because of all the FUD behind the fork.

1. Bitfinex full segwit support (outside of bech32)
2. Coinbase rolling it out but GDAX has it.
3. Core release tagged with segwit support.
What percentage do you think segwit be at by 3/2 next week?
My hunch is 45% cuz of the coinbase/bitfinex.

I guess in a broader sense, in distributed networks a node can be a redistribution point and a communication end point.  It seems as if the non portforwarding nodes are a communication end point.
Also in distributed networks, a supernode is one that redistributes data (which seems to be a portforwarding node). 
@_date: 2017-10-02 22:58:46
The moment you lose non-mining nodes you lose decentralization which means you lose bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-16 21:04:49

I don't think it's that they don't need users, it's that they assume users will follow hash power only.  
@_date: 2017-09-14 01:33:26
Segwit groups transactions together.  MAST hides the grouped transactions by assigning a Merkel root to each of the transactions.  When a node looks at a group, all it needs to see is the merkel root to confirm that an actual transaction took place.  I can send you my article on it if you want more clarity.
Onion routing hides addresses from nodes.  So you can tell who sent what to whom.  You also can't see how many hops it has left.  
Neutrino (lightwallet) will not save blocks it loads.

@_date: 2017-10-27 07:25:33
Ok ic.  So i gues here's the problem that I see and i'm confused with.
When I first DL bitcoin core, I need to make it publicly connectable (like portforwarding).  Something I didn't know.  Does this mean that it is no longer a full node because it doesn't help relay tx and allow others to check their blockchains with yours?
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:06:06

Most of the tx's in the bitcoin network are from businesses like coinbase/bitfinex. 
It's very relevant in the sense:
1. How much them implementing or not implementing affects the network.
2. Explores the narrative that businesses can pos/neg affect the network through something like fees by aligning their interests together.

@_date: 2017-10-02 21:09:05
That’s one possible option.  Personally I’d put it in my own wallet so I can control how it’s split.  If you have a ledger, they’ll split it for you.  
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:47:09
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:48:32
Depends on how many mining nodes there are.  Non mining nodes need to be the majority.  Or else mining nodes get to dictate everything.

@_date: 2017-09-12 03:57:25
It's not.  The point is that there will be things in place to protect users from highly connected nodes.  A scale free typology is slightly more centralized but more efficient.  Additionally, a scale free typology is a minimum spanning tree with no loops.   If it does loop then it immediately becomes a whole lot more centralized.
@_date: 2017-09-28 05:44:43
Of all the stuff I've read, this makes the most sense.  Especially the lack of technology part.  Perhaps in the next 5 years we will be able to handle both segwit and 8mb blocks.  But right now it seems as if only the major btc companies are capable of doing so.  Thank you  for your insight.

@_date: 2017-10-02 21:19:37
I'm talking about the ticker used for trading pairs.  You can't label it "Core" or "Segwit2x".  It's too long and it'll confuse a hell of a lot of users. Also, it's not worth relabeling coins if you're simply going to revert it back in a week or so.

Wells Fargo is shady AF.  They upgraded my account without telling me and charged me to keep my account going.  I only found out by looking at my bank statement the next month.  I called them and asked them WTF.  How is it possible to upgrade my account without my permission.  Their customer service told me "we sent you emails and mails."  I said, "Hell no you didn't.  Even if you did, you should only be able to upgrade my account with my permssion.  It's better to freaking suspend the account rather than upgrade it with account charges."  Then I asked for their manager.  Manager told me they sent warnings through an email and mailing address I never registered with them and said it was my responsibility to check my email/address and didn't refund my money because it was a month after the fact.  
I closed down my account and withdrew all my money the next day.
