That "blue" are the customers.  They are the reason any internet service provider exists, in a free market.  A service provider has an incentive to cooperate with the customer, and other providers, to provide the best service possible.  Net Neutrality has only existed for 3 years, it was established in 2014.  With government control and manipulation, those incentives are removed.  AT&amp;T, for example, is a government controlled and created monopolistic entity.

Makes total sense, right?
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:22:48
How so?
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:34:52
You are for Net Neutrality, and speak of free markets?  Contradictory.  
Government creates the monopolies you speak of.

"Transaction data" is data.  We know it is possible to encode *specific* types of data into a transaction.  Since this is possible, we can assume that a user had *intention* to attach child pornography to a transaction in the form of "data" as you say, which can indeed be "decoded" by software.  It is silly to say that the "software" itself is creating the child pornography, which is to say, that *all* transaction data exists in a way that is completely indistinguishable.  This is clearly not the case.  Images are encoded in a specific fashion, text is encoded in a specific fashion.  The data encoded within the transaction is not simply indistinguishable data, it was written in such a way that enables it to be interpreted, and this is the problem.  Regardless of what software is used to interpret the transaction data, which in turn renders the image, the data itself is the problem.  When you view an image on your computer, it does not matter what software you use to view said image, as long as the data is encoded as an "image".  The law is a completely different debate.  I think intent is most important.

One output is too small to contain an image, correct, which is why there are multiple address in array needed to allocated enough space to fit an entire image.

A major difference between Wikipedia and a blockchain being that such offending content on Wikipedia is not a requirement for it's operation, one might want to consider.  I am no cryptographer, but as far as I know, removing data from Bitcoin's blockchain, if even possible, would render it unusable.  Consider the following in regards to this "hack" - as far as I'm aware, Bitcoin transactions are not encrypted, and thus illicit data within a transaction is not ambiguous from other transactions, and thus requires no additional "data" or "information" to execute or interpret it.
*"Normally we see these addresses in their Base58 format. However, in essence they are all just 20-byte binary strings. To save a file on the block chain, it should be divided into 20-byte chunks (adding zeroes to the end of the last chunk if needed). Then, to indicate the end-of-file, one must append the RIPEMD-160 hash of the original file to the list of file chunks. Optionally, one could append a textual comment to the block chain file (right after the hash). The comment should be in UTF-8 encoding and similarly to the file, the comment should be divided into 20-byte chunks. However, the comment does not have to end with its hash. We then concatenate the file chunks, file hash and comment chunks into one array. All of the chunks must then be converted to Base58 format. Finally, a normal Bitcoin transaction has to be made, sending the smallest possible amount of bitcoins to each of the Bitcoin addresses in that array."*

And to take into account, that transactions are not encrypted.  Encrypted data can be placed into the transaction, though, but regardless this is not the case for the majority of the illicit data, if even any at all.

It took me 5 minutes to figure out how any of this could be done in the first place, and in my opinion, is common knowledge by now.  You can also assume, now, that there is a standard way to format said data, and this formatting is used by services to automate the process for users.  I'm making a comparison to any program that is able to interpret and display data, or to write data in a way that is interpretable by process.  There is a standard in which it operates, which is usually no secret unless it is completely propriety, which is not the case in this particular instance.  The process is 100% in the open, and ALL the data needed is contained in the blockchain.

What is this "investment" you speak of?
