We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in China,
we shall fight on the internet and exchanges,
we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our Bitcoin, whatever the cost may be,
we shall fight at the banks,
we shall fight at the ETF hearings,
we shall fight in the comment fields and in the tweets,
we shall fight in the subreddits;
we shall never surrender, and even if, which I do not for a moment believe, Bitcoin or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our Empire beyond the BU miners, armed and guarded by the Economic Majority, would carry on the struggle, until, in God’s good time, the New POW, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old.

If we change POW we will be offloading a lot of valuable hardware that can easily be used to "secure" a competing blockchain.

I have some idea what's going on. You're probably a lil' bit high... that is... high on bits.

How will the Chinese Gov run out of fiat?

Step 1. This post makes the front page and a lot of people learn about Bitcoin.
Step 2. Trump wins.
Step 3. Profit!

Maybe op sees it as an investment in Bitcoin awareness.

Can someone make a bot that allows a group of us to automatically pledge our vote for a specific design for "The Square Block?" This is Bitcoin after all! Also, this experiment Reddit has unleashed upon us has a lot in common with Bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-09-16 17:59:02
Yes! That's exactly what I was going for. We are gentlemen after all.
@_date: 2017-09-08 04:01:03
I know I know! I just wanted to see if adding some protective gear could help cause a different outcome. There was only one way to know for sure. I apologize in advance if it doesn't work out.
@_date: 2017-09-16 18:03:07
Close! One bit is made up of 100 Satoshi. One Bitcoin is 1,000,000 bits. I think it's safe to say that if we get 1 bit to equal $1, we've unquestionably won the game of creating new global financial system.

Good. That was also part of the plan.

The riot gear is working you guys!!!
@_date: 2017-09-16 18:00:30
HeyZeusChrist you are exactly right. I believe that 1 bit should equal $1 and I'm going to do my part to help make it happen. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 18:24:29
A long way for sure, and it won't be easy. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 04:43:39
That's the plan. Empirically speaking, we'll all know it was this post that made it happen. It's science.

You're very welcome smellycat121.

 All right! My first controversial post!
@_date: 2017-05-23 17:43:59
Thanks! My guess is that Bitcoin stays dominant. What percentage of that 100T do you think will be captured by Bitcoin? I have a hard time imagining how people wouldn't diversify to other cryptos with different properties, especially once the 1T mark is crossed. I also think that fiat will still be a thing, just competing along side many other forms of money.

Exactly this.^  They're also playboy, gambler, baller wannabes. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 20:20:13
A lot of people who like Bitcoin also like to gamble. They just won't admit it.
@_date: 2017-05-27 20:30:48
A lot of people are waiting to see if the wall continues and hoping to glean some insight. Keyword is "hoping." My strategy is to let the market market and trust in the motives supporting the tech to make Bitcoin prevail over any and all obstacles.

Thanks for the up votes. I'm honored to have them. I'll be back again with something even better in the not too distant future. r/bitcoin.

He comes from a long line of proud Hodlers. His father was a Hodler. His father's father was a Hodler. It's all they know, but they're damn good at it.

Also... to be technically correct, which we all know is the best kind of correct, Bender would most likely use a brain wallet. Still good though OP.
