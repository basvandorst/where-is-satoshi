Oh boy does this sound great!
Now I guess we need a much higher segwit adoption for this to be implemented, right? 
Or are there any other factors which need to be known/completed for this to work?

Silk road busted before the rally though. Just saying.

Did anyone else stumble upon when he said that litecoin wasn't a bcash competitor? He just stated that bcash is much better than litecoin and therefore it's more of a Bitcoin competitor...
Quite ironic since bcash is basically a shitty copy of litecoin. Like actually what.

There's nothing hypocritical about trying to get rich, while wanting better wealth distribution.
As long as you're ready to pay the taxes if you make it

Isn't what is being suggested just a use of the fee market? It's not like anyone's reporting to the government. It's Googles own policy that they want to stop phishing attempts, right?
What I see here is simply causing awareness, which is needed in a true free market. Bro.

There's a pretty new video, which even though I've been following for 4 years, really helped me get the basics down!
It's just over 20 minutes, here ya go

That's clearly not true. Buying ~700 btc in January 2013, was easy as pie on mtgox

Nope, as I said finding a block isn't some work you can keep saved. Not only is it pure chance, the work needed also changes after every block found, hence the name blockchain. If you want to know more in depth 3blue1brown has made a great video explaining bitcoin :)

It doesn't work like that. At any point when mining you have a chance to find a block. It all depends on the hashes per second and current difficulty. Of course your chance goes up slightly over time, but not much..
So if you'd resume mining on your old hardware, the chance to find a block is almost non existent. Also the reward now is 12.5 btc

Soo, you copied an article from December last year and portray it as news on your own site? Jesus if you want to make a news site, don't post carcasses...
That's not even mentioning the missing sources on the original article.....

That's with traditional computing though. Quantum computers are a completely different beast.

That wasn't his point though. He's confused about how FGND could set up a lightning node, with 2 channels, and not know about the timeout period.. Like me, I have no idea how to do it, but just from following I know that both parties need to be present to close a channel..

Just a correction to your point about the fees. There's no reason that minimum fee have to be 1sat/byte. It could easily be lower, it's just not needed right now

Yup! You get a 24 word recovery seed. And if you want you can put a password behind it, so even if thiefs get the seed, they can't get your Bitcoin. It's really super smart! 
@_date: 2017-05-10 19:47:42
Here it says, even though they get your seed, a passphrase on the seed will make it non usable without the password!
@_date: 2017-05-09 10:16:34
Nah, there's extra password protection of the seed. It's super smart really! You can enter with any password, but only the right one will have your Bitcoin. I think you are confusing the password with the pin. The device has the pin protection, which if forgotten you can recover everything with the seed. If you forget your password, everything is lost forever!

I just got a Trezor, and I was fearing it would be quite some work. I literally just bought it because so many people in here always say "get a hardware wallet", withouth doing much research on how it works..
I just set it up yesterday and it's one of the easiest things I've done in bitcoin! Spend 30 minutes reading the manual and pretty much anyone can do it. It feels so nice to finally have secured my bitcoin properly!
