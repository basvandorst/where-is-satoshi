opinions on this? users??
@_date: 2014-07-25 19:20:37


average person is someone who understand microsoft word.


but we are talking about stuff that people will be using ... they also use machine language code , processor specific opcodes and electron mechanics by your logic


ummmm, i dont think you get what I am saying. bitcoin is not the same level of abstraction that the linux kernel is on - most people never directly engage with the linux kernel ... the intention, and the hope is that most users of bitcoin will want to hold there own wallet, and will need to have space available for the blockchain (and have some sort of understanding of why its necessary)


Not at all, people need to be able to understand from a high level what is happening, what you are saying seems to be opposite that idea

If you can't explain microsoft word, then I think she is below the techincal exposure of the average person.
XML is not ubiquitous to the internet, its ubiquitous if you are a web developer... but its hardly something most web users interact with in order to use the web.
No they don't , but how is that applicable to bitcoin? Is bitcoin a linux kernel level abstraction of technology?? 
I fail to get how your examples are in accord with bitcoin.

Have you read ? I don't see much of that behavior here. Hope you wouldn't write off an entire idea based off of a certain community on the internet.
- also remember you do not need to be a miner to utilize everything bitcoin has to offer. This is akin to saying- "I won't use dollars because getting a brokerage account is to difficult and stock brokers have an insular complicated social circle".

Yea, I'm not here to debate either per se. Just curious as to why you have drawn the conclusions you've drawn.
I haven't seen what you've said - but not sure what the point of going out of your way to voice a descanting opinion of bitcoins especially if its only based on the actions of one community which is in no way geared towards newbies.

I understand that it is speculative, which I think is your main gripe - and all the problems that come along with speculative work - but this is bigger than that. It is someone putting there money where there mouth is...and maybe, just maybe there is a lobbyist who has the sway and connections to get a major retailer to accept bitcoins - maybe even a client they are already wooing or dealing with...might catch someone's eye.

I don't think your really reading everything I have typed.
A 


Only under the circumstance that a hacker is able to completely cripple the entire system - simply hacking one app will in no way hack the other. Making the applications separate means you must now be able to  gain access to the other application through the other which could defend against half of the intrusion attempts into an app. Secondarily because they are split up, the other app can be much more locked down and can potentially not even run on the same computer or user. *this is where I also added that the blockchain app could be run from an online service completely disconnecting the two*


not really. you can move the wallet when the application isn't running, but if you forget to move the wallet back, or somehow make a mistake things get interesting...this is in no way easy, appropriate or an acceptable method of maintaining numerous wallets. What if you and another person used the same username and computer (spouses lets say)


....not really. I want my wallet to be safe and secure. Unless I am actively sending money to someone my walletmanager has no need to be interacting with the block at all.


well that sounds like a limitation that wouldn't work here - let alone add complication to the application that at the end of the day is just as hackable as what we have now.


agreed, and two separate applications/services to manage these two tasks is the easiest safest method that keeps both of these applications easy to edit and program, and easily distributed to all platforms - in addition this keeps us from having to change the way the app interacts currently (still can use the IRC p2p method).

@_date: 2011-06-30 21:53:01
That just isnt true. People want bitcoins because of a certain real(or imagined) fitness that they will provide. It has nothing to do with how hard they are to get (as long as you feel everyone will not be able to get them easily). If we were constantly running out of bitcoins to buy - THEN difficulty in mining would affect prices. 
But at the present moment, you can buy all the bitcoins you want given a reasonable amount of money. How many you want will have no correlation to how difficult they are to mine (as it relates to the difficulty from last week or next week) 
@_date: 2011-06-08 19:20:48
marry me
@_date: 2011-07-07 16:49:21
thats actually true. But that doesn't work the other way around.
just because mining becomes more valuable as bitcoins becomes more valuable - says nothing about the value of bitcoin as more people mine or there yield based off of difficulty
@_date: 2011-06-09 19:18:14
Expound further on what you mean by Secondary Market?
The other question I have been trying to get a hold of - is what makes a mining pool better than any other. (Deepbit for instance) . I have heard api's and json callbacks...but is that it?

@_date: 2011-06-21 19:35:23
You should be in a pool unless you are pulling in 2 - 3 Ghashes and willing to wait. Probably 10 - 20Gh is the only knee-jerk solo mining figure at this point.

@_date: 2011-06-29 17:13:53
only problem I am seeing - is once difficulty drops, will people that couldn't return there hardware and couldn't sell because of the massive sell offs jump back in. Causing a constant roller coaster up and down up and down. 
When the 7xxx series comes out, and the 6xxx series drops in price, I doubt there will be much of a second hand market for the 5830s being sold now.

@_date: 2011-06-23 16:54:22
The only reason I maintain they be separate apps, is in closing the security concerns inherent in the p2p aspect of the blockchain interactions. 
Any client that deals with the blockchain will have to transmit its ip address and open ports. Right now this all happens over a freely viewable IRC channel. Instead of rewriting and complicating that interaction - let that happen in a separate application, allowing users to hold there walletmanager in a completely different (even offline) machine if desirable. 
This is much stronger security without relying on anyone else's foresight or trust. You know inherently that the two are not within any reasonable doubts connected or hackable *through one another*. [hackable if you leave them on the same machine and the machine gets compromised of course - but at least now there is an easy stopgap ]

What I need someone to explain to me is. If I move my wallet.dat and reopen bitcoin - what will happen?
Best way to encrypt wallet, and how this changes my usage pattern
@_date: 2011-06-23 15:39:18
I disagree strongly. For this to work, and bitcoins to hit critical mass these things need to be addressed. Human nature is not a threat to the bitcoin protoco; but is a major threat to the adoption and use of bitcoins as a whole. There is a distinction betwix: 
* bitcoin economy
* bitcoins the system ( block chain, and p2p distributed components - bread and butter ) 
* bitcoin client ( user level implementation and interaction point )
* bitcoin the protocol
* bitcoin as a concept of crypographic currency
some of them are not affected by human nature, I would argue the most important ones - however, are.
From my point of view, alot of what is going on in the bitcoin client need to be separated. 
There needs to be a bitcoin wallet app and a bitcoin block interaction app that handles finding new bitcoins sent to your address - and nigh should the two meet.
@_date: 2011-06-23 15:49:38
This is a donation worthy level of investigation here - bravo author and op. 
Does anyone feel the bitcoin client is doing to much - and in a hodge podge manner? 
There should be a **wallet management app:** that  encrypts and handles different bitcoin wallets. Provides a secure api for other approved apps to interact with wallets under its control, and provides warnings and notifications of money leaving wallets based on user settings. Can also provide temporary receiving addresses and notifications when certain limits are reached.
and a separate 
**block interaction app** - which relays information to the wallet manager about pertinent transactions to the *walletmanager*. This would also help with the concern that the block chain will become to large for everyday users to download - users will connect there *walletmanager* to an online / cloud based block interaction app... that would send any relevant info as a file that could be passively (without being directly connected)  digested by the wallet app.
@_date: 2011-06-23 16:02:31
If the blockchain client simply sent a user a file, that the wallet could digest.... If you want to send your wallet invalid data to digest - so be it - nothing would be valid anyway. 
@_date: 2011-06-07 17:19:41

@_date: 2011-06-30 16:49:38
well we haven't seen anything but a continuously rising amount of difficulty and participants. Don't let past performance stipulate future expectations. 
My scenario centers around miners not being able to return or sell there 5830's/ If you present a scenario in which they are able to sell them (to non-miners), than your talking about something else.
If as I have said, 5830's cant be sold, or are just sold to larger miners...then you will see a yo-yo effect as miners jump back in when the electricity cost fall. Wether, people throw up there hands in disgust is something a psychologist might be able to answer better. But over the long term, if enough people dont jump back in - it will feed on itself, causing people to say - 'look, no one is doing this anymore - lets go mine again'
@_date: 2011-06-29 21:56:36
thats not what I was saying. Better hardware will cause people with 5830's to not be able to sell them.
Causing them to have nothing better to do, than to flood the pools when the difficulty drops - causing a yo yo effect.
@_date: 2011-10-04 20:59:29
