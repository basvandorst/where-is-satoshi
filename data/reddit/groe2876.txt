I just learned that "Bitcoin was introduced in 2008 by a programmer or group of programmers under the name Satoshi Nakamoto."

There are a couple of indicators in this article that would suggest Satoshi is on the spectrum. Is that being discussed anywhere?

96.3% of people who quote statistics are lying 74.2% of the time, but nearly half that when the are speaking to someone of the same sex.

How about, if you worked at Gox just reply to this comment with what the hell happened? I don't think anyone wants to wait for an article or wants anyone else to translate what this employee says about the state of their money.

I would rather have just listened to Barry talk for 10 minutes, the hosts added nothing to this.

Hmm.. the article is flirting with an interesting idea but hasn't quite figured out how to take it home. In particular because it makes no mention of charity and the enormous role that it plays in bitcoin. Nor does it bring to light the obvious idea that it takes involvement at all levels for something like bitcoin to be successful and success is defined greatly depending on what you have invested in it. So, if you are fortunate enough to have 100k USD to invest in mining it stands to reason you are privileged but more so believe that your 100k will be returned to you in the production of something that is going to help a lot of people who are probably not as fortunate. As a result the bigger idea is that people with the means to invest in a lot of things are choosing bitcoin for a reason, and that reason is not simply to help their rich friends as there is simply not enough other rich people to make the ROI positive.
