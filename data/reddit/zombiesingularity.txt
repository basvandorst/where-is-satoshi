Pretty sure the value of bitcoin has fallen more than the dollar.

They probably meant that gambling itself is a $3T business.

You realize the point of such a conference would be to increase wealth, right?

Nobody is "starving" in the DPRK. People say this all the time but they are referring to the 1990s famine, following the end of the USSR and the sudden cutoff of almost all of the DPRK's trade. People haven't "starved" in the DPRK for decades, even experts acknowledge this fact. Stop spreading bullshit.

Malnutrition is not the same thing as literal starvation, nowhere close. Malnutrition levels are higher in India, in fact.

Only if you assume that there are absolutely no exceptions to the NAP. If your child or loved one was going to jump off a bridge, would you not use force to protect them in that moment? Would this really be an impermissible violation of a person's rights? I think that most reasonable libertarians would say that it is perfectly reasonable to use force to help people in certain extreme circumstances.
In a similar light you have people who are mentally unhealthy, or physically disabled, incredibly unlucky, etc, who cannot afford basic healthcare or other lifesaving healthcare. Would it really be an impermissible violation of your rights to use force to take a very small percentage of your paycheck to help these needy people who cannot help themselves, to cover what charity cannot?
Sometimes it's justifiable to use force if the outcome is a net decrease in harm and suffering. This does not contradict libertarian principles at all, it's just a more nuanced form that would disagree with extremist anarchist versions of it.

People who slip into deep comas for years and eventually come out of it would beg to differ.

The users aren't fraudulent, but if their account is hijacked they stand to lose thousands instantly, and the news would make coinbase look bad even if it's not their fault. These transactions are irreversible, remember.

Just tumble your winnings, then send to Coinbase.

If you turn off a computer is it dead forever? Is the data on an hdd irreversibly lost if the data is erased? There's good enough reason to believe that death is theoretically reversible, given more advanced technology and scientific understanding decades (centuries?) from now.

Store it in Coinbase wallet vault. They're insured.

What this guy is doing is on par or worse than the NSA's actions, because this guy is publicly releasing people's nude photos. Pretty despicable...

He's somewhat socially libertarian, however. He was against the infamous "soda ban" in NYC, for instance. He's quoted as saying, "you shouldn't need to get permission from the municipal government to drink a soda" (something like that). On economic issues, however, he's very much a "progressive" liberal.
@_date: 2014-01-06 03:30:38
Well, at least he worked for it.

It almost did. It peaked in the ~$40's.

The people there don't want a fucking "armed revolution" sponsored by the CIA, you idiot.

I meant as far as the notion of a "global currency" is concerned, in terms of widespread use.

Bitcoin won't ever be anything more than a black market currency.

How does this work exactly? You get money via bitcoin then you just order someone a pizza with your credit card or what?

That already happens and they still make enough money to stay in business.

There's no comparison because what is being "stolen" is infinitely replicated for free. It would be like saying I "stole" a work of art if I scanned it and printed a copy of it, and then shared my copy with others to print as they feel free. That's not theft. Nothing is being taken, it's being replicated and shared, with the original left intact.

Name one show that was cancelled because it was pirated too much. Good luck.


Clearly you haven't been paying attention. There are *tons* of really out of the box movies that are made.


In the case of piracy, there isn't even a victim, so your analogy falls flat immediately. It is not a violation of your rights to make a copy of art you made, as long as I am not claiming it's my own work, or profiting from it directly. It's not that they can merely survive the horrors of having their ideas spread around freely, it's that it's not even a violation of their rights to begin with. 
You can own an idea only insofar as you can claim it as your own and only you can profit from that idea, but you should absolutely not be able to claim ownership to prevent the free expression and sharing of that idea. If it's acceptable for a public library to freely lend out books and movies, why the hell isn't it okay if a digital library with unlimited copies does the exact same thing?

They are not stealing anything, because they are not claiming it's their property. They are *sharing* intellectual "property", big difference. A non-gain is a not a loss.
