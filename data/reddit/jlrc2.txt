Well thanks for being honest.

It's the fact that most people don't know that they've been opted into non-intrusive ads nor that the people opting them into it were paid to do so. That's my beef.

This will just be another push towards Bitcoin being perceived as a thing weird people are into. I'd rather see non-crazy people endorse Bitcoin.

Probably not the best sign that a bowl game can generate so much more interest than the baseline. Better than nothing, of course

I do this on my personal website as well. I often tell my readers, however sparse they may be, how to block ads and other things as a means to preserve privacy. Of course, my only chance to pay for the costs of running the site is the ad revenue - I just ask that if they block the ads, consider donating.

Tips per user is the way you want to measure this.

Opt-out instead of opt-in is a big deal to me. People are inertial. Many others are inept. Making the pay-to-play ads a *default* is a deal-breaker to me because it's contrary to the mission of free and open source. Making it just an option that one can choose after the fact is fine. There is a lot of research about the effects of opting in vs. opting out and it's more than just "a choice" as the choice of default option likely defines what the majority of users will use.
While there are reasonable qualms about the effects of blocking ads, being borderline dishonest to make some show by accepting payments on free and open source software is hardly the way to fix that problem.

I understand that this sucks, but BTC transactions appear in a public ledger. It really isn't super difficult to track someone's transactions once they reveal their identity to you. If Coinbase wants to operate legally in most countries, they are required to do due diligence to snuff out illegal activity. Hopefully, they just start doing it better.

It's no different than if cash was stolen, though I'm this case there may be even better records leading to the thief.
