Crypto will open the average guy into seeing how much these old fucks are fucking us for, and where that money getting used...
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:55:35
Didn't say everyone did it? How about you shut up, and not try telling people to shut up. You noob
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:05:01
The amount of expert noobs out now Is amazing!
@_date: 2017-02-14 02:30:10
would be pretty stupid to be part of the btc comunity and assume what people have and dont have. your not the only one with a mystery wallet lol
@_date: 2017-02-05 08:25:06
you have taught me a valuable lesson tonight sir, thank you
@_date: 2017-02-11 21:39:39
Is jaxx any good? The nane keeps throwing me off lol
@_date: 2017-02-04 05:02:44
just keep buying and have faith. We should not consider this high but only in its infant stage. i feel mbtc will simplify this issue

@_date: 2017-03-08 21:33:08
same here, no confirmations, it has been 24hrs.
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:16:56
why dont you wait for the correction, smart people buy when they see reds.....how many times are you going to watch it go down, then watch it go up
@_date: 2017-01-30 03:17:08
seems like to me all people have to do is buy a bitcoin, and then all your time writing this woulda been useless. lol btw there are fairly large groups other than mexicans who already are getting aware of bitcoins. you visit them everyday and usually give them money. hint (gas, cigarettes, drinks, condoms, etc) good luck tho
@_date: 2019-08-11 06:08:49
Yuh, great isnt it? You would think people would be happy, but over leveraged longs are cryin like babies....when they could just flip short with some ballz
@_date: 2019-08-11 00:58:36
Take profits here atleast before we enter the 8k region....
@_date: 2019-08-10 23:39:35
The drop is now, and down we will go to test bullish areas of interest.
New highs come after we test high 7s to low 8s.
Take for what you want.

seems like 900ish might be the new norm, too much news coming out keeping it at that price, unless trump is impeached or something. 1k might be the base platform for growth from there
@_date: 2019-08-11 00:10:07
Yea, nothing wrong in making more Btc. You do you tho.
@_date: 2019-08-11 03:29:28

@_date: 2019-08-11 03:07:50
New to this whole social media stuff... wanted to see how having followers felt like.... its lonely being Bruce Wayne's equivalent in my area of the world. ��
@_date: 2019-08-11 01:06:16
That or grow your bag and keep hodling as per ones strategy may it be long or shirt term....
Its the same risk either way. As long as your risk is Defined, and you stick to your derisking protocols. Youll be fine.
Not everyone has the same risk appetites or mental capacity to derisk themselves when its smacking them in the face when to do so based on their own "personal strategy"..... that's life....

@_date: 2019-08-11 03:27:49
Yeh, whatever makes you sleep at night... taking a trade once every 2-3months is what i do... 
Excuse me if my risk appetite offends you.
The risk to reward ratio seems to good for me on this trade....thats just me tho...
@_date: 2019-08-11 00:44:57
Tbh i dont think so, everyone who follows this will be that much more wealthier in their btc stack....
@_date: 2019-08-13 16:19:32

@_date: 2019-08-11 01:32:35
