Weather you guys like it or not, this market is slowly changing from kickstarter's with coins to something closer to the DOW and NAZDAQ. This is made apparent by the owner of Overstock and his attempt to make a fully SEC regulated system. If you are in this game for the short term that means that you have and always will try to get away without paying your taxes. However, all governments are currently working on AI algorithims that are going to find you and catch you through use of trolling your Reddit, Facebook, Instagrams, how much you have ever deposited into a bank, withdrawls, what you have Googled.... People who didn't understand that this is a pump and dump and that people are going to get back into Bitcoin to get these upcoming 6 forks lost a lot of money because they didn't have the dicipline to hold on. All you dreamers out there who want a $100,000 Bitcoin or higher can't have that dream if this new money doesn't feel somewhat safe! The owner of Coinbase was extremely off telling when just a week ago he stated that he wasn't sure if they were going to carry Bitcoin Cash on their exchange and that he can only guarantee that people could withdrawl in on Jan 1. Not only will this be known as one of the greatest cases of insider trading in history but it caused issues in 2 markets, crypto and now the futures. So, if you didn't know long before this regulation is coming! And if you were one of those people who bought at 20K and didn't have dicipline and lost everything by selling at 15,900 you should sue Coinbase for insider trading!!!
