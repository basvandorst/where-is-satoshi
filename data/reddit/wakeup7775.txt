what exchanges honor the upcoming bitcoin fork?
i've heard binance will do it. what about coinbase does it matter what exchange it's in?
and what exactly happens at the bitcoin fork? i just know it'll give me 1:1 whatever amount of bitcoin i have and that it creates a brand new coin.

Nice yeah that's important to know about locking in the price at the time of the deposit.
I've heard about the concepts of wallets and it sounds like it's time to invest in one. Is the transfer process from wallet back to an exchange pretty painless? Thank you for your post.

What's the benefit of owning multiple bitcoins (or fractions of a bitcoin) rather than one. You're awesome thank you for your posts.

Withdrawing bitcoin to fiat. Another poster recommended buying and withdrawing from GDAX. Thank you for your post and advice.

Wow thanks for this advice. So GDAX basically works the same as coinbase? It's like binance except I can buy bitcoin directly from there?
I think the reason my wires (from fiat to coinbase) might take long is because I'm using coinbase. Sounds like GDAX is faster? Thank you for your response.
