As a hobbyist riddle-solver I think this would be a great idea! Would happily join in on the fun.

I'd tell you but then I'd have a target on my back. ;)

Gotcha. Which exchange do you use? I'm currently on Gemini, but the lack of autobuy is a bit of a put-off.

I see. I'm curious why you do one buy a week, rather than split it up into one a day since the market can fluctuate greatly in less than 24 hours. Would you ever put in a purchase on a "non-buy day?"

I use Mycelium as my wallet currently. I feel like once I reach 1 BTC I'll look into something like trezor or ledger. Also currently buying from Gemini and moving my coins directly to my wallet after.
Keys are backed up and written down in two different locations.

Absolutely! Traveling was one of the highlights of my life thus far.

Do you ever purchase more for a dip? I normally buy a fixed amount every day, but if it's dipping I'll usually buy more.

I'm still a bit confused as to what it really means if ETF is approved as well as the implications for the price of bitcoin.

Ahh. I used to use coinbase, but the fees just seemed unreasonable.

How would you compare bitsquare to bitstamp?

Thank you. I feel even though I've been doing my research there's still a lot to wrap my head around in order to have a total understanding of the system.
