You're an idiot.

Man, the Fed's propaganda was strong.  I can't believe you believe that.

You’re delusional.  People aren’t able to all of a sudden afford these rediculous prices again.  The economy may have grown but wages have not.  A simple google search will find you many articles about deteriorating loan standards and even the reintroduction of zero down and sub prime (sorry, non prime) mortgages.

It's not going to pop.  The fed is hoping to get double digit inflation.  This will effectively be a debt jubilee, allowing them to eventually reset rates to historical norms (once all the outstanding debt is mostly worthless).  The only people about to get rekt are savers and wage earners.

There's so much nonsense in your original post it's hard to know where to begin -- but I'll try:


This is a false dichotomy.  It's not one or the other.  Why can't I have a strong dollar and a bunch of goods that are now available thanks to scientific progress?


Where's this mythical savings account paying 3%?  If one exists, I bet it has lots of requirements and restrictions (e.g. 3% on the first 5k!)  Further more, latest inflation numbers came in at 3.1%yoy, and you still need to pay income tax on whatever interest you earn.


God, so much derp-a-derp in the above.  First, investing in stocks is entirely different than storing value in sound money.  Sound money should keep pace with inflation in a risk-free way.  Investing in stocks should beat inflation but your investments carry risk.  Why are you even comparing the two?  Furthermore, there was no easy way to simply "Buy the S&amp;P 500" in 1910.  Index funds didn't exist nor are they trivial to build.  Also, you're assuming that had you managed to build an equivalent index fund that you wouldn't have been wiped out in, say, the crash of 1929.  It's easy to say "I wouldn't have sold" except for the fact that you probably would have had to so you could eat.


There's a difference between investing and saving.  They both serve totally different economic functions.  In fact, I believe common wisdom encourages having 6months living expenses *saved* before you begin to invest.  Without sound money, those living expenses will lose value year after year.
You clearly have no real grasp of economics or inflation.  You're just parroting would logical fallacy after the next.  Stay in highschool, kid.

Sure, interest rates will rise but always remain just below inflation .

Steve tried to paint himself a pretty picture — an engineer who doesn’t need or care about the money.  It’s all bullshit though.  He sold at the top and no longer promotes bitcoin.

Stopped listening to him as soon as he said Trezor provided security but not trust or privacy.
His reasoning was if you use the trezor web ui interface that they “control your transactions and spy on you”.
First of all, Trezor is fully compatible with electrum.
Second of all, the web ui isn’t phoning home.
Thirdly, all their source is open... so see for yourself.

QE isn't debt.  It's literally printed money.  The Fed is under no obligation to un-print that money.

I just made over 600$ selling my bitcoin fork coins.  200 from bgold, 180 from diamond, 50 from private, 40 from superbitcoin, and the rest from bifi bcx and one other I forget the name.  Unbelievable people are buying this trash.
@_date: 2018-07-30 17:48:32


No, it doesn't and no, it doesn't.  The fed targets 2% inflation per year -- the money supply is continuously increases and there's no plan to ever decrease it.  Money created by the fed is not debt.


Again, QE isn't anything that needs to be paid back.  Also, the fed controls interest rates.  They control the short and and, via QE, the long end.  The fed can keep interest rates as low as they want for as long as they want.  They may choose to voluntarily raise those rates should inflation be too high for them.


Again, the fed controls interest rates.  They buy whatever bonds they want via QE.


Japan has been doing QE for over 2 decades now.  No signs on stopping.

They of course fixed it.  They put interest rates below the rate of inflation.  All the bad debt that is created is steadily inflated away at the expense of savers and those working for a wage.  The real question is: when will people start to care?

1. Anyone can run their own liquid sidechain and issue assets. Conceptually this is no different than the hundreds of different exchanges world wide trading stocks, bonds, options, etc
2. It says right there in the summary: trustless transactions with no h trusted third party.
