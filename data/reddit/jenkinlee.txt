We have waited approximately 4600000000 years to get this far.  If you want the cheap transactions that lightening and all the new things will provide you may have to wait another 6-12 months. In the mean time please be patient. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:02:37
Still a few hours to go before the main net release :-) 
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:53:14
How long usually before they are returned to the sending address if the fee is very low for example?
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:30:52
I suspect that Roger is one of the most hated guys in crypto. I really don't know how he has the nerve to appear in public. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 10:41:08
Any suggestions on applications / software to use for calculating capital gains?
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:47:01
What does this mean for RSK? 
@_date: 2017-12-28 11:25:51
I'm still hoping for a list of wallets that are behind the times and do not support SegWit.  Let's shame them into action.
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:32:15
You sound like the guy who said the internet would never replace the fax machine. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:36:43
I have been waiting 18 months for this day.  Sidechains with Smart Contract capabilities for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:38:44
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:01:57
Incorrect.  The main net release is December 4th which is today. It's being announced at the laBITconf conference hopefully in the next few hours. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 05:45:56
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:41:46
Could you add details on the wallets that are not SegWit capable. It will provide a reminder to them and everyone else that they are behind the times and should perhaps not be used. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:37:18
and uses that money to pay people to like him.  What a pathetic individual.  
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:47:31
If they had spent time researching bitcoin they would not be the "average Joe" any more. I recall the same thing months ago when a bunch of guys were saying it was around $4,000 and going to crash.  
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:12:39
Have you forgotten to suggest it may be a good idea for exchanges to implement SegWit or more likely I assume this is a sock puppet post with some heave post up votes being paid for.  Good luck with the sock puppet post.  You're fooling nobody here. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 06:37:37


From Sergios comments it would appear that miner was not using the RSK reference client which he says has been tested for over a year on testnet.
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:52:09
It wouldn't surprise me for this post to be the target of paid "down votes" by the Roger Ver PR team and before you reply saying "no such thing" don't bother as I think there's no single true poster here who doesn't believe such a thing exists.
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:45:06
how about changeably.com?
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:20:32
Been a few weeks but when I was selling my BCash I saw blocks with just 54 transactions in them.  
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:25:14
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:20:32
I will be quite happy if Roger does abandon BTC.  He's welcome to his  bcrash.  Nobody wants him around
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:14:33


Thanks for clarifying my question.  Can you explain what a market limit order is?  Say for example I want to sell 1 bitcoin tonight at whatever rate.  Can I do this with a market limit order?  How about if I say I want to sell 1 bitcoin if the value goes above $10,000?  
@_date: 2017-11-09 11:27:54
Sorry but you won't have much success with the "Isn't a bad guy" here.  People here learned a lot about the good and bad guys over the last six months. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:23:44
Haha yeah right.  With almost 1000% gains in the last 12 months I have yet to find one friend of mine that's upset with fees that they might get when using bitcoin to purchase a cup of coffee.  
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:11:25
Your friend is probably very naive, rather stupid or he gets a commission on you joining.  Pick one of the three.  If you want to have a chance of making money on the price of bitcoin rising then buy a bitcoin (or fraction of) from a legit exchange like the rest of us. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:20:31
Because Roger Ver is funding so many sock puppets to post about BCH and hoping that will push up the price of the coin that he likes to think he's in control of.   
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:54:18
Someone should translate this into Korean and Chinese for our friends over there who are losing all their money. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 06:17:46
As I am pretty sure you are aware. There is no "not invented here" syndrome with the few hundred core developers. Each idea is considered on its own merit and to ensure the stability of bitcoin some ideas are considered and carefully researched for years. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:27:52
use changelly.com
@_date: 2017-11-09 04:06:49
Sounds like Erik Voorhees‏ is a little bit pissed off about his failure to take over control of bitcoin.  I wonder what he's planning next.  Takeover of Bitcoin Cash :-)  If that's the case I'm pretty sure he's welcome to have it all for himself. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 10:39:17
We don't hear Coinbase or most of the miners showing any concern at all.  They seem to enjoy the whole situation.
@_date: 2017-10-03 06:51:50
How did you get rid of it / exchange it / sell it?
@_date: 2017-10-11 10:10:30
Because he's an idiot, a con artist and a person who has been proved to lie more times than I can count. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 12:36:22
He used to be very supportive of the developers but now he's heading in the same direction as Jihan and seems more interested in making quick money rather than in the long term future of Bitcoin.

Wow you're a friendly character
@_date: 2017-10-09 11:28:24
Thanks, actually it's not so much ill gotten gains as a concern that a person I send some bitcoin (or cash) to would be able to sit there and work back to find out all the addresses
@_date: 2017-10-02 04:10:25
Jeff's been watching the way Roger cries for attention and has started the same thing.  He figures if he lies often enough then people will start to believe him.  But people are not that stupid and with every new lie he just makes himself look more of an idiot. Shame to see people like him involved with bitcoin these days. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 09:35:50
1,000 times more qualified than the used car salesman con artist who's telling people he's Bitcoin Jesus. What a shame to have that ex-felon who's trying to take control of bitcoin trying to represent himself as Jesus.

Why would anyone support Open Bazaar when the founder is all for the breakup and centralization of bitcoin:
@_date: 2017-10-26 11:20:17
Very good to hear this but I wonder when exactly is "soon"?

Unfortunately I cannot run my own node as my internet speeds are very poor. From a personal security point of view I use a Trezor.  Would it still be more secure to have my own node? What security advantages would it bring?
@_date: 2017-10-02 08:04:09
I want to sell my bcash and buy btc like probably EVERY SINGLE ONE of the others on this thread. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:51:38
BTCC is my guess 
@_date: 2017-10-01 13:57:38
He has broken apart the community and caused more problems than anyone else combined. Shame on him and his disgusting tricks and games.  He's a disgrace to the community and to the many hundreds of hard working developers.

Do you support NYA and what will you name the SegWit2x coin if the NYA guys decide to go ahead?

Because he's spent the last few years trying to attack the work of hundreds of dedicated people.  He's a true con-artist and a guy who's been caught out lying so many times over.

Reality is if 2X happens then 12 people in a room have been able to change the direction of bitcoin to meet corporate needs.  Nice try to fool as many people as possible but most here are not that stupid.  Don't make out it is a nothing event.
