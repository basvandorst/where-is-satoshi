I thought this was a book. Is there an audio book version?
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:40:24
I feel like most people will miss the reference.

Just curious in an bitcoin eBay type situation, If I pay someone and they don't see me the product what is my recourse?
I know things like Silk Road worked off feedback, but that means the population doesn't get screwed over, but some individuals do.

It's doing amazingly well, but that doesn't mean it isn't looking ground (even if only temporarily).

Why would be holding in Segwit vs legacy and not spending impact transaction fees? This seems like a misleading post.

How about when I posted about how to split out my bitcoin gold from my BTC stack so I could sell it. Why did that get banned? I know this sub has a focus but the automoderating is frustrating. Even when I explained to mods they refused to allow it.

Ahh my bad
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:39:22
Yes locked in. Unsure on the second question.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:11:42
Ahh the obvious answer. Thanks.

How did you get this screenshot? I got a message that coinbase prevents screenshots as a security mesasure

Thanks Andreas. Working through Mastering Bitcoin, but will pick up the audible when done.

Why even take the time to post this?
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:20:16
What's happening?
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:40:07
I think you're spot on. At this point, BTC replaces gold, not fiat.

His reply to someone saying it's a distasteful post with all his talk about how we should help the poor: "we make the world a better place through trade"
What does that even mean?
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:57:15
Haha you could help some new people out instead of laughing.

Unless there is a way to deal with spam, do we not need bigger blocks to prevent this attack vector?

Is this tether thing an issue or is it FUD?
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:08:53
A bank stores your money. Coinbase is a currency exchange. The fee structure is not comparable.
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:54:57
Why don't you look at the transaction in the blockchain? It's not a scam.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:36:48
They are waiting for your payment to clear. Not sure why it's so long, but you lock in a price when you buy so no worries on the wait time.

Ok, but I can go to a fancy neighborhood in any city, look at some big houses, look at public records for who owns the house and assume they have a hefty bank account.

I think he is talking about the cost to run miners not send funds.
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:40:35
I thought it would make sense to pay off a house ASAP then someone pointed out even an index fund on average pays more than than mortgage interest (which is also tax deductible). Did you consider this before selling and paying off the house?
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:42:58
This needs to be said more.
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:38:04
He said he sold everything. Nothing to hack.
@_date: 2017-11-18 14:24:49
It didn't break it on coinbase which a lot of people use as their price.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:20:38
We're not just here to take part, we're here to take over!

It amazes me that people treat bitcoin like a religion and not a revolutionary currency and protocol that it is. It's this attitude that leads to rationalization of anything bad into something good.

Ahh, thank you! I missed that in my config file. What is different about the two transactions that makes one show up without txindex set?
