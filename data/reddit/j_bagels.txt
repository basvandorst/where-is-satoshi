The fact that bitcoin's USD price dropped a few thousand has people running for the hills after it tripled in 6 months makes me cringe.

I HODL because I believe bitcoin will help me own a home within my 20’s, something I never thought would be possible.

Can you repeat the question?

As others have said, keep a spreadsheet of purchase date and price paid. 
The only thing that is taxable is your gain because the USA observes crypto as a capital asset. So if you bought at $1,000 and sold for $1,500 your taxable amount is $500.
consider how long you’ve held onto them when selling. All gains that were held for more than one year are taxed at a lower rate than if you sell within one year. 
(Assuming all your bitcoin has been held for over a year) Choose a cost basis (price paid) method strategically. Depending on how much you sell it might be more beneficial to report your most recent bitcoin bought vs the earliest amount you bought. (First in first out vs. Last in first out.) whatever method you choose, keep it consistent year to year or that adds risk for audit.
Hope this helps.

First rule of investing is only invest what you can afford to lose. Do your own research and form the conclusion if you want to even set an emergency sell point.
I believe in the tech behind bitcoin and believe it will be a large part of our future so I’m holding long term regardless of the roller coaster.
