The guy who started closing bank accounts related to Bitcoin in Australia is the guy who is in charge of the "think group" or whatever it's called advising the government on bitcoin policy. Don't get too excited.

Great, the banks who have been closing accounts for companies that accept Bitcoin are now calling the shots in terms of Australian bitcoin policy. Don't expect this to be a good thing.

6 months ago I would have said that's a wild conspiracy theory. But then I saw a post called "Bitcoin and Mallory" and dug a little deeper and I completely agree with you, there's some fu*kery going on here.  This has nothing to do about the block size. Satoshi himself said bigger blocks will be needed and that's not what the email is arguing against. This is all about the consensus model.
@_date: 2015-08-18 13:35:26
Can you be more specific?
@_date: 2015-08-18 13:19:24
I think he wants the block size to increase, but that's entirely beside the point. The point is the consensus model.
@_date: 2015-08-18 11:02:23
If I were him, I would *not* sign it. Signing it means that bitcoin *needed* a leader and the community itself could not resolve it without one, but the whole idea is that it *cannot* need a leader, it *must* be consensus or the *whole thing* is moot. If he needs to sign it, it's exactly the same as what he fears - loss of the consensus process - so he *can't* sign it. In other words, if he has to sign it, bitcoin is equally a failure.
@_date: 2015-08-18 10:48:05


If that's true, it doesn't matter who said it, it *is* a failure.
@_date: 2015-08-18 13:17:32
Or he just believes in a consensus model. Which he does. If he has to verify it then bitcoin has failed in his purpose for it.
@_date: 2015-08-24 23:09:02


But what does the fox say?
@_date: 2015-08-18 13:37:36
That's exactly the point. If he has to post proof that it's him, then the consensus model (and bitcoin) has failed. Argument from authority should have no influence over any decisions, that is incompatible with the entire reason for starting bitcoin. There *must* be questions about the email's authenticity in order for it to be in-line with the entire reason for writing it. That brings in the question of why he used his name at all, and I suspect simply because that's the only way for it to get widespread attention and this is a life and death situation for bitcoin (if it breaks the consensus model as the email suggests it will).
@_date: 2015-08-19 01:06:00
It's more about who decides the percentage and how, and why a consensus amongst the core couldn't be reached. I don't have enough understanding of the situation to know what percentage is right (I don't think many of us do).
@_date: 2015-08-18 13:23:25
No, he absolutely would *not* sign it if it was him. That would defeat the purpose of the consensus model.
@_date: 2015-08-18 13:21:22
I think you misunderstood the fork issue and where the "75%" figure comes from.
@_date: 2015-08-18 13:45:04
Exactly. He's arguing about the consensus model, the block size is irrelevant to the discussion.
@_date: 2015-08-18 13:32:43
If he has to sign it then it means the consensus model (which is what this is really about) has failed. Signing the message is exactly the same as going through with the fork.
@_date: 2015-08-18 10:40:24
Most likely a coincidence but this sounds exactly how Pieter Hintjens writes and has an identical philosophy behind it as is in his book Culture and Empire. 
@_date: 2015-08-19 01:21:29
He's talking about consensus amongst developers, not amongst the nodes. There's not even a consensus that 75% is the right number, the two developers just arbitrarily created that number. If the fork is successful, those two developers can then change the actual consensus model used by the nodes with no oversight from the others, and the barrier to doing another fork is very high (in other words, it's easy to put these two developers 'in power' but hard to get them out, a recipe for disaster).

The real SN is far too intelligent to be fooled by something like that. And why would he need to come out? To prove Craig wrong? What for? Who cares if Craig is SN or not, it makes no difference. If one person or group can hijack the community then the Bitcoin experiment is a failure, whether that person's name is Gavin, Craig, or Satoshi makes no difference. If it needs 'leadership' then it is a failure. If it needs SN to come out and 'prove Craig wrong' then it is a failure.
@_date: 2016-05-03 03:10:36
Whoever Satoshi is, he has a completely different motivation to this attention seeking idiot.
@_date: 2016-05-03 03:17:18
Or Gavin has an agenda.
@_date: 2016-05-03 03:22:22
You also can't prove that there isn't a flying unicorn in orbit around mars. I claim it to be true, now prove me wrong.
@_date: 2016-05-03 04:14:30
Perhaps something more sophisticated but yeah, this has something to do with bankers/psychopaths. When there's money on the table, the wolves come out biting. Happens *every* time without fail. The wolves *are* biting and ripping at Bitcoin, it's impossible for them to *not* do it, because there's money on the table. The question is, has the community identified the wolves, or do some remain hidden in plain sight?

I am Gavin. I saw him sign it in front of me. He doesn't want me to say any personal information about him or anything though, he doesn't want to make this into a big deal, that's why he went to all the news outlets multiple times and begged for attention. Just a private guy who wants privacy. Neither of us have any ulterior motives here, yeah I know there's a shitton of money on the table that packs of wolves fighting over but that's not what this is about, it's really just about a guy who wants to live his own private life and doesn't want to offer any public evidence, but I verified it's him in secret and you can trust me because I have no other motivations to do this whatsoever.
@_date: 2016-05-03 04:21:51
Only people with something to hide need to dance around in dark corners like this. Gavin could be in on the whole thing for all we know, there's a LOT of money on the table.
