I stopped in to check it out last night also but I had read other users experiences so I knew roughly what the process was like going into it. Minor complaints:
1. It wasn't immediately clear where to insert your ID.
2. My wife is 4'11" so she had to stand way back in order get her head in the frame of the camera while I clicked "next" for her.
3. If you generate a paper wallet it doesn't print out the public address as a QR code. 
Other than that it was a relatively painless process. Sure, it's not instant like traditional ATMs but it is the easiest and fastest method I've ever used to obtain bitcoin. 
End result: my non-tech wife bought her first bitcoin last night.

Based on his recent rise in popularity I would guess he's reaching more ppl than he turns away. If he were to tone down his speeches then he risks losing what sets him apart. I get that some ppl dont dig the zealotry but by watering down the powerful speeches in attempt to appeal to a broader audience he runs the risk marginalizing himself. 
I think the very fact that this is something that's being discussed if proof of his effectiveness.

Amway? Are you fucking serious?
His passion makes him come off strong but many of us are glad to see a powerful voice.

Seems like he reaches more ppl than he puts off.

I read up until "Amway" before I choked on my Kool-aid.

Sure, I get that but you have to build up your support base first, right? That being said, it will be interesting to see the reaction from outside "the congregation".

I've been running a Statoshi node for a few weeks now and hit 75 connections earlier today. My geek pride swelled.

When did they start accepting? Are they listed on Coinmap? I was looking for restaurants that accept btc back in Nov and there were very few.

I'd love to see this in League of Legends. Not only would it help keep trolls at bay, but you could tip helpful or honorable players. Being able to purchase champs and skins with Bitcoin would be nice too.

I am an outspoken atheist and bitcoin fanboy and I approve of this message.

Very nice. What would you estimate the final retail cost to be?
