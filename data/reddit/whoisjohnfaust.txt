So, I have an odd story.  I have had a walle ever since Jeffery Tucker convinced me to get one when I was trying to crowdsource my ticket to the International Students For Liberty Convention.  He put the word out and I was actually able to raise the money I needed.  That said, people talked about how I would get bitcoin and even Jeffery said he would send me some.  That said, I never received any which tells me I did something wrong.  I am not trying to get free coins, I am trying to figure out if I am doing this right.  I heard that there is a fraction of a fraction of a penny unit, I just want someone to send me one of those to know that I am doing this correctly.  To my understanding, I give the wallet number  14MwMapmUEq3rZ6B8gHrTeeCQfknfveyKQ again and it should work.  If it doesn't, what should I do?  I have the wallet through blockchain.  You can verify the story in my post history.  I appreciate the help.  I am excited to learn and use bitcoin in life to get a bit more "off the grid".

I have a second question, who mints the physical bitcoins and how would they work.  I get that you buy these coins from whoever mints them, but now what.  I would assume they are minted by anyone who decided to and that would mean that they are artificially inflatable since they are outside the system.  I am sure I am wrong, but I don't know why I am wrong.

I am starting a Bitcoin/crypto podcast.  Can I use that on our site?  With attribution, of course.

I figure I should include some background.
So, the podcast is my brother and I talking about crypto to each other and interviewing cool people.  He works as the audio visual/whatever you need guy at the Stanford Engineering Quad.  So he gets to hang out and chat with a lot of the speakers there and has built an impressive little network of crypo entrepreneurs.  
I work at Google as an analyst (the very bottom of the Google totem pole), but I did a lot of work for free market think tanks, so my crypto friends tend to be economists and political philosophers.  Together, we are giant nerds that have a love of blockchain technology and crypto.
We aren't experts or engineers, just fans and believers that blockchain technology will change the world.

We have 1 episode ready.  Once we have 3 we will start dropping content.  The Cryptomaniacs Podcast is the name.  I have been a crypto fan since 2013.

I am super new to this and I am just trying to learn.  I am interested in bitcoin, but this makes it seem like if you didn't mine the coin, it isn't safe.

I am in Idaho so, anything I get will have to be shipped either way.
