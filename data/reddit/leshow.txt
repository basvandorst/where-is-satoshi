the higher the network propagation in an unconfirmed transaction the more likely it is to be included in the next block, it takes less than 30 seconds usually for the network propagation to reach a point such that you can be 90+ percent sure it will be in the next block. bitpay and coinbase already use this method to make transactions near-instant i believe. 
for the fast majority of transactions that's sufficient. for transactions where someone might actually attempt a double spending attack (thousands upon thousands of dollars). both parties might decide it's worth it to wait 10 minutes for a confirmation.

actually none of those are necessary. for bitcoins to be valueless people just need to stop thinking they have any value.
you have overthought this to all hell. nobody is saying bitcoin doesn't have some good qualities about it. but your argument was that it can't have a zero dollar value, is completely untrue, and i felt i had to point that out. 
whether you get warm fuzzies over some other innovation of bitcoin you feel is intrinsically valuable is irrelevant to that point. it can have a zero dollar value if people stop paying for them.

No, that's just plain wrong. you can generate an infinite number of addresses and they won't appear in the blockchain until they have a balance.


of course you can. you can generate addresses offline, those addresses will not be in the blockchain, you can send bitcoins to them, then the address will be in the blockchain with a balance.
you shouldn't be giving anyone advice.

@_date: 2014-02-28 21:18:40
how can you tell that someone didnt get into your email?
if you had wallet backups sent there, they can be downloaded and cracked locally.
in fact, if you ever posted your wallet identifier, it can be cracked locally fairly easily. unless you have a 30+ character password with significant entropy.
also if you reuse the same address (as many blockchain.info users do) you are vulnerable from theft from that address because it will naturally be in more wallet backups. when i used blockchain.info, i would move funds to new address and use change addresses, so even if older wallet backups were cracked, they'd be useless as i wasn't even using those private keys anymore.

@_date: 2014-03-20 15:49:38
the amount of addresses you've created but have never used are irrelevant, they don't show up in the blockchain.
it's very hard to know how many bitcoin users there are. many people use coinbase, which means their amounts will be lumped in together with others... same with those who only use exchanges. then there are those that use local wallets and will probably have used quite a few addresses. 
tl;dr: you can't gain much info on # of bitcoin users from addresses, not even as an upper limit

if bitcoin was the exact same as cash, it would lead to the same end conclusion which would be storage in banking institutions. this is the reason satoshi developed additional transaction types. these things make it possible to do things you can't do with cash.
p2sh, m of n transactions, voting, 'smart' contracts. how you can have funds trustlessly stored with a third party (not possible with cash). have a look at what trustedcoin is doing. that is not possible with cash.
these bitcoin banks are the earliest wave of entrepreneurs taking the existing financial system and projecting it onto bitcoin. IMO this will likely not be the direction bitcoin goes in as like you said, it makes it the same as cash. using bitcoins special properties can make it into something more. 
although i suppose you'd rather just take my comment on face value... but i'll say it again: bitcoin is very different from cash.

you're missing quite a bit.
1. you're supposed to use testnet for testing your system. 
2. i'm guessing that most of your transactions were to test that system as at today's exchange rate 50 dollars in btc or 0.1115 btc gives you 1115 transactions. over 1k transactions for 50 dollars is pretty damn good. i pay close to 50 dollars for a single bank transfer.
3. there's also the matter of you actually paying those credit card fees but just not realizing it. for example, the people you purchased from have to pay 2-3% to be able to accept your credit card, they are not going to eat that fee, so they increase the cost of their goods to cover it. even though you don't see the fee on your credit card, rest assured, you are still paying for it.

i didn't say it was 'evenly distributed' i said it was more fairly distributed than fiat. which is true. 


i'm a software engineer, so yes. read what i wrote. i didn't say it's ready for the masses now, i said that easier tools will likely be developed. if bitcoin is to succeed, they have to. if they aren't developed than bitcoin will fail. my point was that it's premature to call this one right now.


'making money off P2P' is a very vague statement. also, kind of a strawman argument.


you seem to have selected P2P users with extreme bias. i don't agree. 'P2P' is a very general term to begin with. many many companies employ some kind of peer to peer in their applications. besides just companies, much of the traffic on the web is also p2p. 


no. at least not to me. i think only the most hardcore bitcoiners want to abolish fiat money and run the world on btc. that's not practical. bitcoin will likely become integrated or provide alternatives in some way. i don't believe this is a complete revolution and banks are dead forever.

if you had 16 btc that wasn't one unspent output, but a huge number of unspent outputs (like an unspent 0.05 + 1.03 + 0.084884 + .... ) the fee should be something like 0.0001 btc per 45 kb. wallets like electrum i believe do this for you automatically, but if you manually entered the fee, you probably didn't take into account the real number of outputs you were spending.

it's not as bad as it sounds, the qt implementation allows spending from unconfirmed change addresses. 
for example, if i have a 20 btc input, and i spend 1 btc, 19 btc gets deposited to a change address (sent back to yourself). qt allows you to form another transaction using that output.
the second transaction wont get confirmed until the first is though, so even with the spam the solution is to simply wait for a confirmation on the change address

that's not taint analysis.
taint analysis would be if you transferred the coins say to another address you control, then again to the gambling site, and coinbase walked through your intermediate transactions to determine the destination transaction.
if you're transferring directly to the gambling site all they need to know is if the address you transfer to is in the gambling sites control

you obviously didn't read up on it like I suggested.
you can have 2 private keys. one on your hot computer, one backed up offline on a drive somewhere. if the company goes offline or loses their private key, you can take your secondary key (plus your hot one) to move the funds out.
do your research before you make conclusions. 
@_date: 2014-03-11 18:59:10
that doesn't cover all attack vectors.
if somebody hacks in and swaps the javascript out to send your seed elsewhere. then every seed they gather can empty the entire wallet balance.
i.e. it's open to the same attack vector as blockchain.info. though likely one less since it doesn't store encrypted wallet backups. 
@_date: 2014-05-23 14:33:06
having a bunch of nodes is great but it doesn't magically solve all the scalability problems bitcoin has. you still need all those transactions to get confirmed, and that's the job of miners.

you clearly don't understand the bitcoin protocol very well.
even if they did manage to trick everyone by pointing miners they said they would point elsewhere to themselves, they would also have to be malicious and very lucky.
having 51% doesn't mean no miners outside the pool will profit. it just means if they are also lucky (in generating the next 2-3 valid blocks) AND malicious they could use that to initiate a double spend.
it doees NOT mean that all over pools stop profiting.

all these pathetic attempts to give mark a way out need to be seen for what they are. 'under a gag order' give me a break. he didnt have 750k stolen, that document was written by someone other than mark intending to put a spin on it. i wouldn't be surprised if mark told them to leak that document just so people might actually believe it.
all evidence points to that even if there were losses from malleability, it's nowhere near the amount mark is suggesting. no criminal investigation = no outside theft.
mark either lost the private keys or is a theif, and he is a fraudster in both scenarios. put his fat ass in jail.

Who says that it has to? Who says that the thing Bitcoin becomes used for is every individual holding their balance online?
It's equally possible IMO that Bitcoin ends up being used just as a transfer of value online and gets converted into fiat currencies instantly after being received. Maybe the end result will look sort of like Bitpay's model. 


It's worth pointing out that a company might come along and guarantee a certain dollar value for your bitcoin to prevent you from volatility. Coinapult does this for example with their 'locks' feature. You 'lock' in your bitcoin at a certain rate and Coinapult takes care of the fluctuation up or down.

i'm a software engineer, so i'm looking at it through that lens.
it's ethereum, not ethereal. although it's funny you use that word as it's definition is exactly what 'ethereum' will likely end up being: i.e. "lacking material substance" 
trying to implement a 'turing complete' programming language inside a blockchain on top of a financial system will never work. base systems need very simple instruction sets that can then be combined to do more complicated tasks. like assemby, simple instruction set, yet very powerful. bitcoin's limited scripting functions are also a great example of that. 
it's not "leading the way for bitcoin". bitcoin will never implement those features. the network would never accept it, and it's not needed. it would be more than a hard fork, it would be an entirely different network. to suggest that it would be implemented in btc is ridiculous.
listen, i know you watched a few videos and from a thousand mile high perspective it seems like a great idea. but i would caution you to blindly believe something is a good idea when there is no proof it actually works and no good examples of the source doing anything that they claim it's supposed to do.

then it should be accurate, and not your personal assumptions. 


this unintelligible comment makes me think you don't know what you're talking about. p.s. 'thermal dynamics' (it's called thermodynamics) has nothing to do with Bitcoin. 


i2p or tor doesn't make your transactions anonymous. it just adds an extra layer of privacy on which node you used to relay your transaction first. it doesn't add any anonymity to the transaction per se. Bitcoin is very much 'traceable'.


When did I say email wasn't prevalent? I said making a prediction that Bitcoin will become "as common if not more common than email" has absolutely nothing to do with the protocol and isn't at all based in fact, it's just your personal opinion.

Bitcoin is currently INFLATIONary. not deflationary. 'promotes a savings based economy and not a debt based one' is also your personal conjecture, and not part of Bitcoin per se. 


it's pseudonymous. and is probably the most traceable currency to ever exist. the blockchain is literally a public traceable ledger. mixing services are not a foolproof path to anonymity. 
 


this is your personal feeling, not part of Bitcoin. 
I couldn't even go through the rest of it. If I was trying to give a new bitcoin user information on Bitcoin, this is probably the LAST document I would ever give them.

that's very much doable on a good gpu setup. especially if you had reused the same addresses over and over. they got a hold of your encrypted wallet file and brute forced it. all of my bitcoin related passwords are 40 characters or more, that pretty much removes them from the realm of brute forcing. 
do you reuse your email or blockchain password anywhere? 
it's even possible someone could grab the wallet identifier from your cache, that's all you need to download a copy of the encrypted wallet. then you can brute force it from there.
this is one of the many reasons i switched to electrum. if blockchain was to be hacked one day, someone could add a few lines of javascript that sends your private keys as soon as the user logs in trivially. it is not a secure place to store funds. there are many attack vectors on the web.
i use electrum with the 12 word seed they provide. it has 128-bits of entropy if you use the provided seed, and you can use it from multiple computers by simply remembering the seed; it generates addresses deterministically.

no. the qt client lets you form transactions from change addresses, which can lead to permanently unconfirmed transactions.
this is different than "treating the transaction hash as an id"
the idea was that change addresses are safe to include in tx's because you are sending them back your yourself essentially. however due to the widespread DoS, this has been shown to not be a safe assumption.
it has nothing to do with tracking the tx hash only.

This encrypts your wallet. I did not know my wallet was unencrypted. I feel like this would have saved me. Do this by going to account settings &gt; Passwords &gt; then second password.
that's just plain wrong. the primary password encrypts your wallet, no blockchain.info wallet is store unencrypted. the second password is just an additional password.

Bitcoin may be the next progression afterwards. You or I really don't have the answer to this question. It either will or it won't. I've got my skin in the game to find out. Bitcoin isn't going backwards, it's going forwards. It takes the trust you had in the bank and breaks it up and distributes it over the whole network. Other currencies can't do that.

i think it's pretty clear that bitcoin is not ready for mass consumption yet. 
if you revert back to traditional banking models, you've effectively removed any possible benefit of using bitcoin and shouldn't be using it at all. 
however with p2sh you can split the trust between the an entity and yourself. they hold a private key that you have no knowledge about, you hold a private key that they have no knowledge about. transactions must use both of those private keys in order to be valid. if the company is hacked they can't steal your funds, if you are hacked they can't steal your funds (they'd have to hack you both). look up p2sh and m of n transactions for more information. in the future i imagine it will be made in such a way that users won't even know that is actually what is happening behind the scenes, but it eliminates counter party risk.

what solutions? bitcoin transactions are irreversible. you want to core devs to put some exception in the protocol that steals all those coins back from the theif? sorry. this is just plain ridiculous and not in the nature of bitcoin at all.
i think the currency you're looking for is greenbacks. you can bail each other out to all hell and not allow institutions to fail.
mt gox is already over. it failed. people who have lost their money there will have to live with those losses. that's how a free market works. 
'the community' is not in complete control of the purse. private key owners control whatever fraction of that purse independently. your posts frighten me, frankly. i feel as though you have no concept of the nature of bitcoin and what you've gotten involved in. if you want to crowdfund that's fine. but there will be no implementation in the protocol to reverse any funds, and there will be no bailout built into the protocol. you can be sure of that.

considering the ENTIRE purpose of bitcoin was to remove third parties from transactions, i find it strange that you would both want bitcoin to succeed and be in favor of banking institutions. 
adding the third party back in negates any benefit of bitcoin. you might as well use fiat currencies then. I think you should seriously think over your position on bitcoin because it appears to be in direct juxtaposition of what bitcoin is all about. 
edit, some quotes from the whitepaper:
"What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, 
allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted 
third party. "
"A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online 
payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a 
financial institution"
"These costs and payment uncertainties 
can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments 
over a communications channel without a trusted party"
the white paper is literally riddled with counter points to your argument that bitcoin needs banking institutions to hold peoples money. I think you've got involved in the wrong currency. your ideals are not aligned with what bitcoin 'is all about'

it's actually a transaction hash, so changing noncritical data changes the hash but not the actual inputs/outputs of the transaction. 
so it doesn't really 'work like an id, smell like an id'
in fact it works like a hash, and if the data is changed, the hash changes. it's an oversight on mt gox's part.
the other exchanges were affected because bitcoind allows change addresses to be spent unconfirmed, and when someone is dos'ing the network with mutated tx hashes, that can lead tx's never getting confirmed.

you're worrying about RNG implementation and not bitcoin's keyspace. 
the thing is that even if the RNG isn't truly random, it's not just the seed that determines the private key. so it's resistant to being brute forced. look up how a private key is generated and then what happens to the private key to become a public key. 
you need two keys generated with the exact same seed and the public keys corresponding to those to be able to determine the private key. you'd have to know the keys were generated from the same RNG and that the RNG was faulty.

no, they can't get the public address. mathematically, i'm not sure how this works. but often in cryptographic systems operations are easily done one way but very hard to do in the opposite direction. considering stealth addies used ECDSA i believe that's the case here as well. 


as long as they only share the stealth addy, and nonce publicly, yes.

If bitcoin was not anything new, and was simply online cash, I would completely agree with you. However while it has some similar properties it's a gross simlification to say that it is the exact same as cash. You're completely disregarding my comment on how trust is taken away from the third party and distributed over the network. Bitcoin does that. 
Have a look at trustedcoin's business model. They allow you to trustlessly store funds with them by splitting the responsibility of what used to be one private key into 3, any 2 must be used for a transaction to move forward. They help secure your funds but are incapable of stealing them. 
Bitcoin is not a debt-based system like fiat currencies are. For more on the origins of money see: 
While I appreciate this conversation. I really don't have to time to sit here and convince you all day. Read into bitcoin's alternative transaction types (that make it different from cash; voting, m of n transactions, pay to script hash, smart contracts).
Indeed Mike Hearn (core dev) has publicly stated that if bitcoin is just online cash, it ends in the same game (stored in banks). And provides no benefit to society. You have to look at the properties that make bitcoin different from cash to see how bitcoin makes it possible to securely store money without needing banks. 
Thanks for the convo.

are you just making up words? please direct me to the point 'about what makes a currency work'. we were discussing third party banking in bitcoin, not the fundamentals of 'how a currency works'. 
considering the white paper says in the first paragraph: "A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online 
payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a 
financial institution."
I think i'm not overstepping when I say: "the entire purpose of bitcoin was to remove third parties from transactions"

I wasn't debating whether it 'can' either. It's more than obvious it can. I'm debating whether it should.
re-read his statement. it's an argument that bitcoin won't work unless it has traditional banking


my argument is that if you marry traditional banking with bitcoin, you end up with no net benefit. the argument that 'it's worked better so far' is not a logical one, because nothing like bitcoin has ever existed before. therefore you can't use previous success to determine future success.

if you want to complain about semantics that's fine. if you look at an actual transaction "id" it sure looks like a hash, not an id. i get your point that it's called a 'txid' in the source...

it doesn't have to. it just has to be a valid address. you can generate an infinite number of offline addresses, those addresses will be valid and not in the blockchain. you can send bitcoins to them, then they will be in the blockchain with a balance.

You actually make a good point.
The concern isn't GHash, the concern is in a system which allows GHash to thrive. If the rules of the game were changed, ghash wouldn't exist.
Lots of other posters here are conflating what you're saying with saying 'big mining pools aren't much of a threat'. You're actually saying the opposite, they are a threat, but they aren't to blame.

My analogy was meant to show that you're pointing out something which is *obvious*, in that manner I feel it was sufficient, even if it wasn't a perfect analogy. 
It goes without saying that miners are needed to validate transactions, that is the nature of the protocol. You're pointing it out like an "ah-ha!" moment when it's just something we already know.
The other claims you're making of other people; bitcoin being perceived as perfect, ignorant of the value of mining, bitcoin being immune to crashes, appear to be your own projections on .

There are two spots in the post where they say what they are spending and how much, the first is in the part  you quoted:


In reference to your "hundreds of thousands in legal"


Even if they sold ALL of that 1500 BTC immediately (which they didn't) that would only be around 700k. The part that they did sell was the ~300k for legal and rent.
Ethereum selling a few 100k USD worth of coins has nothing to do with the downtrend.

we're talking about the exact same issue.... except it's not because it tracks transaction hashes. the qt client tracks inputs and outputs, not transaction hashes. 
the wallet gets out of sync because of how i previously stated the qt client treats change addresses (amounts you've sent to yourself) as safe, however the DoS of malled transactions can create a duplicate of that, and only one of those transactions will get confirmed. that's an issue if you've already used the unconfirmed change address in another tx. but it's not because it's solely tracking tx hashes.

if you're converting to USD you give returns in USD, and stipulate that in your terms. 
it doesn't 'prove btc is not a currency'. volatility is a product of lack of market depth, as the market gets greater depth, volatility will reduce. criticizing a currency for being in it's infancy is not a criticism. yet you can still take btc today and process returns in usd, as long as you inform the customer.

random lottery on all the transactions in a block give users incentive to include at least one transaction per block. it would bog the blockchain down incredibly. 
also, i rather like the idea of miners being incentivized for their purpose (to secure the blockchain), rather than a lottery for senders/receivers of transactions. IMO
whether it's running on 'fluttercoin' is irrelevant. you can't include hard forks to bitcoin on a whim. altcoins are the testing ground, if it proves viable after years of operation maybe it will be included, but i doubt it as there seems to be serious downsides to it.

nope. most point of sale software does analysis on the network propagation before accepting the transaction (how many nodes your transaction is being relayed by). that means they don't accept an unconfirmed transaction immediately (although it appears to happen very quickly)
when you send a transaction with a proper fee, the network propagation increases rapidly. when it's over a certain threshold, the probability of it being included in the next block approaches 100%. so you can't just double spend the money to yourself.
if you send with no fee, you will not get anywhere close to the same network propagation (have a look at OP's transaction  see 'estimated confirmation time') therefore a point of sale terminal will not accept the payment, it will never reach the required threshold of network propagation across the nodes.

it will never be taken as seriously as bitcoin for obvious reasons.... but it doesn't have to
it exists for a different crowd, and solely for use on the internet. you see somebody saying something you agree with, send them 100 doge. it's a few cents yet it means something. it's also friendly and approachable to people who don't know anything about cryptocurrencies.

the error in bitcoin-qt was different.
bitcoind/bitcoin-qt track inputs/outputs correctly, they dont just rely on tx hashes.
however bitcoind also allows unconfirmed change addresses to be used as inputs in transactions. that is a related issue, but it is far different from relying solely on tx hashes. if you have bitcoind/qt all you have to do is wait for your change addresses to confirm before you create a new tx

it would be better to use a heirarchical deterministic wallet such as electrum. generate the seed on a secure computer, write down the seed. on your other computers you can start electrum and put in that seed, it can then get the balance for you and you can have the same 'wallet' on multiple computers. all you need to remember is the seed.
of course if you are on a compromised computer, someone can steal your seed or the password encrypting your wallet.

sure it does. a block usually doesn't include all circulating unconfirmed transactions. during that hour or so that the block took to confirm, the amount of unconfirmed tx being relayed by nodes went up a lot, when that block was finally solved, there were likely many left over transactions that didnt get confirmed. having a few blocks come in quick succession afterwards gets those pending transactions confirmed.

sorry but you're missing the point i'm trying to clarify here.


no that's a public and private key. the public is the 'address'. a wallet is a collection of private keys. have a look at bitcoin-qt or electrum. you can import and export a **wallet** which is a **collection** of private-public keys. it's not a single address.

posted this elsewhere in the thread, but just so you can see it:
 the higher the network propagation in an unconfirmed transaction the more likely it is to be included in the next block, it takes less than 30 seconds usually for the network propagation to reach a point such that you can be 90+ percent sure it will be in the next block.

if you're the one sending, you wouldn't need to look through the blockchain for the tx as you would know the public address already.
stealth addresses don't hide anything from the sender, they just hide it from the rest of the world observing. nobody else would know how much you send or to what address. all any outsider would know about the tx is the nonce and the stealth address. they wouldn't know the amount the sender sends.... so they don't have that information to look up.


that's not true. for the reasons i just presented. it keeps the transaction 'hidden' from the rest of the world. nobody else but the sender and receiver know the amount or to what address the funds were sent.

I think your colour metaphor confuses more than it helps. Especially when you break it by saying "pass 3 different colors over and over into a hash function"; if you're going to make a metaphor, it has to be consistent. i.e. Colours don't get passed to hashing functions, it's an inconsistency.

Their site doesn't say that they sell the Bitcoin so I'm not sure where you are getting your info from. 
You're nitpicking and you understood what I meant perfectly. The inverse of your statement is also true; if value in btc drops you won't lose any money.
In any case I don't see where on their site it says they sell the Bitcoin when you lock it. In fact it doesn't appear like they are holding fiat at all. It looks like they are hedging their bet on the value of btc going up.

all of the people agreeing with him... do you see the algorithm he presents also includes 2 'magic numbers'?
it's not much of an improvement over a set constant for block size... yes, it changes over time, but you have no data to suggest whether the magic numbers he is choosing will be good or not. At least I have not seen any data to quantify his magic number vs the 20mb magic number. 
also as I've written elsewhere in this thread: "A max block size doesn't mean every block is that size, it just means that the size can't be more than that. The block size itself can grow organically by simply raising the upper limit on how big it can be."

and yet his algorithm includes 2 numbers which are constants and arrived at by pure speculation. How is that an improvement? Because it changes over time? 
Does it change over time well enough? Why does it need to? A max block size doesn't mean every block is that size, it just means that the size can't be more than that.
The block size itself can grow organically by simply raising the upper limit on how big it can be.

because the funds that spend the coins from 1MZD are already out in the Bitcoin network in the form of that transaction, therefore it's not going to just disappear and return to it's previous state. the transaction will be included in a subsequent block, any new transactions that spend the inputs already marked as spent in the wallet would be a double spend transaction.

It would seem that history is littered with failed currencies in countries which also had banks. Zimbabwe, Belarus, Yugoslavia, Peru, Angola, Argentina, Chile (all in the last 100 years).
This is why I'm not sure what point you're trying to make when you say 'banking economies work far better'.
I'm also not sure how it's relevant, as I'm not proposing we replace all fiat currencies with bitcoin.
My only point is that banking isn't strictly needed with bitcoin because due to its digital nature and additional transaction types, it's not necessary to secure your money. It also is in contrast of the reason it was first created: to reduce fees by not paying the middleman.
I said this in another comment. The early bitcoin entrepreneurs tried to take the current financial system and put bitcoin on top of it to make money. I hope that bitcoin sparks some real innovation in the second wave of entrepreneurs that find new business models.
If it ends up being the same as cash (stored in a bank, third party used to send/receive) it offers no additional value. We'll have to see what happens. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 04:00:46

"Limiting the size of a block means people are encouraged to add miner fees to transaction to make sure their transactions are prioritized"
this assumption only works if the number of transactions remains static(ish) and if processing of transactions never improves.
If the number of transactions increases and they are able to be processed quickly then it stands to reason you would want to include as many transactions in a block as possible to maximize your profit.

the attack vectors for a service like this are huge. it has nothing to do with brute forcing a private key.
look how difficult it is for companies to safely guard consumer information, this is exactly the same thing, the only difference is that since bitcoin is digital money there is a direct cash incentive for the hack. whereas with a hack on say Walmart customer records, the incentive is through selling the information on the market afterwards.
think about all the processes that are running on a linux server that hosts the hot wallet. customers need to withdraw bitcoins, so there has to be some mechanism for that, only 1 attack vector needs to get exploited out of hundreds/thousands in order for an attacker to start gaining access to the machine.

that is exactly what it is. coinkite is holding your bitcoins like a bank, the bitcoins you have given to them are theirs, not yours (you don't control the private keys).
the service relies entirely on your trust that they will give you the same amount of coins back that you have given them. 
that's not in the spirit of what bitcoin is about. blockchain.info provides all of the advantages of online web wallets but allows control over your private keys.

I didn't state that open source software is infallible. The project has to be released and used for it to be popular and for people to look at the code, at that point bugs will be found and you may say "look open source software is insecure" when it's just a part of the process of making it more secure.
Bitcoin had a few major insecurities in it's lifetime that were caught by the community and fixed. It's the nature of the process.
@_date: 2015-01-21 00:53:18


I don't think so. I'm not saying we couldn't be better, but look at something like pgp, it has been considered 'secure' for a very long time and is an open source project. 
Your argument could be applied to open source in general yet in practice we know that things don't work that way. People collaborate on open source projects and submit fixes even for little to no financial incentive. 
Have a look at the pace CVE's are found in open source projects. It happens all the time, people are constantly finding vulnerabilities and submitting them. 
I think projects which require strong cryptography and are used widely will eventually follow the 'red hat model' eventually, where private companies employ an individual just to work on that project because it's beneficial to them and the ecosystem. 


You place trust in many developers (and in some cases audits also) vs just someone's word that it's 'secure'. Arguing that they are the same when they have completely different models is stupid IMO.

I stipulated 'popular' in regards to the open source project. A popular project has likely been looked at by competent people. I'm not stating a rule that is always true, just a heuristic.
About your other point, it depends on the auditor. The NSA provides and recommends standards, some of those have been shown to be actively trying to weaken available cryptographic tools. A closed source project audited or recommended by the NSA I would be hesitant of.
If the project is closed source and audited then you place all of your trust in the auditor.

No, miners make entries in a ledger, wallets just broadcast and transactions. Simplifying descriptions are good, but that statement isn't a simplification, it's untrue.

Sure, but they position themselves as a bitcoin bank, which means that they control the private keys, so that goes without saying. Them using the term "mutli-sig" is to show that they use secure cold storage practices on their reserves.

you're anticipating small evolutionary steps forward in computing for the next 120-odd years.
that is an incorrect assumption to make, in my opinion. most researchers think we are 5-10 years away from the first quantum computer that can usefully do something. look at how fast technology progresses... it's not going to take 100+ years for quantum computing to get into the hands of the average person. 
that kind of a step is a revolutionary step forward and would likely alter the way software is written and run as we know it. you can't just 'update the code' in that event. 
a common fallacy around here is that every major obstacle to bitcoin is simply a small update away from being solved. that's an overly simplistic view to have.

bitstamp and a few others did. 
Bitstamp was notable specifically because they moved all their coins to one address (if memory serves) and signed a message from that address to cryptographically prove their holdings, the movement of coins created the highest bitcoin days destroyed until that point in time. 
It is not outside the norm for a bitcoin exchange to sign a message from an address proving ownership over their reserves. 
It is, however, outside the norm for them to prove their USD reserves. 
@_date: 2015-04-17 19:58:21


I have no idea what 'show a full cold wallet' means. 
I don't think you understand what a cryptographic signature is, otherwise you wouldn't consider it a gimmick.
It proves ownership over an address, if that address has thousands of BTC in it, then you've just proven you have control over an address with that btc, thus 'proving your reserves'. 
There was no evidence they lost access, they did it because sometimes it's responsible to show your customers you act in good faith. 
Your entire argument is based upon the concept that 'if nothing looks wrong, then there's no reason to assume it is'
When in reality bitcoin history is littered with companies who appear to be functioning fine until one day they lose everything.

you seem to have difficulty comprehending a system with more than one moving part.


that is EXACTLY what wallets are for. What they are NOT for are 'altering the ledger' that's the job of the miners (though i'd prefer the term 'adding to' than 'altering')
your assertion here:


is false. 
as a thought experiment, think of a scenario where there is a conglomerate of miners that have decided to exclude all transactions broadcast from a certain IP. if wallet's were all that was required to 'altered the ledger', the offending ip broadcasting its transactions would still be able to add it's new transactions to the ledger.
However we know that a wallet merely signs and broadcasts transactions, miners select transactions and add them to the ledger. 


perhaps you should take your own advice.
@_date: 2015-02-02 21:04:16
My hacking prowess? I claimed what you said was false, and that you don't know what you're talking about.
if hashing algorithms unhackable as you claim, why don't you explain how 
md5, a hashing algorithm is almost completely broken. "The security of the MD5 hash function is severely compromised. A collision attack exists that can find collisions within seconds on a computer with a 2.6 GHz Pentium 4 processor (complexity of 224.1)"
SHA-1 isn't completely broken but weakened (
To assume that SHA-256 will be invincible forever and ever is foolish, and your claim that cracking a hashing function is in any way similar to 'hacking  pythagorean's theorem' shows that you haven't got a CLUE what you're talking about. You know nothing about math, even less about cryptography, and yet have full confidence to assert a complete falsehood as truth. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 16:04:05


so far
declaring the encryption used in bitcoin as unhackable, meaning can never be hacked, is not true. as time passes people will discover cracks to weaken the encryption bitcoin uses, in an ideal scenario we would then move to something more secure... things dont always work in ideal ways.

I think you're being intentionally dense at this point.


I see no reason why you restate something I already said: "Tx are broadcast by nodes..." but at least you can agree on that.
Writing entries in the blockchain is EXACTLY what miners do. What is an entry? an entry is a block, and it contains the transactions relayed by nodes and chosen by miners to be included.
if i broadcast a message that says 'my name is leshow - signed leshow'
and you are a miner and you choose that message to be included in a block you solved, you are writing my message in the blockchain. i.e. '**making an entry in the ledger'** the content of the message in my hypothetical scenario is my signed note "my name is leshow"
To further prove my point that 'entry' is exactly the correct word to use, have a look at the definition of entry:


The act of creating a block and adding it to the blockchain is 'making an entry in the ledger'. the fact that the ledger contains transactions that aren't originated from the miner doesn't mean that it isn't the miner which makes the ledger entry. 
**If you want to argue this point, have your bitcoin node 'make an entry' in the blockchain without a miner.** 
I think you started off on the wrong foot, when you attributed something to me that I didn't say, you claimed i said something like 'miners make the transactions', when what i said was 'miners make entries in the ledger'.
I hope you learned something here.

well.... no.... the value of the entire bitcoin economy was ACTUALLY zero. you can hear mike hearn say that in some talks he's given. he first found the project in 2009, back then there were just a handful of people transferring the coins around for fun and testing this cool new idea. but the coins had zero value.... the entirety of bitcoins market actually had no value, not 'very little value' which seems to be your argument to escape this fact.
use your critical thinking, a simple thought experiment. when bitcoin was created satoshi was the only one that had any bitcoins. the value of the bitcoins then was zero. when the first few developers started playing around with it, the value was still zero. bitcoins didnt gain any value until afterwards.
so to reiterate, it did once have a zero value, therefore it can return to a zero value. you are wrong in saying that it 'must' have a non-zero value.
i don't perceive this to be a weakness of bitcoin, and you shouldn't either. no need to rationalize or fabricate arguments to the contrary.

also loaning money from bitcoins is probably the worst thing you can do. say you sell a few coins for 1.5k in 3 months they pay you back that 1.5k, but those bitcoins would have been worth 3k. it's lose-lose.
@_date: 2013-12-30 14:52:58
rather than trying to do mental backflips to argue against the fact that bitcoin has no intrinsic value. you should do some research, the fact that it has no intrinsic value doesn't matter. people who misunderstand austrian economics think that currency must be tied to something that is purposeful (which gives it value). that is incorrect. 
i suggest you read 'shelling out' by nick szabo as a primer on what makes good currency. 
tl;dr it's not a weakness that bitcoin doesn't have intrinsic value, so stop trying to backwards rationalize that it does have it.

backup and encrypt your private keys to cold storage (in multiple spots). leave instructions in your will.
paper wallet could also work, but remember that most paper wallets spend their complete amount in one transaction, so whoever you are transferring the coins to needs to know they need to transfer the coins off the paper wallet immediately and not re-use it

actually since we don't know who he is, we can't reason why he might have wanted to remain anonymous. an individual can have many different motivations, perhaps he just didn't want any of the limelight. 
the fact is that we don't know why he wanted to remain anonymous and guessing as to why is fallacious

there is no 'taking a bite' on centralization. the entire point of bitcoin is being decentralized, the problems it had to solve (byzantine general problem, double spend, etc) were all related to that ultimate goal. if you centralize the currency by handing it over to some 'community of anonymous admins' you defeat the purpose. now i have to trust PEOPLE instead of trusting a system.
you can't code in dollar parity. value is whatever people want to pay for it. the 'speculation aspect' of the currency is not something inherent in the currency itself, it's something we created around it.
i didn't say it the first time but i'll say it this time. it's obvious you haven't done much research on how bitcoin works. 
and to your original point, yes it is possible that a currency could be made which has features that can't be ported into bitcoin

many people suspect satoshi to be nick szabo. if you read szabo's writings, he considers trusted third parties to be security holes. following that line of thinking, bitcoin is the financial system with that security hole plugged

they control what is added or changed in the bitcoin protocol and main bitcoin client. this is a huge amount of power when you think about all the money in bitcoin right now and that could potentially be in bitcoin.
while i disagree that they are in the pocket of the FBI, the bitcoin foundation does have a significant amount of power.
@_date: 2013-12-30 15:03:14
you realize that bitcoins have already been worthless in the past right?
back when satoshi and a few others were exchanging the coins, it had all of the same qualities, but it had no value. 
rather than trying to fabricate an argument about why bitcoins have intrinsic value, you should realize that intrinsic value is not necessary for a good currency

he concludes that bitcoin can't have non-zero value based on its properties.
however bitcoins did once have a zero value. they didn't get value until people thought they had value. that means under certain conditions they can return to zero again, making his argument invalid.
i don't question that bitcoin was designed to have the attributes of a good currency. but that doesn't mean it MUST have non-zero value.

in that case:
- you're incorrect about fractional reserve banking not being able to exist. a 'bank' could be started that could say 'deposit your coins with us, we will hold them for you and insure them'. they could then hold a fraction of the coins and invest the rest, just like a traditional bank does.
- transactions being validated is not a 'transparent network'. it's about a decentralized network reaching a consensus. look up the byzantine generals problem. this is the problem that bitcoin solves to determine valid transactions.
- the network is not transparent, it's public. there is a major difference here. it's a public ledger of addresses and transactions, not a transparent one.
perhaps the beer clouded your thinking, but i think you ought to do some more reading into the nuts and bolts.

i really don't understand your reasoning. the entire purpose of bitcoin is that it isn't 'backed' by anything. in fact, it's impossible to be 'backed' because the payouts follow a mathematical formula and it is NOT centralized. that's the good part

FRB can absolutely exist with bitcoin. i think you're confused as to how the blockchain actually works. i can take your bitcoin, and thousands of other people's bitcoin, and invest the majority of them. i don't have to have all the bitcoins on hand to cover all my customers withdrawals, i only need to hold enough so that i can cover a certain amount of withdrawals. whether it's bitcoin or cash it makes no difference.
you should read mike hearn's position on this (bitcoin foundation developer). he acknowledges the fact that if bitcoin is just a currency, it's will eventually lead to the same fate as cash (banks and FRB).
however, there are unimplemented features of bitcoin that will hopefully lead to banks not being necessary. i suggest you look up smart property and smart contracts on the bitcoin wiki.

@_date: 2013-12-30 14:55:55
you are incorrect.
during the beginning of bitcoins existence it had all of the properties you mentioned, yet it's value was actually zero. mike hearn and satoshi (and others using the client in the beginning) transferred the coins to each other back and forth. yet the coins had no value, despite having all the qualities you say.
bitcoin didn't start having value until people started paying for them. bitcoins have no intrinsic value, yet that doesn't mean they can't be a good currency.
