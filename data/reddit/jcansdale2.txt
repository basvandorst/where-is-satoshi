Wasn't that caused by some miners not validating blocks at all? In this case won't blocks be validated as soon as they're downloaded?

I find it counter-intuitive that hard-forks would require SPV users to update. Is there a technical reason for this?
I've been discussing this recently and would like to get your opinion on it. If there was a hard-fork with 99.5% (as opposed to just 75%) of the hash-power on board, do you think old nodes would still be insecure and vulnerable?
I'm struggling to see a likely attack vector when blocks on the minority chain are taking over a day to confirm and there is a massive transaction backlog. Wouldn't the network become unusable for people of the minority chain and they would be forced to upgrade?
@_date: 2016-03-14 20:48:27
It does indeed appear to be a tricky problem. I was thinking about it from the perspective of a service that makes fee estimations. Would factoring in the contents of the mempool make the estimate vulnerable to malleability attacks?
@_date: 2016-01-20 18:22:52


Bitcoin is the chain with the highest market cap. All the rest are altchains. :)
@_date: 2016-03-14 20:41:06


I didn't realize fee estimation was baked in like this. Do you know what this function bases its estimate on?

Someone would have had to create a transaction that appeared to spend locked funds to force through the soft fork at 75% adoption?
@_date: 2016-01-17 15:45:17


Doesn't it make sense to change the block header version when attempting a hard rule change? We could do a soft-fork based on the version field in plenty of time before the hard-fork. The minority fork would have no chance of remaining viable with its slow block confirmation and transaction backlog.
@_date: 2016-01-17 16:03:03
It depends very much on the change. The previous 3 version updates made complete sense as soft-forks. To soft-fork something like a block size increase (which is possible) would add a crazy amount of complexity (extension blocks and more).
@_date: 2016-01-18 09:49:11
It looks like a lucky streak. There were similar spikes on 27 Dec and 4 Jan.
@_date: 2016-01-27 18:53:53
I'm interested to know why you would prefer this to a regular hard-fork. From what I understand, this would require all Bitcoin users to update their software. A hard-fork wouldn't require SPV wallet users to update (or am I mistaken). I don't know what percentage of users this would be.
@_date: 2016-01-13 20:14:17
The last 3 soft fork version updates triggered at 75%. There's no reason why the block size version update couldn't trigger a soft fork at 75% and only hard fork when 95% of the hash power is on board. It seems fair to keep the initial trigger consistent.
@_date: 2016-01-20 18:42:00
What would Kraken's position be if there was a sustained hard-fork?
@_date: 2016-01-17 17:40:01


Agreed. I can imagine something that's technically backwards compatible, but not a user experience that doesn't suck (complete with black holes).
@_date: 2016-01-16 08:12:25


It removes a limit that was intended as an anti-spam measure, not a consensus rule change. Assuming consensus is reached, this client is no more an altcon than versions of Bitcoin before the limit was introduced.
@_date: 2016-01-31 19:35:18
There are (at least) 3 categories of user we need to consider when thinking about compatibility. They are miners, full node operators and SPV wallet users.
Miners are easy, they will always need to update their software when there is a hard or soft-fork.
Full node operators might not need to update if there is a soft-fork but will need to update if there is a hard-fork (if they want to be on the new chain).
SPV wallet users are the interesting group because it depends on the change (not on whether it's a hard or soft fork). They wouldn't need to update for soft-fork segwit but they would need to update for a hard-fork segwit.
For a blocksize increase the opposite is true. A SPV wallet user might not need to update for a hard-fork blocksize increase, but they would for a "[forced]( soft-fork blocksize increase.
There are good reasons to favor a soft-fork segwit and a hard-fork blocksize increase. It certainly isn't as black and white as some soft-fork and hard-fork fundamentalists might have you believe. ;)

@_date: 2016-01-27 08:58:04


The way I've heard the term "soft-hardfork" used is for a softfork that uses an extension block to increase capacity while leaving the original block empty. Users of old software would stop seeing transactions confirm. Is that what you mean by soft-hardfork?
@_date: 2016-01-12 11:09:03


It is tricky keeping everything quantifiable. How about, "Chain with the highest market cap"? It seems reasonable to choose the chain that allows users to extract the most value from their coins.
In theory you could allow them to trade on both chains, but that would only help facilitate a permanent fork and creation of an alt coin.
@_date: 2016-01-24 18:33:52


I'm interested to know what you mean by this.
@_date: 2016-01-15 22:45:19
By this definition the original Bitcoin client is also altcoin. Do you believe the original version of Bitcoin is an altcoin?
@_date: 2016-01-13 09:13:15


A very good point it is too. :)
Looking further at the code, the block version enforcement appears to happen at 95% compared to 75% when the rule changes start being enforced. This could be a moot point though because any transactions that violate the new rules might (will?) get stuck in the unconfirmed transactions queue of un-updated nodes. They will continue to be included in blocks that will never be built on by updated nodes. Does that make sense?
@_date: 2016-01-12 19:03:06
Much appreciated, thanks for finding it.
@_date: 2016-01-24 19:30:28
This is what I thought you meant. It's actually more complex than that and this is only half the story.
It's true a soft-fork is explicitly triggered once the new version has 95% support. This soft-fork enforces a rule that block headers must contain the new version number (or later). You can see the code for this [here](
The confusing bit is that soft rule changes for the new version start being enforced before then at only 75% support! You can see the code for this [here]( As soon as a transaction is broadcast that violates the new rule, a soft-fork will be triggered. The means the soft-fork might activate any time after 75% support is achieved.
@_date: 2016-01-24 19:51:01
Are you saying that after 75%, nodes will still happily accept blocks that contain transactions that break the new rules?
@_date: 2016-01-18 13:39:30
It's easy to forget that random is lumpy. The spike doesn't look so unusual within the context of the 3 month chart. Have a look and see what you think.
@_date: 2016-01-13 12:11:29


Interesting. Does this mean that between the 75% and 95% super-majoritys being established, no one has attempted to send an incompatible (with the soft rule change) transaction?
@_date: 2016-01-24 20:16:00
I was wrong. Thanks for taking the time to educate me! :)
@_date: 2016-01-29 18:48:15
Are you talking about a more sophisticated version of SPV than the one described in the Bitcoin whitepaper?


The version of SPV described here appears to trust block depth rather than independently verifying blocks.

Bitcoin Unlimited is an alternative client that will accept larger blocks if there is enough consensus. Is it okay to talk about Bitcoin Unlimited?

What do you think of the current text?
@_date: 2016-01-12 19:22:02


It appears to happen as soon as the super-majority has been established and the new rules come into effect. See [here]( and [here](
This could also happen in the lead up to a hard rule change. That would quickly get any stragglers on board. :)
@_date: 2016-01-12 16:20:02


Very interesting! Any chance you could give me a link to where this is documented/discussed?
@_date: 2016-01-13 08:50:50


The economic reasons I think you're referring to are that this would be a hard fork that the economic majority would ignore. The miners would be generating worthless (or certainly less valuable) coins. The ignored miners would run out of funds and be forced to stop mining the worthless chain. Why would you disagree?
P.S. I'm assuming you're using "longer chain" as shorthand for "chain with the most work."
@_date: 2016-01-17 16:30:33
You could implement the increase by introducing a 2nd transaction pool. Old nodes could continue using the original (smaller) transaction pool which higher fees. Updated nodes would have the option of using a larger pool with low fees. I'm not saying it's a good idea, bit it could be done in a backwards compatible way. ;)
@_date: 2016-01-29 19:30:47
Ah okay, I now understand what you meant in a previous comment.


I see what you mean there no SPV wallets that implement this strategy, but might future SPV clients implement other strategies instead? They might look at full blocks or only look at parent transactions. If only transactions were validated then that particular implementation wouldn't care about block size.
It looks like lightweight clients (simple SPV clients?) would be compatible with bigger blocks. Is that fair to say?
@_date: 2016-01-15 13:31:34
Bitcoiners have simultaneously split across another axis, the "softforkers" and the "hardforkers". Softforkers believe that Bitcoin should only be updated in a backwards compatible way so that users aren't forced to update their client if they want to continue using Bitcoin (a backwards compatible soft-fork). Hardforkers believe that for some updates, soft-forks introduce too much complexity/technical-debt and that Bitcoin should sometimes be updated in a simpler, non-backwards compatible way (a hard-fork).
is a Softforker/Bigblocker. is a Softforker/Smallblocker. is a Hardforker/Bigblocker. Please say if I've miss-characterized any of you.
I'm trying to think of good Hardforker/Smallblocker example. I think might be in this category. Charlie, what are your thoughts on hard-forks? Sometimes necessary to keep complexity under control but not required now for a blocksize increase - would you agree with that?
@_date: 2016-01-20 14:55:23


You realize this would be a hard-fork? You can't really use a hard-fork to avoid a hard-fork.
@_date: 2016-01-15 08:15:42
From what I understand, Theymos is only comfortable with soft-forks that maintain compatibility with older Bitcoin clients. He thinks that "forced" soft-forks (firm-forks) that would require clients to update should be treated like a hard-fork. I'll find quotes if you don't believe me.
IMHO the issue is about alternative Bitcoin clients, not just the security and integrity of the network. I would love to see a statement that suggests otherwise.
@_date: 2016-01-15 21:22:48
See the conclusion of the Bitcoin [white paper](
"They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism."
The Unlimited client will only accept larger blocks if consensus is reached using the Bitcoin consensus mechanism.
Are you sure the definition of altcoin you're using is accepted by more than a small fraction of the Bitcoin community? Is there even consensus for it among the moderators?
@_date: 2016-01-13 11:33:57


How about this: Bitcoin is the chain that contains the most valuable newly minted coins (post fork coins).
@_date: 2016-01-29 11:34:17


Gavin seems to think that SPV wallets would be compatible in his latest [BIP]( Might it not depend on whether a SPV wallet sees the block size as critical for fraud proof or whether it's happy to trust the longest chain for that parameter? If I was forced to guess which chain would turn out to be the most valuable (that persisted for at least 6 blocks), I'd take a punt on the longest one if the only difference was block size.
It seems there are some parameters that are designed to protect the network (such as block size) and some that protect the integrity of Bitcoin itself (such as the money supply). Do you think that distinction makes any sense?
@_date: 2016-02-02 13:20:07


This is indeed a clever and low impact upgrade mechanism. Given that it's possible to do a soft-fork without creating any forks, I'm curious to know why there tends to be an explicit soft-fork at 95% adoption based on the block version header?
@_date: 2016-02-02 14:54:57
Ah okay. So up until 95% adoption, non-standard transactions (or transactions that are invalid by the new rules) won't propagate around the network, but blocks that contain non-standard transactions will. After 95%, blocks that contain non-standard transactions will no longer propagate or be built upon. Is that right?
@_date: 2016-02-02 13:57:37


Wouldn't the 95% of upgraded miners reject the block, so it would be extremely unlikely to be much of a fork?
@_date: 2017-10-04 09:36:19
The intention was to allow replay protection without requiring any special software. The scriptSig to redeem these outputs is deliberately tiny (it's simply `04148f33be`). Assuming my workings are correct, it should make economic sense for these outputs to be cleared when fee levels are below 48 satoshi / byte (less if you bunch them together).
Workings below:
Here's an example replay protected tx that outputs the minim 2730 satoshi amount for a standard transaction.
  "hash": "5ef96f4831c2ff41867670cf40152326eaa12116d15350a912fbde2a8319cbef",
  "ver": 1,
  "vin_sz": 0,
  "vout_sz": 1,
  "lock_time": 0,
  "size": 42,
  "in": [],
  "out": [
    {
      "value": "0.00002730",
      "scriptPubKey": "OP_HASH160 e77dfed888d33a87c2f48849f54dc55f4e63e7b4 OP_EQUAL"
    }
  ]
Here's an example tx that redeems one of these replay protected outputs:
  "hash": "9e6d108ac28e747217669ef0e4b0e5b7b4c33814595b96dc2d49d6eb5f79f979",
  "ver": 1,
  "vin_sz": 1,
  "vout_sz": 0,
  "lock_time": 0,
  "size": 56,
  "in": [
    {
      "prev_out": {
        "hash": "5ef96f4831c2ff41867670cf40152326eaa12116d15350a912fbde2a8319cbef",
        "n": 0
      },
      "scriptSig": "03165c4d"
    }
  ],
  "out": []
This transaction is 56 bytes and looks like:
In this case all output is being spent as a fee, which comes out as 2730 / 56 = 48 (satoshi / byte). It would be in the economic interest of miners to sweep up these outputs individually when fee levels are below 48 satoshi / byte. Users could consume these outputs and receive free (or better) replay protection. These outputs won't remain in the UTXO set for long. ��
The latest commit uses the following:
scriptAddress: 3Bit1xA4apyzgmFNT2k8Pvnd6zb6TnwcTi
scriptSig: 04148f33be
scriptPubKey: OP_HASH160 6e0b7d51f9f68ba28cc33a6844d41a1880c58a19 OP_EQUAL
@_date: 2017-10-04 10:35:03
Anyone can claim free replay protection by including one of these outputs as an input. The minimum 2730 satoshi output should more than cover its own space in the transaction (unless fee levels are crazy).

51% of miners could easily vote on and soft fork a minimum fee rule. Perhaps they will one day if a block reward halving makes it uneconomical to turn on their machines.

I wonder how easy it would be to set up a monthly donation using BTC, LTC or ETH? At the moment I'm just holding BTC, but the fees seem a little high for monthly payments. I like the model though, so if you have any suggestions about how best to set it up. :-)
@_date: 2017-07-05 16:03:27
The thing is, because the 2x part is a hard fork, it doesn't matter whether it has 51%, 5% or 95% of the hash power. That chain is destined to go its own way however much or little support it has.
OTOH, Bip148 requires 51% of the hash power in order to be a threat to the rest of the network (unless it's doing some coordinated block withholding, when theoretically it would require less). Bip148 seems to be pretty much the definition of a 51% attack.
What am I missing?
@_date: 2017-07-05 23:29:56
I want to understand what you're saying here, but currently don't. What happens if 51% of the hash power follows Segwit2x, compared to if 49% does? It's not like the BIP148 chain would follow it because there's a hard rule change. What am I missing?
@_date: 2017-07-05 23:53:25
If we're talking about about BIP148, it makes complete sense. I didn't expect you to be quite so upfront in calling it a 51% attack!

I don't mind paying Patreon's fee because they're providing a useful service to artists, but I object to pretty much all the rest!
Hopefully over time your primary audience will come to hold crypto, some of which they might like to send your way. I'm interested in the psychological friction that might be stopping them from doing that.
- I don't want to use PayPay/CC, especially when I know you'd prefer bitcoin!

I doubt there's any need to ask them. They'll most likely throw their coin on the minority chain like confetti. Why waste hash-power disrupting a chain when you can get the resident miners hoovering up your mess?

I'm confused. Where is the 51% attack?
@_date: 2017-07-05 18:57:15


Thanks for the correction. I hadn't appreciated that. So a soft rule change is potentially a threat to the opposing chain, but not a hard rule change? It does sound like Segwit2x would make a particularly poor 51% attack. ;-)


That's what I initially assumed. I thought they were going to start orphaning non bit-4 blocks after they reached a certain threshold. After reading the following issue, I'm not so sure:
Do you still think they're planning a hard fork+soft? IMHO it would make a lot of sense!
@_date: 2017-07-05 19:14:15


Ah, I get it! The requirement for an above-1MB block is both more restrictive and less restrictive at the same time. That's neat.
I'm still surprised the plan isn't to start orphaning non bit-4 blocks after a certain threshold is reached. That would encourage miners to update their software and make a choice one way or the other in the lead up to the hard-fork.
@_date: 2017-07-06 00:10:26
Miners producing non-BIP148 blocks are the 51% attack?
