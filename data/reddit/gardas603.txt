The roll of the dice is other people’s actions, which are essentially impossible to predict...

Interesting. So can’t casino credits be considered a currency too, and gaming at a casino equivalent to currency extraction?
I guess I’m more interested on the legal justifications/first principles.

So, what distinguishes it from slot machines? Those are classified as gambling.

Sorry, that’s not true; you get a number of rights as you buy stock, and as you buy more, you also get control of the company, etc.

Ah. Yes! Totally agreed then!

I hear what you’re saying but dice and slots were also new technologies at some point, yet they’re heavily regulated. The fact that it’s a (new) technology has little bearing on the issue of whether it is akin to gambling or not.
Also, the system behind bitcoin is super cool, but bitcoin is not a productive technology in itself (i.e., it doesn’t fit into production processes to improve efficiency), so yes, you are investing, but not in the r&amp;d sense.

I’m actually interested in the rationale. So, if I run a random number generator with unknown seed and let people bet on it, it’s not gambling because the investors don’t know the expected value?

I can think of two reasons:
1. When you buy stock, you own part of a company. But there is no physical counterpart to a bitcoin.
2. Also, stock market investments are considered to contribute to the social good because they aggregate information. For example, commodity markets allow farmers to be able to predict revenue in advance. However, bitcoin provides no societal informational externalities.

Right. Maybe a legislator reads this post!... ;)

Makes a lot of sense! So why aren’t these things defined as gambling? Is it the time between investment and expected reward? Or the fact that there’s some consumption utility associated with having these items?
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:14:27
I’m just asking; not saying!
Stock markets provide information to decision makers, so the benefits are well understood. But bitcoin is based on pure investor beliefs about its own value; so it’s hard to the societal benefit seems void.

Ok, finally one clear rationale! Thanks

Great! Also, the last planet money podcast describes this super clearly.
