I use JAXX wallet. Works for multiple currency, and you have the keys. It is EXTREMELY risky to keep your coins in an exchange, since it can close, be hacked, not allow you to buy/sell, etc.

The price should go up either way, don't panic sell. It may not go up alot for months, but it probably will be up by the end of this year. TL;DR in my opinion hodl and ride the wave

Well, I recently picked up a computer from a flea market, and on it was government information and peoples personal information like finger prints, social sec  drug task force, anti terrorism task force, state stuff etc. You may get lucky, but if you do i'll take a bitcoin off your hands ;)
