I am definitely going to research that more. Great question!

I have sent them a message asking them to edit the numbers.
@_date: 2014-05-29 19:21:11
That was my thought as well.
@_date: 2014-06-05 19:42:11
They must have taken the article down. Bummer.
@_date: 2014-05-19 14:25:07
Great read.
@_date: 2014-05-28 15:35:42
One day is great, I hope many of them stay on board and continue to accept.
@_date: 2014-05-20 17:37:41
Awesome!

I feel that both companies and consumers drive bitcoin. Tese articles need to be commented on not only on reddit, but on the sites they are posted in. Making sure accurate information is out there is so important. Education is key.

Can we say.. completely different tools?

I didn't see a bitcoin mention, did I miss it?

This applies to all .edu e-mail addresses?

Not quite sure of the impact of the DISH portion of this article, although their acceptance of bitcoin is great thing.. but regarding that, and both Apple and Amazon, what are your thoughts?

Fun news!

Great to see BitScan on reddit!

Quite jealous! Hoping to head to a conference soon, possibly in Chicago over the summer.

Fantastic news! Can't wait to see these merchants added to Bitscans merchant map!

Followed through on the referenced articles.. this should state millions instead of billions. Might take the article down just for that. I know that a lot of the investments are based not only on the currency, but the technology behind it (which can be used for many other things I have learned)

I am not the biggest fan of politics, but the attention this gets, in addition to the ability to use bitcoin in more ways is a big positive in my book. 
@_date: 2015-11-19 21:22:22
I can only imagine. Do you think the person in article proposes is possible?
