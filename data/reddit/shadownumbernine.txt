Why are people seeming to say more often that BTC should be used as a store of value?
I understand that it has a scaling issue at the moment, but is it so problematic that it potentially could get overtaken in day-to-day transactions and interaction? What use would BTC if everyone is just holding it and not spending any, even if other coins are easier to use and adopt?
(please no hyperbole or "shitcoin" responses. Im wanting a clear unbiased answer, or at least some clarity.)

1)Most of my coin is in MyCelium: will I be "gifted" with BTC and B2X? How can I make sure I am transacting BTC and not B2X?
2) Some of my coin is on Gdax/Coinbase: How would I (safely) go about making money (or BTC) from getting rid of my B2X?
3) When wallets/exchanges provide you with equivalent B2X to your BTC after the fork, does that mean that your B2X will be equal to the **value** of your BTC, or equal to the **amount** of BTC you have?

Does this distinguish between transfers of btc from myself to myself (from coinbase/gdax to my personal wallet)?
How do i calculate those tax gains anyway?
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:43:54
Does(n't) that cost more?

Another question:
How the heck do you decide how much fiat you want tied up in an exchange in order to buy more BTC when youd like? Is there a faster way that say, from your account to gdax to btc then finally to your wallet?

Ok another question: Taxes. (In the US)
How does having BTC affect my tax reporting? Are there any resources to guide or help me through doing taxes if I have bitcoin (and choose to report it)? Do I even have to report it? What if I only have very few BTC? What if i have a lot?

Soo...Me and buddy more or less just got into Bitcoin. And this sub...can be heavy on the technical jargon and intense vigor about different aspects of bitcoin for a newer comer(but rightly so). I believe I've found my answer by reading through, but verification is key. So if there are other or better outlets than here that you've found clearer explanations, feel free to point me there!
Anyways here's the sitch. I've some BTC in coinbase, and some in Mycellium on Android (I will be upgrading to a new phone within the month, so i just to use my seed to restore my coin right?). From what ive read, my options are to: 1. Move all coins to MC, and wait until I know MC will continue on the Bitcoin blockchain, and not the forked one. OR 2. Move everything to a paper wallet instead, and wait to find what wallets are using the Bitcoin blockchain, and not the forked one
As for my buddy; has some in Coinbase and Jaxx on Android. 1. He would need to move to paperwallet all together, and wait, correct?
If there are some details missing, let me know. Or if im hilariously missing a point, laugh, but tell me why, lol.

No biggie, thanks for replying at all.
I was mostly asking because there seems to be *some* amount of skepticism (in this sub at least, surprise surprise) now regarding MyC due to something relating to Dash (a company they bought I think?) and how MyC hasn't been 100% clear as to how they treat forks. I prefer to stay with the app if possible (though they are definitely not new-user friendly). 
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:29:18


yeah, sorry I didnt make that clear. I'll use "MyC" cuz me 2lazy :P


So (correct me if Im wrong at any point): After moving my coins off coinbase to Mycelium (before the fork), I will have two currencies of temporarily equal value (after the fork), correct?. My next question would then be, is it safe to keep my coin in MyC at all since they may or may not be using the correct Bitcoin blockchain after the fork (based on what I've been trying to read)? If (for whatever reason) they don't, could I even move my BTC afterwards and maintain its value? As for my friend, is his only option to move to a paper wallet? He told me the fee to move his BTC to MyC would be half the amount of is coin. Ouch.
(Clarifying side question: Is there a method that allows me to move BTC I own from say, wallet to wallet, without it counting as a transaction (i.e the BTc is still under my control but I don't expect to pay a fee). Or am I misunderstanding something fundamental?)


So the seed generated in MyC, and the seed my buddy generated in Jaxx, can be used to recover *our own* BTC on say, a new device with even a different (BIP32) wallet?

Nah, youre fine. (some) people on this sub are...a little too over the edge. That said:
**Don't put any amount into Bitcoin you arent willing to lose.**
This is the point that a few others failed to get across (so far). I'm new into bitcoin myself (only had my coin for about a month in a half-ish), but what I have surmised is that since BTC is still new, that means its volatile. You could lose what you have because the market went waaaaaay south, or you could lose it mid transaction due to.....lots of technical reasons and/or user errors that I dont fully grasp myself yet lol. It happened to an also new-user buddy of mine unfortunately. 
People here will also tell (or yell at) you to move your coins off coinbase. The main reason, is because you dont own your own private keys...but count on some in this sub to shame you for taking a **100% new-user friendly step** in investing in Bitcoin (I started there too). For the most part, advice here can be helpful, but I concur that being new here, is kind of a exercise in frustration sometimes. Keep on learning for yourself, but parse this sub for **some** perspective on the BTC world. Just remember this is very small section of what and who is out there, and try not to let some folks here shout you down too much.

I gotcha. Just gonna need your passwords and Social Security card.
After that you'll best node on the network. Believe it!

Thank you!




Looking at a different comment below, does my seed have to match the app? As in I can only recover from MyC to MyC? Or can I do MyC to Jaxx(or whatever)? (Im still learning and researching though too btw)
