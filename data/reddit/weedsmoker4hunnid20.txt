@_date: 2018-01-31 22:41:47
I study bitcoin for a living so you shouldn’t get smart with me 
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:15:15
K I’m reporting you for false reporting 
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:36:50
Thanks, that's the answer I was looking for 
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:03:44
????? Joke or?
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:16:10
Yeah I think my plan is to withdraw if we hit $20k and I’ll leave like 25% in there. A crash is inevitable if it continues up at this speed
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:20:32
Idk quadratic formulas? I’m new to this
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:14:14
This is what I think will happen but many people seem to think it won’t crash down like it did before. I don’t know if it’s smart to just hold and hope
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:16:58
you're actually right. Thank you for that. I was a pretty stupid high school-er
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:25:03
It just happened bro
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:16:23
No i'm saying i probably would of noticed whats happening and would of bought more asap because i had a job and a couple thousand dollars and if i put my money into anything, i pay attention to it
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:57:35
same lmao i wanted to buy mdma with bitcoin 2 years ago and then just keep a bunch of bitcoin on hold so i could buy more  drugs later and not have to worry about it but i bailed because i didn't know how to get it to me without knowing for sure my parents wont see the package before i do. i should of just done it lol.
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:55:24
Idk what that means tbh but ok 
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:17:32
Yes yes i think lord snoop is calling from above, 420 blaze on = bitcoin success 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:22:10
I've been through this already. No you can't fuck my Mom 
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:05:58
Oh boy, i wish. I was kind of into bitcoin 2 years ago in high school but i was like "$200 for one bitcoin??? No way!!" because i low key wanted to buy some mdma because thats when people used bitcoin for that stuff and i am so mad at myself for not looking into it more. Lmao crazy to think if i just bought just one bitcoin, my life would be so much different right now 
@_date: 2018-02-01 04:01:59
I was just joking 
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:35:31
I'm using coin base because I heard it's very secure 
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:47:15
So in your judgement, do you think I should invest any more sometime soon and how much? I'm very willing to invest because I'm good at saving my money 
@_date: 2017-10-26 01:35:14
Ok great thanks 
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:12:37
Sorry, I'm a complete noob to all of this. What does that mean exactly? SegWit2X?  And what is the green? 
@_date: 2017-10-20 19:15:19
Thanks that's all I wanted to hear
@_date: 2018-07-30 06:48:33
