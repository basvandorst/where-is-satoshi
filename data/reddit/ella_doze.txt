Hahaha. Nice play, Apple. At least they recognize the new big deal. Not so new but you get me. For once, I'm happy with Apple. It might be the only time though. Hope my friends are ready. I'm about to bombard them all.

Lol, I see what you're trying to do there. But it's not gonna work. It's not gonna change the fact. Apple's losing it. Their prices are pointblank ostentatious. Converting them into Bitcoins won't change anything. I'm not complaining anyway. Those who really love the products will certainly pay for it.

China’s Bitcoin ‘tycoon’ and serial investor Li Xiaolai will take a hands-off approach to future blockchain projects, he announced on social media Sunday, September 30.
In an approach that appeared to take many by surprise, Li, well known as one of China’s rumored biggest Bitcoin bagholders and investors, appeared dissatisfied with fraudulent actors in the blockchain industry that were claiming he was part of their undertakings.
“From this day on, Li Xiaolai personally will not invest in any projects (whether it is blockchain or early stage),” his post on Chinese social media network Weibo reads, translated by Chinese tech journal TechNode:
    “So, if you see ‘Li Xiaolai’ associated with any project (I have been associated with countless projects without my knowledge, 99% is not an exaggeration), just ignore it.”
Li was likely referencing similar situations that have resulted in other cryptocurrency industry figures issuing warnings about such fraudulent actors. Since the beginning of the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) explosion in 2017 in particular, various well-known names have complained of their names appearing on lists of ‘advisors’ for blockchain projects, when in fact they had no connection.
