thank you very much.
@_date: 2014-12-03 04:14:48
Omg sorry. Here's the yelp: 
And here's our site:

Last year was amazing, came out the gate the first day with record breaking sales then it died down and found its level bringing in about 2500 sales over a period of a week starting with that first 1200 sale day.
         
This year it was half of that overall that but less of a burst and more a steady stream which is still trickling in.      
       
So I would say last year was better BUT only because we didn't have that initial surge the first day.
@_date: 2014-12-04 00:19:42
email me friend I would love to get my product into your shop asap
@_date: 2014-12-03 04:12:15
And nerd hoodies and nerd tanks... but yea mostly nerd stuff
@_date: 2014-12-03 19:20:56
We have 4 large windows and we covered them in large translucent atractive themes of stuff we like. We get plenty of light.

@_date: 2014-12-04 21:19:12
Thanks and so do we.
@_date: 2014-11-14 21:11:35
ahh no love.
@_date: 2014-12-02 23:45:12
Here's our new Yelp if you ever want to come by!
@_date: 2014-12-03 20:18:01
that we do!
@_date: 2014-11-07 01:04:38
for us last year it was 2. the site dropped for 3 hours and then a whopping 6!
@_date: 2014-11-20 10:02:23
same here
@_date: 2014-12-04 21:21:09
I don't remember those?
@_date: 2014-12-03 20:17:22
Yes, sadly they are not fans of our "nerd money" (that's what the printer says) the odd part is we all play video games like Dota 2 at our late night brainstorming sessions and that same printer watches Doctor Who while he prints so we're all nerds. We are a 6 man shop so were still pretty small, the cool thing is after all my preaching a couple of them did ask for part of their Christmas bonus in BTC, its a start!
@_date: 2014-12-03 04:19:41
Ooh I just had a great idea to turn that archway into a stargate. Yes I might do that. 
@_date: 2014-12-03 20:01:47
here's image: 
@_date: 2014-12-03 04:11:34
Awesome thanks
@_date: 2014-12-03 04:18:28
Thanks for asking. We've recently started keeping about 40% bitcoin. It also depends on how well that pay period is going. On a few occasions this year we've had to cash out chunks of btc to pay our awesome team.
@_date: 2014-12-03 19:12:46
Hahah that's plenty of time to get a shirt.
@_date: 2014-12-03 04:11:25
@_date: 2014-12-03 20:21:00
Yes in fact were looking for sales channels and wholesale customers as we speak. Its our goal this coming year to branch out and sell everywhere. Please email me at: info
@_date: 2014-12-04 21:18:50
Socal born and raised ;)
@_date: 2014-12-03 04:11:15
All in time my friend. 
@_date: 2014-12-03 19:12:13
@_date: 2014-12-04 21:20:59
No we've been shipping since Monday but whatever was ordered Monday went out today. Also the more we get the slower we tend to ship because a lot of these we print on demand so when there are 500 orders it will take an extra day or 2.
@_date: 2014-12-03 19:11:50
You can't see it in the pics but we have a rather large sign with our logo that says we accept btc
@_date: 2014-11-14 04:43:31
thanks for the upvotes so far!
@_date: 2014-12-03 04:26:39
Thanks 
@_date: 2014-12-03 04:10:56
Yes. Yes we do.
@_date: 2014-11-07 21:33:23
hahaha, I figured my username gave it away. My site is actually listed in OPs post as one of the givaways. But shameless I am so here goes: 
      
Boom shakalaka!
@_date: 2014-12-03 19:18:08
Not exactly, the purpose for the store is partly for fans to try and buy or pickup from but mostly its a showroom for our wholesale accounts we'll be opening up next year so you can get our stuff in bestbuys, hot topic, sears, and I hope game stops.
So that was the main reason we built it out but it also doubles as a store for our fans.
@_date: 2014-12-04 00:17:17
your a rock star, thank you for your work. I'll keep preaching the good word here and keep this sub updated.
@_date: 2014-12-03 19:10:43
Whoo that's a rough review .. anyhow here's the link to our bitcoin tees: 
And of course there in the store too.
Thanks for the link. I'm going to have to try harder next year.
@_date: 2014-12-05 00:42:51
Awesome! I'm so happy that my passion for bitcoin and my passion for my business can work so well together. This community is truly the best!
@_date: 2014-12-03 04:15:12
Gotta start somewhere.
@_date: 2014-12-04 22:36:05

@_date: 2014-12-03 19:21:26

@_date: 2013-11-28 02:13:12
I hope I understand the question, you can pay for it with BTC during the checkout page.
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:39:19

Working on it now...
@_date: 2013-10-30 20:27:18
Yea we ship to Europe. The quality is 100% cotton 30/1 and the cut is similar to American Apparel but our shirts run true to size.
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:27:41

not trying to advertise here (to much) but our site started taking bitcoin about a month ago after getting numerous requests from long time customers.           
          
All it takes is a demand, check out our site:             
             
BTW were having a massive black friday sale this weekend you should check it out.
@_date: 2013-10-30 13:31:20
yea, working on that. We just got it hooked up so off to the graphic team for the sliders and what not.
@_date: 2013-10-30 20:29:01
Yes we do custom shirts as long as the minimum is reached of at least 12 shirts. There is a $20 setup fee. Call us at: 714-277-4597 and ask for Brian.
