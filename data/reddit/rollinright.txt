There are already GUIs (I know of at least one for [eclair]( and one for [LND]( There is also [Coinbase's lightning ramp]( which will probably be the preferred method for non-technical users.
Other wallets will integrate lightning in time. But that is not necessary on day 1. And with its insanely cheap fees, it probably won't take long.
The merchants will begin accepting it once the customers are there.

Go try it out.
The comparison to Segwit is not fitting. Segwit was an efficiency improvement. Lightning is a whole other layer of functionality.
These comments at least got me feeling good that lightning is not currently priced in.

Here is to all the Bitcoin Cash bag holders on GDAX / Coinbase. ������
You made my day. Thanks to you, my Bitcoin wallet received a very nice boost. Made the dip way more palatable this time around.

So OP screenshotted this, even though he didn't realize what the fee had cost him. What reason would you screenshot this then? You can't reproduce this screen after the fact...
Trying to figure out where I can get a coffee for a dollar too...

What are you talking about?
It is very easy and quick to spin up many AWS nodes as opposed to running them on many different networks. So it indicates that these could have and likely are all set up by a small number of people.

Sounds a lot like a red herring to a very important issue.
