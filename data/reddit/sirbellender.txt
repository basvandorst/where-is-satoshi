Yeah but if you send it over LN to like an exchange or some merchant you will get credited for it without having to close your channel. The channel will stay open with a 0 balance forever while the BTC exist in somebody else's LN balance. I guess.
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:42:31
do you really need to close it? you can just send the whole balance of the channel anywhere.

At least you are honest with yourself. There are more people who made the same mistake and many of them will stay in denial and let their money go down the sink with BCH price. Some of them will even defend it and troll against BTC out of bitterness.

There are 3 main disadvantages to larger blocks:
1. Blockchain grows faster and takes up more HD. At 1MB per block, it grows ~55 GB per year. Double the blocksize, double the yearly growth.
2. Initial sync takes longer. A full node has to download the entire blockchain. This takes like a week on a non-SSD hard drive already.
3. Larger block take longer to propagate around the network. The person who found the previous block gains advantage because of this. They know there is a new block as first and can start looking for the next one. Others are still mining the old one until the latest one reaches them.

Even if you believe in the tech, the tech alone won't defend itself. There is still a lot of space for bad actors to pull shady shit and the community needs to do its part in defending the tech.
Do not underestimate social media. If you run a Bitcoin business, your reputation is everything. It is a proven fact Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, etc. drive consumers to and away from platforms and companies have no choice but to care about what people say there and try to avoid negative PR. Talking shit about companies linked to the people trying to attack Bitcoin works.

It's really hard to make a proper estimate with irrational spikes like last weekend BCH pump and dump. Even the 'smart fees' look behind a week so the High and even Normal level was a bit off to the high side this week. The fee estimation algorithms only really work well if transaction processing times stay the same or change slowly.

Agreed, get a Trezor, make accounts with 2 different passphrases, transfer however much you think you can handle selling to the first one, keep the rest in the other. Then show the first one to your wife, discuss how to progress with her. If she is okay with selling 20% or so and keeping the rest in BTC she is a keeper.

chances are they passed the BTC on to their liquidity provider who failed to deliver
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:47:33
Again, I only have a Trezor so I will speak about Trezor.


you can have 2 Trezors with the same private key. if one breaks, you can use the other.


you get a 12 to 24 word 'seed' and you can use that seed to load your private key into another Trezor any time.


Trezor has no battery, all its power comes from the USB. it has 0 power while not connected so that should make things pretty safe but yeah, it probably won't last 10,000 years because of gamma rays and stuff.

No, BTC is not on the same boat BCH. BCH was the attack vehicle used for last weekends pump and dump which caused a spike in BTC confirmation times and fee estimates.

Bitcoin Core is open source software. Somebody from Trezor or Ledger could write the support instead of pumping their bankrupt shitcoin bags.

The inflation arguments are kinda flawed tbh. Sure the value of 1 dollar has gone down by X but the M2 has gone up by a similar ratio. There are more dollars to be had than before.
Inflation is an inherently anti-incumbent, anti-establishment, anti-rich-people thing. It forces them to take risks with their money to keep their wealth. As young, up-and-coming, risk-taking guys, you should be happy for inflation.
Bitcoin made sense in 2009 because of the massive QE experiment. But it's 2019 now, the experiment worked and the Keynesians have won.

It wasn't as much of a weapon against the banks, more of a hedge against QE. It's not a coincidence the BTC bubble popped the moment Powell took over from Yellen marking the end of the "let's just print more fiat" era.

Everyone affected should report Visa to the CFPB and possibly get started on a class action lawsuit as well. It is obvious this is a malicious action by Visa to discourage consumers from buying crypto. Don't believe the whole "ooops, it was a honest mistake" narrative.

This is most likely a scam. Unless you see an unconfirmed transaction in your own wallet, nobody sent anything to you.
@_date: 2017-10-11 20:45:53
Because you can split B2X from BTC and sell it on November 20ish. If somebody else holds your BTC, it can take months until they give you access to that B2X. Coinbase didn't give people their BCash yet, and it's been like 3 months. If you withdraw BTC after the fork, they can be no longer split. Only the account (private key) that held them at the time of the fork can split them.

Hey guys, can somebody answer this? Let's assume the fork happens and F2Pool and SlushPool are the only important miners left. Let's say total hashrate drops to 10%. Would this mean new blocks will take 10 times longer to make, so about 100 minutes? Or would it be longer? How much longer? 100 times? 1000 times? Assuming the 10% of current hashrate.
Basically, does difficulty scale linearly, or exponentially?

It doesn't necessarily have to be the Chinese government right now. Maybe Bitmain really want to take over the Bitcoin open source project just to have more control over it themselves and make changes as they see fit. But you know anytime in the future the Chinese government gets involved, Bitmain will fold and do whatever they say, because there is not really another option besides having their business confiscated and getting executed.
