Don't you even try to start flamewar on distros ^ ^
Most original distros are using vanilla (or in case of frozen versions of packages - backported important patches). Choice is always given, but it's clearly the easiest to be made in gen2. But default is vanilla ffs -.- If this was for example funtoo or other derivative i wouldn't care because it's in the nature of derivative to monkey patch things with some batshit insane code

Non-vanilla shouldn't be default… unless it doesn't work at all without some patches which clearly isn't the case

Non-vanilla is more important than that IMHO (when it comes to packaging)
Though i would probably have nothing against such patches being enabled by some flag (disabled by default, properly described). I think it would be a great trap for ricers ^ ^

I find this question disturbing as it is gentoo based, so any possible incompatibilities are resolved at compile time…
But it isn't like chromeos comes with bitcoin -.- same for gentoo anyway

And expecting that an user will read EVERY ebuild on every update in order to get vanilla¹ experience is just wrong -.-
¹That ofc may be not so important for ChromeOS users
