Oh I thought you were serious at first.

What do you mean by a chargeback?

I was having problems earlier but my deposit just went through so check btc-e again.

Same problem for me.

It seems to be back up now.

Thanks!  I will probably try using coinbase since I was looking into that a few days ago.

I would definitely recommend downloading Bitcoin-QT or another client.  That way your wallet would be stored on your computer and you will always have access to your coins even if coinbase goes down.  Just make sure to backup your wallet file onto a flash drive just in case your harddrive dies.  
You are correct about needing to have the online wallet to get the coins (As far as I know.)  Think of Coinbase and MtGox as currency exchanges; you send them money, and they turn it into bitcoins.  These coins stay on your coinbase account until you send them to your wallet address, which will be created when you install Bitcoin-QT or another client.  
With Bitcoin-QT, you can create several addresses so you can keep track of where funds are coming from.  I have an address for coinbase transfers, a gambling site, and several other random things.  All these addresses are connected to the same wallet.
Btw, if you're using Bitcoin-qt, it's going to take a very long time to sync with the network, this is normal.

I'm fairly new to bitcoins myself so I'm not exactly sure. I do know that if your wallet is somehow deleted, those bitcoins are gone forever unless you have a backup.

I've been having the same problem.  I wasn't getting the text, and my phone can't receive calls.

You don't need to do anything.  I use Bitcoin Qt myself and it takes a VERY long time to sync but once it's up to date just keep it open.  I think this actually benefits the bitcoin network but I'm not positive.

How did you manage to screenshot that?  I only saw it for about a second.
