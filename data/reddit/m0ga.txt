i can sense great knowledge beyond my understanding with this comment.

Jesus all I asked for was an educated guess on when mempool would clear up and I’m getting in depth responses to everything but that . I thought about screen shoting the fee for you, but... that would help me.
@_date: 2019-07-19 04:33:38
correct, lots of tiny imputs. not necessary but should be done. anytime yes, but, the sooner the better.
@_date: 2019-07-19 04:44:11
20$ is minimum, no custom fee option. no rbf option. sooner the better cause i do lots of transactions and would have saved a load of sats if i moved to segwit a year ago. thought id stop being lazy today and move it, but mempool full. ty anyway

Finally, a expert bitcoin analyst with understanding of the mempool and trends of the market.

Tks, good to know. I guess that explains it
@_date: 2019-07-19 04:52:31
not all wallets can do this. i wish mine could
@_date: 2019-07-19 05:49:00
Guess I should consider the seed, but I heard somewhere it’s better to send it as a transaction
@_date: 2019-07-19 04:31:19
not this. want to move to new wallet

I can see the BCH in his eyes /s

Is that same as the state of Hawaii? I should know exactly what to say like that if given the opportunity.
@_date: 2018-05-28 01:17:29
This makes me happy. I want see the r/btc version of this

Did u ever see a lawyer to make a will? After that it seems like the easiest way, just put the 12 words in a safety deposit box. Taxes on that inheritance though is an interesting thought

If you were a vendor and had to eat losses from credit card fraud you might want to use bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 08:37:43
Are you planning on mailing the money to an address first? Or are you telling the internet a place to meet you where you will have $2,000 in cash? 
@_date: 2018-05-01 06:38:02
In that case I’m surprised how well he covered his ass. Still looking forward to see the outcome of the bitconnect thing
@_date: 2018-05-13 08:29:01
I do both, for example, when I have the option to use 5$ worth of crypto, I buy 10$ worth, use half and hodl the other half. 
@_date: 2019-10-05 05:41:34
Coinbase raising fees by a slight 3x
@_date: 2019-09-17 12:51:07
I’m guessing it’s the seed that was compromised. Care to share any details on that?
@_date: 2019-09-07 04:55:35
How about kraken? I got an account from Hawaii. Just don’t want to pay the stupid high fees so haven’t used it yet
@_date: 2019-09-17 13:01:08
24 words you wrote on a paper and someone found it.. or maybe put in a cloud where someone hacked it?

I know right! Roger can try all he wants to censor btc, but bch will fail. Hopefully bitcoin.com gets shut down for censoring btc.
