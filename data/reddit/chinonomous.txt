I used to buy games all the time on  then they recently stopped accepting bitcoin. I messaged them and they said they were not accepting it at least for now and told me they still accept paypal and credit card.

They won't auth you or even reply I wasted my time with them also. Try coinbase, I had my first purchase within an hour of signing up.

After reading [this thread]( I decided to check for weaknesses in my security and was going to disable teamviewer or secure it with windows login. In the settings I found a button to activate 2FA. I recently went through all of my accounts and activated 2fa on any that offered it but completely forgot to check the biggest open door in my setup. One glaring mistake could undo all of the hard work we do to secure our systems. If you bother to use 2fa and don't on teamviewer, you are potentially leaving all of those other accounts wide open.

If you add a credit card to coinbase it is instant. I get the bitcoin within a few minutes and the cash comes out of my bank in a few days. They hold the credit card in case it doesn't go through. Maybe you can add your debit card or a gift card to unlock instant.

I don't think nfc is strong enough to go through the metal back. Those are to make the tags work when you have them *on* metal, not through it.  
Maybe a glass backed watch would allow you to scan through it.

Same here. I am not going to jump through hoops to give them my money. I guess coinbase will continue to get my business. I only tried signing up with circle because they take mastercard and I have a bunch of money in Gwallet.

Done. I did both. Funny I am 99% a bitcoin user and found this link from the thread in r/dogecoin

Now that is one cheap BJ. I might have turned that one down. just saying.

Maybe too much metal mass blocking the signal. In which case those ones posted above may work.  As long as they aren't any bigger and still fit inside that is.

You are showing your friend's name and number in that picture. If you want to do him a favor you should delete and edit it out.

Coinbase takes a few minutes if you use instant.
@_date: 2014-11-07 02:50:18
No problem, and thank you. I can't wait to see the results of both.

That's silly. If someone gained this much access to your computer they could do the same to a person that only used banks/credit institutions. I could post my bitcoin address online all day and no one could do anything other than send me money. If I posted my credit card or bank number my accounts would be cleared out immediately. The risk of banking is much greater when you think of it as someone else being responsible for your things. People really need to take responsibility and learn to secure the devices they rely so heavily on.

Wow man I didn't expect it to work already but it is perfect now and I find a ton of locations near me. Keep it up, so far you guys rock and I haven't even used you...yet

I would say yes since that's what others are ASKing for their coin. Usually if you place a limit order at ask it will go through immediately if that order is filling.

Thanks for the reply. I tried it from my phone first and got the mobile link to search a zip. I tried a bunch and got zero feedback so I couldn't even tell if the search was happening. I tried again from home on my computer and couldn't even find the zip search. I saw the location tab is different than mobile and it lists 4 cities or something. I searched one of those zip codes on my phone and got some results but it was a confusing mess. Just giving input from my observation. I will for sure check back I like the idea a lot.

Does the location finder work for anyone? I can't get it to do anything.

That sounds nothing like signing up for instant on coinbase for me. Never heard of the $100 thing and didn't have to verify my identity. I attached my bank and credit card and verified two deposits to my bank and two authorizations to my cc. Click buy and had them in a few minutes.
