"Decentralized" can also mean so many things depending on which layer we are talking about for example. Some would say Bitcoin (segwit+eventual lightning) is more decentralized. Some would say Bitcoin Cash is more decentralized because it keeps everything on chain.
At the end of the day, it's utility that we want.

Where's this mythical Yours.org that accepts Bitcoin Segwit?

Not to agree with OP, but on the other hand you can take a guess at who's banking off the thousands percent increase in fees these last few years.

Are altcoins not off topic?
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:49:01
Back then this community was free from drama as well. We all were on board with Satoshis vision and that's why we were so into Bitcoin in the first place.

Yeah lol... It's a pretty outrageous thing to say, but he's been spot on before.

They may not be Brazilian. Better stick with Bitcoin.

Man I don't want to wait that long to use it... Even if it's just one week.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:55:18
I'm going to go very hungry then....

Those projects were stepping stones towards Bitcoin Cash and at least Bitcoin Unlimited is still an actively developed client. 
(some however bought futures in hopes that it would activate and become its own currency, which was pure speculation and never promised... they are now very salty)

I'm seriously rooting for Core team to have smashing success. What's good for Bitcoin is good for the crypto community and market overall.
This is simply an intellectual exercise. Bitcoin Cash supporters did it with Bitcoin Cash recently as well.
@_date: 2017-12-31 11:33:11
That doesn't make the behaviour of the exchange any better.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:30:24
Not sure if this is a pro/anti-Core comment, but for this particular intellectual exercise Bitcoin and Bitcoin Core are off the table.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:43:45
I don't think it will happen entirely either, but no ammount of money will stop the ongoing development. It will be the military that will have to do that. How far will the people in power be willing to push that envelope?

When did you get interested in Bitcoin and what do you think of Bitcoin today?

I'm a Bitcoin Cash supporter _and_ a Bitcoin supporter and I approve this message.

Picking up BCHs all day.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:44:51
No, I didn't have any and I'm not trading at all for the time being. Not even sure where I'd go if I wanted to short.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:25:45
Which was totally predictable. Just look at the recent mempool hights and drops. 
When price rallies more the blocks get full and then the fees rise. When fees rise, so does the valuation (issues aside) of the network and the price increases even more. Only when fees and confirmation times get so high that users stop making transactions do the fees finally drop and also the price.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:18:54
Bitcom has to be by far the most common. (I've also heard some BitcoinCashers call Core BitCon.)
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:16:29
What if someone wanted to sell their BCH at a later time? Now they would have to buy it themselves, pay exchange fees and possibly up drive the price of the coin.
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:35:10
How lucky that they didn't consider altcoins.

No, that's just trolls (which appear on all sides) from the Core side that want to brand him as a "BCash supporter". McAfee doesn't even hold his coins, he just mines and sells for profit, so he doesn't care so much which particular chain ultimately wins out.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:24:45
That's totally fine. I'm enjoying your perspective. =) I'm just mentioning it because the post got downvoted pretty quick and there was much more than just price discussion in the video.
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:53:15
I think we can almost bet on that...
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:03:24
It's possible. If we first retrace a lot so that stop losses can accumulate above and then the futures come online, this could push us to insane hights, or lower too of course.

Net Neutrality is a joke to Bitcoin and mankind. It would get run over if there was a need and financial incentive for it. 
Don't trade Bitcoin (any of the implementations) right now if you don't like high risk. You could lose your shirt. This is how the Bitcoin bear markets have always started. No guarantees, but that's history.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:14:43
Sure. I don't think we'll see 20 before christmas, that's for sure. But as you said, 50 in 2018 is totally possible.
-I want to be clear though, this video was not posted to be only about the price. The entire discussion was rather interesting.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:57:41
This is usually how it starts....
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:18:08
Yeah I got it. Net neutrality still a joke on its own though. But maybe that's what you meant as well.
Edit: What I mean by this is that it 1 doesn't solve the problem 2 creates new issue 3 is not even likely to stay in unless the large companies that stand behind and support it get through their exceptions. Let's just focus on building something better instead.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:21:56
The difference would be that one line of code could change the future of Bitcoin. Coinbase might have to do more than that.

Centralizing power for an involuntary institution to deal with monopoly is not a real solution. Maidsafe type, long range wireless, mesh network, independent energy. That's the route we need to be going.
