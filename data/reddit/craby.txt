Раньше его статус был неопределен. Но законным средством всегда был рубль. Пока, имхо каждый случай отдельно стоит смотреть. Зависит, как юристы работали

 Карты оплаты от моб операторов нет, т.к. их только он сам и принимает. Про остальное потом напишу

Goverments should state their position on btc. My opinion is that btc have it's own usage sometimes very helpfull, but not as global payment instrument.
@_date: 2014-01-27 22:26:44
Central banks supervise banks. So it can control usage of bitcoins by banks. And also cbr control way of payments in russia if i am no mistaken

@_date: 2014-01-27 17:09:40
Why. I think you can use foreign exchange. If anything

The situation with rouble in my opinion has nothing to do with btc.

Сеть баров их принимала и оставляла на счету, не зная что с ними делать (из интервью создателя).

 It'sad that there is no legal basis for btc in russia. Both persons and legal entitys must be carefull working with it. Also btc exchange and accepting btc at shops will be considered at suspicios operations under aml law

Can't comment on this. I like it)

Russia has a very good law on payment systems and e money. Webmoney is working because there is an organisation who can be controlled. And webmoney always has money to insure it's emoney. Thus cbr can protect customers etc. And main of btc is lack of central agent. Actually it's one of the main problems

So basically atm there is no way of directly working with bitcoins for shopkeepers? 
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:26:18
Sad i still have no reasons to buy something with bitcoins. I want it to be currency, not another asset. Really guys let just stop this rolercoasting or we'll kill bitcoin
@_date: 2013-11-11 06:02:49
Yeh, thats the point. If i pay taxes at the end of the year and trate bitcoins at their market value it can happens that i ll pay enourmous taxes. Atm its very likely
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:21:59
Dont regret. It's just your risk pattern. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 21:23:01
I know, that they can receive bitcoins (technically) to their bitcoins. But i am speaking about real possobilities. 
As i realize shop tend to use low exchange rate for bitcoin to hedge the risks of volatility. 
And i thinking how to manage taxation with bitcoins

Do you accept them directly or via some service?
