Yep. To me it seems like Bitcoin is the MySpace of blockchain technology. I don't believe we have seen the Facebook of blockchain emerge yet.


*JOE KENNEDY, a famous rich guy in his day, exited the stock market in timely fashion after a shoeshine boy gave him some stock tips. He figured that when the shoeshine boys have tips, the market is too popular for its own good, a theory also advanced by Bernard Baruch, another vested interest who described the scene before the big Crash:*
*"Taxi drivers told you what to buy. The shoeshine boy could give you a summary of the day's financial news as he worked with rag and polish. An old beggar who regularly patrolled the street in front of my office now gave me tips and, I suppose, spent the money I and others gave him in the market. My cook had a brokerage account and followed the ticker closely. Her paper profits were quickly blown away in the gale of 1929."*

It's a allegory, do you know what an allegory is? 
That story is basically saying that when a market is super frothy and filled with people who don't know jack shit about investing, e.g. the stock market in late 1920s or cryptocurrency now, then you're headed for a bad time.
