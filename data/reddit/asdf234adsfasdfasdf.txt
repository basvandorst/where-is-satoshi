I'm referring to democracy as an abstract example of how people, "vote" for what they want. Also bitcoin does use an indirect amount of force. If 80% of everyone upgrades to the latest client then the other 20% may face compatibility issues. They might be indirectly forced to upgrade if the issues are too much.

It's a basic example.


Yup it does and no it doesn't mean putting people in steel cages and torturing them to death or whatever you think it means.

There is also the possibly that a new cryptocurrencies would integrate bitcoin into it and allow backwards compatibility of some sorts.
Also what I see happening is not a new cryptocurrency but instead that bitcoin will simply get upgraded continually as these new revolutionary ideas/technologies emerge. The important thing to remember is that bitcoin is a de facto democracy. Every person gets a vote and that vote is based on what client you use. If the new client is good, everyone will migrate over. If the new client, however, has serious bugs in it then everyone will refuse to update until the issue is resolved. There is nothing preventing these client updates from including revolutionary new technologies in them.
In the future, who knows what your bitcoin client will include in it or what other technologies will be layered over bitcoin.
