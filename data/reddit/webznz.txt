NFC, BLE, Biometric based tech and all that other stuff inbetween is only identification. Security comes in the form of secret pin codes and passwords.. anything else you are leaving yourself *more* open to fraudulent activites.
Anyway with iBeacon the range is dynamic depending on the settings of the broadcasting beacon. you can have near feild about 0-10cm mid field 10cm - 100cm and so on.

yup, I have been looking into litecoin mining more so than bitcoin because of block difficulty etc it seems abit easier to mine for someone with lower speck rigs.. *if thats the correct analysis.

yea, this is what I would most likely look at once/if I put together a semi decent/affordable rig to mine with currently I am only sporting a old mac laptop which looks to only return something in the realm of a million of a cent per day or some crap like that lol.

Great news, I have only been here a few days but this subreddit has helped me start up my bitcoin wallet, register with bitstamp and my first bitcoin deposit... Also looked into bitcoin mining but not sure thats for me.
