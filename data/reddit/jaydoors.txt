@_date: 2018-01-21 23:57:53
AFAIK A now has a secret which they can use to take all the funds after the old state tx is broadcast.  This exchange of secrets when agreeing the new state is what means old states are not useable:  both A and B now have a secret from each other which lets them take ALL the channel funds if an old state is broadcast.  
That sound right?

@_date: 2016-08-01 16:13:08
I hope so too but I'm not sure they're required for bitcoin to work as a store of value in these circumstances.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:46:51
I expect it will be no different to a normal transaction. Remember the wallet will do all this stuff for you. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:37:01
I suggest you buy apple stock, rather than bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-01-19 09:01:40
You close the channel by broadcasting the transaction - and as it's a normal bitcoin transaction, there will be a fee.  So it depends if you still want to use the channel.  My guess, fwiw, is that if LN becomes stable people will have channels for a long time.
Of course your channel partner could close it too, for their reasons - with the same result.
@_date: 2018-01-15 17:29:23
The basic insight, to me, is that if you hold an unbroadcast transaction that sends you 1 BTC, it is essentially the same as if you actually held the private keys to 1 BTC on the blockchain.  Because nothing can stop you from broadcasting the transaction and getting the 1 BTC.
The advantage is that you can send someone an unbroadcast transaction *without ever hitting the blockchain* - i.e. instantly, for free, as if you were sending them an email.
A lot of the LN magic is in the smart contracts which allow these unbroadcast transactions to work, and hold their value unambiguously (or change them unambiguously when a channel is updated because of a transaction) without needing to actually broadcast them.

To fund your ln wallet you’ll just make a transaction on the main chan
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:00:50
I agree with all this.  Locking up capital is going to be the main gross cost, I would think.  For channels between active hubs this should mean tiny fees per tx, as there would be so many txs.  But it's the 'last mile' that will cost:  if you have a wallet with unused channel headroom, you will have to pay your partner for them to lock up their funds, and as it's only you on the channel, the cost per tx overall will mainly come from that, I'd expect.
@_date: 2018-01-25 08:54:33

Re your edit:  your capacity to read this thread
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:51:29
No, it’s not a company. It’s really a protocol, like tcp/ip or Bitcoin itself, and anyone can make software or apps to work on the ln as long as they follow the protocol. There are at least 3 different groups working on separate implementations afaik. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 08:55:40
Not sure why it would lead to just 1.  In the internet you don't just get one router.  And we already have like 100 in LN, so what's going to make them shut down?  
Also in LN hubs will make money, there will be lots of incentive to offer services as a hub and I expect we'll get competition on fees.  I can imagine other ways hubs might be differentiated too - eg different privacy settings or whatever.


Maybe just opening and closing channels.  But this doesn't really depend on how many hubs there are.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:42:17
LN nodes don’t really have any power- any more than nodes routing packets on the Internet do.  The only nodes that will have power over you is the one you have a channel to. But you can close that and get your funds any time.
Also remember ln is an additional option- it’s not like the main chain is being superseded. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:19:19
Nice triy ;)
@_date: 2018-01-15 17:35:46
The recipients would each control, in their wallet, an unbroadcast transaction for their channel balance which included the 50uBTC (not 75 or 25).  That transaction would have been signed by whoever controls the other side of that channel.  So at any time they can broadcast this transaction to the main chain and get their balance (50, not 75 or 25).  Nobody can stop this.  The channel balances will only change if the recipients themselves sign further unbroadcast transactions to send in the other direction.

This is wonderful- a real service to the community. 
I’d love someone to answer the fees question!
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:31:36
I'm not sure about how the closing fees are managed - it's one of the main unanswered questions I have in my mind.  The unbroadcast transactions that hold the balances of the channel 
will, I assume, already have a fee specified, and who pays it.  That's fine as it's all agreed upfront, except if there is uncertainty about what the right fee level will be - you don't want to be prevented from closing a channel because the fee is too low.
So where I got to is that perhaps the best way is to set zero fee, and then whoever wants to close the channel has to pay the whole thing through Replace-By-Fee or Child-Pays-For-Parent.
I'd be amazed if the devs haven't got a plan for this - but I don't know what it is.
Note also these fees are distinct from what you would want to be paid to compensate you for locking funds in the channel, which is what I was referring to before.
@_date: 2018-01-21 17:18:39

@_date: 2019-07-11 21:34:08
But buds, the whole point is that there is an effectively infinite amount more that *could* be mined (if justified by a high enough gold price).  
In the earth's crust alone there is ["somewhere between 28,600,000,000 tonnes and 104 billion tonnes."](  That's 100,000 to 1 million times what has been mined.
Never mind [asteroids]( or the earth's core (which will have orders of magnitude more - as gold sinks).

That level of issue anyway, far from the biggest problem.
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:26:27
Slightly under the hood: the key point is that your 'IOU', as you put it, is actually an unbroadcast main-chain transaction in your favour, which has been signed by your channel partner.  Nothing anyone can do can stop you from broadcasting this to the main chain anytime you want, and getting your funds.
@_date: 2019-07-31 13:23:38
I don't think it makes sense to store trezors.  This is what seeds are for.
You really shouldn't be telling people how much bitcoin you have, or how you store it - particularly as it is a rather unsophisticated approach.  There will certainly be people reading reddit looking for this kind of information about possible targets they can try to track down in the real world.  
There are ways to store bitcoin which can protect against coercion / torture but you don't sound like you have used them.  I recommend you delete your account immediately and think about changing your storage strategy.
@_date: 2019-07-01 17:47:16

@_date: 2019-07-11 18:55:21
Except there's probably about 10x as much paper gold as real - and this sets the mkt price.  So all that shd be 10x.
@_date: 2019-07-01 17:43:51
Gold mkt cap of $7tn puts bitcoin at about $350k I think (dyor). Bitcoin is objectively more valuable in every relevant way so it seems reasonable to me that this should be a lower bound for where things will end up if things don't go dramatically wrong.  
All that can be said about how we get there is that it won't be smooth.
@_date: 2019-07-11 21:47:41
More [here]( for ya buds:




You are of course right that it is not economical to mine this - but that's exactly my point:  however much the gold price increases, there will **always** be more gold that can then be economically mined, thereby increasing supply.  Price goes to $2000 / oz?  Mine more surface.  Price goes to $2m per oz?  Start thinking about asteroids.  Price goes to $2bn per oz?.. 
Of course the mere fact that these huge resources exist mean that such price rises are extremely unlikely, precisely because they can be brought on stream, if the price justifies it.  And this *price-elasticity of supply* is the case with essentially every other earthly commodity - except bitcoin.
See what I'm getting at?
@_date: 2019-07-12 16:49:10
I don't think it's exclusive to HD wallets. 
The address would already "exist" as a number in the range of possible private keys (from which the public address is derived) even if created in isolation.
@_date: 2019-07-11 19:59:33
We have the internet now.  I give it 3 years before bitcoin market cap &gt; gold.
It is difficult to overstate just how much better bitcoin is than gold, in all the qualities which make gold valuable.
Take one, scarcity.  Gold demand increases, price goes up, it means some of the previously uneconomic sources of gold can now be mined - so supply goes up.  The total possible supply of gold is effectively infinite.
Bitcoin demand increases, supply does not.  This is inelastic supply and, apart from unique objects like Picasso paintings (which are not really relevant), it is completely unprecedented in civilization.
The mkt cap of gold is a very extreme lower limit on the eventual mkt cap of bitcoin.

In a word, network effects.   No point in having &gt;1 global currency.  As soon as people realize which one is winning, they converge on that one - which increases its dominance.
This happened in crypto as soon as bitcoin was invented.  
Alt coins are almost entirely pointless in principle, and completely pointless in practice.  Important to understand that just because something is listed on cmc and has some reported mkt cap doesn't mean it's real.
Only way bitcoin doesn't win is if it is fucked up in some way that cannot be retrieved - eg by bloating the blockchain so it can't be used permissionlessly.

Very likely at some point.  Worth bearing in mind, though, that govts have a long history of banning currencies.  It doesn't usually work, because the currency they try to ban is usually 'better' than the one they issue themselves - and people will find a way.
It will be interesting to see what happens if bitcoin or other crypto gets widely used by the public before govts try to ban it.  Eg apparently coinbase (app for buying bitcoin) was apparently the number 1 downloaded in the apple store last weekend.  So if millions of people own some bitcoin, it's got to get difficult to ban. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:50:28
Well we already have one - segwit.  Major users have to stop wasting block space and use the tools available for reducing fees, rather than just raise the blocksize to let more waste onto the network.
@_date: 2019-07-11 21:12:10
Yeah that's a guess.  But I bet it's a lot - and really any significant proportion would prove the point, imo.  Also, you can't easily separate gold being used as SoV and eg jewellery.  Industrial uses you can I guess - so that would be something of a test.
A better test tho, to my mind, is to ask what would happen to its value if all gold's practical uses were superceded by something else?  I'd expect very little.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:46:21
You need a compatible wallet, and then send to a segwit address.  But I wouldn't worry about it if you're just hodling, rather than doing lots of transactions.
The real issue is people like coinbase, who do huge numbers of transactions - and yet don't use segwit.

It’s pretty easy to work out a fee that will get you in yhr next block or two for sure. It’s harder knowing how low you can go and still be sure it gets in in a day or so. Look out for the satoshis per byte - i expect electrum says this somewhere.

@_date: 2017-12-15 08:35:16


There's something missing here.  The fact is there is only 1 tx fee per channel, so that difference must come out somewhere.  Eg imagine a channel was opened once, and traded 1000x.  Fundamentally there is only 1 fee, not 1000.
I suppose the way this would probably work is, OK you perhaps pay the tx fee as part of the price for buying the channel.  But you will be able to do the same when you sell it so you aren't ultimately paying anything (except locking up a little bit more capital).

To my mind it would be completely wrong to raise the block size as long as people are not using block space efficiently.  
Segwit is only at 10%.  That means people are *wasting* precious block space, and paying unnecessary fees, just because they don't yet have their shit together.
So if we just raise the block size, they won't have to bother - and they'll go on wasting block space and adding completely unnecessary weight to the blockchain.

It has all the best devs, it seems.  And segwit on btc enables lots of cool tech that bcash can't have.
But more importantly the lack of meaningful constraints on transactions is, imo, a fatal flaw.  If bch ever got popular it would likely be impossible, given its history, to resist demands to keep increasing blocksize to keep fees close to zero.  That means, effectively, allowing anything into the blockchain, including low-value 'spam' etc.  It also means nobody has incentives to make their use of blockspace efficient (even with current btc fees, this isn't really happening, it seems, as there is relatively low segwit use).
A bloated blockchain (which is too large to maintain in a properly decentralized way) is about the only thing that can actually kill a cryptocurrency - as there is no way to reverse it.

Because of the transaction fees it would cost to open a new channel.  (And the fees to close an old one, which could be kept open and sold).
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:22:31
Gonna paste here a comment I made elsewhere which is my opinion on this:
**The purpose of fees in protecting bitcoin**
Fees serve an important purpose in bitcoin: making sure block space is used efficiently, and ensuring that the network of nodes can continue to maintain the blockchain and process transactions in future. This is vital for the survival of bitcoin as an independent, decentralized system.
Everything that is written in the blockchain must be preserved and curated by nodes for as long as bitcoin exists. Every new transaction must be checked by nodes against the blockchain history to ensure its validity. That all takes resources, especially bandwidth and processor power. Nodes provide these resources for free. Without them, bitcoin would stop working. The fewer independent nodes there are, the easier it is to attack or shut down bitcoin.
So it's vitally important to ensure that blocks and the blockchain don't grow to the point where running a node takes too much resources. Once the blockchain becomes too bloated for a network of independent nodes to operate, it will be impossible to go back. Bitcoin will fail. A bloated blockchain is really the only threat that cannot be defended against by changes in software - because the blockchain is bitcoin.
That's the reason for limiting the size of blocks - and for being extremely cautious with any increase in block size. The natural consequence is that people must pay fees to get into blocks. This means the transactions of the highest priority - which people are willing to pay most for - are included in blocks. Lower priority transactions, which people aren't willing to pay for, are not included. Fees mean users are incentivised to optimise their use of the blockchain - and to make the most efficient use of precious block space.
**Are fees too high?**
This is a difficult question. Everyone wants fees to be as low as possible, and blocks to be as large as possible, while still ensuring the decentralization and security of bitcoin. But it's not clear what level is "right".
However there are some indications that the current level of fees is not yet incentivising efficient use of block space - and that strongly argues against an increase in block size.
For example segwit reduces the fees users must pay and the burden put on nodes, without any sacrifice of speed or security. And yet only a minority of transactions use it. There are also other examples that show major users have not yet been incentivised by current fees to optimise their use of block space. A significant proportion of block size is therefore currently 'wasted', by users making transactions that take up more space than necessary.
If we want to make sure block space is used efficiently, we need to allow time for the bitcoin economy to adjust to increased fees by using the available tools to reduce the fees they pay, and the block space they use. Increasing block size before this happened would mean users had no incentive take the steps necessary for optimising use of block space - and the blockchain would continue to be bloated with transactions which are larger than they need to be.

Each miner is going to select the set of transactions that give the most total fees for the 1Mb block they are making.  
That's going to give basically the same result for every miner, as they are all picking from the same set of possible transactions.  So your transaction is competing against other transactions to get into that 1Mb.

Most people probably think they will try all things.  But bitcoin was built by geniuses using unbreakable math, and it grew up in the sewer.  So we'll see who wins!
Welcome!  [Here's]( a bunch of resources to find out about it all.  I particularly recommend videos of Andreas Antonopoulos.  If you buy bitcoin, look after your seed.  The whole point about bitcoin is you take responsibility for yourself.  Also remember that the price has crashed by 80% five times - it's normal.

Yes, they could sell it. The price would go down a bit. Though if there is no other change you’d expect this to be rapidly reversed- as Bitcoin would have the same underlying value as before. 
That’s all that could happen.

Apart from anything else, LN will take a huge amount of activity off the blockchain, and so reduce fees hugely.
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:35:38
The first.  Otherwise you're right it would be pretty (though not completely) pointless.  
If it's only one channel, you're describing a 'bidirectional payment channel'.  The major point of LN is that it hooks up bidirectional channels into a **Network**, so you can route to anyone else connected, just like in the internet.

Hi.  [Here]( is my way to answer this general question, and explain what is going on with block size and fees (which is closely related).
Also see [the parent post]( to that comment.
@_date: 2017-12-16 09:53:16


If you mean a crypto-&gt;crypto exchange like shapeshift or changelly, then yes - you get a transaction on both blockchains.
If you mean a fiat exchange like Gemini or Bitfinex, then no - they will keep a private database, and the only transactions required are when you deposit to the exchange, or withdraw from it, as you assume.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:36:17
Agreed. But their choices are relevant when considering whether to raise the block size - and allow more of this waste onto the eternal ledger, to be maintained in perpetuity - or to leave time for economic incentives to take effect. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:15:32
It depends what you mean by wallet, really.  A wallet is software for storing keys and composing transactions using them.  You can have access to the same keys from different devices (and different pieces of software).  Whether that's still 'one wallet' or two wallets doing the same thing isn't clear (or particularly meaningful).
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:31:50
I’m not making a proposal to do anything. In fact I propose we do nothing. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:37:19
OK.  Seems higher than [this]( would imply (for a normal tx).  But I think the core algorithm is based on 95% confidence which might explain the difference.
Also  which I believe uses the core algorithm, is currently estimating $16 for a standard tx.  Which presumably means yours is not standard (i.e. has more than 2 inputs and outputs).

It's much more than 'a psychological effect' - any difference between the two markets will create arbitrage opportunities, such that the difference is reduced and the prices converge.  So they're really one market in terms of the price of bitcoin.

It seems to me that what you're suggesting boils down to reducing the amount of bitcoin mined in future.  As you point out, this would reduce the security of the network.  I'm not sure what the benefit would be (other than increasing the value of currently existing bitcoin, to the extent there will be fewer in future).


Well it's not!  The amount of resources spent to mine 1 BTC will always tend towards 1 BTC.  So - leaving aside changes to the amount of BTC to be mined - the $ price is all that matters in determining bitcoin's usage of energy (measured in $), and that's effectively external to all this.  Unfortunately I don't think we can realistically expect infinite prices, so we will not have an infinite arms race of investment in mining.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:44:58
"Eventually", sure.   But as I said before, I think, if we did it now it wouldn't just be 'one small one'.  Fees would rapidly increase again to the same level and everyone would be like 'just one more small one'.  I can't see that as a solution, especially when so much blockspace is being needlessly wasted.
Also bear in mind tech has moved on since the whitepaper.  'Channel factories' are likely to mean far fewer on chain transactions are required to open and close channels, which would change the calculations you quoted. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:29:04

@_date: 2017-12-11 22:58:08
Good question.  I think that bitcoin will be different because:
- there is a clear difference between bitcoin you actually own, and bitcoin your bank owns.  As soon as it becomes apparent banks are doing fractional reserve, people will take it out - because then can.  
- fractional reserve banking might lead to a one-off increase in the bitcoin money supply.  But inflation needs permanent growth.  For fiat currency this is ultimately driven by govts deliberately printing money (in effect).  Bitcoin doesn't have that underlying engine of permanent growth in supply.

It looks like you may have paid too much.  Transactions seem to be clearing at 200 sat/Byte - which is about $10 for a standard tx.
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:01:13
What really matters is the individual mempools of the miners, I suppose.  But you can't see these.  
I think the main differences will be the low value transactions that will be dropped by different nodes at different times - so if you're concerned about transactions that are actually getting processed (and what fees they have), I think it probably doesn't make much difference what mempool you look at.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:58:26
Yes, same principle.  But in this case the downside of not improving efficiency (the 'negative externality') is potentially much larger, in my view.
Also if there was a blocksize increase now, it would make it much harder to resist one in future.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:43:04
Basically the deals made in the futures market will have an implied price of bitcoin.  If this gets out of line with the actual price of bitcoin people can make risk-free profits - effectively by buying where the price is low, and selling immediately where the price is high. As the other guy said.  And this will tend to keep the two in line.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:08:30
Ah!  
Basically the deals made in the futures market will all have an implied price of bitcoin - it doesn't really make a difference that they're not trading the real thing, they're still making bets on the *price* of the real thing. If this gets out of line with the price of bitcoin in other markets and 'real' exchanges, people can make risk-free profits - effectively by buying in the market where the price is lower, and selling immediately where the price is higher. This will tend to keep things everywhere in line - as prices are bid up or down, depending on which was lower or higher.  
Google 'arbitrage' if you're not familiar with the term.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:14:25
Data in excess of what is needed to make the transaction is clearly of zero value. 
Whoever is making the transaction will determine if it is low value- i.e. if they are not willing to pay more than whatever you define as a low amount. It’s a relative term.

There is a respectable argument which says you will be able to do everything on bitcoin, so everything else will disappear.  Don't think I necessarily agree, but it's a definite possible future.
The vast majority of recent and current new coins are basically scams whose only purpose is to make money for their founders.  That's not to say they won't be valuable in future, but I'd say you'd want to understand, for any given coin, why it exists before putting confidence in it.

It is inconceivably improbable that this would work. The number of possibilities is far larger than the human mind can comprehend. The likelihood of ever guessing a private key or seed is indistinguishable from zero, no matter how much computing power you use.

@_date: 2017-12-08 18:30:04
Well, the only way for fees to be zero is to have no limits at all on block size, and to accept absolutely any transactions anyone wants.  So if I decided I wanted to broadcast, let's say, a billion transactions of nonsense, or sending a satoshi to and fro, then they would all get mined into blocks and preserved and maintained *for ever* in the blockchain.
Obviously it would kill bitcoin if absolutely everything was included in blocks, as blocks and the blockchain would get so big nobody could run a node.  (Probably more relevant, as soon as blocks start getting bigger, it gets steadily more expensive to run a node - and less people will do it, making bitcoin easier to attack).  Note that this would probably be irreversible.
So zero fees is bad - we need to have some limit on the number of transactions, and that inevitably means fees above zero.
How much above zero?  How big should blocks be?  I'm not qualified to say.  There's obviously a trade off here, as we want blocks to be as big as possible without risking decentralization.  But imo we absolutely must be cautious, because if we do lose decentralization, we lose everything.  So we need to try lightning - which is a way to get the best of all worlds, if it works out.   
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:39:45
That’s just silly 
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:42:41
Yep.  Point is, if you hold an unbroadcasted transaction that gives you x bitcoin from someone, that is worth x bitcoin even if you don't broadcast it.  Because nobody could stop you broadcasting it when you want.
I think a channel can be funded in any way - i.e. including by one participant only.  This is probably how it will work for most people:  deposit in a LN wallet, and then make transactions from it.
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:41:01
You are hugely underestimating the difficulty.
There is a lower limit on the amount of energy required to encode a bit, which is defined by the laws of physics.  So it doesn't matter how fast your computers are, it is not possible to do computations which use less energy than this limit.
What you find is that even just *counting* to 2^256 requires more energy (that's energy, not power) than is contained in billions of galaxies.  You'd have to capture all that.

Well for starters what if you aren't allowed to use R3?  Which most people in the world won't be.  Or if you want to pay someone in a different currency?  Or if you aren't in the US?  Or if some sherriff in Massachusetts decides what you're doing is immoral?  Or you want to keep your wealth in something which won't be inflated by future decisions of people you can't influence?  Or you don't want your payees selling your financial information to someone else?
Or you don't trust the banks who fucked the world over and got away with it and are presumably fucking it over again in some new way we haven't found out yet?
R3 is just the existing system with a bit more efficient internal processes.  It is not a competitor for bitcoin any more than the existing system.

I just can't see that giving anyone what they want.
All other coins will face this issue if / when they get as big as bitcoin.  The only way they win is if we fuck bitcoin up, and they learn from that.  And the most likely way by far I see to do that is to set off on a series of block size increases without even waiting for economic incentives to result in basic efficiency improvements.   Overloading the blockchain is about the only irreversible mistake we can make.

I'm curious about that too.  In particular how the fee is arranged for the closing transactions - which must be updated in the 'commitments' exchanged when each LN transaction occurs.  I assume that if either party doesn't like the fee being proposed in an update, they have the option of closing the channel, using their last commitment.  But what if that fee is not enough?  Can one party use RBF to pay a bit more and force closure?

But it takes an idiot to do that rather than first make sure blockspace is being used effectively.
Segwit is at 10%, which means people are *wasting* space on the blockchain and paying fees that are higher than they need, because they haven't got their shit together yet.  
If we just raise the block size we destroy the incentive to use precious block space efficiently.

For example, the main active use of monetary policy (in an open economy - i.e. which trades a lot, which most do) is a way of imposing a pay cut on your country's workers.  You get (relative) inflation, which reduces the real value of wages and the prices of your exports.  Assuming they were too high before, that allows them to become competitive internationally, get more exports.  Most economists would say it's what Greece needed (needs), but couldn't do because it had no monetary policy levers.  Most countries have a boom when they leave a fixed-exchange rate system for this reason - they can depreciate their currency and get more exports.  
For that matter, any country in the euro could exercise the type of policy you're describing now.  But I'm sure none of them (apart from Germany I guess) would say they had any monetary policy levers.

@_date: 2015-12-02 12:14:51
In principle I don't see why you couldn't devise some algorithm that used oracles (GDP, employment, whatever) to automate a monetary policy formula.  Like central banks do, but with explicit rules that people can accept using the network consensus mechanism of bitcoin.  Central banks are actively considering this kind of thing I believe (though probably without the network consensus decisions on the formula).
Obviously lots of practical problems.  But in the long run I don't see why not.
However this would be very different from bitcoin etc - even if it's decentralised and free of direct human decisions.  Most obviously because it couldn't be global, as monetary policy isn't that useful (even for people who think it's useful at all) if you can't use it to target short-term local fluctuations - i.e. in national currencies/economies.  This is the reason the euro will probably fail - it is too  big to be useful for monetary policy, and the people it encompasses are not willing to accept the fiscal transfers (i.e. Germany to Greece) that are inevitable if you have a single monetary formula.
edit:  this could maybe be done as a sidechain, where a country (or other economic grouping) sets a monetary formula for its sub-coin - basically with programmed inflation based on the oracles etc.  The sub-coin would presumably be directly exchangeable for bitcoin or other sub-coins.  I'm not an expert on the tech tho, so not sure it this is feasible with sidechains.

Yes definitely doable. To check balances all you need is public keys so that’s easy in principle. I know armory (wallet) had an offline version that allowed you to easily export public keys to an online version - I’d expect electrum to do the same but I don’t know. Either way you will want to be totally on top of the details if you do this, so will need research.

For owning bitcoin:  if you use a wallet to store your own bitcoin - which is a good idea, as you don't own it otherwise - take care of your 'seed'.  This 'little poem' is all you need to access your coins, and you can use it to regenerate your wallet on different platforms (or by yourself).  But if it's stolen, someone else can do the same and steal all your bitcoins.

Hmm.  Sounds a bit limiting though.  For example you depend on your channel partner keeping it open - and not charging you fees that are too high (assuming it's a hub).  Also your needs may change - you might want a larger channel.
It's funny, because I'm in the middle of replying to someone on another subreddit who thinks we'll be opening and closing channels every week!  
It just feels to me that if we had a really liquid market for channels, it could enable a whole different dimension of activity without putting weight on the blockchain.  But, as I say, it couldn't work anyway afaik.

 Bitcoin, like other currencies, is ultimately measured against how much actual real stuff you can buy with it.  The USD price is just a proxy for that (ie you can buy $450 worth of actual real stuff with a bitcoin).
If you are trusting centralised bitcoin companies you are probably better off trusting normal banks.  The whole point is with bitcoin you don't have to.
@_date: 2015-12-21 16:26:28
It is against miners' interests to do anything that reduces the value of your bitcoin.  I really think you are worrying too much.  Bitcoin is high risk (and reward) for a bunch of reasons, and you have to be able to accept that.  The one you refer to is, to my mind, not the most serious. 
Another way to think about it:  what else would you invest your wealth in?  Every mainstream financial instrument is *far* more open to abuse you can't even imagine.  One of the many advantages of bitcoin is that any potential for this kind of thing is totally in the open.

Thanks.  I get that idea.  And it sounds great.  But what I still don't get is whether such a system (sidechains in general, not Elements in particular) is intended or envisaged to be used *for real*, as a major part of bitcoin, perhaps dealing with a large volume of transactions, eg PoS as you say - or as a sandbox for testing improvements that could then be moved to the main protocol.  What do you think?
Edit: rereading your comment, it seems to imply this *will* happen for real.  But many people have said things that apparently contradict this - eg in the post I linked above.  And if it does happen for real, why doesn't it potentially solve, for example, the blocksize issue - which I've been assured (by luke-jr no less) is completely unrelated.

I think we have to expand our idea of what bitcoin is to include the layers that are built on the parent chain.  Probably one day getting on the parent chain will be expensive - because it will require the highest possible degree of security and decentralization.  Other layers will be much cheaper and faster (and do much different stuff) - but they are all dependent on the parent.  You are still transacting bitcoin when you use other layers to buy coffee.
@_date: 2015-06-02 21:37:39


But this means that at some time the 1 MB fork would have *some* value.  And the 20MB would have less than full value.  This feels like a quite unstable and undesirable scenario, even if it is short-lived.  But: I really think you don't have to care, *at all*.  As long as you own all instances of a bitcoin across all the forks - their value *must* sum to 1, if you believe only one fork will survive.  You cannot believe chain A will fail without simultaneously believing that chain B will succeed.  You (i.e. the market) cannot hold any views about the probability of success of A without holding exactly the opposite view for B.  Even if views change rapidly, this is constant:  the sum of probabilities must equal 1, exactly - there is no "approximation" involved.  Consider this from the perspective of the total value of bitcoins A and B.  The sum must be exactly equal to the value of whichever emerges (leaving aside the noise and other factors which would shift the total value around anyway - including any general "shying away", as you put it).  Saying it another way:  the value of bitcoin depends on external long term factors - utility for transactions, store of wealth, etc.  If you believe that only one chain will survive, then none of these external factors have changed - and the total value of bitcoin cannot change, even though it is temporarily split across the two chains.
All this means Bob knows he can later sell his 1 BTC for 1 BTC - whether it is his holding on chain A, or on B or, if they are co-existing, on both.  It just depends on him being able to own the utxos of both Alice's transactions.  Here's where my knowledge runs out.  Could wallets be developed that would hold keys for both chains?

@_date: 2015-12-02 13:28:34
Ah I see what you mean.
I still think it couldn't work that way.  Most obviously, what happens if the bank runs out of reserves.  Also I have the feeling, though can't prove it off the top of my head, that the existence of the reserves would mean they were effectively in the economy already - to the extent it will determine the govts borrowing rate etc (if it is the govt).  It's the possibility of actually creating money that affects inflation - which is basically what monetary policy is all about (one way to look at it anyway).  Also there is the issue that building a reserve and locking it up imposes a real cost on the economy.  This could be huge.  If you own the printing presses it's essentially free.
@_date: 2015-06-15 15:15:24
That's such a narrow representation of the counterargument.
It seems to me that the bitcoin main chain simply cannot provide all the functionality required for a global economic network.  That is going to need lightning, sidechains etc - a huge array of applications that will do things we can't even imagine now.  They simply can't all be done on one blockchain - **they have mutually inconsistent requirements**.
What the main chain can (and must) do is provide the anchor for all this.  The *gold standard* which backs all the others.  Crucially, the others can have all sorts of functions and trade off security, speed, decentralisation, volume as required.  But their security all ultimately depends on (and is limited by) the security and decentralization of the parent chain.
From that perspective it seems obvious to me that we should prioritise the security and decentralization of the parent chain.  That doesn't rule out 20Mb blocks (there must be some block size that is too small for the parent).  But I think we should be very cautious - and I also think we should recognise that, if the parent chain is to have this gold standard function, it is likely to have full blocks and transactions will cost.  
Edit: bold for clarity
@_date: 2015-06-08 08:18:14

Not at all.  If you send bitcoins on LN, or some sidechain, *you are still using bitcoin*.  You still depend on the main, parent blockchain, and its security and decentralization.  But you are not transacting on it.
@_date: 2015-06-09 18:07:56
OK - and thanks for reply.  Do you have a leading idea for a kind of vanilla sidechain that could do this?  I guess the main decision is incentivising mining the sidechain [?], which you would presumably want to be fundamentally the same type of ASIC / PoW as main chain.. ..but do you have an idea of what's likely to be the best reward?  Presumably either transaction fees or demurrage (as per whitepaper)?

I don't think OP is really thinking of volatility.  It's the question of if a decentralised cryptocurrency can be used for active monetary policy - or at least if an algorithm can be used (and accepted by the network) to effect a long term monetary formula without central decision making.
@_date: 2015-12-09 03:39:45

@_date: 2015-06-09 18:41:28
OK thanks.  I still don't understand why a sidechain can't basically be an off-chain network that can handle transactions and then settle on the main chain, but with better security than eg changetip.  What am I missing?
@_date: 2015-06-15 18:55:10
We are basically agreeing in the sense that, if increasing the blocksize increases  the security and decentralization of the main chain, then I am all for it.  
But there are trade-offs (which I'm not expert enough to evaluate).  In the long run it seems to me quite possible that a blockchain big enough for everyone's transactions might not be as secure and decentralized as one in which blocks were kept small, and they filled up, and transaction costs were high.  For example, at some point we will need higher transaction costs to incentivise mining (or lose security).  And having one blockchain which everyone uses does not mean we have a blockchain that everyone secures with nodes.  In fact likely the opposite, as a bigger chain means it is more costly to run a node.
@_date: 2015-06-08 19:58:34
Centralization:  in my experience (in 2 disciplines) there is usually a fairly narrow group of senior academics who review papers and (crucially) grant applications.  No grants, no research.  I'm not saying it is impossible to break with the status quo but it can be very hard to get funding and recognition for ideas which fundamentally contradict established consensus - because the people reviewing the grants are usually the ones whose reputations you are threatening to undermine.
@_date: 2015-06-11 16:42:43
Well I guess that if you take the view some of these transactions are spam, and should be deterred for the greater good, and that "real" transactions, whatever that might mean, would pay to get in, then this kind of effect is exactly what you would want.  
All these transactions impose a cost on the network *forever*.  I'm not really arguing either way, but there is at least a coherent argument in principle for actually wanting to delay some transactions forever.
@_date: 2015-06-02 20:12:15


OK thanks, this was the main thing I wanted to know with all this.  So, that being the case, is this not what *will* happen, assuming it is technically feasible?  Eg won't wallets be developed that are fork-independent?  It seems to me this basically nullifies the risk of a hard fork.  I haven't heard that reflected in the general discussion.  Or is there something else? 


Ah, yes, this is interesting!  Suppose the expected probability that A will win is p.  Then the (market) value of 1 BTC in A will be p, and the market value of 1 BTC in B will be 1-p.  The total value of Bob's bitcoin is p+1-p=1 !!
So we have a kind of parallel track development for bitcoin.  The total value will be the same, but it will be probabilistically distributed across the competing forks.  As long as everyone is transacting across both, it doesn't matter.  Miners will ultimately decide which live or die.. ..but is this also a way of enabling more organic evolution? 


Feels like a difference is the common root that bitcoins A and B have?  Eg you can't say anything about the total value of the bitcoin and litecoin, but I feel you can about bitcoins A and B.
@_date: 2015-06-23 17:51:24
Because the tokens on such a ledger would be a good store of value
@_date: 2015-06-02 21:58:54


No, it is logically required, I think.  Suppose you believe there is an exactly even chance that each will win, and your expected value of bitcoin once the chains are resolved is $220.  How much would you pay for a bitcoin on either chain?  [hint: you have to say $110!]  Now vary the probabilities.  You always sum to $220 by definition.
 


Note that they would in fact own 2 bitcoins, one on each chain - though they maybe don't even have to know this.  The value of their holdings will be the value of both.  That gives you your (implicit) underlying price for undivided bitcoin - and, if nothing changes, this would be the price on the single chain that emerges.

OK, so: nobody could stop sidechains being used "for real".  Sounds like you think they *will* be used for real.  This goes against the grain of a lot that I've heard.  I guess the crucial question is how coins on the sidechain will be secured.
Seems to me there are essentially limitless possibiities for where this could end up, and it could get there quickly.  All it takes (iiuc) is for a chunk of mining or other security to devote itself to a sidechain and we may find bitcoin looks completely different overnight.  But, unusually for r/bitcoin, nobody seems to be really that interested or concerned in these possible futures.  I keep feeling I'm missing something!

1. We would want liquid markets in the two coins, to enable price discovery. Shape shift.io? They'd have to be ready  to go as soon as the fork started.
2. Feels to me that constant difficulty across the two chains could be a really useful constraint to force quick resolution.  As soon as the prices diverge, all mining would shift immediately to the most valuable chain, as the other is immediately uneconomic.  You said difficulties start the same: would they stay the same, or could they be set the same by some change in the code?  Otherwise falling difficulty on the losing chain would mean it is still economic to mine - and much more likely to persist.

The business of securities settlement ought to look like a club night with Pete Tong. Just as the DJ and electronic music pioneer stands before a crowd effortlessly manipulating gigabytes of music from a single iPad, the back offices of the world’s financial institutions are supposed to allow traders to switch in and out of trillions of dollars worth of assets without skipping a beat.
In reality, their performance looks more like Rick Wakeman, the keyboardist from the 1970s prog rock band Yes, who would frantically wave his wizard-robed arms as he yanked cables out of a dozen incompatible boxes.
Harmonising the ledgers of the world’s banks requires scarcely less skill and energy. Records of trades have to be compiled and entered into those systems from the phone calls, emails and post-lunch handshakes that constitute the original bargains. Reconciling those trades and ensuring that all parties have the same records is a painstaking business. Electronic trade confirmations help, especially for standardised products, but in many markets paper tickets are still the norm.
Not all failures are as spectacular as those which culminated with Kweku Adoboli of UBS being found with up to $2bn of losses on unconfirmed deal tickets in his desk drawer. But mistakes slip through the net all the time, and cost money when they do. In the US Treasury market alone, about $50bn of trades “fail” every business day, incurring a charge equivalent to 3 per cent interest a year on the delinquent balances. Including private sector markets, the total volume of fails is likely to be in the hundreds of billions.
In the world of stadium rock, the problem of standardisation was solved long ago. You do not see Radiohead’s Thom Yorke posing in front of a huge stack of electronics resembling a telephone exchange, because in 1983 the makers of synthesisers and keyboards agreed on a common standard that lets you plug one into another without an impressive work of amateur electronics.
Financiers may not have noticed, but a technology has been invented that would solve their compatibility problem, too. Its name is bitcoin, although it could probably do with a new one; a whiff of sulphur still clings to cryptographic currencies because of their historical association with anarchists and the customers of the Silk Road online narcotics emporium. Richard Gendal of IBM has suggested that the underlying system should be called “shared ledger technology” instead.
So far as legitimate finance is concerned, the utility of this technology has little to do with its supposed ability to make transactions untraceable — a feature, if that is what it is, which can easily be switched off. It has everything to do with the “blockchain”, a public record of transactions that is updated whenever one person sends payment in bitcoins to another. Every bitcoin user can consult this shared ledger, and any copy is as good as another; there is no uniquely authoritative source. Clever encryption keeps the copies in sync, by making it easy to tell whether one of them has been doctored.
This is exactly what securities settlement needs: a way of recording every transaction once, sharing that record between the counterparties in exactly the same form, and updating in an agreed and standardised manner. It provides an easy way to set up the settlement systems for new or customised products.
It also automatically creates a full, agreed record of transactions, which would assist risk management and compliance functions hugely. And, with such a system in place, it should be straightforward to ensure that netting opportunities are never missed; if one trader sells units in an exchange traded fund and a colleague buys units in the same fund, their institution need not transact with any external parties.
There is the potential for cost savings that go well beyond eliminating mistakes. Back office employees earn salaries into six figures for reconciling settlements and confirming trades by hand. (One of the shameful secrets of financial services is how many people do jobs that could be made obsolete by a small computer program for pasting data from one window into another.)
The biggest obstacle to the adoption of “shared ledger”, of course, is one which has delayed much necessary investment in the past. It is unlikely that the banks will take on bitcoin in its current form, so they will have to agree on the design of a new standard. That means working together and trusting each other. Alas, those are habits that come less easily to bankers than to musicians.

This is really what motivated my questions: myself I would want a wallet that would manage things this way IF there was a persistent hard fork.  If I had the skill I would build one (or realise it was a stupid idea).  Seems to me in general if there are things that can be done in advance (including inter-chain price discovery mechanisms, as elsewhere in this thread) then so much the better. The more reassurance everyone has that bad outcomes will be mitigated, the less likely some of those outcomes are, I'd have thought.  And the preparations could be useful for future hard forks.
Overall I'm no longer sure I really get what is scary about a hard fork.  Mining just has to resolve itself one way or another (particularly because of the lag in difficulty, which self-reinforces the demise of the lower value chain).  If mining resolves, then transactions are presumably OK.  Feel free to disabuse my complacency!

Nothing new about that. Any commercial "quality" brand always has the option of cashing in, (eg by selling out), and making cheap crap for the same price, and getting a windfall profit while their brand value winds down.  
It happens sometimes but not much - which makes me think the economics are stacked against it, and there's more money to be made by maintaining a reputation.  If anything I'd have thought the properly commercial internet reputations would be even more likely to be rationally maintained - as the brand depreciation would be quicker.
@_date: 2015-06-01 15:16:19
Seems to me (and I'd appreciate others views - I'm no expert) there are two main drawbacks.
1. It needs a hard fork and that is inherently a bit risky.  For myself, I think that if we are going to need hard forks at some point, it might be best to go through that now.  But I change my mind all the time - is it better to get bitcoin settled first, so there are wider interests invested in ensuring it works?
2.  More deeply, I think the objections of the core devs are that there is a fundamental problem of correctly incentivising transactions.  At the moment the fees are far lower than the true costs -  not just of making the transaction, but of preserving it for the future so the outputs can be used (spent).  Holders of bitcoin massively subsidise the network, as the value of their bitcoins is diluted each time a miner gets a block reward.  Lots of people think a large proportion of transactions are spam that is enabled by this situation.  From this perspective, raising the block size allows this inefficient practice to continue.  People who take this position think the blockchain itself shouldn't be used for all the transactions everyone wants to make - but that it should be the authoritative settlement ledger, with the bulk of transactions occuring in off-chain systems, such as Lightning, which are much more efficient and better suited to large volumes.  Leaving the blocksize at 1Mb will focus everyone on developing those solutions - which are arguably essential for the future of bitcoin.  For myself I agree this has to be the way things go - but I'm unsure of whether the timing is right to force the issue now.  After all everyone is accepting that transactions are subsidised by mining just now - and I don't see that becoming a really serious problem in the near future.
@_date: 2015-06-22 14:32:29
My general argument for why block size increase should be considered with caution (from prev post):
It seems to me that the bitcoin main chain simply cannot provide all the functionality required for a global economic network. That is going to need lightning, sidechains etc - a huge array of applications that will do things we can't even imagine now. They simply can't all be done on one blockchain - **they have mutually inconsistent requirements**.
What the main chain can (and must) do is provide the anchor for all this. The gold standard which backs all the others. Crucially, the others can have all sorts of functions and trade off security, speed, decentralisation, volume as required. But their security all ultimately depends on (and is limited by) the security and decentralization of the parent chain.
From that perspective it seems obvious to me that we should prioritise the security and decentralization of the parent chain. That doesn't rule out 20Mb blocks (there must be some block size that is too small for the parent). But I think we should be very cautious - and I also think we should recognise that, if the parent chain is to have this gold standard function, it is likely to have full blocks and transactions will cost.

This is what I often reflect on.  In 25 or 50 years time, will any current financial systems still be plodding on when crypto is obviously so superior in *every possible way*?  I can't get there.  
The only question in my mind is to what extent it's permissioned or not.  Permissionless seems very likely to be superior from what we can see now.  So you are left with the global economy running on something satoshi invented - whether bitcoin or another crypto, or some meta-creation.

Can anyone point me to the cumulative probability distribution function [?] for a miner solving a block?  (Eg if they are the only miners, how the prob they have solved a block increases with the number of hashes they have done.)
I'm assuming this is the same underlying function as the probability of guessing a random integer between 1 and N.  Probability after 1 guess is 1/N.  Probability after N guesses is 1.  I can write out the answer as a series (with N) terms, but assume some clever 17th century French person has done the algebra to give a more useful expression.
Many thanks, also for anyone pointing out if my understanding is just wrong.

Thanks for answering.
It also occurred to me that even if an attack on bitcoin were successful, people would switch to another crypto.  If that one was attacked (with a new set of costs), users would switch again.
Seems to me that makes a successful attack on cryptocurrency in general completely implausible.  Any attacker would know that, and that they would be just throwing money away.  Therefore the only motivation for an attack on bitcoin must be to bring down bitcoin *itself*, rather than crypto in general.  That dramatically reduces the scope (and resources) of possible attackers.  The only obvious reason I can see for doing this is to profit from a short position.  Seems very risky, and pretty implausible.

@_date: 2015-06-08 09:54:59
Agreed.  But (and I'm no expert) I think people get caught up in the short term.  If bitcoin is going to be what we think / hope, we are talking about the really long term.  A few teething problems are to be expected - indeed, getting through them is a crucial part of evolving a system that really works.  We shouldn't expect it to be in its full incarnation when straight out of the box.  I think thats part of the core dev opposition to increasing the block size:  it is too early in bitcoin's history to be reaching for the final, complete solution.
Question then gets back to the fundamentals:  will any temporary glitch in bitcoin mean it falls by the wayside.  If you believe decentralised p2p currency is the future, then you end up saying it is either bitcoin or something similar.  So unless another p2p currency overtakes it in that glitch, then we're good.  Doesn't seem to me there are any candidates that are obviously more robust than bitcoin, even during the glitch.

I really think it's better they have this blockchain narrative.  They need simple ways of thinking about things.  The simple thing they think about bitcoin is that it's shady.

Economist here. My advice: don't bother with academic papers, or professional economists - imo most have minds closed by following orthodoxy they learned in a textbook, and which is not inherently wrong but which they don't really understand, so they cannot think about these new things objectively and scientifically. Knowledge is decentralised now, and a crypto expert is likely to understand the relevant economics, esp game theory, better than an "economist" - including me. Get more from a YouTube video or good posters on reddit. I was just watching Andreas at Texas bitcoin conference - worth looking up. Also vitalik buterin.

There's been talk recently of how cheap it would be to attack bitcoin by spamming the blockchain, filling up blocks (outbidding other transactions).  I have the vague notion this would likely just force adaptation - most obviously through fees, but also maybe accelerating off chain alternatives.  And the very possibility of adaptation would be a strong disincentive against attack - as it justs wastes money if doesnt succeed.  Has anyone thought this through, and got more concrete arguments about what might happen? Thanks
@_date: 2015-06-11 08:01:27
Yes I recently started contemplating this.  Eg all this talk of blockchain for asset tracking - it seems to me mainstream institutions might really do this, and in  a big way.  Then you think but what about bloat and block size - can it do all this plus all the normal transactions of commerce.  Maybe not, and what then?  Blocks would fill up with the highest fee paying transactions - and things like financial asset settlements could easily accommodate fees in the range of dollars.  
Bitcoin would be the gold standard, premium ledger for economically valuable transactions - but it would be too expensive for day to day, let alone micro payments.  Is this bad?  It's not what we wanted I guess.  But it does mean bitcoin would be secured - all those fees, all those institutions needing it to work, including, dare I say, government.  This definitely assures it as a store of value, so good if your hodling.  And of course the off chain solutions could potentially be used, in time, to provide the day to day transaction network.  I suppose this is the core dev vision of bitcoin as a settlement network, and a reason not to increase block size.
This is a bit of a mind shift for me, but last night, watching mainstream tv talk about the blockchain, I started thinking for the first time that this really is going to happen - and that maybe it is ok, maybe actually good.

@_date: 2015-06-13 08:52:06
I always find these things work best by starting with the fundamental technology, the block chain ledger, and the fact that this is new in our history: a source of immutable, shared objective truth.  Peoples minds immediately latch on to the enormity of the concept.  Then say one use of an immutable ledger is currency.  They are much more open to seeing how it works and why it is different to other currencies.  Can then also easily get into use for other assets, and smart contracts etc.

@_date: 2015-06-08 20:19:06
They say the "flaw" with bitcoin is that mining is inherently more cost-efficient the more it is centralized - and that therefore it will ultimately be completely centralized, with one big miner, destroying the fundamental attribute of bitcoin.  
What they fail to understand or recognise is that miners are not cost-minimisers, they are profit maximisers.  Even the appearance of over-centralization would reduce their revenues if it was deemed to be problematic.  So you would expect them to avoid this, and that an equilibrium level of centralization would be reached which minimised cost but not at the expense of destabilising bitcoin and threatening revenues.  **This is pretty much exactly what we have seen**.
@_date: 2015-06-15 15:49:51
My point is, *one chain can only do one scale* - and pick one trade off between security, speed, volume, decentralisation etc.
Maybe some applications will want 15s blocks, and need less verification, while others need more.  Who knows what craziness we will see when/if people start doing sidechains for real.  
The common factor in all of this will be the parent chain and it must be secure and decentralised for the rest to work.
@_date: 2015-06-30 12:45:00
I agree.  But hey, this is news, doesn't have to be true right!  The journos don't care.  Will be interesting if this is what lodges in the mainstream psyche from now on:  bitcoin is the thing you buy for a safe haven if your banking system falls over.
@_date: 2015-06-02 19:22:32
Yes that is kind of what I am getting at.  But I'm more thinking of the recipient of the coins really.
Eg Alice gets 1 BTC *today*, when there is a single chain.  Some point in the future wants to send it to Bob to pay for a book.  But there's a hard fork in progress, two clients being used and the blocks they mine are incompatible.  It is expected that one will die out but they aren't sure which.  Alice just wants the book but Bob needs to worry about the transaction going on the wrong chain.  So, question: can Alice say it's OK, I will do two transactions, one with each client, one in each chain.  Both will use the same 1 BTC.  There isn't a problem with double spending because the clients are incompatible anyway (there are two networks and two blockchains).  Whichever chain lives, Bob has his 1 BTC in it.
(Still just questions, I don't know this stuff)
@_date: 2015-06-04 13:14:20
Thanks, understand some of that better now.
On "who will buy new coins on either side", presumably each will be discounted according to the perceived probability of success of the respective sides.  You'd essentially get an insurance / betting market, where speculators/arbitrageurs could take a position on either outcome.  If it was efficient the risk adjusted value should be the same on both sides. Eg if chain A was perceived to have 10% prob of success its coins would trade at 0.1, with coins on the other trading at 0.9.  The prices would adjust as the outcome clarified - until prices were 0 and 1 respectively.  Wouldn't they? And would that not solve this problem? (I guess this assumes the chains *do* resolve. But fixed difficulty is good for that - forcing a solution, rather than allowing difficulty to equilibrate mining across the chains).
@_date: 2015-06-09 08:16:50
It depends what they want to do.  Presumably they would want to kill crypto currencies in general, rather than the one called bitcoin in particular.  If this is the case they will have to be prepared to expend the same resources killing eg litecoin, when activity shifts to that. After they kill litecoin they have to kill doge. And on and on, forever, each time spending huge resources.
So this seems completely implausible and attackers will know this, so they won't throw their money away.
Wanting to kill bitcoin in particular (and not caring if exactly the same thing arises with a different name) is the only remotely plausible motivation for this kind of attack. But who would have that motivation? Short sellers?  Seems highly unlikely anyone would expect to make money this way.

Well you could say that the most important thing in setting up the electricity supply network (aka bitcoin blockchain) is to make sure it provides a sound basis for all the appliances (aka applications) that might be built on it.
US electric supply [actually doesn't - because voltage is too low for some very useful appliances]( - and there's nothing that can be done about that now.
So, *in order to force this analogy to support my current, partially informed view*, I'd say it means:  make sure the parent chain is not a limiting factor on all the applications that could be built on it.  The parent chain defines the limit of security and decentralization - and enables applications (LN, sidechains, whatnot) which can trade off security for things like more speed and volume.  But they will all depend on the security of the parent chain so let's make that the priority.

@_date: 2015-06-15 19:01:04
No, the parent chain secures the applications and networks and sidechains built on top.  It all falls apart without that.  So I'm just saying the security and decentralization of the parent chain are the most important considerations.  That might mean big blocks or not.  But if we prioritise low transaction fees and full access to the main chain we could end up reducing its security and decentralization.

That's part of it.  But ultimately price you pay today is determined by price you expect you can get tomorrow, which is determined by price next day and on and on literally forever.

Thanks for going to the trouble of spelling that out.  It feels to me like that amount of time with fixed difficulty has to be enough to force resolution.  Especially, as you say, because the losing chain will be stuck with the difficulty that is killing it for longer, the more it loses value. Hard to imagine a stable equilibrium there.  I still think price discovery would be important though.
@_date: 2015-06-17 16:17:28
I'm sure we will (if LN, sidechains work).  But my point is that accommodating all transactions on the main chain shouldn't necessarily be the priority.  It seems to me that one day we will likely *not* accomodate them all.  Bitcoin main chain will be the premium ledger, the highest standard of trust and security.  But that all comes at a cost, and seems likely to be incompatible with doing everything that could be usefully done on a blockchain - which we haven't started to scratch the surface of yet.  In this vision of the future, blocks are full and it is expensive to get in them.  That in turn means higher fees and greater security from mining (especially when rewards drop).  But the backing of the premium main chain means all the rest can work - cheaper, probably faster, with a little less security, but still enough.  And then we can have a range of approaches for different needs - different block times, even different monetary formulas (not for bitcoin, but eg a national currency backed by bitcoin that expands supply in a predictable way).  All the asset tracking, and who knows what else.  
All that said, it does seem to me that wallets and offchain systems etc aren't yet sophisticated enough to deal with full blocks and fee-bidding, and the miner reward is pretty huge, so I probably vote for an increase (though I'm far from expert).

Not sure I fully agree.  Eg in your example you'd need your channel partner to want to rebalance, and you'd be at their mercy in terms of hoping they agree, or agree a price for making the reallocation.  Whereas if you could trade channel balances you would be dealing with an extremely deep and liquid market.  Maybe that is possible in other ways though.
But in any case I don't think the things you mention could achieve the result of entering LN without going through a main chain tx - or achieve the tremendous increases in efficiency of main chain use (you can imagine a situation where channels are only ever closed for a punishment - which will presumably be almost never). 
Though it sounds like the 'not feasible' part may be true.

This sounds plausible, but isn't.  Activity would move to another crypto - bitcoin by a different name.  The attacker would have to be prepared to spend the same again on that.  And the next one.  And the next one.  Each time more money, and no chance of achieving their objective.  In the end they have to be willing to buy out the entire global value of crypto transacting forever.

You gotta think bigger.  With bitcoin, anyone with a phone can transact freely (and nearly for free), with anyone else on the planet who also has a phone.  Look at the history of trade - which is arguably the economic history of our civilisation.  Bitcoin is the ultimate solution to trade between humans. 
M pesa shows digital banking of this kind can work, and is needed in places like kenya - but it is nothing compared to what bitcoin can/will be.

I think what they may have been getting at is whether it will be possible to exchange (and trade) LN channel balances.  So if I have a channel with you, can I sell it to someone and then they'll have a channel with you?
This could be pretty amazing for general liquidity, greatly minimise on-chain transactions (why open a channel when you can buy one) and so allow much more efficient use of the main chain.  Would presumably allow much more rapid balancing of capacity.
But I assume it's impossible because the seller would still know the private key of the funding transaction.  (And there might be issues with punishment.. ..I used to have this straight in my head but can't remember now).

Changing the history means creating a new chain - so there will be 2 parallel chains.  Afaik your client will switch to the new one if it has the most accumulated proof of work.  Don't know how it reports that to you but this would be what you'd want to look for.  Might be called a 'reorg'.
@_date: 2018-05-10 12:57:47


I don't understand.  If there's no proof of work it's not a blockchain.


Not in the way you mean.  The difficulty adjusts every 2000 blocks, or something, to a level that would mean blocks are found every 10 min on average.  But the time it takes you to remake blocks depends on your hashpower.  If you have enough, you can do it quicker than 10 min per block, and overtake the rest of the network.


There is nothing to stop anyone altering data in an old block.  But nodes will not recognise it as valid.  To make it valid you have to redo the proof of work.  At that point you will have created a parallel blockchain, different to the one the rest of the network is using.  But if you make it long enough, and make it valid by doing all the proof of work, your chain will be adopted.
So yes, it's very similar to a hard fork - though I don't know if it's technically exactly the same thing

Because I wouldn't need a main chain transaction.  It's not just a case of saving the fees - it could open up a whole frontier of economic activity.  Eg you could sell something directly for a channel balance.  People could go straight in to LN without having to go via bitcoin.  You could also buy channel headroom if you're running out of capacity:  rather than make new channels you can buy existing ones - and you can pay for that with LN itself, so it would be instant.  So the network could rebalance itself second by second.
I don't know, maybe this is nonsense or pointless.  
Thanks, I was aware of channel factories.  IIUC they reduce the need for main chain transactions quite a bit - and seem very cool to my uneducated mind - but not quite the same.

Detailed Q for experts out there.  He talks about stock ownership (and bond and commodity ownership, for that matter) being "dematerialised", and that more stock has been created than actually exists.  This means that each share is actually owned by many people, all of which think they are the unique owner.
I can see how this can happen with eg gold.  You only find out if you actually own it if you try to get it, physically.  But with stocks and bonds, wouldn't this creation of non-existent assets be revealed in payment of dividends?  Eg if a company makes $10 of profits, decides to pay it all as dividends, and returns it to each of 10 shares, they'd each get $1.  But if actually there were 100 shares, because of dematerialisation, they'd get $0.1.  All this must be in the company's accounts.  
Anyone know about this?  Also, anyone know a subreddit that would be into this kind of thing?
@_date: 2014-11-06 11:21:29

u/Trxth is right.  And one way to see this in action is to go to a site like  and make yourself some key pairs.
You can do this all day long.  They are all valid bitcoin addresses which have never been seen or created before, and never will be again.  
But none of them appear on the blockchain until someone sends bitcoin to them, by broadcasting a valid transaction with them as the receiving address.  At that point the address will appear in the blockchain associated with the amount it received.  And those bitcoins can only be spent by someone who can sign a transaction with the corresponding private key.
And don't worry, you won't 'use up' addresses by making them!

1. Nothing, because everyone already knows about it and it will be reflected in the current valuation (i.e. price)
2. This has already happened a thousand times.  (But note there is no obvious reason this is connected to 1, because bitcoins are, essentially, infinitely divisible - in case you didn't appreciate that).
3. Network effect.  One coin is better.  And many of the things you can do different with altcoins now (different block times etc) will probably be possible with things like sidechains that are built on bitcoin.  Everyone knows this, so bitcoin is more valuable.

To make the following blocks valid you'd have to re-do the proof of work on them - in sequence, each using the header of the previous one.

The major problem, imo, with deflationary money supply is "sticky wages".  People (myself included) are just not rational in determining the real value of their wages when prices are changing.
For example, while people might accept - and actually welcome - a 2% pay rise when inflation is at 2%, they might not accept a 2% pay cut when inflation is at -2% (deflation).  Even though these outcomes are materially identical.
If people don't like apparent pay cuts, they can withdraw from the labour market in the hope of getting / keeping their previous apparent wage level.  This causes unemployment.  
The risk is that, if people behave this way, a constantly deflating money supply will cause permanent (unnecessary) unemployment.  This is a major reason why central banks engineer a small amount of inflation.
I usually get killed or ignored for saying this.  So go ahead and do either!

Most people keep their long term holdings offline, and day to day funds in online wallets.  If you take reasonable precautions online, the risks are probably acceptable for day to day amounts.  It's when you have your savings in bitcoin that you definitely need offline storage.
For transferring bitcoin from offline storage, there are a number of options.  Others probably know more (or better), but here is what I know.
I use the armory wallet, which enables very easy offline signing, once it is set up.  So you do the transaction in your online wallet, save a file which you take on a usb stick to your offline computer, where it is signed.  When you return the file on the stick to your online computer it is broadcast to the network.  Sounds a faff but it is really easy.  Afaik armory has the best facilities for this, though my info may be out of date.
I gather the simplest solution is a dedicated hardware wallet, such as Trezor - though I haven't used this.
~~I believe it is also possible to enter your private keys directly to sign transactions on an online wallet.  Eg you have your offline wallet open, view the private key, and type it into your online wallet.  Hopefully others will correct me if there's anything wrong with that.~~
Edit: this might be [a very bad idea](
Overall, I wouldn't worry if you are just starting with bitcoin and playing around with it.  But if you do start saving, I would recommend doing the research yourself, so you are confident in the security.  This is one of the principles of bitcoin - that you have responsibility, and you don't give that away to others such as banks.  It will also make you more relaxed when the price goes to the moon ;)

A little knowledge is a dangerous thing!  IMO he's right, mining is a natural monopoly - two pools could always find some sort of tiny saving if they joined together, be that in admin or whatever.  So the most cost effective way to do mining is in a single pool.
But the pools comprise individuals who are very well aware that if one pool gets over 50% some bad things could happen (and not that bad, as you can't rewrite much of the blockchain).  That's in nobody's interests - particularly as the efficiency gains are going be pretty tiny.  And it has, I gather, proved relatively straightforward for mining pools to sort themselves out in the past to avoid this kind of thing.  It's not like this is a situation that hasn't arisen.
Ironically I (an economist) went through a period of finding out about bitcoin, often thinking I had worked something out (including this) that others hadn't seen because I was an economist and this is really economics.  Each time I found out i was wrong, through r/bitcoin and elsewhere - and bitcoin and it's devs were way ahead of me.  Pity this guy didn't ask about this on reddit before shooting his mouth off, he might have learned something.
@_date: 2014-10-10 19:20:01
Thanks for your considered reply.  I'm not that informed about it, but my understanding was that the gold standard, while not being a "fixed supply" currency, was a currency which did not expand in line with the economy - and that this is one reason it failed, it didn't enable monetary expansion tailored to growth.  Also (and I'm not sure if this was because of gold backing or not) a (the?) leading explanation of the Great Depression was an excessively restricted money supply.  
If all that is true (others will maybe know better), then we have a demonstration of the principle that insufficient monetary expansion causes recession.  For what its worth this is what most pro macroeconomists think and a lot of them are very smart.  I'm not one to accept someone's arguments just  because of who they are, or their title, but they do have arguments.  
You are right to say this is determined by the individual level, and we can use game theory to understand it (still just arithmetic imho).  I haven't got a detailed proof of this, but it comes to mind that it will be rational for individuals to, for instance, collude to maintain high wages (through collective bargaining) even though this may be worse for society overall.  So my argument would certainly be based on the premise that we should consider how individuals act.
Which brings me to your last question of how this would be chosen.  With brilliant irony, it seems to me this would be through the new democracy of the blockchain.  Nodes, or whoever (individuals), would effectively vote on a proposal to implement an expansionary monetary formula.  If 51% agree, it happens.  First past the post democracy.  One of the many mindbending dimensions of the blockchain, for me.  We are implementing a system of direct public choice.  The thing is that with the blockchain there is no agency in the middle.  If we (50%+1) want a monetary expansion formula, we get it - and we know exactly what we get.

"..never sell it" *at any price?*  This is what it would take for there to be a shortage in the sense that people who wanted bitcoins couldn't get them.
It partly depends on your meaning of shortage - but most meanings have to include some notion of price.  Right now there *is* a shortage of bitcoins at $10.  Plenty of people want them at that price, but they can't get them.  There is, however, no shortage of coins at $400.  Etc etc
@_date: 2014-11-12 18:29:13
Yes, *eventually*.  And that will fix things, as the workers would have to hire on at the going rate, ie lower - so the wage cut will have happened.  
It is this lag period, before they go bust, when the problems arise.  But I'm too knackered atm to think it thru!  Sorry!
Edit:  OK I thought about it.  The problem is workers getting hired on at the lower rate.  In a country with a very flexible labour market, like the US I guess, this may be quick.  People need to eat, and will pretty quickly accept they won't get a job at their previous wage.  But eg in some countries in Europe, there are lots of reasons this happens slowly.  There may be generous unemployment benefit, which means the need to get back to work isn't so pressing.  Also the incumbents who have jobs aren't going to like people being hired on at lower wages to do the same thing, as it puts pressure on them to accept a cut, so they are likely to do what they can to stop it - for example through union action.  There may even be legal barriers to companies hiring at lower wages.  Also there may be fixed, one-off costs of hiring someone new that create a barrier.
In general, the more flexible the labour market, the lower the lag and the less of a problem.  But even in relatively flexible markets, there is likely to be some lag.  Even if there's no state welfare, people might be able to draw down savings or rely on family - all things which could delay their return to employment.

The point is that people value things today based on their expectation of their value in future.  If information emerges which influences something's expected value in the future, this will be reflected in people's valuations today, and in the price today - even though the information may relate to something entirely in the future.
BUT, all that depends on deep and liquid markets - i.e. that everyone fully appreciates the significance of the new information, and reflects it in their valuations.  I think that, although to bitcoiners it is obvious that the microsoft announcement means higher future value of bitcoin (because of more rapid adoption), it is not appreciated widely.  The bitcoin market is still shallow and weird.

This seems pretty obvious to me - and I've read it in a few places so no big mystery.

Only if everyone thinks 1 bitUSD really is worth 1 USD!  They seem to be magicking their way around this, but you can't.
For that to work, everyone has to really believe that whenever they go to the mkt with their n bitUSD, there will always be someone on hand willing to give them n USD.  Who is that going to be?  
Even Govts with huge forex reserves often fail to do this when they try (see Black Wednesday).

The most obvious example is collective bargaining - unions.  How it prevents other people getting hired is that (crudely) it raises real wages, but there is a fixed amount of real income to share around.  So that income  is divided among fewer employees than it otherwise would be.  If each employee costs more, then fewer can have jobs.
In the end this does all work itself out - I agree with your second para.  Someone somewhere in the economy takes enough pay cuts so everyone can work and the price fall is absorbed.  But if there is a lag whenever there is a price fall, *and prices are continually falling*, as in deflation, you get a permanent level of unemployment - as the economy is constantly in the lag phase, in effect.
I'm talking like this is all for sure - and it's not.  Maybe people would make the kind of dynamic adjustment required, accepting that their wages would constantly fall.  But it seems to me a definite possibility and, fwiw, one that most people who study this believe does happen.  I really can't stand it when it gets dismissed out of hand on r/bitcoin (not saying that's what you're doing, but many do).

Guys, this is fucking genius!!
If you are going to heat your house with electricity, you might as well do it thru a mining rig.  Heat generation is 100% efficient anyway (2nd law of thermodynamics - its heat that is the waste).  This way you get mining - and society gets validation of bitcoin transactions - for free! (except the capital costs of the rig).

If buying for the long term (the only sensible approach IMO, as the price right now means v little, and is probably rigged), then I would keep charges in perspective:  either bitcoin will be worth v little in the long run, or it will be worth a helluva lot.  Either way, the charges you pay now will probably not seem that important.  
Obviously you want to get coin as cheap as poss, but IF you believe it is a good long term investment, charges like circle's probably shouldn't stop you.  Others can hopefully give other suggestions for how to buy.  I used various P2P's with no significant problems, tho bear in mind if there are risks your bank won't like it (depends on your jurisdiction).
Far more important is securing your bitcoins.  If you fuck that up you can lose them all.  Do research on setting up an offline wallet.
Overall, I'd regard the process of getting the coins gradually, working out the security and understanding the system as part of the whole thing.  You will feel much better about your investment (esp if price goes up) if you understand this stuff.  Personally I also found it a lot of fun, and helped me realise what a potentially amazing concept bitcoin is.
Welcome to bitcoin!

I agree in general with the "efficient markets" hypothesis you are referring to, and think it certainly applies in respect of stocks, currencies, all the major traded assets. They are all correctly priced unless you know something the rest of the mkt doesn't know.  And if you don't know who's the sucker, it's you.  The entire financial advice industry is based imho on conning ppl into believing they can do better than the mkt.  But if there were any $100 dollar bills lying on the floor, someone wd have picked them up already.
But with bitcoin, I genuinely believe I know something the rest of the mkt doesn't know.  The concept is totally outwith most investors' understanding of the world - as they are so used to accepting as self-evident many of the fundamental concepts which bitcoin actually overturns.
I have a bit of money to invest.  My approach is just to get the cheapest possible investment vehicles, ETFs, index trackers etc - as I think any fund management is basically throwing darts blindfold at a copy of the WSJ, which I can do myself without giving away 2% pa.  The only thing I buy where I'm doing it because I think the mkt is (or could be) genuinely wrong is bitcoin. Lots of ppl in this sub understand it's potential - but the fraction of the real decision makers in global capital markets who do is still so tiny that I do not think it is right to say "bitoin is relatively liquid".
That said, the OP needs to stop!

Great - a real contribution.  
My view has always been that miners' incentives are to trade off the cost-savings of centralisation against the risk that it will affect confidence, and depress the bitcoin price which entirely determines their revenues.  This theory would predict that mining would naturally organise at some optimal balance between those two.  It looks to me like your work provides empirical confirmation of this.
There is still a risk that mining pools could be subverted by their operators (acting against the interests of their constituents).  But I think this is a risk that is naturally mitigated by bitcoin's transparency.  My [previous post]( on this FYI.

I was in a similar situation when starting with bitcoin. Couldn't stop worrying about possibility of being hacked etc, made worse because I didn't really understand the system.  In the end I took the time to work it out and do it "properly" - with an offline armory wallet on an old laptop I wiped and installed Ubuntu, and a paper backup - which I split into 3 overlapping sections, so any 2 were sufficient to recover it ("m of n" - of a kind, I think), that I stored separately. All the info is out there, how to videos on YouTube were particularly helpful.
I'm really glad I did this, not just because I think it is pretty secure, but in the process I inevitably ended up understanding bitcoin, and what it was I was actually trying to achieve (ie not just following a recipe blindly). That has itself given me much more confidence (justified or not!) that I can hodl bitcoin safely. 
And I gotta say, it really was fun in the end! The whole thing seemed like a really knotty problem in some game - and when my first bitcoin came through to my cold wallet it felt like.. ..victory

I'm not that familiar with the evidence.  Not my area.  But I have given one observation, above - and also see supermari0's reply, further above, which seems to me like direct evidence of the behavioural phenomenon underlying sticky wages.
FWIW, I do consider economics a science (or at least it should be), but it is far harder to test hypotheses empirically than in other sciences - and I have a default position of not really believing any such studies unless I have a special reason.  You can make data say almost whatever you want, there is massive selection bias possible, and this is abused flagrantly by many career economists - who are no better than charlatans imo.  I bet you can find studies for and against sticky wages.  
So when trying to make my mind up about questions in economics I put a lot more weight on theory, or simple and direct tests, like asking yourself if you really are insensitive to nominal price changes (that is, if you really feel exactly the same about a 2% wage rise with inflation of 2%, and a 2% wage cut with deflation of 2%).
@_date: 2014-10-22 16:51:13
Not a simple question I think.  Demand for bitcoin depends on value of transactions made with bitcoin.  To this extent its price will (in the long term) depend on the size of the economy - as do stocks.  I'm not saying there isn't a safe haven element to value as well, but it's not as pure as gold for this.
Also just now I reckon general volatility will overwhelm most of these long term trends.

I work in Govt and in my opinion you understate the case.  Every day I see global capital using Govt as an instrument to extract profit at the expense of the suffering and death of their subjects, on a huge scale (I mean this literally and would substantiate it if knew how with anonymity - tho it is a matter of public record essentially).  Final tragedy is competition for these profits drives them to zero so they don't even get anything out of it.

Maybe network effect - need a recognisable brand with nodes everywhere, that you know can interact?  Maybe I'm just blinkered to see everything as a question that bitcoin answers.. ..but this is it,  isn't it?  You can't look for $ signs in different countries, as by definition you are looking for different currencies, so you look for WU signs..  ..(and WU have to have "agents everywhere").  So an actually global currency solves that problem - you just look for bitcoin signs and know you are on the network.  ?

This (banning currencies) has been done throughout history - to little effect.  If people want to use currencies, they do.  Usually the circumstances in which Govts ban currencies are such that it is very desirable for people to use them - eg in a currency crisis - and they are willing to take the risks.  Also countries which ban currencies are, I imagine, more likely to be corrupt - with officials using the banned currency, but also being open to bribery, which makes it just a cost of transaction.  
Fwiw I think this is an inevitable step in the process from here to bitcoin becoming the global currency (if that happens).

I like the idea that the work done to secure the global financial system (bitcoin mining) can be used in home heating (as the work is distributed, and it's byproduct is heat).
So you can expect domestic heating appliances to start shipping with built in mining rigs - and generate a flow of income that offsets the electricity bills you would have had to pay anyway.

@_date: 2014-09-08 16:09:38
Why it's revolutionary as a store of value (rather than a medium of exchange) is that it has explicitly restricted supply, coupled with very cheap transaction/acquisition costs for even small amounts.  There are assets out there you can buy that have similar levels of restriction (eg Monet paintings), but it's a lot harder (and costlier) to get them, or hold a share in them.
The main reason gold has such value ($4tn?) and is used globally as a defensive investment is that new supply is fairly restricted, and it is divisible enough that many people can get it with fairly low transaction costs (and that it has a convention of being valuable).  Bitcoin is much better in terms of restriction of supply, and transaction costs.  If it doesn't all fall down, of course.
Restriction of currency supply is incredibly important.  For example, it explains mostly countries want to be in the eurozone (as their currency will be linked to Germany, who are widely believed to be extremely averse to inflation / increased supply).

He seems to have it in for the coin, and I don't like the guy, but he touches on an interesting issue.  He's right that coin must have value to be useful for exchange (eg if all mkt cap is $1m wd be hard to use it to buy something for $2m).  But what gives it value?  Fundamentally, it's use for exchange!! 
Obviously the process will (must) iterate.  Gets some value (eg thru speculators who think it WILL be used for exchange in future), and then it can be used for exchange. Which means it IS used for exchange, which means it has value, which...  You'd probably expect quite big lurches up and down, with a general trajectory towards its final stable value.
Cd all go in reverse of course, if ppl start using it less than speculators think they will.  But its the use by the unbanked, which hasn't even begun to play through properly, makes me really really believe.

I completely agree.  If anything you say is not consistent with the particular dogma that eg Govt is bad in principle, then you get downvoted and often borderline abused.  I welcome reasoned debate and criticism, but too often I see reflex condemnation by slogan, usually angry.  
It's very frustrating because those of us who think, eg, bad things happen in Govt but we actually need some aspects of what Govt does - and that bitcoin can and will make things better - just don't get a look in.  
Bitcoin can't just be for one particular, quite narrow strand of political opinion.  But I sometimes think r/bitcoin is.

Re: Pollution of the blockchain with non-transaction stuff.
Very interested that the blockchain can be used as a permanent and secure record for basically anything - examples: 
But is there anything to stop people using it frivolously (as they obviously have already) - beyond the initial transaction fee?  There is obviously something wrong here if society will have to bear the costs of storing stuff which may have no value in millions of places, forever.  I read Gavin's scalability proposal, and that seemed to make sense for projections of bitcoin transactions - but what if the blockchain gets swamped with everyone's junk and graffiti?
@_date: 2014-12-15 22:19:11
This is an issue - fees would naturally equilibrate at the cost of transaction.  This may not provide enough mining incentive to secure the network.  But it's a *very* long way off, and plenty of ways it might be solved.  So not a meaningful problem IMO.

It is the network that does the mining.  Keep it private from the network (if that's what you mean), you get no mining.

@_date: 2014-10-27 12:45:08
Spend on mining must equal income from mining in the end.  Any more, and miners will go out of business / do other things.  Any less and people will mine more.
So spend will change with the price of bitcoin.  Or, denominated in bitcoin, spend per block will be the coinbase plus the average fee per block.

Competition means spending by miners on mining will always converge to 1 btc / btc mined.  It doesn't matter what the unit cost of electricity is.
But, rather tragically, wind power is not actually cheap.  It just looks that way (and would be to wind power miners) because of taxpayer subsidies.  So this means bitcoins will be mined with true costs (to society) of &gt; 1 btc / btc mined.

This is worth reading.  It won't tell bitcoiners anything they didn't know (and many will disagree with its speculation about the future use of bitcoin), but it gives the kind of overview that will demonstrate convincingly to non bitcoiners that this has, in fact, already happened.  In particular it shows that bitcoin has been tested over the years by scams and hacks and crackdowns, and it's still there - it is resilient and useful and it is going to stick around.

No, "economics dictates" miners maximise their profits, which is revenue minus costs.  That means not centralising, which would undermine the price, which determines their revenues.
@_date: 2014-11-12 15:39:30
The problem is not people quitting their jobs when asked to accept a pay cut.  The problem arises when people successfully resist wage cuts.  They may keep their jobs, but others are not hired who otherwise would have been if wages had fallen - ultimately creating unemployment somewhere in the economy.
Most of the price cuts you're talking about are through improvements in technological efficiency (each unit of labour generates more units of output) rather than reductions in wages (except, for instance, when China's workforce entered the global labour market, but that's a little different I think).  But it's important to note that these kinds of price cuts are not deflation.  They are, in effect, changes in the relative prices of goods (tech goods vs others).  Deflation means average price levels across the board falling.  Average price levels have risen although tech goods prices have fallen.
@_date: 2014-12-04 00:11:22
Just to take issue with one point here.  The profits to mining will be capped at the marginal rate of return to capital in the economy as a whole.  That is, using the most meaningful definition of profit, zero (after adjustment for risk).  
Consider the decision of a potential miner, who has the  opportunity of investing in a rig and mining a bitcoin.  They assess the competitive situation in mining and judge their costs in generating that bitcoin.  If the costs are less than one bitcoin, they will do it.  In doing so they increase competition, and increase the costs of mining per bitcoin.  If capital is free to enter mining (be invested in mining rigs, rather than some other use), then the expected cost of mining a bitcoin will converge to 1 bitcoin, and profits (after including the costs of capital) to zero.
@_date: 2014-12-12 17:07:02

@_date: 2014-11-20 16:54:47
Maybe.  But arguably one reason WU has a near monopoly is because sheer size is required to make those transfers so cheap (?).  Maybe bitcoin means you don't have to be huge to do fiat-to-fiat cheaply.  So WU will get competition from bitcoin based alternatives (which, I agree, are doing exactly the same thing).  Either way you get cheaper remittance, because bitcoin.

Just a way of showing that at some (finite) point, the market selling to you will run out.  That may be above $1tn, in which case it would be possible to transfer $1tn, but it also may be below, in which case it won't.
Eg imagine it was signed copies of Michael Jackson's "Thriller".  Say there are 100 in existence.  There's a market for them, and a price.  At some point you will be unable to buy more, no matter how rich you are - because either you will own all 100, or the  owners of the remaining copies won't sell at any price.  How ever much money you have left, you can't convert it into signed copies of Thriller.  As it is with Thriller, so it is with bitcoin.

Thanks, molecc, for your thoughts and your tip.  
To answer your point about "just gotta wait".. ..the reason I believe in bitcoin is that I think it is, essentially, the manifestation of fundamental forces of nature, which are beyond our control.  
People want an efficient means of exchange, because [tl;dr, imo:] it allows them to have more of the things they want (by enabling economic specialisation).  They will use what does it best.  Right now it seems to me bitcoin fundamentally does it best (or can do). If this is true it will work - if not, it won't.  Watching what's unfolding, I think it is working.  
This whole thing: I believe  *it is something that is happening to us*.  We are the instruments of external forces.
Once the internet arose, if it hadn't been satoshi who invented bitcoin, it would have been someone else.  (And once computers arose, if it hadn't been whoever "invented" the internet, it would have been someone else (and once x technology arose, if it hadn't been y who invented computers it would have been someone else(and once...))).
If technology is possible, and people want what it can do, it will come into existence and adoption naturally.  That's why I reckon we should sit back and enjoy the ride.  Because I don't think we have any choice!

Your answer implies that, *even though you are not actually having a wage cut, you are thinking about taking action as if you did*.  This is exactly the point.  This is sticky wages.

@_date: 2014-11-12 17:59:13
I got to thinking this is OK.  Pools can't win that much by a 51% attack, or whatever, and they have much more to lose by damaging bitcoin - which is their revenue.  They don't even want to look like they could damage it, as that might be enough to reduce the price and their revenue.  
So you'd expect, particularly as the participants are free moving (fundamentally decentralised), they would naturally settle at some level of organisation that trades off the efficiency of large pool size with the risks of being too big.  I gather that is pretty much what we observe?
It is still possible, it seems to me, that pool operators could short bitcoin and then subvert their pool to deliberately damage bitcoin and drive down the price.  But as long as the damage was only superficial, any price fall would quickly be cancelled out.  Once the market realised this, it would take away the incentive for doing it again.
That would leave the possibility of shorting and then seriously damaging bitcoin, so it's future utility was threatened.  Appreciate any views of if that's possible.
And I agree, it would be good if this stuff was more prominent.  Perhaps @_date: 2014-12-20 14:05:29

All debts are two sided.  A debt for one party is a credit for another, of exactly equal amount.  You can't owe anything without owing it to someone - for whom it will be a credit, or a negative debt if you like.  So the net debt for the world (debt minus credit) must always be zero.

Another reason is that if you are going to go through the trouble of a HF, there is a bunch of stuff that it would be really good to get done at the same time.  The 2x fork did none of that.
But far more important than any of this, the 2x HF was an attempt by a group of company CEOs to take control of the protocol.  No different to telecoms trying to control the internet, citigroup controlling banking regulations etc.  It would really have been the end of bitcoin if they had succeeded.
On the block size, I am far from expert to tell if 2Mb would cause problems or not.  But it is important to recognize that at some point bigger blocks would make the network fail.  And the bigger blocks are, the higher the costs of running a node, the fewer people will run nodes, and the more vulnerable bitcoin will be.  Obviously there's a tradeoff, because tiny blocks are no use to anyone.  But security and decentralization must come first, because without that there is really nothing.

Imagine you had infinite resources to purchase bitcoins (of which there is a finite amount).  You begin purchasing at the market price.  The price rises.  You keep purchasing.  
At some point, you *must* either
* purchase the last bitcoin, which means you cannot purchase any more
* reach the price at which no holder of the remaining bitcoins is willing to sell at any price
There are no other conceivable outcomes.  After either of these two outcomes is reached, you will not be able to buy any more bitcoins.
If this point is reached before you have spent $1tn, it will have been impossible to buy $1tn of bitcoins.

Hey come on, causality anyone?  I mean, any other possible explanation for this??
@_date: 2014-12-04 08:57:44
Hi.  There are all sorts of things which affect the unit cost of *hashing* - including the unit cost of electricity (net of any offsetting gains from use of heat etc, as you say - eg see 
In the end, none of this affects the profits to miners - which will always converge to zero.  If expected profits were &gt;0, more mining resource would enter, and profits would reduce.  If expected profits were &lt;0, mining resource would leave, increasing profits.
What it does affect is the amount of hashing and network security you get.  Eg if electricity costs fall (or heating appliances start running mining rigs which offset those costs), then profits rise and more mining happens - which reduces profits back to zero, but increases the amount of mining, obviously, and therefore the degree of network security.
Edit:  none of this really addresses the (separate) issue of centralisation - which you mention at the start of the post.  My thoughts on this [here]( fwiw.

@_date: 2014-10-22 10:14:51
Thanks, Ilogy, for your considered reply.
If I understand this right, bitshares are essentially credit notes - albeit that they can be traded as crypto can be traded.  But presumably that means their value is essentially the risk-adjusted value of the debt they represent.  So in your example if I am not good for the $1 loan you gave me, the bitUSD you have will be worth zero.  I guess that as others will be making these loans, the risk is spread across the whole market and the value of a bitUSD will reflect how good borrowers as a whole are.  And I guess the further complication is that it's not just USD, bitshares will be backed by loans of all sorts of other assets.  Is that right?
If so, then presumably the notion of bitUSD being "pegged" only holds good if all the borrowers are 100% good for their loans?  Unless some central authority is going to step in to buy bitUSD at exactly $1 if the market won't.
Have I got this wrong, or isn't this just classic naughty investment banking - packaging up debt so you can't see for sure how risky it is, then selling it to people who don't know what they're buying?

I think "rationality" in respect of bitcoin is quite hard to deal with emotionally.  
Rationally I think that, based on the evidence I'm aware of, there is a reasonable probability that the global economy will move to bitcoin over the next few decades - and will change it (and society) in ways we can't even conceive of.  If forced to choose with a gun to my head I would say, yes I believe widespread uptake will happen in, say, 10 years.
The only "rational" arguments against this that I find convincing are: that Govt and vested may be able to delay it; that there is something I don't know about and haven't thought of (and nor has anyone else) which will stop it.  I'm not really worried anymore about fundamental security, scalability or adoption of alternative to bitcoin.
So given that, what do I "rationally" do, in terms of my narrow self interest?  It is very difficult as the rational calculation is giving such crazy answers.  It says if I put a reasonable amount into bitcoin now, I will be extremely wealthy before very long.  It feels like nonsense when you step back from it.. ..but these things do happen.. ..and when I do my best to look objectively at it I just get more and more excited!
I figure I've just gotta wait, not risk anything I can't afford to lose, or get too greedy, and try to enjoy the ride! :)

I broadly agree, but have to ask then:  where is the evidence supporting your view?

I strongly recommend doing research on this, and deciding for yourself the best way to secure your coins.  All the info on the various options is out there.  It will take time but if you sort it for yourself, and understand what you have done fully, you will feel a lot more relaxed while you wait (and watch the price go to the moon).  What you've got to lose, it seems worth the effort.
Fwiw as a noob I wiped an old laptop, turned off wifi, installed ubuntu from a usb iso, (manually updated with apt-get), installed armory, made an offline wallet, backed it up with an unencrypted paper key which I split into 3 overlapping sections so any 2 are enough to restore the wallet, and distributed them appropriately. There are other ways, and variants, but this is the one I thought would work best for me - you should find out what is best for you, rather than following someone's recipe you don't understand.
@_date: 2014-12-11 14:41:36
I believe mining will always be "pooled" in the sense that it will be funded by investment from global capital, one way or another.  Global capital is a pool itself - everyone who owns any investments is part of the pool, and owns part of the capital that is used in industries across the world.  
I have investments in a pension fund, which means I own part of this pool.  When mining is funded by global capital, I will be a miner.  The key thing is that mechanisms exist to ensure the agencies who manage my investment (eg the pension fund managers, but also the boards of all the companies in which the fund holds shares) effectively represent my interests.  In particular, I don't want mining companies in which I invest to over-centralise, as this would reduce my revenue.  As I said in the post, these  mechanisms fail a lot, and shareholders get ripped off when their agents subvert their wishes.  But in mining this is all much more transparent, so I think it is unlikely to be a major problem.

I just think this will be like all attempts bad Govts have made to control the currency their citizens use.  If the currency is useful there will be a thriving black market, with officials turning a blind eye for kickbacks - while probably using it themselves.
The worse a Govt is, the more likely it is to try to ban bitcoin - and the more likely it is to fail.
@_date: 2014-11-04 15:33:25
I'm no expert, but I got around to thinking that, even if the crypto etc is broken, nobody could "steal" large amounts of coins by hacking bitcoin itself.  If something that catastrophic happens, coins would be basically instantly worthless.  Obviously this still means you lose your coins, but the incentive for the attacker is not to get their value, as they can't.
Also I agree with lunarstasis.  Ultimately you are trusting the open source community.  Eg my cold wallet runs in ubuntu - so I'm trusting everything to the open source scrutiny of the package I downloaded.  The deeper point is that, unless you can do everything yourself, nothing is possible without trust.  Either you trust the bank, the Govt, the opensource community.  The latter seems attractive because it is transparent, and I believe it would be hard to organise a sufficiently large conspiracy to subvert it.  Part of what I find interesting about bitcoin is that it lays bare all the trust networks we already have, but often don't really think about.  
Practically, maybe the only way to get the level of assurance your cofounder is (rightly) after is to get involved a bit, play around, make his/her own mind up about who they trust.  In the meantime they might find eg the insurance offered by circle helps, if they're used to trusting such institutions.

Yes, this is a source of regular fun.  You need a token, and it needs to be widely accepted and heavily mined (for security).  So you could invent a new one and start from scratch.  But bitcoin already has the network, everything that follows is a scam that will disappear (unless it turns out there's something really important you can't do on the bitcoin blockchain).
So this is great, let them see how they get on with their non-bitcoin blockchains.  They will work this out in the end!
@_date: 2014-10-10 15:09:49
I seldom see it pointed out here that there is an extremely important function of inflation, without which economies would be much, much worse off, and I think ppl's comments would make a lot more sense and be taken more seriously - esp by  those outside bitcoin who understand this benefit of inflation - if this were recognised.
People selling stuff (including, especially, labour) are reluctant in the short term to reduce their nominal prices (i.e. the face value in $, XBT or whatever, for what they're selling) even if the real value of $ or XBT has increased (and the value of what they're selling, expressed in $ or XBT, has decreased).  This is the phenomenon of "sticky prices" (to be  more specific, prices are "sticky downwards").
Here's why it is a problem.  Suppose you have a fixed supply of money (a certain number of $ or coins).  But then the economy grows.  More transactions, and the economy needs more currency units to cover them.  People literally will not have enough units to buy the goods and services they want at their current prices.  The solution to this is that the exchange rate between the currency unit and the good must reduce, so now there are enough units to cover all the transactions.  Deflation.  This is fine, as long as everyone goes along with it.  It should make no difference at all - everyone still pays and gets the same in real terms.  The nominal price of something doesn't matter, its what you can get with it that counts.    
Problem is, ppl don't see it that way.  Human nature.  And they may be bound into contracts that specified a nominal price.  In particular, labour / unions would resist any fall in nominal wages - even though it may mean no change in real wages.  If people resist a fall in nominal prices, there are not enough currency units to cover all the purchases people want to make - so they don't get made.  All the stuff people were selling cannot be bought, just because there aren't enough currency units (whose number is set by us, society). You get unemployment, recession, depression.  The full resources of the economy are not  being used - just because of the price level, which is in fact wholly arbitrary.  This can be massively costly and cause misery -  entirely unnecessarily.
This is one reason genuinely well-intentioned Govts always aim for a bit of inflation - to accommodate growth in the economy without causing recession.
So when mainstream economists look at bitcoin this is what they see.  They think this is ridiculous, a fixed money supply is a recipe for disaster, it will lock the economy into depression - these people can have no idea what they are talking about.
For me - a paid up believer in bitcoin, and an economist - this is the biggest question  whose answer is not widely discussed.  I've been thru all the rest - security, energy of mining,  altcoins - and come to understand all that is OK.  There is an answer to this question - though one which many might not like.  To be the currency of the global economy (which I believe it can), bitcoin will have to programme some sort of permanent monetary expansion  (unless human nature - the basis of stick prices - changes).  If it doesn't, its use will fix the world into a permanent depression.  Which means the world will choose to use something else, which has the correct monetary formula (or whatever Andreas said).

The point would be that it isn't just left to miners to determine fees.  We see how that plays out and arguably it does not align with the incentives we want.  They still end up including txs which optimally shouldn't be included (i.e. the costs of putting them in the blockchain are excessive, compared to the value of doing so to whoever is putting them in).  If difficulty could be set in the system, to give the optimal balance of incentives for volume of txs, this could be better, no?
Not sure how use experience would change fundamentally.  They already have to choose a fee.  Doing this would make their choice of fee more aligned with the actual costs of their tx.

I think the real "breakthrough(s)" will (may) come when (if) big institutions and then Govts decide bitcoin is not going to fall over, and will be a permanent store of value with explicitly restricted supply - like gold, only better.  
All of that probably won't happen, ever, but if over the next decade or so institutional investors take hedge positions in bitcoin, or Govts back their currencies with it, or it becomes the de facto global reserve currency, you can multiply the current values by 1000s or more.
@_date: 2014-11-19 22:10:46
To my mind the killer rebuttal to this - which I have attempted to post, but not yet accepted - is that miners' revenues depend entirely on the value of bitcoin.  Profit maximising miners will trade off any economies of scale against the imperative of maintaining the integrity of bitcoin, and the value of their revenues.  That means avoiding even looking like they might dominate mining.  Which is what they do.
This is the kind of perspective and language hopefully such "economists" can understand, and will get them to think properly.

But they are dependent on having bitcoin..  So if you want to sell someone an IoT washing machine or whatever, you don't need to get them to ~~buy~~ get a wallet at the same time.
Good point that users won't cover cost of electricity.  BUT you could regard this as users paying for stuff through their electricity bill, rather than with a bitcoin wallet.  Might pay a bit of a premium (as their mining is not as efficient).  Will be completely new services so I doubt people will be that conscious of paying too much - and if they are they get a bitcoin wallet.
The future difficulty.. ..does sound problematic.  Partly mitigated to the extent that difficulty is determined by long run price - which wouldnt matter for 21, as embedded chips make less btc, but it's worth more.  The bigger problem is technology obsolescence.  I have no idea how that goes - are ASICs getting better much quicker?

Obviously the person with a million dollars.  But this is really just because they are both getting a 2% real interest rate (the savings rate minus inflation - in this case, zero minus -2%, =+2%).  This is obviously better for the person with more capital.
But real interest rates are (by definition) independent of inflation or deflation.  If there was inflation of 5%, the interest rate both people would get on their savings accounts would be 3% (for the same real interest rate of 2%).  
Inflation or deflation doesn't actually have anything to do with this.
@_date: 2014-09-27 10:01:09
Also note there is a good reason we *want* some inflation - sticky prices, esp wages. TL;DR is that ppl will resist falling nominal prices, even tho real prices constant, and this causes unemployment and recession (as the price they are holding on to means society can't afford what their offering).
This will have to be addressed if/when btc is standard currency in global economy.

Thankyou - this is exactly the problem, what makes half-informed economists oppose bitcoin.  Dismissing reasonable and sincere views, held by most people who've thought hard about this stuff (not bitcoin, macroeconomics) by calling them silly.  Ironically this is exactly what Krugman does, dismissing bitcoin and those who have thought about it.  He is wrong, imho, but just calling sticky prices silly is no different than him calling bitcoin evil.  
You are right about this: people will reduce wages eventually.  But  delay is enough for permanent unemployment.  And wages are where stickiness is a problem - not mkt prices for finished goods like computers which, as you say, can adjust quickly.  
As for Austrian economics.  I'll look at the links at some point.  But in the end, economics is just arithmetic - which is the same in any country / ideological school.  IF people delay reducing wages THEN there will be recession / depression etc (the arithmetic will show, I believe).

I'm a fully paid up bitcoin dreamer, I buy the whole thing, but I'm sorry this business about deflation not being a problem, and it's all just a scare tactic by Govt, is just plain wrong.  
He says falling prices are good for private citizens because (by implication) they get things cheaper, and bad for Govt because they get less tax.  Both of these assertions are *entirely incorrect*.  If prices fall because of deflation of the currency the real value of things (and of taxes) is unchanged.  People and Govts can buy the exactly the same amount of stuff, and it is the amount of stuff that matters.  This part of his argument is a simple fallacy.  
The problem with deflation is that people do not readily accept apparently falling wages, even though their real wages (and the amount of stuff they can buy) may be constant because the prices of stuff is also falling.  So they resist (apparently) falling wages.  Sticky prices.  This causes (by simple logic) unemployment and recession.  If it persists, and people don't change the way they approach these things, it can cause permanent depression.  Very very bad, for *people*.
I don't think this is really a problem with bitcoin for now - as it will only be relevant when we are on the moon and bitcoin is poised to be the single global currency.  But it will be a problem we have to find a way of dealing with when we get there.  Hearing this kind of (imo) poorly considered, slanted and evidently flawed argument pisses me off - and makes bitcoin look less credible in the eyes of people who think (as virtually all economists do) that deflation is genuinely a very bad thing for society.

1.  Yes, but this could be good if it allowed people to trade off security and cost.  Eg a very secure very expensive blockchain for long term savings etc, and less secure / cheaper for coffees and whatnot.

@_date: 2015-05-09 15:39:30
I think your right.  A major part of true cost of using bitcoin is the maintenance of utxo's.  This is a function of the time they have to be maintained. So the current solution of inflation tax works the right way in the sense that holders of bitcoin pay.  But its not quite right because the true costs depend on the number of utxos, not the value of bitcoin in them - which is the current basis for the charging.
So in the end we (or ppl of the future) will need a way of making users pay per utxo per day it is maintained.
Maybe this is exactly your line of thought.

@_date: 2014-12-08 10:53:11
Hi, good question with good answers IMO.  Here's a few.
The current system may work for you, but most people in the world don't have bank accounts, and can't participate in the internet economy - largely because of deficiencies with existing financial mechanisms, including high costs (often hidden).  Anyone with a phone and a bitcoin wallet can have a bank account, and trade with anyone else, anywhere in the world, with negligible transaction costs.
Abuse of the current system - which enables vested interests to capture financial mechanisms - recently almost led to a total global economic shutdown.  Bitcoin is immune to these interests and cannot be captured.  Nobody owns or controls it.
As more commerce relies on computer systems, approaches which centralise financial information are increasingly vulnerable to exploitation, theft and fraud.  Eg the hundreds of millions of credit cards stolen by hacking Target, Home Depot etc.  Bitcoin can eliminate these risks, if used properly, as it relies on mathematics for security (rather than eg firewalls), and users control their own financial information rather than provide it to merchants and hope it is not misused.
Most people live in countries where corrupt Govts manipulate and abuse currencies for their own purposes, and at the expense of their citizens.  Bitcoin is immune to subversion by Government.
TL;DR - bitcoin is much better as a medium of exchange than current systems.  The current systems work to an extent but bitcoin does it all far better.  It can also do things current systems can't do, like smart contracts etc, and is perfectly suited to provide a financial infrastructure for a global internet-based economy.
@_date: 2015-05-19 18:10:10
But why mining?  It is unnecessary for all that.  Which is good because someone else will realise and do a no mining version which should be more competitive.
@_date: 2014-11-06 08:49:39
I think he's right, it is a natural monopoly.  There will always be some tiny saving you can make by joining two pools together.  But miners know that if they do that they will fuck with bitcoin (though only a bit, as you can't rewrite much of the blockchain) and that will reduce their revenues.  The tiny efficiency gains from pooling above eg 51% are outweighed by the expected losses.
So you'd expect mining pools to naturally organise themselves at a level which maximises efficiency, while preserving the integrity of the system they rely on.  Which, as kwanijml says, is what we observe empirically.
A shame this guy - an academic economist - didn't ask on here first.  There is a lot of interesting economics in here, but I guess he won't be the one publishing the papers on it.

Seems to me it is substantially an all-or-(not much) situation we are in here.  Bitcoin is inherently global, trade is largely global, currencies  have extremely powerful network effects which mean the bigger they are the more useful they are.  Those effects usually butt up against the limitations of national policy.. ..but for the first time there's one that knows no more borders than the internet.  Ultimately it is hard to see how Govts could successfully restrict it for long, any more than they can restrict the internet.

Yes, individual chips will essentially never mine a block, so even with their current plan they'll have to push satoshis back to it.  If they're going to do that, it has to be more efficient to mine (or buy) the satoshis elsewhere and push them to the device's software wallet.  The embedded asic is an inefficient bolt-on as far as I can see.  You'd likely not mine enough satoshis in a chip's lifetime to cover it's hardware cost.
I think this will all happen, but with software/firmware wallets.  And if the device is going to earn, it has to be more efficient to do so using its idle processing/storage/bandwidth - resources it needs to do its primary job.

It's important to note that supporters of BU (of which I am definitely not one) would regard this in exactly the opposite way - that "core", for want of a better word, is taking over bitcoin.
Neither side is right or wrong, in the sense that there is no particular privelege given to one set of beliefs or objectives.  The core developers don't own bitcoin any more than the BU developers.

2.  Though this sub mostly can't entertain the thought, there is a very respectable argument that deflationary currency would be a serious problem.  But one that probably won't be relevant till we're on the moon.

I was just thinking that it means all the security backend etc is taken care of already.  Eg in your example - the issuer needs to set up a secure system that ensures the QR code can't be faked or whatever.  Basically tickets are all a kind of crypto key, aren't they?  So if the blockchain is basically as good a crypto system as you can get, and it is everywhere, and extremely cheap to use, why not use that (if you are setting a system up)?
I imagine (in ignorance) that it would be pretty straightforward to produce a completely generic ticketing application using the blockchain - so it would be trivial for anyone to set up a ticket system.

Well it depends what the question is.  If the question is whether going from $1 to $10 (at a time when it is $1 - i.e. back then) is the same as going from $1000 to $10,000 (at a time when it is $1000 - i.e now), then I think it *really* is the same.  
Put it another way:  is going from $1 to $10 (then) the same as going from $1000 to $1009 (now)?

Electrum is fine.  One reason to use the phone is how easy it is to send payments, eg by scanning a QR code.  But come to think of it, you probably want to see the transactions happening in a bit more detail, so maybe electrum would be the way to go.  
But once you get into large amounts and cold storage is when things get harder, if you are doing it yourself.  Doing cold storage yourself is properly difficult if you're starting from scratch.  So strong advice is either to get comfortable with small amounts first, and understand the system before setting up cold storage, or get a hardware wallet that takes care of everything for you.  
If you have significant amounts and are not (or do not become) expert, then I'd find it hard to see a reason not to use a hardware wallet.

Bitcoin has taken another small step towards financial respectability with the news that three elder statesmen from the financial world are to form an advisory board at Xapo, a Silicon Valley start-up championing the crypto-currency.
They are Larry Summers, former US treasury secretary; John Reed, who was one of the main proponents of the greater use of technology in banking while Citigroup CEO in the 1990s; and Dee Hock, the founder of Visa, reports Richard Waters, the FT's west coast editor.
The announcement is the latest sign of growing recognition from the mainstream financial industry of the potential behind bitcoin and the technology that underpins it, known as the blockchain.
Nasdaq said this month that it planned to start using the blockchain to streamline the settlement process in parts of its market, while the New York Stock Exchange has become an investor in Coinbase, Silicon Valley's best-capitalised bitcoin start-up.
Xapo's move to co-opt three well-known names from the financial world also reflects an effort by bitcoin start-ups to rebrand themselves. Companies backing the crypto-currency have been working hard to shake off memories of the extreme volatility caused by a speculative bubble in 2013 and 2014, as well as scandals like the collapse of the bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox.
Mr Summers himself backed the call for greater regulation of bitcoin earlier this year, arguing that the digital currency would only fulfill its potential in reducing costs and stimulating more innovation in finance if it was properly absorbed into the mainstream.
Mr Summers' support for Xapo comes despite his role as a special adviser to venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, a voluble backer of bitcoin and leading investor behind Coinbase, which has raised $107m.
Xapo, with $40m of venture capital behind it, was founded by Argentinian financial services entrepreneur Wences Casares, whose previous ventures included Banco Lemon, an institution for the unbanked.

Ha! Yes of course. This shd be top comment.  The risk implied by op is a logical impossibility.  (Tho I suppose attackers could gain indirectly from bringing the settlement system down, but that feels a lower order of significance).

Not gonna pitch in but if I were you I'd tell them about Nasdaq, and how the blockchain enables settlement / transfer of assets far easier and quicker and more securely than having lawyers manually maintain spreadsheets or whatever.  It is a short step from that to seeing that transferring value itself is better on a decentralised autonomous ledger / blockchain.  And NASDAQ, pillar of the establishment, is actually doing it (they say), so not just libertarian ranting.

Bitcoins are all associated with addresses.  Each address has a private key that can unlock it and spend the coins.  If you have the private key, you control the coins.  A bitcoin wallet will contain all the addresses you own, plus all the private keys.
If your private keys are on an online computer, there is a risk they can be found by an attacker, and then they steal your coins.  
Paper wallets are a way of keeping private keys offline.  Though ideally you'd like to make sure the keys are  also generated offline, and do all you can to ensure no possibility of leakage of information between your computer and the internet.  Ideally you'd like to use a computer that had never been online before, and would never go online after.    
Physical wallets like trezor are, in effect, computers that can never go on line, and are designed to generate and store private keys in the most secure way possible.

The cost a rational miner will incur in gaining a bitcoin will be less than or equal to the value of the bitcoin they gain.  In a competitive mining market, which we have, the cost will equal the value of the bitcoin. 
So you are right, but the causality is in the other direction - spending on mining is determined by the value of bitcoin.  Which itself is determined by the demand for and supply of bitcoins.  The supply is pre-determined, and essentially fixed. The demand for bitcoins is determined by people's utility for them, as a medium of exchange and a store of value.
@_date: 2015-05-18 19:44:32

@_date: 2015-05-26 20:32:29


Yes.  Problem is, each miner will know that all other miners are doing the same.  For any miner to fork, they would have to be confident that the majority of others *will* also decide to fork.  Same goes for speculators I'd have thought - the same calculation.  If I was a miner I can imagine thinking that inertia alone will mean at least some won't.  And I'd know others would know that.  Absent compulsion it is hard to see how independently acting miners would choose to fork - even though they may all agree a fork is desirable.
I assume compulsion is not possible.  So that leaves co-ordination by communication.  I suppose the 2 or 3 biggest could do it by prior agreement.  Is that possible?  Quite ironic that we might need mining to be fairly centralized!
(Also, if the above is right, it would mean that introducing speculators would make things much worse, as they would not be directly involved in the decision to fork.)
One more question: does moving to 20Mb blocks necessarily require a *hard* fork?
@_date: 2017-02-04 10:28:41
**TL;DR** miners are in brutal competition and are compelled to always and only do whatever increases efficiency - including betraying each other if there are attempts to collude.  Bitcoin users and nodes have many extremely potent threats that would entirely destroy all value owned by miners if they acted against the interests of the network - including by changing PoW algorithm.  Ultimately miners must and shall strictly obey users and nodes.

One question, I vaguely got the idea one reason trezor is good is that it is dedicated hardware, and less able to run bad things (you see I am a noob), whereas there is this known vulnerability of USB firmware (?) which has always made me a bit uneasy.  Any comment on that?

I think you and you dad should probably stop what you're doing and get legal advice.  These are not necessarily your bitcoins to do with as you please - did he leave a will?  Are you sure he meant you to have them?  I gather he will have known he was dying, and it would be surprising if he hadn't thought about arrangements for passing on such a large amount.
As he died a few days ago then I'm sure you have other things to be concerning yourself with too.  If he had 500+ coins they'll be in a hardware wallet and there is not going to be any sort of rush to get them - they won't be going anywhere.

On some routers it refers to this as "game and application sharing" or something.  There may be a bunch of options for things like eMule, xbox, and games.  You need to create a new one (unless you see bitcoin already there) with port 8333 and assign it to your machine on the network.

I think this is brilliant.  I love the aggregation by continent.  Also it's good that the default is USD.  The charts are extremely clear and powerful. Navigation between countries etc is a breeze.
One suggestion:  while the zoom tools are also very powerful, I found myself wishing for the addition of a simple button or menu that would just rescale the x axis, and display over a particular timescale (back from the present).
Thank you for making this for us to use! 
edit: also it would be great to format the y axis numbers so they are easier to read when the numbers are large - it's hard to count the list of zeroes.

Before condemning this, I recommend reading what they are actually saying (linked elsewhere in this thread).
Eg "We are in a debt crisis of historic proportions because for far too long profit-maximising banks have been lending money into existence as debt with too few effective restraints on their conduct and all the risks of doing so forced on the taxpayer by the power of the state."
@_date: 2017-02-26 11:19:56
I see the reset button.  But what I'm really thinking of is a simple way to just choose a different time period for the graph.  When I'm on a laptop, drawing a box to zoom to isn't so easy with the trackpad.  And the wheel zoom, while cool, also re-scales the y axis proportionally.   The panning helps but I can't seem always to get it to work.  
Does that make sense?  Sorry if I'm just missing something.
@_date: 2015-05-26 10:39:16
IMO the community benefits from regular questions like this, and it is part of you working things out, so up voted.  
Just wanna mention armory.  Great for offline storage (can sign transactions from an offline machine), very secure, community and devs seem like the business and as a noob I learned a lot about bitcoin by working out how to install and use it - feels pretty old school and real.  You also run a full node if you use it which I like.
@_date: 2014-10-30 19:00:44
As others have said, there are also tx fees.  But you are fundamentally right there is an issue here.  You'd expect tx fees to stabilise at the cost of processing a tx.  Securing the whole network probably needs more than this, and there is a question of who will pay after the mining reward subsidy is gone.  
This is an example of a "public good" market failure - it's in nobody's interests to pay more than the tx fee individually, unless they're sure everyone else will also pay.. ..which they won't.  Even though everyone loses if the network is not secured.  Ironically this type of market failure is one good reason why we have Govts.
But we've got a few decades at least to sort this out - and see Gavin Andresen's [blocksize economics](  paper, which already discusses some solutions.
@_date: 2016-03-03 15:52:05

If you can't buy bitcoin direct, then right now you are restricted to things like GBTC - which track bitcoin, in effect, in a somewhat indirect way (because the fund can't buy more bitcoin).  That's why there were such huge premiums for GBTC, because more demand doesn't feed through to the bitcoin market itself.
But an ETF would be a far better solution for these people, as they are much better related to the underlying asset, i.e. no premium,  because the fund can buy bitcoin and arbitrage should do the rest.  If the premium disappears on GBTC it's a strong indication people think an ETF is coming, as this would likely  wipe out all premium immediately.
@_date: 2015-05-10 11:08:39
It would definitely disincentivise over-inclusion of transactions.  This *has* to be a good thing in the end.  If the blockchain fills up with things whose costs of inclusion are greater than the value of including them (i.e. bloat, spam, whatever), then the system (possibly?) has to fail in the end -  as someone has to pay.
Would need to tailor the system to give the right balance.  Eg if set v low difficulty for tx PoW, it would have no effect at all.  Raise it a bit, and will start to have some disincentive for low value txs.
@_date: 2015-05-28 15:24:42

Hi again.  I've spent more time browsing your site, and it really is amazing - you get a much better understanding of bitcoin's use around the world.
Anyway, in case you want this feedback, another couple of minor things occurred to me:
* in the data tables, I naturally look for the USD value first, rather than tx number.  I don't know if it's easy to choose what to sort by.  Personally I'd prefer value as default.
* again in the data table, it occurs to me that weekly might be a better figure than daily?  I imagine the daily numbers jump around a bit.  And that table is so useful for telling where the most action is going on, so it would be good to have confidence that what you're seeing isn't just a blip or a day-of-the-week thing.
Thanks again, it's been a long time since I saw something that gave me as much new understanding as this.

Strictly speaking we should be expressing these in real terms - ie adjusting  for the fiat inflation.  Eg I bet it's an ATH everyday in VEF.  If that's 2% pa or so for USD you should add maybe $70 to each of those USD amounts.

Good point on tx number vs value, I hadn't really thought about it - they do tell you different things, both important.  And the average tx value seems to vary a lot - presumably reflecting very different kinds of use across countries - 10x more in China than Russia and Venezuela.

Seems to me you get these results directly from your assumptions. It is possible that total fees would be greater with larger blocks - but as far as I can see, without data, it's just as possible they'd be lower.
Essentially, by applying a block limit you are doing the same as a monopoly producer does in restricting supply of their product. There will be some optimal volume of supply which maximises revenue (actually profit, but sticking with revenue, or assuming zero marginal cost, makes this easier). But without data I see no reason to think that increasing supply in this case (raising the blocksize) would increase rather than decrease total revenue / fees.
But the bigger problem this ignores is that miners will act on their individual interests (of course), and not in the interests of the overall network. For example, imagine the marginal cost of including transactions was zero, and there was no blocksize limit. Individual miners would include every transaction with a non-zero fee, and blocks would be very large. The problem is that the existence of large blocks may impose costs (in the widest sense) on others in the network - eg users may suffer because the network can't propagate, people can't run nodes, all that stuff. The key thing is that these costs are not reflected in the miner's decision, and the risk is that the others who are forced to bear them choose not to - and bitcoin breaks. (These costs are a "negative externality" to the miner's choice of how many transactions to include). That is the main argument for having a block size limit, it seems to me, and I don't think your analysis addresses it.
You might say that miners wouldn't do anything to jeopardise network security, as this would affect the value of bitcoin. This is true collectively, but the miners act individually - and they are caught in a prisoner's dilemma (or similar), where there's no point them acting in the interests of the network if others don't, so they might as well not. Everyone knows this, so it becomes irrational to act in the interests of the network.

What you have said does not support this statement.   It seems to me impossible to support without data. 


Under your assumptions there are more total fees (though whether this is the same as a "stronger fee market" is debatable).  But it is equally possible that there will be less total fees.


Maybe,  maybe not.  Your certainty is entirely unwarranted.

Don't see why moving around would be incentivised, as you would still have utxos. Unless it incentivises consolidation that reduces utxos (can this happen?) In which case this is exactly what the system should incentivise.
No way to avoid fact that maintaining utxos has a cost.  The optimal system will correctly allocate these costs to the owner of the utxo.

No.  Mining is competitive.  If everyone else sets a min fee of 0.1, and your marginal cost is 0.01, you will make pure profit by hoovering up everything in between, if you can.  Of course everyone else will be in the same position, and fees are driven to the marginal cost (unless there is a blocksize limit) of 0.01.
So, on the contrary, "profit-seeking behaviour of miners" will lead to transactions having *the lowest economically viable (per transaction) fees*.  For exactly the same reason that profit seeking manufacturers of any commodity end up driving prices down to the cost of production of the commodity (including cost of capital, i.e. mkt rate of return, i.e "normal" profit).

Spot on, opportunity costs ftw..
And presumably the marginal cost of supplying a unit of botnet activity will equal the market price (per unit) of botnet activity.
So what the world needs to do is raise this marginal cost and thereby reduce supply.  But inclusion in a botnet is an externality to the decisions of people whose computers are enlisted, to the extent it doesn't affect their use of the computer - why should they pay or make effort to stop other people being attacked.
So ultimately there's no solution unless someone can force better malware protection on users who don't want it.  Where's govt when you need it?  :p

I think you correctly identify the key to understanding bitcoin - it is a payment network (better than "system" IMO) which runs autonomously.  To enable this it requires a value incentive for people out there to provide computing resources to secure the network.  That incentive (and also the unit of account) is in the bitcoins that are created.  So the network and the token are both essential.
While I'm on, it occurred to me that ppl on that thread, saying bitcoin doesn't solve any problems, would do well to imagine what their lives would be like without a bank account, and no way to participate in the internet economy (or lots of other parts of the economy, for that matter). If they think this would be a problem - well it IS a problem for most people in the world. Bitcoin solves that problem, giving anyone with a phone a bank account and access to a global transaction network.
You might also try (its hard I know!) to rise above some of the emotive and personal language you are being confronted with!

* Number of possible phrases beginning at word 1 = X.  (i.e 1; 12; 123; etc).
* Number of possible phrases beginning at word 2 = X-1  (2; 23; etc).
* ...
* Number of possible phrases beginning at word X = 1.
So total possible phrases = 1 + 2 + ... + X
Which is a little more than 0.5X^2.  (if it was X + X +.. ...+X you'd have X squared, but this is like a half triangle of that square.  Actually you have a [triangular number]( if you want to calculate more exactly).
I am not a crypto person but feels like this is not a very big number if you have the book.  Eg 100k words gives 0.5*10^10 possibilities or total guesses needed.

You're basically saying that we'll be OK if the 'attacker's' interest are the same as 'ours' (and if they calculate outcomes accurately).  Which is true.  But there are lots of circumstances in which they aren't the same - eg if the attacker can make doublespends that pay off (probably not in this case), or has different time preferences to 'ours'.  Or maybe they don't face the full costs of bitcoin's failure - eg they can cash in now and go bankrupt or something.  Or they just aren't good at calculating future outcomes.  You can be 'rational' and still make mistakes.  Or maybe they have a different risk aversion profile to us (are they a gambler).
Basically it's a choice of whose preferences we're ruled by, who makes the decisions:  in this case it looks like if the 'attack' succeeds we will be, for a while at least, ruled by the preferences and calculations of one person (or whoever controls him, if that's how it works).  However if, for example, a PoW change (or threatened change) can work - i.e. if the attack can be defended - then we're back to a much greater plurality of decision makers.  I think that is enormously preferable.  That's a much bigger deal than "if segwit gets activated" or if we have bigger blocks, neither of which are the main issue here - it's an issue of who controls bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-30 20:03:01
Yes, maybe.  Although there's no guarantee monopoly pricing would give the right costs to users, it's hard to say.  And it does seem like mining may have a tendency to centralisation (cf Bitmain) that makes it risky trusting they will "be rational.  Much better in my view to have nodes in charge.  
But most importantly but I think we absolutely must have layer 2.  It's clearly the optimum and if Bitcoin can't do it, something else will and will overtake.  Miners might come round to that in the end, but I'm not sure.
TLDR I think it will be OK in the end, but it will take longer via BU
@_date: 2017-03-29 23:01:09


Do you have any estimate of what block size this would be?  Because here's my problem.  (As a professional economist, for what that's worth).   It's not obvious that market demand would have any meaningful natural limit.  Just like demand for anything, it is only meaningfully limited by supply, operating through the price mechanism.  What would demand for cars be if supply of cars was not a limit, and car owners faced no costs of ownership?  How many would you stop at?  
And just like cars, there is a cost someone has to pay for blockspace.  Every transaction on the blockchain has to be curated and maintained forever, at a cost to someone.  Markets work when users face the true economic costs of what they are choosing.  When this doesn't happen, they fail.  What you seem to be proposing is that users should face no costs and every whim anyone could think of should have its space in the blockchain, to be maintained there forever.  This seems insane to me, and guaranteed to cause the failure of bitcoin.

People can be rational and make mistakes though.  The problem with the power being centralised in one person's hands, if they succeed, is we are completely dependent on them making good decisions.

I haven't really looked into EC.  Tbh it seems like a red herring.  BU too - it really looks like amateur hour and I don't really understand why anyone takes it seriously.  Seems to me this is really about whether the dominant ASIC maker and miner can do what he likes.  Most importantly, can he kill layer 2.  It might as well be a Govt attack as far as I can see.  It will fail, because layer 2 will happen somewhere - just as no Govt could ever kill all crypto even if they could probably kill bitcoin.

Maybe there's something I'm not understanding about what you said, but I can't see how you've addressed my point.
Regarding your point, this "veto" comes at a cost - and I see no reason miners would choose to bear it individually. Perhaps you are implying there would be some sort of gentlemen's agreement among miners that they will all bear these costs to punish anyone who breaks the informal rules. But this seems implausible to me, to say the least.

The point is that changing PoW would render current miners' capital (their ASICs) almost worthless at a stroke.  This would be so devastating that no major miner would conceivably hold out against a credible threat to change the PoW.
So all we have to do is build a credible threat. 
@_date: 2017-03-31 07:41:15
I'm not saying it is the Govt - of course it's not - and I'm sure EC was conceived with good intentions.  
My point is that EC and BU are only in play because they are a way for the largest miner to get what they want now.  He presumably doesn't care about them and won't feel in the least constrained by them in future.  
From that perspective it is just an attack by a very large miner to get what they want.

@_date: 2017-03-24 14:38:48
I agree.  Another way to say this is that it's rational for self-interested actors to try 51% attacks if they can get away with it.  But it's also rational for the rest of the economic system to attempt to resist such attacks, and that's what OP is doing - and arguably the majority of bitcoin development has done.  
Also consider what happens if this (self-interested, rational) attack succeeds.  We will have a system in which it is clear that all power is concentrated in the hands of a few people, or perhaps one.  They will know exactly what to do to extract what they want from the system.  You might like BU but it's not obvious at all  that the powers behind this attack are interested in BU per se, and they seem fundamentally opposed to scaling (again this is rational, I think).  
If bitcoin can't resist such attacks it fails.  That's what the whitepaper is all about, making something work despite the fact that rational actors will try to subvert it.  This is the 51% attack to end all 51% attacks, and if it succeeds I think it's probably all over.

Ultimately I think it's all about the network effects, which mean we should expect to end up with a winner takes all, or almost.  
The internet is a good example.  It is obviously pointless to have two internets because the internet is all about communication: transaction of information between parties.  Same with currency.
Right now we have a very artificial system in which national governments enforce monopolies over currency.  But it's easy to see that without that enforcement a single currency would win.  Now we have a situation where tech allows those monopolies to be overcome, and we should expect convergence on a single supra-national currency.  
Note we had a single global currency before fiat:  gold.  It took millennia of developmemt to do it, with local civilisations gradually ditching their local currencies (eg shells etc) in favour of the currency that worked best for trade.  The problem with gold is it was so much less useful than fiat currencies, when they came along, that it was overtaken as a medium of exchange.  But bitcoin (with layers) looks likely to be even more useful than fiat.
Also there's the point that if any other coins turn out to do something useful, then it can (probably) be used in bitcoin - once it's tried and tested.
That doesn't mean bitcoin has to win, but it has to fuck up to lose.  And when you get down to it, IMO probably the only thing that could irretrievably fuck it up would be to bloat the blockchain - which cannot be reversed without throwing the whole thing away.

You do nothing at all to receive Bitcoin so that's easy. Unless you count giving your address, which you can do by space phone or morse code, whatever.

Yes I think they'd probably do that.  Monopoly pricing, econ 101.  As long as they could co-ordinate. And that's probably OK as far as it goes, you'd get a price that had some chance of reflecting true cost.  But the problem of course is that the miners would resist things like LN if they thought it reduced their profits, however good it was for users (i.e. however much consumer surplus was available).
But that's not what is proposing.  Also if what we hear attributed to him is to be believed, Jihan Wu wants something very different from BU.  They are being used.

As well as being *incredibly* interesting, IMO, you will get confident with managing and using Bitcoin, and it is kind of part of the point that you take responsibility yourself.  That's why don't leave coins at eg coin base - if you don't have the private keys, you don't really own them, coin base do.
Good luck, and have fun!
edit: I think a trezor is more secure than buying a whole computer.  The *hardware* is designed not to let your keys leave the device.
@_date: 2016-06-04 22:15:21
The crucial thing is, do you hold your keys - on your devices or whatever, even tho this may use a 3rd party wallet - or does someone else eg coinbase or circle. If you don't hold your keys you don't really own the Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-06-04 17:01:33
You never get to choose addresses, they are generated in the creation of the public and private key pair - which is exactly what bitaddress is doing.  The public key becomes your address, after a bit of polishing up I think. Some people have 'vanity addresses' but that's just from creating lots and picking ones they like.
For security and peace of mind - especially if new and your talking a significant amount - personally I prefer a hardware wallet like trezor, tho I hear ledger is good too.  Unlike usb drives or offline laptops, these things are designed with one thing in mind - securing your Bitcoin - and they are classy products, trezor anyway, IMO. Don't lose your seed if that's the way you go.
@_date: 2016-06-21 14:09:45
If you didn't realise this could happen when you bought - given that it has consistently happened through bitcoin's history - and don't like this sort of volatility, then I think you fucked up back then, and you should probably learn from your mistake, sell your bitcoin and avoid cryptocurrency.
And nobody knows what will happen in future so just don't even ask.  You have to take responsibililty for yourself ffs.

If you lose your seed and your device you have definitely lost all your bitcoins.  So make sure to store your seed somewhere very safe, possibly with a few copies.
I don't have a ledger, but there will certainly be some kind of password so that anyone finding the device cannot just use it to make transactions.
@_date: 2017-01-10 13:35:57

@_date: 2018-10-26 07:22:32
I think the idea is you effectively offer a bounty to any watchtower, or a list of watchtowers - which will be commercial entities, competing for your custom.  Presumably any watchtower that started scamming you would go out of business.
@_date: 2017-01-14 01:46:06
BIP38 is a bunch of math which you can use to recover your seed from an encrypted version, plus password.  Unless math changes (i.e. it won't), you can always recover your seed this way.   It's like saying 2 + 2 will always = 4.
You do need to know the math though.  If you're worried, make a copy of [it](  Realistically it is hard to imagine this won't exist somewhere pretty much forever.

Spot on.  You could have a meaning of "backing", where, eg you'd say the value of cars is backed by driving.  But this is *not* the meaning when talking about currencies.  This whole thing is ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-08-07 20:50:35
GDP *per annum* is just a big number of money I guess which other things get compared to - eg national debt.  But  the *per annum* is arbitrary, and there's no particular reason not to choose GDP per second, or per 47 days.
@_date: 2017-01-18 12:27:43
No problem.  Btw, as anyone here will tell you:  you are extremely unlikely to make any money mining, it's a massive industrial process these days.
@_date: 2017-01-09 01:03:56
In the context of currencies, "backed" means a correspondence between one unit of the currency and a fixed amount of some other asset for which it can be redeemed.  Historically gold, obviously.
So unless we are changing this meaning, or introducing two quite different meanings for the same word in the same context, then bitcoin - like all fiat currencies - is not backed by anything. 
@_date: 2016-06-12 16:51:54
Broadly agree, but I do think that, right or wrong, a consistently rising price does give people confidence that bitcoin is alive and thriving, and good to use.

In effect, the recovery seed *is* your full set of keys.  It's not like an account identifier which Keepkey or Trezor use to then look up your details.  The seed is the mathematical root of all keys that will be generated by the wallet.  No other information is required (except the math required to process the seed to generate the keys).
@_date: 2016-06-04 22:21:25
To spend or move Bitcoin you have to compose a valid transaction and transmit it to at least one node of the Bitcoin network.  It's conventional to do this by going online but in principle you could probably read the hexadecimal out over the phone or something :p
Offline or cold storage works by composing (and signing) the transaction offline, so your private keys aren't at risk of exposure, and then worrying about getting the signed transaction (which does not reveal your keys) to the network.

Of course with fiat it's all fake paper!

Make sure you back up your seed.  For peace of mind, you could try sending small amounts to the wallet, then wiping and recovering etc.
Personally I would want to get happy with that *before* taking off coinbase.  The risks of an online wallet are generally long term.  If it's a reputable provider it is fine to leave the BTC there for a bit while you get yourself sorted out.
Welcome to bitcoin.

They will be in your wallet in the sense that you can access them, but they will not be in any wallet you restore from the recovery phrase (or 'seed') they have given you.  You definitely need to have them backed up with a seed.  I have no reason to think it's not OK to transfer all, if you are going to continue using blockchain.info as a wallet.

While your determination to take responsibility for this yourself is extremely admirable, I'd just point out that there is a trade-off involved here.  
If you use something widely-used like Trezor you can be reasonably sure it's tried and tested by many people who really know what they are doing and have spend a lot of time thinking about potential security flaws, not just in the crypto but in the practicalities of using the thing - but there are some risks as you've pointed out in the bitcoin.org link.
If you DIY you may reduce or eliminate those risks.  But you are potentially exposing yourself to a whole other set - and it could be very hard to evaluate them, simply because so few people will likely be doing it the way you have.

Miners will mine the most profitable chain, which depends on the value of the coins on that chain.
The value of the coins on each chain will depend on the market's perception of the future utility of the coin.
The future utility of the coin depends on the existing technology it embodies, plus the expected future technology it will embody.
The future technology embodied by a coin is created by the developers working on that coin.
Mining follows money, money follows tech, tech comes from devs.

You have exactly the right attitude, imho.  It is quite right to feel uncertain about, because it is a new and genuinely revolutionary thing.  Well, actually it's not new, in the sense that we have always had things like money, but it is a different way of doing these things that are so ancient and fundamental that we take them for granted - and crypto makes us look at them in a new way.
Also the entire premise of crypto is that *you take responsibility for yourself*.  You don't need to rely on 3rd parties or central agencies - but that means you do need to rely on your own decisions.  So your uncertainty and caution is exactly what is required.
So, welcome to crypto!  You'll find all the information you need online, of course - but there can often be competing views and sources of information out there, and one of the first things you'll have to do is start deciding for yourself what you believe.  The community in general is very welcoming, and well informed -

@_date: 2017-08-17 20:41:49
the answer is obviously yes
@_date: 2017-08-20 10:22:55
It depends on the trade-off between security and cost/volume of transactions. To take an absurd extreme, 1kb blocks would presumably be very secure, but so small as to be useless.  (A currency built on a coin which allowed so few transactions would probably be not worth much).
So people can legitimately disagree about the tradeoff - which is extremely difficult to judge, I'd have thought.
However what does seem clear is:
* we must err on the size of caution, because we probably would do irreversible damage if we took too many transactions
* there must be some limit to transactions (Roger Ver disagrees, which seems crazy to me)
* we need layer 2 solutions ultimately
So, given the above, right now the obvious approach (to me) is to try segwit and see what happens with layer 2.

Very interesting, thanks OP and lots I hadn't thought of there.
One thing I think I'd disagree with that seems fundamental.  


Markets are dominated by the biggest investors - and the biggest investors have the greatest incentive to be properly informed about investment opportunities.  In the scenario above, I think most informed investors would look at the 'legacy' chain, *supported by the core devs*, with LN etc in the wings, and think that if it was cheap, it was a really good deal.  
I think this is why UASF worked:  it exposed the fundamentals here.  If the UASF chain had been weak, under-mined, and cheap, it would have just looked like a great opportunity to buy the coin with the best fundamentals for a song.  Every major player worked this out, and realised the mining would follow the investment, and so they had to go along with it.  The NYA is arguaby the way they found to do this (perhaps without 'losing face').
This is potentially an amazing thing for the future of bitcoin / crypto / humanity:  that the money will follow the technical expertise, and the mining follows the money, so we will get everything human ingenuity can build for an economic system.
@_date: 2018-10-06 08:40:27
Yes, so pretty unlikely this is the reason - unless bitmain secretly control a vast majority of hashrate
@_date: 2017-08-13 08:32:23
Fixed supply of a currency means effective deflation:  if the economy stays flat then prices of goods (denominated in that currency) stay flat - but if the economy grows then prices of goods will fall.  So bitcoin is effectively deflationary.
If you were a govt using bitcoin to manage an economy, then this would be a problem - most economists think you need low levels of inflation, and most central banks try to achieve this.  
But of course that's not the kind of currency bitcoin is - so I disagree with u/GuyBelowMeDoesntLift that this is a problem, certainly not in the sense of affecting the price of bitcoin.  Most people considering investing in an asset or currency would regard fixed supply as a very good thing indeed.
You're right that if bitcoin is going from $0 to whatever its stable level will be, you'd expect that to be a rocky road, with lots of volatility.

The benefit of 'non mining full nodes' which he completely misses is that they are full nodes, and independent witnesses to the state of the blockchain.  
How many 'mining' full nodes are there - taking account of the fact that it's the number of *owners* that matters.  A couple hundred?  If only miners ran nodes that would mean anyone trying to shut down or control bitcoin would have a much easier job.

:) welcome to bitcoin.
A little more advice, if interested:
- properly work out if you believe in it long term.  If you do, you'll find it a lot easier to handle the inevitable crashes.  Well, a bit easier!
- related to this:  look into the technology and its implications.  It's pretty amazing, probably the most interesting thing I've ever come across.  Videos by andreas antonopoulos are good places to start - the one where the penny dropped for me was [this](  Long, but good even if you just watch the start.  Also look at what's in development - particularly 'layer 2' stuff, esp Lightning Network.
- take care of your bitcoin.  Don't leave them on an exchange.  **Look after your wallet seed**.  See sidebar:

I'm not sure I fully understand your question,  but if you are referring to the fact that mining rewards will decline to zero, it's important also to be aware that:
- rewards will fall to zero around the year 2140 (i.e. a very long time away)
- if btc rises in value, mining rewards also rise in value (before 2140)
- miners also gain transaction fees

They are building their software as they see fit, anyone can run it or not as they wish.  Just like any open source project.
It would not be good at all if miners did all the voting - mining is, and always will be, much more decentralized than users.  Fortunately it seems that users and nodes have the power - see UASF.  Ultimately miners will follow the money, and the money will go to the most useful and secure chain - which the market believes is the bitcoin chain running core.

It depends what you mean by "backed".  In the context of currency it normally means some physical resource that is guaranteed to be provided in fixed ratio to the currency.  So no, bitcoin is not backed by anything (no modern currencies are, that I know of).

I believe the wallet.dat files are what you need, they have the keys etc.  Not sure if you need to get your node running again to access your coins - others will tell you if there's any way to sweep into an SPV wallet.
It's not a good idea to write keys down, I'd say, but do back up the wallet.dat files asap (encrypted).
In the end you probably want a hardware wallet eg trezor or ledger to store offline

(I see from below you mean 2x or core.  We already have segwit, and the question now is whether to fork to double block size)
Core.  I think the main determinant of a coin's success is likely to be the dev team (which of course is related to the security point).  Seems to me bitcoin's dev team is in a different league to any of these others.

In a way, the problem is that "noobs" have too much information.
Unless you are very technically informed (I'm not), you have to take on trust anyway that the private keys give access to the bitcoins at the corresponding addresses.
But seeing that you're having to take things on trust, knowing about individual keys is really not that useful.  All you really need to know and trust is that the seed gives access to the bitcoins at (all) the addresses in the wallet.  If it was explained that way initially, there would be far less confusion.  It's partly a historical accident, I suspect.  In future wallets may be explained to people as basically one big super key which accesses all the bitcoin in it.
Fundamentally bitcoin is far simpler than eg fiat money, or most of the things we use like phones.  It's just that it's new and people (rightly) don't take it on trust like they do with fiat, and they care more about assurance than phones.

No, it's the size of the mempool - the pool of transactions from which blocks are made.  So every time a block is found, its transactions are taken out of the mempool and there is a drop on the y axis.


Remember you aren't looking at specific transactions, just the aggregate.  So you can't say if transactions are 'staying queued'.  It's quite likely all transactions are being processed, and none are staying queued.  But new transactions are entering the mempool all the time.  After a block is found, the bands will start filling up - including with new high fee transactions.  
@_date: 2017-01-06 17:32:45
A few issues with this.  First the bad guys have to be in your street for that to work.  On the internet there's a lot more bad guys can see you.  Second, if bitcoin gets more valuable in future, you'll still be on record as having had 72 of them.
Can't find the post now but someone on r/ethereum lost bitcoin apparently because an ethereum forum was hacked and they found out who this guy was, socially engineered his mobile provider to send 2FAs to a fake phone - and then cleaned out his coinbase account.  The point being that this is a load of effort for a random punter but if you have reason to believe someone owns crypto, it could be worth it.

No doubt there are some scammers about but to my mind, if the reputation system or whatever can be made to work, this is one of the most exciting potential applications of bitcoin - because anyone in the world can raise finance from anyone else.

The 12 word seed phrase is basically a big number (represented in words according to a particular scheme - as per the link I gave).
That single number can be used to generate a lot (infinitely  many?) of private keys - [using the HD protocol](  So all you need is that one seed phrase and you can regenerate all private keys.  Pretty cool.
I don't know about blockchain.info particularly, but I'd expect their 12 word seed to work like this.
@_date: 2016-12-26 21:13:30
Also worth knowing that all you need, probably, is the protocol that was used to create your wallet.  These protocols are all just math processes, and if there is any remaining record of the one you used, it can be reproduced.  Because math is math now and its not going to change.  If you use a popular wallet now it is extremely likely there will be some record of it in the foreseeable future.  (If you recorded the protocol math in the blockchain it would exist forever!).

@_date: 2016-12-26 18:15:53


Nobody really knows, but it is pretty hard to imagine plausible scenarios where anyone could 'stop' it.  There are no central servers - the blockchain (which records all transactions) exists on thousands of computers all over the world (these are the 'nodes' you ask about). 


All you need is one miner to approve it.  As long as you pay sufficient fee, then even if one or a few miners have a personal grudge against you for some reason (pretty weird scenario already), then all the others will still be including your transaction in blocks.  If you don't pay enough fee it might not be picked up by anyone and you have to take some action - eg re-broadcast if you still want to do it - but most wallets automatically set fees such this is v unlikely (tho you can have delays in busy times).
The point of a miner is to provide the "proof of work" that makes it effectively impossible to go back and rewrite past blocks (which is the main way to cheat).  
To mine a block you have to make huge numbers of calculations, trying to guess the correct "solution" for the transactions you are including - there is no short cut.  (see below for more on this guessing).   If you go back and rewrite a block in order to cheat, the original solution is no good (as there will be at least one different transaction).  So you have to start guessing again and re-do the work for the block.  Even if you manage this, the rest of the network is still adding blocks, and you have to do your own versions of each of those (as the solution to each block also depends on the solution to the previous one).  The rule in bitcoin is that the longest blockchain is regarded as the valid one.  So if you want to go back and rewrite a block, you need to overtake the 'true' chain.  To do this you need more computing power than the rest of the network.  One of the beautiful things about bitcoin is that if you do have this much power, you'll make much more money by mining honestly than by cheating!
This "proof of work" is what makes the whole thing work - and the main innovation of bitcoin.  


They make blocks, by gathering together transactions that have been broadcast to the bitcoin network.  Remember, to a computer these transactions are just numbers (because everything is a number to a computer).  They then take the seed of the previous block - which is also a number.  Then they add a third random number (the "nonce"), and put these 3 numbers through a calculation (a hash) that gives a completely random output.  They are trying to find a nonce that gives an output within a certain target range.  It's extremely unlikely that any individual nonce will do this, so they have to try more guesses.  Lots more, and there is no way to work out the solution - it's blind luck.  If they get lucky, and find a nonce that gives an output in the target range, they are able to broadcast the block they have made.  The network of nodes will check that it's valid, and that the nonce does indeed give a result in the target range.  The miner also gets to include an additional transaction, to him/herself - this is the block reward, currently 12.5 bitcoin.  


Nodes hold copies of the blockchain.  It doesn't really exist elsewhere, so they're fundamental.  They pass new valid transactions around (so miners can pick them up).  When a miner broadcasts a new block, it's nodes who check and accept it and add it to the chain (and send it around between each other).  Web sites like [blockchain.info]( are basically nodes with a fancy front end that lets you see what they are doing.  You can see the blocks, plus you can see the new transactions coming in (fast!).

It's like the internet.  The whole point is that you can take any route.   Nodes will have very little economic power.  There's almost no barrier to entry.  In fact, any hodler with bitcoin they want to put to work making a bit of money could use it to make channels and host a node - or lend the bitcoin to someone else to do it.  I expect this to be very decentralized because every hodler is already halfway to running one.

Yes, the 12 word phrase is everything.  Pretty incredible that if you know those words, it is exactly the same as having that money, just stored in your brain (though just relying on your brain is probably risky!).
Not sure what you mean that it is dumb to use "this phrase" on a Trezor.  If you mean that you should not keep bitcoins in a HD wallet after you've regenerated it.. ..well I guess it depends on if you have concerns about whether it has been compromised.  I'm not an expert, but if it was me I'd probably feel the way you do, and want a brand new wallet for storing a large amount.

Hash functions take as input any number (no matter how big), and output a completely random number (with a given number of digits) that depends totally on what the input was.
So if you input the ascii code for "War and Peace" by Tolstoy (about 580,000 words) you might get the output
    93776535632933262985656999274747977782463727827286
Now change *a single letter* and input that instead.  You will get something *completely* different, like
    67724648537867567458974936955857937928426965667964
The way mining works is that you need to find a combination of inputs that gives a number *under* a certain threshold.  For example, suppose your threshold is:
    00000000000000000000000001000000000000000000000000
You will have to make a whole lot of tries - all random - before you get an output that is under this number.  But, importantly, anyone can easily check you got it right, by just running your solution through the hash function.  
That's how it works in mining.  You can try it out yourself with this [online tool]( which actually uses the same function as bitcoin hashing.

I still tend to believe that miners' incentives will continue to sort this out naturally. We have never had &gt;50% for any significant period, afaik, because miners know they lose revenue if there is fear of a 51% attack.  It's hard to see how that would change.

Imagine keeping score in a game of cards by giving yourselves 100 points each, and writing down when anyone wins or loses.  
That's all it is, and if it's secure, this is actually all you need for a currency.  But you do need lots of clever crypto to make it secure so nobody can cheat by giving themselves extra points, or writing fake transactions to themselves, or deleting previous transactions (i.e. double spending).
@_date: 2016-12-27 05:19:53


Miners take what they can, and fill blocks to make the most fees possible.  Nothing they can individually do to get more for a given block - as they are getting as much as is available.  In the longer run we would expect miners to do what they can to maximise the fees they get.  This is a controversial topic.  Personally I believe this is a good thing, as the revenues for miners directly determine the amount spent on mining and therefore the security of bitcoin.  In my opinion, if there are not fairly substantial total fees from transactions, bitcoin will become insecure and could fail.  Others have different opinions (see r/btc where many proponents of these views post).


Don't use bitcoin for transactions - there are alternatives.  Worth knowing, though, that most people believe bitcoin can enable effectively limitless, free transactions by supporting additional layers built on top - particularly the "Lightning Network".  In this vision of the future (which I agree with), relatively few transactions will need to be on the main bitcoin blockchain.  


It's only run by people in the sense that people are miners and node owners.  It's a kind of very efficient democracy, really.  In terms of manipulation, as long as miners behave in a self-interested way, they will support the network - this is the whole point and the genius of Satoshi's invention.  As long as there is sufficient mining power (which is why fees are important), manipulating the network would take a huge effort - probably needing covert fabrication of ASICs on a huge scale - and it is very unlikely this would ever make any money for anyone, so the only really conceivable scenario is that it's done for political reasons, by a Government.  But any Govt doing this would presumably be wanting to shut down cryptocurrency as a whole - and would need to be prepared to go on and play whack-a-mole with whatever takes over from bitcoin.  
These are definitely scenarios worth thinking about.  IMO they are all pretty unlikely as long as there is sufficient security and mining power in bitcoin (hence why I think fees are good).

From the article cited:




@_date: 2016-12-26 11:39:33
Yes, most hardware wallets use standard recovery systems which mean you don't rely on the wallet maker.  Eg Trezor uses [bip39](  A bunch of other wallets use this too, so if Trezor go bust you can recover to their wallets.  Also if everyone goes bust, you can recover your private keys yourself I believe.
Most people here will say you should never use an online wallet company.  If you don't hold your keys you don't own your bitcoin.  They can go bust or whatever any time and you are SOL.  There are some situations where maybe online is OK if you are very unsure about having your own wallet.  But it's really not ideal at all and everyone who owns bitcoin, certainly for any period of time, should take the steps required to hold their own coins.  It's really not hard at all.

Well there are, and they are an important part of the incentive for miners to spend all this money securing the blockchain.  The amount of reward they get per block is decreasing - which is why the total amount of bitcoins is limited at 21 million.   So the incentive will depend more and more on the transaction fees they earn (all transaction fees are collected by whoever mines them). 


Yes, but these days it is virtually certain you would never actually find a block unless you have specialist hardware (ASICs).  Originally just Satoshi was mining on his laptop or whatever.  Then others joined also on their normal computers.  Then someone worked out you could do it a lot more efficiently on GPUs.  Then, as the value of bitcoin went up, people started designing and using dedicated chips just for mining.


Just download some software and run it on whatever rig you choose.  But it is an extremely industrialised process, with razor-thin margins.  Unless you have one of [these]( you are unlikely to make more than you spend in electricity.

The relationship is the other way round actually.  The amount of transaction fees is determined by how much people are willing to pay for their transactions to be included in a block.  The amount of electricity used to mine the transactions follows from that.
@_date: 2019-10-14 19:21:21
Mining activity will diminish, with miners turning off equipment (and the difficulty of finding a block will adjust downward) until cost of electricity (actually the full variable costs of mining) equals the expected value of transaction fees.
It would certainly be a problem if there were not enough fees to incentivize a safe level of mining.  But that situation would only arise if bitcoin had failed anyway - otherwise you'd expect a lot of fees.

@_date: 2016-12-26 17:33:47
Yes, this how it works in general.  The seed is all there is to protect - which is the whole point of doing it this way.  
However there are some different protocols used for seeds - and you can only recover a seed in wallets using the same protocol.  I had a quick search to see if I could tell which protocol Electrum uses, but it wasn't totally obvious to me.  Others on this sub will know far better than me, and the information should be out there.  Sorry I can't give you a definitive answer.  But you've got the general principle right.  
Final point:  as long as electrum is open source (which I believe it is), and the source code is not lost, then you will always be able to recover your bitcoin, whatever happens.  In the worst case where you have to work it out for yourself it would be a huge pita, but electrum is a widely used wallet so it's pretty hard to imagine you'd be left doing this on your own!

Best to start with understanding the function of the blockchain.  It's really simple and the other stuff makes much more sense when you get it.
Imagine you want to play cards with your friends, but nobody has cash and there's no convenient things like matches to use as chips.  But you have a piece of paper and a pen.
So you credit yourself with $100 each, say, then play, and whenever someone wins something from someone else you record that, and change the amounts you each have.
This is the basic function of the blockchain - and the units are called bitcoins, rather than made up dollars.  It's a ledger that records transactions.
All the rest (mining etc) is just a way to make sure the ledger can't be faked.

Two things:
1.  You absolutely must move your coins from coinbase to a wallet you control - otherwise you don't own them.  
2.  You first need to understand for yourself how to do that safely.  There are trade-offs involved.  
Good wallet options to look at are:
- hardware wallets (which cannot every go online so are more secure in that sense) such as trezor, ledger.  
- the electrum desktop wallet
- samourai for android
- greenbits for iOS

Yes that's what they are designed for. But they are obviously connected to the internet, so less secure than something like a trezor which stays offline. Most people would use a phone wallet for everyday spending, but not for storing large amounts.
Also it's vital to take care of your seed - 12 or 24 words that can be used to restore your wallet if you lose the phone or hardware device. They are more than just a password, they really ARE your wallet. That means also that if anyone steals them they get your bitcoin, so be careful!

Bitcoin's value comes from its utility - just like anything else.  The primary (linked) utilities of bitcoin are as a store of value and as a medium of exchange.
I suppose you could say that some part of this is related to electricity - because electricity is required for mining to validate transactions - but it's a very indirect relationship.  Also note there are many other inputs even to mining - capital and labour - let alone all the other factors that give bitcoin utility, such as the network effect etc.
In fact you might as well say USD has value because of the electricity used to create it.  This is also partially true, because without electricity it wouldn't work, as currently designed - but it is just as misleading as saying "bitcoin has value by the electricity which is used to mine it".  Worth noting also that electricity is just a way of achieving aspects of the bitcoin design, just as it is way of achieving part of the USD design - and in principle both could be changed if necessary.
How'd I do!?

Key thing is, imo, any solution must be based on an understanding of the system - not just:  "fees are high, we want them to be low, so let's stop having a blocksize limit".  Because you will only break bitcoin once, there's no ctrl-z for that.
The number one priority must be decentralization.  Without that, there is really no point in the whole thing - paypal or whatever would be much more efficient.  At some point big blocks would threaten decentralization, so we must be very very cautious.

2^256 is an inconceivably huge number.

@_date: 2017-11-04 19:01:05
The cost of running a node is an increasing function of the blocksize.  So every byte of blocksize increase will increase the cost and mean fewer nodes.  Obviously there is a trade-off going on - the optimal blocksize balances the need to support transactions, with the need to maintain decentralization.
I'm not aware of any quantitative analysis of the optimal blocksize - but, crucially, it is pretty obvoius to me that the main chain can never scale to safely accommodate all the transactions people may want to make (which must include micro and nano transactions).

If there is a premium it must be because there is some impediment to arbitrage with the world bitcoin market. Lots of things this could be: eg regulation / corruption in Venezuela stopping international capital flows or adding costs to transactions.

It's all about decentralization.  That is the only really important thing that distinguishes cryptocurrencies from fiat / normal currencies.
If a cryptocurrency is successful, one day vested interests will come along and try to control it for their own ends - just like banks control the mainstream financial system.  That's exactly why bitcoin arose in the first place.  Ultimately the critical attribute for a cryptocurrency is whether it can resist that attempt.  And the defence is decentralization.

I read a fairly plausible theory that satoshi was Dave Kleiman - Wright's business partner.  This would explain why Wright did appear to know stuff from very early on - but couldn't eg move satoshi's coins.
Kleiman died a few years ago, but the theory is there's a USB with satoshi's keys on it, which one of Kleiman's heirs now has.  By raising his profile in connection with satoshi Wright might have been trying to establish some sort of paper trail in preparation for making a legal claim to the satoshi USB.

The device itself is just a convenient way of 1) generating and 2) using private keys.  But it's the private keys (embodied in the seed) that matter.  So all you need worry about, ultimately, is the seed - you can use it with any of a number of different wallets (or even make transactions yourself using open source software libraries, if it comes to it).

Yes.  It's going from zero to some equilibrium state - and this can only happen with large lurches up (mainly) and down. 
FWIW I think the progress from 0 to 1 is fundamentally about information transmission.  At 0 only satoshi had any information.  At 1, the entire market will have made a true calculation of the utility and value of bitcoin.

As blocks get bigger, fewer and fewer people will be able to run nodes.  The fewer nodes there are, the easier it is to attack bitcoin or for Govts or vested interests to control it.
The block size at which this gets critical is not clearly known, I believe.  But core are proceeding on the basis of caution, for one thing because it's probably pretty hard to go back from an excessive block size.  I personally agree with this approach.
Also for bitcoin to survive there must be some economic constraint on the amount of transactions that get stored in the blockchain - which, remember, is the eternal ledger that must be preserved and maintained in perpetuity.  All that comes at a cost to someone, and if people were able to fill up the blockchain with whatever they liked, at no cost, pretty soon everything would fall apart.  So a 'fee market' where a limit on blocksize means users must bid for blockchain space, and face some of those costs, is absolutely essential imho.

I'm talking about prices, in the sense that $3 for a gallon of milk is the price of a gallon of milk.  A deflationary currency, where the money supply increases slower than economic growth (which corresponds with demand for the currency), leads to lower prices for goods valued in that currency.
You are talking about the "price" of $1 valued in numbers of gallons of milk.  Which will indeed go up in the above scenario, obviously.

People often refer to the seed as a "backup".  But it's not really accurate.  It is the information required to identify all your public addresses and all the corresponding private keys.  So it *is* your wallet.  You might "back up" your wallet, by saving your seed in multiple places.  (Or, before this kind of wallet was invented, when wallets were just computer files you would "back them up" with copies on USB or whatever).
But none of these kinds of "back up" refer to your transactions.  Nobody ever needs to back up their transaction history because that's the whole point of the blockchain.  If you know your public addresses (that is, if you know your seed), then you just need to look at the blockchain to get your transaction history.  Which is exactly what wallet apps and devices do.
Does that make sense?  It might be worth finding out about public and private addresses, and the blockchain and transactions if you find this confusing at the moment.

Text below, my emphasis.
Alexis Tsipras should never have hired Yanis Varoufakis as his finance minister. Or he should have listened to him, and kept him on. But instead the Greek prime minister chose the worst of all options. He followed Mr Varoufakis’ advice of rejecting the offer of the creditors — until last week. But having done this, Mr Tsipras committed a critical error by rejecting Mr Varoufakis’ plan B for the moment when the country’s banks closed down: the immediate introduction of a parallel currency — IOUs issues by the Greek state but denominated in euros. A parallel currency would have allowed the Greeks to pay for their daily transactions when cash withdrawals were limited to €60 a day. A total economic collapse would have been avoided.
But Mr Tsipras did not go for this, or indeed any other plan B. Instead he capitulated. At that point, he was no longer even in a position to choose a Grexit — a Greek exit from the eurozone. The economic precondition for a smooth departure would have been a primary surplus — before debt service — and an equivalent surplus in the private sector. Greece has no foreign exchange reserves. If the Greeks were to reintroduce the drachma, they would have had to pay for all of their imports with the foreign exchange earnings of their exports. These minimum preconditions were in place in March but not in July.
So, like his predecessors, Mr Tsipras ended up with another very lousy bailout deal. And this one suffers from the same fundamental flaws as its predecessors. This leads me to conclude that Grexit remains the most likely ultimate outcome after all.
There are three principal ways in which this can happen. The first is that a deal is simply not concluded. All that was agreed last week is for negotiations to start, plus some interim financing. A deal might fail because principal participants themselves are sceptical. Wolfgang Schäuble, the German finance minister, says he will keep up his offer of a Grexit in his drawer, just in case the negotiations fail. Mr Tsipras denounced the agreement on several occasions last week. And the International Monetary Fund is telling us that the numbers do not add up, and that it will not sign unless the European creditors agree to debt relief.
The Germans refuse any discussion on this subject, citing some trumped-up rules according to which eurozone countries are not allowed to default. This is legal hogwash, but I suppose the purpose is to describe new red lines in the negotiations.
My hunch is that they will ultimately fudge a deal, but that will come — as it always does — with overwhelming collateral damage: less debt relief than needed, and more austerity than Greece can bear.
A more likely Grexit scenario is that a programme is agreed and then fails. The Athens government may implement all the measures the creditors demand, but the economy fails to recover and debt targets remain elusive. Mr Tsipras already agreed last week that if this situation arose, he would pile on more austerity. So, unless the economy behaves in future in a very different way from the way it behaved in the past, it will remain trapped in a vicious circle for many years to come. At that point, Mr Tsipras, or his successor, could concede defeat and opt for a negotiated Grexit as the least painful option. Grexit could also be forced on them by the creditors.
**My own most likely Grexit scenario is a different one yet again. Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, hinted at this in his interview with the Financial Times last week when he said that he felt “something revolutionary” in the air. He is on to something. The most probable scenario for me is Grexit through insurrection. Give it another three years, and I would not be surprised to see Mr Tusk and his colleagues in the European Council having to entertain even more drastic action to quell a crisis.**
Greece is not quite at the point of insurrection yet — despite eight years of recession. Opinion polls still reflect a majority of the people in favour of keeping the euro. In real life people choose between a small number of political alternatives and settle for the one they think works best for the economy. They voted for Mr Tsipras and his Syriza party in January because the other parties failed to deliver. If Syriza fails to deliver, too, as it surely will, the Greeks will have no democratic choices left.
Can Mr Tsipras still avert disaster? If there is a snap election in the autumn, he might well win it and then revive Mr Varoufakis’ parallel currency idea at some point. But I think the parallel currency moment has gone with the man. My hunch is that Mr Tsipras will run a rabble-rousing political campaign, with a lot of rhetoric against the creditors but then agree to whatever the creditors are demanding, and follow the programme to its dramatic climax.

People do value internet access, which these companies provide - they value it greatly.  The problem is that the companies are able to exclude competition, because of the nature of the market for internet provision, and charge prices significantly above their costs.  The excess profits they generate then makes it economically viable for them to corrupt lawmakers, fix the rules and generate even greater profit.  
That's not about govt control of money - it's more like money (or wealth) controlling govt.

It's not intended that you download the entire blockchain - just recent blocks.

@_date: 2015-07-01 08:47:05
Well it currently costs 150BTC per hour just in mining, obviously - a cost borne by hodlers of bitcoin.  But also a transaction on the blockchain has to be maintained essentially forever (in the sense that if it is to have value, it and its successors must be maintained).  That includes revalidation, storage across all nodes, rebroadcasting between nodes, all the normal network functions and security.  Forever is a long time, and so even small costs become much bigger.  These costs exist, and someone has to pay them - fact.  If the beneficiaries (i.e. the parties to the transaction) don't pay then there is a risk that the people who are forced to pay, though they don't benefit directly from them (ie currently hodlers and those who run nodes altruistically) will one day decide it is not worth it, and will stop - at which point bitcoin dies.
Put it another way.  Everyone says (rightly imo) that when a country or company talks about doing their own blockchain they are being stupid - because if you don't need it to be decentralized, it is much more efficient (cheaper) to just use a centralised spreadsheet.  
There are obviously tradeoffs to be made here, hodlers and nodes will rationally subsidise up to some point (it seems ok at the moment) and I'm not qualified to hold a view on the correct tradeoff for RBF etc.  But it seems to me that denying the existence of these completely inescapable costs just means we risk the whole thing.

Thanks for considered reply.
I interpret what you're saying as an analysis of the trade-offs, which concludes that the costs of transactions are not large enough for us to seek to impose them on the users who make the transactions.  To this extent we are in agreement - that there are tradeoffs which need to be considered.  My interpretation of the debates over eg block size is that they amount to just this:  an evaluation of the tradeoffs.
As I said, I don't feel expert to come to a conclusion on those tradeoffs.  But I would point out that your analysis does rest on some assumptions which might easily not be true - and if they aren't, they could imply a different conclusion.  In particular you make assumptions about transaction volume which, it seems to me, are highly open to dispute.  If bitcoin "catches on", not just as money but as somewhere to store information immutably forever, we could see a far greater increase in transactions.  I think the basic principle of the blockchain is so utterly revolutionary that we cannot begin to conceive of its uses.  
Overall, if forced, I'd probably agree right now that the best thing is to leave transactions as cheap as we can.  But I just cannot believe we'll be able to do that forever - and I think it is right that devs are not just taking it for granted that we will.

Not sure this is an issue.  It's the same as taking that amount of cash from an ATM, keeping it in your wallet for the period - and forgoing (or incurring) interest on it.

Off line is what you want for large sums, long term.  Quite a few ways.  Hardware like Trezor (get it from the right place) and Ledger are good.  Or there are various ways of creating wallets / addresses on an offline computer.  A simple example is bitaddress.org.  You can download the code, run it on an offline machine (or even in an OS booted from a USB) and it makes addresses.  Get them stored, eg printed, then wipe everything you did on the machine before re-connecting to the internet.
This stuff will all get easier but right now it's a bit of a faff.  A way to reduce the stress and increase security is just to use several independent ways and split your funds.
Also multisignature can be very safe.  Coinkite and copay do that. (Oh, maybe greenaddress?)
I'm not an expert, but you should find plenty of good info if you search here and google.  I think the simplest properly safe way if you're not initially confident is Trezor, though it costs.  Myself I actually went through the process of an off-line armory wallet.  Super secure, but it was a lot of effort.  However I learned loads and am really glad I went that way, gave me confidence in the whole thing.  If that appeals, then go for it.

Well, it looks like it could be a good hedge against risks in the mainstream financial system - eg price responded directly to developments in Greece. That's how I got into it.  If that's your reason, its worth buying coins yourself, and keeping them yourself - because the situation your hedging against (extreme version!) is one in third- party institutions break down.
If it all takes off, it seems likely the price would rise enormously. But it is a step into the unknown, so worth finding out all about it and making an informed decision before committing any serious funds. And make sure you can keep coins safe.

The principle of basically unconstrained blocks - imo a crypto cannot scale to support global payments and stay decentralized if every tx anyone ever wants to send has to be seen, verified and curated by all network participants forever.  It just doesn't make any sense.  There has to be a constraint, and the market solution is fees.
Secondly, as a result of the above, it seems to me basically the only people left developing and promoting bcash are pretty flaky.  The bitcoin (and layer 2 bitcoin) devs seem to me the elite.
Thirdly, also as a result of the above, bcash has very low hash rate, so must be considered pretty insecure.  To do a 51% attack on it you only need something like 3% of total SHA256 hash rate.

BU are proposing to hard fork and **kill the remaining chain**, using mining power.  We are into semantics now but I don't see how this can reasonably be described as anything other than an attack.
The only question then is which side you're on, which determines whether you consider yourself as subject to the attack or not.  I am on the side of core etc, and my viewpoint and wishes for bitcoin are under threat of being obliterated by mining power.  So yes, I consider this an attack.
For what it's worth I'd be perfectly happy for EC to HF and see which wins, and would not support an EC fork being deliberately destroyed by mining power.  So I think there is a difference.

No, this has been possible forever.  Mining has always been optimally efficient in one big pool - but of course that would be a threat to bitcoin and it's price, so miners and pools have always naturally sorted themselves out to avoid this level of centralization.  It does not explain Bitmain's opposition to SW.

Bitcoin is currently divisible to 100 millionths, but that limit can be changed easily - so in effect it is infinitely divisible.  
That means we will never run out as long as there is some nonzero quantity remaining available, so no reason 'mass adoption' is affected.  
The only other effect of loss of bitcoin is to increase the price.  Arguably that's beneficial for 'adoption' as people see it is an appreciating asset.

Imho its not hard to tell who is expert in this field, and they are mostly against blocksize change, for reasons which make perfect sense to me.  The counterarguments seem to amount to wanting things for free - because free things are just nice - and not actually giving thought to the economics of this system.
So I don't know if most users want a blocksize increase, or what your source is for that assertion.  But I'd think that most users want bitcoin to survive and grow in value and to my mind (and those who seem to me to be expert) that has to be incompatible with unlimited blocksizes.  What the actual right size now is I can't judge but we must be cautious and not risk the only thing that gives  bitcoin value in the end, which is decentralization.
Also it does seem to me there are vested interests promoting BU who stand to gain by holding bitcoin back or controlling it.  It's not particularly unfair, to my mind, to refer to these as enemies.
@_date: 2017-04-30 08:42:41
That's the most persuasive explanation for supporting BU I ever heard - thank you.
Personally I don't agree, as I put a lot more weight on the negative consequences of excess blocksize - which I genuinely think is the biggest internal risk of bitcoin (in the sense it's something we can control but we can fuck up).  To me layer 2 is essential if bitcoin is to be used for everyday exchange, so the obvious path is SW first, then LN and then see where we are and plan blocksize increases as appropriate (as per the chat logs).
I also fear that, while there may be well-intentioned and well-informed people such as yourself supporting BU, the project is being used by people with not so good intentions to achieve other goals, as well as people who seem really not to understand what they are talking about.  I am a professional economist fwiw and some of the things I've heard Roger Ver and others say indicate to me they are dangerously ignorant of basic economics - which is what a lot of this is about.  
But anyway, thank you for explaining your views, I understand a lot better now why people can reasonably support BU.

No!  As I've tried to explain have formed no conclusions about it, and do not judge it at all.  Maybe it's great.   But it's pretty clear to me that it's not relevant right now because what's actually happening is an attack by the dominant miner (dressed up as something to do with EC, but pretty clearly it's not).
After the attack has resolved itself one way or another, then will be the time to decide how to manage scaling, and compare EC with alternatives.  But right now the priority has to be the attack.

I also think its relevant that, as we move to more renewables / solar (which seems inevitable), there's no meaningful concept of depletion of the earth's energy resources.  The actual energy available to us is effectively infinite, so it becomes a cost just like any other - and the underlying resources whose scarcity is relevant are just capital and labour, as with any other economic activity.

I think there is still this potential issue that if someone deliberately sends you some 'dust', Trezor will not allow you to avoid spending it.  That means it will provide a direct trace that allows the sender to follow your transactions thereafter.  See [here]( for more.
If that is an issue, one would hope that Trezor provide some functionality for addressing it, in due course.

You seem to be saying that knowing the network map (which bitcoin nodes / users don't need to do, but LN nodes might) is somehow equivalent to the scaling issue of needing to store and curate all network transactions in perpetuity (which bitcoin does, but LN doesn't).    
@_date: 2018-03-15 08:39:41
It depends.  If you want to bet on the price of bitcoin, and trust that your counterparty (and the mainstream financial system) will make good on your bet and cash you out in fiat if you win, then this sounds fine.
If, on the other hand, you are interested in bitcoin because it sits outside the mainstream financial system, and want to own bitcoin with the prospect of using it as a peer-to-peer currency that cannot be censored or corrupted or arbitrarily taken away from you by corrupted institutions, then this is not going to do the trick.
@_date: 2018-11-08 16:17:18
I wouldn't worry.  Govts have been banning currencies for as long as there have been govts and currencies.  It never works.  The US even physically confiscated its citizens' gold within living memory.  And it's a lot more difficult to actually stop people using bitcoin than gold or any fiat currency.
Going further, I actually think that if a major govt was ever foolish enough to declare it was going to actually kill bitcoin this would be great - it would fail, and the world would see that bitcoin is a stronger and more durable institution than government.
@_date: 2018-11-08 13:52:01
No, my point is that even if 'politics will make it illegal' - which I think is certain anyway - it would not matter.  It is simply implausible that any human institution could kill bitcoin.  Maybe make it inconvenient to use in some countries for a while, but that's it.

Someone made the bitcoin protocol.  The bitcoin protocol is what requires mining to generate new bitcoins.  Making the bitcoin protocol is different to making bitcoins using the protocol.
All bitcoins can be traced back to when they were generated.  When you send bitcoin to anyone else, their wallet checks the history of the bitcoins received, and will only accept them if they obey the rules.  Anyone can easily "program some more bitcoins", but this would break the rules of the protocol, so nobody else would accept them and they would be worthless.

No obvious limit.


Not sure I follow but on chain fees will always exist (and it would be problematic if they didn't).  There are lots of things in development aiming at massively reducing the frequency you need to transact on chain in order to use LN - eg look up 'channel factories' and 'splicing'.


You can store them anywhere you like, and no they are not stored on chain.


It won't and it's not intended to.

The expected cost to mine 1BTC will always be 1BTC.
@_date: 2018-11-08 13:43:49
In principle the only way you could 'improve' the energy efficiency in terms of BTC worth of electricity per BTC would be to change to some alternative PoW which required other resources instead.  Why you'd want to do this is unclear - as it's still resources being irreversibly consumed.  Otherwise you have to abandon PoW.
To change the $ worth of electricity per BTC mined, of course you must 'change' the price.  The higher the price, the more electricity will be used per BTC.
What's most interesting to me is that, even if we all agreed that bitcoin used too much energy, there would be nothing we could do about it.  This is not something 'we' are in control of - it is happening *to* us, like it or not.
It's a clear indication of the power of the game theoretic structure of bitcoin - which is enough to cause a non-trivial proportion of our planet's resources to be used in a certain way, whether anyone wants that or not.
TL;DR resource use in mining bitcoin really depends only on the price of bitcoin - and there's nothing anyone can do about it

Yes, I agree.  Objectively bitcoin is far superior in almost every way (the only exception is if we actually lose electricity / communications).
But people value gold or anything else because of trust, not objective arguments - and that happens slowly.  This is very exciting though because right now we are at the point where only 0.001% of people trust bitcoin.  It will be pretty amazing when the realization dawns on people that it's not going away, and it can be trusted.

Interesting dynamic (which I didn't think of) is that if you're a big blocker thinking of spamming the network now you will be less likely to as it significantly increases the incentives for using segwit.

Govts have been banning currencies for as long as there have been govts and currencies.  It doesn't work.  If the currency is better, it survives and is used - especially by the govt themselves.
But anyway, this ban of yours would require worldwide co-ordinated action.  It's already banned in all sorts of places (now and then), to not much apparent effect.  And how would govts even know that people were using it?
If you think bitcoin can be banned then really, what is the point of it?

@_date: 2017-09-14 19:51:20
It's a good question, in a way!
I was going to say that it's just like any other asset like company stock - that you could basically never buy it all.  But then I realised you *can* buy all the public stock in the company, because of the way boards and governance is set up.
So I guess its more like gold.  What would happen if someone tried to buy all the gold in the world? 
It's also important to know that bitcoin would work if there was *any in circulation at all* - because it's ultimately infinitely divisible.  Right now the smallest unit is a satoshi, a 100 millionth of a bitcoin.  But even if Jeff bought all the bitcoin but one satoshi, that could be divided into a billion smaller units.  (Would be quite odd tho!).

The agreement was between a bunch of CEOs.  IMO this is no different to Verizon, AT&amp;T, Comcast etc getting together and trying to force a change in http or whatever.
Also seems pretty clear a major objective of many of these CEOs was to fire the core devs and replace them with a more compliant team.
So it's not a question of whether 2Mb or 1Mb is right.  It is far more important than that.  It's a power struggle for control of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-24 12:48:41
No, I don't think fees are too high.  Of course, we would all like everything in life to be free, but it isn't.  Space on the most secure, eternally uncensorable record humanity has ever created isn't free - it requires resources for a tx to be preserved indisputably forever, and if users don't face those economic costs they will over-use the blockchain and it will eventually fail.
I want fees to be as low as possible, while ensuring the number 1 priority of decentralization.  It's blindingly obvious to me that bitcoin cannot scale on chain in the way we want - not even to visa levels, but we want much more than that.  So we need to try layer 2 solutions and ensure the main blockchain is safe.
If safe levels of use mean it's uneconomic to buy tacos with bitcoin, then so be it.

My guess is they "accepted" segwit before it was forced on them by UASF.  The 2x bit was widely described at the time (not by them!) as a way of saving face - and looking like they had power when they didn't.  That's being shown again, I think (and hope).
"Too late".. ..to back out?  Most of them have backed out to some degree already, in one way or another - eg bitmain and Ver saying bcash is the true bitcoin, implying 2x isn't, and even coinbase saying it will list current bitcoin as BTC after the fork, when it was supposed to be a clean move straight to the new protocol.  And it's not like it was a legal commitment.
@_date: 2017-09-18 07:15:48
We would expect this to happen all the time.  Miners will invest right up to the point at which their rewards from mining equal their costs (or just less).

Investors assessing the future utility (and therefore demand) for the alternative coins.  That is based on the current and expected future tech.  It determines the market price.
That determines the allocation of mining resources - as it directly sets the (real) level of mining rewards.

Also the proof of work requirement means you *can* 'trust anyone's backup' as long as it has the required work - which you can easily verify yourself.  This is the whole point of the blockchain and Satoshi's invention that makes this all possible.

It's a good question, in a way!
I was going to say that it's just like any other asset like company stock - that you could basically never buy it all.  But then I realised you *can* buy all the public stock in the company, because of the way boards and governance is set up.
So I guess its more like gold.  What would happen if someone tried to buy all the gold in the world? 
It's also important to know that bitcoin would work if there was *any in circulation at all* - because it's ultimately infinitely divisible.  Right now the smallest unit is a satoshi, a 100 millionth of a bitcoin.  But even if Jeff bought all the bitcoin but one satoshi, that could be divided into a billion smaller units.  (Would be quite odd tho!).

I clicked this thread hoping to see a response from you, Erik, and perhaps some clarification of your position on 2x and the issue of replay protection.  I'm really disappointed that you commented but did nothing to address that.
A lot of us find it very difficult to see why a 2x hard fork now, which would have the effect of imposing the decision of a group of CEOs on bitcoin, and changing the developers, would be a good thing.  Could you make a comment here to give your views and maybe address this concern?

Although if bitcoin goes to the moon then it **is** quite easy to see it taking up a nontrivial proportion of the world's energy use.  More interesting to me is:  even if we all agreed this was a bad thing, what could be done about it?  Nothing.  It is not controlled or controllable.  It's something that is happening to us.  If you buy in to bitcoin you are buying in to giving away that control (though of course it's too late even if you don't buy in to it).
Also as the world moves to renewables, as seems to happen (and must happen one day), then the question of the relative proportion of global energy is kind of meaningless - as we make as much as we need.  It's still important, of course, if significant resources are being devoted to generating that energy, but it's not like bitcoin is going to deplete the sun.

@_date: 2017-09-27 13:06:13


I had this thought today.  Right now, these CEOs are not responsible for bitcoin - and if pressured, they can legitimately say it's beyond their power to change the protocol.
But **after 2x they would have shown they do indeed have the power to change the protocol - and so might reasonably be held responsible for it by law enforcement**.  Apart from obviously being the end of bitcoin as we know and love it, I find it hard to believe the CEOs actually want this.
The whole thing seems completely mad to me.

2. I don't think they really mean it
3. Successful corporate attack, eg 2x.  Unexpected failing of basic cryptography.  Meteorite wiping out life on earth.
4. Satoshi made it that way - some other cryptos don't have one, most do - it is what it is.  Bitcoins are infinitely divisible, so there can never not be enough coins.  Their value will go up if people keep wanting them.
Your summary is not far off - good job.  Here's a load of links to more info:  
Best way I found to explain it is:  imagine you're playing poker as a kid, and you don't have 'real' money, so you keep score on a bit of paper.  Maybe you all start of with $100 and when people win or lose you record that, and people's resulting amounts.  Bitcoin is exactly that, no more no less - the blockchain is just a ledger for keeping track of bitcoins moving between people.  Only thing is the scores on the bit of paper can't be faked or edited etc.

Well, if it became apparent that a small group of CEOs could meet in private in, say New York, and decide on a change in the protocol, then they'd probably just call them up and find out what threats or inducements would be required to get them to implement whatever regulations they wanted.
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:20:57
The reason this attempt to change the bitcoin protocol must be resisted is the reason we need bitcoin in the first place.
Companies will naturally seek to exert any control they can over the system they are working in.  That's why Verizon, Comcast etc try to control the internet - and why Goldman Sachs, Citigroup etc try to control the financial system, ensuring it is beneficial to them.  
I'm sure many of the NYA CEOs genuinely think they're doing the right thing - that they will wield this power for the good of users.  But all companies were startups once, even Goldman Sachs - and it is natural, and inevitable, that sooner or later they will use any power they have to enrich themselves or their shareholders.
This natural rent-seeking is *exactly* why bitcoin was invented.  If bitcoin is to succeed, it must be resisted.

I disagree.  Everyone needs to know where power lies - and to know that it does not lie with these companies.  That way hopefully they will devote their future efforts to serving users and not to these futile - but incredibly wasteful - adventures.
And are you suggesting that, after all this, "Core" should do something they think is not technically justified, but which would allow the attackers to "save face"?  No way, thank god.

Suppose a farmer has a field near a town. People like fireworks and lets say she's confident 100 of them are willing to pay at least $10 each for a show. It would cost $500 to buy the fireworks so she'd make $500, and people would get to see a show they value at more than $1000. Everyone wins - the market in action. 
But something is wrong. The farmer sees this and realises she can't put on the show - she'd lose money. The show doesn't happen and the people are deprived of the enjoyment they'd have had.

I actually think most people in both subs are fundamentally connected by a common fear that bitcoin will be subverted by vested interests.
Typically r/btc think that core devs are doing this subverting, as they (some of them) work for a company, Blockstream, who they accuse of manipulating bitcoin.  Personally I find that difficult to accept from what I can see of the diversity of devs, and the sincerity and obvious competence (to my mind) of the devs who post here.
Right now r/bitcoin suspects the NYA agreement to be an attempt to control bitcoin.  Personally I more or less agree with this - at least I think that, even if NYA signatories don't have this explicit objective, if their will prevails they will have effectively taken control of the protocol as a result of a backroom deal.
The best thing to do, obviously, is try to be open to alternative views and make your own mind up.  While avoiding as much unpleasantness as you can (which is a major reason that put me off r/btc)

No, on both.  
Any transaction will be valid on both chains.  Say you want to broadcast on legacy chain, and send a tx as normal.  It goes to your intended address, to which someone has a private key - all fine.  But someone could mischievously copy this transaction and broadcast it on the new chain.  It will be valid for sending your (new) coins but will go to an address that nobody has the private keys for - so you will lose those (new) coins.  The same is true in reverse if you want to make a transaction on the new chain.
If I understand correctly.

1. Miners don't, nodes do.  They check every transaction in each new block, and reject the block if any are wrong.  They also can stop false transactions from circulating even before getting into blocks, I think.
2. False transactions fail.  If they don't get into a block, they don't really exist.
3. Transactions are checked to see that they are signed with the right cryptographic (private) key.  This uses "public key cryptography".  It's an incredible thing - you should read about it.

Bitcoin is designed so it doesn't matter.  If it depended on altruistic miners it would be completely pointless.

@_date: 2017-10-06 07:26:22
Well I don't agree with your characterisation of UASF, but even if I did, it's still clearly different.  It may have had support of some businesses but it originated, it seems to me, from users - and gained its strength (and achieved its success) exclusively from users running nodes.
Also note that merchants who accept bitcoins are very different actors to businesses who mediate bitcoin transactions.  The latter are the concern as they have ability to control and subvert the network - as we see with ISPs.

The main problem I (and most people here) have is that it is a decision taken by a group of CEOs, in private.  
If it is possible to make such fundamental changes to the protocol this way, it's very bad news for bitcoin.  For example, Governments would know where to go to try to get changes implemented.  
Probably more relevant is that if these CEOs have such power, we should expect them to use it to attempt to control bitcoin, in order to exploit it as much as possible.  This is very similar to the situation with ISPs seeking to control and exploit internet use.
Related to this is the apparent desire of many of the CEOs to "fire" the core devs - who, it seems to me, include most of the best engineers and cryptographers around - in order to replace them with a more compliant team.  At the moment they only have 1 recognised bitcoin dev working on their fork.
Personally I see this as the first of probably an unending series of attacks on bitcoin by vested interests seeking to control it - just as Verizon, Comcast etc naturally seek to control the internet.  Fortunately it looks likely to fail: there are futures markets for the new coins that would be created, and these seem to show the market puts a low value on them.

You’re missing the point. The most compelling argument against 2x, by far, is that it was decided in a backroom deal between CEOs. If that’s all it takes to fundamentally change the protocol then Bitcoin is over. 
And no, we shouldn’t run Bitcoin as a business. Unless we want it to be PayPal.

This is wrong in all sorts of ways.  JP Morgan's value isn't from transmitting money (and nor, necessarily, is bitcoin's). 
Better to look at value of gold.  Maybe 50x that of bitcoin, when it does the same thing far worse - and bitcoin does much more.

You always had an infinite number of "currencies" to choose from, in the sense you can exchange anything for anything else.
I can see that perhaps there is a class of "things" which are particularly suited for use as currency, and *perhaps* if you had more units of these things, the total currency supply would increase in a way that might be somewhat meaningful.  But in the case of crypto (as well as fiat), I'd say that happened long ago - there are already an effectively infinite number of crypto units.  What matters is if they are demanded - and bitcoin is demanded less, which would mean its price would fall.

If you mean that the CEOs *are* the economic majority, that's like saying Verizon, Comcast etc *are* the internet.
And note, Verizon and Comcast aren't seeking to 'destroy' the internet.  They're - perfectly naturally - seeking to control it in order to extract as much rent as possible from it.  Which is exactly what these bitcoin CEOs will want to do.

lol not btg (that's bitcoin gold, right?  a much more obvious scam, certain to fail)
I mean:
- a large majority of hashing power moves to the 2x fork permanently, and
- a majority of exchanges list the 2x fork as bitcoin, and
- investors value the 2x chain significantly higher than the current chain, and
- core fail to pull of a PoW change or whatever is necessary to separate the two blockchains
I think probably none of those will happen.

It doesn't go to zero at 8Mb, but it gets harder / more expensive as block sizes get bigger - as blocks require more cpu power to validate, more bandwidth to transmit and (probably less important) more disk space to store.  Whether right now that's critical or not I couldn't say - but the point is, the bigger blocks are, the greater these costs are.  
At some block size (after a period of time), a basic personal setup will not be able to keep up with verifying blocks and transactions (not to mention the initial downloading and verification of the entire blockchain if anyone wants to start a node).

@_date: 2017-10-27 18:36:54
It's the same - armory is a wrapper around bitcoin core I think.  But if you're not using the wallet, may as well just use bitcoin core.  Oh also armory makes its own database (or used to), which takes up a lot of additional disk space.
You won't have wasted anything though - the blocks you've downloaded should be useable whatever you end up doing, I think.

I disagree - it would have been forced on miners sooner or later.  They probably knew this.


Maybe but the fact is we should expect vested interests, who are part of the "community", to attempt to control it.  Eg you could certainly say ISPs are part of the internet community - but should we try to agree with them and make a compromise on net neutrality in order to be united?  Being disunited is better than compromising on the protocol with vested interests who are trying to control it.

There is a relevant Seinfeld episode where Kramer says he's going to cover his apartment with wooden decking.  Jerry bets him $50 he won't.  A few days later Jerry asks about it, and Kramer says oh, no, I decided not to - the bet's off.
Jerry says: the whole point of the bet is that I knew you were going to decide not to.  And that's the whole point of these futures markets.  If you believe the fork will happen, you would make a killing by betting on it.  The fact people need a 7x return to make that bet shows people think it won't happen.

Wider point, to my mind, is that this is all part of the governance of bitcoin.  There are no structures, committees, boards - so it is gonna be messy.  IMO the truth comes out though.

You've started to do that.  I'd advise finding out more about the tech, and *why* people believe it will be valuable, before making your own decision.  
[This]( is a good place to start.

You're right.  The bigger bitcoin gets, the harder it will be attacked by vested interests seeking to control and exploit it.  We will see if it can survive.
My guess it will be a kind of whack-a-mole, with corrupted forks going off, and attempts to kill the original, just like we're seeing here.  If the 'true' bitcoin survives, it will be basically invincible.

This is exactly what many/most govts in the world do - willingly, and for good reason.  Every country that ever pegged to USD, every country in the euro (which is a peg to the deutschmark, in effect) is doing it precisely to cede power over monetary policy to a more credible authority.

r/Cryptocurrency has plenty of discussion on things like that - though watch out, lots of people pumping things there.
@_date: 2015-04-02 08:38:54
Yes.  But note there is a strong interaction between these functions.  If bitcoin (or any asset) is useful for exchange, it also becomes attractive as a store of value - as it means it is likely that someone in future will be willing to exchange some other asset for your bitcoin.
This is the "intrinsic value" in all currencies and everything ever used as money - including, substantially, gold.
So your first scenario begets the second.  Note also that once people start also using bitcoin as a store of value, the expectation that people will exchange other assets for it in future increases.  There is a strongly co-operative effect in your second scenario.

If Satoshi sells his coins, it's a one-off event.  And what happens the day after?  All the fundamentals are the same as they day before.

This is not a problem.  All wallets will give you a "seed" - a sequence of 12, 18 or 24 words, which you can use to regenerate the whole thing if you lose your phone (or if the wallet developers disappear, or whatever).
Phones might be a bit less secure from hacking than a dedicated hardware wallet like Trezor, particularly if they are rooted, but for many people they are OK.  
(Of course, you need good security on your phone to make sure anyone who steals it can't get your bitcoin - but that should be easy enough)

Just be sure to say that bitcoin is primarily a protocol that enables the internet to be used as an autonomous payment network, with no need for third parties like banks or governments, so individuals can transact directly with each other.
Bitcoins, the tokens, are needed for this to all work, but the whole thing is much harder to understand if you start with the tokens.
Could also say that the reason this all works is fundamentally the blockchain - an immutable, eternal, unforgeable record.  One use is for payments but there are many more.
Edit: in fact I'd start with the blockchain, which is the fundamental novelty.  For the first time in human history there is the  possibility of recording something indisputably, forever (google James d'angelo on this).  Then say one use is it allows autonomous payments, etc.

Most everything's going to have computing power and storage, so why not make a network out of all of it.  One big mesh computer, all connected by bitcoin.

Well, hardware wallets are specifically designed such that it is impossible - at the hardware level - for your private keys to be exposed to the internet.  I'd really advise you to consider them.  Most people here regard them as extremely secure, if used properly.
Remember you have to go 'online' at some point, to broadcast your transaction - even for a paper wallet.  But the crucial issue is whether your private keys are ever exposed.

Wrong that mining is a natural monopoly and will be centralised.  
Miners are profit maximisers, depending on bitcoin value for income.  Any market perception of centralisation will reduce bitcoin's value, and miners' income, so you'd expect them to naturally self-organise to the optimal level of centralisation which minimises costs but doesn't undermine trust in bitcoin's security.  Which is exactly what we observe.
@_date: 2015-04-06 23:25:26
It really won't.  Bitcoin is different than fiat because its decentralised.  Big corporations could try a decentralised coin with a blockchain (corpcoin).  But what would be the point when bitcoin already exists?  And if its not decentralised you might as well have fiat, or a single database rather than a blockchain.

I think people overestimate this greatly.  1M is ~7% or whatever, but it's a one-off event, for obvious reasons.  There might be a large drop if liquidity is low, but as long as people's perception of the long-run fundamentals don't change, they will see this as a chance to buy at below the long run price, caused by a failure of the market to clear properly.  Personally if this were to happen I would definitely be looking to buy.

Agree miners act in own best interest, but the system is designed such that this means serving users.  If that aspect of the design fails, I think bitcoin will probably fail - it will become no different to the current financial system, ruled by vested interests.
(Fwiw I'm not at all convinced big blocks are in miners' interests.  I suspect they were motivated by "firing core" and establishing control over the protocol).
As soon as you start making allowances for the "grievances" of attackers by compromising the protocol, I think it's the beginning of the end.  
I think you have an overly rosy view of these people.  While many of their followers may have meant well for bitcoin, I have no doubt that the leaders were seeking control for their own ends.  Probably they themselves even believed they were taking that power for good reason, and they would use it justly.  But it wouldn't matter - sooner or later it would be abused, either by the individuals themselves or by their successors, put in place to wield that power in the interests of the company and its owners.
I am glad the core devs have been so resolute and uncompromising.  This type of attack will be incessant for as long as bitcoin is successful, I believe.

Nodes *are* the network.  When you send a transaction, it is picked up by a node (a computer on the internet running the bitcoin client software), and re-broadcast if it is valid.  
Miners tap into the network, and group together transactions in blocks.  When they are successful in mining a block, they broadcast it back to the network.  Nodes check the blocks to make sure all transactions are valid - which includes tracing their history through the blockchain (each node has a copy).  If it's OK, then the nodes all update the blockchain, adding the new block.
Nodes pretty much are bitcoin, you could say.

Yes!  Genuine use case where it beats fiat hands down already.  No way am I giving my personal info to paypal to sell on so I can donate a couple bucks to someone.   I always look out for bitcoin donations and always give something if I used something.  More and more people taking it too.
Also anything you buy where don't need it posting to your address.  Even if I wasn't a bitcoiner, this is completely obvious that I don't want to be handing out my credit card if I don't have to.  And why should I have to?
Also this week I got my credit card turned down twice, just because of anti-fraud algorithms.  Had to call them to confirm I hadn't been hacked or whatever.  Getting to be normal that sometime it works, sometimes it doesn't.  Plus I get an email from my bank advising me of downtime when I won't be able to access my account.

Agree - for each block, miners will want to include as many fees and tx as possible.
But setting the block size is a different matter.  Miners will want this set such that, when they do mine a block, the total fees will be as high as possible - and that is likely to mean restriction to drive the price per byte up.  
One way to look at this is that they want to collude to keep fees high, by restricting supply of block space.  They cannot do this this on an individual block level, as you point out.  But they can do it by agreeing a restrictive block size that then limits every miner's individual behaviour, ensuring co-operation.

Hey guys.  Can anyone tell me the activation requirements for SegWit?  I know it's "95%", and vaguely assume this is of blocks mined over some recent sequence, eg last 1000 (?).  If that's right, then what's the sequence length?  Or is it 95% of something else?
If it is some sequence length case then presumably 5% hashing power is not enough to block it - as you will not get 5% of all sequences of 1000 blocks (or whatever it is).  If that's the case, then has anyone done the statistical analysis for how long it is likely to take for ViaBTC to get unlucky enough that SegWit activates?

I agree supply and demand "work" to the extent they will determine the fee, for a given block size - just as they "work" to determine the volume for a given price level.  But I don't think this affects the conclusion.
Miners' *marginal* costs (i.e. cost per additional tx) will certainly affect their minimum fee - and it is not impossible that this might "bite" such that the effective block size is lower than miners would want as per the logic in the OP.  In other words, they can't get to the sweet spot because that would entail lower fees than they need to keep afloat.  But intuitively it feels quite unlikely to me.

Well, coinbase will be running a node if that's what you mean. 
A node holds a copy of the blockchain, and accepts new blocks according to the protocol rules. Nodes share information about new transactions and blocks, and compare versions of the blockchain between each other and settle on the correct one. That's an important part of the security of bitcoin. 
It also means that if you run a node and have the blockchain stored on your machine, you can check for yourself if transactions are valid. You don't have to trust anyone else like coinbase.

Worth noting that paying by credit card means a fee of maybe 2-3% the merchant  has to pay (and which must get passed on in prices in the end).  Bitcoin fees are flat rate, normally 2 cents or so I think.  So expect to see discounts for bitcoin if/when this all gets going.

The unexamined premise in this argument is that increasing blocksize is the correct (or only) way to scale.  To my mind this is premise is completely wrong, and attempting to scale on chain would destroy bitcoin.
The "outcome" you want, Jeff, is not transaction fees or block size, but *decentralization*.  It might be harder to measure but it's all bitcoin has that the current financial system doesn't.

Welcome.  Make sure you know how to look after your bitcoins.  Don't leave them on exchanges - they don't belong to you until you have the private keys.  If you have a significant quantity then it's definitely worth buying a hardware wallet - eg trezor, ledger and a couple of others.

There is a neat circular effect where the more established bitcoin gets, the more bitcoins are worth, and the greater the incentives for mining and the greater the security.  If bitcoin gets less used and turns out to not be relevant for the future, then there will be less security.. ..but also therefore less to gain for anyone attacking it, and less for us all to lose (as it wasn't working anyway).
Eg the price rise the last few weeks has fully offset the halving to come next year (assuming it holds!).
In the long run, it's arguably likely transactions on the main chain will become more expensive - and most activity, which doesn't need the absolute gold standard security of the main chain, could happen with networks built on bitcoin, such as lightning and sidechains.  Just imo, I'm no expert.

I don't believe Bitmain really want bigger blocks tbh.  If asicboost works, and bitmain are able to keep it to themselves, and segwit would stop them then I don't see what "doesn't add up".  You'd expect them to do anything they can to protect their position, including lie about wanting bigger blocks.  I mean I don't know what's going on, but what Bitmain say, eg in that post, simply doesn't stand up imo.  
That HK agreement, my understanding is it was misreported and "Core" didn't agree anything - have a search, nullc has explained from his point of view - I can't remember the details but thought it was pretty convincing at the time that this was bs.  Not saying you should believe me but do have a look and make your own mind up.
The "new consensus" seems a total nonsense to me.  What have they actually agreed?  If they want segwit why not just activate it rather than re-engineer it in some dubious sounding way, with some code to be decided (and not currently existing in any form)?  And anyway Roger Ver says he didn't sign it, and various people have been saying it means completely different things, eg HF first then SW.  A nonsense it seems to me and makes me think we need to ditch this dealmaking and consensus among a select few, and UASF.  But that also seems potentially really risky.
Scary times, but it helps (me) to remember:  this is one huge experiment in evolution, and whatever mutant does emerge from the lab, it won't have been carefully planned out.

Harsh, esp considering you posted it!  For such a mainstream source I thought it was well informed and pretty balanced - and the question you quote was largely a rhetorical device, to give the answer yes.
@_date: 2015-11-09 17:50:08
I think many reasons this wouldn't work.  Interesting to think through tho.  Half baked thoughts below.
To start with, let's consider what happens if you just have a "lowest reward" wins.    That means nodes running code which accepts blocks with the smallest reward, and abandoning proof of work.  The whole point of proof of work is to stop attackers adding fraudulent blocks, as it is expensive to make a valid block(chain).  Now anyone could trivially make winning blocks, and the network would be very cheap to attack.  So unless I missed something, that's a non starter - right?
But what if you keep PoW, but then say, for example, each node waits for 10 valid blocks and accepts the one with the lowest reward (no idea if that is technically possible).  I haven't been able to think this all the way through, but it seems quite possible to me that rational miners will bid rewards down to approaching zero.  Certainly, the *repeated* selection of the lowest reward, from the distribution of ten, feels to me like it would cause a permanent (as in continuing forever) reduction in the winning reward.  
The amount miners rationally spend on mining will ultimately be equal to the value of the rewards.  So if this approaches zero, then the spending on mining will too - and you end up with zero security (forgetting transaction fees).
My feeling is that any competition based on lowness of reward may have these properties of continually reducing the actual reward.
You could argue that transaction fees are enough (one day they will have to be).  Looking more historically, I think that the reason for the block reward is really bootstrapping the system.  Bitcoins have value if the network works for transactions, and transactions only work if people mine, and people only mine if they get rewards.  The block reward pushes forward that value to the miners who get it off the ground, so that transactions can happen.
Finally, I'm not sure I agree that the halving lacks freedom.  You need some incentive structure for the bootstrapping.  To my mind, the market has freedom in how it reacts to and equilibrates around that structure  - though it's actual design (halving every 4 years) is somewhat arbitrary.  The fact is you need some (arbitrary) bootstrap structure - it just has to be openly known.  For example, just because the rewards are stepped, we should not expect significantly stepped hashing power - as the market foresees and anticipates the stepping, and should smooth mining investment accordingly.  No miner will wake up the day after halvening and think - right, now to work out how much I should invest now that rewards have halved.
One last thought, I'm not aware any of the thousands of alt-coins who've experimented with different reward formulas have had better success than bitcoin in this respect (though I don't know if your formula has actually been tried).

I don't believe Bitmain really want bigger blocks tbh.  If asicboost works, and bitmain are able to keep it to themselves, and segwit would stop them then I don't see what "doesn't add up".  You'd expect them to do anything they can to protect their position, including lie about wanting bigger blocks.  I mean I don't know what's going on, but what Bitmain say, eg in that post, simply doesn't stand up imo.  
That HK agreement, my understanding is it was misreported and "Core" didn't agree anything - have a search, nullc has explained from his point of view - I can't remember the details but thought it was pretty convincing at the time that this was bs.  Not saying you should believe me but do have a look and make your own mind up.
The "new consensus" seems a total nonsense to me.  What have they actually agreed?  If they want segwit why not just activate it rather than re-engineer it in some dubious sounding way, with some code to be decided (and not currently existing in any form)?  And anyway Roger Ver says he didn't sign it, and various people have been saying it means completely different things, eg HF first then SW.  A nonsense it seems to me and makes me think we need to ditch this dealmaking and consensus among a select few, and UASF.  But that also seems potentially really risky.
Scary times, but it helps (me) to remember:  this is one huge experiment in evolution, and whatever mutant does emerge from the lab, it won't have been carefully planned out.  From that pov I kind of think bring on the forks etc, lets see what happens.  I'm kind of glad what I think doesn't matter tho!

Well it seems to me bitcoin is all about rules that constrain the free behaviour of individual market participants in order to create a system that works.  Eg the 21m, the rule of no double spending - both of which are constraints we probably all agree are a good thing (and of course can choose to change and see if consensus agrees).  From this perspective the current blocksize is another rule, though obviously not everyone agrees it is desirable.  But without rules that constrain individuals, there is nothing.

If we had SW and tried LN and it was clear we needed bigger blocks then the whole community would be for them and the pressure would be irresistible.  But seems to me the overwhelming majority wants to get SW &amp; LN going first and then see what we need.  
From that perspective, stopping SW means stopping bigger blocks.  Which I think is perhaps what Bitmain actually want.

For me, any uncertainty means that a blocksize increase shouldn't be considered until all other options had been exhausted.

Most people in the world have no banking, let alone access to global markets on the internet.  Bitcoin give them that (among many other things).  
The utility to do this (and the other things) means people find it useful to own.  So it has value.  As soon as it gets value it can become self-fulfilling, like gold or any other currency is.
Another question:  why does USD have value?  (apart from the fact you can pay taxes with it - I think there is more than that, especially as it has value to non US taxpayers)

Not saying this negates your argument, but LN etc will not be as secure and trustless (and immutable?) as the main chain.  If people want that extra stuff, they will still want to use the main chain, and will pay for it, presumably.
I think it is possible to imagine circumstances where, depending on the demand for main chain transactions, you might want to *reduce* the block size to maximise the tx fees.  I guess this is a way of seeing the small block argument:
* Individual miners may rationally include very low fee transactions - if the marginal cost of to them of including a transaction is small, compared to the fixed cost of mining a block
* Actual fees are set at *the minimum* required to get in a block (more or less) - i.e. the market rate
* This might result in total fees per block being sub-optimally low, and an insecure network
So, even though miners want to maximise fees per block, the economic structure of the market means they are individually incentivised to undermine that objective and drive total fees too low.  It's a classic game-theoretic problem (can't think which).  
The way to overcome such a problem is to co-ordinate to agree binding rules - such as exogenously limiting the block size, to maintain fee levels.
Also, all this is based on the premise that lack of (total) tx fees is a problem that threatens security, which arguably it might not be for a century, depending.

@_date: 2015-11-29 10:44:01
I'm no expert.
If you can break SHA-256 you can do things like mine blocks (and create valid fraudulent blockchains) without proof of work - which relies on the fact that only brute force can be used to solve blocks (find a nonce that gives a hash of the block which meets the difficulty target).
If you can break ECDSA, you can create valid transactions from public keys even if you don't have private keys - so steal everyone's bitcoins.
My understanding is that these things are considered impossible in any meaningful time frame.  They aren't special to bitcoin, they're fundamental tools of crypto, used widely.  There's talk of quantum computing maybe being able to do some of it one day - but I don't think even that leads to the worst case scenarios above.  Like I say, not an expert.

Yes, but even this still needs huge infrastructure (I'm not sure if you mean physical cash - if so, then that's not enough, we need a non-physical payment network).  Hard to put an exact resource cost to it.  But point is there will be one.  And my guess is will be much greater than doing the equivalent with bitcoin - especially after a few more halvenings.
@_date: 2016-05-21 16:02:45
What the other answers perhaps have not made clear is that miners choose which transactions to include in the blocks they mine.  And (if successful) they get all the fees of all the transactions in the block.  
So the bigger the fee you pay, the more likely miners will choose your transaction for their blocks.

It will increase demand slightly - as you need some amount of bitcoin to transact.  But it's really that there is greater interest and importance in securing the whole thing - which in turn makes the token more secure and more valuable.

@_date: 2017-05-26 23:13:36
Do you think transactions should be free?  If not then what should determine the fee?  
We absolutely must have fees that mean users face the full economic cost of their transaction - which includes maintaining it in the eternal ledger *forever*.  I'm not sure what that fee is, but if it's too low then we will end up with an unmanageably large blockchain which can easily be subverted by vested interests, and there will be no way back.  So imo we must err on the side of higher fees.
@_date: 2015-11-07 10:11:46

Yes, but what's gold "backed" by?  Most people will say you can make jewelry out of it.  Fair enough - it has an additional use, which gives it value.  But that's only a tiny fraction of its value - the rest is as a store of wealth and (less these days) a medium of exchange.  
To come to my point, why does something need *two* uses to have value?  It doesn't it only needs one.  Bitcoin has one - its use as a medium of exchange (or, maybe more precisely, as a means of using the Bitcoin network).  That use is what gives it value.  Fiat currency the same - the utility as a means of exchange (including for paying taxes) gives it value.
TL;DR: things are backed by their intrinsic value, and utility for exchange is the intrinsic value of bitcoin (and fiat).

Bitcoin is a complete payment network - including the facility for transactions, and the unit of currency.
Any payment network, with any currency, requires resources to validate transactions and secure balances.  Other networks, especially those based on fiat currencies, do this involving bank buildings, vaults and firewalls, tellers, system admins, accountants, lawyers etc.
In Bitcoin all these functions are rolled up into proof-of-work mining (and the network of nodes).  It is almost certainly far less resource intensive than any other viable alternative, including existing systems.

It is really about who controls bitcoin.  For one reason or another the interests and wishes of users and miners seem to have diverged.  Users mainly want to implement segwit, while miners don't.  As originally released, segwit requires 95% support by miners.  Now that it looks like miners have decided not to support it, UASF has been designed as a way of overriding the original release mechanism, and activating segwit anyway.
As I say, users mainly seem to want to implement segwit.  It is a technical update required for "second layer" solutions like Lightning Network (LN), which you may have heard of, which are built on top of the main blockchain.  If it works, LN would allow bitcoin to support essentially unlimited instant transactions, basically for free (with a few conditions, which seem minor to me).  Segwit would also allow more transactions to be fitted into a block, so it would give a one-off increase in capacity, and reduction of fees.  Most developers related to bitcoin seem to agree with this (and it has been implemented in other coins, notably litecoin).
A powerful group of miners, led by Bitmain, who also are the largest makers of mining equipment, does not want segwit and has blocked its implementation.  It [has been suggested that this is because they have a "covert" way to increase mining efficiency - known as "ASICBOOST"]( which their competitors can't use, but which would no longer be possible if segwit was implemented.  Bitmain have, essentially, [admitted that their chips can use this advantage - but claim they are not](
Another possible reason miners, or their supporters in the wider community, might not want to activate segwit is that they want a different way forward for bitcoin - with bigger blocks, rather than through second layer solutions.  I won't get into that now but it is also a very important and complex discussion.  However it is important to note that implementing segwit does not stop bigger blocks - it's not really related.  But it does make it a huge bargaining chip, which I am guessing is why some people like Roger Ver don't want segwit unless they get bigger blocks in return.
Hope that helps.  I've tried to make plain factual statements, but should say that I support segwit etc, and you might get differing representations elsewhere.

Don't get me wrong, I am entirely opposed to bcash etc.  (Well I don't care it exists but I do think its scammy).
But anyone can call anything whatever they want.  If Ver wants to call his coin bitcoin, that's fine - I respect his right to say whatever he wants.  The only problem is when he knowingly sells it to people who think they are getting something else.

The UASF would definitely mean people would need to have their wits about them and know what's going on.  But this is bitcoin, where you have to take responsibility for yourself, and can't rely on central institutions - that's the point.
It's important to recognise that this is an exercise which determines who controls bitcoin.  Is it the miners and companies who reached "agreement" in NY?  Or is it the users who run nodes.  My opinion is that if users cannot have ultimate control, power will be centralized in the hands of a few big companies and dealmakers - which will make it no different to a national currency.  So I think it's probably worth the risk, though others whose opinions I respect disagree with that.  It's very difficult, but also pretty exciting - we're watching evolution in action here.

Good listen, but I think varoufakis, while he talks the talk, about how brilliant the bitcoin solution, doesn't make any substantial arguments to support his overall scepticism.  
The main problem with his position is "the vanity of wishes".  He doesn't like bitcoin because it means govts lose monetary policy.  I personally agree with him that a deflationary currency would probably be bad.  But he moves from his dislike to asserting that it won't happen.  There is no logic in that.  Bitcoin will happen if people decide to use it - end of story.
Also I infer he doesn't like the fact that early adopters would get very rich.  Again, irrelevant, even though he might not like it.

You can't use a 51% attack to create invalid transactions.  All you can do is use it to enforce a different history of valid transactions.  
The classic is the double spend attack.   Suppose I send you 1BTC in payment for a car.  The tx goes in a block, and you give me the car.  Then I create a fake version of that block, in which the 1BTC goes back to me.  It's all valid still, all the signatures are correct, it's just the 1BTC goes to a different address.   If I have enough hash power I can build on this fake block and make the longest chain, and the network will accept it as it's all valid.
@_date: 2016-10-26 19:25:22


Not necessarily.  When volume increases, tx fee to get in a block will decrease.

Depends entirely on perspective, IMO. What economics is really good for - but sadly is seldom used this way - is understanding the really deep shifts, as phenomena move to equilibrium which are not obvious when you are in the melee of everyday life.  Things we take for granted as they have always been this way, but actually are only this way because of certain conditions.. ..and when those conditions change it is a proper economist who will recognise this and believe in logic and say that the world is going to change.  This is why I am into bitcoin :)

You're right about all this, as far as I can see.  Many thanks, I appreciate your effort 1 beer.
That crediting transaction (TX A) was from an armory wallet, to a trezor - the address you identified above.  Armory shows that TX has failed.  The trezor has registered the receipt, however, as the TX B.  However I tried to send another transaction, back to armory, (the one which which failed) *before* the time TX B was received.
So as far as I can tell, I have the bitcoin still in my trezor.  Which is OK. 


Do you mean I should re-broadcast the raw transaction, eg using coinb.in?  And I'm not clear what you mean by sync.
However, as I'm only doing this between my own wallets, can I just ignore it?
Thanks again

We will look stupid if we come to an agreement which results in bitcoin being controlled, exploited and ultimately destroyed by vested interests.  The problem that bitcoin solves (we hope) is that centralised power will always end up being abused by "agreements" and compromises that look politically attractive or easy, but which ignore the facts and science of how the system in question actually works.   If decentralization is compromised by an "agreement" it is all over, imo.

Economist here (with a science PhD too).  Economics is *nothing* if it is not a science.  It can certainly be a science if done correctly - basically you have to rely mainly on logic and theory, as observations and experiments are so difficult.  
Unfortunately, due largely to the difficulty of observations, professional economics is rife with charlatans.  There is a culture of never saying "I don't know", and instead reciting some specious (probably gratuitously technical) rubbish which is then defended to the hilt.
Economics is mainly information theory - as every economic transaction or action can be regarded as a game of sorts.  I have been massively impressed and humbled by the expertise and rigour of crypto / information people involved in bitcoin.  These guys are the real economists, and they are scientists too.

I have found it is MUCH easier to talk about the blockchain, and how that is going to revolutionise the global economy and society, because of what you can do with an immutable indisputable eternal ledger.  And there is lots to say about this.  One of the things you can do is have a peer to peer currency, Bitcoin (which is also essential for the blockchain itself to exist).
It is amazing how much more interested people are, and how much more easily they then understand bitcoins.  You also don't feel like your trying to convert them or anything.
@_date: 2017-05-23 07:24:10


Will depend how valuable they think the coins wd be, vs what they could earn from mining on other chains.  Plus how long they'd have to mine to find a block.  Afaik there will be no difficulty adjustment, so if there's only 1% of the hashpower it will take 100x as long to find a block.
Overall I probably agree with you but there's a lot going on.

Problem is, I genuinely think, there is nobody credible to argue meaningfully against someone like Andreas - that is, against someone who credibly makes the 'pro bitcoin' argument.  Your left with morons and shills like Jeffrey Robinson.  That's because the pro bitcoin argument, if made with appropriate objectivity, is not substantially refutable.
I don't mean arguments like: bitcoin will be worth a million bucks in 10 years.  No serious pro-bitcoiner would say such a thing.  What  they will say is, eg, open source peer to peer networks for exchanging value can change the global economy in ways we cannot yet foresee, such as xyz but who knows.  There is no credible argument against such things - so you don't get anyone credible arguing against them.

"Even a web-of-trust model, which is excellent at detecting suspicious islands of ‘reputable’ users, will not be able to distinguish between real and fake ratings of a Vendor. Why? As discussed, Buyer identities are not disclosed in the transaction summaries (unlike trade receipts, which is necessary for dispute resolution); Buyers are only represented by a bitcoin address. This is the equivalent of a single-use pseudonymous identity that would be the cause of suspicion in a web-of-trust model. That said, a web-of-trust graph based off transaction summaries where the Buyer is known (i.e. the GUID and Blockchain ID is disclosed) would be a useful tool."

I would interpret that to mean you have:
- created a wallet on blockchain.info (all of whose generated addresses are  backed-up by your 12 word seed)
- imported some addresses / keys that were generated outside your wallet (which will not be backed-up)
Do you even have the private keys for these addresses?  Where did you import them from?
I don't know this wallet, and suggest that you speak to blockchain.info about what to do.  It does sound like you have to sort this out and if it involves sending funds to another address you may want to do it before Aug 1.

AFAIK they do something clever to data involving hashing, then put the (much smaller) result on the bitcoin blockchain. So it is part of the eternal immutable record of our civilisation etc.
Pay some fee I'm sure but maybe not a huge use for bitcoins per se. However if the blockchain does become that single repository of humanity's information it would obviously be "good for bitcoin" fwiw. It would become the ultimate standard for truth - so a native unit of value in such a system is likely to be.. ..very valuable.  
That's all just what I'm guessing

Just to clarify which transfer you're referring to:  TX A has gone through, albeit as TX B - and the funds are showing as spendable in the recipient (trezor).  
But will the invalid TX (third one above, in your list) have gone through?  This is when I tried to send them back the other way, trezor -&gt; armory.
These bitcoin are showing as spendable in the trezor, AND as unconfirmed funds in armory.  Will they eventually move to armory?  What if I try to spend them again from the trezor?

For how to store them, see the sidebar, especially the [security guide for beginners](  You almost certainly are looking for a hardware wallet: trezor, ledger or keepkey.
@_date: 2017-07-30 18:36:15
Ideally you want a hardware wallet - trezor or ledger.  Though they can be a bit hard to come by just at the moment.
I gather from other posts that there is no particular issue with blockchain.info regarding the coming fork - as you *do* hold your private keys, so you will have coins on both forks.  The problem with them is more that they also have your private keys, so you have to trust them to not do anything bad.
So if all that's true (don't take my word for it), there's no particular rush.  If I was you I'd probably leave them where they are until you have a hardware wallet.  If you do still want to move them, then electrum probably best, but you need to worry a lot more about security of the computer.  
See sidebar ('basic security') for more.
Your 12 words are, *in effect*, your private keys - in the sense that they can be used to derive all the actual private keys in the corresponding wallet.
@_date: 2015-10-27 17:46:14
BTC is not an input to anything, nor is USD or any token - it's the real stuff you buy with it that is the input, and that doesn't change no matter how many tokens you burn or print.
Other way around, if we decided to make more bitcoin, your saying that would increase capital?

@_date: 2018-04-29 17:54:41
As hanzpanzer says, you still need a clean computer to generate the paper wallet.  So in that sense they really are both the same - except if you use the hardware wallet as your computer it is, I'd have thought, much more likely to be 'clean'.
But also you will need a computer to use or spend the bitcoin, and that can be even more problematic than generating the initial keys.

Bitcoins are, in effect, infinitely divisible (currently to hundred millionths, but that could be changed if needed).
If you google "dead man's switch", I think it is, there are ways you can ensure your bitcoins are paid to some other address automatically after a certain time, if you don't stop them.

Welcome to bitcoin, :)
I use armory, with an offline wallet. Satisfyingly complicated! More important, it gives me confidence - and I learned a lot setting it up.  I was a total noob when I started, so I'm sure you'd be fine. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:47:01
Not necessarily - at some point, maybe soon above 1MB, maybe a long way above, I don't know - you definitely kill bitcoin, as you lose decentralization.  
But I thought there is also the issue here that if you are going to HF you really want it to be planned way ahead of time so it can include all the stuff that needs doing, as HF's will be so rare.

From what you posted here he's talking about sharing the "inflation income" differently.  I don't see where he says anything about increasing it.
So, from this, he's talking about reducing miner income.
@_date: 2017-07-14 07:25:39
Rubbish.  The coins can only move once, after which it's back to fundamentals - and everyone will know this.  So if price falls it's an obvious huge buying opportunity caused by transient loss of liquidity.

This.  Money itself - in whatever form - is an extremely difficult and subtle concept.  But we never usually have to think about it, because we've all taken it for granted all our lives.
In understanding bitcoin most people have to think properly about money for the first time.
Or you can just say, someone will give me goods and service if I give them USD; or if I give them bitcoin.  So whatever the mysteries, they both work as money.

Yes, but the transmission is, I believe, quite wobbly and indirect.  I'm not a monetary economist but I can imagine literally setting the quantity of units of the currency might give far more control.  Though maybe they'd still end up reading the runes in macro data, and then making their best guess of the right money supply, rather than interest rate.
I can imagine it's all rather mind-expanding for them though.

“Sand Hill is the New Wall Street”
Paul Murphy | Mar 10 08:45 | 11 comments
The conceit comes from Silicon Valley, but you knew that already.
Irritatingly, right now we’re in a queue, with 1441 people ahead of us in the wait for access to the future home of finance…
And yet this is not a This is nuts post. [The Sand Hill Exchange]( venture genuinely intrigues us.
Sand Hill is offering anyone who wants to deposit money with the firm the chance to buy and sell synthetic derivatives linked to unlisted tech companies.
Here’s a snapshot of the market action (click to enlarge):
People are buying and selling ‘contracts’ that are worth one-billionth of the supposed value of the company, with a final valuation or strike price set by a liquidity event, such as an IPO, a sale or — well, insolvency.
So, in that snapshot above, Uber is priced at 41.201, which fits with the $40bn valuation reported at the time of Uber’s last umpteen-billion dollar VC round. Have a click round here. Did you know that “Internet of me” wearable tech company Jawbone is worth $3.8bn?
Now, the ‘contracts’ that make this possible are British-style contracts for difference – Cfds. Rather than owning an asset outright, you enter into a contract with a counterparty to cash settle any subsequent move in the price of that asset, up or down.
Cfds are similar to Total Returns Swaps in the US, which are popular amongst hedgies and other professional traders.
But Cfds specifically are illegal in the US — or at least there’s so much CFTC red tape around their usage that they just aren’t used. (And try and get your head around the situation post-Dodd Frank.)
What Sand Hill appear to have done is to simply sidestep the entire 40-year old edifice of the CFTC by using the blockchain, that bit of the Bitcoin infrastructure that acts as a distributed public ledger, for transactions.
Now, it’s still early days. Sand Hill only went live just before Xmas and you’ll see from the market activity snapshot that trading volumes are tiny. Sand Hill is currently limiting investor accounts to deposits of $250 and there’s a 100 per cent margin requirement, so there’s no leverage.
If and when Sand Hill gets proper traction it will of course be open to all sorts of abuse (can you abuse inside information on an exchange outside the regulatory system?).
But you can see the Emoticon here: the Sand Hill Exchange offers the chance to use Silicon Valley innovation to bet against Silicon Valley itself.

One of them will be a change address.  Eg suppose you want to send 0.44 bitcoin.  It's unlikely you have an address with exactly that amount, so your wallet will do something like find an address with 0.55, and send 0.44 to your recipient, while returning 0.11 to an address you control.
I don't know what S and U stand for.

@_date: 2015-02-02 14:44:08
No, the cost of mining is determined by price of bitcoin.  In the end miners will spend 1 BTC per BTC.  If price is $200, they will spend $200.  If it's $1m they will spend $1m.  
If miners spend more per bitcoin than a bitcoin is worth, they they lose money and go out of business.  If they can mine one for less than it's worth that means there's free money lying around so more mining capacity will come on line.  So in the end it always equilibrates towards the market price of bitcoin.
Price of bitcoin is determined by supply and demand.  Supply is fixed.  Demand is how useful people think it is / will be.

Terrible idea.
@_date: 2017-07-31 21:08:51
yeah it's mostly crap actually.
You will basically not be affected at all.  Where today there is one bitcoin, one blockchain, tomorrow there will be two - with a shared history up to 12.20pm UTC, but diverging thereafter.
This means:
- if you hold private keys to the current blockchain (which you do), you will own coins on both the new blockchains
- we should expect that the total value of bitcoin will not change at the moment of forking.  This means that, if BCC has any significant value, there will be a commensurate reduction in value of BTC.  
Many people will want to dump one or other coin, but if you're a hodler just hodl and watch.  It might be complicated to actually do anything in terms of selling one or other coin immediately.  In due course there will likely be easy ways to sell (or buy) coins on each chain, if that's what you want to do.
That help?

Your saying the price of bitcoin depends on the cost of mining.  Just look at what that means.  Suppose tomorrow Obama announces US is abandoning dollar and adopting bitcoin.  But at the same time there is, coincidentally, a massive drop in the cost of electricity and mining bitcoins becomes cheaper.  You're saying we'd see the price go down?
Edit:  and all these crazy bitcoin dreamers (incl me) are actually dreaming that the price of electricity might go to the moon?

But what if you find that on your own you cannot defend yourself against people who are stronger.  What if you find that it is economically much more efficient to group together for self defence. (Which it obviously is).  And then how do you make the decisions about how that defence is organised and administered?
I think the reason I don't have to worry about violence in my life is precisely because we have organised, group self defence.

Like all market prices transaction fees are determined by supply (blockspace) and demand (for making txs).  
Miner costs are entirely secondary to this and inevitably adjust to equal expected revenues (fees + block reward).
@_date: 2018-12-17 22:33:11
Personally I think transaction scaling is of secondary importance to immutability of supply and censorship resistance.  If transaction scaling is of primary importance to you, you might want to look at other cryptocurrencies.   Or paypal.

I'd say the most reasonable and meaningful definition of "deflation" is a decrease in the money supply *relative to output*.  If output grows, as it usually does in the end, fixed money supply is deflationary, obviously.  So in the med/long run it is exactly the same as "prices go down".  In fact I take inflation/deflation to relate to prices, not money supply.
I haven't watched your links but I would take "a small constant rate of inflation" to mean expansion at a slightly greater rate than output.  Which means rising prices.

It really matters if it's true.  You have the network costs and bloat of full-size blocks, for the transaction throughput of  much smaller blocks.  And as long as miners can choose transactions, it's hard to see how this would stop.  An over-bloated blockchain is not something you can "correct".
Thing is, you wouldn't expect it to be possible without collusion - an individual miner would be irrational to stuff a block with their own transactions and forego real ones with fees.  So if it's happening it's quite worrying as it probably means a substantial majority of hashpower is being controlled by a single entity.
Also it is an extremely strong argument against big blocks - as it implies that, whatever size permitted, they will be stuffed by miners until the same number of real transactions are included as we have now.

It's a new asset going from zero to equilibrium value.  That obviously means volatility, but in the long term it will settle down.  Every year it gets less volatile and it's comparable to many stocks and currencies now, I'd say.  Also you ask why people would trade with it - well traders like volatility.

No other coin has the security of bitcoin.  Nothing has been tested by fire the way bitcoin has, and none but ethereum has anything like the dev expertise (while ethereum also has a much bigger attack surface).  But if they get big / stay big, they will be attacked, and then we'll find out what they are made of.  With bitcoin we know already.

Seriously, you cannot really make money from investing in bitcoin (if that's what you are hoping for) unless you understand it and believe in it.  
If you don't believe in it, any investment you make is random punt and you will rationally sell as soon as you make any sort of return, or if its value crashes.
If you want to find out about it and decide for yourself if it is a good investment, you can start here:  
If you do, there are two golden rules:
* do not keep bitcoin on exchanges - you do not own it unless you have it on a wallet you control
* when using your own wallet, make sure to protect your seed words

The problem is that the bigger the blockchain, the fewer people can run nodes, and the easier it will be when Govts or special interests try to control it, as they certainly will.
Bitcoin has only 1 thing that makes it different from existing systems:  decentralization, and the ability to resist control by vested interests.  It must be the priority, and bigger blocks threaten it (or certainly will at one point).
Bear in mind also:  vested interests will want to push for bigger blocks so they can have more control (Jihan Wu does this);  once the blockchain is bloated there is no way back.

It shouldn't look like that, even if the transaction hasn't yet confirmed.  You should still be able to see the details of it.  Maybe restart the app.

While it's great if you and / or your mom learn to understand the bitcoin code, it's important to note that might not necessarily be required for the open source 'trust model' to work - i.e. for you to have confidence in the code.  
That's because, in principle, all it needs is a single competent and honest individual to have reviewed it - because if they had, and it had some hidden trap, they would have found it and publicised it.
In practice, while I can't competently review the code myself, I'm personally satisfied that there are many hundreds of competent coders who have - and that if there was a problem I would know about it.
This is like any other open source project.  Everyone doesn't have to review all the code, but the fact that the code exists for anyone to look at means it is very unlikely it contains anything malicious.
Also, +1 for [Mastering Bitcoin]( if you want to get a handle on how this all works.
@_date: 2017-06-20 20:31:36
Great.  Look after them - that's very important, for every wallet you every make.  
One possible solution to your current issue might be to use the seed to restore your wallet - eg delete the app, reinstall and then restore.  If you're certain you have the seed correct.  
Might want to see if copay do support, or google to see if others have had your issue. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 22:04:49

I'm guessing you don't run a node?  The storage isn't the issue, it's the management of it.  Eg when I first set up a node it took maybe a week to download the blockchain.  Now it would likely take a month or two.  And (I'm no expert here) I gather the processing of traffic / new blocks puts some disproportionate burden on memory or something, so that if blocks get much bigger, the hardware requirements get much greater.

It's not clear to me why this must be the case.  LN is a cambrian explosion of new ways to interact economically with real bitcoin, especially in the way channels are created and re-used.  Eg if interested look at channel factories and splicing, which are all ways of multiplying up the channel creation possibilities per on-chain transaction.  I think it can just as much be argued that there will be a (far future) problem of insufficient on chain transactions, because we will get so good at reusing payment channels.

Personally I think this will be driven by investors.  A UASF coin would be extremely attractive, and the cheaper the better - and price will bring mining.  But to bootstrap this, and signal the value of mining this chain, there needs to be a proper market.  At 1 block/day would that be possible?   If this line of reasoning is correct some sort of off-chain instrument would be really useful.
Ah but what about fees!!!  If there's just 1 block per day, and everyone wants to buy UASF coins, they will pay the value directly to miners in fees!  Eg if mkt price is $1, but people value UASFcoin at $10, they will pay $9 to get into the block.  So miners get the reward and incentive already (paid in UASFcoins!).

The problem is, there's no trial we can do here.  If blocksize increases too much and we get a bloated blockchain that can't be properly decentralized, then that's it, it's all over.  No going back.
Bitcoin is nothing without decentralization.  At some level of blocksize decentralization will certainly unwind and bitcoin will die.  The only question is, at what level of blocksize that would happen.  That's an extremely difficult and complex question.  I certainly don't know the answer, and I doubt EGS does.  But we must surely proceed with maximum caution.  And "accepting a compromise" on that is just wrong.

I don't see how anyone could genuinely endorse it, as it seems completely undefined.  It's a total nonsense!  Roger Ver came straight out after it was published saying he didn't even sign it.  It's unclear whether HF comes first or segwit, or either or neither.  Etc etc
Also, while I'm at it, wtf is the point in re-engineering segwit to a ridiculous timetable when it's already there, done and tested.
Maybe it's been poorly reported or something, or we don't know the whole picture (NB, this is obvoiusly problematic itself) as there were some people supposedly signing who I thought I respected, but the whole thing seems like an utter farce to me.

Go and have a look!?  Or if you gave shares to other people, ask them to look.  They are presumably trusted to some degree - and it's not obvious what reason anyone would have to lie about that.

OK well hopefully should be resolved then.  Remember also, if the worst comes to worst you can restore your seed on a different wallet.

Don't erase anything.
Your backup seed for the ledger is all you need for any bitcoins sent to that wallet.  Make sure you keep your seed totally safe.

OP this is terrible advice.  All these markets are totally manipulated, and you only make money from them if it's you who's doing the manipulation.  Otherwise you lose.
Understand the tech, see if you can get expertise you can use.  If you're looking to invest, then do your research and make your own mind up, and hodl - don't trade.
@_date: 2017-06-18 21:07:36
Wouldn't that bring forward difficulty retargeting on the 148 chain, and make it more likely that it at least exists (albeit with a lot of lost txs) possibly in time for segwit activation?  Also wouldn't it increase the likelihood that the legacy chain would be reorged?
@_date: 2017-06-20 17:18:02
Why is it better than segwit.  For anyone.

In future storage might get a bit easier - though never as easy as a current bank account, for example.  The point of bitcoin is that you take responsibility for it yourself and there are ultimately no shortcuts.
Fees are sure to get much higher if bitcoin is successful.   
If ease of storage and low apparent fees are important you should maybe check out the many shitcoin alternatives or, better still, consider a fiat money.

Series of 12 or 24 words.  They act as a backup for all the bitcoin you have in your wallet - and you can use them to restore your wallet (using many different apps) if you lose your phone or whatever.  
If you go to settings, then select your wallet (under "Wallets and Integrations" on my phone), there is a "Backup" option.
Definitely worth doing that now.

Sounds kind of dangerous to me.  The phrase will not be random, and it's hard to know how much entropy you lose.  Storing seeds in your brain alone is risky - what if you get hit on the head?  Even knowing them at all is arguably risky, as it leaves you more vulnerable to the [$5 wrench attack](

It is indisputable that bigger blocks increase centralization.  The only question is about the size of blocks at which it becomes a problem.
It's important because without decentralization, bitcoin is basically a very inefficient kind of paypal.

Satoshi disappeared, and bitcoin was fine, didn't need him.  He wasn't important.  But you seemed to be implying it was important that ethereum had Vitalik.  Or are you actually saying that it would be no different if he disappeared?
