Manias are hilarious. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 19:23:34
Yeah for my next pump and dump. All you fools load up the coffers. I want to sell.
@_date: 2018-08-08 23:12:51
I do this with shares of Netscape and metacrawler. I have billions of shares now! They are due to rocket anytime soon.

What is the term for buying the dips on the way down? Bitcoining it?
@_date: 2018-08-08 23:15:33
The wife of the psycho who keeps wasting money on a Ponzi scheme.

That dude looks like a giant from historic art
@_date: 2019-03-07 18:06:22
The housing market didn’t crash! Speculators in real estate are scaring people with falling house prices into selling to buy everything up at the new lows!
@_date: 2019-03-26 02:43:35
Oh really? Gee, better go buy 800 million dollars worth... thanks.
@_date: 2019-03-06 05:07:01
Super pump and dump. Gonna wring our the hodlers. Dude is worth over 5 billion. If it was gonna skyrocket without his purchases he would be dumping in millions
@_date: 2019-03-07 06:32:26
Buy up, fools. Pump and dump isn’t done until the hodlers quit.
@_date: 2019-03-06 05:11:04
Next bubble? Bitcoin is a sunken cost investment for the victims of the pump and dump. It only has value because hodlers are scared to take their losses yet.
@_date: 2019-03-07 18:09:35
Yeah my stocks in .com shit from the 90s is ready for bull run season too 
@_date: 2019-03-06 05:07:44
Over 5 billion
@_date: 2019-03-07 18:07:57
Never sell .com stocks
@_date: 2019-03-06 05:09:33
You aren’t a believer in a money, you are a speculator who has hope.
@_date: 2019-11-22 00:59:43
Ok penny stocks pump and dump pusher.....
@_date: 2019-11-27 14:31:23
He started out a billionaire, became a millionaire.
@_date: 2019-11-22 00:58:29
Buy the dip just means get in on the next pump and dump
@_date: 2018-06-08 06:06:11
You wish.
@_date: 2018-06-28 00:24:34
Imagine bitcoin is a .com stock in the late 90s. It has value because no one makes profit from it and if enough people buy and hold it will gain value for that reason? If you tell someone “hold!” You are telling a bunch of other suckers “don’t run on the bank! We will find out they don’t have it!”

Shoe shine boy

Gold is an investment from 6000 years ago. Trying $50 worth 4000 years ago
@_date: 2019-04-10 03:36:01
Right on!!!! Dump every penny you have into bitcoin right now!!!
I need to cash out, i'm in the hole for 1000's.
@_date: 2019-06-05 01:35:04
You're not just looking for things to justify your investments, right?
@_date: 2019-12-28 20:34:24
No you werent.
@_date: 2019-04-03 05:04:00
Bro, it's going to 22.5 billion dollars!!! you just needed to hodl!!
@_date: 2019-04-04 08:20:28
Translation: hey everyone, I bought in during the bubble and need to sell, bitcoin is cool and awesome and totally going to 75,000. Please look at this radical crazy price increase all the way up to 5000! It's definitely not 10,000 plus below the record high. It's just an uptick in the uptick of all upticks coming!
@_date: 2019-04-09 03:25:41
Start of bull market based on what?
@_date: 2019-04-09 03:27:36
If this was a bull run mad wall st money would be coming in to sucker a bunch more people while at least some of the hodlers could eat their losses and get out.
@_date: 2018-11-28 04:02:31
i.e. Misery loves company.
@_date: 2018-11-28 16:49:58
If this excites you take it as a sign that your expectations are way too low.
@_date: 2018-11-27 06:57:25
So you can sell?
@_date: 2018-11-28 04:09:00
This is antivaccine mom's getting calls from doctors who "saw the light" or feminist pig trolls who get claps in lines for calling out bro-dudes.
@_date: 2018-11-27 01:34:48
Dream much?
@_date: 2018-11-28 04:04:06
What is this shit? Why are so many of you so arrogant as you lose all your wealth? Wisdom? Buyin a dip before the bottom settles? Retarded wishful thinking. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 21:32:41
You wish. Where is the VCR in there?
@_date: 2019-01-02 01:06:56
Apple is a company with a product.... the hell are you smoking?
@_date: 2018-03-23 04:43:11
If everyone just goes and buys all these underwater mortgages, the market won’t collapse all the way!!
@_date: 2019-01-05 05:00:14
You were just basically transferring money to the pump and dumpers.
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:37:11
Uh huh. Buy up. Has anyone introduced you to penny stocks?
@_date: 2019-01-01 22:00:43
Misery loves company. Someone needs to be hodling the bag at the end. Thanks for volunteering.
@_date: 2018-11-28 04:01:49
lmao. This is a bucket of r/thathappened bias confirmation horse shit.
@_date: 2019-01-16 19:33:55
What percentage of year 1 people are here?
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:37:08
Everyone who took profits 2 months ago is posting these. Yeah, keep holding. Don’t get out of a sinking ship until it’s in the bottom of the ocean.
@_date: 2019-01-01 22:37:42
Keep going down with the ship. That’s really intelligent. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:35:44
“I’m holding and my pride is a little fragile.”
@_date: 2019-01-01 22:06:51
That’s not the alternative. Ever heard of assets? Bitcoin got pumped and dumped by wall st. That’s it. It’s over. The value is only in the novelty and it’s worn off.
@_date: 2018-03-18 19:05:28
100,000 shoe shine boys.
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:47:05
Every single bitcoin buyer should study manias and bubbles. There is nothing to a rapid price increase but psychology. 100% psychology. No innovation is nearly as strong as a big buyer driving a market higher to suck in all the get-rich-quick people and then wipe them out. It's centuries old already....
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:39:56
Yeah I didn’t take enough profits last time! Let’s reinflate!
@_date: 2018-11-27 16:45:19
Lol. Uh huh, before the bottom levels out... right.
@_date: 2018-07-21 21:52:47
Horrific install. 
@_date: 2018-07-22 17:40:59
Says a bitcoin dupe.

Solar requires the grid. Genius. You use electricity at night?
@_date: 2018-07-21 23:02:13
I'm an installer and a project manager in Hawaii for 6+ years. You dont know a God damned thing, kid.
@_date: 2018-07-29 09:01:20
@_date: 2018-07-21 23:06:06
You flash every hole, dummy. The only way it's getting into the roof is if the installer is a moron.
@_date: 2019-09-26 22:52:36
This doesn't show the actual highs
@_date: 2018-07-21 21:53:42
It doesn't hurt the production, it just looks horrible
@_date: 2018-07-22 01:42:11
You dont need the grid, but 99.9% of solar is grid tied, dipshit.

Greece? Or are we going to have a no true scotsman argument?
@_date: 2016-07-08 07:00:42
I'm not reading this stupid no scotsman horse shit. If you adopt socialist policies and infect your markets with massive intervention and mandates, you are socialist. You can't be a little bit pregnant.
@_date: 2016-07-08 01:03:21
Do they interfere in the markets and have a massive welfare state?
@_date: 2018-12-16 00:51:35
Lol. All these profit takers sure are dumb! They don’t want to ride to 0 with the rest of us smart poor first time investors in anything.
@_date: 2016-07-07 03:08:51
Then it's not capitalism, although bail ins and negative interest rates actually exist in socialist democracies.
@_date: 2018-12-16 00:52:29
You don’t have gold giving people shells. You have air and are trading for a petrol dollar. You’re the sucker.....
@_date: 2016-07-08 01:03:39
By government indebting a bunch of 45 year old retirees? lol....
@_date: 2018-12-16 00:53:29
No they will never buy back. Be realistic. Sunken costs suck but they, like a fatal illness, are best handled before they become insurmountable
