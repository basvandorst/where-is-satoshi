You people need to learn to trade in UTC. UTC is the standard timing for all professional traders.
Day candles, for example, open and close on UTC Days generally.

Read my earlier reply on this thread about $15k BTC still very much possible (see June). It's not FUD, it's context.

We’re still very due for it, because the day still closed around $11.4k. My guess is we run up some more, the pullback will probably only last a few days, but it should be a big pullback. I would say we pullback sometime between now and mid-January, we will see I suppose. I’m still trading it in the meantime.

Sure thing. RSI (the indicator that is circled, RSI is short for Relative Strength Index) is used by most traders to know when something is overbought or oversold. When things cross out of the purple area on the top side they are considered overbought. The chart shows that, when you look at this on a daily basis, BTC has a several month history of having a brief price correction when the RSI is at a similar level to today and the past few days.

This isn't a doomsday graph. Just means people should make sure they know know at which points in cycles they are investing in. RSI could easily run up to June level (94), that's basically $15k+

Notice in the second link how on the hourly grain it consistently hits resistance at that level and then rises back up. It’s a reversal pattern.

I'm not giving an indication of where the price will move, I'm giving indications of what price points to look at to determine what the price movements will be when/if they occur.

Using price channel lines at the past reversal points. And, we don't know it's the real floor, it just looks like one right now.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:47:15
Naw, notice how this channel may now become a ceiling instead of a floor.
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:33:21
Per my other comments, note that I state that if the price falls below the floor for an extended period of time the floor is likely to become a ceiling and a new floor will form. Note, however, how key this floor is in the second link. That bouncing behavior at the same price level isn't by happenstance.
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:15:10
Right now I think it will stay in the dark green price channel and go up. But, if it dips below the bottom price channel for more than 1-3 hours I would expect the price floor to now become the price ceiling, meaning it could fall to it's next floor support level of ~4900.

Great point. Agreed on big money completely.

OKEX. It's not a trading floor per say, but it is an exchange where you can enter into short positions.

7800 total bitcoin, margin called at 6100.

@_date: 2017-10-30 20:03:28
Important to note that this price movement was the result of a $48M margin call on a BTC short position on OKEX. That makes it a bit of an unnatural price movement - one that price/volume history wouldn't have really predicted.

You’re close. Let me explain:
When you short you are betting price will go down. To to this you “borrow” shares you don’t own and sell them right now. Then, you wait for the price to go down and you then buy at the lower price, give your borrowed shares back and take the profit.
To exit a short position you have to buy shares, to exit a long position you have to sell shares. In this case the price went too high for this person to cover their position, so they have to return all of their “borrowed” bitcoin. They don’t have any BTC to return, so they have to buy BTC at the current market price, tons of it. 7,100 bitcoins to be exact.
Basically: it introduces a massive market buy order to the market. Remember that market orders remove limit orders and this price increases. So a sudden large market buy can eat up a lot of the Sell side of an order book, causing the buyer to keep buying shares at higher and higher prices until their order quantity has been filled at the market price.
So, this massive market order happens all at once, the market doesn’t have time to fill the limit order book, price shoots up.

I don’t know of an aggregator, it took me hours of searching to even find out that this was the cause. OKEX keeps a public book of its outstanding short contracts
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:32:29
It’s just a standard margin short position, same as the stock market in every way. You borrow shares and sell them at the current market price and plan on the price falling, you then purchase shares at a lower price and return them to the person who lent them to you. Your return is the spread between the prices.

Well, technically by adding $48M to a finite number of BTC units the value of BTC really did go up, realistically, by that much. BTC value is nothing other than supply and demand being matched at a certain price.
For market vs limit orders I recommend some googling/investipedia-ing. They'll explain it even better than me, and with visuals.

People trading with big amounts absolutely talk to each other.
@_date: 2017-10-31 06:12:40
Yes, but also no. The degree of price movement can equally be a function of a pretty empty Sell limit order book. Considering the number of people "trading" BTC without really knowing what is happening it's pretty easy to assume that BTC isn't going to act quite the sophisticated way that it should. $48M on a sparse order book can be nuts. That size of a market buy on GDAX right now would literally eat the entire book.
