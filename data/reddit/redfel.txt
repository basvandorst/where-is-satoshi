So how come Canadian dollars were never sent either? Why did Mtgox blame a "two week bank backlog" for their troubles?
The $5 million seized from Mtgox's coffers is a pittance compared to the 250,000 or so Bitcoins they've collected in usurious fees over the years.

This whole "the government has the coins" theory doesn't hold water. If they did, they would have transferred the coins to a government wallet. It would be ridiculous for them to assume that Karpeles only had the private key printed out once.

A highly disproportionate number of Bitcoiners are white, Jewish, or Asian. I'd say 95%+.


Even if the board was "representative", it would still be controlled by a small collection of people that you have no influence over. Same with most things in life. I think you just like complaining and your feelings of inferiority cause you to identify with allegedly marginalized groups. That, and you're also a queer. 


@_date: 2014-04-05 03:38:44

Why is the price falling? I d-d-d-don't understand! Muh moon.
@_date: 2014-05-12 18:34:53
This "representation" thing is another piece of evidence as to why diversity is not only far from a strength, but a huge weakness. Minority groups, it is alleged, will not buy Product X or watch Movie Y unless their race is represented somehow in the marketing.

Yeah, Bitcoin is great. Now to exchange the $5 worth of Bitcoin he has to sign up for an exchange, give proof of identity,  DNA sample, and pay .5% just tlo trade. Then, you have to transfer it to your bank which costs $10 minimum and the bank also charges money for Incoming wire.

Bitcoin is a completely irrational market where manipulation rules the day. There's no logic whatsoever to any of the movements.
@_date: 2013-11-18 03:44:00
Why do you think the value of Bitcoin has quintupled in about a month's time, particularly after losing its biggest customer, and while the U.S. government could crash Mtgox to $70 with one click?
@_date: 2013-12-04 07:26:58


Remember when Reddit started accepting Bitcoin and they [spent more money on accountants than the revenue Bitcoin brought in]( 


Everyone here is looking to get rich, but they don't admit that the motive for signing up new companies to accept Bitcoin is not so that they can spend their bitcoin but so that their hoard grows more valuable. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 19:11:26
I agree with this. Everyone wants a Bitcoin, but no one wants to spend a Bitcoin. And why should they? Paypal is even easier and I don't have to worry that the $5 I spent could be worth $1000 in 5 years.

Don't feel bad, this looked a lot like The Crash to me. I've lost almost 20 Bitcoins this month, but I made back about 4 with this latest crash. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:04:50
Even though this latest bubble has been completely meritless, if someone bought above $650 and sold at, say, $1000, that would be a really decent return on investment. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 04:34:58

@_date: 2013-12-03 21:16:08
If those 7000 transactions amounted to only, say, $100,000, it's all irrelevant when a few hundred transitions for miners generated millions of income for Bitpay in one month.

Why? Other than speculation?
@_date: 2013-11-13 01:07:54
You idiots were saying the exact same thing the last bubble. The value of bitcoin has quadrupled in the past month for no apparent reason after losing its biggest customer. it's absurd that this is not a bubble.
And btw, the US government could crash the price to $50 tomorrow with their Silk Road stash.
@_date: 2013-07-05 23:40:21

This will only drive the price up. If people can't withdraw fiat, the exchange is basically a ponzi scheme. Mtgox tried this and it led to the last bubble.

Haha, even though on the first Senate hearing on Monday, the price went from $650 to $900 within hours? You cult members are deluded.

@_date: 2013-12-07 06:16:43
Why is this the official bubble burst  but not the last three times these past two months it has lost over 30% of its value in a day?
@_date: 2013-08-06 02:03:03
Who dropped the ball on this and how? I remember it was posted beforehand at one of those Bitcoin news sites as a rumor and then it was confirmed by WSJ.
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:54:23
If inflation doesn't create jobs, why are economists so worried when the currency begins deflating as it did in 2009?
@_date: 2013-11-06 06:32:00
I don't think so. The Silk Road shutdown should have brought it down to $60 or less. There is nothing driving this bubble other than Mtgox's insolvency artificially inflating the price and new Chinese suckers getting on board. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 21:25:44
It was a bubble though. And its a bubble again. 2.5x increase in value in just one month for virtually no reason?
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:47:48
I've been saying this for awhile. Bitcoin cultists are too deluded by visions of opulent palaces to see this bubble has no clothes.
@_date: 2013-11-18 07:17:47
Because people still consider Mtgox the official price, even though Goxbux are virtually worthless.
Remember, much of this current bubble is the result of Mtgox's insolvency. When Mtgox announced that withdrawals would take "two more weeks®", the price plummeted to $66 due to lack of faith. Then, the price gradually went up and up because there was reduced selling pressure.

Speculation and newcomers based on Silk Road publicity. Baidu subsidiary accepting Bitcoin also probably brought in the Chinese even more so. 
@_date: 2013-10-22 03:15:07
The March Fincen guidance was partly responsible for the last bubble, along with the baseless speculation about Cyprus. There doesn't seem to be anything driving this bubble. 
@_date: 2013-08-05 02:32:22
How is this legal though?
@_date: 2013-10-04 01:34:57
Oh so the Silk Road going down in April 2013 was why the price stopped at $160. I was wondering what happened.

How do you get money into BTC-E using a bank?
@_date: 2013-11-22 02:10:37


Oh, so how do I get starving kids in Africa some Bitcoin? If they're starving, do they have computers? How will they exchange it for, you  know, actual money?
I know everyone on this forum wants to get rich off Bitcoin, but do you really want to live in a world where Bitcoin has replaced traditional currencies, where people simply hoard instead of investing?
@_date: 2013-11-10 06:19:10
60 - 120. It's irrelevant because all my money is profit. My ire is based on my almost suicidal self-hatred for myself. Every damn time I sell, the price goes back up and I end up taking a haircut on Bitcoins. I am a piece of shit. Lots of hard work actually went into getting some of those Bitcoins through arbitrage. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:47:40
Why would you use Mtgox? The site is a pyramid scheme. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 03:01:07
Sure, they just realized it all in the past month. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 04:01:32
Yes. But their plan all along was to manipulate the market into another bubble. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 03:41:36
It probably wouldn't be worth the trouble for them to accept Bitcoin. But if Newegg started accepting Bitcoin, the price would undoubtedly increase, which is what everyone here is looking for, but won't admit. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 04:10:19
You know, usually when the price of a stock goes up, there's some sort of reason behind it. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:15:28
Bitpay still hasn't surpassed their sales total in March when Bitcoin had a much smaller market cap.
@_date: 2013-11-22 14:43:25
And why? Last night, the Btcchina price dropping below $5000 caused it to fall under $700. Now, the BTChina price is still under $5000 yet there's an all time high. What idiot is pumping up the price?
@_date: 2013-12-03 02:08:05
Of course they would have. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 14:46:05
Bitcoin doesn't solve any of those problems, and is actually quite likely to increase corruption and poverty. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 02:44:37
And that was really dumb of you considering what the price is now. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:44:11
So you borrowed money to buy coins at the peak?
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:16:39
Gox is incompetent because you people allow them to be. How many threads have we had where the Mtgox price was considered the official price? Why did I [get downvoted]( for calling out Mtgox for the pyramid scheme it is?

@_date: 2013-11-06 02:44:04
What fundamentals? The price is only going up because people think the price is going up. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 15:05:28

@_date: 2013-11-10 05:03:42
That didn't cause the crash. Mtgox's lag did, mostly.

China is not mentioned in either of those documents. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 05:58:44


These aren't marginal fees. The bank charges you money to send a wire transfer to these exchanges. Want to buy $10 worth of Bitcoin? Forget about it.


I don't think so. Inflation is pretty low and people in other countries actually want USD because of its stability. 
@_date: 2013-12-15 08:18:49
It's really not worth your time. No one is really spending Bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 04:27:37
Not shorting, selling low and buying high. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 05:44:12
Great article and quite true. It doesn't even mention the effects of a deflationary spiral if Bitcoin ever became officially in use by a country. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:10:15
Bitcoin may not be an MLM but its supporters sure act like it is.
@_date: 2013-11-10 05:07:54
That is true, but I am struggling to comprehend why people aren't panic selling the way they should be right now. Why is the price still so high? It's insane and it needs to crash, now. 
@_date: 2013-05-02 04:28:36
Is Bitcoin winning? Is this an official poll?
@_date: 2013-12-11 02:38:02


No, no, they haven't. People are almost universally only interested in Bitcoin as a way to get rich. Actual transactions using Bitcoin are still laughably small. Bitcoin has a $10 billion dollar market cap and the best the Bitcoin community could muster on Black Friday was about 10,000 transactions. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:20:15
We do not know what the day holds. A guy is planning to cash out of 20k BTC today. The government holds enough BTC to crash the price down to $100 on Mtgox. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 03:55:33
Quiet you. I will sell my Bitcoins for what the market will pay, but what people are willing to pay is insane and irrational. 
@_date: 2013-10-20 04:43:28
If Berkshire Hathaway shares can hit $175,000, imagine the price for Bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-11-22 02:17:10
Plausible, but I haven't seen any evidence for it. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 04:43:15
Yeah, good idea to lose a lot of money. The price has already crashed 25% in one day. Catching a falling knife. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 03:37:18
Spoken like a true cult member
@_date: 2013-11-06 06:17:47
I would be fine if we saw the price grow organically, but unfortunately,  this is another bubble and I wish ever so much for it to collapse like the last time. 
@_date: 2013-12-22 02:58:21
I think Bitcoin is dumb as shit, but I've made decent money off it. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:45:58
All of those criticisms are fair.
 Bitcoin is a currency that is rarely used as a currency. Why the hell would anyone spend a Bitcoin if they could be worth much more in the future? A deflationary currency only encourages hoarding. 
@_date: 2013-10-20 23:35:20
It looks like they did actually:
Amazing. I sold my 60gh/s unit for just over 80 BTC less than 3 months ago. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 08:07:43
Yeah, this was the same site saying to "hold" during the last crash. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:12:05
We are in "about to collapse" territory here.
@_date: 2013-12-22 01:33:21
Isn't Bitcoin great?
@_date: 2013-12-17 04:02:41
As opposed to the non-paid shills who promote Bitcoin at every opportunity to drive up the price?
@_date: 2013-11-15 01:58:17
People are buying because the price is going up. There are no fundamentals behind it, it's entirely speculative. 
@_date: 2013-04-01 03:22:57
I have noticed that the price often increases during the night, possibly because of Russian/Euro action. Is tomorrow a Russian/Euro bank holiday?
@_date: 2013-12-03 02:09:29
What makes you think they hold 62% of them?
@_date: 2013-11-18 03:35:14
Let's hope so. The true value should be about $60 in all honesty.
@_date: 2013-11-21 03:06:19
What's wrong with these criticisms? Bitcoin as a currency is terrible. Bitcoin as a speculative investment is great, as long as more suckers can be brought into the fold. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 06:54:05
Trust me, I watch this place like a hawk. Baidu's subsidiary has received less than $500 worth of Bitcoins. Those European food delivery services just poppped up a day or two ago and I doubt they've received many Bitcoins.
 Just becasue the Chinese are buying lots of Bitcoins doesn't mean that this bubble has had a foundation. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 02:42:53


Right, third world people all have first world luxuries like data plans. 


Not really. What was the last bitcoin business to spring up that really made a dent (besides the hated CoinValidation)?


Great, and if everyone did that, Bitcoin would die. 


An economy where people invest their money is much superior to an economy where people just hoard their money.

@_date: 2013-11-22 14:40:28
The answer is that almost everyone here is pretty much just looking to get rich. 
The fact is, Bitcoin is a currency that almost nobody actually uses as a currency. And why would they? Who wants to spend something that could be worth much more in the future? Further, Bitcoin is just cumbersome. It is far easier for me to pay for something with Paypal, and with Paypal, I have buyer protection.

@_date: 2013-11-27 21:23:28
Bitcoins value is entirely speculative. Seriously, it's gone up 10x in two months for absolutely no reason when it should have gone down to $50 after losing far and away its biggest use, The Silk Road. Bitcoins only killer app is buying illegal things.

@_date: 2013-11-10 19:16:20
LOL, you see the price lose 25% of its value in one day and you think there's still big money to be made from this bubble.

The big question is, who are these idiots throwing themselves against this falling knife? Who in their right mind buys a thousand coins at 550 when the price just collapsed to 511 and keeps going down? Must be a malfunctioning bot or something. 
And why is Bitstamp, which has generally maintained a $100 spread over the past day, not gone down a bit?
@_date: 2013-11-20 03:19:20
They accept U.S. deposits? But is the order book in Canadian?
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:23:08
That sounds like an utterly retarded idea. If you're so sure the price will be 4 times in a few months, why are people selling right now?
@_date: 2013-12-22 02:40:56
Why are you defending this company? They claimed that their "backlog" issue was because the banks would could only process so many transactions per day (even though they were fine before), but in reality, the truth was that they were bankrupt. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 19:17:34
This is true.
@_date: 2013-11-28 02:08:29
People are only willing to pay the Gox prices because Mtgox has historically been the official price. And as we can see by this very thread, the drooling retards at Reddit continue to believe it's the official price. This entire bubble has been largely fed my Mtgox's insolvency. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:21:19
My guess? Insider trading from the U.S. government plus the Silk Road related publicity. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 20:51:13

Something other than pure speculation. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 05:16:53
Look, I believe in Bitcoin's long term value, but I hate this latest bubble and I'm genuinely shocked the price hasn't crashed today, after a 25% drop. I'm just interested in making more coins and unfortunately I just sold seemingly at the bottom. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 07:13:35
Oh boy, more lunatic rantings from Bitcoin cultists.

Also, how can Venmo not know where the money came from?
@_date: 2013-12-26 06:07:53
I think he's right. Mtgox was obviously bankrupt, and I cannot, for the life of me, understand why the government of Japan did not shut them down.
Bitcoin is all about the Greater Fool theory. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 02:30:31
Bitcoin may not be a Ponzi scheme, but its supporters sure act like it is one.
And the historically largest exchange has not sent out international wire transfers for months, creating huge buying pressure where there would have been none before. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 06:42:31
If there was some sort of development, big sites accepting Bitcoin, more Fincen guidance, the perception of a country like Cyrpus investing in Bitcoins, I could understand the bubble, but this one has been founded on nothing. Bitcoin just lost its most important customer in the Silk Road and the government now has 1% of all Bitcoins which they could use to crash the market. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 05:53:37

I am genuinely surprised. I thought the price was going down to $60 and then it rebounded. I essentially lost $3000 yesterday by not buying at around $90! FML.

Bitcoin really is a cult at times. The value has increased 4 times in just a single month based on *absolutely nothing* but pure speculation, but apparently it's not a bubble, oh no sir. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:42:51

The value has gone up 4 times in just one month, based on absolutely nothing but pure speculation. We just had a crash of 25% in ONE DAY, and yet faith remains? Why the fuck haven't we completely crashed like the last time? Where are the Bitcoin whales to crash this idiotic party like last time? We should absolutely be crashing right now, and I've very confused as to why we're not. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:11:29

Hurr, that's what they were saying before the last crash too. 4 times increase in value in one month based on absolutely nothing, but no, it's not a bubble.

I gambled away 35 bitcoins this week thinking the price was crashing. All of my stash is pure profit but I want to kill myself. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 07:27:27
Evidence it's a bubble:
-The price has more than quadrupled in a month for no reason. Even the last bubble had more legitimate sites accepting Bitcoin, the strong demand for mining machines, the perception that Cypriots were somehow stashing their money in Bitcoin. The only explanation for this current bubble is... the Chinese are buying for some reason. 
-Bitcoin just lost far and away its biggest customer, the Silk Road. 
-People were saying the exact same "it's not a bubble" nonsense the last time.

You can choose what to do with them after you receive them, but whilst they are still in our hands they will go to the address the order was originally intended for.

The much hated U.S. dollar is one of the most stable currencies in the world. Inflation is actually a good thing because it encourages people to invest. We have already seen with Bitcoin that a deflationary currency is bad because no one wants to actually spend the damn things. 
Bitcoin really is like a ponzi scheme because Bitcoin cultists are always trying to get new businesses to accept Bitcoin and when they do, no one uses Bitcoin.
Just look at Baidu's webhosting business, their acceptance of Bitcoin caused a spike in the price but less than 1.5 Bitcoins have flowed into their service: 
@_date: 2013-11-26 04:08:06
Companies would cut costs by firing most of their workforce. You wouldn't have to worry about "working more", you'd have to worry about working, period.

Once again, we see that the Bitcoin market is completely irrational. The spread between Bitstamp and Mtgox was almost $150 two day ago. From this I conclude either that people using Bitstamp are genuinely retarded or there is massive manipulation going on.

@_date: 2013-12-03 17:24:13
Sorry, but this subreddit has 76,000 readers yet less than 7,000 transactions went through Bitpay on Bitcoin Black Friday. The truth is, everyone wants a bitcoin but no one wants to spend one. Why would you spend something that you believe could be way more valuable in the future? 
@_date: 2013-11-10 20:13:09
Complete irrationality. Usually, the Mtgox price is lower than the Chinese price, yet these have been reversed at times today. We're going down. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 03:34:32
20% increase in one day? Totally not a bubble, just organic growth!

Based on what? Mindless speculation.


This is not true, there were only some hearings, and these hearings went on when the price was around $650.


The media has only taken an interest in Bitcoin again because of this insane speculative bubble.


The price went down over 50% just last week!


I'm not saying it is doomed, I am saying that we are in an insane bubble right now driven by absolutely nothing but speculation.

@_date: 2013-11-29 08:11:36
New paradigm, right folks?
Don't kid yourself, this is a massive bubble being driven by absolutely nothing but hype. At least the last bubble was driven by things like biggish sites accepting Bitcoin, and the perception that Cypriots were somehow putting money into Bitcoin, despite funds being frozen. 
This bubble is based on nothing. When the Silk Road shut down, the price should have gone to $50. 
I am tired of these threads from self-interested cultists trying to justify the insane valuation. Just admit you're interested in Bitcoin so you can get rich. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 04:56:41

They received less than 1.5 bitcoins. Clearly this latest bubble was idiotic.

You cannot withdraw money from Mtgox unless you have a Japanese bank or European account. And Mtgox sends out less than $30,000 a day to European accounts despite literally millions flowing into Mtgox each day.

Let us not forget that much of the price rise can be attributed to Mtgox's insolvency. People can't get their money out of Mtgox, causing there to be less selling pressure. The price went down to $66 before people realized it's dumb to sell on Mtgox.
