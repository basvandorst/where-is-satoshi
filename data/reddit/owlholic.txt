Exactly. With 30 cents a kilowatt hour, you can kiss your profitability good night... unless you have a field of solar or wind turbines.

Not quite true. For tax avoidance reasons, it would be better to sell like this and give 10% discount as compared to pay ... let's say ... 30% tax.

I read that someone was transporting 100k Euro in their hand luggage in Dublin Airport. It got seized - my immediate thought was ... ughm ... why you no convert into Bitcoin !?!?

Come on. Dont be mean!
By "Bitcoin" I understand the OP means cryptocurrencies. And yes, indeed some don't use the "block chain" as such. IOTA uses a "tangle" for instance. You can Google them. Enjoy !

Sorry M8 but it's 2018. Adjusting the course dynamically based on a crypto exchange or an average of multiple exchanges is no biggie. No need to "adjust the price board". Just need the customers to know that they are not being ripped off. But who would pay for small stuff like a coffee with something HODLsome like Bitcoin anyways? ;) I know. Bitcoin is not there just to be HODLd...

This reminds me of one of my favorite graphics ... If you look into who owns the brands we all use and love, it is shocking that all is owned by a few huge players. Unilever, P&amp;G, The Coca Cola Company, Nestle, Mondelez ... you think you have a choice choosing certain brands but in the end you put money in the same pockets no matter what you choose ... quite often!

Bison. Ist eine App. Da kannst du deine Coins kaufen. Ich würde die Dann auf einen Trezor schmeißen. Oder eben eine hardware Wallet. Viel Spaß dabei :) Und nicht vergessen : not your keys, not your Bitcoin. Wenn du nur spekulieren kaufen/verkaufen magst kannst du es auch auf der App lassen.

One Coin to rule them all, 
One Coin to find them, 
One Coin to bring them all, 
and in the darkness bind them.
Any attempt of "this guy" or "those guys" making coins is not going to work.
Obviously if I was making a shitcoin, I for once, would make sure I own at least a decent percentage of such coin so that I can get filthy rich.
That's probably the purpose of this. There is enough coins out there that are "more scalable" "more stable" "more versatile" than Bitcoin. But they somehow never mention the downsides. Like adoption. Like centralization. Etc.

He knew the implications. He knew the history of the FED and ot all those who "died in freak accidents" or were publicly character assassinated to know not to officially step against the establishment of private banks.
One friend of mine also suggested that Bitcoin might be a Rothschild project itself made to fail, to establish the dominance of fiat or the dominance of a different coin "cue new MIT coin". I think it's a conspiracy theory, but who knows.

Buy privately. I would sell you some of mine, but I'm actually not selling. I will tell you more - I'm buying moooooooore. We are going to the moon, so any selling activity before mid August would be silly. Can you by thru a relative in the US ? Wire them the money and they buy it for you and send it to your hardware/paper wallet ?

The bribes have become ridiculous! Back in the good old days a few hundred thousand dollars would have pursued the commission to vote pro ETF. Now you need tens of millions of dollars ... per commissioner to bribe the lot.

It's probably why there are power outages. Need. More. Bitcoin. Said Kim. And Kim ALWAYS gets what he wants!
Seriously - we should be glad most countries are sceptical still. If they would all buy the market clean, there would be none left for us to enjoy and we couldn't afford it. So yeah, buy, while you still can. Once countries and billion dollar hedgers discover BTC, it will be unaffordable to get BTC. Hence the only way for BTC to go ... Is ... To The Moon.

Thanks for the lovely and easy instructions. I will be in touch to let you know how I got on.

The Winkelvii just didn't pay enough bribe (or could they be so naiive that they didn't pay any?) These people take sums in the single digit millions as an insult if it's not at least XX millions for a positive decision, they won't push it thru.

There is many places that will sell you Bitcoin.
Gemini or Kraken being 2 known ones.
(Where Kraken is known to have technical difficulties 90% of the time, every time).
Coinbase used to be number 1, but many people turned their back on them, once they started doing strange things and running with the wrong crowd ...
Bitstamp is a solid one. Many other small places also trading. It's up to you really. 
What you should be more concerned about is where you will store your Bitcoin. I recommend Trezor or Ledger or if you're more old-school a paper wallet.
Enjoy this brave New world of crypto - it's a great time to buy. Congrats !!! I was where you are now over a year ago - did I regret anything - nope.
@_date: 2018-07-15 07:39:55
I really enjoy these kind of smear campaigns. Someone used BITCOIN for something bad. OMG. Imagine! I wonder if FIAT money has ever been used to do something bad. I'm sure wars have never been funded with Fiat. I'm sure people don't snort cocaine with 100 dollar bills. Surely no weapon ever has been purchased with dollars. 
And never forget. People sometimes use KNIVES to kill people.
And after all hackers used COMPUTERS to hack websites and do the smear campaign.
To the average Joe it looks like Bitcoin is somehow this magic internet money that is used by all these bad people, whereas we would be much better off banning Fiat actually.

This is superb and funny the way he explains it. I rate this 8/7 would watch again. Take my upvote, kind stranger.
@_date: 2018-07-26 23:23:37
Correctly analysed. Bitcoin reigns alone. If the Winkelvii would like to have that approved, they need to bribe the people on the commission, as you do with nearly every decision by commissions in the US. But even then ... you are quite right. The banks hate Bitcoin for attempting to break their Monopoly.
@_date: 2018-07-26 23:21:08
Not a letter is needed but a bank account in an offshore account with XX million dollars each for the gentlemen on the commission. Did the Winkelvii really think they could make (potentially) Billions of dollars for free. Especially in the US without a good bribe no person in power will move a finger.

A very valid point indeed. Back at conception time AI was just at the very beginning. However I will add that places like the DoD and Darpa have tech that is 10 years ahead. So IF AI had a play in Bitcoin, it must have been at one of those places. (Not really known for good Samaritan or humanitarian work). DISCLAIMER: I, for once, welcome our new AI overlords.

You will need to contact the ISP for details about where the physcial location of their customer is. Usually they are fast giving out that info if the police are involved, so going to the cops is Paramount. Here the traceroute info: Their ISP name: Venus Business Communications Limited (seems like it will be a cafe or such where they scammed you from, but once you have a location you can see about CCTV since you know pretty exact WHEN it all happened)

I would definitely NOT recommend selling it to a private buyer for cash. I would also definitely NOT recommend using that cash for things like petrol, food, traveling expenses: i.e. all the things that you normally would pay by your cash that you work for. That way you would avoid taxation and "save" the money that you have to spend anyways. But I definitely DONT recommend it, because it's superb to pay taxes.
@_date: 2018-07-28 14:28:11

Volatility is number 1 I think. Most stocks you can jump into within a few % difference in value within a week or two, whereas it's not uncommon to see XX% in Bitcoin. People are scared NOT to buy the dip. But I usually explain to them that the best time to buy Bitcoin is always a year ago. Moon will come.
Other personal reasons I have found within myself before getting into it:
1. FUD articles in the "independent" media. About Bitcoin crashing, dying, bubbling, etc.
2. Where to buy bitcoin. So many places, with very complicated fees and ways of paying for the coins. The weirdest was coinbase asking for a fee to buy but suddenly gdax being free and both being the same company just blew my mind.
3. Storage. Boy oh boy is this one complicated. From paper wallets, thru cold storages, hot storages, thru on-phone apps, online wallets, hardware wallets, software wallets, Bitcoin core app ... 
4. The nitty gritty. Forks - hard and soft. How to extract the forked coin. Where to sell the forked shitcoin like bch.
5. Where'd you come from where'd you go. Unknown daddy of Bitcoin. Fear it might be a giant scam.
6. Implementation of the HODL mentality. Never sell, only buy. It's hard.
Can't think of any more major ones.

If you really want to be anonymous, you would set up a mining operation with 3-4 miners that will have enough power to break you even in 1-2 years (where you will have gotten the money you paid for the miners back in Bitcoin). It's not a terrible idea.
However people are right. You would need to join a pool and depending the pool, you will need to identify yourself one way or another.
Nice thing about your idea is that after 1-2 years your hardware will continue making Bitcoin for you, so you will be starting to profit. (Of course depending on how much your electricity is).

Looks like your friend who stole your money is in Figino, a small place near Milano, Italy. If that is the correct IP address. Could be a proxy. I ran a traceroute for you. That's where it goes.  There are cafes around there, which leads me to believe it could be there. I would call the cops. Maybe someone can find the exact place where the IP goes to. Knowing these cybercriminals they probably used a WiFi in a cafe. But who knows ? Maybe CCTV caught them. Worth a try. Don't know if canacops will be helpful. Might be worth hiring a PI in Italy who could check things out locally. I would help locally, but I'm far away from Milano. You basically need to have people there that will investigate.

I wonder what the percentage of female hodlers or bitcoineers is. I understand that given this is in the investment AND computers realm it is probably really miniscule.
DISCLAIMER: No, I don't think women are stupid or unable to understand or unwilling to implement technology, etc. It probably still is the traditional "men do the investing" and "there is no women on the internet" mentality that causes our female hodlers and bitcoineers to be in the minority.
A few examples:
1.I have a very smart doctor friend. She says she is "bad at investing" I do give her the Bitcoin talk every now and again, but despite being incredibly smart, she won't join the hodlgang. She's not much into computers.
2.Cousin is into computers. Doesn't care at all about investing. Thinks Bitcoin is lol and rofl. Again doesn't feel like investing is something worthwhile.
3.Big Boss is all into investing. Finds Bitcoin interesting but she finds it confusing how to buy and store, therefore did not buy any coin yet.
I totally would date a female hodler straight away. Cryptogirls are sexy ;)

"Point of view depends on your seats' location". 
I think this can be applied to Stiglitz.
I am not surprised about his views on btc and crypto.
Old systems money, old systems values. Sure he is hating it as much as any of his flock.
Same with a certain man promoting btcCASH. Sure he is going to hate it; he put his money on a different horse and he wants to see core die.
I for once love Bitcoin ... and the more people hate on it and the more the old system frowns upon it, the better I know it is getting. Buy, HODL ... Profit.
