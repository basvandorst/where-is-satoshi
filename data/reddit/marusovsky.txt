Never heard about that. So how much is the initial downpayment?

That is part of the reason why I decided to take the plunge. As in, I would like to cash out part of it (for some things). But I'm looking at it as more than just an investment. I can't exactly put it into words other than I just have a very strong gut-feeling that Bitcoin will be the thing that will allow me and many others to achieve freedom and security both financial and otherwise. But I have to stay vigilant and be informed of developments. My goal now is to try to get a total of around 0.12BTC before years end.

Haha, sorry not 12btc (that would be Hella expensive) .12btc which is teeny tiny but I gotta start having a plan me think. Sorry for the confusion.

I am considering it. As I have an ok machine, should still be possible to churn out a smidgen of a BTC. Just wondering on how to go about doing. Any suggestions?

Thank you, I am actually strongly considering it. Question however, if I do decide I want to go the paper route, how do I do so? And in my current state, with Coinbase? Any tutorial links you could recommend?

I understand and am aware, but as the hungry little bytepiller that I am, I'm willing to use their service for the moment until I reach my current goal of around .12btc before years end. By which point I should have better understanding and knowledge on what should be my next steps. But of course, if there are better services, such as Gemini which appears to be a popular alternative I might go to them, or do something else entirely.

Really?! How does it work exactly? And what kind of equipment is required or does almost anything current do?
