Well, it's 2 weeks later... Any update?

I'm sorry if I'm mistaken - not an expert here - but don't most professional greenhouses, legal or otherwise, keep the lights on 24/7 for maximum photosynthesis yield? Plants don't need 'sleep'

Something is amiss with your link; it redirects straight to this Marc dude's Facebook page.

I stand corrected. Thanks :)

Can you tell us more about what you think is happening, and how this affects Bitcoin disproportionately?

Surely any kind of GUI is going to load up the graphics card, if only a little bit?

He must have had some intense hardware, probably a dedicated rig with several graphics cards all running 24/7. That constant 24hr baseload, never fluctuating, is what would give a potential grower of certain interesting substances away - their high-powered lights are on all day and night, which is totally different to the usage pattern in an average domestic property (all over the place, due to things going on and off)
That said, any serious miner needs to work out their bitcoin return against money spent on electricity, and for that you need a Kill-A-Watt to measure what your PC is using!

Thanks for talking about your setup, that sounds like quite the build. Re: airflow and front-mounted intake fans, I'm not at a point where I need RAID just yet, so it'd only be single-disk for now - however, what's the general consensus on cooling stressed graphics cards if intake fans blowing already-warm air across the case are generally a no?  just lots of exhaust? 
My potential build is further complicated by the fact that, for a variety of reasons, it may need to end up living in a very dusty workshop. Perhaps liquid-cooled would actually produce fewer headaches in that scenario...

Have you looked at [BitMarket.eu](http:// BitMarket.eu)? They accept Paypal and a few different types of international wire transfers.
