You say that the blocks are downloading, but have all blocks been downloaded?

Seven of the world's ten fastest growing economies are African countries. We only tend to hear about the catastrophes. If there is somewhere Bitcoin can take off it's in areas that are living through large changes; the developing world, in contrast to the ~~industrial~~ stagnating world. :P
Old video, but worth thinking about:

I mailed bitmarket with the mail address on the "Contact" button in a similar situation after three days of waiting. They in turn mailed the other party and suddenly the situation was resolved. I wish you the same luck.
First you should mail the seller however if you have not already done so.

I believe they use the thermal pad of the packages for heat sinking. The thermal pads are connected to the ground layers of the board. A larger board means more area to use for cooling the chips.
I can only think of two benefits of a more densely packed board; a smaller board is cheaper and it takes less space. But those benefits are extremely small compared to the improvement in heat sinking of the less densely packed board.
I think the design looks very professional. Very nice with the amount of metal on top of the board, for heat sinking as well as EMI control.

I just meant the top layer, it's used as a ground layer.
