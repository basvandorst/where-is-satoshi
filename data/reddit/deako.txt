True, but PHP has a bad reputation for producing insecure code. It's simple and easy to learn, but producing PHP that is secure and sanitize all inputs takes some competence and lots of patience and rigor.

In a way, this is almost the same thing that profBS said, although with some difference in choice of language.

Bitcoins have already taken off where it's appropriate for them to be used. Just don't expect to buy your morning coffee with them.

It is technically possible, but it is very difficult and/or time consuming. It would be much easier to just counterfeit USD.

You're right about inexperienced entrepreneurs getting into Bitcoin. A while ago, I almost caught myself wanting to start an Internet cafe with an emphasis on Bitcoin. Then I did some research, and realized just how much work that sort of thing is. I'd still like to do it, but it won't be the walk in the park that I had thought it would be.
I think it's more related to young men and women with ties to "geek culture" are more readily accepting the idea of cryptocurrency, without actually considering the pitfalls of starting their own business. Even if it works, Bitcoin is not some panacea, but just a new version of a very old concept; currency.

They didn't say anything about coins made of bits, though, that's the point. The law at this point hasn't said anything about bitcoin, whether it's recognised as a currency or as a counterfeit currency.

She never really said that a bitcoin Porn site would fail, she just said that it would take A) the same amount of work which traditional sites do, which is a lot more than "Zack and Miri Make a Porno", and also that B) It would take a much different way of thinking, probably with business models more akin to the pre-Internet sex industry than to contemporary porn sites.

Jessy was really informative, but I kind of felt bad that she was wasting her time with Vegetta. Hopefully someone else got some useful information.
EDIT: Also, I like the part where BitCoinPorn says not to mock Vegetta's spelling and grammar, and then immediately attacks Jessy for her typo.

Totally agree, although it's worth pointing out (with regards to the third point addressed) that Bitcoin has the ability to modify supply on its own, given the two opposing forces; number of miners and computational difficulty. As long as these two opposing forces maintain equilibrium, Bitcoin will be perhaps *more* stable than any human-run Central Banks.

I've always took BitCoin to refer to this current protocol, and as it says in your article, changing the hash or anything else that's a part of the protocol effectively changes the protocol and thus creates a new variety of cryptocurrency.
I suppose the best way to combat this would be to make the next generation of cryptocurrency self-evolving, although then it would still be impossible to address problems of human error in the implementation; It would have to be done perfectly the first time.
Also, I think that there are some strong cultural notions of the permanency of currency. It may be that if cryptocurrency prevails, we would have to deal with it by investing in stocks and companies rather than just letting it sit a decrease in value. Each generation of cryptocurrency would have a shelf-life, and would devalue itself from year to year as the time for a new generation approaches, and so goods and stocks would be more desirable than the currency itself. If this happens, there would probably be some standard meta-currency value that each generation of cryptocurrency is compared to, similar to how the Brazillian Real was used to combat inflation.
Anyhow, great article that raises some good questions.

I'm no expert by any means, but I think more people have been getting into bitcoin recently. But the rate of usership (and thus, the rate at which bitcoins are being created) is rising while there still isn't a huge demand for bitcoins. I'm not a big money guy, so I'd say just keep mining and don't buy bitcoins in large amounts until you really need to (if your national currency becomes unreliable, or when a preferred retailer or charity of yours starts to accept them). What bitcoin really needs at this point is more retailer acceptance to create demand. If you hear that Amazon is starting to accept bitcoins, for example, that will probably help the BTC a lot.

Probably more accurate than [the original PA comic]( this is based on.

Wow, you know that the geeks have won when prostitutes accept bitcoin as payment.

If it ever gets adopted by mainstream e-commerce sites, then it will be a vastly better alternative to paypal. Exactly when/if that will happen can be up for debate. I'm assuming you just use paypal for buying, and that's fine. But retailers on Paypal spend a lot of money just to get your money, and there are lots of horror stories about smaller retailers getting locked out and their funds seized for no real reason at all.
Bitcoin would eliminate that, and they would only have to pay a small transfer fee which is also optional.

Except that the votes don't matter if there's no demand for the payment. The democratic value comes from that demand.

I kind of wondered if I would get this response. All the same, Alberta has a racism problem, especially where natives are concerned.

He isn't incorrect about anything, just putting it in an inflammatory perspective. That being said, I also wouldn't recommend moving to Canada if you were a gun-toting race-hating tea-partier. Alberta has enough of them.

Variance in this case means that although there might be short term losses, there is an overwhelming likelihood that there will be long term gains. You could possibly lose out, but it is extremely unlikely unless your customers are consistently winning. The dice game leans in your favour, not the customers.

This is true, but that's mainly because their original demographic was people with a religious background or family history, so that an existing support network would be there to help. The anonymous program is somewhat antiquated and is now akin to brainwashing more than it used to be.
@_date: 2013-05-13 06:31:07
Keep in mind I said overwhelming likelihood, not a guarantee. Also the martingale strategy is played from the better's perspective, not the house's, and so it's applied to games with a zero or a negative expected return. The house will never have games that give the better a positive expected return, unless they just want to give away money. 
Casinos in general have the edge over the better, but the real risk is in whether or not that edge can compensate for maintenance costs and other expenses in actually running the casino. 
A casino of course is like any business venture, it's an investment with its own risks involved. However, unlike throwing dice, there are many more variables that you can predict and manipulate. If you do your homework, select a good location, reliable staff, and take proper safety and security measures, running a casino can be a very stable investment.

It does not, but it is a feature of NFC, Near Field Communication, which is the same technology that works in credit cards can tap to pay at stores, and newer android phones that can pick up signals from NFC tags.

No, I don't gamble. But I'm sure that there are a lot of sore losers out there, and the last thing you want to deal with is a fool with nothing left to lose.

It is because of lawyers and those people who are concerned with ownership of information media that copyrights exist. Open source licenses such as the GPL attempt to act as a "copyleft", by using the copyright system against itself (hence the viral nature of the GPL).
It doesn't always work as well as we'd like, but if you acknowledge that then you must also realize that your objective is not dissimilar.
@_date: 2013-11-25 10:34:19
Why do you think licenses and copyrights are necessary in the first place?
@_date: 2013-08-01 22:24:40
So why is that better regulated than a decentralised deflationary currency that is produced at a predictable rate? The regulations for bitcoin have been established and can only be changed by how much mining is taking place. How is that not democratic?
