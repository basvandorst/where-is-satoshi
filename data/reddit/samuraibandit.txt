I don't want to be mean, but that is some seriously ignorant shit right there. 
Have you never taken a math class?


I'm going to assume you're a troll and trying to make it onto because the idea that you could honestly believe all the nonsense you just said makes me really sad. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:52:29
What exactly is your goal? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:15:40
Like I already said before:


@_date: 2017-12-18 20:19:43


While it's true that the thought "I'm better because of my race" does exist in some people's minds, that doesn't make it objectively true.
And "Nazi" is just what many call people who have that thought.
You're either very confused (because opinions are entirely different things than believing in something exists that doesn't) or you're a very low effort troll. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:31:08


Really? 
Go ahead and demonstrate how to divide 5 by 7 using subtraction alone.
Edit: Even in a perfect example where subtraction applies, your logic breaks down.
Take 6 ÷ 2 for example
6 - 2 = 4 (that's once)     
4 - 2 = 2 (that's twice)     
2 - 2 = 0 (that's three times)     
Therefore 6 ÷ 2 = 3
The only way to prove you're done is by reaching zero, and the answer is then verified by taking the answer and multiplying it by the divisor:
3 × 2 = 6
So take 6 ÷ 0 now:
6 - 0 = 0
Even if you keep doing that forever, you never actually reach zero, and you never actually get an answer.
Infinity is *not* the answer, however, because infinite possible iterations *in pursuit* of the answer is not the same thing as infinity *being* the answer.
If infinity were the answer then you could test it by multiplying it by the divisor and get the original number.
Does infinity × 0 = 6 ?
Of course not. Because it's not the answer. There is no answer; it's undefined.

That's debatable at best. 
Regardless, look at the problem we're talking about - percent of increase in profits.
Profits can be negative (loss), which means the number set is ~~integers~~ all rational numbers (since there can be decimals) , not natural numbers. 
The rules for natural numbers don't apply by definition. 


Right back at ya. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:23:05
So what? That's not what we're talking about.
"infinitely more profit" means "profit2 is infinite percent larger than profit1."
You find the percentage of increase by taking the difference and dividing by profit1.
In this case, profit1 is no profit at all, or zero.
That makes the percentage calculation:
9,000 / 0 = undefined 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:01:41
Nope. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:22:33


LOL, what? 
That's not true at all. Who  told you that?
The fact that all numbers divided by zero is undefined is the *reason* a variable divided by zero is undefined. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:41:30


Well then why would you think those rules apply to zero in the first place?
Zero is not a natural number. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:59:30




Look at [the comment]( I initially replied to. 
It says **nothing** about ROI. 
What it *does* say is "infinitely **more profit** than he had **originally**."
(ironic how you just told me to "read the fucking thread," though.)
"infinitely more profit" means "profit2 is infinite percent larger than profit1."
You find the percentage of increase (or decrease) by taking the difference and dividing by profit1. 
(p2 - p1) /p1
In this case, profit1 is no profit at all, or zero.
That makes the percentage calculation:
(9,000 - 0) / 0 = undefined
Also, 


Check the usernames. It didn't take me three days to reply - I was just looking over the thread and saw you arguing with someone else.
You should probably pay more attention if you're going to be such an asshole about "reading the thread." 
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:08:18


That's because you didn't actually perform the calculation, and you don't seem to understand how division works or what "remainder" means. 
If there had been 2 grapes left, and you cut each monkey into 2 pieces, then the total number of monkeys would still be 4. They'd just each be in 2 pieces. 
Does that mean that 4 / 2 = 4? 
Of course not. 
(Edit: to clarify, the answer to the calculation is asking what the size of each monkey part is after dividing them: ½ of a monkey. Conversely, you can't answer the question "what's the size of the individual monkey parts after dividing by zero" because that calculation can't be done - you haven't performed the division.)
Is English not your first language? Most of your misinterpretation seems to come from not understanding that common language and math terns are not the same. 


Then you should know this already.

@_date: 2017-12-21 21:06:28
So all this is just to get someone to say you might be right in the hypothetical, unlikely event that the fundamental principles of mathematics were ever rewritten - just to avoid admitting that *right now* you are *completely wrong*? 
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:45:39
From the third sentence at the top of that page:


@_date: 2017-12-17 20:29:38
Dividing by zero is undefined, not infinite.
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:22:00
It's undefined - it isn't anything.
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:13:58
Nope, just more than you, apparently. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:28:31
People also talk about wizards and unicorns.
Talking about something doesn't mean it exists. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:57:05
If you take a number and divide it by something and end up with the same number, then the number you've divided by is one, not zero.
You're thinking that "divide by nothing" means "don't divide." That's not the case. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:01:38
That wasn't the question you asked.
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:24:27
Yep. The imaginary number, i, is the square root of negative 1.

A limit is not the same thing as the actual result of a calculation. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:48:56
Again, from your source:


It's a pretty simple concept.
Refusing to accept it doesn't make it complicated, it just means you're favoring your own uninformed opinion over those of mathematicians through the ages. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:46:39


It's no more plausible than claiming unicorns exist. 


IT'S A NUMERICAL CONCEPT. NOT A THING THAT WAS DISCOVERED. 


BECAUSE IT WAS DELIBERATELY CREATED AND REFINED TO HAVE A PARTICULAR MEANING.
THERE IS NOTHING REMAINING TO "DISCOVER" ABOUT IT. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:05:32
Things that only exist in your mind do not actually exist.
Like your understanding of this topic, for example. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:50:24
Fuck off and troll someone else. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:17:16
It doesn't exist. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:01:29


You calculate limits the same way regardless of the value of x. That's the entire reason of using a variable in the first place.


No, percentage of increased profit requires dividing but initial profit, not by the initial investment amount.
Profit can be zero and can also be negative (loss).
So the limit from the left is negative infinity, and the limit from the right is positive infinity. The limit is undefined, just like the result of dividing by zero in the first place.
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:30:34
If the equation in question is a simple arithmetic problem, why would you think rules other than arithmetic apply?


Right back at ya.
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:16:45
...dividing by zero is undefined. It's not a matter of opinion.
It's something that simply cannot be done, by nature of the definitions of the mathematics for "divide" and "zero."
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:07:36
It's not a matter of figuring out of, it's that the definition of the concept of zero makes it undefined.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:57:33
Zero is a concept defined by humans, not a physical object that was discovered and can be studied to learn more about it. 
It, as a defined concept, only behaves in precise ways according to the defined concepts of the mathematical systems in which it is used. In this case, dividing a rational number by zero is always undefined 
There is no new knowledge that can change that fact.
