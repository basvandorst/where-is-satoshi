Don't preach / sell / pitch bitcoin to anyone around you.  You're new to btc and you get it so you're smack in the middle of the excitement phase.  
Just keep to yourself and if someone asks about it make it sounds like no big deal.  That will make them more genuinely curious and maybe lead them to discover it on their own.  No amount of personal hype will convince your friends / family / coworkers around you.

I have their android wallet and use their service.  The app is okay but a little glitchy on my S3.  Their vault gives me peace of mind as I have no access to a printer or am not confident enough in my tech savviness to properly do cold storage.

I bought my 1st btc in Sept '13.  
Before then, I kept seeing people tip other people on reddit with this mysterious internet money.  I did a little research on the ole google machine, checked out and immediately thought it was the dumbest thing I had ever heard of. Basically I concluded it was internet money for nerds.
Then I learned about silk road and saw the 1st real world application of btc and began to take a second look.  It caught my interest and I took a blind leap with my purchase in Sept. '13.  Then we had the huge run up in November '13 and now I'm btc for life.  Of course I care about the price, but now I'm much more fascinated by the technology and rapidly expanding ecosystem.
I plan to be working in the crypto industry within 2-4 years.  It has transformed my views on government, saving money, and markets.  I've gone down the btc rabbit hole quite a ways since Sept '13; I'm extremely grateful I found btc.

Why would Uber accept btc? Bitcoin is a push mechanism not a pull.  So what happens if I take a $50 uber ride but only have $25 btc in my wallet?

That's the instant feature.  I recommend using the "name your discount" feature.  There are people out there who want to buy bitcoins without going through coinbase or an exchange.  So instead, you pay for your goods with your discount in BTC and purse holds the BTC in escrow while the buyer of your btc will buy your amazon goods with their credit card.  Once you've confirmed you've received your goods, purse releases your bitcoins to the amazon buyer.

Are you having a fake or real disagreement? I never hear you guys argue on your podcast.

I suggest everyone accept that bitcoin today is not the best or preferred method for day to day transactions for 99% of North Americans, Europeans, Japanese, and Chinese citizens.
Bitcoin performs best where traditional payments cannot (online gambling, cross border value transfer, DNMs).
There may (probably) be a day when millions of people are using bitcoin to buy regular goods, but that day is years away - and that's okay.
Be patient and don't focus on getting rich quick.

I'd buy that. Make a copy and take my money!

good job, boomer
@_date: 2015-04-02 02:04:44
I have the feeling you don't really care that much.  I have another suspicion that your coinbase account is already toggled for showing BTC and not bits.
So bithugs, why not step back and let Coinbase do its best to introduce bitcoin to new users.  You know exactly why they're doing this.
 
@_date: 2015-04-18 20:43:45
Can you share anything he talked about? 
@_date: 2015-04-07 19:08:14
It's nice to see you back around here, I knew you wouldn't be gone for long when you announced your departure 2-3 weeks ago :)

Was up, Peggy.  I was wondering when we'd get your next post.  I enjoy your writing as it inspires good speculation.
@_date: 2015-09-04 15:18:39

Pure A grade Hopium.  We should be careful about speculating with charts like this.

What do you use Bitcoin for? How often do you spend it? Are you inconvenienced to the point where you refuse to use it? If you're too inconvenienced, Bitcoin doesn't make sense for you.

Alright. I'm happy to read this comment from you.  You're a frequent poster around here and from what I can recall you've been fairly negative about bitcoin from time to time.
I'm pleasantly surprised to see a change in your tone.  You're a random internet stranger who I'll never know but for what it's worth it's nice to see a change in people.

What is your business and why are people suddenly flocking to using bitcoin for your product(s) in your opinion?
If you want day to day use with Bitcoin then are you admittedly supporting Seg Wit?

Thank you, Roger.

Here's a screen shot from my coinbase hot wallet. I paid from my mobile app and copy paste from my browser [
@_date: 2015-03-30 20:43:40
I had the same experience. I even sent 2 payments to 1EarvpwqzfKPw3PHRPhMwXbEVXkzxnh56s just to be sure, all I got was nothing.  At first I was excited about the cheap paywall concept but it doesn't work and I have to move on now.
Good idea, but obviously not ready for prime time.  I'm very annoyed. Booooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
can you help us?
