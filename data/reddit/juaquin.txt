With that graphics card, probably not. If you had a newer card it's worth it. I'm running a 6850 and an older 4870 for ~300Mhash/s combined, which makes about 2BTC/day. They run all day with a low priority, so when I'm gaming it drops dramatically and when watching video it gets cut about in half.

With a CPU, you're looking at like a year (or more) before you hit a block. Bitcoins are only made when a block is found, and you get 50. So of course, your balance is 0 right now because your machine hasn't found a block. What you could do is mine for a pool, and then you'd get tiny payments every few hours.
@_date: 2011-06-21 08:08:46
I do not know the exact details, but yes, the pool decides what transactions will be included in the blocks that it's miners try to build. If this happens, everyone else just accepts that it's correct (over the true block chain) because it's included in a block that 51%+ of clients say is correct.
@_date: 2011-06-29 23:35:35
That's not true at all. It's true that mining is most efficient when you have low electricity costs, and it's true that some people are better off not mining. But if it were to happen that electricity cost more than bitcoins were worth, and people stopped mining, then there would be a larger demand for bitcoins (assuming the currency was still sought after), and the value of bitcoins would go up to a point where it was profitable again. I don't think anyone understand the stability inherently built into the system. Sure, the entire currency could collapse, but it would be because of social or political causes (or someone finding an exploit).
@_date: 2011-04-20 18:28:51
Good to hear.
@_date: 2011-05-16 05:41:19
I don't get what's false. 5 years is a bit much (more like 5 weeks), but it IS true that mining on any CPU is a waste of time with GPU mining out there.

I don't think this is an issue of "don't use the cloud" (although there are good arguments for it). This could have been simply prevented with a local backup. Why the owner never downloaded encrypted backups is mind-boggling.
@_date: 2011-04-23 22:55:17
With CPUs you'll spend more money on electricity than you'll make back from bitcoin generation. If you're simply interested in how it works, go for it, but if you're doing this for profit you'd be losing.

Should ask the Senator if he has some cash in his pocket. Some ridiculous percentage of cash (all?) has traces of drugs on it. Yes Senator, at some point the cash in your wallet was used to purchase drugs and probably laundered. What's your point?
@_date: 2011-06-29 22:05:48
Yes, so when the difficulty drops, some of those 5830's will join (some will have sold, some will have given up, some just won't rejoin). That will slightly raise the difficulty, causing some to stop again. Repeat continuously, with less change each cycle, until reaching equilibrium (think pendulum that eventually stabilizes). Clearly, with so many variables, it will never be stable, but I don't think there's going to be a continuous huge yo-yo effect that you seem to be suggesting. We haven't seen that happen yet and I doubt we ever will. And even if it does, so what? If you want to play the mining game then you play by its rules.
@_date: 2011-07-01 02:10:53
I agree with the SSDs (what in the world are those going to do for mining?!), but cases are useful. They help keep dust out of the heatsinks (important with all the heat generated), provide mechanical stability, make sure nothing bad happens to it.
@_date: 2011-06-21 07:47:15
I don't think you understand. If you control &gt;51% of mining, you control the creation of blocks and which transactions go into those blocks. Let's say that during the crash Person A withdrew 100 coins from Mt Gox (let's call Mt Gox account B). All the mining pools would have to do is instruct the connected miners to include a transaction of 100 coins from B to A and voila, bitcoins are back where they were before. 
This is the reason you see all those posts warning about DeepBit making up more than 50% of mining resources. The network follows what the majority of the network considers to be the "proper" blockchain. If the majority of the block-creating network is controlled, it can create it's own version of the blockchain and it will be taken as "proper".
There's no cracking involved here. It's simply a function of how bitcoin works.
@_date: 2011-06-09 04:19:08
Well you have to choose then. Sleep or tacky lights.
@_date: 2011-04-20 06:29:00
Keep in mind that even if you join a pool, you'll still make about 50 coins over 4590 days (depending on how they share profits). Just this way, you'll receive those 50 coins spread out instead of all at once. That breaks down to a coin every ~90 days. At current rates you'd be making ~$1.20 every three months. Unless you're using a GPU it's not worth the electricity.
@_date: 2011-05-19 05:09:05
The problem is that there is not a complete cycle of bitcoin-accepting industries right now. Eventually, someone has to pay for something in USD (or whatever local currency), so the price of everything up the chain has to be somewhat dependent on the dollar.
Eventually, yes, that would be great. For now, it's practically a necessity for any store that wants to stay afloat to link their BTC prices to the USD exchange rate.
@_date: 2011-06-17 03:38:58
You still don't understand. There are no fake headers, there are no fake blocks. The pool does not assign "easy" problems. AFAIK the pool simply tells you what transactions are to go into the block and tracks how much work you've done. Your GPU then goes about adding nonces to the transaction data until it generates a sufficiently low hash. Proof of work is simply when you generate a low hash. The pool may ask to be notified when you've gotten a hash below 000ac3af42fc31103f1fdc0151fa747ff87349a, which proves that you're working but you're not quite there. When you hit a hash below 0000c3af42fc31103f1fdc0151fa747ff87349a, you've actually generated a block. 
The pool never assigns you "fake" data or "fake" problems. The fact that pooled mining generates the same amount as solo mining (over a sufficiently long period to even out variation) is proven both theoretically and in practice, therefore your understanding of how it works is clearly incorrect.


If anyone said that, they are incorrect. Being able to generate fake work doesn't prove anything. If that was the case, for all the pool knows I could be solving their stupid problem once every 30s and doing nothing else the rest of the time. Obviously, that is not the case.

Sorry, I should have specified that I meant sites that exchange for cash over Paypal. Of course, smaller operators (like  may fly under the radar for awhile, but it seems that Paypal is taking a pretty clear stance.
@_date: 2011-06-16 17:40:21
Please read up on how distributed mining works before telling someone else they're wrong. The controller accepts hashes of lower difficulty than are actually required to solve a block, so it can see that you're working. Of course, your pool only gets a block when you've happened to solve a hash of full current difficulty. For instance, my miner finds a hash worth reporting to the pool every 30s or so, but has only found 3 blocks in the two months I've been mining.
@_date: 2011-06-30 01:00:53
If you want to use gold mining as an analogy, let's say that for some reason it started to cost too much money to mine gold. Maybe drills become really expensive. So all the gold miners say "screw this" and quit. After a while, gold presumably becomes more rare, and as such people are willing to pay more for it (to an extent). Once it hits some amount, the miners say "hey lets go back to work" because gold is now expensive enough to afford those expensive drills. Etc. It takes awhile to stabilize, but it does. This isn't about numbers, it's about understanding how economies work.
@_date: 2011-06-29 19:38:16
Yeah there will be some back and forth, and variations caused by newer better hardware, etc. But the system will always self-stabilize to a certain extent. 
@_date: 2011-05-05 19:47:27
Benefits are obvious. Turning down the speed will turn down current draw. Less power used, less heat generated. Would it be very noticeable? Probably not, but go for it if you want to. I leave my memory overclocked because I game on the card too.
@_date: 2011-06-30 01:21:28
Yeah, mining prices do not effect commodity prices. Commodity prices affect mining activity (whether or not it is worth it to mine at certain mining costs). This has been discussed at length on the forums, please read there if you still don't believe it. I eagerly await the day when no one is mining because it is not profitable, please let me know when it happens. Even if it was not profitable to mine for 50btc, people would still mine if only to record their transactions. Otherwise the currency would be unusable. Is that what you're suggesting?
@_date: 2011-06-17 01:40:29
I still think you don't understand how bitcoin works, because I have no idea what you're trying to say.
Let's say generating hashes is like guessing random numbers. Let's say that the difficulty level is 10. What that means is that if your computer generates a number less than 10, it has found a block. Every time your computer finds a number under 20, it'll tell the pool "Hey, I found a number that was close!" and the pool will say "Cool, good job, I've recorded that you're working hard. Keep going!". This happens every ~30s on my machine. When your computer finds a number under 10, it tells the pool, the pool says "Awesome, we win!" and it sends out that block to all of the bitcoin network to be recorded, awarding the pool 50 BTC. This happens every 3-4 weeks on my machine.
If I was solo mining, the computer would just be silent until I found a block - it doesn't need to report close guesses, because it doesn't need to prove that it's working to anyone. Both solo and pool mining return almost exactly the same amount - pool mining just spreads the reward out over time, so you make 1BTC per day rather than 50 every 50 days.
All those numbers you guessed were not wasted, they are simply attempts. *There no "fake" blocks, they are simply hashes of a block that did not quite meet the level needed.* If it was possible to guess a number under 10 all the time, obviously we would. But we can't, and so we keep trying different hashes until we find one under the difficulty level.
@_date: 2011-06-30 04:38:14
Exactly. We should make a flowchart.
@_date: 2011-06-21 08:26:11
That's the idea. Some of the posts are a little overzealous, but they have a point. Here's a graph to keep tabs on it:

Yes, I think he was supporting what you were saying. 104C is the absolute max, so 90C+ would be not recommended (as you said).

Well, if you got a couple mining pools behind it, you could. Not that it would be ethical, but you could.

So then why are you hanging out in the Bitcoin subreddit? To harass people?
@_date: 2011-05-16 06:00:46
I think if Bitcoin only caters to markets that require secrecy, it will come under fire from governments. Sure, they can't stop it, but they can prosecute until very few people want to be involved. I think the key to Bitcoin becoming a real currency is using it in mainstream markets. If Amazon started accepting Bitcoin tomorrow, it would surge in popularity and make it less likely that governments would try to shut it down.
@_date: 2011-04-30 23:38:58
Looks like Paypal has frozen the accounts of all the exchange sites. Wonder if it was because of a surge in account activity due to the jump in value.
@_date: 2011-06-29 07:16:15
And when bitcoin mining becomes too expensive for the average person, a lot of people will shut down their rigs, and the difficulty will go down. Everything will stabilize.

I just switched over to this pool, but I'm getting a whole bunch of "warning: job finished, miner is idle" and "long poll: new block". I've seen "long poll" before on Slush's pool (although much more rarely) - the part that concerns me is the idle bit. Is this normal?
@_date: 2011-06-17 01:52:27
There are no "fake" blocks. A block is a record of all transactions. Your computer takes those transactions along with some random numbers it guesses and feeds those through a hash algorithm. If the result of the hash is below the difficulty threshold, it is a *valid* block. Because of the random part of that hash, the miner has to try over and over until it finds a hash that works. It's like playing a guessing game.
Here's some info on what hashing is: 
@_date: 2011-05-21 18:25:59
Right now, electricity cost is secondary to the cost of the hardware (GPUs) itself. Unless FPGA mining is noticeably faster than a GPU for the same cost, it shouldn't be a threat. Has anyone seen solid hash numbers for FPGAs?
@_date: 2011-07-21 20:24:54
Nope, the network factors the difficulty based on the rate. It tries to keep the rate at one block every ten minutes. If during the last period the rate was higher than that, it will increase the difficulty. If the difficulty gets to a point where a lot of people quit and the rate drops below that, the difficulty will then be decreased. It's self-stabilizing.
@_date: 2011-06-30 01:04:03
Well it's more like if they stopped mining gold, the value would go up because it was rare. And then people would mine again because it was worth enough to be profitable. The producers will respond to the demands of the market. Barring any large external influences, economies like this tend to stabilize.
@_date: 2011-05-10 05:53:56


Correct me if I'm wrong but I believe difficulty is simply based on how many blocks have been created. I believe the network tries to set the difficulty such that a block is created roughly every 10 minutes.
@_date: 2011-07-01 06:01:51
Yes, I completely agree with you on the SSDs (which is what I said). My only argument is that cases are important, even if it's just a basic $40 Rosewill.
