I mathed it, we're at $2.77 EV for the $2 ticket (not including taxes).

Do you still mine for BitcoinPool?  I'm assuming you're the same Internet151.

Interesting theory.  I nearly thought there could be a connection between the botnets and the price drop, but I never got there.
@_date: 2011-07-05 22:19:17
Linking ddosing to blacklisted botnets was made by btcguild themselves when their site was down, so that's undisputed.  We're musing that the large sell order was placed by some entity related to that.

I noticed a 10-20% or so hit with crossfire engaged (6950's).  You'll just need to test and figure if disabling/enabling in CCC is worth it every time you want to game. 
edit: 10-20% on one card (think it was the primary).  The other remained constant if I remember correctly.

I look at it like this: you're either putting coins in a slot machine that potentially pays out several dollars every several hours, or pays out a few dollars every few hours.  I think it's just basic human psychology that people prefer to be rewarded consistently, despite that statistics show that you'd receive the same reward over time.
This is the main danger I see with pools.  As difficulty goes up, people will be drawn to the pools that have larger collective hash rates (consistent payouts).  Why stay in a smaller pool that potentially gives 1.0 BTC a day when you can consistently get .125 BTC every 3 hours?  Over time the payout is the same, but people see the longer round times (12 hours per round for .5 BTC a round) vs. the consistent rewards (2 hour rounds with .083).
And as a miner myself, it's not the income that's the motivation.  It's the capitalization on mining as many BTC as possible before the next difficulty increase.  Personally, I'm still a bit idealistic and stay away from pools that require tutelage (I prefer free pools that accept donations), but there's still the "luck" factor where smaller pools that should solve blocks every 12 hours (on paper) take over a day before anything is solved.
That's a bit of a problem, but the real problem is when difficulty increases and the "luck" factor causes even more problems for smaller pools.  What happens when pools should statistically solve blocks every 4 days?  I'd hazard a guess that people will congregate in pools that minimize the "luck" factor so they don't have to wait a week for any kind of payout.

It's a response to Ixcoin, which itself is a Bitcoin fork.  Ixcoin was criticized because there were already 100,000's of Ixcoins prior to the fork becoming public, which means the creator has the majority of the supply.
I0Coin is new fork, with the "0" meaning there are no pregenerated blocks.  Parameters of I0coin are tweaked to improve the client and protocol (blocks being found every 5 minutes, difficulty going up every 2016 blocks or 2 weeks, whichever comes first, etc).
I think I0coin is an experiment just to see a new fork in action with a level playing field.  I don't think anyone is taking it very seriously, but it will be interesting to watch.

Breaking the habbit of browsing Reddit while mining was one of the hardest habbits I break.

While I like bitcoinpool, I would imagine that the OP is looking for the biggest pools in order to minimize the unlucky "swings."
@_date: 2011-07-05 18:12:16
BTCGuild and BitcoinPool banned a botnet of CPU miners.  I'm assuming it's a retaliatory attack.

Their website is aesthetically pleasing, they have a dedicated forum, their administrators work hard to improve the site and are active in the community, and it's a 0%-fee pool.  Their commitment to efficiency is different, although they get a lot of flak for it.
I'd mine there more, but they do have intermittent connection issues.  Though it looks like they're bringing more server capacity online.

Btcguild said it came from an isp in Russia.

While the PCI card itself takes one slot, the output panel takes two.  I don't see how you can cram a videocard in 1 slot without extenders (or modding the card).

He said it's a 5850.  Overclocked, one could push past 400 MH/s.  It's unlikely, nigh impossible, to get 2000, especially with air cooling.
I'm 99.9% sure you can't flash a 5850 to a 6990.

He's (potentially) getting less BTC with Deepbit because they charge fees.  If we ignore fees, any pool will pay out the same amount over time.  Larger pools, however, will pay out more consistently because they'll solve more blocks per day.
@_date: 2011-06-05 05:21:20
The network expects one block to be solved every ten minutes, or a bit over two-k blocks every two weeks.  If the blocks are solved prior to two weeks, the difficulty readjusts to get that two-week target again.

Looking at bitcoinity, it's also the volume of the buys/sells (which is likely due to the Mt Gox lag).  With low volumes of buy/sell orders, it's easy to move up &amp; down based on whatever gets fulfilled.  I noticed that at one point (according to bitcoinity) that it would have taken 60 btc to move from $37ish to $42ish.

BFL isn't Intel, AMD, or nVidia; they can move 400 units/day.  BFL is also not some guy in his garage painting birds on jewelry boxes and selling them on ebay; he can also move 400 a day.  
Now take the guy in the garage and tell him to make an Intel CPU, and that's pretty much what you have with BFL.  This should not be surprising.
Seriously, why aren't you happy they're actually shipping the things?  You think they'll be shipping 3/day next month?
@_date: 2013-04-23 22:38:23
You're naive if you think they'd be shipping 400 units a day when they first turn on the switches.  That's not how manufacturing works.  You gain efficiency with time, things don't just magically make themselves.
Plus, you have one data point.  Your claim is somewhat meaningless.
Furthermore, anyone that preordered BFL should be happy that units are being shipped at all.

Nothing.  The real question is why would BTC2 be adopted if it provides no improvements?  What's the incentive?
All the other variants of BTC can say the same thing regarding security/scarcity/etc.  Even if they did improve on the protocol (and some of them did), they didn't catch on as much.
BTC is successful because of adoption, and it isn't a stretch that it's widely adopted because it was first.

I think there's too much empty space in the left one.  The B appears better on the right to me (though it may not matter if seen from a distance).
The B looks too foreign to me on the left.
