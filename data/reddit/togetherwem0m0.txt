its neither good or bad. in the end, encryption is just a form of obfuscation. useful signals information can be obtained from merely understanding that peer a is communicating with peer b via tcp/ip stack.
zec and monero are both useful encryption implemntations that hide things, but say you're a nation state with full take sigint, you would be able to discern that a party were conducting a zec or monero transaction at a certain time and correlate that with other events and so on.

i mean, not exactly, but kind of.
basically, the constitution of the US, 4th ammendment, protects us against unreasonable search and seizure and is supposed to keep us secure in our papers. After 9/11 the last vestige of restraint was torn away and an effort was put in place to basically whole sale violate the 4th ammendment with systems that are intended to anaylze all the things. it starts small, but iterative improvement and all that eventually you get to a place you never intended.
The DHS themselves don't have direct access to these tools, but the NSA can be looped in and the dhs can retcon evidence to fit the stuff found through what should be illegal means.
the other shit part of this is that the arguement can be made that the 4th ammendment is not being violated if machines (AI and data mining tools) are being used on massive amounts of data to identify and highlight activities, since there's the interpretation that people are secure in the papers from other humans....
we're going to be putting a lot of trust in machines in order to bypass the constitution and this is very dangerous slippery slope stuff.

I agree which is why I think merchants like Amazon and overstock will be the chief offerer of lightning wallet nodes.
A 3rd party wallet provider has very little value to the public and Amazon wants to insert themselves between every transaction a customer makes with the wider world becsuse they will also have channels open with vendors and banking institutions as well.

Yes but you're probably more likely to have a channel open with a merchant in a few years, not an exchange.  Think Amazon or overstock. Overstock I mention of course because their CEO is very pro crypto.
So the merchant will be logical channel for most people and the merchant will be happy to subsidize their resource utilization and whatever other services the user may need. Maybe even including crypto banking services, loans, insurance. Fuck anything. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 22:22:16
In most cases I think this is a very reasonable statement, however I think with bitcoin it's uniquely subject to historical analysis because the causes of each dip are the same.
Early adopters taking gains. Each dip is negative fomo, early adopters saying this is a chance to take gains. This latest dip is timed pretty well with the end of the 2017 tax year so there's that too.
Most graphs of companies will never have this consistent reasoning because they don't experience exponential growth and uncertainty about the future. 
But yes this could all go horribly wrong because each dip is likely broken when people stop selling but demand remains or demand goes up and people stop selling. Who can say whether that will happen each time

why is that funny? i don't understand why its funny.
someone can, still today, take money that they would otherwise throw away or waste or hell even use on a traditional investment, and instead buy an immutable asset that is deflationary by default.
The upside is tremendous and if you're dealing with investment money, i.e. throw away money, and you don't go hogwild, yes still today we are talking about probably atleast 10x returns and that's just in 1 year. A longer time and we're again looking at 100x.
1000 -&gt; 10000 -&gt; 100000
this is not a laughing matter.
it could still be zero, but if you only use throw away money, what are you throwing away? you're taking a risk, a gamble, you're going out on a limb and buying what you believe in because you have read enough about the concept to understand it.
then hodl on.

I agree with everything you wrote. But it's not a weakness it's a feature. Every negative you brought up is also an opportunity for a service provider like a bank or amazon.com or whatever to provide that layer of consumer friendly services. Bitcoin is just the foundational layer. Secure financial services built on top of the blockchain that are reversible and subject to mediation are entirely plausible.
In the future you hopefully can make the choice to be your own bank but I will also likely choose to participate in whatever service is offered for its ease of use compared to what bitcoin is today

That's the thing here. We've aligned ourselves on the coattails of the "whales" during the early adopter phase. I mean there's a chance thus won't pan out and we will be left holding the bag, but I do t think so.
The whales interests are aligned with ours and the whales will get increasingly smaller as they themselves divest from their original holdings. If a whale attempts to crash the market it may backfire if there's enough other people to catch the ball. They will have divested themselves and not caused the crash they wanted so their short positions may not be favorable result.
The key for me over the past few years has been to imagine what an incredibly wealthy person might do and then try and position myself yo anticipate what might happen, because the 1% is defining things, they run the show and they are just amplifying their wealth at this point

Vendors and supplies must choose a common currency to transact in or else it is subject to exchange rate shenanigans. Currently exchange rate shenanigans of bitcoin are insane due to volatility and fees. I believe this problem is solvable with segwit implementation, lightning network and time. It will take time for bitcoin volatility to decrease because it needs to become widely distributed, and have a much higher market cap, like gold or the usd to achieve stability.
The fee problem Is the most important one to solve because evem with volatiloity a retailer would be willing to accept bitcoin and then they choose whether to save it or sell it to pay for their vendor. Ideally they wou la choose to save it.

We have a system that since 1980 has funneled more wealth into the hands of the top 1% than the bottom 80% in America. It didn't used to be this way. The USA between 1945 and 1970 was the definition of egalitarian opportunity for all with strong unions and public schools, affordable housing and affordable secondary education.
It's my opinion that the sheer existence of this wealth and income inequality is fundamentally what is driving the costs of healthcare for example. The price of professional services are driven to absurd levels because they are in demand by a segment of the population that will pay anything to receive top priority.
In order for me as a business owner to prosper I need to have a functional society to operate in. That takes roads and security, educated employees and so on. I can't do it without these inputs. At my level I pay for them! Lol but by percentage the people at the top do not pay their fair share to support our civil society.

There's no inflation seen for 99% of people because most of this liquidity is flowing into the 1%. Since inflation is caused by consumers having more ability for vendors to increase the prices of their goods and services, and wages are stagnant or decreasing, we shouldn't see much consumer inflation. I'm sure the 1% is seeing some inflation, but they're already in "Dont give a fuck" territory, so whatever economic expenses they see are no big deal.
we will see inflation in home prices and costs of secondary education and healthcare because political policy is still encoiuraging/enabling money flows into those sectors, thus causing inflation/prices to increase because of the mal assessment of peoples abilities to pay back mortgages and such.

God I'm so tired of bad analysis. Art isn't more of a bubble than bitcoin is but both are subject to the same forces that are causing stock market valuations to soar.
QE and the printing of money is causing inflation amongst the wealthy but not in consumer goods because all of the extra usd being printed isn't leaving "their" economy, yet. Stocks, art and so on are experiencing inflationary conditions that could be perceijved as a bubble but one of the shit things about bubbles is they have to end and I don't see an end in sight for wealth inequality. Things are only getting worse.
Bitcoin has the potential to reign in wealth inequality because it is sound money and a good store of value but it will take generations for the full effects yo be realized and cause the inflationary aspects of our society to self correct. At least j hope the correction is intergenerational cause if it's not we are hurting

Each time the price goes down more people buy in. This is the mechanism th at will distribute btc to more and more people legitimizing it

to me this whole "currency" thing is a giant red herring. Even if no one uses it as a currency, bitcoin still has huge potential value as a sound money alternative to gold, a world relevant store of value, that can be used for HUGE international and interbank transfers of value.
individual users don't ever have to use bitcoin as currency for it to have utility, if its the underpinning asset on which enough people agree.
for example, USD won't ever go away, but it may become a layer on top of bitcoin, that the traditional banking system still operates on.

Right now we have a major wealth and income inequality problem. It's a problem because few people hold too large a piece of the economic pie and too many hold too little of it. This creates a weird demand dynamic for things like medical care because the ultra wealthy aren't paying their share of societies healthcare burden.
We do need to tax wealthy people more and we do need to tax the entire population more. I would gladly pay much higher income taxes if it meant my families healthcare was taken care of and I didn't have to worry about going bankrupt if an accident or medical problem happened.
Moreover every small business owner I know wants single payer. We are being crushed by healthcare costs.

the ultra wealthy who werent early adopters can still see bitcoin as an opportunity for huge profits, so the interests of those people is important also, though they are largely going to invest in the actual tech and companies rather than the coin itself, some are going to hold coins too.

I used to think the way you do, about flat tax and equality of taxation, about what's fair and what's not. That was before though I realized the scale of our countries (worlds?) Wealth and income inequality problem.
People like you and me are not exposesd to that world, we are so far removed from it we don't even know it exists because they literally are from a different world. We don't see them, so we can't factor in that economic reality unless we go 50000 feet up. What I do to gain this perspective is use Google maps and inspect the ultra wealthy gated enclaves, and then similarly to look at poor rural areas and devastated urban areas. Then I use Zillow and other property information tools to add to my perspective. Then I'll go look at charts that demonstrate that 90% of the countries income is held by the top 10%.
Then I take all of that and i wonder about what that means to the various markets and in this case especially healthcare. 
If we want a society where everyone has healthc are at rates they can afford then we need a society that more equally (not perfectly equally, not socialist) just more equally allocates economic resources, because under the current system the wealthy people are able to bid up the cost of services on a limited expertise market. Doctors hospitals engineers and scientists who create new treatment and technology are responding to the economic condition ofbthr ultra wealthy because that's where the revenue is coming from at the moment. Revenue doesn't come from the poor, because they can't pay.
Now you might say well it sounds like the ultra wealthy are paying more than their fair share and that's obviously true but the problem is they are receiving services and the poor are not.
I am extremely worried about the slope of the wealth inequality curve because I can recognize that my family is on the "doesn't have intergenerational wealth" side of the equation and if my kids are poor in the future what does that mean will happen to them? They won't have access to healthcare.
I want everyone to have healthc are and opportunity because if everyone has healthc are and opportunity then we will.all benefit. Every single person deserves security of their health so they can pursue interests they might not otherwise pursue.
There's a good chance we do live in separate world's because we don't have the sa.e perspective or same flows of information. What I worry about more than anything is that most people don't understand or can't comprehend the effects of wealth and income inequality until it's too late.

You are probably not in the wealthy tax brackets I'm referring to. I am also a business owner in an upper tax bracket but the 1% achieve a level of wealth inequality we can't even fathom.
You and I have much more in common with the people in poverty than we do with the ultra wealthy.
This is I think actually one of our biggest problems as a society. Too many people in the upper tax brackets think of themselves as wealthy when in reality anyone making under 400k a year is in relative poverty compared to the people I'm talking about.

It's potentially worse than that.
I had a vision today of something I might call the bitcoin war. This isn't fleshed out and it's highly speculative but if China, Rus and Saudis seek to undermine the usd hegemony, they could do so quite easily with bitcoin.
Now what happens in a world where the United States favorite tool of global control is eliminated? We are talking major fucking war as the us seeks to maintain power and control.
Of course that war is only plausible so long as the us government represents the best profit or stability opportunity for the wealthy elite. If they have other options or prefer the bitcoin system then there may not be a war unless the usgov is taken over by ideologues, which is possible if the us eco O my tanks.
Of course all this speculation is for naught if satoshi nakamato was a pseudonym for the nsa or cia; either of which is technically plausible which would give the us gov a huge controlling interest in the largest chunk of bitcoin

Resistive heating and processors will put out almost exactly the same btus per watt since they are doing almost the same thing. The electrical used for actual processing is less than 1% of the total energy used. So one is not more efficient than the other as it relates to generating heat, or rather, only very marginally so so marginally as to be meaningless in difference
Now imparting that heat in a directed manner towards it's purpose? That's where efficiency comes in. How much of the heat transfer occurs in a bitcoin mining rig directly into the water? Probably less than what a purpose built resistive heater would. 
The real innovation here if you could call it that would be a purpose built water heater with efficiently designed thermal transfer surfaces that would impart the heat in an efficient manner directly into water

There was a window of time early on, around gox or earlier where regulation could crush bitcoin, but it's too late now. Too many powerful people are inves red and control the regulatory decisions. They have a financial incentive in its success, just like all the companies designing solutions around bitcoin do as well.

With the etf denial there's no  clear moon strategy. Medium fish hodlers might begin to liquidate slowly but they won't kill the market. The market will stagnate between 1000 and 1250 for a while before either going below 1k or recovering if the Winklecoss twins or another large hodler figure out a way to build the institutional investor onramp.
People are concurrently increasing holdings in ether as a hedge because ether is bitcoin 2.0 and while newer it's extensible nature makes it far more exciting of a platform for innovation. Bitcoin proved the distributed ledger but ether has evolved innovation and a better management team not to mention a team that built in a self funding mechanism for management.

Trezor's are really cool, but they're the 1st generation hardware wallet.
what if people actually had like, real wallets someday, with a trezor built into them. a usb jack, or whatever future peripheral wireless (unlikely) or wired jack, you could easily plug in to whatever terminal you're using that is ubiquitously compatible private key storage device.
not just that of course but it would also continue to do u2f or whatever any other privkey solution you need, just like trezor does today.
so like, everyone's used to carrying around wallets on their person, it's not too far a leap to integrate a future gen trezor electronics hidden in the fabric of these common apparel items. the needed circuit board and display should continue to aggressively improve and lower cost.

The united states currently and probably for a short amount of remaining time, occupies the top of the global order through petrodollar hegemony.
When you're a global competitor like Russia and China the opportunities to hack at the ankles of the US are unlimited. Take part of ukraine, sponsor economic espionage to steal tech and building plans, so on and so on. One of the final ways to combat the petrodollar would be to support and promote a global currency alternative, like bitcoin, that may lead the way to debasing the USD hegemony.
At $100 million dollars, this is very very cheap compared to the potential of contributing and supporting a global economy that isnt subject to USD hegemony.

There is tons of room in financial services industry for a bank that is competent to safeguard crypto assets.
In fact, I'm of the opinion, and I dont know how anyone could not honestly, that the only way to greater adoption is financial services company providing human interfaces to the blockchain itself and perhaps even side chain transactions.
This idea is lost on early bitcoin libertarian diehards but most things of organized complexity are lost on pure libertarians. The fact is most of the worlds population need a service provider to bank and safeguard their assets and I see absolutely nothing wrong with that and in fact I welcome it intensely

Welp I am thinking of a variety of ways but the biggest would be creation of a walled garden that enables more intracompany trust and functionality.
The biggest functionality would be things like chargebacks, bitcoin credit systems, loans etc. These extended functions of banking only work with trust. With ln, a walled garden of pre approved companies xpild be created and enforced where it couldn't on bitcoin proper because ln is a side chain and can do whatever the people running the ln node program it to do. They dont even all have to run the same software just be protocol complete and add extended protocol functionality.

Youre not asking the right question. Getting caught has significant downside. Are you prepared to take that risk no matter how you're found out? Is it worth the effort to avoid likely or know reporting methods? Will your evasion show up on other more dangerous reporting and signals intelligence?

Linux is amazing. I use it every day. Using linux is perfectly reasonable of course. I am not saying Linux is awful, I am saying Microsoft isn't awful and that comparing Windows and Linux is no longer relevant. Linux has its role and its a wonderful learning tool. The great thing about Linux is it only does what you tell it to. The bad thing about Linux is it only does what you tell it to.
The future for most people in the world is going to involve using devices that run operating systems that have to collect data in order to perform tasks and provide services that people find useful. There is no future i can see where that won't happen, and linux won't be a significant part of that future vision because there are no revenues to support the workers and engineers to build that future vision.
open source success depends on starvation and volunteerism. The revenue model isn't there. People use it to learn on and then get hired by companies that can pay them to do useful things, to them.
and now is when we loop in the next piece of the discussion which is economics related and what bitcoin is and why our current system of endentured servitude and weird incentive structures causes problems, and why personal financial freedom is and can be important. though honestly sometimes i wonder if cryptocurrency is extremely similar to the internet.
when we first built the internet, and open soruce software, super smart egalitarian people envisioned it as leading to an enlightenment. look what actually happened, we got fake news everywhere and direct taps into peoples brains enabling psyops like never before. i wonder if we're not making the same mistake with cryptocurrencies, even though the fed isn't to be trusted either.
in the end, i love bitcoin for the same reasons i love linux. i do believe in long enough term it will lead to good things, just like i think the internet still can. i just know what microsoft's goals are and think their revenues and business model are sound for the future needs of businesses.

I'm sorry but there is no get command in nntp. Your thesis is flawed and there is no comparison available between http and nntp. The overlap of the command "post" is pure coincidence and the usage of the verb post in http protocol is entirely different than the way it's used in nntp.
Nntp and http are cousins at best if only because they share some techno logical roots in internet protocols and operate in layer 4

Microsoft's data collection strategy and privacy policies are far more restrictive than googles chrome os stack and Google and Facebook's internet property data collection strategy.

This thread is so far a very depressing read. Every single op is advocating for lying during marriage, lying before marriage and lying after marriage.
You get married because you love someone, trust someone, and want to be with that person for as long as your alive. When you get married you are agreeing to share resources, joint ownership, because in a marriage there is often unequal sharing of responsibility (as it relates to money resources anyway) if you have kids then one of the couple is inevitably giving up more than the other.
Geez guys it doesn't even matter if bitcoin is an asset or a currency. Joint ownership still applies in our society because it's based on English common law.
I am perhaps even more upset at the author of the article. There is zero qualities of bitcoin that make it different enough to need it's own laws. It's not complicated at all and courts have been deciding asset splitting during divorces forever.
So to all you people advocating for usurping our current system of legal marriage and joint ownership, wise up. There are good reasons to have marriage in a civil society and its still and always be an institution that is part of civil society. Imaginujng that cryptocurrency is somehow a different thing that changes anything about it is complete nonsense and these posts being made are pretty fucking shitty

this may be complete bullshit but my current thinking on this is that these finance people, or c level folks, you know, they love to say that blochain is not bitcoin and bitcoin is not blockchain, which is true. i mean you can start your own blockchain from bitcoin obviously or invent your own, but the big thing missing here with starting your own chain is the decentralization of the proof of work. i mean, that's what bitcoins security comes from is its widely distributed and massive unattackable profile due to its size. any competing blockchain, especially a specialits blockchain, will probably be subject to attacks.
if im putting on my futurist cap here, its hard for me to fathom that another chain can usurp bitcoin in such a way as to securitize a blockchain correctly.
so here's an example, the blockchain in transport alliance. a standards body to digitize freight is their goal. a worthy goal, but the standards body has to agree to standardize on one particular block chain. who's going to be trusted to operate that block chain? the only one in the room i can think of to trust is bitcoin, because bitcoins proof of work adoption is so fantastically dominant. there's no one to trust, its a global open system.
competing private blockchains may work like a blockchain but they will always be runners up to the big boy in the room.
i think this might be the first time i realized bitcoins not going anywhere. i mean ive believed in it, but i feel like i understand now how it will happen.

Nope. Thats not a correct conclusion about what i said. I don't want communism at all. I recognize however the historical affects of out of control wealth and income inequality and seek to avoid them. It's clear our oligarchal, crony capitalist system is not working for the majority of the people and we need to fix that. The only way I see to fix it is through a series of reforms that involves eliminating massive government loan subsidies (housing and student loans) gradually over a 2 decades time period to wind down those bubbles while raising taxes on the ultra wealthy to reduce the wealth and income inequality gap.
At th3 3nd the goal is to have a more sound capitalist economy with a government of the people that avoids passing laws that benefit corpora he interest at the expense of the people

The source of erratic valuation is the limited size of the marketplace. Once bitcoin is adopted more and more the fluctuations will be les and less.
That said I think we have 2 or 3 more boom bust cycles until wide bitcoin adoption so people will say the things you say for quite a while yet.
The cause of these boom bust cycles is fomo, but the dome spreads awareness and adoption. Then a 2 or more year period of slower adoption and then it will ramp up again..

you know, i don't think it's worth digging into the details. We don't know the fact pattern at play here. Yes, you're right, there are certain things, in certain states, that can lead to an uneven distribution of property. I think premarital property is the clearest one because in the case of a short marriage, in many states, what you had before marriage is a big factor if the decision makes it to the judge and isn't settled before hand.
suffice to say, divorces are complicated matters. My post is squarely focused in criticism at people who are advocating in this thread to lie and perjure themselves, hiding assets and so on as a way to subvert the laws in their states as it relates to property ownership and deprive their spouses of a fair hearing/seperation of comingled or shared ownership assets during divorces.

I think we will see a run up to 35k in December of 2018 and then a crash down to 15k, 6 more months of bitcoin is dead then 75k.
Depends on a lot of factors tho. As soon as people (ai?) Start leaving the stock market the available money needs to go somewhere. Stay in cash or go to property, bonds, gold or bitcoin. If property is crashing then people may see bitcoin as a huge opportunity since it is currently hugely undervalued if it's a true world currency.

im sure there are a confluence of factors but this recent increase coincides with trends in bitcoin to have an inflationary period followed by profit taking.
i predict this current period of valuation increase will take us to 10k in 2 weeks and then follow by profit taking to 8k or so. this will be a 2 month cycle, which after that round of profit taking will accelerate to 20k by March 18 before profit taking to 15k

you're actually not correct.
cost of goods (consumer price inflation) is not necessarily related at all to the inflation rate of the US Dollar. This is because cost of material, labor and so on may stagnate vs inflation, cost of production per unit decreasing due to automation and also competitive market forces amongst other reasons why the 2 are not directly linked.
my personal observation is that the cost of bread has remained pretty close to $2 during the cited 10 year time period.

There is a role for banking institutions in the future and this is it. Trusted, audited, insured custodians of blockchain private keys is a totally legitimste fujction of a future bank that engages in crypto deposits.
Today in 2018 you can be your own bank (hold private keys) but the reality is normies don't want that complication. Banks can still play a huge role.
I would not be surprised one bit if some day amazon.com stepped into that role themselves. Why not bank with amazon.com for secure bitcoin banking?

Depends on if you can make the link to say technical innovation was enabled by fractional reserve lending, and that the technical innovationnweve experienced wouldn't have happened without fractional reserve lending.
I think frl has pros and cons. It definitely has done a great many things that all influence each other so it's hard to peel out good or bad on net

I am feeling more and more like this is a delusional falsehood. With technology coming online that is allowing individualized targeted campaigns to sway their opinions, at what point does the truth become impossible to discover, or another way, at what point does the truth not win the day over the masses? Are we already therr?

it doesnt take a week or more to confirm. it takes a month to reach settlement, but that's by design, because there's a company in the middle extending credit.

simply put, bitcoin is either going to 0 or its going to the moon.
there's no inbetween. right now, its not only inbetween, its near the beginning.
bitcoin hodling is a risk, but its a risk with a huge upside at the moment. not exposing yourself to this risk means you're not appropriately allocating.

It doesnt just take time.
Humans will always need servicers to help keep their wealth and provide value add services.
The first major bank to offer retail bitcoin storage services will be when you know things are really happening.
It is hard being your own bank. There are things you dont and cant do well..a bank will be critical to wider adoption. 
Im not saying those who want to keep their own keys cant. Just that at some point banks will be neccessary
